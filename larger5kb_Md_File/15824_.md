The purpose of this seminar is twofold. First, the seminar aims to introduce
and explore together core literature and issues within contemporary Science
and Technology Studies (STS), drawing primarily upon contributions from
sociology, anthropology, political science, history and cultural studies.
Critiques of these approaches will also be explicitly examined. Second, the
seminar aims to provide an opportunity for students to actively relate the
various theoretical and methodological approaches to their own work and
intellectual interests, asking how interpretations of selected STS approaches
might enhance and/or be enhanced by their own academic perspectives and
experiences. Most seminars will begin with a short introductory lecture which
contextualizes the seminar literature and authors. Reading and discussion are
however the focus of the seminar, and participants will be expected to take
turns leading the group in exploring themes and questions from the assigned
readings. In addition, participants will be given informal opportunities for
on-going assessment/critique of the content and structure of seminar in order
to enable continued relevance to group interests and goals.



    If the relative ontological status of a phenomenon is inextricably embedded in the conditions of production ...     the question on a meta-level becomes: How can we make a revolution that will be ontologically and     epistemologically pluralist yet morally responsible?     Susan Leigh Star

**DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES**

This course is a survey of American society from the Civil War to the Present
with an emphasis on the role of social life, politics, and economic change.
Students will be encouraged to understand and analyze specific controversies
and events in the interpretation of American history.

**EXAMS AND ASSIGNMENTS**

There will be a midterm and a final.  Both of these exams will be 100 percent
essay and will test knowledge and understanding of the text, lecture, and
other readings. Makeups _must_ be arranged in advance of the exam date.

**ATTENDANCE**

Attendance will be rewarded.  Students who are borderline on the final course
grade and have missed no more than three classes (lectures and sections) will
receive a one percent "bump" to a higher letter grade.  Those who miss more
than three classes will be graded purely on the basis of points.  There are no
excused absences.

**ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT POLICY**

All acts of dishonesty in any work constitute acts of academic misconduct.
The Academic Misconduct Disciplinary Policy will be followed in the event of
academic misconduct.

**SUMMARIES AND DISCUSSIONS**

To facilitate discussion in section, all students are required to write ten
weekly summaries.  Each summary will discuss _all_ of the readings for one
week.

The only readings which do not have to be summarized are the chapters from
_America_ by George Tindall and David Shi.   Please note, however, that
students will be required to summarize the amendments of the Constitution of
the United States which are reproduced in the appendix of _America_.

Every summary will be due at the beginning of lecture each Monday (unless
otherwise announced on the syllabus or by the instructor) and can only cover
the readings for that week.  It will be corrected and returned in the section
for that week.

The summary must be typed (no smaller than 9 point size type).  The text
(unless otherwise announced on the syllabus) cannot be any longer than 36
lines.  Margins should be about one inch on each side.  In addition, each
summary should include a question at the end to facilitate the discussion.
The question should deal with some aspect of one or more of the readings.

Each weekly summary will be worth a maximum of 10 points.  Points will be
deducted if a reading or question for that week is not included.

A summary cannot be turned in late or made up.  It is possible, however, to
raise the grade by writing a revised version.  The revised version (which
_must_ be stapled to a copy of the original) will be due in lecture on Monday.

**GRADING REQUIREMENTS**

100 pts. Midterm  
100 pts. Final

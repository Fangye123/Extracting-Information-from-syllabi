INTRODUCTION: HIS 273, CONTEMPORARY JAPAN IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE represents
a course of study designed to introduce contemporary Japanese culture and
civilization to an audience encountering the formal study of Japan for the
first time. An analytical examination of the various component parts
comprising life in Japan today will be conducted against an historical
backdrop and (implicitly) in comparison with contemporary American culture and
society; both visual and literary resources will be used as source material
for our exploration. Students should expect to emerge from the course with
both an historical understanding of the roots of contemporary Japan and an
appreciation of the complexity of modem Japanese life and culture.

COURSE OBJECTIVES: At the end of ten weeks of instruction, students enrolled
in HIS 273, CONTEMPORARY JAPAN IN HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE should be able to --

* identify and explain the significance of basic terms, personalities and concepts associated with the study of contemporary Japanese civilization and culture.
* discuss with insight the major characteristics of modern Japanese social, political, economic and religious systems, institutions and beliefs.
* discuss with insight aspects of both contemporary Japanese popular culture and the traditional Japanese fine arts and literature maintained in Japan today.
* characterize the impact of both past traditions and the modern West on contemporary Japanese life and culture
* discuss with insight contemporary affairs, issues and problems (both internal and external) involving Japan.
COURSE REQUIREMENTS: REGULAR CLASS ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION IN DISCUSSION
ARE BASIC COURSE REQUIREMENTS as is the completion of the reading assigned in
the accompanying class schedule. Required reading for the course includes
Taichi Sakaiya's _What Is Japan? Contradictions and Transformations_ , Richard
McGregor's _Japan Swings: Politics, Culture and Sex in the New Japan_ ,
Stephen Addiss' _How to Look at Japanese 4rt_ and the collection of articles
and excerpts on reserve in the Cleveland State University library.

In addition the class will be asked to complete two research assignments: the
first, an interpretive essay (nine to eleven pages in length) discussing \- in
two parts (descriptive and analytical) -- an aspect of contemporary Japanese
life in historical perspective; the second (including a written personality
profile and a series of public opinion survey questions) requiring each
student to assume a contemporary Japanese personality appropriate to a role-
playing exercise concluding the course of study. An on-going series of journal
assignments must also be completed and shared with the instructor at intervals
prescribed in the syllabus. There will be weekly quizzes on the assigned
reading but no other examinations required in the course.

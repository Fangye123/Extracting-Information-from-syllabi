## Course Syllabus

This course is an introduction to understanding issues of diversity and social
justice in the United States. The course provides students with 1) a
theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of oppression, 2) an
opportunity to expand their knowledge and awareness of two specific forms of
oppression, and 3) a process to explore how these two specific forms of
oppression affect their personal and professional lives. We focus on sexism,
heterosexism, and anti-semitism during the fall semester and ableism,
classism, and racism during the spring semester.

**Course Format:** The course will meet one day (9am-5pm) in the beginning of
the semester ( **Friday, February 1** ). Students will then participate in two
of three weekend seminars offered during the semester. Weekend seminars meet
from 9am-5pm on Saturday and Sunday. Students will select their weekend
seminar preferences on the first day of class. A final day (9am-5pm) session
will meet at the end of the semester ( **Friday, May 3** ). All class sessions
will break for lunch from approximately 12:30-1:30. The weekend seminar dates
for the spring semester are:

> **Ableism: March 2-3**

>

> **Classism: April 6-7**

>

> **Racism: April 20-21**

**Grading** : This is a mandatory pass/fail course. To receive a pass,
students must attend all class sessions, complete reading assignments prior to
each weekend seminar, and write a reading reaction paper and seminar reaction
paper for both weekends. Students must also attend an out of class event of
their choosing related to the topic of each weekend seminar and write a short
description of and reaction to that event. Students will be evaluated on how
thoroughly they respond to each written assignment. Students will not be
evaluated on the content of their beliefs or whether or not they agree with
perspectives discussed in class. Please plan your time so that you can
complete class assignments by the end of the semester. Incompletes will be
given only for extenuating circumstances that prevent the completion of all
written work by the last class session or attendance at all class meetings.
Incompletes will only be used when arrangements for the incomplete have been
made prior to the last class session. All incompletes given for extenuating
circumstances must be completed before the beginning of the next semester or
they will become Fs.

**Specific Requirements** : To receive a passing grade, each student is
required to attend both all-day Friday classes and two weekend seminars. In
addition, each student must:

1\. Read the assigned books for each weekend attended All books available at
Food For Thought Books in Amherst.

2\. Write a reading reaction paper for EACH weekend seminar attended. This
paper should be 5-7 typed, double-spaced pages. Discuss all books assigned for
each weekend topic in your reading reaction. Integrate references to these
readings into your paper. Questions that might be addressed in reading
reaction papers include:

for you? Why?  
>  ， What information or perspectives would you like to explore further?

>

> The reading reaction paper is due on Saturday morning of the seminar for
this topic. You will not be admitted to the weekend without turning in a
readings reaction paper. Seminar leaders will read and make written comments
on all reaction papers. Reading reactions will be returned at the last class
session. If you want your paper before that time, include a self-address
stamped 8 1/2.x 11 envelope when you turn your paper in.

3\. Write a seminar reflection paper for EACH weekend seminar attended. These
papers should be at least 5-7 typed, double-spaced pages. This paper should
focus on your own personal learning from the weekend. The reaction papers
should focus on a) what you have learned about how this form of oppression
affects you and b) your reactions to what you learned in the weekend seminar.
Questions that should be addressed in personal reaction papers include:

> What were your learning edges during the seminar?  
>  What have you learned about your agent/target identities?  
>  What questions are raised for you as a result of participating in this
seminar?  
>  How might you collude to perpetuate this form of oppression?  
>  How do your other social group memberships affect your experience of this
form of oppression?

personal and/or professional life (Changes in your relationships with friends,
family, students and colleagues)?  
>  How can what you learned in the weekend be used to change schools or other
institutions or organizations with which you are associated?

Personal reflection papers are due on the second Monday after the weekend is
completed. They can be turned in to Pat's office (368 Hills South) or Pat's
mailbox in 159 Hills South. All reaction papers will be returned during the
last class session in May. If you want your paper before the end of the
semester, include a self-address stamped 8 1/2.x 11 envelope when you turn
your paper in. Seminar leaders will read and make written comments on all
reaction papers.

4\. Attend a social, political, cultural, or educational event related to EACH
seminar in which you participate. Try to choose an event that you would not
typically attend or participate in. If possible, attend this event after you
have participated in the weekend seminar. Write a short description of the
event (1-2 paragraphs). Then discuss your reactions to the event given what
you have learned in the seminar. The paper should be about 2 pages in length.
Examples of events to attend are films, plays, marches, vigils, rallies,
concerts, lectures, poetry readings, art or photography exhibits, dances,
meetings open to the public, workshops or seminars. Renting a video and
watching it at home does not meet the requirement for this assignment.
Questions that can be addressed in the paper include:

> What were your thoughts and feelings about attending this event?  
>  How did your status as an agent/target in relationship to the focus of the
event affect your feelings about attending?  
>  What about the event was challenging?  
>  How did what you learned in the weekend seminar and readings affect your
perspectives about this event?  
>  What new information did you learn?  
>  How did your other social group memberships interact to affect your
reactions to this event?

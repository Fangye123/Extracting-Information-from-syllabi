**Objectives by Theme**

>  PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. What are the physical, cultural, economic, and/or historical criteria
(characteristics) used to define this realm and the regions within it? Why are
the boundaries drawn where they are?

>   2. Using maps found in the textbook's introduction (figures I-9, I-4, I-6,
I-7, and I-8), your atlas, and the appropriate textbook chapter, explain where
most people live in this realm and where few people live. Why do they live
there or not live there?

>     1.  Previous Harper geography students have identified five criteria
which may explain where people live: 1) near fresh water, 2) flat terrain, 3)
near coasts, 4) temperate climate, and 5) fertile soil. Are these applicable
to this realm?

>

>

> CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. As the European Union grows larger and more united, devolution is
occurring within many countries. Be able to use the chapter vocabulary to
explain examples of such devolution, especially the balkanization of the
former Yugoslavia and Bosnia.

>

>

> ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1.  "Yet, despite its comparatively small size, for more than 2,000 years
the European Realm has been a leading focus of human achievement, a hearth of
innovation and invention." (de Blij/Muller p. 45) Why?

>   2. Throughout the world, countries are moving toward free trade as a means
to promote economic development. Why? Europe provides a good case study of the
benefits of international trade (what the authors call "Intensifying Spatial
Interaction") as the realm moves toward greater economic integration (European
Union).

>

>

> HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Discuss the three "Revolutions of Modernizing Europe".

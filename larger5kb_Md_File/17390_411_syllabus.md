"The free access which many young people have to romances, novels, and plays
has poisoned the mind and corrupted the morals of many a promising youth: and
prevented others from improving their minds in useful knowledge. . . . Novels
are written in order to catch the imagination of the and to beguile it into
vice and error unawares."  
 \--The Reverend Enos Hitchcock, 1790  
    
**Description**  
The novel was considered a dangerous art form in the early American republic.
Why?  And in what ways did the novel serve to critique the era's dominant
ideology while at the same time serve it? This class investigates the rise of
the novel in early America, paying special attention to how the novel both was
shaped by and shaped an emerging national identity.  We will look at the novel
as a literary, cultural, and ideological form, a form whose emergence cannot
be fully understood unless studied in light of the profound cultural
transformations--especially in terms of politics, gender, and race--of the
early republic.  


**Graded Coursework**

**Web Assignment**  
Study the Theodore De Bry Copper Plate Engravings available on-line at   [De
Bry Copper Plate Engravings](http://www.csulb.edu/gc/libarts/am-
indian/woodcuts/)  
These engravings--published in the 1590s by De Bry as part of his Eurpoean
chronicles of the "new world"\--represent images of the of the Carolina
Algonquians, living in what is now North Carolina.  For further context and
background, take a look at the chapter "Repetition and Resistance in the
Representation of Roanoke" in Eric Cheyfitz's book The Poetics of Imperialism:
Translation and Colonization from The Tempest to Tarzan (Philadelphia:  Univ.
of Pennsylvania Press, 1997) as well as The American Drawings of John White,
1577-1590 by Paul Hulton and David Beers Quinn (London:  The Trustees of the
British Museum, 1964).  Also helpful is Karen Ordahl Kupperman's Roanoke:  The
Abandoned Colony (Totowa, NJ:  Rowman and Allanheld, 1984).

Write an analysis of the several woodcuts that pays attention to questions
like these:  


  * In what ways are the Natives represented as "natural" or connected to the earth or the natural world?
  * How do the Natives seemed artifically posed and what is the effect of this?
  * How do the engravings pattern or mimic the dominant narratives of exploration and conquest?
  * How do the engravings transform the Natives from subjects (active and possessing agency) into objects (passive, to-be-looked-at).

E-mail or htp your essay to me, along with an attached file of the woodcuts.

I will determine your grade based on three components:  the quality of your
in-class performance (including the two article summaries, the two paragraphs,
and your weekly on-line dialogues, 45% of your grade); and the quality of the
portfolio of work that you hand in at the end of the semester (55% of grade).

1\. Two short paragraphs responding to the assigned portion of the NOVEL we
are reading for that day (15% of grade--paragraphs no more than 200 words):
Two times during the semester, I will ask you to write a paragraph that you
will bring into class on that day. These paragraphs should be succinct and to
the point, without introductory material, and in your speaking ("I") voice.
Think of these paragraphs as instigators, designed to elicit thinking
responses from your classmates; I will grade them at least partly on how well
they produce useful discussion.  You should see these paragraphs as
significant opportunities to for you to determine the agenda of the class.
Therefore, your paragraphs should be about what you want to focus on in the
class and why.  The paragraph should explain the following:  i) what part of
the reading interests you, ii) what questions do you want to pose for
discussion regarding it, iii) how do you think we should approach your
questions, and iv) what do you think we will gain by discussing these
particular concerns.  Your paragraph should take no more than 2 minutes to
read, and you should design them to be read aloud.  I will grade them on the
basis of their intellectual intensity, clarity, and curiosity.

2\. Two article summaries/talking points (15% of grade):  These readings
reflect some of the most influential critical scholarship of the last 15 years
and are designed to introduce you to the methods of literary criticism and to
the kinds of issues that have dominated scholarly work on early American
literary and cultural studies.  I have assigned throughout the semester a
number of one-page summaries of the articles we read for class.  You can
choose which articles sound most interesting to you (they are marked "handout,
summary" or "summary") and turn in your summary to me on the day the article
is assigned.  These MUST be typed and be no longer than one page.  Do not use
"I" instead adopting a more formal tone, (i.e., "in her article on Dickinson's
bee poems, Susan R. Van Dyne shows that . . . ").  Your summary should follow
this format:

  * begin with a  one-paragraph, objective summary of the article
  * next, list what you think are the most interesting/useful/challenging points
  * finally what, to your mind, key questions does the article generate, either about the general topic or related to the novels we are reading

These should NOT be more than one page long.  


3\. Weekly Query Responses (15% of grade, approximately 500 words each):  Once
a week, you need to visit the College of Liberal Arts Query section
(http://libarts.udmercy.edu), find the ENL 411:  RISE OF NOVEL button, read
over your classmates' entries, and submit your own dialogue.  This serves as a
kind of virtual and continuing class discussion, one where you have a little
more time to consider the issues and topics before responding.  Although these
should be relatively informal responses in terms of tone (you can use "I,"
etc.) I DO expect the dialogues to be substantial, thoughtful, and
constructive. Very often students find that these dialogues help in generating
ideas for paper topics; feel free to use them, on occasion, to pose direct
questions to your classmates.  Please avoid using the dialogues to express
unarguable personal opinions about what we are reading or talking about (i.e.,
"I really thought chapter 12 was unrealistic"), instead keeping your comments
more analytical ("I found it interesting how Brown--a male--used a female
narrator to tell the story in Wieland.")  I will check these dialogues weekly
--and perhaps intervene occasionally--but I truly want this to be YOUR site.
At the end of the term I will print the entire site and determine your grade
based on the frequency of your entries (at least once a week) and their
quality.

4\. The Portfolio (55% of grade):  This should represent your best work of the
semester.  Each portfolio will contain the following items:

  * One short essay (between 3-5 pages): This paper should emerge out of a question or problem you'd like to explore in print.  We'll talk  ore about this during the semester.  This paper is due in draft any time before Friday, February 19.
  * One long paper (15-20 pages):  This paper should be along the lines of the articles we read during the semester and should follow the conventions of critical articles.  It is probably best to think of this essay as a longer version of the shorter paper, except that you will be intervening in a current, real, existing discussion occurring in print.  This means that the aim of this essay is still to challenge and transform existing interpretations of your text(s) in question, but that those existing interpretations will be gathered from recent published literary criticism.  This paper must cite at least EIGHT secondary sources.  The paper is due in draft any time before Friday, April 9.

**Absences**  
You need to come to class and participate.   Over the course of the term I
will allow you three absences (excused or unexcused--it doesn't matter).
Missing more than three classes will significantly lower your grade, since it
will inhibit your ability to contribute significantly to our class
discussions.  You should count on 4-5 absences lowering your grade by 1/3 of a
grade (B to a B-, for example), 6-7 by 2/3 (B to a C+), 8-9 by a full grade (B
to a C).  If you miss more than 10 classes you will fail the course.

#  Syllabus

  * You must have taken MBA 520 Organizational Behavior or MC 512 Organizational Dynamics, Management, and  
Leadership or an equivalent course before registering for this course.  You
may not take this course simultaneously with MBA 520.

  * You are responsible for reading, understanding, and following **all** aspects of the syllabus. 

  * Full attendance at both Saturday sessions (December 2 and February 10) is **absolutely** required.   The sessions are held at the _**Downtown Campus   **_(The class does not meet at Rice or Galvin because we feel that it is easy for suburban students to get Downtown twice by car or train, while we have found it is extremely difficult for some downtown students to get to the suburban campuses.)

  * **Don't wait for the first class meeting!!** There is a lot to do in the first two weeks. If you show up for the first class meeting on December 2 without having electronically submitted the first two weeks of work, you will discover that you have already been dropped from the course!!!

  
  
#### THE EXPERIMENT

  * Move some student interactions with the teacher and with other students from the classroom to the Internet. 

  * Reduce class meeting time from eleven nights (36 hours) to two all day sessions. (14 hours) 

  * Increase reading, online interaction, and other homework by about that twenty hour difference. 

|

#### WHAT YOU WILL LEARN

MGT 551 is designed to introduce you to theories and knowledge which prepare
you to understand organizational structure and dynamics, and to make informed
decisions about organizational design. The impacts of global cultures,
communication technologies, and the speed of changes in the business
environment are included. |

#### WHAT YOU WILL DO

  * Attend two all day classes at the Downtown Campus, Dec 2 and Feb 10 

  * Interact weekly with your classmates about theory based readings 

  * Write two papers relating theory to your reality. 

  * Join a team in discovering and documenting knowledge and resources in an area of interest. 

  
  
The course requires uses of the Internet which are **not** taught as part of
the course. You must develop these abilities yourself, with the assistance of
the computer lab or other resources. **Don't panic**.  Students who started
the cyberspace classes last year with little or no technical preparation did
quite well in the classes, by investing a little time and effort learning how
to use the resources.

and beyond. The course addresses the history of the development of the

CLASS REPORT_  
Individual or teams of students will make class presentations of approximately
15 minutes on A OR B.

  1. Qu'ran project: 

Focus on a selection from the Qu'ran. It may be one entire Sura OR all the
passages about a prophet (see Denny p. 94 for a list; do not report on
Muhammad), or a topic (such as marriage or divorce, one of the five pillars,
angels and/or jinn, Christian s and/or Jews). Use an index to find the Qu'ran
passages related to your subject and read them over carefully. What sense do
you make of them? Do they set forth a belief or describe a practice? You may
consult secondary sources if you wish, BUT your main assignment is to read a
brief portion of the Qu'ran for yourself and explain it to the class.

  
B. A current issue in Islam  
Research a current issue in Islam.

The following "KISS" schema may be helpful:  
_Knowledge:_ What two or three interesting things did I learn about this
issue?  
_Interpretation_ : How does this issue fit into what I've learned about Islam?  
_Sources_ :  Who is talking about this issue; where did I get my information
and why  
do I think this is a reliable source?  
_So what:_ What is the significance of this issue for Muslims and other
Americans?  

The following are some possible topics/resources:

1\. Women and Islam

  1. Geraldine Brooks, _Nine Parts of Desire_ (1995) This is an account by an American woman journalist of her encounters with Islam in the Near East in the early 1990s. 
  2. Fatima Mernissi, _Dreams of Trespass: Tales of a Harem Girlhood_ (1994) This is an autobiography about growing up Muslim in Morocco in the early days after WWII.
  3. Yvonne Yazbeck Haddad and John L. Esposity, editors, _Islam, Gender, & Social Change_ (1998) The introduction OR any ONE of chapters one to three of this very current anthology would be sufficient material to cover.) 

2\. Muslims speak for Islam

  1. Hammuday Abdalati, _Islam in Focus_ (1995) This publication of the World Assembly of Muslim Youth presents Islam to Americans from a devoted Muslim viewpoint; any one chapter would be sufficient material to cover.
  2. The Islamic Affairs Department of the Embassy of Saudi Arabia, Washington, D. C. _Understanding Islam and the Muslims_ and _Islam: A Global Civilization_ These two short, glossy official publications give one a feel for how the Saudi governm ent wants the world to view Islam.

3\. Ramadan or other aspects of Muslim family life in America

Each year at Ramadan U.S. newspapers typically give a positive outsiders view
of this holiday. Use the Internet to find some recent examples of how the
press presents Islam as a part of U.S. culture.

4\. Muslims in prison

In the U.S. as a whole and in Colorado there are a number of Muslims in the
prison population. Have prisons had to change to accommodate the civil rights
of Muslims?

5\. U.S. attitudes toward Muslims during and after the war in Kosovo. Use
newspapers and news magazines.

6\. Anti-Muslim sentiment: The Islamic Center in Denver regularly receives
threats including bomb threats this past spring. How does the local press
cover such events? Do Denver Muslims feel unsafe?

7\. The Nation of Islam and/or African American Islam; one possible source:

"The Sun of Islam Will Rise in the West: Minister Farrakhan and the Nation of
Islam in the Latter Days," by Mattias Gardell, in _Muslim Communities in North
America_ _,_ Yvonne Haddad and Jane Smith, editors (1994).

8\. Your report could be on any ONE of the following personalities, events or
groups:

  
Ibn Battuta (the Arab Marco Polo)  
Rabi'a al-Adawiya (9th century woman Sufi mystic)  
Muhammad al-Ghazali (12th century Persian Sunni scholar)  
Ibn Khaldun (14th century Arab historian)  
the Ayatollah Kohmeini and the Iranian revolution  
Mohamed Arkoun (20th century Islamic theologian)  
The Islamic Brotherhood  
Sayyid Qutb (a founder of modern political Islam)

9\. Muslims in the U.S; one possible resource would be any one chapter from
_Muslim Communities in North America_ , Yvonne Haddad and Jane Smith, editors
(1994).

  
10\. Islam on the Internet. Please chose information from web sites with a
critical eye. Apply KISS criteria #3 (Who is talking about this issue; where
did I get my information and why do I think this is a reliable source? OR What
religious/political posit ion is being advocated here?). Some possibilities:
[www.cair-net.org](http://www.cair-net.org/), and its related page [www.cair-
net.org/alerts/98](http://www.cair-net.org/alerts/98),
[www.isna.net](http://www.isna.net/), < A HREF="http://www.islamic-
foundations.org/">www.islamic-foundation.org, etc.

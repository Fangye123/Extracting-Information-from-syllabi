**Hist 588-401 Social and Economic History  
David Ludden ----- T 3-6  
** This course concentrates on the intersection of social and economic
history, from which vantage point we explore history as a composite social
science (or inter-discipline), bringing together diverse theory, methods, and
data on meta-issues that preoccupy many disciplines. Our readings trace major
strands of social theory, identify the disciplines that constitute social
science history, and present case studies from various regions, from the
fourteenth century to the present. Our meta-issues concern modernity and
capitalism. Major topics include the location of theory; comparative
methodology; the relation of local sites, texts, and experience to broad
trends (including global history); culture and materialism; the value of the
nation as a container for research; and the interpretation of difference,
inequality, and power. the details of the syllabus will be determined in
consultation with students, to organize the course around their research
interests. Students write weekly response papers and a research oriented final
essay for discussion in class.

**608-401 Proseminar in Urban Studies  
Michael Katz ----- T 6-9  
** This seminar is required for students in the Urban Studies Graduate
Certificate Program. They will be given preference for enrollment, which is
limited to 15. The seminar extends over two semesters. In order to obtain
credit, students must enroll for both semesters. In the first semester, the
seminar will discuss a selection of recent interdisciplinary literature on
urban issues and introduce students to some of the Penn faculty concerned with
urban-related topics. In the second semester, students will write and present
a research paper.

**Hist 610-301 Violence and Aggression in America  
Michael Zuckerman ----- W 2-5  
** America was born in one war and reborn, as Lincoln said at Gettysburg, in
another. Our folk-heroes have, as often as not, been figures of lethal
aggression: Davy Crockett, Billy the Kid, John Dillinger, Bonny and Clyde, the
list goes on and on. Our favorite sports are our most violent, in which death
is nearest: football, auto racing. Our mass media are drenched in sadism and
inconceivable without it: comic books, movies, TV, music, and more. We have
long had the highest homicide rates in the so-called civilized world. And yet,
violence and aggression play remarkably minor parts in the stories that
historians have told America. In this class, we will try to repair a bit of
that neglect. There will be readings across the chronological span of American
history and an individualized research project on a topic of your own
devising. There will also be an agenda of my own that I ought to confess. I've
got to do a lecture in the Netherlands in May, for a friend's inauguration as
Professor of Psychology at the University of Utrecht, and he wants me to talk
about aggression in American history. As of now, I have not the foggiest
notion of what to talk about. You will help me to think through that lecture.

**Hist 610-401 Twentieth Century Afro-American Historiography  
Barbara Savage ----- W 11-2  
** This course focuses on recent works concerning the history of
AfricanAmericans during the period 1890 to the present. It is an intensive
readings course designed for students working in the field of African American
history as well as those from other fields or subfields or disciplines.

**Hist 620-301 A History of Cultural History: The Renaissance  
Ann Moyer ----- W 2-5  
** What is cultural history: a set of research methods? questions? topics?
interpretive assumptions? metanarratives? In this course, we will address
these questions through a historical approach. We will examine some of the
major writings of the early cultural historians of the nineteenth century,
chart the broad expansion of cultural history in the twentieth, and discuss
some of the implications for doing history in the century that lies before us.
We will devote particular attention to the central importance of the era of
the European Renaissance (and the history of early modern Europe) in the
development of cultural  
history. In that process we will survey a range of the interdisciplinary
themes, issues, and methods that have come to be known as cultural history,
and the ways in which fields such as history, literary studies, the history of
art, and anthropology have intersected over the years in the study of Europe
1300-1600. Authors will include: Burckhardt; Huizinga; Cassirer; Panofsky;
Gombrich; Yates; Geertz; Ginzburg; Foucault; Greenblatt. For more information,
please refer to the [syllabus for the course.](../hist620sp01/index.html)  
  
**Hist 620-401 Early Modern Cultural History: France, Spain and Italy  
R. Chartier ----- T 3-6  
** This seminar will examine the mroe recent historiographical reappraisals in
the field of cultural history. Devoted to the 16-18th centuries (with a
particular emphasis on France, Italy and Spain), it will pay a particular
attention to the objects and practices of written culture either manuscript or
print. It will focus on the different uses of writing, the circulation of
manuscript texts, the diverse modalities of the publication process,
intellectual techniques and reading practices. Such an approach will lead to
revise classical notions (for example, "popular culture" or "print
revolution"), traditional models of cultural diffusion, or inherited
oppositions (for example, between Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-
Reformation). The emphasis put on written culture will not be exclusive of a
reflection on other forms of communication: oral, visual, or corporal. The
materials read during the semianr will be either Early Modern texts, literary
or not, or historical works. The case studies discussed during the classes
will not be seperated from broader theoretical or methodological issues.

**Hist 620-402 Feminist Theories  
Farnsworth-Alvear/Brown ----- T 2-5  
** This course gives students the opportunity to engage with the most
significant theoretical influences upon feminist thought and historical
scholarship in the last 35 years. Foucault, Bourdieu, Rubin, Butler, and Freud
are just some of the theorists we will discuss. We will also incorporate
recent works in feminist film theory and queer theory. Our focus is twofold:
working collectively through difficult theory that is too daunting to tackle
alone, and exploring possible applications of feminist theory for feminist
politics and historical studies of women, gender and sexuality. Approximately
half of our course reading will be devoted to work designated as "theory" and
the other half to recent applications by historians.

**Hist 630-301 Historiography of world History  
Lynn Lees ----- R 1:30-4:30  
** Readings include classics of world history and recent studies of broad,
cross-cultural interactions in order to compare some of the ways in which
historians have defined world or global history. questions of periodization,
regional definition, mapping, and uits of analysis will be explored. The class
will also discuss different approaches tothe teaching of world history. As a
final assisgnment, students will create their own syllabi, probably as group
projects.

**Hist 700-301 Proseminar in History  
Thomas Childers ----- W 6-9

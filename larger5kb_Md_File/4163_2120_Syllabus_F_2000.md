**_SYLLABUS_** _While this syllabus is carefully planned, it may be modified
at any time in response to the needs and interests of the class, and it is
quite likely to be augmented with additional links of interest and further
details of daily class activities.   Such details as the grading criteria,
absence policy, etc., are _guaranteed not to change_.   You should have all
readings prepared exactly as described (i.e., completed before the class is
scheduled to discuss them), but you should also be ready to make careful note
of any schedule changes made in response to the needs and progress of the
group.  It is your responsibility to be prepared by checking the online
syllabus regularly and, should you have to miss a class, by calling one of
your colleagues to catch up on the discussion and to ascertain that no
schedule changes have been made in your absence._

>

> ## **Course Description:**

>

> Human Identity and Technology is the theme for Project Renaissance in Middle
Mohawk for 2000-2001. You will read novels, plays, poems, memoirs, and works
of history and social science. You will write essays and contribute to group
research projects. You will create a personal web page and act as a pen pal
and mentor to an elementary school student in Troy. A team of four faculty,
two each from the social sciences and the humanities, will guide your
learning. You will have the opportunity to meet graduation requirements and to
develop your intellectual and social capacities during your year in Project
Renaissance.

>

> ## **Graduation Requirements:**

>

> The four Project Renaissance courses you take this year will fulfill your 6
credit general education requirements in both humanities and social sciences.
You also will fulfill your lower level writing intensive course requirement in
the fall, and the requirements for oral discourse and information literacy in
the spring.

>

> ## **Intellectual Content:**

>

> We will focus on questions related to the meaning of progress, its relation
to self and community, and, in the spring, how technology influences and
shapes our understanding of self and community. The themes for this year will
allow us to examine the ways in which individuals and the social groups in
which we live change over time. We will explore how social and technological
forces affect change. We will ask if change is always the same as progress,
and will evaluate various ways of measuring material, social and moral
progress.

>

> ## **Academic and Personal Skills:**

>

> Project Renaissance is designed to develop your abilities to benefit from
and succeed in college. As we address intellectual issues, you will have the
chance to hone your skills in:

>

>   * Reflective thinking;

>   * Critical thinking;

>   * Analysis and synthesis of information and ideas;

>   * Understanding how academic disciplines differ in the types of knowledge
they seek to acquire, the ways in which knowledge is generated and evaluated.

>

>

> You also will develop your own abilities to:

>

>   * Take responsibility for your own education and behavior within a
university;

>   * Work with others in a group and resolve conflicts;

>   * Understand how higher education can contribute to your personal goads;

>   * Develop academic strategies that will allow you to met your goals;

>   * Develop a sense of self, and of your particular strengths and interests.

>

>

> ## **Course and Team Expectations:**

>

> You are expected to be a full participant in all aspects of these two linked
courses. Attendance at all classes is mandatory and it is vital if you are to
keep up with the readings and discussions and be prepared to carry out the
assignments of these courses.

>

> All assigned work must be given in on the dates due. No extensions for work
due or make-ups for in-class assignments will be granted except for dire
emergencies. All assigned readings should be completed in time for the class
in which they will be discussed. Teaching and learning in Project Renaissance
requires collaboration and sincere engagement with the materials and
activities of the two linked courses. All Project Renaissance instructors
expect that you will put effort into understanding the course material. We
will be able to accomplish out goals only if you read, write, discuss,
reflect, analyze, synthesize, critique, and then report your understandings in
class discussions as well as more formal presentations. Your involvement and
effort will allow all of us to avoid frustration and disappointment and will
yield grades that reflect the time and energy you put into these courses.

>

> ## **Standards of Conduct:**

>

>   * Bring the appropriate materials to class: books, notebooks, pens, or
pencils.

>   * Come to class on time and remain for the entire period, unless given
prior permission to leave early.

>   * Rules of common courtesy and civility will be respected: one person will
speak at a time, and no negative or disrespectful comments toward anyone will
be permitted.

>   * No disruptive electronic devices may be brought to class.

>   * Come to class properly dressed.

>   * Do not bring food to class, except for drinks.

>

>

> ## **Academic Dishonesty/Plagiarism:**

>

> We adhere to the University's policies and statements on appropriate
standards of behavior as set out in the Student Handbook. In particular, we
enforce regulations and penalties concerning academic dishonesty. Please see [

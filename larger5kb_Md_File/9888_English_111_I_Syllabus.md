COURSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES:

**

This is not a drama survey course, and it is not a computer course. It is a
course designed to help you develop your skills as a persuasive, academic
writer. The plays that we will read are the raw material from which you will
construct your arguments, and the computers are simply tools to help you edit
your work with increased efficiency and creativity. This course will provide a
setting where you will gain an understanding of the nature of argument, of the
way it is constructed in a specific context, and of the strategies that
writers use to advance the claim of their arguments. You will also be given
many, many chances to practice these strategies yourself. Ultimately, my hope
is that your writing will acquire an eloquence and clarity that will display
your intelligence to its best advantage. But you have a limited amount of time
here. If you learn to regard writing as a process that relies heavily on
revision and collaboration, as opposed to a miraculous product produced by
lucky people who just happen to write well, and can gain some confidence in
your strengths as a writer, I think you will have accomplished a great deal.

**

WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS:

**

During the quarter, you will complete three formal writing assignments which
you will revise extensively. Each assignment consists of three editions. The
first two editions are intended to help you move toward a revised, final
paper, and therefore, they should not be fragmentary sketches or outlines. You
must bring three copies of your second edition to class on the specified due
date. You will then exchange this draft with other students for peer responses
and turn in one copy to me for comments. Using our responses and feedback as a
guide, you will revise and turn in two copies of the final edition to me for a
grade. **All essays are due at the beginning of class** and must be typed in
standard 12-point font, double-spaced and stapled. A hard copy on disk must
also be brought in on the due date. Please note: no paper will be accepted for
a grade unless the previous two draft editions have been submitted first.

In addition to the three assignments, you will be asked to complete informal
in-class and homework assignments that will assist you in developing ideas and
strategies for writing your arguments.

You will complete a **final retrospective essay** at the end of the quarter.
This final essay will be based on your reflections of the reading and writing
that you have done in this course.

You will be an active participant in the classroom community. This entails
keeping up with the assigned readings, completing "informal" in-class writing
and class discussion sessions both on and off-line, writing thoughtful and
constructive reviews of your peers' papers, and coming to class each day
prepared to raise questions and share insights.

**

LATE PAPERS:

**

In fairness to your fellow class members, late papers cannot be awarded full
credit. I reserve the right to subtract 0.3 grade points for each day past the
due date (including weekends). Please be sure to give any late papers directly
to me to avoid confusion. Late homework assignments will be marked down one
point for each day they are late.

Please note:** These are the "formal" writing assignments. However, there will
also be other "informal" in-class and outside writing assignments, so it will
be important to follow the week-by-week schedule which will accompany each
assignment.

COURSE GRADING:

**

Your final grade for the course is broken down as follows:

Assignment One |

20% |

Final Essay |

10%  
---|---|---|---  
  
Assignment Two |

20% |

Participation (including peer critiques) |

25%  
  
Assignment Three |

20% |

First Editions |

5%  
  
Essays will be assessed using the "Five Criteria for Good College Writing,"
which we will discuss at a later date. Participation grades are divided evenly
between your contributions to class discussions/activities and your homework
assignments. I will collect and assign a grade from 1-4 on your discussion
questions, peer reviews, and reading responses, and do a numerical calculation
of these assignments at the end of the quarter. I will also keep track of your
contributions to the Bulletin Board discussions on Babel, so be sure to take
these seriously.

**

ATTENDANCE:

**

Daily attendance and prepared participation are essential for this class (and
for you) to be a success. **This is especially crucial since this class meets
only twice a week**. Please note that attendance falls under the Participation
section of your grade, and consequently, your grade will be affected by
absences. If you must miss class, please let me know ahead of time, but keep
in mind that in-class assignments (including peer critiques) cannot be made
up.

**

THE COMPUTER LAB (LAN):

**

Being in the LAN won't magically transform your writing or make the writing
itself effortless, but it will make it easier for you to do some things that
are crucial for improving as a writer. The ease of editing on a computer
screen and the possibilities for collaborative input at various stages of the
writing process facilitates the sort of global revision that produces good
writing. But you will need to put in enough time and effort to become
comfortable early in the quarter with the relatively basic computer skills
needed for this course. For some of you, this may involve very little work and
for others a bit more. You will also need to attend to the following technical
requirements:

  * You must have the editions of your essays for this class available by the deadlines in three formats: **1** on the computer network (for group work); **2** printed out on paper (in multiple copies for the .2 and .3 editions); **3** on a disk for back-up. 
  * We will be using Microsoft Word '97 as our word-processing program in the LAN. You may use Word on your computer at home or in any of the computer labs on campus. If, however, you choose to use any other word processing program, you will be responsible for learning how to convert your text into Word format **prior to any specific due date**. Be sure to consult the _Field Guide to the LAN_ or see me if you have questions regarding this. 

**

CONFERENCES AND OFFICE HOURS:

**

Each of you will be asked to meet with me individually, **by appointment** ,
at least twice during the quarter for one mandatory and one optional
conference. Of course, I encourage you to stop by my office during my
regularly scheduled office hours (or by appointment if you cannot make those
hours) for additional meeting time. E-mail communication is also heartily
encouraged and I check and respond to my mail daily.

**

POLICIES:

**

Please read the "General Policies" handout for information on Incompletes,
Drops, Grades, and Plagiarism. With respect to the latter: Plagiarism is
-quite simply- cheating and will not be tolerated. Once again, if you are
feeling pressured or confused about any assignment at any time during the
quarter, please come talk to me or send an e-mail.

**

DAILY ASSIGNMENTS

**

What follows is a sketch of the course. As the quarter goes along, I will hand
out more detailed descriptions of specific assignments, and I will make
changes to this syllabus. **Please bring this schedule to class every day-I
will refer to it often**.

ARTICLE 10, CALENDAR

The academic calendar shall serve the educational and workplace needs of the

Angeles Community College District. A myriad of factors contribute to
enrollment demands at each of the colleges. These factors include but are not

school calendars, customized articulation and transfer agreements with local
baccalaureate granting institutions and, increasingly, competition from
neighboring community colleges.

The AFT and the District agree that each college shall select an academic
calendar from a menu of calendar options that best serves the educational,
workplace and enrollment needs of its students, community and service area

ARTICLE 12, CLASS SIZE

A.Each department shall, as a goal, maintain an average class size of 34
students at the first census. In no way is this goal intended as a device for
calculations related to a reduction of class offerings. Class offerings are
determined by an array of data including but not limited to student demand,
articulation agreements, graduation requirements, facility limitations,
equipment limitations and others.

B.The average class size shall be reduced if:

1.State or Federal laws or regulations or accrediting agencies such as that
for Allied Health (or Nursing) restrict the teacher-student ratio for classes
offered by the department, or

2.The facilities of the department or number of work stations, or where
equipment, supervision or safety requirements restrict the size of the
classes, or

3.The Chancellor grants an exception based upon the recommendation of the
College President or his/her designee.

C.Departments exempted from the average class size under Section B.2. shall
have their new average class size approved by the College President in
consultation with the AFT Chapter Chair. This information shall be provided to
the AFT and the Office of Academic Affairs.

D.To ensure compliance with this Article, the President must take such steps
as are reasonable and consistent with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement.

E.The President or his/her designee, in consultation with the Department
Chair, shall establish class section enrollment limits in excess of the
average class size to ensure compliance with this Article and provide the
information to the Office of Academic Affairs.

F.Responsibility for canceling classes because of low enrollment or low
attendance shall rest with the Vice President of Academic Affairs or his or
her designee, after consultation with the Department Chair or the faculty
member involved, whenever reasonably possible. Except as provided in Section
G, the Vice President may cancel a class for low enrollment at any time before
the first class session if the number of students enrolled is fewer than
fifteen. Similarly, the Vice President may cancel the class for low attendance
at any time during the first two weeks of a standard academic semester (or the
first 10% of the term-length for a class scheduled for a period that is
shorter than a standard academic semester) if the number of students actually
attending is fewer than fifteen.

G.The Vice President of Academic Affairs or his or her designee may cancel an
"advanced class" for low enrollment at any time before the first class session
if the number of students enrolled is fewer than eight. Similarly, the Vice
President may cancel an "advanced class" for low attendance at any time during
the first two weeks of a standard academic semester (or the first 10% of the
term-length for a class scheduled for a period that is shorter than a standard
academic semester) if the number of students actually attending is fewer than
eight. The President, or his or her designee, and the AFT Chapter shall, after
consulting with the college Academic Senate, determine which classes are
"advanced classes" subject to this section.

H.Departments currently meeting or exceeding class size goals have the right
to schedule their own classes within reasonable parameters established by the
Vice President of Academic Affairs, or his or her designee, in consultation
with the Department Chair. (Examples of such parameters include, but are not
limited to, the need to strike an appropriate balance between day and evening
class offerings, and the need to coordinate schedules among departments, where
appropriate). Scheduling in departments not meeting class size goals shall be
done with the approval of the Vice President of Academic Affairs or his/her
designee.

ARTICLE 13, ASSIGNMENT

A.Assignment, Full-Time

1.Annual Assignment. The AFT and the District shall in good faith continue
exploration of the suitability and feasibility of providing the opportunity
for faculty on a volunteer basis to substitute an alternate twelve (12) week
summer assignment for either the Fall semester or Spring semester or some
alternate thereof. This exploration is conducted with the view that, if both
parties find conditions acceptable, equable, practicable, and legal for the

also be assigned hourly rate under Article 16 in assignments supplementing the
PACE program; this does not authorize staffing the basic full-time positions
in PACE at hourly rate. As a goal 20% of PACE classes each semester should be
taught by contract, regular or substitute faculty. Employees once hired as
contract employees in the PACE program are not eligible for reassignment
outside the PACE program without approval of the College President or his/her
designee. Assignments in a summer PACE program between the Spring semester and

assignment shall be paid at the hourly rate consistent with Article 29, as
described above.

PACE Directors shall be assigned as Instructor Special Assignment for a

committee which shall study the contractual issues involved in nontraditional
modes of instruction such as, but not limited to, ITV and other distance
learning, PACE, and travel study, including FTE, class size and class limits,
and possible decentralization of ITV.

service for the number of hours based upon the proportion that their
fractional assignment is to a full assignment.

C.Assignments, Hourly Rate

salary differential for office hours under this Article shall maintain a
schedule of office hours each week at a reasonable time for student
consultation. The faculty member shall inform his or her students of the time

members who are also monthly rate employees of the District. For 1999-2000,
the total amount of the differential shall be $9.09 for each class hour that
is a part of the faculty member's hourly rate assignment.]

D.Assignments, Conditions and/or Exceptions

1.The normal academic workday extends from 7 a.m. until 4 p.m., and the normal
academic workweek begins at 7 a.m. on Monday and ends at 4 p.m. on Friday of
any week of instruction during the regular academic year. Generally, the
District will assign contract and regular faculty members to a schedule of
classes or other scheduled duties that fall within the normal academic workday
and workweek, but the District retains the discretion to assign faculty to
other reasonable schedules necessary to meet the needs of the colleges and
their programs.

2.For purpose of assigning and scheduling teaching faculty, the week shall be
divided into workblocks consisting of the following twelve weekly periods:
five "day" workblocks beginning at 7 a.m. and ending at 5 p.m. Monday through
Friday; five "evening" workblocks beginning at 4 p.m. Monday through Friday;
one workblock on Saturday; and one workblock on Sunday. Assignments that
either begin or end within the overlapping period between 4 p.m. and 5 p.m.
each weekday shall not be associated with both the "day" and "evening"
workblocks, but rather with a single workblock: the "day" workblock if the
assignment began before 4 p.m., or the "evening" workblock if the assignment
ends after 5 p.m. Assignments that begin in the "day" workblock and end in the
"evening" workblock shall be associated with both the "day" and "evening"
workblocks only if the time elapsed between the beginning of the instructor's
earliest class on that day and the conclusion of the instructor's latest class
on that day exceeds seven hours.

3.If the District assigns a teaching faculty member to a schedule of classes
or other scheduled teaching duties that regularly requires the faculty member
to be on campus, or otherwise actively engaged in scheduled teaching duties,
during six or more workblocks per week, each hour assigned to the faculty
member in the workblocks designated by the Vice President or his or her
designee as being beyond the fifth workblock shall (except for hours that are
a part of an hourly rate assignment) be weighted by a factor of 1.5 for the
purposes of calculating the faculty member's load.

4.Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, no faculty member
shall, without his or her agreement, be assigned:

a.with a break of more than three hours in a given workblock unless the
reasons for such an assignment are provided to the faculty member in writing;
or

b.to a schedule that provides a gap of fewer than ten hours between the end of
an assignment on one day and the beginning of the next assignment on the
following day; or

c.to a schedule that requires the faculty member to be on campus, or otherwise
actively engaged in scheduled duties, during more than five days per week, or
(for teaching faculty) more than five workblocks per week. A faculty member
may request in writing an assignment in excess of five workblocks and agree to
waive his/her right to the additional load credit described in Section D3
above with the written concurrence of the AFT Chapter Chair.

5.Teaching Hours. Table A lists the hours of assigned teaching that each full-
time faculty member, except those assigned to teach instructional television,
or courses offered in an individual study mode, shall provide each week. The
teaching hours listed in Table A may be averaged over the life of this
Agreement but, except as provided in Article 39 (Load Banking), may never vary
by more than a total accumulated sum of five (5) hours. In the event that a
faculty member who has a teaching assignment to be averaged over the life of
the Agreement fails to have his/her load averaged, he/she may choose to be
paid at the hourly rate in effect at the conclusion of this Agreement, or upon
retirement or separation from service, or extend the averaging into the next
Agreement. In the event that a faculty member who has a teaching assignment to
be averaged over the life of this Agreement goes on leave, the substitute, if
any, may be assigned the teaching hours which would have been assigned to the
faculty member on leave.

Notwithstanding the above provisions limiting overload and underload, for an
instructor who has an overload equal to a portion of a class, the instructor
may elect to be paid at his/her hourly rate for that portion of a class
provided that the AFT campus chapter chair and the college president or
his/her designee agree to such overpayment. If agreement is reached to pay for
partial overload, said payment shall be exempt from the provisions of Article
16, Retention and Seniority, Hourly Rate, and the payment shall be made during
the pay period in which the partial class was taught. Such payment shall be
exempt from the percentage limitation provided in Article 13.C.

6.Contract Courses. All faculty members assigned in programs for which the
costs are fully or partially paid under contracts between the District and
another party shall be assigned and compensated in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement. Article 15, Summer Session Assignment, and
Article 16, Retention and Seniority, shall not apply to contract courses
except that if a regular employee or an employee on the hourly rate seniority
list is selected to teach a course, he/she shall be granted hourly rate
seniority. If an employee is assigned to a contract course at the hourly rate
which extends into the Summer Session for more than five (5) weeks or the
Summer Session portion is more than one half the time that such course occurs,
he/she shall be paid according to the Summer Salary Schedule, if he/she is a
regular employee.

Regular employees and employees on the hourly rate seniority list at a college
offering contract courses shall be given first consideration for assignment to
teach the course and, if qualified (including the specialized expertise
required to teach the course as determined by the appropriate department chair
and the contractee), shall be offered an assignment to teach the course
according to provisions of Article 16 and shall be given hourly rate seniority
credit according to provisions of Article 16.

If an individual has satisfactorily taught a contract course, he/she shall
have the right to continue teaching the course if it is offered again
regardless of where the course is taught.

The collective bargaining agreement shall not apply to contracts for military
education except for those individuals who gained contract (probationary) or
regular (permanent) status with the District prior to their military education
assignment.

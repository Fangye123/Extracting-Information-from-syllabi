Econometrics I  
Fall, 1999  

  
**Course Description**

     The purpose of this course is to develop the analytical skills used concurrently in the first year Ph.D. program in economics at Duke. The set of subjects to be covered includes probability, statistics, (some) numerical methods, and basic econometrics. Linear algebra is only briefly reviewed as admission to the Ph.D. program requires coursework in matrix algebra and multivariate calculus. The probability and statisticis sections cover the aspects of these topics most relevant for econometrics. The computer skills to be developed include operation of a UNIX Workstation and a working knowledge of MATLAB and related packages. The Department of Economics has the required equipment and packages for your use. 

**Prerequisites:**

     A working knowledge of linear algebra and multivariate calculus is required. Concerned students should consult with me prior to enrolling in the course if they feel that they might be inadequately prepared.

**Readings:**

     The readings are drawn from several texts. These are listed below. Only Greene is required. Two of the other texts - Gallant and Judd - are extremely useful, however, and should probably be purchased by students contemplating a dissertation requiring empirical work. Amemiya is also extremely useful, but it unfortunately unavailable from the publisher. These and the remaining texts are referenced in the course outline by author.

**Course Requirements:**

     Development of computer skills proceeds through a series of exercises that illustrate and apply the concepts developed in the other sections. These will be made available on this web site. There will also be a midterm and a final. The grade in the course will be based on the midterm (30%), the final (40%), and problem sets (30%). 

     Students are encouraged to work on the problem sets in groups, although each individual student will be required to return their own individual write-up of the solutions. Groups may not be more than 3 students. 

    The topics covered this semester are listed below. We may not have time to cover all the topics; those with a * will be the most likely to be skipped. Note also that while Greene is the primary reference for Section IV (and for all of next semester's course), much of the remaining material will rely on the other texts and on lecture notes.

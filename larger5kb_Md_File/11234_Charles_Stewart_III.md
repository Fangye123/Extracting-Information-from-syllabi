Professor of Political Science. Professor Stewart specializes in the fields of
American politics and behavior, political institutions, and research
methodology. His research and teaching interests have focused on congressional
politics and history, budgetary politics, the separation of powers, electoral
politics, and quantitative research methods. His research on the roots of the
congressional budgetary process has resulted in the book _Budget Reform
Politics: The Design of the Appropriations Process in the House, 1865-1921_
(Cambridge University Press, 1989). His research on budgetary politics,
congressional elections, the history of Congress, and the separation of powers
has also appeared in the _American Journal of Political Science_ , the
_Journal of Politics_ , _Legislative Studies Quarterly_ , _Studies in American
Political Development_ , and numerous edited volumes. Professor Stewart's
current research concentrates on three areas: the history and development of
congressional committees, the development of political careerism in the United
States, and the transformation of American national politics in the decades
following the Civil War. He recently completed a text about congressional
politics for W.W. Norton entitled _[Analyzing
Congress](http://www.wwnorton.com/college/polisci/stewart/)_ and is currently
working on a five-volume compilation for Congressional Quarterly Press about
the history of congressional committees.

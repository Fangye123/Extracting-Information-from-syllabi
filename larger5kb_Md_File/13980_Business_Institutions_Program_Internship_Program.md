**Program Courses**

     The minor program in business institutions requires the successful completion (as indicated by receipt of a grade of C- or above) of eight courses: three required core courses and five elective courses. 

The program director may approve courses given in a particular year as
substitutions for the elective courses when the syllabus demonstrates a
business institutions emphasis. In addition, the minor program in business
institutions will from time to time arrange senior linkage seminars and junior
tutorials. These will be announced in the program newsletter, in
advertisements in the Daily Northwestern, and the like.

Students are encouraged to take courses outside their major to fulfill the
requirements for the minor in business institutions. Students applying for the
minor in business institutions must present records showing a minimum of five
courses not double-counted in their majors or concentrations. In addition,
courses to be counted toward the minor may not be taken on the Pass/No Credit
option.

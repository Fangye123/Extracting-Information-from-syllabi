**Course Description and Objectives:  
** This course will provide an overview of South American politics and
political economy for students with an interest in South American politics. We
will begin with a general introduction to the actors and institutions which
have played an important role in South American politics over the 500 years of
South America's existence. We will follow this general introduction with a
study of the politics of the ten South American countries individually. In the
second half of the course, we will focus on four critical issue areas during
the last thirty years, and on the theoretical attempts to explain them in the
South American context: 1) relations with international actors; 2) democracy
and authoritarianism; 3) development, dependency, and debt; and 4) revolution
and rebellion. Throughout the course, we will balance a "top-down" view of
politics from the standpoint of governments and political institutions with a
"bottom-up" view of politics from the standpoint of the citizens of South
America and their political participation. Another continual theme will be to
locate meaningful similarities and differences among the countries of the
region, exploring the question: is there such a thing as "Latin American
politics?"

**Course Format and Requirements:**  
This course will be both a lecture and a discussion course. The first part of
the course will be primarily lecture-based, as we lay a common framework for
understanding past and current South American politics. The second half of the
course, on major themes and issues in South American politics, will mix a
lecture and discussion format. In addition to the common readings of the
second half, discussions here will also be based on student research.
Depending on student interests, the topics for the second half of the course
may be revised. A revised syllabus with daily readings and topics for the
second half of the course will be distributed later.

Your grade will be based on the following course requirements:  
* Midterm exam (25% of course grade) - March 13  
* Final exam - non-cumulative (25% of course grade) - May 9, 1:30-3:30  
* Research project (40% of course grade -- see below)  
* Attendance and reading quizzes (10% of course grade)  
Exams will include short-answer questions and essays, with a study guide a
week before.

The research project requires you to develop an expertise on an important
issue in South American politics. You will hand in the following pieces:  
* Paper topic statement with bibliography (5%) - due March 1  
* 15-20 page research paper (30%) - due April 19  
* Presentation of research paper results (5%) - April 26 to May 3

Assignments which are not completed will receive a score of 0. All requests
for make-up exams or missed deadlines require documentation and prior
permission, if at all possible.  
Throughout the course, you are expected to read the assigned chapters before
class. Your thoughtful preparation and participation are an important part of
this course. Five books have been ordered for this class and are available in
the campus bookstore and on reserve in the library. During the second half of
the semester, additional readings may be placed on reserve. The books for the
course are:

Transition L. America_  
Larry Diamond, et.al., Eds. _Democracy in Developing Countries: Latin America_  
Jonathan Hartlyn, et.al., Eds. _The United States and Latin America in the

**Paper Assignment #1**

|  |  |  
|  Select any South American country, and write a brief summary of that
country=s politics over the last 20 years. The total length of the paper
should be 3-4 typed, double-spaced pages. You should include a complete
bibliography of all sources used, and use footnotes where appropriate. Include
answers to the following "Intro to Comparative" questions:

1\. Does this country have significant social cleavages? Does it have any
unusual geographic features that affect its politics?  
2\. Would you label this country democratic? If so, what kind? If not, why
not?  
3\. Is there a large state role in the economy of this country?  
4\. How many political parties does it have? Are people able to freely
organize and express their political opinions?  
5\. Does this country have a presidential or a parliamentary system?

We will spend the entire class period on February 10 discussing these papers,
so late papers will not be accepted without a dire and documented excuse.
During the discussion, you should be prepared to share the results of your
research with the class.

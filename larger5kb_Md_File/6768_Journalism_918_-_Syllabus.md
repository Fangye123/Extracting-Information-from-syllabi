J918 is for graduate students who plan to work in the history of mass
communication. It is an intensive reading course designed to introduce
students to the important secondary literature in the field. As such, it
differs from J919 in which students write an original research paper based on
primary sources. Students who plan to take J919 should find J918 helpful.
Those who have already had J918 with Professor Baughman are welcome in this
course.

  
Readings and class discussions will be arranged topically. In the past, some
(but not all) of the themes considered in J918 have included:

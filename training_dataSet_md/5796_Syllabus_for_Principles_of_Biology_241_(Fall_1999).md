### Course Requirements:

To receive credit for this course, a student must:

  1. Demonstrate appropriate understanding of the course content as manifest in performance on the examinations and written assignments as detailed under Grading Policies. Course content will include the lecture by Richard Dawkins on October 12 beginning at 7 p.m.
  2. Regularly attend laboratory sessions and demonstrate understanding of the laboratory content as manifest in performance on the laboratory assignments as detailing under Grading Policies.

### Grading Policy for Principles of Biology 241 (Fall 1999)

#### Grades in this class will be determined on a non-competitive basis. It is
possible for every student to earn an "A" grade.

The instructor will add the scores earned on the best four (4) of the five (5)
hourly exams (50 x 4 = 200 possible points), the scores earned on the
semifinal and final exams (100 x 2 = 200 points), all of the lecture quiz and
other scores (up to 100 points) and the best 10 of the possible laboratory
scores (5 points attendence + 5 points performance for each lab) plus the two
lab exams (2 x 50 = 100 points). The instructor reserves the right to raise or
lower the grade of any student up to 25 points based on the students safety in
the lab, class participation, attendence, preparation or effort. Final grades
will be determined by evaluation of the total points earned by each student
according to the following schedule of grades.

  * Students earning 90% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "A". 
  * Students earning 80% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "B". 
  * Students earning 70% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "C". 
  * Students earning 60% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "D". 
  * Students earning less than 60% of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "F". 
Because only the best four of the five hourly exams will be counted, there
will be no makeup exams in this class. Because only the best 10 laboratories
will be counted, there will be no makeup laboratories. All students must take
the two lab exams and the semifinal and final exams to successfully complete
this class. There will be no makeup quizzes or assignments.  The semifinal
exam is scheduled for Monday the 25th of October at 10:00 a.m. and the final
exam will be given Wednesday, 15 December from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m.  
  
Cheating, whether seeking or giving inappropriate assistance during an exam,
quiz or other graded assignment will result in a score of "0" for both parties
involved. A second incident will result in a course grade of "F".

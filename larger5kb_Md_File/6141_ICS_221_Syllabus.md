#  Overview and Prerequisite Knowledge

From the UCI Catalog:

> Study of the concepts, methods, and tools for the analysis, design,
construction, and measurement of complex software-intensive systems.
Underlying principles emphasized. State-of-the-art software engineering and
promising research areas covered, including principles of software
engineering, requirements analysis, design, implementation, testing, and
project management.

This class is a graduate survey of software engineering topics. The
instructors assume basic background in software engineering as well as some
experience in developing software systems. For example, the course assumes
knowledge the following basic ideas: software engineering principles (such as
abstraction and information hiding), software development phases (e.g.,
requirements analysis, design, implementation), software development processes
(such as the waterfall and spiral models), software design methodologies (such
as object-oriented design), software testing and analysis strategies, and
project management issues (e.g., chief programmer teams). Students unfamiliar
with this area are advised to take ICS 121, as this course will not repeat
basic material, but rather will focus on issues at the frontier of software
engineering. At the end of the class, students should be knowledgeable about
what key problems are currently being pursued by software researchers and what
key approaches are being proposed and investigated, as well as be familiar
with the work of many of the leading software researchers.

The vehicles for learning about the topics are readings from the textbook,
readings from the technical literature, lectures, and classroom discussion.
The class is co-taught by the software faculty so that specialty topics may be
presented in depth.

#  Readings

Readings are assigned from the required textbook:

  * _[Fundamentals of Software Engineering](http://www.prenhall.com/013/820431/82043-1.html)_ , by [Carlo Ghezzi](http://www.elet.polimi.it/people/ghezzi/index.html), [Mehdi Jazayeri](http://www.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/Staff/mj/mehdi.html), and [Dino Mandrioli](http://www.elet.polimi.it/people/mandriol/index.html), 1991. Prentice-Hall.

Readings are also assigned to supplement the text as indicated (and these are
subject to change by the lecturers).  Most of these are from the [Software
Phase II Reading List](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~djr/classes/221/software-
reading.html).

#  Assignments and Assessment

  * Paper/topic summaries: in aggregate, ten topic briefs (due one week after the topic is discussed in class) account for 40% of your grade. For ten (10) topics discussed throughout the quarter and one or more papers assigned for each topic (out of about 16 topics and 15-20 papers) you are required to submit a two-page (appx. 800 word) summary and evaluation brief. The first page should summarize the key points or contributions of the paper(s). The second page should assess the applicability of the paper's ideas to the topic, problems in applying the ideas, remaining issues related to the topic, or provide other critical evaluation of the paper(s) or software topic.  For topics in which more than one paper is assigned, you may choose to discuss all papers assigned or focus on a single paper for that topic (but you may not write two separate briefs on one topic).  You may combine related topics (covered over more than one lecture) into a single area if you so choose.  If for a topic you chose there was no paper assignment, please discuss the lecture in detail.
  * Term paper/presentation: accounting for 30% of your grade. The term paper is an in-depth exploration of some current topic in software engineering. (The paper must be new for this class, not a revised paper written for some other ICS class.) This paper may be largely survey in nature. Substantial latitude will be allowed in choosing the topic, but all topics must be software-related and approved in advance by the instructor.  Each student will present (to the class) a 5 minute overview of their planned paper (during the 9th or 10th week of classes).
  * Class attendance and participation: accounts for 10% of your grade.  Class participation is critical and will share both your experiences and understanding of the class material.
  * Final exam: worth 20% of your grade. The final exam will ask you to demonstrate your understanding of the papers and topics covered in class as well as software issues in general.

101\. Race and Ethnicity

Fall 2001  
Instructor: Eric Porter

### Preliminary Syllabus

### Course Description:

This seminar is designed to introduce students to the study of race and
ethnicity in the United States. Students will receive a grounding in various
theoretical and methodological perspectives used to analyze race and
ethnicity, explore how scholars have used these perspectives to better
understand the historical experiences of different ethnic and racial groups,
and examine how issues of race and ethnicity inflect current social and
political debates.

### Organization:

#### Unit I (weeks 1-4): Theoretical Perspectives

We will begin by defining terms and follow this discussion with an overview of
various theoretical perspectives (sociology, feminism, Marxism, postcolonial
studies, critical race theory, etc.) that scholars use to understand race and
ethnicity.

**Readings:**

  * Les Back and John Solomos, _Theories of Race and Racism_
  * Selected articles from the course reader

#### Unit II (weeks 5-8): Disciplinary Approaches and Group Perspectives

The second part of the course explores how ethnic and racial categories and
relations have been consolidated, transformed, and contested in the contexts
of conquest, colonization, capitalist development, slavery, immigration,
politics, cultural production, etc. We will analyze books devoted to the
experiences of different racial and ethnic groups and, in doing so, consider
how various disciplinary approaches enhance the study of race and ethnicity.

**Readings:**

  * David Saldivar, _Walls and Mirrors_
  * Robin Kelley, _Race Rebels_
  * Lisa Lowe, _Immigrant Acts_
  * Gerald Vizenor, _The People Named the Chippewa_

#### Unit III (weeks 9 - 10): Contemporary Issues

We will conclude by applying the historical and theoretical perspectives we
have encountered to contemporary issues. Possible topics include multiracial

102A. Gender and U.S. Society

Instructor: Katie Gilmartin

### Please note: Information is from a previous quarter

### Course Description

This course will serve as an introduction to the gendered analysis of U.S.
society and culture from theoretical and historical perspectives. We will work
from the assumption that both women and men are gendered and will devote
particular attention to the ways in which gender intersects with race,
ethnicity, class, and sexuality. The course will begin with theoretical
perspectives on gender, on the role of gender in history, and on the
intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, and class. We will then examine the
gendering of work, with an emphasis on gendered work and social change during
World War II. Next we will explore gendered images and gendered violence. We
will then turn our focus to the complex relationship between gender and
sexuality. The course will conclude with a novel by a "gender outlaw" that
touches on each of the main topics of the course and underscores the variety
of ways in which gender is enforced in U.S. society.

You are responsible for all information contained in this syllabus. Please
read it over carefully and refer to it throughout the quarter.

#### Required Texts

These are available at Bay Tree Books:

  * Sherna Gluck, _Rosie the Riveter Revisited_
  * Leslie Feinberg, _Stone Butch Blues_

Also required is a Course Reader, available at the UCSC Copy Center. Be sure
to pick this up immediately; our first reading is an article in this reader.

### Course Requirements

1\. You are expected to attend class regularly, to read and think about each
of the assigned texts, and to participate actively in class discussions. This
class will be run as a seminar with much of our time devoted to discussing the
readings; class participation will therefore be an important part of your
grade/evaluation. If you will be forced to miss class due to illness, please
notify me beforehand. If you do miss a class, you are responsible for getting
notes, assignments, handouts, etc. from that day's class.

2\. Together with several other students, you will facilitate discussion of
the week's reading once over the course of the quarter. This will involve (1)
meeting together to formulate two questions for the class to discuss and
handing in these questions to me at the beginning of class, (2) writing these
questions on the board and introducing them to the class, and (3) leading
class discussions. Your discussion questions should focus on the readings. The
purpose of these questions is not to stump your fellow classmates, but rather
to facilitate scintillating conversations that clarify the texts we have read
for that day or week. Ask questions that interest you! You are not expected to
be able to provide the answers, but rather to get things rolling.

3\. You will write weekly response papers on the starred (*) readings. These
should be 1-2 pages, typed, and double-spaced. The purpose of these response
papers is to encourage active reading; it is a place for you to explore your
responses to the readings, to note important themes, to examine issues in the
readings that interest you. These should not merely be summaries of the week's
readings, but rather thoughtful explorations of some idea or issue in the
readings. I want to see you thinking. This exercise is also intended to
encourage more active and thoughtful participation in class discussions;
therefore, the journal entries must be handed in at the beginning of the class
on that particular text or texts (no exceptions). Your journals will not be
graded individually, but they are required, and will be an important part of
your overall grade/evaluation for the class. Seven response papers are
assigned during the quarter; you must successfully complete at least six of
these to pass this class.

4\. You will write a short paper (3-4 pages, typed, double-spaced), due April
18, examining the ways in which work in your family of origin was gendered. A
handout will describe this assignment in greater detail.

5\. You will write a longer paper (7-8 pages, typed, double-spaced), due on
the last day of class, analyzing the role of gender in an autobiography of
your choice. A handout will describe this assignment in greater detail and
suggest some autobiographies that you may wish to read.

6\. You are expected to bring in and discuss at least one item for "show and
tell." This assignment will be explained during the first week of class.

125A. Aspects of African American Culture

Fall 2001  
Instructor: Eric Porter

### Preliminary Syllabus

### Course Description:

This course explores three modes of African American cultural production
(music, film and literature) in their social and historical contexts. We will
examine the social conditions that influenced the production of these genres
at distinct historical moments and will analyze particular examples of each as
windows into aspects of African American life. We will also consider the
various strategies African American cultural workers have employed to
represent themselves and their people and situate these strategies in the
ongoing dialogue about culture in African-American intellectual and activist
circles. This course is also intended to introduce students to some of the key
questions and issues that drive the study of African American music, film, and
literature.

### Organization:

The course is divided into three sections, each of which focuses on a
particular historical period. Each section is designed to give students a
snapshot of the constantly evolving debates about African American culture and
to provide an opportunity to analyze specific examples of music, literature,
and film from the period in question.

**Course Description**  
This course offers a survey of women writers in modern Africa, focusing on the
special difficulties and special achievements of African women writers. The
course includes writers from a range of ethnic backgrounds, covering the
entire continent. We will be paying particular attention to the notion of
"double colonization"--i.e. the idea that African women suffered under both
colonial and local power structures--and looking at the ways in which African
women's writing might be seen as resisting that "double colonization." That
will involve us in discussions concerning the similarities and differences not
just between Africa and the West in general, but between the agenda of Western
feminists and women in Africa. Questions of tradition and modernity, orality
and literacy will drive much of the course. We will be studying a range of
imaginative texts--drama, novels, short stories, and poems; a number of
theoretical, critical, and informative essays; and various clips from feature
films and documentaries.

**Requirements**  
Each student will be expected to produce one 10-12 page term-paper, showing
evidence of having read no fewer than eight primary references, and following
MLA guidelines on structure, organization, and notation. About a month before
the end of term you are required to produce an outline of the term-paper with
a select bibliography. The outline does not bind you to the project (indeed I
may suggest substantial changes even if you remain happy with it) but will be
graded in its own right. You are also required to turn in three shorter papers
(one of which will be a summary of a critical essay) over the course of the
term, and there will be exams both mid-term and at the end of term (the former
very brief, the latter involving both short response and essay-style answers).
You will also receive a grade for class participation (which must include at
least one contribution to an e-mail discussion list which I will establish for
us to share questions and comments outside class time).

**Grading:**  
Short papers and term-paper outline:                    c.20% (60 points)  
Mid-term exam:                                                    c.10% (30

Final exam:                                                            c. 30%

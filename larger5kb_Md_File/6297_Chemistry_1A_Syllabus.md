Welcome to Chemistry 1A for the fall of 1995. The course will cover the basic
principles of chemistry. Topics this semester will include stoichiometry,
gases, kinetic theory, periodic table, bonding, phase transitions,
equilibrium, acid-base chemistry, solubility, thermodynamics,
electrochemistry, quantum mechanics, atomic structure, and nuclear chemistry.
Reading assignments from the text are an essential part of the course; they
should be undertaken in a serious and timely manner.

### COURSE REQUIREMENTS

#### Lecture

  * All course lectures in 1 Pimentel 
    * Monday and Wednesday 9-10 
    * Monday and Wednesday 11-12 
    * Tuesday and Thursday 11-12 (Video Lecture/Professor Head-Gordon) 
  * Weekly review lecture given every week by Barbara Reisner in 100 Lewis. This lecture will serve as a review of material covered the previous week in lecture with an empahsis on problem solving. 
    * Monday 6-7  

#### Laboratory

  * ATTENDANCE at the first three laboratory sessions is MANDATORY! Failure to attend will result in your being dropped from this course. 
  * Appropriate lab attire, discussed in the lab manual, is required. 
  * Safety glasses are required in lab at all times. These will be provided in your lab locker. 

#### Laboratory Reports

  * Laboratory reports are due four times during the semester. Details about these reports are in the lab manual or will be provided by your TA. 

#### Discussions

  * Discussion sections meet every Friday and attendance is mandatory. 
  * Discussion material will complement lecture material in an interactive environment. 

#### Reading

  * Readings will be taken from ONF (the textbook) and they will be assigned during Friday discussions. Be sure to do the assigned readings before coming to lecture. 
  * The reading assignment through September 8 is: 
    
        Medium Rare (A light perusal of the material):		
    		1-80, 152-179
    Well Done (A serious, in-depth reading and re-reading):	
    		8-28, 37-48, 166-179
    

#### Homework

  * Problem sets will be assigned and collected during Friday discussion. It is not unusual that problems identical or similar to those assigned for homework will appear in the exams 
  * The first problem set, due September 8 is: 
    
        	Ch. 1:	22, 46, 56

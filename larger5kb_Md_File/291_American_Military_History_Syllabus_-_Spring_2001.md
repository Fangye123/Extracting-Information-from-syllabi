**Course Objectives**  
This course is a survey of American military history from colonial times to
the present. Because it is a survey course, we will not have the opportunity
to give as much attention as you may desire to every important, interesting,
and controversial topic. However, we will discuss a wide range of issues about
which you will be expected to think and form your own opinions. Military
history is about more than generals and battles (what some historians like to
call  "Guns and Drums History"). We will spend much of our time discussing
things like technology, professionalism, administration, and military policy
-- the less glamorous but equally important components of a balanced overview
of military history. Rote memorization will do you little good in this class;
be prepared to think for yourselves, especially when it comes to the outside
readings. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the instructor's office
hours throughout the semester.

**Course Requirements - Undergraduates**  
The instructor expects each student to keep up with the schedule of readings
that appears on this syllabus. You will have a much better idea of what's
going on if you have done the reading. These assignments, along with
information from the lectures and discussions, will provide the material for
the exams. There are 375 possible points to be earned in this class. There
will be three (3) essay/ID exams. Each exam will be worth 100 points. You will
also write three precis worth 25 points each, which are explained in more
detail below. Your course grade is determined by your average and is based on
a standard 10-point scale.

**THERE WILL BE NO CURVE.**

**Course Requirements - Graduate Students**  
Graduate students will meet the same requirements as the undergraduates. In
addition, they will write several outside reviews of additional books and
write a 15-25 page historiographical essay on the topic of their choice.
Topics must be cleared with the instructor by January 30th. A preliminary
bibliography of the sources you expect to use is due on February 15th. Final
papers will be turned in at the final exam. The paper is worth 175 points.
Choosing a topic on time earns you 10 points and your preliminary bibliography
is worth up to 15 points. The remaining 150 points are reserved for the paper
itself. Papers will be docked one letter grade for every day they are late. If
necessary, I will provide you with a sample historiographic paper to give you
an idea of what is expected.

**Makeups**  
Makeups must be taken within two weeks of a missed exam and will only be given
if the student has a university-approved absence. **It is your responsibility
to arrange the makeup**. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, makeups
not completed within two weeks will have a score of zero entered on the
gradesheet. Students with unexcused absences will not be allowed to take a
makeup.

**Precis**  
A precis is a concise summary of the thesis and essential facts of a book or
other text. It is **not** a review. Your precis will be not less than two nor
greater that three pages in length, double-spaced and typed with standard
margins and in a standard 12 point font. You will be graded on both content
and style. Each precis is due at the beginning of class. Later papers will be
docked 5 points (20%).

Precis on Griffith's _Battle Tactics of the Civil War_ is due February 5th.  
Precis on Linn's _Guardians of Empire_ is due March 21st.  
Precis on Sorley's _A Better War_ is due April 27th.

**Writing Identification Exam Questions**  
On identifications, keep three things in mind. First, identify the person,
place or thing so that I know that you know what it was. Next, put the item in
historical context so that your understanding of its place in history is
apparent. And finally, if possible, demonstrate that you understand why the
item was significant. Why did I ask you about it? What was its historical
contribution?

**Writing Essay Exam Questions**  
When writing essays, it is important that you build your answer around some
kind of thesis statement. Be blunt and put your thesis in the opening
paragraph. The remaining paragraphs should strengthen your thesis while
answering the question. I often write essay questions that ask you to explain
different aspects of a basic question. You may find it easiest to make each of
these aspects the subject of its own paragraph. Be sure to support your essay
throughout with details from lectures and your readings. Make it **crystal
clear** to me that you understand the material. Finally, include a strong
conclusion where you tell me what you just told me in the rest of the essay.

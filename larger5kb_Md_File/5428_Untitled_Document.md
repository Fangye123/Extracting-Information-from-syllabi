**_Other handouts provided by the instructor_**

**_Standardized Test File_** : Students will be involved in actual test
selection, administration, scoring, and interpretation, and they will critique
the construction and validation of two published instruments. The Department
of Counseling and Student Development maintains a collection of standardized
instruments for student use. The collection is currently housed in the
Department Library, Room 2116, Buzzard Hall. You are welcome to brouse through
the files during my office hours, or by appointment with my graduate
assistant, [Kerry Cahill](mailto:cgkec@pen.eiu.edu).

**_Mathematics review_** : Those wishing additional help to review statistical
concepts are encouraged to read one of the following books:

Amos, J.R., Brown, F. L., & Mink, O. G. (1965). **Statistical concepts: A
basic program.** New York: Harper and Row.

Rowntree, D. (1981). **Statistics without tears**. New York: Charles
Scribner's Sons.

There is also some excellent self-help materials on the CD which accompanies
your textbook.  The Computerized Testing Tutorial for Students has some
excellent exercises for individuals at almost all levels of development in
measurement.  Work through the section starting on page 407 to install the
tutor on your computer.

There are also a number of Internet sites which provide measurement tutorials.
As I have time, I will add links to them on this page.  


**_Primary Learning Model_**

The lecture method (information processing) will be used when applicable, but
much of the work of the course will be concerned with actual study of testing
instruments themselves. Students will administer, score, and interpret results
of tests and other measuring instruments, and do any necessary statistical
work associated with interpretation. Students will be asked to share the
results of their test reviews with each other in small groups. Thus, hands-on
experience via realistic simulations and some group work will also be a
feature of the course.

Measurement Applied to Guidance is intended to give the candidate in
counseling and student development a clear understanding of the use and
suitability of measurement instruments. Since a large proportion of the
professional counselor's time is devoted to gathering information, skills in
this area are of vital importance. The work of this course is intended to
probe in some detail the purposes of testing instruments, and to give the
counselor a clear understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the
standardized instruments commonly used in agency and educational settings.

Boston: Allyn & Bacon.

Figure 1: Conceptual Framework:      Advanced Level (Adopted)

In accordance with the Primary Learning Model: Ecological (Joyce, et. al.,
1992), the specialized educational roles of curriculum specialist, master
teacher, counselor, and administrator are defined and driven by 81 specific
objectives for advanced programs. The objectives build upon the Knowledge and
Outcomes for the Basic Programs.

**_Special Needs :_**

If you have a documented disability and wish to discuss academic
accomodations, please contact the instructor as soon as possible.  


**_Marking_**  
Final marks in the course will be determined as follows. All raw scores will
be converted to linear T-scores and weighted in the proportions below to give
each person a total weighted T-score. The grade of "A" will be assigned to
T-scores of 55 and above, the grade of "B" will be assigned to T-scores from
45 to 54.99. The grade of "C" will be assigned to T-scores from 35 to 44.99,
and T-scores less than 35 will be assigned a "D".   If you are unfamiliar with
the computation of T-scores, refer to Drummond, page 99.

**Test Administration and Interpretation No. 2          12%**  
**Mid-term Examination                                               26%**

Submitting organized, completed work promptly is imporant. What you do in
class is the only sample of the kind of on-the-job performance you will be
likely to do in a professional position that I have available for me to
observe. Students who initially take an Incomplete mark for the course can
expect to earn no higher than a "B" (special, extenuating circumstances do
apply, such as death in the family), and they will typically earn a "C" (lack
of organization is often the major problem).  


**_Special Ordering Tests for Review:_**

As stated above, specimen tests and manuals for many common standardized
instruments used in school and agency counseling programs are available for
student use in the Department Library, 2116 Buzzard Hall. Students wishing to
order commercial assessment instruments from the publisher are encouraged to
do so at their own expense. I will co-sign the test user forms (found in the
back of each publisher's catalog) as your supervisor.  Test User Forms are
meant to prevent the unscrupulous use of standardized testing instrument.
Test publisher catalogs useful in determining current prices are also
available in the EDG test file cabinets, and should be consulted for the
latest price when the test evaluation assignment (Item II.9.a. of the Test
Review Form) is completed. Students wishing to review a specific test
instrument should immediately check the Department Test File Catalog to
determine if the instrument is available in the Test File for review. If it is
not, and you wish to order a specimen set for your review, speak with the
instructor and make the arrangements described above _early in the course_ to
allow sufficient time for materials to arrive (six weeks).  


**_Free Materials_**

School counseling students are encouraged to write the Illinois State Board of
Education, 100 North First Street, Springfield, Illinois, 62777, for the
following publications which are advertised as available on a no cost basis to
you. You are much more likely to receive the materials if you can request them
on your public school's letterhead.

1\. Bias Issues in Test Development.

2\. Assessment Handbook: A guide for assessing Illinois' Students.

**_Laboratory Fee_**

EDG 5720, Measurement in Guidance, is a laboratory course in which the "lab
materials" are the standardized tests which students consume as they are
critically evaluated, administered, and interpreted. As a consequence, there
is a $12.50 laboratory fee charged to each student for the cost of the
standardized testing materials used in the course. This money is then used to
resupply the test file for future classes. You will receive a bill from the
university. A mark will not be assigned unless the fee is paid.

**Test Review and Interpretation No. 1:** By this time, you should have

reception desk to videotape your test interpretation. Limited hours for EDG

in the lab when other instuctors are in charge of it if you first check with
the instructor. You may use a "client" of your choice, or a fellow student in
the class. Be certain to plan for an appointment with your instructor to view
the videotape together with him. This also requires use of lab time.

**Course Description**

Agribusiness & Biotechnology Law introduces legal principles ("gems")
applicable to a broad array of everyday legal issues facing agribusiness in
Missouri and throughout the U.S.A.

These principles derive from federal and state constitutions, statutes,
regulations, and court made (common) law. Special emphasis is placed on the
hierarchy of legal authority, as overlapping jurisdiction often results in a
"conflict of laws."

The topics to be covered include judicial process, sources of law, torts,
product liability, employer liability, environmental torts, contracts,
equitable doctrines, statute of limitations, remedies for breach of contract,
warranties, sales of farm products under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), ag
production contracts, regulation of grain/livestock dealers, corporations,
partnerships, limited liability companies, new generation cooperatives,
corporate farming restrictions, zoning/nuisance/right-to-farm laws, ag
financing under UCC Article 9 (security interests in personal property), land
financing (mortgages/deeds of trust/contracts for deed), labor laws (right-to-
work states, minimum wage, workers' comp, tax withholding, migrant/alien
labor, and unemployment comp), intellectual property (patents, copyrights,
trademarks), securities registration, global and ethical issues facing
agribusiness.

Our ultimate objective is to improve our critical thinking ability as we
analyze rural/agricultural happenings or business transactions for potential
legal pitfalls. We seek to become more proactive by identifying practical and
effective strategies to reduce our risk exposure to such problems. While you
will not acquire the legal skills of an attorney, the knowledge and thinking
skills in Agribusiness and Biotechnology Law this semester should
significantly improve your chances of avoiding legal disputes and of getting
timely legal advice.

**_Civility In and Outside the Classroom_**

Our classroom is really a very special place when you think about it.  We come
to learn together by opening ourselves to new ideas, to new ways of thinking,
and to diverse viewpoints.   We express ourselves differently, and sometimes
we fail to do our share of listening and tolerating different viewpoints and
ways of expression.

Let's try in and outside of our classroom to be respectful of each other.
Nonverbal communication like "looks" and body posture are just as important as
spoken words to convey our respect, or its lack.

Each of us has feelings and emotions, as well as unique personalities.  Let's
do our very best to be tolerant and respectful of others.

**Arrive before class starts (11:00am), leave when the class is over
(12:15pm).   It is distracting and disrespectful to everyone if you come in
late or depart early.**

Make honest and sincere efforts each class to be friendly and cheerful,
supportive and sharing.   Let's try really hard to treat others in and outside
our classroom just like we would want to be treated, OK?

____________________________________________________________

**Academic Honesty**

Academic honesty is fundamental to the activities and principles of a
university.  The University of Missouri has specific academic dishonesty
administrative procedures (refer to the rules & regulations in the M-Book).

In cases of academic dishonesty, the instructor may award a failing grade for
the assignment or a failing grade for the course, or may adjust the grade as
deemed appropriate. The instructor also may require the student to repeat the
assignment or to perform additional assignments. In addition to the
instructor's disciplinary action, cases of academic dishonesty will be
reported to the Office of the Provost for possible action.

____________________________________________________________

**Americans with Disabilities**

If you have special needs as addressed by the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) and need assistance, please notify the instructor immediately.
Reasonable effort will be made to accommodate your special needs.

If you need accommodations because of a disability,  please see me privately
after class, or at my office.

Office location: 210 Mumford Hall      Office phone:  882-0152

If you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need
special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please inform me
immediately.

To request academic accommodations (for example, a note taker), students must
also register with Disability Services, AO38 Brady Commons, 882-4696.   It is
the campus office responsible for reviewing documentation provided by students
requesting academic accommodations, and for accommodations planning in
cooperation with students and instructors, as needed and consistent with
course requirements.  

Another resource, MU's Adaptive Computing Technology Center, 884-2828, is
available to provide computing assistance to students with disabilities.   For
more information about the rights of people with disabilities, please see
ada.missouri.edu or call 884-7278.

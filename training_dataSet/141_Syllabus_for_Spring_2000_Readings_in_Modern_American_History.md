Thinking About Your Oral Presentation

* * *

**Course Description**

This seminar is intended to introduce you to some of the major issues \-
methodological and interpretative - in the historiography of the United States
in the twentieth century. The course is organized chronologically and
topically. The assigned readings, which offer a sampling of social, political,
cultural, and intellectual history, should familiarize you with some of the
most important recent scholarship on the various topics under discussion.
Although the reading list is inherently selective, I have tried to ensure that
diverse methodological perspectives, including gender and class analysis, will
be incorporated into each week's discussion.

By no means are the course readings exhaustive. But, after completing the
course readings and listening to your classmates' presentations, you should be
familiar with a substantial cross-section of the historiography of the
twentieth century. Moreover, you should have a foundation upon which to build
when conducting future research or preparing for your qualifying exams.

**THINKING ABOUT YOUR ORAL PRESENTATION**

Planning your oral presentation is important. You need to think about how you
will use the time you have available to present your material in an efficient
and interesting manner. You have almost unlimited opportunities for creativity
in planning your presentation - aside from meeting a few common sense
standards for decorum, you can present material in any reasonable fashion. You
may integrate any audio-visual resources that are feasible into your
presentation. (Just alert me as to your equipment requirements before hand.)
The following suggestions are intended to help you think creatively about your
presentation.

Questions to keep in mind when planning your presentation:

  1. Which oral presentations have I heard and liked in the past? Can I duplicate some of the  characteristics that I liked in those presentations? Which presentations did I dislike? How can I avoid replicating those presentations?
  2. What are the most important themes that I want the class to remember after listening to my    talk? Can I summarize those themes in a few short sentences? 
  3. How can I best organize my talk to highlight those themes? Should I organize it  thematically? Chronologically?
  4. Are there common themes shared by my presentation and the class readings? How can I best draw attention to those themes?
  5. Would visual aids add to my presentation? If yes, how can I incorporate them into my  presentation? Remember that visual aids should be used only if they add to the presentation; they should not "replace" it.
  6. How can I most effectively present my material? What techniques can I use to avoid reading the presentation? How can I maintain eye contact with my audience? How can I deliver a structured presentation which still retains a measure of spontaneity?

Important points to consider:

  1. Tell your audience why the specific information you are presenting is important. Also help the class understand the importance of your larger topic.
  2. Do more than simply summarize your material. You should provide a concise summary of the major points, but also concentrate on explaining the larger significance of those points.
  3. Strive for clarity. Your audience is likely to be more interested in the important themes than in details of your topic. Your audience can ask you for more detail after your presentation. So strive to present just enough detail to prevent your presentation from being overly abstract and general but not so much that your audience is overwhelmed by seemingly arcane information.
  4. Make sure that you provide a clear and cogent introduction and conclusion during your presentation. Often, the most effective introduction alerts the audience to the largest themes and the importance of the topic under discussion. Similarly, an effective conclusion reminds audiences of the important themes and connects them to the themes of the day's class.
  5. Concentrate on speaking to your audience. Think of how to hold their interest and how to encourage questions at the end of your presentation.Practice delivering your presentation before class. You may be surprised by how little you can actually say in 20 minutes. Above all, make sure that you can complete your talk in 20 minutes. An overly long presentation will tax the attention and patience of your audience.

Your grade on your presentation will be based on the following qualities:  
1) Clarity and organization -- how well organized your presentation is.  
2) Presentation style -- how effectively you present, in an interesting
manner, your material  
3) Analytical content -- how effectively you summarize the content, highlight
the important themes, and draw attention to the larger significance of your
material.

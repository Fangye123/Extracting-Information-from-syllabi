>> ### DESCRIPTION

>>

>> This course traces and examines the social, economic, and political
organization and representation of the U.S.-Mexico Borderlands. We will trace
an analytical trajectory from conflict and constestation to cooperation and
integration among border actors, keeping in mind that while conflict
characterizes the history of the interactions among border actors since the
17th century, the growing social interdependence and economic integration of
border life in the 20th century will also need to be analyzed and theorized.
Focusing on the cultural and social formations of Anglo-Americans, Native
Americans, and Mexican Americans in a dynamic contact zone, this course also
explores the continuities and discontinuities in popular and academic
representations of the border experience from the disciplinary perspectives of
Latin American Studies, History, Geography, Sociology, Urban Studies, and
Political Science. Our analysis of the border phenomenon and experience will
include a study of the public policy, ethnohistory, literary productions, and
filmic responses of diverse cultures in transition.

conversations with European Americans, Mexican Americans, and Asian Americans
one tries to sketch the characteristics of this particular nation in North
America.

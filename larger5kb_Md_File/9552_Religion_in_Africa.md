African Art, On and Off the Walls  
<http://community.middlebury.edu/~atherton/AR325.html>

animates most of the art objects included in this exhibition of works from
sub-Saharan Africa. The works have been collected over the past twenty-two
years by Charles Derby, who has long been interested in the art of tribal
peoples. In the homes or communal spaces of the peoples who created them,
these objects served as intermediaries between the visible, practical world in
which their users lived and the invisible, spiritual one to which they
addressed their aspirations, hopes, awe, and dread." This is an online exhibit
at Middlebury College.

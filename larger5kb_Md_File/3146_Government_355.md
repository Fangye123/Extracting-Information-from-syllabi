COURSE DESCRIPTION** (as it appears in the catalog)

This course is an overview of factors that influence political participation
in a polity. Emphasis is placed on applying the scientific method to the study
of public opinion and attitudes as well as voting behavior in the United
States.

READINGS

**

Two textbooks are required, two are recommended, and four additional texts
will be used for take home essays and in-class assignments. You are to
purchase the two required texts at the campus bookstore, while the two
recommended texts are optional purchases for supplemental reading; the
recommended texts will often clarify and/or expand upon the definitions of the
required texts. The four additional texts will contribute chapters that will
be provided by the instructor; these chapters will serve as the basis for
writing assignments that will be described later in more detail. You do not
need to purchase the four additional texts.

COURSE OBJECTIVES

**

For successful completion of Political Science 355, the student should have

1. demonstrated proficiency in organizing and developing the formal behavioral analysis approach;

2. increased knowledge of the basic concepts and theories used in the study of political behavior; and

3. increased skills in the basic research techniques employed in studying political behavior



**

TEACHING MODES

**

This class will be taught using a combination of lecture-discussion-
application and in-class participation. This major strategy will be
supplemented by

1\.  out-of-class assignments

2. independent reading and writing assignments

3. library and/or Internet assignments, and

4. writing and/or reading referrals



**

Andragogical and Pedagogical Style

**

This course will involve lectures on my part and note-taking on your part;
however, we will mostly let the readings do the lecturing so we can use our
class time doing, thinking, creating, rejecting, building, etc. This means we
will need real-world data in front of us to work on, think about, analyze,
organize, etc. I will provide many data sources for us to practice on.



**

REQUIREMENTS

**

Evaluations of Students

There are 1000 points possible in this class. Your performance and subsequent
grade will be determined by adding the points received from

1. **take-home essays

**

There will be two take-home essays involving each of the two required texts.

Each is worth 50 points and is to be completed individually. They are to be
typed, double spaced, and accompanied by a hand-written outline and/or rough
draft. The total points for take home essays will be 100 points and will
constitute 10% of your grade.

2. **independent reading/writing assignments

**

There will be two in-class reading/writing assignments taken from two of the
additional texts listed earlier, in comparison to the relevant readings in the
required texts. Each is worth 50 points and is to be completed in groups (to
be determined). They are to be hand-written and turned in at the end of class.
The total points for independent reading/writing assignments will be 100
points and will constitute 10% of your grade.

3. **library assignments/Internet

**

You will conduct one study of voting behavior in a foreign country (a
different country for each student). You will utilize the library's resources,
including the Internet. You cannot just use the Internet and your Internet use
does not have to be in the library, but your additional sources must be
library resources; i.e., additional books, journal articles, periodicals,
microfilm, etc. Your use of all sources, including the Internet, must be
meticulously accounted for in your bibliography. The library/Internet
assignment is worth 50 points and will constitute 5% of your grade.

4. **in-class projects and attendance

**

I will be bringing in selected newspaper/journal articles for class analysis
as well as taking the class to the Internet lab on occasion; there will be
five short projects worth 10 points each that will be completed over the
course of the semester. You must be here for these projects or you will lose
the points. You will not know in advance which days the projects will be
undertaken, so it is imperative that you attend class regularly. The total
points earned from in-class projects and attendance will be 50 points and will
constitute 5% of your grade.

5. **major research paper

**

You are responsible for a 15-20-page typed, double-spaced research paper that
will involve a minimum of 5 non-Internet resources. Use the recommended
reading list specified at the beginning of the syllabus as well as the
bibliography listed at the end. Your research must also include **field**
research; you must **go out into the field** of voting behavior by visiting a
relevant institution, governmental agency, office, department, association,
interest group, lobbying firm, etc. for current, raw data on which to base
your paper's thesis and conclusions. Start planning this now; don't wait until
the last minute. The paper is worth 300 points; it is the largest single
source of points in this course and is taken very seriously in regard to your
final grade. Your paper's topic and thesis must be chosen by the day the
midterm is given or you will accrue 25 penalty points for each week
thereafter. The paper itself is due the 14th week of class, two weeks before
the final exam. Rough drafts may be turned in for prior evaluation; they also
must be typed and double-spaced and include a bibliography. Be careful about
how you choose to list your sources throughout the paper; use either endnotes
or footnotes. Consult the **_Little Brown Reader**_ in the library or any
bookstore for proper citation techniques. The research paper will constitute
30% of your grade, and the points earned for the paper will be broken down as
follows:

1. THESIS--a significant, logical and clear, central idea: 10%

2. ORGANIZATION--clear and coherent: 10%

3. DEVELOPMENT--adequate and logical: 30%

4\.  EFFECTIVENESS--conciseness, logic, sentence variation, parallelism: 20%

5. MECHANICS--grammar, usage: 30%

5. **mid-term exam

**

A mid-term exam will be given after the eighth week of class on all chapters
through that period in both required texts, lecture material, and any take-
home or in-class assignments completed by that date. It is worth 200 points
and will constitute 20% of your grade.

6. **mid-term exam

**

The final exam will be given during normal class time after the 16th week of
class, will cover all material since the midterm, from the required texts and
lectures, as well as any take-home or in-class assignments completed since the
midterm. It is also worth 200 points and will constitute the remaining 20% of
your grade.

**Extra Credit**

**

The point system is flexible in that you have the opportunity to add to your
point total by doing extra credit. Look for events that you can attend,
preferably free of charge, in your community or anywhere in the greater
Maryland-Washington-northern Virginia area. Events that qualify include
anything politically related such as lectures, government meetings (any
level), citizen hearings, campaign rallies or other events, special exhibits,
promotions by an author of a book with political implications, cultural
celebrations that include speaking time, etc. Such events are posted in local
and neighborhood newspapers, on campus bulletin boards throughout the region,
at community centers, at bookstores, at libraries, even on the Internet. By
attending a political event, you may earn five points an hour, up to 40 points
maximum, which would mean 8 hours or more of your physical presence at the
event. Although the total number of points you can earn is unlimited, I do ask
that you not spend eight hours per event. In other words, you can earn 40
points once; after that, all events must be four hours or less. This is so you
participate in short, concentrated activities rather than spend an entire
weekend at a conference and consider every moment

you spend there as extra credit time. I don't want you attending entire
conferences or taking bus trips; I want you participating in multiple but
brief experiences that are educational.

All activities require prior approval, so check with me first. Don't wait
until the last minute--put points in the bank! If you are 5 points short of
the next grade after the final, it will be too late. Get your extra credit
points while you can. You must hand write a 1-page summary for the event and
attach a flier or some other evidence of attendance.

The key to this course is participation; participation in class, on campus,
and in the community. Real Life is the best teacher of all. The more active
you are, the more you will learn, and the more you will enjoy learning it. Who
knows, you might just experience something that will inspire you to choose a
new career.

**

Extra Credit Rules

**

1\. Every event you attend must be brought to me in advance and agreed to
beforehand between you and I.

2\. The number of hours attended and the total points you will earn must be
agreed to beforehand.

3\. The type of evidence you will furnish along with your written summary as
proof of attendance must be agreed to beforehand, and it cannot consist of
more than one document.

4\. You must use the extra credit sheet provided in your syllabus for every
event you attend. Make multiple copies of the one provided in the syllabus if
you plan on attending more than one event.

5\. You must bring the sheet to me beforehand, and the sections that ask for
name of event, date, place, time, personal contact, contact title, and contact
daytime phone number must be filled out. The daytime phone number cannot be a
home number.

6\. I will then approve/reject the event for extra credit.

7\. If approved, the rest of the extra credit sheet must be filled out upon
completion of the assignment: initialed time in, initialed time out, total
hours, and contact signature. You must check in with the contact person, get
the time in initialed, and repeat this process upon check out of the event,
and then get a signature that all information initialed is valid. Non-
initialed times or unsigned sheets will not be accepted.

8\. The last class to turn in extra credit assignments is the last class
before the final: April 25. No extra credit will be accepted on the day of the
final or between the last class and the final.

9\. The hours of the event must be clearly stated in the evidence supplied
with the hand written summary.

10\. The completed extra credit sheet, along with the evidence of attendance
and your written summary, must be turned in together, stapled or fastened in
some way, at the next class (up to April 25) even if the event was the night
before. A separate extra credit sheet must be used for each event.

11\. You cannot turn in all of your extra credit assignments at once, and you
cannot turn in all or most of your extra credit work on the last class day. I
further do not want more than 6 assignments turned in on any given class day.
This means that you can attend an average of one extra event a day per week,
minus the day you spend in class, for a total of 6 events per week. Yes, if
you don't attend an event on, say, a Friday, you can attend two on a Saturday
--the 6 again represent an average of one event per day per week.

12\. In order to rent a movie, you must have attended an actual event.

13\. The number of movies you can rent per event attended is one, even if the
event was worth 40 points. It is not one movie for every 5 points of extra
credit earned. It is one movie for every event no matter how long the event
lasted.

14\. Movie reviews and event summaries must be hand written.

15\. Movie reviews must answer the questions listed in the syllabus under
Video Reports.

16\. Reviews must start by referencing the extra credit event that qualified
the reviewer to watch the movie.

17\. Extra credit summaries must reference where the event was advertised.

18\. Movies can be watched in groups, but the reviews and assessments must be
written separately.

19\. Extra credit events can be attended in groups but make sure the contact
can vouch for you as an individual and that the extra credit sheet is filled
out properly in regard to time in/out as if you were the only one who went.

20\. If you cannot secure the necessary evidence of your attendance, find a
different activity where you can.

**



Video Reports

**

If you have received extra credit for one (1) event in the community, you are
eligible to earn extra credit points for one (1) video. Do two (2) events, see
two (2) videos, etc. For example, if you attend a city council meeting, you
can rent _Norma Rae_. If you listen to an international lecture at the
University of Maryland, then you can rent _Malcolm X_. You cannot just rent
videos. You must do community-based activities to be eligible to rent a video.
You can then earn 5 points for a 1-page report on what you thought (see
question format below) of the following videos:

**

American History X  
Born on the 4th of July  
Glory  
Hoffa  
JFK  
The Trial of Lee Harvey Oswald  
Malcom X  
Nixon  
Norma Rae  
Panther **

You must photocopy the video store receipt and staple it to your one-page,
hand written review. The receipt must clearly list the name of the video and
your name as the account holder. The review will consist of the following
questions:

What was the lesson or message of the story?

Was the message convincing?

Was it well done; was the movie enjoyable?

What scene surprised you the most and why?

What scene had the biggest impact on you and why?

**

  

**Total Points and Grades**

**

The total points possible for the course is 1000, and grades will be based on
the following:

1000-900:  A

899-800:  B

799-700:  C

699-600: D

599-0: F

**What grades say:**

A| correct and suggestively evaluated  
---|---  
B| correct and shows individual input  
C| all factually correct  
D| incomplete, too brief  
F| factually wrong  
  
**Attendance is crucial.** You need to attend class in order to fully
participate in the in-class assignments and the exams. Unless you have prior
permission to take an exam earlier than I've scheduled, you must take them the
day they are given. If you must miss an exam or quiz, arrangements can be made
for you to make it up through the Office of History and Political Science
before the next class but there will be a late penalty of one full grade for
each week late. After you take the make-up test, you must bring me some piece
of physical evidence of the absence; a doctor's note, a traffic report, a
letter from your boss, etc. that would excuse the absence. You will still have
a late penalty, but with a valid excuse you may make up the exam.

](MAILTO:mkatz@wesleyan.edu)This course will study women in ancient Greece in
relation to the history and institutions of the polis (city-state), and will
give equal weight to each of the two course title topics ("women" and
"polis"). Beginning with the subject of (1) women and the origins of the polis
in the archaic period, we will go on to study (2) women in relation to the
religious, political, economic, social, and judicial institutions of the polis
in the classical period, and then (3) to reconsider each of these two main
topics in more depth, by discussing together the results of students'
researches into a variety of sub-topics. The main focus of the course will be
on women and the socio-cultural institutions of ancient Greece in the archaic
and early classical periods. In each week of the course, reading from a
secondary source will be paired with reading of a primary text.  

* * *

Preference for registration for this course is given to Classics and Classical
Studies Majors, Women's Studies Majors, Seniors, and Juniors, with no
preferential distinctions among these groups. Sophomores have second priority;
Frosh are not eligible for admission.  
  
**Please Note:** Students with no background either in some aspect of ancient
Greek culture or some aspect of Women's History are eligible for admission to
this course. Students will derive most profit from the course, however, if
they bring to it some experience in one or both of these areas.  
If you question whether this is the right course for you, please see me during
my Office Hours (above).

** For each week, there are supplementary materials (background information
and study questions) available on the web site for the course. Students should
familiarize themselves with these materials as they are preparing their
assignments, and before coming to class.

* * *

![](http://www.wesleyan.edu/~mkatz/cciv243/243.schoolscene.jpg)**2\. Writing:
Written Assignments**

Each student will be required to develop an **HTML project** (a World Wide Web
Site) for the course.  
Early on in the semester, there will be a evening-hour tutorial session to
teach you the basics of constructing a Web Site; a student will also be
available for consultation throughout the semester.  
  
The midterm for the course will consist of an **HTML outline** for your
project. Topics are posted on the [**CCIV 243 Paper Topics
Site**](http://www.wesleyan.edu/~mkatz/Images2/cciv243.papertopics.html).
There are also links to sites which will help you in developing your project.

If you would like to get an idea of what such a project might look like,
consult the [**"papers" submitted for Classics
135**](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/~gcrane/cl135.html#projects) at Tufts
University in Spring 1997. This will also show you that working on such a
project offers a great deal of scope for imagination and that, once you get
through the basics of Web Page construction, it will be fun!

During the last five class sessions, and during the three hours reserved for
this course during exam period, students will present their WEB SITE PROJECTS
to the class. The assigned reading for these classes will cover the material
on which the Web Site is based. (For each project, the assigned reading will
be roughly equivalent to one Greek tragedy.)

class as their [**final
projects**](http://www.wesleyan.edu/~mkatz/cciv243/cciv243.studentsites.html).

Discussion: Class Attendance and Other Requirements**

This course is a discussion seminar. Students are expected to complete the
readings and other assignments before class, hand in outlines on time and come
to class prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day. Each student
will receive a grade for class participation, which will include a grade
reflecting their comments on other students' projects, and this grade will
make up **50%** of the final grade for the course.  
  
Thus, if you do not _come to class prepared_ on a regular basis, and do not
_participate in class discussion_ regularly, you will do poorly in this
course. **Take this requirement seriously and consider its implications before
enrolling for this course!  
  
** To make it easier for you to do well in this part of the course, there is a
[**HyperNews
Site**](http://condor.wesleyan.edu/HyperNews/get/spring98/cciv243.html) for
the course on which you can (a) continue discussion of issues raised in class
and introduce new issues related to the week's topic, and (b) contribute your
thoughts and ideas in the event that you have to miss class for medical,
sports, family emergency, or other pressing reasons.  
To see what a course HyperNews Site looks like, link here to the [**HyperNews
Site for CCIV 110**](http://condor.wesleyan.edu/cgi-
bin/HyperNews/get/cciv110.html) (Fall 1997), where students posted their
papers and commented on each others' papers. (This link will be removed
shortly after the beginning of the Spring 1998 semester.)  
See also the Forum for Religion 204 (Fall 1997). Follow this link to the
[**Homepage for Religion 204**](http://www.wesleyan.edu/~jzwelling/reli204/)
and click on Forum in the left-hand Frame. This site resembles closely what
ours for CCIV 243 will look like.  
  
Your HTML outline and HTML final project (described above under 2. Writing)
will make up **50%** of your final grade.

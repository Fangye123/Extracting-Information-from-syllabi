[](http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ahstguide_f.htm)  THE COURSE.
During this semester, we will study the development of western civilization--
our civilization--from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern farming villages
more than 10,000 years ago to the Hellenistic civilization fostered by the
conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when humankind emerged from
cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to build cities, and to
devise the complex system of social relationships we call civilization. We
will see how the invention of writing allows the study of "history," and how
it allows us to observe the systems of government, society, and laws of the
ancients. Through preserved ancient writing, we will also observe the
formation of states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that recurs with
infinite variations over and over throughout the brief period of humankind's
recorded history.  This course will try to demonstrate how similar we are in
many ways to our ancient relatives, and how our basic characteristics as a
species remain unchanged. Due to the span of time we examine, we will be
moving quickly from one period to another, and the effect may at times be
confusing.  Hang in there. I promise that it will all come together.  Above
all I want to get you to think and to analyze, to question "facts" and to
develop your own opinions, for these are the true benefits of studying
history.

**     Knapp = **A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western Asia
& Egypt._ 4th ed.

Mass. 5th ed., 1996.

  INTERNET RESOURCES: During this semester you should become familiar with the
online Perseus Project database (<http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/>), which
contains Greek texts in translation (and the original), an
[atlas](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/atlas), a collection of useful
[images](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/art&arch.html) (e.g.: coins, sites,
artifacts, buildings), an [encyclopedia](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=encyclopedia+toc), an [historical
overview](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=trm+ov+toc),
bibliography and [other research
tools](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/lexica.html).

  ADDITIONS TO THE WEB PAGE: In general, I will use the web page to
communicate with you between classes.  It would be a good idea to check the
course Web Page regularly for updates
(http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_99.htm).

  REQUIREMENTS.  There will be two map quizzes, and two in-class essay exams.
In order to "help" you keep up with your reading assignments, there will be
**_simple_** quizzes at the beginning of selected class periods.   The quizzes
are designed to see if you have read the assignments **_and will necessarily
be of a general nature_**.   They will occur roughly once a week.  The first
essay exam will constitute 30% of your grade, the second one 50% and the
quizzes and class participation/attendance the remaining 20%.  Some important
concepts and issues will be presented only in class, and for this reason,
class participation forms a significant portion of the final grade.

INTRODUCTION TO POLITICAL SCIENCE  
COURSE SYLLABUS  
**POLITICAL SCIENCE AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS 1101**

**Dr. Charles E. Neal**

**-COURSE OBJECTIVES-**

> Welcome to Introduction to Political Science. For most of you this will be a
new experience since you are unfamiliar with the field of political science.
It will remind some of you of courses you have taken in American National
Government or Civics. It is, however, important to note that the above
mentioned courses focused on the history of American Government and sought to
turn you into "good citizens." This course is intended to turn you into good
political scientists. The course will help you to ask the right questions
about governmental systems and supply you with tools needed to compare
political systems.

>

> To be more precise, a course entitled "Introduction to Political Science"
must be organized around four main concerns of political science: the
substance of the discipline, political research methodology, political
behavior, and public policy. In the weeks ahead, we will examine all of the
ways political scientists have looked at political science. In doing so, we
will explore examples of politics in several countries including Great
Britain, Italy, France, and of course the United States. Much of the material
will be new to you and interesting, I hope.

**-COURSE MATERIALS-**

> There is only one book required for this course. It is not difficult to
read, but I suggest you read the assignments before you come to class. During
class I will add material not covered in the book and often take issue with
some of the findings. You may not know when this is occurring unless you have
read the material. I would also suggest that you read the material or skim it
after class and insert the material from the lecture. Outlining the chapter or
writing in the margins of your book could do this. Unlike high school, college
courses assume that you can read and have read the textbook. You will
therefore be responsible for material in the textbook whether or not we
discuss it in class. You are also encouraged to ask questions on the textbook
material you do not understand.

>

> You are required to read one good newspaper everyday. The newspaper must be
either The Washington Post, or The New York Times. You may read the TV News
(USA Today, that is,) but only as an index to a real newspaper. This, course
requires a familiarity with current events that can only come from reading a
newspaper daily. You can also keep up by watching CNN. This, however, is not a
substitute for reading the newspaper.

**-TEXTBOOK-**

> The Human Polity: An Introduction to Political Science, Third Edition by Kay
Lawson.

**-COURSE REQUIREMENTS-**

> **Examinations:**

>

>> There are three examinations in this course, two term exams and one final.
Each examination contains listing, identification, and essay questions. The
term exams are worth (100) one hundred points each. The final is comprehensive
and is worth (150) one hundred and fifty points. The three exams are
collectively worth (350) three hundred and fifty points.

>

> **Quizzes:**

>

>> Quizzes are always an option to be exercised at my discretion. If I
perceive a lack of interest or poor attendance, quizzes are probable. They
cover material covered during the week preceding the quiz. Quizzes always
contain multiple choice questions.

>

> **Make-up Examinations:**

>

>> History has shown that it is important to set a policy on make-up
examinations at the beginning of the semester. Make-up examinations cause
students, instructors, secretaries, and the copy center many problems. Since
there are so many people involved in putting together a make-up examination,
you must meet the following criteria before the examination is given:

>>

>>> 1\. You must request the make-up exam twenty-four hours before it occurs
and have a valid verifiable excuse.  
>  2\. You must get someone to tell me that you are ill before the
examination.

>>

>> Make-up examinations will not be given under the following circumstances,
_SO DON'T ASK_.  
>

>>

>>> 1\. Social Events.  
>  2\. Extra-curricula activities other than previously.  
>  scheduled athletic or college sponsored events.  
>  3\. Going home early because "It's the only ride I can get."  
>  4\. Other sloppy excuses.

>>

>> This policy is not an attempt to be unreasonable, but if you had to prepare
as many as twelve (12) different make-up exams, you would understand it's
necessity.

>

> **Student Paper:**

>

>> Each of you must write a paper on a political topic found in the newspaper.
This paper should be a combination of your position and evidence to support
that position. This evidence must come primarily from sources other than the
popular media. This means your paper must include cited library materials, not
encyclopedias or dictionaries. Finally the paper must be typed and no more
than five (5) pages long.

>

>  
>  **Attendance:**

>

>> This is a fairly small class and in about a week I will know all of you by
face if not by name. I will take attendance for a week or two, but not after.
It is to your benefit to be in class everyday because I will cover material
not found in your textbook.

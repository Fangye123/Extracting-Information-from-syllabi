**INTL 200  
Dilemmas in the International System  
New Perspectives on Development  
Spring 2002**

In this course we will explore recent thinking on development and recent
projects carried out in the name of 'development.' While development theory
has, in my opinion, become somewhat stagnant over the past decade, people
throughout the world continue to struggle with issues related to economic
opportunities, quality of life, disease and environmental degradation. During
the semester we will look at where development theorizing and practice has
been, as well as explore some relatively new development issues that are being
raised in connection with women's role(s) in 'development' and the growing
interest in environmental issues in connection with development strategies
tied to ecotourism.

**Required readings:**

The following texts are available in the Denison University bookstore for

**Course Requirements:**

Participation \- Active participation in class is required. Indeed, there is
no way you can do well in the class without it. This means that you will
attend class, that you will prepare by thoroughly reading the required text
(or undertaking other required assignments) and that you are prepared to
participate in a meaningful way in discussions about the material. Those of
you who have had me in the past know that my pedagogical approach relies on a
combination of lecture and discussion. This approach only works when you are
prepared, interested and curious. Participation will count for 15% of your
grade.

Essays \- You will have the opportunity to write three essays during the
semester. The essays will raise issues pertinent to required materials and
class discussions. I will provide you with an essay topic and you will have a
week to complete the 5-6 page essays. Each essay will count for 15% of your
grade for a total of 45%.

Research Paper \- You will be asked to do a research paper on a particular
development project or organization engaged in the practice of development.
Details of the research project will be handed out in early February. This is
a substantial research assignment that will require a sustained effort for
approximately 10 weeks of the semester. The research paper will count for 25%
of your final grade.

Final Essay \- In lieu of a comprehensive final exam I will ask you to write
an essay in which you reflect on the issue of development. This essay will be
due during our regularly scheduled exam period and will count for 15% of your
final grade.

**Policies:**

_Coming Late to Class_ : Students who arrive late disrupt the class. I will
shut the door five minutes into the class. If you arrive and the door is
closed, you may not enter.

_Incompletes and Late Work_ : According to University policy, "Incompletes
will be awarded only in cases of illness, serious personal problems, death in
the family or other extraordinary circumstances." A student will not be
granted an incomplete simply because additional time is needed to complete the
assigned work. If you wish to request an incomplete, you must petition the
instructor and the Registrar's Advisory Board no later than the last day of
class.

Late assignments will only be accepted under extremely extenuating
circumstances, eg. severe illness (documented by a physician) or a death in
your family (documented by a published obituary). Poor time management skills
or computer failure are not acceptable reasons for late work.

_Students with Learning Disabilities_ : Any student who feels that he or she
may need an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact
me privately as soon as possible to discuss their specific needs. I rely on
the Office of Academic Support in 104 Doane to verify the need for
accommodation based on documentation on file in their office.

_Submitting assignments via email_ : I do not accept assignments via email. In
the past I have had too many problems with lost assignments, incompatible
formats, etc. Please hand in all assignments at the beginning of class on the
day they are due.

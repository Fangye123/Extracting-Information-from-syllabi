**_COURSE OBJECTIVES_**  
**_Course Overview_**  
Images of crime and criminals are a pervasive aspect of the popular culture
landscape in the United States. Almost nightly pseudo-scientific television
shows and investigative news programs offer up their views on the extent and
nature of crime in the U.S. Politicians also play their own role in shaping
public discourse about crime and criminals, routinely delivering speeches on
the need for tougher sentencing guidelines for juveniles, greater application
of the "three strikes and you're out rule" for repeat offenders, and increased
legislation to protect the rights of crime victims. The primary goal of this
course is to help students develop the skills they need to separate myth from
fact in ongoing public debates about the extent and nature of crime in the
U.S., its causes, and various approaches to preventing crime and punishing (or
rehabilitating) criminals. Whether explicitly stated or only implied, any
discussion of crime relies on certain assumptions about what causes crime, who
commits crimes, and what needs to be done about crime. After completing this
course, students should be able to identify and discuss what those assumptions
are, assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of those assumptions, and
discuss various alternative approaches to the study of crime.  
  
**_Course Objectives_**  
The primary objective of this course is to help students develop the skills
they need to critically evaluate public discussions and scholarly research on
the extent and nature of crime and measures taken to reduce crime. Course
material will facilitate the development of those skills by:  
  
1\. Discussing the major approaches to measuring the extent and nature of
crime in the United States.  
  
2\. Providing students a brief history of criminology and an overview of
various theoretical explanations of crime.  
  
3\. Identifying various types of crime (e.g., property, violent, white-collar,
and public order) and discussing their major trends.  
  
4\. Introducing students to the criminal justice system and its processes
aimed at detecting and controlling crime, prosecuting criminals, and
administering punishment.

* It is important to note that this course outline is tentative and may be changed by the instructor. In the event changes to the outline are made, students will be notified in class. It is important, therefore, that students attend class to learn about important changes.  
  
**_EXAMS AND MAJOR ASSIGNMENTS_**  
Student grades for this course will be based on each student's performance on
two major exams, three short writing assignments, and one term paper.
Important due dates are listed in the attached course outline.  
  
  
**_Exams_**  
There will be two required exams in this course: a mid-term and a final. The
mid-term exam will consist of all material from class discussions and required
readings that are covered prior to the exam date (October 13). The final exam
(December 14 from 8:30-10:20 a.m.) will consist of all material from class
discussions and required readings that are covered after the mid-term exam
(i.e., the final exam is not "comprehensive" in nature).  
  
Each exam will contain 35 multiple choice questions, 1 short list question,
and 1 essay question. The relative weight of each type of question for each
exam is as follows:  
  
35 multiple choice 35 points  
1 short list 5 points  
_1 essay_ _10 points_  
Total 50 points x 2 exams= 100 points  
  
  
**_Term Paper_**  
Each student will also be required to submit a term paper based on a true
crime novel chosen by the student. The paper should be at least 10 double-
spaced, typed pages, and it must include at least 10 citations to published
scholarly work. The paper should provide a summary of the crime described in
the book, a detailed account of the explanation developed by the author, and a
more elaborate sociological explanation developed from the student's
understanding of course materials. Additional details for the term paper will
be provided in class.  
  
The relative weight of the term paper for grading purposes is as follows:  
  
Term Paper 50 points  
  
  
**_Late Assignments_**  
Short writing assignments and term papers that are submitted after the due
date will be penalized by 15 %, and they will not be accepted after 2 class
meetings beyond the stated due date (in which case a score of zero would be
applied for that assignment).  
  
**_Missed Exams_**  
Only in extenuating circumstances, such as family crisis, illness or injury
sufficient to require medical care (which can be documented), participation in
a university sponsored event which requires the student's absence from campus
on the day of the exam, and similar reasons beyond the student's control, will
make-up provisions apply. Advise the instructor in advance of absences due to
such matters, if possible. If a make-up examination is required, it will be
administered on the last day of finals week during the period scheduled for
make-up examinations.  
  
**_OTHER REQUIREMENTS (FIELD TRIPS, ETC.)_**  
**_Short Writing Assignments_**  
There will be three required short writing assignments in this course, each of
which must be between 3 and 5 double-spaced, typed pages. Each of these
assignments will be evaluated in terms of organization, clarity of
presentation (including spelling and grammar), and strength of argument. The
relative weight of each of these assignments for grading purposes is as
follows:  
  
Short writing assignment #1 15 points  
Short writing assignment #2 15 points  
_Short writing assignment #3_ _20 points_  
Total 50 points  
  
__Short Writing Assignment #1__  
For the first of these assignments (due September 8), each student is required
to summarize an article from a newspaper or news magazine (or an internet news
site) that discusses a crime that has been committed or reports on a broader
crime trend. Student write-ups should include a brief overview of the article,
a detailed discussion of the crime or crime trend described in the article,
and a brief critique of the assumptions made in the article about crime and/or
criminals.  
  
__Short Writing Assignment #2__  
The second of these assignments (due October 6) will require each student to
summarize a scholarly article on crime, crime control efforts, or corrections.
In particular, each student will identify and discuss the research question(s)
addressed in the article, briefly describe the research method used to address
the question, and summarize the major findings of the research. Additional
details for this assignment will be provided in class prior to the due date.  
  
__Short Writing Assignment #3__  
The third short writing assignment (due November 10) will require each student
to assess the relative merits of various explanations of crime discussed in
class. Students are expected to outline the strengths and weaknesses of at
least two approaches and discuss ways in which they may be integrated to offer
a more developed explanation of crime, citing relevant material from course
readings. Additional details for this assignment will be provided in class
prior to the due date.  
  
  
**_GRADING PROCEDURES_**  
To summarize, course requirements and their relative weight for grading
purposes are as follows:  
  
Mid-term Exam 50 points  
Final Exam 50 points  
Short Writing Assignment #1 15 points  
Short Writing Assignment #2 15 points  
Short Writing Assignment #3 20 points  
_Term Paper_ _50 points_  
Total 200 points  
  
Student grades will be calculated on the following scale:  
  
_Points earned_ _Grade_  
180-200 A  
160-179 B  
140-159 C  
120-139 D  
0-119 F  
  
**_POLICY ON ATTENDANCE_**  
**_Class Attendance and Class Conduct_**  
Because students will be evaluated on the basis of their understanding of
required course readings and issues discussed in class, regular and punctual
class attendance is necessary and expected. Moreover, because learning is a
collective process that engages all participants (instructor and students) in
a shared experience, the learning environment is enhanced when participation
is maximized. It is expected that students will conduct themselves in a manner
that is professional and courteous. The OSU Student Rights and
Responsibilities Handbook provides additional information on these issues, as
does the section on "general expectations of students" of the syllabus
attachment.

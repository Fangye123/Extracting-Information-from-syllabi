**Texts and Resources** :

M. Morford, L. Lenardon, _Classical Mythology_ 5 (Longman) ["ML"]  
Euripides, _Ten Plays_ (Bantam)  
Grene, D., trans., _Sophocles I_ (Chicago)  
Lattimore, R., trans., _Aeschylus, Aeschylus I_ (Chicago)  
Racine, Jean B., _Phaedra & Other Plays_ (Penguin)  
_Perseus_ 2.0 (on-line)

In this course, we will examine the major myths of the Greeks and Romans, and
study the origins, impact on classical culture (literature and art), and
lasting effect of classical mythology on later civilization. We will approach
our study primarily through Greek and Roman literature and iconography.

The basic _text book_ (Morford  & Lenardon) contains extended quotes from
several authors, and also contains useful background material for the
literature assignments. The major authors that we will read are (those marked
with an asterisk * are in ML): Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Hesiod, Homer,
Homeric Hymns*, Plato*, Vergil, Ovid*, & Lucian*, and from the post-classical
period the French author Racine.

Since classical mythology affected art in addition to literature, many class
presentations will be accompanied by images (slides, Perseus images, etc.) of
ancient and post-ancient art. One of the goals of the course is to provide the
tools necessary for a student to recognize myths and characters in art.

**Requirements**

**Exams**. There will be two exams during the semester, plus the final exam
(dates given in schedule below). Each exam will include objective questions
(for example, fill in the blank), slide identifications (the myths or
characters represented), and short essays. Please note that make-up exams are
the _rare_ exception, not the rule, and are allowed _at the discretion of the
instructor_ ; such matters must be arranged in advance of the regularly
scheduled exam time.

[**Paper**](mythpap.html). The paper, 10-15 pages in length, is to be on a
work of literature (ancient or post-ancient) that makes extensive use of
classical myth (a work that is not otherwise assigned as one of the course
readings). More detailed instructions and advice will be provided later in the
semester. _The paper must be written using with a word processing program_.
Help with Microsoft Word (DOS, Windows, and Mac versions) will be provided by
the instructor on request. Deadlines are Nov. 11 for the rough and Nov. 18 for
the final drafts respectively, and are noted in the schedule below.
**Deadlines are firm** , and penalties will be assessed for each day late (one
day ends, and another begins, at **5:00 p.m.** ): rough draft, 5 points per
day off final paper grade; final draft, 10 points per day off final paper
grade. Your instructor is cold and cruel, and very strict about these matters.

**Class participation, attendance**. The final factor is class
participation/attendance. The normal expectation is that students will be at
every class, for one cannot participate _in absentia_! Participation also
involves preparation of homework assignments before class. Participation will
be assessed not so much on quantity as on quality.

Students should feel free to express their own opinions on various matters
related to the course and to ask questions. Students' interpretations need not
necessarily be the same as those of the instructor. As long as interpretations
are based upon reasoned assessments of the evidence (literary, historical,
archaeological), they are as valid as the instructor's.

This concept has been reinforced through cooperative work of SU students and
faculty, which resulted in a provision of the SU Academic Rights for Students.
It bears repeating here:

> Faculty members should encourage free thought and expression both in the
classroom and out. Students are entitled to disagree with interpretation of
data or views of a faculty member and reserve judgment in matters of opinion,
but this disagreement does not excuse them from learning the content of any
course for which they are enrolled or from demonstrating skills and
competencies required by a faculty member. Students should be evaluated solely
on academic performance.

**Summary of requirements, with percentages** :

> | Exam #1 (September 27)| 20% | Exam #2 (October 30)| 20% | Final Exam| 30%
| Paper (rough, November 11; final, November 18)| 20% | Class
partic./attendance| 10%

**Final Grades**.

> The plus and minus grading system, now in effect at Southwestern, will be
used for final grades. Semester % averages will translate to the following
letter grades:

>

> | GRADE| INCLUSIVE  
> % RANGE| GPA POINTS  
>  EQUIV. | A+| 96.7-100.0| 4.00 | A| 93.4-96.6| 4.00 | A-| 90.0-93.3| 3.67 |
B+| 86.7-89.9| 3.33 | B| 83.4-86.6| 3.00 | B-| 80.0-83.3| 2.67 | C+|

**Daily routine**

> **Syllabus**. You should check this syllabus **on-line** _at least once
before each class assignment_. With various resources coming on-line, this
document is a fluid work, and each student is responsible for changes and
corrections to the syllabus.

>

> Several assignments are accesible through "hot links" on this syllabus.
Click on the link in the right hand column of the daily assignments below to
be connected to the homework source. Hot links usually appear underlined and
in blue or purple; in the hardcopy of this syllabus, the links are underlined.

>

> **"Handouts"**. Each day in class, instead of handing out hard copies of the
day's technical terms, names, dates, maps, etc., the "handout" will be
projected in the classroom. You are strongly encouraged to access the handouts
on the Web.

>

> You can access the handout in three ways:

>

>   * click on the date in the syllabus schedule below (you will be able to
tell whether I have created the handout by the "hot link" convention for the
date, usually blue or purple in Netscape)

>   * access the handouts directly. The convention that I use is (without the
quotes) "myth _date_.html". For example, the file for the handout for
September 23 would be "myth0923.html". The full location address is:
http://www.southwestern.edu/academic/classical.languages/myth/myth _date_.html

>   * Navigate through the Web: From the SU Homepage, click "academic
departments," then "Classics Home Page," then "Mythology handout Index." Click
on the appropriate date. (index address:

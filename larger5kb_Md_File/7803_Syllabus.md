####  OBJECTIVES:

To study the theory and practice of professional financial statement auditing
and to prepare for the CPA exam. The successful completion of this course
provides a basic understanding of the auditing process.  The course also
examines assurance services, professional ethics, auditor legal liability,
audit sampling, and other audit reports.  Any student who wishes to sit for
the CPA exam is strongly encouraged to take ACCT 4376 Advanced Auditing.  ACCT
4376 will provide details of auditing specific transaction cycles and will
emphasize practical applications with a practice case.

####  ACADEMIC HONESTY:

All aspects of the University's [academic honesty
policy](http://www.uh.edu/dos/hdbk/acad/achonpol.html) apply to this course.
Notes, books, and similar means are not allowed to be used on exams. By
becoming a member of this class you are demonstrating an interest in a
profession that is distinguished by its integrity and objectivity. The
instructor will strive to maintain these ideals at all times and the students
will be expected to do the same.

Cases and exercises that are to be turned in for a grade should only be
discussed with students that are currently enrolled in this class (i.e., not
employers, professors, or other students who are **not currently** enrolled in
the course).

Exams should **not** be discussed with students who are **not currently**
enrolled in the course.   Furthermore, a student who has **not taken** an exam
should **not** discuss that exam with a student that **has taken** the exam.
A discussion would include any verbal or nonverbal exchange concerning content
and/or difficulty of the exam.  On exam days **, any** discussions that you
have with students in another section of the course will be considered
inappropriate, highly suspicious and will be investigated.

**GRADES:**

Except as noted under Homework/Quizzes, Cases/Exercises, and Professional
Behavior, grades will be computed as follows:  
  Exam I | 100  
---|---  
Exam II | 100  
Final Exam (cumulative) | 125  
Audit Cases/Quizzes |  75  
Total | 400  
  
  Grade |   Percentage  
---|---  
A |  90-100%  
B |  80-89%  
C |  70-79%  
D |  60-69%  
F |  50-59%  
  
####  EXAMS:

Exams will be given as scheduled!  Schedule interviews, work schedules,
accordingly.  The final exam will be given during the University scheduled
time. MAKE-UP (or early) EXAMS WILL NOT BE GIVEN unless the Dean's Office
provides an excuse AND the instructor approves.  **Any conflicts should be
noted in writing during the first week of class.**

Exams will be similar to CPA exams, although the proportion of multiple choice
questions may be less, and may contain prior CPA exam questions.  Questions
regarding the grading of exams should be submitted in writing on the exam
coverage days.

####  HOMEWORK/QUIZZES:

Homework will NOT be collected.  Homework problems may be included on exams.
Unannounced quizzes may be given and will be calculated with the case scores.

**CASES/EXERCISES:**

You may obtain assistance from individuals in the class, but the work you
submit must be your own. No OUTSIDE assistance is permitted.  Assignments are
due AT THE BEGINNING OF CLASS on the date specified in the course schedule.
Late assignments will be penalized 1/2 credit and not accepted after the class
meeting.  All assignments should be identified by social security number only
(please no names).  Group members will have the opportunity to evaluate each
other at the end of the project.  Grades could be adjusted downward for
individuals receiving less than satisfactory evaluations from their group
members.

Each assignment will be graded separately.  At the end of the semester,
seventy-five points will be allocated among the individual assignments.

Mastering writing skills is an ongoing and important process.  Grammar and
spelling will be graded on projects.  All members will accept responsibility
for the final product and, accordingly, will share in the grade.  If you
anticipate problems in this area, please consider using  LEARNING SUPPORT
SERVICES (321 SOCIAL WORK BUILDING - (713)-743-5411.  Hours are as follows:  
                        M, T    9-8   
                        W, Th  9-6   
                        F         9-12 

Certain web sites deal with [common errors in
English](http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/errors/).  Other web sites specifically
support those individuals who use [English as a second
language](http://www.cln.org/subjects/esl_cur.html).  Try the [grammar
lady](http://www.grammarlady.com) if you have specific questions.   If you
find these sites or others helpful, please let me know
([bobrich@uh.edu](mailto:bobrich@uh.edu)).

Students who choose to participate as a subject in a research study (conducted
by Dr. Louis Orchard) this semester will be relieved of the obligation of
turning in the homework assignments due on March 28 (worth 3-4% of your course
grade) and on April 23 (worth another 3-4% of your course grade), and will be
given grades of 100% on these two assignments.  _No student will be required
to participate as a subject in a research study._   A sign-up sheet for those
interested in participating as a research subject will be circulated early in
the semester.  The study would involve decision-making on your part, and would
involve no known or forseeable risks to you from participating.  In addition
to course credit, students participating as research subjects will earn
approximately $10 per hour, on average, plus a $5 fee for showing up on time
for the study.  However, the actual amount a given subject would earn might
depend on the decisions he or she makes.

####  PROFESSIONAL BEHAVIOR:

You will be expected to conduct yourself in a professional manner.  This
includes respect for your _peers_ and for the professor.   I do not expect
this to be a problem, but if it is, your grade will be adjusted downward at my
judgment.  Extreme offenses will result in dismissal from the class with an
"F" for a grade.

Punctual attendance is expected.  You are expected to conduct yourself in the
same fashion that you would on your first job.  You will be responsible for
all material missed during an absence (e.g. lecture content, course schedule,
exam content, etc.).

Cell phones or pagers that ring during an exam will result in a one point loss
on that exam.  A second offense will result in a five point loss and every
offense thereafter will result in double the penalties of the prior offense.
If for some reason (i.e., medical or other) you need to have a cell phone on
during the exam, you must notify me prior to that exam.  


####  SPECIAL NEEDS:

 The Center for Students with Disabilities provides a wide variety of academic
support services to all currently enrolled UH students who have any type of
mental or physical disability of either a temporary or permanent nature.
These services include assistance with course accommodations, adaptive
equipment, individualized exam administration, taped textbooks, wheelchair
repair, library needs, registration, handicapped parking, accessible housing
and transportation, as well as many other needs.  If you feel that you may
need assistance of this nature, you may wish to call the Center at 3-5400.  In
addition, you should let me know about any special needs as soon as possible.

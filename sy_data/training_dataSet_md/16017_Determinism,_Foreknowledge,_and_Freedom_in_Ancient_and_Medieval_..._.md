**Course description**

We will explore issues centering around whether human freedom is compatible
with (i) causal determinism, with (ii) all statements about the future
currently having a determinate truth-value, and with (iii) God having
foreknowledge of what we will do, as discussed by ancient and medieval
philosophers.

That is, the philosophers we will be studying will be asking questions like
the following: (i) If it is causally determined by the present positions and
motions of the atoms that make up my soul that I will kill my spouse, can I
rightly be blamed for doing so, and does it make sense for me to deliberate
about whether I should kill my spouse or not? (ii) How about if it is now
_true,_ and has always been true, that I will kill my spouse tomorrow? (iii)
How about if God knows, and has always known, that tomorrow I will kill my
spouse? And can God be justified in sending me to Hell for doing so? How about
if God causes me to do what I do?

**Class format**

This class will primarily be seminar format, and class discussion of the
readings will play a major role. The midterm and final exam will consist of
take-home essay questions; there will be frequent short reading response
papers, and a longer final paper that the student will have the option of
revising and resubmitting.

I will rotate the schedule of reading response papers, so that every class
period one student will submit a paper. You will post this paper to the class
bulletin board.  Please post your paper the night before the class, at the
latest. Everybody will be responsible for reading the reading response papers
before the class meeting. Feel free to post your own responses to others'
papers on the bulletin board, or to put comments or questions there also. I
may occasionally require somebody to post a response to others' work.

Typically, I will explain the material in the first half of the class. We will
take a break, and then the second half of the class will be devoted to
discussing the material, using the reading response papers as a way to start
the discussion. But this division is not meant to be hard and fast:
discussions and evaluation will often break out during the first part of the
class, and during the course of discussing the material in the second part,
sometimes I may go back to clarify some points in the material.

The bulletin board, announcements, copies of this syllabus, and a trove of
other information is available from the course web site,

![](blueline.gif) **NOTE ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:**

If any student plagiarizes in writing a paper--that is, copies or closely
paraphrases from a source without proper quotation and acknowledgment of the
source--then that student will be given a failing grade either on the paper or
in the course. I will discuss proper footnoting procedures in class.

![](blueline.gif) University Grading Standards

**A** achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet
course requirements.

**B** achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet
course requirements.

**C** achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.

**D** achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully
the course requirements.

**S** achievement that is satisfactory, which is equivalent to a C- or better.

**F (or N)** Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the work was
either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of
credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the
instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I.

**I** (Incomplete) Assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to
extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented
from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement
between instructor and student.

![](blueline.gif) **Credits and Workload Expectations**

For undergraduate courses, one credit is defined as equivalent to an average
of three hours of learning effort per week (over a full semester) necessary
for an average student to achieve an average grade in the course. For example,
a student taking a three credit course that meets for three hours a week
should expect to spend an additional six hours a week on coursework outside
the classroom.

Week One: Introduction (Thursday, January 13, 2000) **  
** Discussion of themes and issues that will be addressed through this
seminar: general overview. Unity and difference in Johns's work. Brief visit
of the exhibition of Johns's latest works at the Art Gallery.

Week Two (January 20, 2000): The Meaning of the Beginning  
"I started drawing when I was three, and I've never stopped."  
Johns's paradoxical artistic beginning: Johns presents art as a fait accompli
in his existence from early childhood onwards. Yet, beginning his career as an
artist took an act of destruction of all the works he had produced (Fall
1954). Then, came an act of self-reinvention. "I thought: "Here I am, still
going to be an artist." What was different? What needed to be changed, so that
I would BE, rather than GOING TO BE?" (KV, 124). Flag's importance as the
artist's first public work. Flag's sources and meanings: Robert Frank; its use
by Rauschenberg in Short Circuit, and subsequent works.

Week Three (January 27, 2000): The late '50s/early '60s-a crucial hinge (I)  
"The brand-new darling of the art world " (Time Magazine) What happened to
Johns after his spectacular debut? Immediate, if but controversial,
recognition: purchase by MoMA (Alfred Barr) of three paintings by Johns. The
late '50s and early '60s arguably saw some of the most dramatic developments
in the artist's career. A few essential events took place between 1959 and
1961 that will continue to carry a definite impact on the artist's future
career:  
1\. Meeting with Duchamp, through writer Nicolas Calas (1959).  
2\. Friendship with Frank O'Hara: reading/writing poetry.  
3\. Friendship and collaboration with Merce Cunningham, and John Cage.  
4\. Meeting with Tatyana Grosman who then suggests that the artist should try
"working lithography on stone."  
5\. Produces first sculpture: The Critic Smiles (1959), soon followed by
Painted Cans (1960).  
6\. Johns evolves new themes that will retain great importance for much of his
career: first Figure paintings (O through 9), introduction of the theme of
separation of the three primary colors (Out the Window)-see Untitled (Red,
Yellow, Blue) 1984-; introduction of the first "device" (Device Circle,
1959)-see the recent paintings at the Art Gallery.

Point #1 will be the subject of a symposium organized by the Art Gallery on
February 25-26.  
Points #2 and 3 will offer the direction of this week's class.  
Point #4 will be the subject of Prof. Field's class just before Spring break.  
Points #5 and 6 will be studied next week. It is important, however, to bear
in mind that all these themes are, to various extents, interrelated in Johns's
art production.

This week, points #2 and 3 (Dance, performance and poetry) will help us in
focusing on three case studies:  
\- Impact of John Cage's music on Johns and Rauschenberg: listen to Variations
II, performed by David Tudor, in Paris (June 20, 1961). For the performance,
Johns contributed a Floral Design signed "Tudor Johns." Performance heavily
criticized by U.S. Information Service in Paris.  
\- Impact of Hart Crane's poetry: study of Diver, 1962, Diver, 1963, Land's
End, 1963, Periscope (Hart Crane), 1963.  
\- Figures, primary colors, and devices in Johns's work.

Week Four (February 3, 2000): The late '50s/early '60s-a crucial hinge (II)  
Focus on points #5 and #6 as defined the previous week: importance of
sculpture  
(Painted Bronze, 1960, The Critic Smiles, 1959, The Critic Sees II, 1964) and
introduction of new themes. Deep relationships between sculptures and prints.  
Introduction of autobiographical themes: study of Souvenir, 1964, and Souvenir
2, 1964.  
The specular gaze in John's work: the role of the mirror, and reversing the
image.  
Imprints, prints and indexicality.  
Introduction of a whole set of new themes: The first Map, 1961: what is the
relationship of these to the works based on primary colors, and to the Flags?  
Ropes, hooks, wires, and hinges: No, 1961, Portrait-Viola Farber, 1961-2;  
Relationship between poetry and dance: See, for instance, Portrait-Viola
Farber, 1961-2, described as a "direct variation on" In Memory of My Feelings-
Frank O'Hara-a work which draws a direct link with the poet and the artist's
friend, O'Hara; at the same time, however, the declared purpose of the present
painting, through its title, is to offer a "portrait" of Viola Farber, a
featured dancer in the Merce Cunningham Company.

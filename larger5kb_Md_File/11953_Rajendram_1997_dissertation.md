**MATERIALS PROVIDED ON THIS WEB PAGE:**  
1\. The instrument provided to media education students for their class
reaction papers  
2\. A selection of sample student papers

**SAMPLE USED IN STUDY:**  
92 undergraduates in a media education class at a large Midwestern US
university. The class consisted of three lectures a week for 10 weeks.
Students were asked to submit five reaction papers to class lectures and
presentations, one for each of five weeks out of the ten in the class. The 92
students submitted a total of 331 reaction papers. In the qualitative analyses
in the dissertation, a variety of units of analysis are employed -- the sense-
making instance (a given instance of thinking, feeling, concluding,
questioning, observing, etc.), the reaction paper, and the student.

SEX IN ADVERTISING  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) I have noticed sex in advertising since about the age of fourteen.  
a) The first example I noticed was the sexual symbolism on packs of Camel
cigarettes.  
b) First is the phallic looking nose of the Joe Camel character. His features
in his facial area resemble the male genitalia.  
c) Also the camel on the front of the box, if you look very closely, you will
notice two people engaging in oral sex. A rather graphic form of sexual
symbolism.  
2) The impact of sexual arousing advertising has an extremely negative effect
on the younger audiences.  
a) Sexual appealing advertising encourages kids that their product will make
them more sexually appealing, and all young teenagers want that.  
b) By making these children more sexually appealing, supposedly, kids are more
apt to have sex, and thus more pregnancies, and sexually transmitted diseases.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) After reading  "Sex Sin and Suggestion", by Carol Moog, I have started to
notice that there is some sort of sexual display in almost all advertising
today.  
a) For example, the Newport ad on page twenty seven of her essay. This looks
like an ad showing people having show much fun and implying that it is because
of smoking. But in reality it is showcasing a classical sexual position.  
b) This type of advertising is very effective, due to the fact that it plays
on our subliminal thoughts of sexual activity.  
2) Whether this sort of sexual display is intentional, which I believe it is,
or not it is very effective in our society.  
a) I recently saw a Coca-Cola commercial on TV, It was showing an empty glass
of ice and coke pouring into it. Then when the coke was done being poured into
the glass the straw, that was in the glass, began to sigh in enjoyment and
rise up, until completely standing straight in the air. This commercial is
playing totally on our sexual senses. Whether it's the act of the straw rising
or the joy in the narration.

SEMANTICS IN TELEVISION  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) I am a religious watcher of the Simpson's. Every episode has some sort of
deep seeded meaning or value.  
a) Episodes centering around Bart usually deal with some form of deceitfulness
upon his peers or family, basically he is the rebel on the show.  
b) Shows dealing with Lisa are centered around women's liberation and equality
for all creatures within the world.  
c) Episodes with the main theme around Marge deal with complex issues such a
love, proper schooling for her children, and here support for anti-violent
television shows.  
d) Episodes with Homer as the main character also deals with complex adult
issues such as money problems, marital struggles and alcohol.  
2) The impact of the Simpson's on the viewers is a very positive one.  
a) The writers of the show always end a happy way.  
b) Although the show often times makes fun of those in authority, for the most
part their analogies are fairly accurate.  
c) Episodes centered around Bart and Homer usually something bad is happening,
such as alcohol abuse or blowing up cars. But in the end they both realize
their mistakes and this instills a sense of values in the viewers minds.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) Now when I watch the Simpson's, every night at 7:00, I watch for semantic
signs.  
a) The episodes that was viewed in class (4/27) was packed full of these
items.  
b) Each of these signs were full of deep meanings. ex. The signifier - The
aptitude test name: CANT. The signified - The acronym resembles the English
word can't, meaning can not, this signifies to the audience that these sorts
of test usually have no say in what you can do with your life. In our society
children and parents take them very seriously.  
2) I know now just how much semantics are used in the development of
television production.  
a) Signs play major roles in almost every TV show, commercial, music video.
The reason they are used so frequently is to relay messages and meanings to
the participating audiences.  
b) I have also learned to watch for signs in TV shows with negative
attributions, such as the ones portrayed in violent cartoons.

RITE OF PASSAGE  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) At least once in every bodies lifetime, we are challenged with an event or
struggle known as a "rite of passage".  
a) No matter who it is, we all experience an event such as this. Whether its
going from diapers to underwear or being initiated as a new member of a
fraternity or graduation day trying to figure out what we going to do with the
rest of our lives.  
2) While involved in this rite of passage you as an individual are supposed to
grow, as a person, during this time period.  
a) Native Indians probably have the most widely known form of the passage. All
of male members of any given tribe at one time had to go through some sort of
test to become a man. By passing the test the individual that went through the
test was seen as a man in the society.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) Personally, when I have experienced a rite of passage I have never looked
at it as different stages, rather as one large step within life.  
a) As suggested to us in lecture Thursday, A typical rite of passage consists
of three stages. The first is a stage of separation, the second is the margin
phase, and lastly is the aggregation phase.  
b) All of these phases are a fairly accurate description of atypical rite of
passage now that I have thought about my own experiences.  
2) I also never realized the aspect of Liminality.  
a) In all of my tests of will there is always that stage where you are not
quite there yet but almost there.  
b) A phase such as puberty, where you are adjusting to the actions occurring
in your body to the point of full maturity is know as the Liminal phase within
the process of "rite of passage".

MAKE-UP?  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) For years I have wondered why in the world would females want to cover
their faces with make-up.  
a) Make up is extremely unnatural looking especially with all of the wild
colors used today. I mean sometimes I just laugh at girls wearing their crazy
color schemes, black lipstick bright orange eye shadow, its ridiculous.  
2) I feel that if a person is not naturally attractive then make-up is not
going to make them any more attractive just more unnatural and more trashy
looking.  
3) I also think that women spend too much time putting make-up on.  
a) Girls take hours to put all their make-up on, some more than others. It
seems to be that it is a lot of wasted time to paint a fake face on. Life is
too short to waste a couple of hours of everyday putting on make-up.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) After watching the video on Thursday, a couple of reasons on why women wear
make-up constantly, were brought to my attention.  
a) They wear it for more respect within society, especially within the work
place.  
b) They wear it for more attention.  
c) They wear it to maintain power over own preservation of self.  
2) The video was a critical view of the ideology of "make-up", it raises the
question of why do some feminists still wear make-up.  
a) The video offered several conclusions to this question. One of them being
because advertising for make-up products is directed towards to fear of looks.
So much emphasis is placed on looks in our society that women are fearful of
not being externally attractive, and are mentally forced to buy make-up to
overcome this fear.  
b) Most women that wear make-up regularly do this as a result of succumbing to
the powers of societal norms. The rest of society is doing it so I probably
should too.  
c) Make-up is very time consuming and very expensive.  
QUESTIONS:  
Because of the fact that there are many different degrees with regards to the
feminist movement; liberal, radical, essentialist, don't you think that more
of their goals would be accomplished if they were all together fighting for
the same common goals for the whole movement?

USES AND GRATIFICATIONS  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) I believe that different people use the media in a variety of ways.  
a) Some people use the media to be informed on what is going on around the
world. To satisfy this need for information, people tend to either watch the
nightly news or read the daily new paper.  
b) Another use of the media, which is very poplar in our society, is the
showing of sporting events. People all over the nation tune in daily to watch
their teams go do battle with opposing teams. Every Sunday there are millions
of people watching the favorite football tams during the season. This also
creates a selective advertising scheme geared directly towards the male
viewer, with car and beer commercials heading the field.  
c) People also use the media for just pure entertainment. These people usually
are the ones who watch the comedies or the soap operas. There only use for the
media is to be entertained.  
2) In today's fast paced society there is a huge demand for programs for all
viewers to enjoy.  
a) Since there is a wide variety of viewers there needs to be a sow of channel
to encompass all of the viewers.  
b) The cable companies have responded to this need by developing more channels
for the viewers to choose from. They have everything from the cooking channel
down to CNN. This is very important concept for the cable companies because
they want to keep all the viewers happy, to keep that money flowing.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1) I feel that out of all the concepts or theories about media, the Uses and
Gratification model best portrays what is happening within our society.  
a) I think it really is a question of what do people do with the media, rather
than one of what does the media do for people.  
b) People use the media in a lot of different ways. Whether its for
entertainment or a social utility or a reality orientation or if its for
personal identity, all of these are ways in which people use the media to
satisfy their own needs.  
2) I also think that it is good that the media have to compete with one
another, this creates sort of a checks and balance system in the field.  
a) If the media did not have to compete then they would be allowed to get lazy
and do a half-assed job. With the competition all the different media have to
strive to be better or they will slowly fade out of the market.  
b) This also gives more power to the people. If a certain media is not
satisfying the needs of the audience, well then we just stop using the media
and use one that will satisfy our needs. That is what our society was built
on, "power to the people". That is the way it should be, power in the peoples
hands not the medias.

SEMIOTICS AND AMERICAN CULTURE  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I believe that TV programming and films were harmless toys that were
consumed by the American public to pass the time between work and sleep.  
a. I would watch. and sometimes still do, TV or a film strictly for its
entertainment value, and never consider the implications . or symbols, the
program spat at me.  
b. The way this act impacted me is that it made me nothing more than a
zombified couch potato and a potential target to receive other's ideas in a
passive light! It also sent me into numerous debates with my mother and
various others, as to what messages were being sent to our youth and adult
public in general. I, of course--the defender of the First Amendment that I
am, stated that the public was not dramatically influenced by these media, but
were free thinking individuals capable of coming up with their own ideas.  
c. Since I've been in this class, I believe I may have to modify my claim a
bit. I am not sure if it was that I never gave thought to the idea of
semiotics in these media, or that it had never occurred to me that " they,"
the producers of my favorite shows were slipping a few signs and symbols in
here and there. Nevertheless, after last Week's lecture and the Simpsons short
that we viewed. I realized that I was definitely in the wrong.  
2\. I never fully understood the controversy surrounding events such the
burning of the American flag.  
a. I mean I understood what the flag represents, but after all it is just a
piece of red, white and blue colored cloth. The ideas and views expressed by
the flag could never die in a flame.  
b. This thought had a definite impact on my life, especially through my
father's viewpoint (or was it his loud voice expressing disgust at my angle?).
My father, a W. W. II veteran, had a totally different take on what the flag
meant to him, and consequently, his family. This I understood and could
except, but one experience that I couldn't was my involvement in [in the
government participation program] during my Junior year in high school, which
was also the height of the flag burning controversy. This program was, in
theory, an opportunity for boys to learn about the running of local and state
governments. I soon felt though, that this program became a brainwashing event
for military recruiters and the American Legion, who sponsored the event. You
may ask yourself why I felt this way and all I can offer is this-- when the
Pledge of Allegiance becomes a religious experience to hundreds of sixteen and
seventeen year old boys, many of whom were in tears, you have to question it.  
c. I am not so sure that my feelings about the right to burn the flag has been
settled, but after this class, at last I think that I understand why so many
feel as strongly as they do, or did, on this issue. I now understand that
patriotic themes and symbols are planted all around us -in the shows we watch,
the cars we drive, and even in the beer we drink! I feel more aware, at least,
that these symbols are there and they do influence us in certain ways.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I am learning how culture feeds symbols that we get from our viewing
habits.  
a. & b. For instance, the Simpsons short that we watched really amazed me and
made me realize that we as a culture set the "norms" that Lisa was trying so
hard to fight.  
c. I think that this revelation is in fact making me a more critical viewer of
all the media I consume. especially commercials and their portrayal of women
and sex.  
2\. I am also learning how semiotics can develop myth, and used by some to
develop a particular viewpoint.  
a. No real big revelation here, but it was an interesting example of the
Algerian soldier to illustrate myth.  
b. Again, it was the example of the Algerian soldier.  
c. It will affect me in that I will be more critical of the claims by our
government ( and possibly the American Legion), especially when they are
telling the public of our justified involvement in a foreign affair.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
The only question or confusion that I have is regarding the concept of
paradigms in semiotics. Is it strictly a way of dividing signs ? Is the way
differentiate between what the symbols are in a word and the meaning assigned
to the word?

MARRIAGE -- AN OUTDATED RITUAL?  
BEFORE, THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I believed that marriage was a custom that was outdated and unwarranted in
modern society.  
a. I looked around me and saw couples committing to each other, without this
ceremony, who loved each other just as much as those who had been married.  
b. This impacted my life in that I couldn't understand what the big deal about
this simple, ancient, ritual was and I could not understand why there was a
controversy with people living together out of wedlock.  
c. Since I've been in class, my feelings have not changed considerably, but I
know now how culture, semiotics, an even the media play an important role in
illustrating the seeming importance in this ritual. The impact of this
realization though, has sharpened my awareness to things that I normally just
took for granted or ignored.  
2\. I wondered why and how marriage [could so dominate a society] that consist
of so many diverse groups that can not take part in what is considers
"marriage."  
a. Everyday, you hear how marriage is discriminatory to gays and lesbians who
want to make a lifelong commitment to each other. I tend to agree that it is
wrong that the law, as well as society, does not see it fit that these couples
cannot be joined in a ceremony and not recognized as a married couple.  
b. This particular issue did not directly affect me, but I did see it happen
to several of my friends. The pain and humiliation that this thinking caused
them was almost unbearable. This same mentality also affected me in that
society did not see that living with my girlfriend (now ex) was a legitimate
commitment are socially acceptable to some.  
c. Since I've been in this class, my feelings on this matter definitely have
not changed, and if anything have been strengthened. I think it is time that
society should resist the dictations of an old culture, and adopt a ceremony,
or include these into the present ceremony.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
a. I think I expressed in the previous text how this present ritual has
connected to my life. I have seen its effects on my friends, and the belief on
living together out of wedlock in my own experiences.  
b. What lead me to see this ritual for what it is, was the lectures and
readings in this class. I saw how the economy feeds this belief in that a man
and a women need to be married to be complete and to function properly
financially in society's eyes. I also see how our customs and media influence
this ritual of marriage.  
c. I think that I will not be so quick to judge today's world. I also will
respect any commitment made by a couple and honor it, regardless of whether a
ritual says it is justified or not!

CULTURE  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I assumed that culture was merely a minority issue.  
a. I worked with a woman who was Chinese and her husband was African American.
She talked about her children losing both of their cultures. I assumed that
since I don't have one specific nationality that I didn't have a culture.  
b. Yes, I felt like I was missing something because I wasn't in touch with my
heritage like those around me are.  
c. My assumption has been altered because I learned that there are many
definitions of culture besides the definition of national identity.  
2\. I also assumed that "culture" was used to describe a highly educated
person who attended ballet and opera. Someone who was really wealthy.  
a. I'm not sure if there were any single events that caused me to feel this
way. As a child I remember thinking this, I probably got the idea from my
parents.  
b. I remember talking my mother into getting tickets for the opera and
pretending I thoroughly enjoyed it so that we could increase our cultural
awareness.  
c. I've learned that high art is only a small part of material culture.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I learned there are many facets to culture besides the traditional ones.
For example, high culture, anthropology definitions, ethnic and national
definitions. Culture also involves the study of activities and interactions.  
a. Culture surrounds us everywhere. Anthropologists say culture is everything
we do in our everyday lives.  
b. The book "Questioning the Media" devoted it's entire first chapter to the
definition of culture. Our first lecture also discussed the definition of
culture. The argument in the first chapter was about the different senses of
the word culture and how they're tied to social and political viewpoints.  
c. I think the new ways to look at culture are going to allow me to expand my
knowledge of the world around me and help me to better understand it.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS Ideology confused me when I read about it in
the book. If I'm to understand it correctly all ideologies cover up the truth.
Then when i reviewed my class notes they said an ideology is a world view or
philosophy. In general, I found chapter one easy to understand .

THREE PRODUCTIONS  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I didn't have opinions about the mode of production although I understood
that the US is an industrialized nation and that the rich own the companies
and the poorer people work in them.  
a. Society must have shown me this but possibly my parents helped. A good
friend of my fathers owned the company my father works for. The friend sold it
for several million dollars.  
b. Not really except my father was very concerned with making the most money
he could.  
c. I see that economics is not a simple thing. Base and superstructure are
closely related to the three productions. It was interesting to see the impact
a few wealthy people have on the population through TV, radio, fashion etc.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. 1 learned there is a lot more to the ways of the economy besides just
owners and consumers. We are affected in almost every facet of our lives from
paper thin models to the "coolest" cars on the market.  
a. My new thoughts show me the reason for why I want to buy that certain brand
of shampoo or lose those unwanted pounds.  
b. This new thought came from learning about the mode of production and its
relations to base.  
c. I think I will listen to radio, watch TV and observe advertising in a whole
new way.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
I'm confused about the social psychology and how it relates to critical
theory. I understand that an individual is used to interpret the group but how
does social Psvcholoay relate to it?

THREE SIGNS  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I never really thought consciously about Icon, Index or Symbol. I know
that I recognized they exist because my father used to take me for walks in
the woods and show me footprints belonging to a deer and that let us know that
the letters d e e r corresponded to that traditional big brown eyed animal I
saw in the movie Bambi.  
a. I think my father taught me about deer but I never understood the picture
of a deer in Bambi to be the Icon, the footprints to be the Index and the
letters d e e r to be the symbol.  
b. Although I didn't know that I knew what these three things were knowing
them gave my the ability to understand things and how they relate to each
other.  
c. I think the knowledge of Icon, Index and Symbol show me that the
relationship between each of these is arbitrary.  
AFTER: NEWTHOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. In the reading "Semiotics and Television" by Ellen Seiter, the author
mentioned the fact that since these relationships are arbitrary, learning
foreign languages can be difficult.  
a. This fact gave me renewed hope that my difficulties in learning French
aren't all my fault. There is hope!  
b. The reading "Semiotics and Television" by Ellen Seiter lead me to this
feeling and also the lecture on Peirce's three kinds of signs.  
c. It gives a new perspective on language and the relationship between Icon,
Index and Symbol and how those relate in our everyday lives.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS The problem with turning in a reaction paper
the day of an exam is that any questions one has should have been answered
before the exam. With that in mind here is my question. In the lecture we
learned that Peirce defines signs in a way that resembles Saussure except that
he brings up the representament and the interprent. I don't remember seeing
these in the text. Is the representament the actual thing in the world that
the icon, index or symbol refer to?

BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Whenever I heard the word ritual I thought of a group of people like
witches having some kind of a gathering.  
a. I think I watched to many horror films when I was a kid. Every Saturday
night I'd watch Bob Wilkins double feature horror films.  
b. I don't think it really effected my life very much.  
c. This thought has been eliminated from my way of thinking since taking this
class. I have learned that a ritual can be just about anything that is a
routine or a habit like baptism or a rival football game.  
2\. I also thought that a ritual could be a habitual action.  
a. I must have learned it in school somewhere. Or for example, we habitually
visit our family in Ohio every 4 years. (I'm originally from the western US)  
b. No real impact that I can see.  
c. A ritual is not such a limiting thing as a habitual action.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The definition that was given in class read that a ritual is any
routinized and repeated speech acts, gestures, or other behaviors that
presuppose the existence of "others" or as enactments of roles can be taken as
signs of affinity or estrangement. This definitely rules out the idea of witch
gathering around a fire casting spells on people.  
a. This new definition of ritual helps me to see things in society in a
different way. Helps me to re- evaluate those things I just took for granted.  
b. The lecture on Thursday May 11, 1995 lead me to this idea of ritual.  
c. I hope I can start seeing things with a different set of glasses.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
We only had about half a lecture on Thursday with the exam that was on
Tuesday. There wasn't a reading for this week so consequently I don't really
have a question for this reaction paper. I realize this question is going to
be rather stupid but I'll ask it anyway. Does a ritual have to be a repeated
action?

LIMINALITY  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1.Before entering this class I did not know what liminality was, although I
did know of such things as rites of passage. However liminality is only a part
of the phase of a rite of passage.  
a. Watching documentary shows on public T.V. taught me that many African
tribes have rites of passage from childhood into adulthood.  
b. Having knowledge of other cultures improves the quality of my life and
makes me less ethnocentric. This I believe is very important.  
c. This feeling has been changed because now I can apply this idea to other
areas of my life.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I now realize that liminality is the phase which changes the individual.
You aren't what you were and are not yet what you will become.  
a. This new idea allows me to put a name to a phase that I never thought much
about before.  
b. Talking about the Rocky Horror Picture Show helped me to see this idea.
I've been to the show several times and had a friend who performed in front of
the audience but that's all I saw it as.  
c. I think I will be able to evaluate things better and not just take
everything at face value.  
2\. I realize that there are a variety of liminal phases that exist.  
a. Allows me to see things in a new light.  
b. The discussions we had and the examples that were given in class. For
example marriage, pregnancy and barmitzvah can all be considered liminal
phases.  
c. I will have the tools to examine things in my life as changes.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
I understand antistructure as mocking the establishment. What exactly would be
an example of an antistructure? Sit ins in the 60's? Do we always need
antistructure to break the old structure in order to get a new structure? or
do new structures suddenly appear?

MASS MEDIA AND OUR ROLES AS AN AUDIENCE  
BEFORE: THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Audience can be deemed active or passive  
a. I feel as though I fit into the active realm of an audience.  
b. Yes, I feel it is very important for individuals who compromise the
audience to take the time to interpret their own messages from the information
that the media delivers. c. My feelings have been confirmed by realizing the
importance of the public controlling the media rather than the media
controlling the public. It is obvious that mass media plays a role in "our
everyday lives".  
2\. We are surrounded by media more than we think.  
a. By the flip of a channel, turn of a page, or twist of the dial, Americans
are being overwhelmed by the media and its messages everyday.  
b. Yes, because these are things that go unrecognized and impact our lives
without even knowing it.  
c. My feelings have changed, basically because the information which I now
know concerning the audience and mass media has acted as a wake-up call.  
AFTER: NEW THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I learned how the audience functions in many ways.  
a. The audience is compromised of many different and diverse backgrounds. This
may explain the different appeals and targeting techniques used towards the
audience.  
b. By reading chapter ten and examining approach of "uses and gratifications"
has opened many doors to understanding the role of the media and the audience.  
c. I feel I'm only impacted by way of becoming a more aware and informed
audience member.  
2\. I learned how the media is linked to appealing to the members of the
audience by "uses and gratifications".  
a. The media realizes that the audience members have different expectations,
which may explain the categories within " uses and gratifications".  
b. The analyzation of needs and reasons for use lead me to think this.  
c. Same as before, feel as though I'm an aware and informed andience member.

ROCK AND ROMANCE  
BEFORE: THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. How music influences and effects our society  
a. Music does effect large audiences and often seems to convey negative and
positive messages.  
b. Music is basically another market which targets particular audiences, such
as the youth of today. c. Music influences our social and political factors
which can contribute to the success or failure of a record/song  
d. This particular section seems as though it would focus to the many
different cultures which can be reached through music by means of another mass
form of communications, which is music.  
AFTER: NEW THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
2\. What exactly the music industry wants and is trying to portray to its many
audiences.  
a. Elvis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry opened the door to a wide range of
music variety or contributed "to the world in giving music space (p.310)  
b. Music is more then just a favorite pastime, but a form of mass
communication which is used to communicate with large groups of people the ups
and downs which different societies encounter on a daily bases.  
c. Musicians are now given more freedom in the music they write and the
audience they are trying to reach  
d. This particular section in the book seems to be focusing on the current
music industry and how new ideas and styles are creating the current musical
trends. Musical trends are currently growing and changing, but yet contribute
and generate new musical sounds which are able to reach a large variety of
people and cultures.  
COMMENTS  
Music is one form of communications which is universal and virtually appeals
to all audiences. Music today is influenced by sounds past and present and is
a representational form of art which artists use to express their ideas and
experiences. There is a tendency to limit communications in the sense of just
talking, but music is widespread and seems to be taking the world by storm.

DOES SEX SELL IN THE MEDIA  
BEFORE: THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Commercials/Ads which place women in inferior positions in order to sell
certain products.  
a. Every time you turn on the t.v. a woman is shown half-naked or portraying
"susie homemaker".  
b. Commercials seem to be targeted towards men. Why? Because they're the
majority.  
c. It's infuriating to think that positive images cannot always ho ; 1 1
llstrated to sell a Droduct.  
2\. Will equality ever be met?  
a. Equality will never be met as long as women are shown halfnaked while men
are always being portrayed as the power structures.  
b. Yes, women are now in the work-place and aren't always walking around in a
swimsuits trying to entice a group of guys drinking beer.  
c. Men need to be shown in inferior positions, so that they can see how
degrading it is for a women and recognize that they are contributing to the
divisions within our society  
AFTER: NEW THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Going beyond the obvious with commercials and ads  
a. It never really dawned on me the sexual overtones which commercials have
that primarily target the male audience.  
b. I learned that it is not just beer and liquor commercials that live by the
motto "sex sells", but cosmetics and clothing advertisers as well.  
c. As a consumer I think it's really sad that as a society we have been
reduced to using sex to sell products.  
2\. I believe that there is hope for change.  
a. Yes, I do believe that there is other ways of advertising, but I see
marketing not changing as long as there is a demand.  
b. Considering that I plan to major in public relations/ marketing, I may be
the one voice who will assist in the advancement of change within marketing.  
c. Maybe the change should also involve having half-naked mon snstosd of women
and see how well the product sells.  
COMMENTS  
As a woman I find it very offensive to see women being portrayed as sex
objects and happy homemakers all the time. The male dominated industry fails
to see or portray the dynamic sides of women which we all possess by
constantly portraying women in such inferior positions. Society does not have
to be reduced to this, so why do it? Whether men chose to believe it or not
behind every great man stands a woman, and we shouldn't lose sight of this.

THE STUDY OF RITUALS  
BEFORE: THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Examining thoughts on rituals  
a. Rituals in my opinion have always been viewed as actions which are
performed in a particular way and at a certain time.  
b. I believe everyone engages in some sort of ritual.  
c. Rituals may often be determined and developed by one's race, sex, class,
and environment.  
2\. Too much importance and expectations are often placed on rituals.  
a. I feel as though individuals can be trapped into repeating the same actions
and will not allow for change or difference.  
b. Yes, because rituals seem to set a boundary for compromise and one should
never limit themselves.  
c. My feelings have been strengthened solely on the principles of how many
studentBs appeared to have rituals and were set on them occurring at a set
time.  
AFTER: NEW THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Varied factor effecting rituals.  
a. I learned that the term ritual can be interpreted from many different
angles (time, space, object, etc.)  
b. I not only came to this conclusion from the standpoint of class discussion,
but also by reading Beginnings in Ritual Studies, which as a reader forced me
to look deeper.  
c It forces one to look beyond the obvious when interpreting and analyzing the
term ritual.  
2\. I learned how rituals effect the lifestyle of those in New Mexico
(Fiesta).  
a. After reading this particular article it only supports my point which I
made earlier on how different cultures engage in varied rituals  
b. It was each factor which played in the development of rituals- time, space,
objects, sound, language, identity, and action where emphasis was placed on
these particular factors which were demonstrated through different aspects in
the fiesta held in New Mexico.  
c. Hopefully some of the information that I have encountered will help me to
re-think how rituals effect my life and how it goes beyond an action performed
at a particular time. Beginnings in Ritual Studies has opened my eyes and
helped me to look deeper and find the significance of the word ritual (like
race, class, sex)

FEMINIST'S VIEW  
BEFORE: THOUHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1.Thoughts concerning the feminist's perspectives on popular culture and how
effective it is towards progress.  
a. The feminist perspective appears to involve women's liberation on
particular issues and their influence on popular culture.  
b. This could impact me by means of helping and supporting the advancement of
African-American women within the social structure  
c. My feelings have not changed and probably never will until there is some
sign of advancement among women and especially women of color. Women have
always been placed at the end of the totem pole and women are now striving to
reach a level of equality among themselves and men as well.  
2.The unknown about women's representation  
a. Women are usually exploited or placed in inferior positions when portrayed
in commercials, TV shows, movies, etc.  
b. I feel that portraying women in such ways, sends mixed messages and
stereotypical images to society and our children.  
c. My feelings have not changed and won't until media and society take a
different approach towards representing women.  
AFTER: NEW THOHGTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1.I learned that the representation of women cannot only help them, but hurt
them as well  
a. This connects to my life because the feminist movement is suppose to work
for all women, but yet only includes white, middle class, passive, domestic,
and pretty women. This creates a problem and division among women when they
are suppose to be fighting for the same cause, but are forgotten because they
do not fit into classifications listed above.  
b. I was lead to believe this because of how the author explores all angles of
feminism and to who it appeals to.  
c. I hope that feminism will create or establish equality among women, so that
it may also be passed on between men and women, which is fundamental not only
by race, but by society as well.  
2.I learned the importance of acknowledging the contributions of women.  
a. I feel as though if attention is brought to women's achievement's then this
sets the foundation and poses role models for younger girl's and women.  
b. The author devotes a section to acknowledge women's creative efforts" which
are numerous, but are overlooked and unacknowledged.  
c. It makes me feel good as a young African-American woman to know that there
are individuals to help with the advancement of women and women of color.

THE EVER GROWING WEB  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The internet, information super highway, and world wide WEB have all
become buzz words in the media.  
a. I hear the terms mentioned everywhere. You can't watch a news commentary on
something without an internet email address being listed at the bottom of the
screen afterwards asking for comments.  
b. I believe so, but indirectly. The increase in the mention of these words
has caused the internet to grow at an even faster rate than ever before. So by
consequence I have more sights to get information from.  
c. This class has made me wonder how the internet will continue to grow. Will
outside influence from business and the media shape how the internet grows as
it shaped how television, radio, and the newspaper have grown, or is it so
large already that these influences will not affect it as much as they have
affected the others?  
2\. The internet is becoming increasingly commercialized over the past couple
of years.  
a. If you look around on the WEB, you'll find sights with information on most
of it, but adds of all sorts on the bottom of the pages, and some of these
sights are now starting to charge to access the information which is on them.  
b. The adds didn't really bother me, but the fees upset me a little since I
always thought of the internet as a free place to post and get information.  
c. Actually the class has made me think of creating some "flak" for The San
Jose Mercury Times, which is my particular source of information that I am
describing. Therefore, I think I will send them email on the matter, I might
even post something on a newsgroup suggesting that others do the same.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I learned what economic pressures may cause.  
a. The evolution of the internet will determine what kinds of things are
accessible to me on it.  
b. The lecture on the 5 filters the News led me to this thought.  
c. If an opportunity arises for me to possibly help shape what might happen to
the internet, I am more likely to take such actions. eg. As stated above in
the Before 2c.  
2\. In my opinion I believe the internet has a good chance of escaping the
effects of commercialization because of its already enormous size. Currently
it is primarily funded by those who pay to get connected. And these are mostly
universities and research facilities around the world.  
a. As long as these are the organizations that control the internet, I believe
it will stay mostly unrestricted and free usage if you can get connected:
however, if this changes the internet may gradually change to a communications
medium more like TV, Radio, and the Newspapers.  
b. The reading on the 5 filters of the News.  
c. Similar to that of the previous thought.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONCLUSIONS  
Can't think of any right now.

THE LAW OF THE LAND  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The extent by which Lawyers have control over writing and interpretation
of our written Law has disturbed me.  
a. I've looked at law books and contracts, and noticed that the law is written
in a form not very readable by the average person, and it disturbs me that I
need an interpretation of the law's to look up something as simple as housing
codes.  
b. Yes, I had some landlord problems last year, and I wanted to know exactly
what their obligations are and what I could do about it if they fail to meet
their obligations. It angered me that I couldn't just look at the laws and
understand them. I had to go to a reference that interpreted them.  
c. The class has strengthened my anger a little now that I see that those who
can read and understand the law well have a great deal of power over those who
can only ask them what it says.  
2\. I'm disgusted when Law's are brought out of context and used for things
that they were not originally intended to be used for.  
a. The recent addition to the Drunk Driving Laws that can prosecute a person
under 21 for DUI if they have over a .02% blood alcohol level. A person isn't
impaired to much to drive a vehicle if they only have a .02% blood alcohol
level. The Law is out of context, it's used for the wrong purpose.  
b. The particular example above hasn't affected my life, but I don't like it
because if they get away with this one, what will the next addendum be? Where
is the line drawn?  
c. My anger is lessened a little, since in class we learned that writing can
have this affect.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The Law is written in a special way to attempt to only allow one
interpretation for the Law, the writers.  
a. I realize that the system's not perfect and the writer doesn't always do a
perfect job, but they could probably make it a little easier, if they would
completely rewrite laws sometimes rather than adding large amounts of
addendum.  
b. The section of the book that talks about how writing in the middle ages
affected society, those who could read had power over those who couldn't.  
c. I'm still upset, but I don't really know of a better way. It would probably
better if interpretations were more easily found. Perhaps the WEB or some
other form of new electronic medium will supply this in the future.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
I'm a little confused as to the differences between the communication
cultures, especially the differences between oral culture and electronic
medium.

THE BIG TOW, ONE  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Before turning 21, alcohol consumption did not feel acceptable when I was
around parents or other older adults, although it seemed perfectly acceptable
while around my peers.  
a. Family events and parties I went to with friends led me to feel this way.  
b. Yes, I felt uncomfortable any time the subject matter came up around my
parents.  
c. This thought has pretty much remained unchanged since I entered this class.
This will probably lead me to attempt to tell my children how I feel about
subject matters as this one. A great deal of my discomfort was because I
didn't know exactly what my parents thought about alcohol other than they
drink on occasion.  
2\. After turning 21, I still felt a little uncomfortable for a month or so,
but I quickly seemed to adapt as though It had been acceptable for me to drink
for ages. The way I drank even changed. Now, I probably drink a little more
often than I did before I was 21; however, I drink much less per sitting than
I did before turning 21.  
a. Family events and social occasions outside the family occurring after
turning 21.  
b. Yes, I'm now more comfortable with the subject around family members, and I
think I understand why countries without age limits for drinking have fewer
problems.  
c. Yes, strengthened some because of the lectures on rituals and liminality I
have thought about the subject matter more. This probably strengthen the
impact from lc.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The process of turning 21 is a kind of liminal experience. Beforehand,
your in a type of "boyhood" state. Then there is the 21st birthday bash, the
in betwixt state. Afterwards, drinking becomes socially acceptable among older
adults in general. However, while it is acceptable, it takes a little time
before the "manhood" state fully sinks in.  
a. It connects to my life through the two thoughts before entering the class.  
b. The lectures on rituals and liminal experiences, and the reading on Symbols
in Nbembu ritual led me to this thought.  
c. This thought will cause me to analyze some of the events in my life. I may
not let societal pressures influence me quite as much. I'm sure they still
will, but maybe not without me analyzing them a little first.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
None at the present time.

RITUAL WRITING  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. Paper Writing is a Ritual for me, especially reaction type papers. First,
I dwell on possible ideas to write on. Then I probe a few sources to narrow
the idea's down and possibly come up with a new one. I pick one and write out
a short outline by hand. Then, I sit down and begin typing, letting my
thoughts and feelings flow naturally. Next, I read it over once and check for
grammatical errors, run the spell check - this may take a few minutes.
Finally, I print out the paper and turn it in. Occasionally I'll get a few
hours sleep during the last stage.  
a. All the reaction type papers I wrote in religion classes throughout high
school.  
b. Yes, This ritual allows me to communicate my thoughts and ideas well on the
subject matter I'm writing about.  
c. The class has strengthened this thought. I like my method of writing, and
it works for me. The reaction papers in this class disrupt my writing ritual,
and I don't feel my papers are as good.  
2\. Changing my ritual writing format results in my thoughts not flowing as
well, my ideas don't seem to come across as clear, and the assignment tends to
take longer.  
a. English 110 forced me to write multiple rough drafts, and I thought that
always screwed up the flow of my papers. In an attempt to make them more
suave, I messed them up.  
b. Yes, I believe the quality of my writing suffers when I am forced to change
my ritual writing format.  
c. Strengthened, same reasons as first thought.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I learned in class that a ritual presupposes the existence of "others".
That statement made me think about why my writing process is a ritual. Before,
I felt it was, but I didn't know why. It's because my writing is a process in
which I communicate ideas to "others".  
a. I have found that the more my ritual writing process is forced to be
altered, the more my ideas I want to get across suffer.  
b. The process of writing reaction papers in this courses strict format. I
find myself attempting to follow my ritual format, and then adding two steps.
One, I always complain about the format for a few minutes, then I attempt to
translate my format into the classes format. Only the transition doesn't ever
come out as clear.  
c. In the future, I plan to express my concerns to whomever is causing me ta
change my ritual writing format and express my concerns.  
QUESTIONS, CONCERNS, CONFUSIONS  
I'm still a little confused as to the exact definition of a ritual. The
multiple definitions given in class are a little hard to follow, and the first
reading assignment didn't help out very much. The next lecture on this subject
may clarify the meaning though.

WATCHING TV AGAIN  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. When I'm on co-op every other quarter, I seem to watch TV after work when
I'm tired and/or a little bored. I tend to watch mostly comedy where you don't
need to pay a great deal of attention to understand what's going on. At least
half the time I wind up falling asleep on the couch.  
a. My life on co-op in Dayton I tend to watch TV more in the winter,
especially if my roommates don't become friends of mine.  
b. The more often I was bored, the more often I seemed to watch television. I
have noticed that I don't watch any television program religiously, and If
someone else asks me to do something else, the television will lose 99% of the
time.  
c. The article on the TV audience confirmed that many people watch TV for this
reason. I don't think this revelation will have any impact on me though.  
2\. When I'm in school I watch Television for a different reason. It mostly
acts as background noise for me while I'm doing something else - homework,
cleaning, or socializing.  
a. My Television watching habits at school.  
b. The Television seems to be on a lot when I'm home, usually on the cartoon
network. It's on quite often, so I'm sure the experience affects me, I'm just
not sure exactly how.  
c. Same answer as 1c.  
AFTER: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. The two pieces of reading material on the TV audience experience have led
me to notice some of televisions affects on me. News shows in particular such
as Dateline NBC always make me think about the topics they discuss. I don't
always agree with what they say, and after taking this class, sometimes I even
wonder why they discuss a topic in a particular fashion.  
a. Television is a part of my life, it always affects me. It affects me when I
watch it, and indirectly it affects people that affect me when they watch
television.  
b. As I mentioned above, the two pieces of reading material on the TV audience
experience were the primary reasons for this thought.  
c. This thought will cause me to think more about what is on television and
why. Television will always affect me, but now I realize It affects me more
than I thought it did.

None at this time.

SEXUAL CONNOTATIONS IN ADVERTIZING  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I had always noticed sexual connotations in advertisements, but never
understood the impact they had on people.  
a. In the past few years, I have paid more attention to the meaning behind
advertisements as a result of classes I have taken, (i.e. Women's Studies).  
b. It impacted me a little. I would occasionally become angry because I felt
that the portrayal of women was usually very demeaning.  
c. This feeling has become stronger as a result of reading the article, Sex,
Sin, and Suggestion", in the packet.  
2\. I had not considered that these types of advertisements were so
influential in people's lives.  
a. I do not let these advertisements affect me, (consciously, anyway), so I
did not assume that they impacted other people as seriously as the article
suggests.  
b. It did not impact my life as a far as I know. I do not believe that I have
ever made a decision about my life because an advertisement has suggested it.  
c. This idea that I have not been affected by advertising has turned into a
bit of a crusade. I feel that now that I have been educated quite extensively
about the goals of advertisers, I will be able to recognize these connotations
and, therefore, will not be tempted to either buy a product just because of
these connotations, or worse, to make a decision in my life that is
detrimental to my health or my reputation.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I now notice sexual connotations a lot more.  
a. I am almost paranoid now. Every time I see an advertisement, I think about
the meaning behind it, and if it seems to not have anything wrong with it, I
usuallyjust make something up!  
b. The article, aSex, Sin, and Suggestion", has lead me to this new attitude.  
c. I don't think this is a negative attitude. For me, if an advertisement can
market a product without using sex, it deserves more credit.  
2\. I am more fearful of the permanent effects these ads will have on young
people.  
a. The article had a good argument when associating the AIDS virus with these
ads. I also believe that sexual assault problems can be linked to advertising,
showing men it is aokay", to treat women poorly.  
b. I came to this feeling from reading about people who have developed
selfesteem problems because of sex in advertising.  
c. This new feeling will motivate me to do two things; first, I will not feel
jealousy toward women in advertisements. I have learned that they are not
typical of the American woman, and we spend too much time trying to live up to
that model. Second I will not make decisions that have been influenced by
advertising. I will never try to emulate a situation that is shown in
advertising, because those sit.uations are unrealistic and unsafe.

DEFINING FEMINISM  
BEFORE: THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. As a result of taking a women's studies class, I had a stereotypicai view
of a '1eminist".  
a. In dealing with the Women's Studies Department, I encountered a lot of
"radical" feminists who were mainly interested in male-bashing, and they
centered the term "feminism" around lesbianism.  
b. Yes, it impacted my life in a negative way, because I had always considered
myself to be a feminist, until I could not identify with what I was taught
feminism was. It is not to say that i was unaccepting W women in that
department, I had just always thought that feminism was more than, male-
bashing.  
c. This feeling has been eliminated since lecture on Tuesday. I understand now
that I was taught one aspect of feminism in women's studies, but not the whole
picture.  
2\. I did not think that a calm, rational discussion about feminism was
feasible.  
a. There was always that pompous male, all worked up about how feminists are
men-hating bitches, or the hippy woman chanting how women shouldn't shave
their armpits in order to impress men.  
b. It impacted me because I did not really learn anything about feminism.
usually just found myself in the middle of a heated argument.  
c. My feelings have changed, because I understand that there is more to learn
about feminism now that I can be involved in a calm discussion about it.  
AFTER: NEW THOUGHTS, OPINIONS, FEELINGS, CONCLUSIONS  
1\. I understand that the Women's Studies Department has a more radical view
than necessary.  
a. I can take a step back from it all now. I understand that my TA for women's
studies was probably just too eager to push her views onto he

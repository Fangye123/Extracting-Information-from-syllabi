**Objective:**  
  
The International Relations Concentration is an interdisciplinary program for
undergraduate students enrolled  
in any of the seven Cornell undergraduate colleges. The IR Concentration
provides a structured yet flexible  
program for undergraduates to take advantage of the vast resources available
at the university for studying the  
politics, economics, history, languages, and cultures of the countries and
regions of the world.  
  
Graduates of the program have gone on to pursue further education in fields
such as political science and  
anthropology and to successful careers in international law, economics,
agriculture, trade, finance, and  
government service, among others. They have worked in international and
nongovernmental organizations, in  
cross-cultural affairs, in journalism, and in education.  
  
The IR Concentration is not a major or a department, but rather a program
offering a selection of courses  
reaching across colleges and departments. Students pursue the International
Relations Concentration in addition  
to their regular degree. IR Concentrators have majored in fields ranging from
anthropology, city and regional  
planning, communications, government, and history to natural resources,
industrial and labor relations, and  
computer science. International coursework and language study add a global and
cross-cultural dimension to  
those majors. Some students even design an independent major in some aspect of
international relations or  
comparative social or cultural studies. Spending a semester or year of study
abroad can contribute to meeting the  
course requirements of the IR Concentration, including the language
requirement.  

![](sumhorsa.gif)

  
**Course Requirements:**  
  
These requirements are designed to expose students to a broad range of
perspectives in international  
relations while allowing them to tailor their course selections to specific
interests.  
  
Courses throughout the university are grouped into four subject areas:  
  
                        ***   International Economics and Development   
                        *  World Politics and Foreign Policy   
                        *  Transnational Processes and Policies   
                        *  Cultural Studies **  
  
Courses within these four subject areas are designated as "core" or
"elective." Students must complete  
eight courses selected from the four groups according to one of two
strategies. Option A emphasizes  
the politics and economics of international relations. Option B puts greater
stress on culture. In  
choosing either option, students should ensure that they acquire familiarity
with more than one  
geographic region or country.  
  
All courses used to fulfill the concentration requirements, including language
courses, must be taken for  
a letter grade.

_Option A:_

  * One core course from each group 
  * One elective from each group 

> _Option B:_  

  * One core course from each group 
  * One elective from either Group 1 or Group 2 
  * One elective from Group 3, one elective from Group 4, and one additional elective from either Group 3 or Group 4. 

Prior to pre-registration a course list for the following semester (as well as
lists for the current and  
previous semesters) can be obtained from the Administrative Coordinator, Hyeok
Yong Kwon, 156 Uris Hall [(hyk1@cornell.edu](mailto:\(hyk1@cornell.edu)) (tel.
254-5004).  
  

![](sumhorsa.gif)

  
**Language Requirements:**  
  
IR Concentrators are expected to complete additional language study beyond the
College of Arts and  
Sciences degree requirement of "proficiency." For most languages proficiency
is attained by completing  
a course at the 200 level, by which point the basic grammar and structure of
the language will have  
been covered. The IR Concentration requires students either to demonstrate
proficiency in two  
languages or to show facility with one language beyond proficiency (by taking
a course, following the  
basic grammar sequence, that uses the language to explore some aspect of a
foreign culture, such as  
literature or film). To summarize, the requirement can be fulfilled in one of
two ways:  
  
            *  Two foreign languages at proficiency, or    
            *  Two years of one foreign language (proficiency plus one course)   
  
All language courses must be taken for a letter grade.

**Study Abroad:**  
  
IR Concentrators are strongly encouraged to study abroad to bring a practical
dimension to their  
expertise in international issues. Those who choose this option will find the
requirements for the  
concentration highly compatible with courses taken abroad. To learn more about
programs available  
for study abroad, visit Cornell Abroad at 474 Uris Hall and consult the
website:  
[
http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/cuabroad](http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/cuabroad).
Students are encouraged to contact the Administrative  
Coordinator of the IR Concentration to discuss how their study abroad program
can help fulfill the  
concentration requirements.  

![](sumhorsa.gif)

  
**Enrollment:**  
  
Students may enroll in the International Relations Concentration at any point
but are encouraged to do  
so early in order to be put on the email list for announcements of news and
activities of the program.  
There is no penalty for withdrawing from or not completing the Concentration.
To enroll, please  
contact the Administrative Coordinator.

**Completion:**  
  
Transcripts will reflect successful completion of the requirements for the
concentration. In addition,  
students will receive a special certificate and a letter of confirmation
signed by the director of the  
International Relations Concentration.

The course list includes all of the core courses for each group [with brackets
around those not offered

semester. It is intended to  
be representative but not exhaustive. The program regularly updates the list
and is always willing to  
include new courses that fit within one of the four groups. Please take note
that some courses,  
especially in Group 1, have prerequisites, and others have limited enrollment.

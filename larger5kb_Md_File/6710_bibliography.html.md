> Easton, DF CR 41.1 ('91) 132-13: 1) Aryan names 1st appear in NE 17th-16th c
BC; Aryan conquest of India follows shortly after. IE chariot-terminology in
Greece ca 1600 BC suggests that invaders brought chariot. 2) This 16th c
dispersion of IE spkrs correlates with "takeovers" in NE: foreign rulers take
over without disturbance to subject population or material culture. IE
takeover also explains wealth of Shaft-Grave dynasty. 3) This C 17-16
dispersion correlates too with 1st spread of chariot warfare. Not with the
horse. 4) "A thin chain" of linguistic and cultural links may just be strong
enough to suggest that IE Hurrians, Kasites and Aryans were once neighbors
near Caucasis: just where Soviet scholars place PIE homeland, and where light
chariot was invented no earlier than 19th c.  
> IE names in Kultepe pd. in Anatolia, and early chariot warfare there by
Hyksos, possible dangers to RD's thesis, explained by RD 1) names were
infiltrated; 2) Hyksos used chariot 1st, this was model inspiring those
further E to conquest of advanced societies. Easton: 1) doesn't work well, and
RD doesn't explain why Hittites got chariot warfare first (2). An "explanatory
gap" that "matches a general tendency to lump Central Anatolia vaguely in with
East Anatolia, Armenia and Transcausia . . ." But still a "compelling" thesis,
relying on linguistic and historical evidence, "with the ambiguous evid. of
arch. rightly brough in only as ancillary."

`

`  
`chrisMorel [guest] has arrived.  
kimdl [guest] says, "Hi Chris"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "to Keith" it was the first one I have been to and it  
was so cool"`  
  
`LynnLS asks, "Does everybody understand about the picture problems we  
have been having on some of the webpages?"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "Stop avoiding me. When you gonna post your journal?  
I've got some honest opinions about it I want to  
share with the world!"`  
  
`chrisMorel [guest] says, "Hi Kim"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Meg]: "There is a college student here that is part of  
as many fo those reactments as he can fit in."`  
  
`MargaretCC exclaims, "I am sorry I ahve a a bit of a time I won't post  
until later tonight BUT let me say how much I liked  
yours!"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "These critiques could get intersting..."  
`  
`MistyD [to LynnLS]: "are we allowed to clip parts off of  other websites  
and use them on our own site or is that stealing  
pictures?"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "When you say clip parts - are you talking about  
pictures, text??"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Kim> It was really fascinating and I really was  
surprised by the authenticity that they strive for"`  
  
`MistyD says, "Pictures"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "Why, thank you. I think yours is topnotch. Of  
course, I wouldn't expect anything less from you"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "And my 3 & 6 year old were as fascinated"  
`  
`chrisMorel [guest] goes out.  
LynnLS [to Misty]: "you have to be very careful about using pictures`

`from other websites. Look for a disclaimer statement  
on the site - they ususally say "these pictures are  
free to use" or "you may use these pictures but you  
must include a link back to my page" or "you can't  
use these pictures""`  

`MargaretCC says, "<toKeith> I am currying favor you know...Did you try  
the seeds...link to the PDF doc Lea said it was taking  
forever to load"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "I went to a reenactment when I was about eight, and  
I think that was a major factor in how much I enjoy  
studying the Civil War now"`  
  
`MistyD says, "It is all confusing what is allowed and what is not"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "I asked the computer teacher at the community  
college about using the globe I did on my web  
site and she said it should be ok because they  
can prevent you from being able to take  
pictures off if they don't want you to use  
them"`  
  
`LynnLS exclaims, "It's interesting that you bring up the reenactment - a  
friend of mine in Louisiana is home schooling her son.  
She is an engineer by training and didn't have a clue  
about teaching history.  They began attending some of  
these and are now quite the experts!"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Keith> Well I am a D. Yankee and so we did not  
study the war up there as they do here BUT The  
country's history IS HERE in VA"`  
  
`Jim [guest] [to Lynn]: "Thanks for the e-mail on Saturday.  If I had  
heeded the advise I could have saved myself a lot  
of grief."`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] has arrived.  
LeonardN [to Meg]: "No, I haven't tried all of your links & stuff. I've`

`been looking at all of them and I've been trying to  
narrow down which ones I was going to critique. I  
hope Diane puts hers up pretty soon. I'm anxious to  
see it"`  

`Lea [guest] arrives from nowhere.  
Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "I took quite a bit of time looking through`

`graphics.  All of the ones I found said  
whether you could or could not use them."`  

`kimdl [guest] exclaims, "Hi Lea!"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "<to LYNN & Keith> That what I am saying noe that I am  
here I really have enjjoyed learning all that there is  
about the Civil War"`  
  
`MistyD [to LynnLS]: "are we supposed to critique the journals as well as  
the webpages, or just the webpages"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Jim [guest]]: "No problem - I was trying to get caught up  
since I didn't have great access at the  
conference!"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "HI Lea"  
`  
`Lea [guest] exclaims, "Hi everyone!"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Just critique the webpages, not the journal"  
`  
`LeonardN [to You]: "D. Yankees put a serious whoopin' on us. (Don't tell  
anybody, but I'm a Yankee, too)"`  
  
`MistyD [to Kimdl [guest]]: "I just cut and pasted mine.  I never saw  
anything on the site that said otherwise"`  
  
`Jim [guest] says, "Now that Lea is on line I want to thank her.  My page  
probably still wouldn't be up except for her help."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Amanda]: "You did a great job moderating the TappedIn  
sessions while I was gone!"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "It's like they say - American by birth, Southern by  
the grace of God"`  
  
`MargaretCC asks, "oooh now thats a piece of Black mail material...where  
from?"`  
  
`AmandaKB [to Lynn]: "Thank you.  They were pretty light though."  
`  
`MistyD [to LynnLS]: "are we meeting next Sunday?"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "On the one I used they didn't say.  That's  
why I asked somebody."`  
  
`Jim [guest] says, "Nothing wrong with being a Yankee, just as long as  
your not a New York Yankee fan.  This is from a Boston  
native."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "I was born in Kansa"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "That's Kansas"  
`  
`Lea [guest] [to Meg]: "I would have been on time but Bryan was playing  
Blackjack and when I fussed at him he froze the  
computer."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "Youknow Virginian by birth I have two now or by  
marriage is a benediction from above..."`  
  
`MistyD [to Kimdl [guest]]: "when will you know how you did on your  
praxis test"`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "Lynn, I am ready to go back to the stone age  
with all of my computer problems. I am still  
having problems staying connected tonight."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Yes, I will be here - don't know how ya'll's (can  
you do that - put two apostrophes in one word??)  
spring breaks work out, but we will be meeting  
through the end of the semester now."`  
  
`EllenCa finds her way in.  
EllenCa's personal recorder follows EllenCa to here.  
EllenCa says, "Hello Everyone"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "Yes, you can except my spell check changed my ya'll to  
y'all"`  
  
`MistyD says, "Next sunday is Easter I did not know we  may go out of  
town"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "It's six weeks before they mail out the  
scores.  I should find out right about the  
time of final exams.  I stayed with the pen  
and paper test."`  
  
`Lea [guest] says, "Hi Ellen"  
`  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "Hello Ellen."  
`  
`kimdl [guest] exclaims, "Hi Ellen!"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Jim [guest]]: "Being from Boston is okay. It's people from  
New Jersey and Michigan that make me uneasy"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Lynn> as an not so private aside Thanks for all  
your understanding recently"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "If you can't make it on Sunday next week, then come on  
Thursday."`  
  
`MistyD [to LynnLS]: "that sentence did not make any sense"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Hi Chris do you want to stay in the same group with  
Leshia and I  if we have more assigments"`  
  
`MistyD says, "I have Physics lab You get a zero for lab if you miss"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Meg]: "Glad I could be of help.  As Chris and Jim have  
pointed out recently, this can be a trying class with  
the computer issues that sometimes are out of our  
control!"`  
  
`MargaretCC exclaims, "<to Keith> No, Conn and PA speaking of Conn GO  
LADY MONARCHS!!!"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "I would like to let you know in case anyone  
hasn't taken these things yet.  I thought  
Praxis I was much harder than Praxis II but  
Praxis II covered the broadest base of  
knowledge I've ever been tested on at one  
time."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "I was talking about TappedIn - some people may not  
make it next Sunday due to Easter."`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "Sounds great Ellen. But I have to warn you my  
computer has blown up twice and finally flew  
out the window to the curb for trash  
collection."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Lynn> Yes that is a very good lesson for all of us  
to carry with us...sometimes the "dog eats the  
homework""`  
  
`MistyD [to LynnLS]: "This class has taken so much of my time this  
semister, but I am amazes at what I can accomplish  
with a computer know"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Yea - go Lady Monarchs - they destroyed Kansas State -  
sorry Keith"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Meg]: "Actually my sister cut mine up one time to get  
me in trouble."`  
  
`MistyD says, "Sorry my typing is terrible tonight"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "My point exactly, sorry Keith"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Chris: Bad computer I understand I had the problem in the  
beginning of this class when we were designing web pages"`  
  
`BrianRH [to Lynn]: "Module 5 will be up tomorrow?"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "My Dad went to Kansas State, but I was only three  
days old went I left Kansas, so I don't remember a  
whole lot"`  
  
`MargaretCC asks, "<to Kim> did it work?"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Well, I'm glad you feel that your abilities with the  
computer are much better.  The only way to get better  
is to make all the mistakes - trust me I know!"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I agree with Misty about geting better."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Hard drive crashed"  
`  
`Jim [guest] [to Misty]: "I loved your flags.  Really caught my attention  
right away."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Meg]: "It would have if she hadn't left the shreds in  
my book so the teacher could obviously see I was  
telling the truth."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Brian]: "Yes, Module 5 will be up tomorrow - I've got to  
finish the overview (forgot my book for my notes).  
I'll link it tonight with a note about checking back  
for the final version so you can see what is  
involved."`  
  
`MistyD says, "My teacher I did it for is excited about her class having  
a website"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "Must be contagious Mine caught a fatal flaw on  
Friday..."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Ellen> that was for you oops"  
`  
`BrianRH says, "My CD ROM keeps crashing for some reason.  I replaced it  
in December but now it's on the blink again."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "I'm impressed that my teacher is actually  
going to use the thing because she really  
didn't want one."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Ellen> your site was really neat"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Kim]: "Now that's impressive!"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "As the semester continues, if your teachers are using the  
website and would like to continue doing so until June,  
please let me know so I won't erase the webpages until  
later in the summer."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "I heard there is a really bad worm out there and norton  
cant fix it"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Thanks Margaret----Like my humor."  
`  
`BrianRH exclaims, "Lynn, can you not erase mine?  It's for my tech.  
portpholio!!"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Ellen]: "Thanks for the warning"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "I haven't gotten a notice about that, but I don't  
doubt it.  I don't open ANY attachments that come  
from someone I don't know."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Brian]: "Will note that.."  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Ellen> did you know the print on your sitehas`

`shifted out of alignment? AND that might explain it"  
`

`EllenCa says, "I do not know where it comes from but it is the fed govt"  
`  
`MistyD says, "me too ellen I heard not to open any e-mail if it is  
labled microsoft upgrade"`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] asks, "Kim, you said praxis II was easier than praxis  
I?"`  
  
`BrianRH asks, "But, Lynn, I thinj it's out there anyway, right?"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "No I don't open alot of stuff even when it is from  
someone I know"`  
  
`BrianRH says, "When do we need to take Parxis II"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Brian]: "What is out there - sorry - I was writing about not  
erasing your webpage!"`  
  
`BrianRH says, "The webpage for where I teach."  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "How did you solve your harddrive problem?"  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "Especially when I am as dependent on it as I am for  
this or most of my other distance learning classes"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Rebuilt the computer and put in more hard drive.  Started  
from scratched"`  
  
`LeonardN asks, "to Meg Did you have any problem with the 680 midterm?"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "did you include more RAM - is the download time  
faster now?"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Ellen> Yikes"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Chris]: "I thought so.  I guess the real test is if I  
passed.  But seriously I was sitting there and  
I could tell you which class I learned that  
material in.  Science was biology, chemistry,  
physics, earth science/physicalscience.  I  
knew I know or ought to know everthing that  
was on there.  It just covered an amazing  
range of topics."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "We lost everything that was on the computer.  Our  
financial and taxe"`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to Keith> No I don't think so, but we'll know next  
week"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "Hope you filed your tax return already - what an  
ordeal to replicate!"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Brian]: "Anyone being licensed after 2002 has to take  
it before licensure."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Brian]: "I prefer to go ahead and get those type of  
things out of the wya."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I really did learn a lot with this last  
assignment."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Meg]: "Yeah, I'm kinda anxious to see my grade. I did well  
on the Assessment project and would really like to  
get an A in that class"`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] exclaims, "Thanks Kim!"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "No tax returns filled my husband is going crazy trying to  
get everything together. Especially having to file 3  
finacial aid packages"`  
  
`MistyD says, "I thought you had three years after you were licensed  If  
they need teachers why are they making it so difficult"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "I'm sure you can teach provisionally before  
passing the thing."`  
  
`BrianRH says, "Okay, everyone, I am going to logg off, unless there's  
anything I need to do (Lynn???)."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<to all> Hubby has cooked and is now pestering me to  
come to the dinner table  GTG  Thanks again Lynn is  
there any thing else I'll post my jounal later tonight"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "There were some interesting sessions at the conference I  
attended (teacher educators and technology - lots of geeky  
types -grin), but the most intesting ones were on inquiry  
learning.  Look for that term in the coming year."`  
  
`BrianRH says, ":)""  
`  
`MistyD [to Kimdl [guest]]: "I don't understand do they think colleges  
just give away degrees"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Meg]: "Nothing pressing - bye - what a nice hubby to cook for  
you - mine's in Blacksburg again.."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "same type as discovery learning?"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "Bye Brian"  
`  
`BrianRH has disconnected.  
kimdl [guest] says, "night Brian"  
`  
`Lea [guest] [to Keith]: "How do you know how you did on your assessments  
already?"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: ""Inquiry learning?" he asks."  
`  
`MargaretCC says, "Ah well, he's nmaking up for being away Yesterday and  
today"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lea [guest]]: "and Keith I got my assessments back but  
not the midterm."`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Inquiry learning is very similar to discovery learning,  
but can be done at several levels."`  
  
`MargaretCC says, "<Keith> how were they I missed that..."  
`  
`LeonardN [to Lea [guest]]: "everyone at my site has gotten theirs back,  
hope to get the midterm this week"`  
  
`Lea [guest] says, "We haven't gotten anything back at RCC."  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Keith]: "He said we ought to have it by Tuesday.  I  
hope so."`  
  
`LynnLS says, "inquiry learning can be something like "do this science  
experiment to verify that heat will speed up a reaction""`  
  
`MargaretCC has disconnected.  
LynnLS asks, "inquiry learning can also be done at a higher level where`

`the teacher would say "What happens when you add heat to a  
chemical reaction - how could we prove this?"`  

`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "so you can follow something like Bloom's with  
it?"`  
  
`leshia [guest] finds its way in.  
EllenCa says, "Lynn are you pleased with the curr. pages so far"  
`  
`LeonardN asks, "Has anyone else gotten the impression that Dr. Morgan is  
not a big fan of technology?"`  
  
`Jim [guest] asks, "to? Lynn  What is the difference between Inquiry and  
Hands-On?"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "hello everyone"  
`  
`kimdl [guest] exclaims, "Hi Leshia!"  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "hi kim"  
`  
`MistyD says, "Hi leshia"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "Yes, I've been very pleased with what I've seen so  
far - looking forward to everyone's finished`  
`product."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Hi Leshia I got your email and have not had a chance to  
check things out.  We just got back from Skyline Drive"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Keith]: "That is the only person I have handwritten  
stuff for in a century."`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "thanks ellen, I was a little confused."  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Keith]: "so I agree with you."  
`  
`MistyD [to EllenCa]: "have they opened skyline drive already?"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I really did have trouble with it changing my  
text on me."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "confustion and frustration seems to be my state of mind  
lately"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Kim]: "I feel a little bit sorry for Dr. Morgan the way  
everybody gives him a hard time every week."`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Inquiry is not only hands-on - it is the process for  
people to figure out why something happens - it may only  
take mental activity to do that.  Hands-on is usually a  
term referring to physically manipulating material."`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ellen, I understand..hang in there."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "no skyline drive opens next weekend"  
`  
`MistyD says, "What site are you at Ellen"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "but the trails are open all year long.  Just no bathrooms"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Misty:  Lord Fairfax Warrenton"  
`  
`MistyD says, "I need bathrooms"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Keith]: "We shouldn't give him a hard time.  We all do  
things that other people don't agree with."`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Keith]: "I think it's awful how they treat him and as  
someone told me he has the patience of a saint."`  
  
`MistyD [to EllanCa]: "I through about going there one semister It is the  
same distance for me to go there or germanna"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "At least the boys in the car can use a tree!!!!! but us  
girls well----"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ellen, I have always wanted to hike the  
Appalachain Trail, I know that some people have  
completed the entire trip.  I have done portions."`  
  
`MistyD [to EllenCa]: "is there a junior college there next to the site"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "I have done portions of the trail too.  I enjoy the  
country"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Ellen]: "I was the only girl who ran cross country in  
high school.  You might be surprised at what  
you can do."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Yes we attend in the junior college. ODU rents 2  
classrooms"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Ellen]: "I didn't realize that you're just up the  
valley."`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Kim]: "I agree I sold land for years and  it was usually  
30 min to nearest bathrm."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Kimdl==not after 4 kids and 50+years"  
`  
`MistyD says, "What is the name of the junior college because the  
geography I need Germanna only offers it at the  
Fredericksburgh campus an hour and a half away from me"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Kim]: "& Lea I enjoy Dr. Morgan's class as much as I enjoy  
this (plus five points for Keith) and I feel I'm  
really learning some useful stuff, just as with this  
class (another plus five points for Keith)."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Kim]: "Did the text change after you made changes to your  
page, or when you viewed it on a different size screen  
or different browser?"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ellen, Joy called me, I will send you an email  
address for a lady at odu.  She was very helpful  
with my transcript and combined classes to meet  
some requirements.  She actually found 4 classes on  
my schedule that I did not need."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Self grading - was that in my syllabus (grin)???"  
`  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "Goodnight everybody. I need to study for math  
and try and get my page up for the third time."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Leshia: I was thinking of making an appointment this week  
with someone at ODU to talk"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "No, they were just helpful suggestions"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "Bye chris"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "On a different size screen.  It is still  
currently all correct I believe on the copy  
that I have saved."`  
  
`leshia [guest] asks, "Hi Chris, How is your math going?"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Lynn who would be a good person at ODU to talk to about  
what classes to take and what we really need to finish  
quickly"`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Lynn]: "If flattery works I think you're a truly amazing  
person to put up with us."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Kim]: "That is normal for text to shift, but if you use table  
for all your work, the text may resize itself by line,  
but its relative position will stay the same."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Ellen]: "Dr. Leigh Butler was really helpful to me  
even though she is special ed."`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ellen, her name is Renee Olander, I am not sure of  
her title, she was very nice, and she was prompt"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Lea [guest]]: "Flattery and bribery - I live by them (smile)"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Ellen]: "She has helped me as well."  
`  
`LeonardN [to Ellen]: "That's the kind of thing your site director is  
supposed to help you with"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Yes, Renee is really a great person to work with."  
`  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "slow Leisha. I have spent to much time on  
trying to recreate all my work from this  
semester. To many computer problems."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Chris]: "What math are you in?"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Amanda]: "Is Renee your advisor?"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "I think Chris left."  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "Chris, I am with you in hat boat.  Did you get  
confused when with the review?  I thought I had it  
down until then."`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "Kim, I am in Math 300."  
`  
`AmandaKB [to Lynn]: "I usually talk to Lisa Fentress, but Renee is above  
her."`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Opps - sorry Chris - it was Brian..."  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Chris]: "I think it's rougher this semester than it  
was last spring when I took it."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Chris]: "Good luck"  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "Good night Chris and good luck..."  
`  
`MistyD says, "I loved our teacher in math 300 last spring he was so nice"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "That's ok.  Thanks."  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "He is the first math teacher I ever liked."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Chris are you leaving"  
`  
`ChrisMorel [guest] exclaims, "NO Lynn my computer is stuck on this site  
now. UGGHH!!"`  
  
`LynnLS says, "Ah Chris - and I thought it was that you really liked  
us..."`  
  
`MistyD [to ChrisMorel [guest]]: "maybe it just likes us"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "Geo 302 last semester was really good for me.  
currently i'm back in a traditionally taught`

`math class and am struggling again."  
`

`EllenCa says, "Chris and I thought we were friends"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Kim]: "How was the other math class taught - I assume not in  
a "traditional" manner?"`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Kim]: "Did you take Geo 302 teletechnet?"  
`  
`MistyD says, "kim what math are you taking now"  
`  
`ChrisMorel [guest] asks, "am trying. I think I can throw this computer  
about 25 feet now. I wonder if they will make  
that an olympic sport?"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ha Ha, See if you can estimate how far it will  
go...."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Chris]: "Maybe you could use it like the hammer throw, just  
call is the Computer Toss..."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I didn't think so.  Mrs.  Hutchinson made us  
participate in class.  She didn't assign tons  
of homework problems to collect.  she made us  
learn the vocab.  I don't know why math  
teachers keep the meanings of the words locked  
away in secret."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Chris]: "computer tossing is an Olympic sport now."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Chris:  I think we will all do well in Computer throws on  
some days"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Kim we have tons of homework, and the only  
assessment we have are 3 test and the exam"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Kim]: "What was the math course about - geometry, algebra,  
number theory...."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "don't laugh.  Liberal arts math.  but the`

`teacher assigns homewrok each class and then  
takes it up the next class so I don't have it  
to study."`  

`LeonardN exclaims, "I'm shocked! Your computer is your friend!"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "with Mrs. Hutchinson -geometry"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Leonard not when it crashes"  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "Natalie...."  
`  
`MistyD says, "I thought we only needed two math 300 and 302"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Sounds like a mantra we should all practice - maybe  
it would help..."`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "With friends like this computer I don't need  
anybody else."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Ellen]: "You should try and get in touch with the pain it  
is feeling, it will help you more once you do"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Misty, we need a stats class, I am taking stat 241  
at lfcc."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "chris what is this you don't need us to bug you"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "The reason I'm taking yet another math class  
is because I looked at the state requiements  
and they said we should have 12 credits in  
math,"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Kim]: "Yes, Geometry has so much vocabulary - but sometimes I  
found it got in the way of learning.  I let my  
student's have "cheat sheets" of formulas, and let them  
"draw" theorems instead of writing them out."`  
  
`MistyD says, "Is it below 300"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Leshia [guest]]: "I know I might be gettin in trouble  
by not bein gin stats."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "yes"  
`  
`MistyD says, "I have not had stats but i had a couple of calculus I hope  
I don't need anymore math"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "Yeah, Kinda like "Serenity now!""  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "Yes, it used to be 306, but apparently odu doesn't  
have any one to teach it, and we can take it at a  
community college"`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "You can bug me, but you might not get a  
response."`  
  
`leshia [guest] asks, "Chris, are we supposed to have any of those  
lattice problems on the test?"`  
  
`MistyD says, "Maybe one day I will graduate"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I complained about that class the entire  
semester last semester but it was the first  
math class that I actually learned the math and  
understood what I was doing.  I had geometry  
before but i don't think that's why."`  
  
`LynnLS asks, "Has anyone talked to teachers that are writing grants to  
obtain funding for technology in their districts?"`  
  
`ChrisMorel [guest] says, "r Ellen I might not be able to leave when I  
get there. No Leiasha I don't think so."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "no"  
`  
`LeonardN says, "to Lynn Nor have I"  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "Misty, I need 7 classes after this semester. One  
isn't offered until next spring."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I can ask.  I don't think they're very  
innovative around here."`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Kim]: "Where did you take your Geo class? I need one but  
Rcc doesn't offer one and I hate to go an hour to  
class."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lea [guest]]: "from odu"  
`  
`MistyD says, "Good luck leshia I think i need a lot"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Chris: Bugging people is my favorite pass time"  
`  
`Jim [guest] says, "to/ Lea  Talk to Terry she has been taking geo  
classes."`  
  
`leshia [guest] exclaims, "Ellen, have mercy!!!!"  
`  
`LynnLS asks, "I noticed that many of you referred to the lack of funding  
on the listserve response this week.  You are right, the  
state is not going to fund these initiatives.  What the  
articles didn't always make clear was that the funding  
source is frequently outside of the regular ed. funding.  
Teachers and systems are having to write grants for this  
kind of technology.  Would you be willing to do that?"`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Misty]: "that's awful.  just sit down with the  
curriculum sheet and go through it."`  
  
`Lea [guest] [to Kim]: "was it teletechnet and who was your teacher?"  
`  
`MistyD says, "I think i need 16 classed"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lea [guest]]: "yes natalie hutchinson I did complain  
about the work she made us do but she is  
a really good teacher."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "Within limits. Don't some of the larger systems  
have people whose job is to apply for grants?"`  
  
`Jim [guest] says, "I would be willing to write for grant funding as long  
as the school system would back up the initiative."`  
  
`MistyD says, "I hated doing those projects"  
`  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I'd want to know more of what's involved  
before getting involved in grant writing but  
I'd probably be willing."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Yes, some do, but many times the ideas to start with  
come from teachers that see grant ideas on the web or  
at conferences."`  
  
`Kimdl [guest] [to Lynn]: "I agree with Jim."  
`  
`leshia [guest] says, "I would like to apply for a grant, but I would not  
have any idea how to do it, or if someone would  
have to approve it."`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "It seems initmidating from the outside."  
`  
`kimdl [guest] says, "Good night all.  I need to go."  
`  
`MistyD says, "bye kim"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "I think the willingness to look to that route for support  
in technology will separate you from others in the schools.`

`It is an intimidating process, but most systems have  
someone who will help you through the process."`  

`EllenCa says, "rant writing is very time consuming and it takes a lot of  
research"`  
  
`Lea [guest] exclaims, "Night Kim!"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "bye Kim"  
`  
`EllenCa says, "night kim"  
`  
`Lea [guest] says, "I need to go too, my heating pad is calling."  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "Yes, it is time consuming and should be done by a  
team.  Some grants are small (several thousand  
dollars), and are usually a good place to start."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Lea [guest]]: "Good night - hope the back (is that it) feels  
better.."`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "I am not comfortable with bureaucracies, but I  
guess I would have to overcome that if I saw a grant  
with a good opportunity for technology in my  
district. But here in Henry Co. we are so strapped  
for funds, I think technology is not a very big  
priority"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Good night Lea"  
`  
`Lea [guest] [to Lynn]: "Yes, how did you know."  
`  
`Jim [guest] says, "My daughter used to write for grants for the local  
Literacy Group.  The more she asked for the better she  
became."`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Good night all, my base 10 math conversions are  
calling me.."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "I have done some for social services many years ago but  
before computers was available"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "I've seen where obtaining outside grant monies  
allowed people to become more independent on the  
system also..."`  
  
`Lea [guest] goes out.  
MistyD says, "A grant committee would be good that way only the teachers`

`who are truly interested in helping would be involved"  
`

`EllenCa says, "Leshia I will call you after I get that problem looked at"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "Ah - bases in math - now there's a topic I haven't seen in  
a while - night Leshia"`  
  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "And that money has to go to someone. They aren't  
going to give it to you unless you do what needs to  
be done in going after it"`  
  
`leshia [guest] says, "Ellen, thanks, and I will email you that address."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Thaks"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Right, if you aren't involved in the grant there is  
not a good chance of you seeing much benefit"`  
  
`MistyD says, "LynnLS how do you think this semister has been going with  
the class online"`  
  
`Jim [guest] says, "Well time to pull a Walton.  God night everyone."  
`  
`EllenCa says, "Good night Jim"  
`  
`MistyD says, "bye Jime"  
`  
`MistyD says, "sorry Jim"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "Do districts sometimes withdraw funds if they see  
that money is available from other sources?"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "I think overall from my end it has been going well.  
Amanda has been a big help, and you are a wonderful  
group to work with.  Let me ask you - how has it gone  
for you in comparison to your normal TTN classes?"`  
  
`EllenCa exclaims, "Leonard:  I know that from experience yes!!!"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Yes, we are seeing exactly that happening right now  
in our universities"`  
  
`MistyD says, "I personally like the classroom environment.  I have  
gotten confused on some of the assignments like the last  
listserve.  But I feel the assignments have been layed out  
very well so when I complete a module I don't feel I missed  
anything."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "But, this is usually the case when it gets to be  
extreme - as is the case now and in the early 90's."`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Lynn this class has had a lot more work than most TNN  
classes; But I can also say I have learned a lot more.  I  
really think the tapped ins has been a big help with  
feelings in this class.  I see these people more as`  
`people"  
`  
`LeonardN [to Lynn]: "I can honestly say that I have really enjoyed this  
course (and you don't even have to give me any bonus  
points for saying so). It has been a real challenge  
and I find I do my best work when I'm pushing the  
envelope of my comfort zone"`  
  
`MistyD says, "The last test I was not able to open the journey link  
because my computer would not let me download flash.  I  
think that is one thing that really hurt me on that test."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Does TappedIn help overcome the isolation of the  
online environment for you?"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "The classes that I have so far with the teachers  
lecturing I have not learned as much as the ones I have  
done strikly on line"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Yes, not being able to open the Journey link would  
have been a problem - several of the mult. choice  
came from there."`  
  
`LynnLS [to Keith]: "Thanks, glad you've enjoyed the work."  
`  
`LynnLS [to Ellen]: "I didn't like teaching this on TTN last fall a year  
ago - felt like a talking head and students couldn't  
try out the concepts since they didin't have  
computers in front of them."`  
  
`LeonardN says, "to Lyn Of course, the semester isn't over yet, and I may  
find the last two modules to be more than I can handle  
and I may have to change my mind about this class."`  
  
`MistyD says, "I am a stay at home mom so I like getting out of the house  
in the evenings.  Sometimes it is difficult to function at  
tapped in when my two beautiful children just want my  
attention.  I feel bad by not being able to stop and get  
off the computer for them"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "The Tapped ins have given me a sense of each others  
personality.  The on line work as we have done seems to  
work for me.  I have learned a lot from this class and  
enjoy being able to pick when I can work on homework"`  
  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Yes, I can see where that would be a problem.  
Studies have been done about online students, and  
those that like it and are successful have  
environments at home that can be set aside just for  
that task.  Having your children around would make  
that more difficult."`  
  
`LeonardN exclaims, "Time to go. Bye all. I'll be thinking of you when  
Lynn posts Module 5 tomorrow!"`  
  
`MistyD says, "The tapped in has been successful in answering my  
questions and concerns"`  
  
`AmandaKB has disconnected.  
LynnLS [to Keith]: "Bye for now - the last two modules aren't as hard :)"  
`  
`LeonardN has disconnected.  
LynnLS says, "OK - 9:00 - time to call it a night - might watch the`

`Oscars for a few minutes..."  
`

`EllenCa says, "You know it is past closing time and I still have to do  
Listderver"`  
  
`EllenCa says, "Good night all"  
`  
`LynnLS says, "night ellen"  
`  
`MistyD says, "The beginning of the semister was so difficult I am glad  
the class is getting less difficult.  I won't say easier"`  
  
`MistyD says, "see ya'll later"  
`  
`LynnLS [to Misty]: "Just hang in there.."  
`  
`MistyD has disconnected.  
Karen [guest] says, "good night everyone"  
`  
`EllenCa has disconnected.  
LynnLS has disconnected.

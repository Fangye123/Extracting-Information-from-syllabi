**Course Objectives** : This seminar will consider selected topics in American
law in preparation for the student's research paper. The seminar is intended
primarily to introduce students to the method used in writing a major his-
torical research paper, including the selection of a research topic, creation
of a research agenda, reading, selecting and synthesizing historical material
from original and secondary sources, as well as the process of drafting, revi-
sion, and peer review.

**Texts** : The readings for this course will include  
Peter Hoffer, Law and People in Colonial America  
Jack Rakove, Original Meanings  
David Kyvig, Explicit and Authentic Acts  
William Fisher, Morton Horwitz, Thomas Reed, American Legal Realism  
Francis Prucha, Handbook for Research in American History (2d ed.)

In addition, there are three other recommended books available at the book-
store. Consider purchasing them based upon your research interests.  
Lawrence Friedman, History of American Law (2d ed.)  
Samuel Walker, Popular Justice: A History of American Criminal Justice  
Bernard Schwartz, History of the Supreme Court

Hoffer, Rakove, Schwartz and Prucha are on reserve at Strozier.

**Honor Code** : Students are expected to uphold the Academic Honor Code
published in The Florida State University Bulletin and the Student Handbook.
Persons violating the Honor Code in any assignment or exam in this class will
receive a minimum penalty of a grade of zero (0) for the assignment in
question, and may receive an "F" for the course at the instructor's option.

**Interim Progress Checks** : You will be responsible for creating and handing
in materials at various stages of the course (preliminary topic, final topic,
working bibliography, preliminary outline, annotated bibliography, bib and
research notecards, first drafts). These deadlines are marked on the course
assigment sheet. Successfully completing the progress checks will count 30% of
the course grade.

**Peer Critiques** : You will be grouped with other students in the course and
prepare critiques of work-in-progress. These critiques will take place in week
11. Successful critiques will count toward the 20% participation grade.

**Participation** and Attendance: Participation is partially based upon
attendance. You are required to attend all class meetings, peer critique ses-
sions, library tours and individual meetings with the instructor. Absence from
more than two class meetings/critiques/tours will result in a lower course
grade. Students will be divided into groups to lead discussions during weeks
2-6 on the Wednesday readings.

**Final Paper** : Students will complete a paper (target length: 20 pages,
exclu- sive of documentation) which will be due on Wednesday April 21 in
class. You will write on a topic of your own choice, in consultation with me.
You will need to have selected your topic by Wednesday January 27. The paper
will con- stitute 50% of the course grade. You are responsible for maintaining
a copy of your paper after its original submission (make a duplicate at the
time you turn it in).

**Late Papers** : Late papers will be dropped one full grade for each day
late. No final papers will be accepted after Wednesday April 21. INCOMPLETES
ARE NOT PERMITTED IN THIS SEMINAR.

**Grade Components** :        50% final paper  
                30% interim progress checks  
                20% attendance, vigorous participation in class  
                discussion, critiques, completion of reading  
                assignments  
You must complete all elements of the course to receive a passing grade.  
My grade scale is as follows: 93-100 = A, 90-92 = A-, 87-89 = B+, 83-86 = B,  
80-82 = B-, 77-79 = C+, 73-76 = C, 70-72 = C-, 67-69 = D+, 63-66 = D, 60-62 =
D-, and less than 60 = F.

Students with Disabilities: Students with disabilities should follow these
steps: 1) provide documentation of your disability to the Student Disability
Resource Center (08 Kellum Hall; 644-9566); 2) no later than the first week of

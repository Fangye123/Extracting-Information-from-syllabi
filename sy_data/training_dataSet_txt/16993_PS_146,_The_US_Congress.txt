Office hrs: Monday, 2-4 pm 


Course Description: The popular picture of large
social institutions might be faceless, static organizations,
inscrutable to outside observers.  The seismic shift in Congress since
1994 explodes this view.  Social institutions are, in some degree or
another, constantly changing in response to their environment.  This
course will examine the development and current state of America's
preeminent political institution: the U.S.  Congress.  I will talk
about the ``environment" of Congress in two main ways: external
(mainly electoral) and internal (institutional procedures and
inertia).  The carriers of Congressional change turn out to be, not
surprisingly, the members.  Since Congress makes its own rules, we can
talk about the  institution of Congress as a product of the 
  goals and motivations of the members.  These two views of Congress
--- a 200 year old institution, and a noisy aggregate of members ---
are the centerpiece of this course.

We examine Congress in four steps. First, we look at how members get
to Congress, and what we expect them to do once they get there.  What
is the ``job" of a member of Congress?  What do we mean by
``representation?"  How are members elected, and has the electoral
formula changed in the last few years?  Next, we turn to Congressional
decision--making, first in committees, then on the floor. Who matters
in Congressional decision--making?  Where are decisions  really
made?  Third, we trace changes in Congress since the early 1970's, the
so--called post--reform Congress, and try to link these changes with
significant rules changes instituted in the 104th Congress.  In tandem
with the nation, Congress experienced seismic shifts in its membership
and internal rules and procedures.  These changes played themselves
out through Ronald Reagan's administration in the 1980's, and explain
a lot about the discontent we feel with Congress in the 1990's.  Can
Congress govern?  And what alternatives are there?  Finally, we
attempt to address the changing Congress in the post 1994 era.  Are
the old theories lacking?  What can we learn from the new Republican
Congress?  As a guide to our study, we examine two case studies in
depth, the 1986 Tax Bill and the 1995 Budget Crisis.

Requirements:
 Section assignments (30%)
 Two short in-class midterms (30%)
 A final paper (40%)


Readings: The following books are on order at the
Duke University Bookstore:
 Douglas Arnold, The Logic of Congressional Action
  Birnbaum and Murray.   Showdown at Gucci Gulch
 Dodd and Oppenheimer.   Congress Reconsidered, 5th Edition
  Fiorina.   Congress: Keystone of the Washington 
Establishment, 2nd Edition
 Jacobson.   The Politics of Congressional Elections 3rd
Edition
 Kettl, Deficit Politics
 Rohde.   Parties and Leaders in the Postreform House
 There is a bound set of materials on reserve at Perkins.  You
  will need to photocopy these materials.  They are lengthier than
  previous years in order to include material on the new Congress.


 There will be a  current events portion to each 
midterm examination.  You are expected to read a quality daily newspaper.  It is
impossible to track Congress on a regular basis without one, and this is 
even more true during this historic period.  I strongly recommend a 
subscription to the New York Times, and will pass out subscription sheets 
in class.  For $25.00 a term, this is one of the best bargains around.
You may also be able to satisfy this requirement by watching CNN's
``Inside Politics'' and ``Capitol Gang'' or CSPAN on a regular basis.

If you have not taken PS91 or feel that your knowledge of basic
Congressional structure is lacking, you should supplement the readings
here.  A text by Oleszek,  Congressional Procedures and
  Policymaking to be a very useful reference source.  A simpler,
basic review of Congressional procedures can be obtained from  How
  Congress Works, published by CQ Press.  Both are non circulating
and can be read in the Public Documents room in Perkins.  Finally,
there is an online guide to ``How Are Laws are Made'' available at
          http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT

or through this class's home page at 
          http://www.duke.edu/~gronke/congress.html.

I  strongly encourage you to refer to them if you are weak on
fundamentals.  Otherwise, you will get lost.

 All readings are required. DODD means from the Dodd and
Oppenheimer reader.  CP means from the coursepack in the reserve room.
HCW means a chapter from the  How Congress Works text in the
public documents room.

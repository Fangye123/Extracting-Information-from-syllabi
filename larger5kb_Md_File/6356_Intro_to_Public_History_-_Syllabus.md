Welcome to **Introduction to Public History** , a seminar designed to
introduce graduate students to the theory, methods, and practice of history
outside the classroom. In this seminar, we will investigate the challenges of
historical work in historic sites, museums, archives, and other public history
settings. We will pay particular issues to these questions (among others):  

> > **How is history communicated to the public?**

>>

>> **How do public history sites contribute to public memory?**

>>

>> **How and why do controversies emerge in public history settings?**

>>

>> **What is the relationship between academic history and public history?**

>>

>> **How does tourism economics affect the practice of public history?**

>>

>> **What career opportunities exist for historians beyond the classroom?**

  
This is a seminar, not a lecture course. The success of the seminar depends on
the active engagement of all students as well as the professor. The seminar
requirements are:

  * Regular attendance, thorough preparation, and active participation in discussions.

> During this short summer session, attendance is essential. You cannot
receive an "A" for the course if you miss more than two classes.  
>  To contribute to discussion, prepare three to four open-ended questions for
each reading.

  * One oral report (15 minutes). Deadlines to be assigned.

> This report will be based on your review of assigned issues of _The Public
Historian_ , the journal of the National Council on Public History. Your
report should identify and explain two or three themes that recur in the
issues you are assigned. Please bring copies of the tables of contents for all
members of the seminar.

  * One case study of a site-specific public history issue (12-15 pages). Due July 26, by 5 p.m.

> A list of possible topics is attached. The paper should include:

>

>   * An institutional history and the mission of the selected site;

>   * An explanation of the issue and the site's approach to it;

>   * The context of this site-specific issue in the broader field of public
history (based on research in the literature of the field).

>

>

> For this paper, you must visit the site of your study and interview at least
one public history professional who works at the site. You will present your
findings from the case study on an assigned date during the last three weeks
of the seminar.

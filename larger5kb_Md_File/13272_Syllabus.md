UNIT TWO

Science: Social, Political, Physcial

Questions to Think About:  
How "scientific" is the study of politics? of social behavior? How political
is the study and conducting of science? How do the issues raised in our
discussions of History and Philosophy help us think about these questions?

How do we form opinions? How do we decide to abide by some laws but ignore or
break others? What factors determine our behavior? How do scientists form
hypotheses? How do they prove or support them? How can our observations of
human behavior and nature help us understand ourselves, the communities we
hold membership in and our larger world?

These questions, as well as even more challenging ones raised by you, are ones
we will be exploring over the next few weeks in our readings from ACV and as
we read _The Broken Cord_ , a book in which Michael Dorris, an anthropologist,
husband and father, observes and comes to some conclusions about the
development and behavior of his adopted son. How much of what his son Adam
experienced and learned was determined by his mother's behavior while he was
in the womb, his early environment before being adopted by Dorris, and his
life as Dorris' son and a member of a large, loving family? As you begin to
read that book, be aware of how the above sciences are helping you understand
the complicated life that Dorris describes.

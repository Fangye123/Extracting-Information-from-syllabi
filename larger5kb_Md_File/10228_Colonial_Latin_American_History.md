| **_Description_ :  
**This course analyses the origins of the region we now call Latin America. In
terms of chronological focus, we will look at (1) the Iberian exploration and
conquest of the region, (2) the beginnings of colonial society, (3) the impact
of slavery, (4) the transformation of the colonies in the 18th century, (5)
and the initial phase of Independence. Thematically, we will be interested in
the role of religion, the exercise of authority in multicultural societies,
resistance to authority, and the peculiar economics and sociology of
colonialism.

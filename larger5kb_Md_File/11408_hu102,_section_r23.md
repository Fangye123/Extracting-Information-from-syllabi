is a significant part  
of the human world. Its structures, processes, and alterations enter  
into and become part of the structures, processes, and alterations of  
human consciousness, society, and politics... we are surrounded on  
all sides (possibly even the inner side) by a myriad of techniques  
and technologies."

COURSE GOAL:

In HU102, you will continue to develop the skills you worked on in HU101 and
you will bedoing more complex and critical work with sources.

In this course, you will learn and practice how to develop theoretical and
conceptual frameworksthrough which we can see and understand the way
technologies influence individuals and societyat large.

The goal of HU102 is to help you become better writers and thinkers, and the
only way toachieve this goal is to practice writing and all that goes along
with writing -- listening to others,reading what others think, determining the
reliability of sources, interpreting meanings,synthesizing different
viewpoints, and ultimately figuring out how to use and blend what youalready
know with the knowledge you've acquired through your sources.

By the time you complete HU102, you should be able to:

  1. gather sources, assess the reliability of sources, identify what is at stake in various sources,and interpret and synthesize information from a variety of sources
  2. use a standard format for introducing and citing sources
  3. write well-reasoned, clearly written, and focused essays that reveal the complexity of theissue you have chosen to write about

ASSIGNMENTS:

 _[complete description of paper assignments_](papers.htm)

Course work includes reading responses, which are journal entries in which you
respond to theweek's readings. (Please see the syllabus for the days when the
journal will be collected.) Inthese responses you should briefly summarize the
week's readings and also address issues ortopics in the readings that
interested you or led you to ask questions. You might begin yourreading
response by asking the following questions: What ideas interest me most? What
insightsdo these readings offer? What issues are involved in this reading?
What is at stake where theseissues are concerned? What do I agree with in the
reading? What do I not agree with?

In addition to the assigned reading, you will be responsible for choosing an
additional readingfrom the text or any outside reading that applies to the
focus of the course. Plan to present for3-5 minutes on this reading. You will
outline the essay's main point or argument, explain how itapplies to or
expands the readings assigned in class, and share your personal opinion of the
piece.

You will create an annotated bibliography. In it, you will cite and summarize
the sources youhave collected for papers 2 and 3 (please see the "annotated
bibliography assignment" section ofthis syllabus for specifics).

You will be completing three essays in this course. Each of the three have a
slightly differentfocus and different requirements (please see the "essay
assignments" section of this syllabus forspecifics).

Finally, you will be briefly presenting the main focus and ideas of your final
paper to the classduring 10th week. Plan on describing your issue, explaining
its importance, exploring the debatesurrounding it, explaining the
implications surrounding it, and providing a personalopinion/reflection.

(There will be several other short written assignments that you will be
required to complete. Instructions for these papers are attached, are
available on my web site, and will also beexplained and discussed further in
class.)

PARTICIPATION:

Participation is ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. Come to class prepared to discuss
readings andissues. Plan on expressing your ideas, frustrations, questions,
confusions, etc., even if you're notable to articulate them without some
hesitation. Sometimes ambivalent or ambiguous remarksspark the liveliest
discussions.

ATTENDANCE:

Your class participation grade consists primarily of class discussion and the
in-class writingactivities we will be doing. If you are absent, you miss
valuable class time with your peers andwill have difficulty keeping up with
the pace of the class. As emergencies do arise, you will beallowed one
unexcused absence, but you will still be responsible for obtaining the notes
andcompleting the work for that day. A second unexcused absence will make a
difference in yourfinal grade.

Excused absences are allowed in cases of serious illness, the death of a
family member, orofficial university activities. It is important, however,
that you email or call me _inadvance_ to let me know that you will be absent.

PLAGIARISM:

Plagiarism involves presenting someone else's ideas or words as your own.
Plagiarism is aserious offense in the academic community. In the MTU Student
Handbook, plagiarism isconsidered "cheating" and can be cause for dismissal
from MTU. The best way to avoidplagiarism is to understand what it is and to
avoid doing it. Be sure to read chapter 7, pages31-32 of the Guide to
Succeeding First-Year English. If you still are not sure what plagiarism is,be
sure to see me and we'll discuss the issue with more depth.

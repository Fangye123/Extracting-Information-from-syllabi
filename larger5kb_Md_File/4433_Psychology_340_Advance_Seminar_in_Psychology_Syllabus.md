What does it mean for a discipline to call itself a "science"? What are the
cultural and social forces that influence the ways in which data and empirical
"fact" are interpreted? Does science reflect _nothing other than_ a fully
objective reality, or do expectations, political agendas, and subjective human
needs and values act to determine what that objective reality becomes?

Consider the following quotes:

The ``innocence'' of science communities ... is extremely dangerous to us all.
Perhaps people who have exhibited tendencies toward such innocence should not
be permitted to practice science or construct metatheories of science; they
are a danger to the already disadvantaged and perhaps even to the species! --
Sandra Harding

We are witnessing the slow, discontinuous breakup of the old world-view
according to which physical science offers context-free knowledge of the
external world -- Stanley Aronowitz

Science is no longer accepted as a given without the mediation of cultural
codes, social and economic forces, and professional interests -- Dorothy
Nelkin

It is safe to say that many of the founding certitudes of modern science have
been demolished -- Andrew Ross

Recent developments in the history and philosophy of science have led to a re-
evaluation that acknowledges that the goals, methods, theories, and even the
actual data of the natural sciences are not written in nature; political norms
are inescapable, and they too influence the questions we ask, the methods we
choose, the explanations we find satisfying, and even the the data we deem
worthy of recording -- Evelyn Fox Keller

Are these people right? Is the search for an objective understanding of nature
through empirical study a neccesarily futile exercise in naive innocence that
will be destructive to the species?

### Course Objectives:

* To examine the nature of social and political forces and expectations as they influence the practice and product of science
* To examine a number of specific examples of scientific controversy with particular attention given to these factors
* To explore in detail the actual data of a large controversial study in clinical psychology (The Treatment for Depression Collaborative Research Project of the National Institue of Mental Health)

### Readings:

The only book to buy for the course is H. Collins and T. Pinch (1995) _The
Golem._ Cambridge University Press. Most of the reading for the course will be
of articles and books available in the library, both on the shelves and on
reserve.

### Course Requirements:

  * Class Discussion: You are expected to attend all classes and to participate in the discussions of the material. This means that you should not only have read the material but also you should prepare 3 questions for discussion which you will submit to the instructor at each class meeting. Those who say nothing in class and those who overpower and dominate the discussion will not do as well as those who find a balance between the two extremes.
  * Class Discussion Facilitation: Each person in the class will be expected to lead the discussion in one class during the semester. These classes will be near the end of the term. The facilitator/leader is not expected to lecture to the group, but should provide the group with an organized approach to the topic. This will include giving the class a reading assignment.
  * Term Paper: You will write a paper outlining the history of a controversial area of psychology. This paper will include a detailed proposal for a study designed to clarify some aspect of the controversy.
  * Take Home Exams: There will be three take-home exams in the course. The second two exams will require you to do some statistical analyses.

**1\. How do I know when the videos are scheduled for my telecourse?**

Students have four choices in viewing NMC-Net telecourse classes:

  1. The preferred method of viewing telecourse tapes is to watch or tape the programs on your home television from NMC channel 13 (an offering of Charter Communications formerly Cable Michigan).
    1. Each course will have a separate broadcast schedule that will be included in the course syllabus
    2. If you have any difficulty with viewing your program on NMC 13, check your viewing schedule for the course. Any questions or concerns, please contact the NMC 13 coordinator at 922-1072.

main campus bookstore by going to

on the "preorder books" link. Be sure to enter all of the information, as you

the bookstore via e-mail and ask them what they can do to help you out... They
are very flexible, and should be able to make possible any reasonable requests
you may have. Their e-mail address is

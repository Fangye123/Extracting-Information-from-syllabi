# History 403/503  
The Early Republic  
1790-1840

The Early Republic was an age of great ferment for the new nation. It saw the
foundation of the first political parties, as the United States struggled with
the idea of a party system. It saw the country's attempt to break the
political and cultural bonds that had tied it so closely to Great Britain, and
to redefine the polity as a democratic state (an attempt particularly
associated with the presidency of Andrew Jackson). Yet even as the suffrage
was expanded to include white men without property, other groups, including
women, Native Americans, and blacks, strove to use the political language of
republicanism, to call for their own political rights.

Economically and socially, the Early Republic encompassed what historians have
come to call the "Market Revolution"; the transformation of the nation from an
agrarian state with isolated  
pockets of commerce to a nation of new cities and bustling ports, united by
trade networks and tied together by roads and canals. Factory and mass
production changed the work experiences of many Americans and the consumption
experiences of many more, and old certainties and feelings of community had to
be redesigned.

Culturally and religiously, the Early Republic saw a number of different
reforms and enthusiasms flourish: the Second Great Awakening, temperance
reform, land reform, vegetarianism, Shakerism and other perfectionistic sects,
Abolition. Like the 1960's, the 1830's and '40's were a contentious time, but
also a cultural moment in which Americans had great hopes for creating a more
perfect society, whether through legislation or through the regeneration of
the human spirit.

This class will use a mix of lecture, discussion, and group-activity formats
to explore this critical period of change and development in American history.

### Required Books (available at the bookstore):

  1. Paul Gilje and Howard Rock, **Keepers of the Revolution** (Cornell, 1992 
  2. Anthony F.C. Wallace, **The Long, Bitter Trail** (Hill and Wang, 1993) 
  3. Frederick Douglass, **Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass** (Signet Classic) 
  4. Curtis D. Johnson, **Redeeming America** (Ivan R. Dee, 1993) 
  5. Lucy Larcom, **A New England Girlhood Harry Watson, **Liberty and Power** (Hill and Wang, 1990) 
Other required readings will be on reserve in the library, as noted in the
syllabus below.  

### Methods of Student Evaluation

Attendance is mandatory. Any student who exceeds three unexcused absences
throughout the semester will receive a ten percent deduction from his or her
final grade.

### I. Reaction Papers (20 percent of grade)

You will be required to write 1-2 page reaction papers reacting to each
reading, and to hand these in on Thursday at the beginning of the class in
which that reading is scheduled for discussion. The papers must be typewritten
or word-processed. Each reaction paper should contain a short summary of the
most salient points of the reading, but you should also make note of
anyunanswered questions that occurred to you, anything that struck you as
particularly relevant about the reading--any new connections you made as a
result of reading it.

### II. Two Essay Midterms (each 20 percent of grade)

Students will have two take-home midterms throughout the semester. These will
require you to think about what we have been reading and talking about in
class, and try to synthesize and interpret the material. There will be no
minimum length, but you should write no more than ten pages on each essay
midterm. Papers must be word-processed or typewritten. Questions and
accompanying style sheets will be distributed one week before the essays are
due. Essays will be evaluated on content, organization, and mechanics.

### III. Final Project/Presentation (40 percent of grade)

Several options are possible for each student's final project, so it is
imperative that each student come to my office hours by the fifth week of
class and let me know what he or she plans to do. Students may select any
aspect of American History between the period 1790-1840 for in-depth research
and presentation.

Research may be presented in any of the following forms.

  * Traditional 10-12 page term paper, with footnotes in Chicago (Turabian) style 
  * Illustrated children's book, including a "note to parents and teachers" which explains the concepts and goals of your book. 
  * Video documentary (cameras are available at the Center for Educational Development). You must submit the script of the documentary separately. 
  * Poster session (see me for an explanation) 
  * An original play taking historical events as its topic 
  * Hypertext term paper (i.e. on the World Wide Web, integrating pictures and text) 
  * Another form to be approved by the professor 
Students wishing to create a video documentary may work in groups.

Final projects will be evaluated on content and mechanics (i.e. spelling,
grammar,  
appropriate organization), and creative projects will also be evaluated on
creativity. All projects must include a bibliography of at least seven
sources, excluding encyclopedias and reference works. Students may hand in any
elements of their papers or projects ahead of time for critique and
consultation. During the last week of class and finals week, students will
view and discuss each others' presentations; each person is responsible for
presenting his or her work in about ten minutes. In the case of video or web
presentations, special arrangements will be made.

### Grading Scale

A+98-100, A=93-97, A-=90-92, B+=88-89, B=83-87, B-=80-82, C+=78-79, C=73-77,
C-=70-72, D+=68-69, D=63-67, D-=60-62. F=below 60. All grades ending with .5
and higher are rounded up to the next highest grade; all grades ending in .49
or lower are rounded down.

**Program Overview:**

**The City**

The ancient university town of Louvain (Leuven) is located twenty minutes from
Brussels, close to the frontiers of France, Germany, Holland, and Luxembourg
and offering easy access to the institutions of the European Union. In
addition to offering the environment and facilities of an important university
town, Louvain offers close proximity to many of the world's finest museums and
works of art.

**The University**

The Universite Catholique de Louvain was established in 1425. Suppressed in
1797, after the French occupation of Belgium, it reopened in 1817 as a
Catholic university, and is now one of the leading universities in Belgium and
Europe. The campus has since expanded to include locations in Louvain and
Louvain-la-Neuve and a faculty of medicine in Brussels. The school is made up
of more than 20,000 students of over 100 nationalities and 3,000 faculty
members. Facilities of the university include seven libraries, an athletic
center, performing and fine arts facilities, and housing for 10,000 students.

**The Program**

The summer program, which has run annually since 1990, is offered in
association with the Irish Institute for European Affairs in Louvain, Belgium.
Boston College faculty teach the program's core course, "The European
Experience," with the participation of visiting European instructors and
leaders of European political and economic institutions. The course focuses on
European Union's cultural and historical roots, as well as its politics,
institutions, and the economics of integration.

The first part of the program provides an overview of the cultural history of
the lowlands and central Europe, and is taught by professors Jeffery Howe,
Fine Arts; John Heineman, History; and Rev. James O'Donohoe, Theology. The
program includes field trips to Brussels, Ghent, Antwerp, Bruges, and Cologne,
focusing on the history, art, and architecture of these cities.

The second portion of the program concentrates on the current development of
political and economic institutions, and is taught by professors David Deese,
Political Science, and Robert Murphy, Economics. The program includes field
trips to the European Economic Commission, NATO, US Embassy, and the European
Parliament in Luxembourg.

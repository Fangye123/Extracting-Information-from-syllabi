Course Description

  
  
This course explores global dimensions of U.S. history since 1900. The content
is organized chronologically as a series of case studies that illustrate the
central themes and turning points in what some commentators have called the
"American century." We will study the following questions: When, how and why
did the United States become a global power? How has the political, economic,
and cultural expansion of the United States influenced the rest of the world?
What global developments have shaped the history of the United States in the
twentieth century? Two multimedia lectures each week will build on the
"background reading" for each week's tutorial. These lectures will define
important terms, introduce central concepts, and establish the historical
context for the case studies. Tutorials led by the teaching assistants will
provide students with an opportunity to explore primary and secondary sources
that illustrate the themes presented in lecture. The tutorials also introduce
students to the discipline of history by emphasizing a different historical
method or skill in each session. Students are expected to participate actively
in the tutorials, which are staggered to follow the previous week's lectures.
This course uses WebCT software for the management of grades and discussion
lists. **All students in this course must have a student id number, a proxy
account number, and a MUSS userid.**

Grades will reflect both the quality and the quantity of your written and oral
contributions. Pay attention not just to **what** you say, but also to **how**
you say it. For all your written work follow the advice in Mary Lynn Rampolla,
_A Pocket Guide to Writing in History_. Assignments and class participation
will be graded numerically using the 100 point system described in the
[McMaster Undergraduate
Calendar](http://registrar.mcmaster.ca/calendar/year2001/sec_99.htm). The
[Senate's Statement on Academic
Ethics](http://www.mcmaster.ca/senate/academic/acadeth.htm) forbids
plagiarism. Read [Appendix
A](http://www.mcmaster.ca/senate/academic/acadeth.htm#APPEND) carefully. It is
your responsibility to keep copies of all written work that you do for this
course.

**Very Important!** The research essay should be handed in during tutorial on
the appropriate date as specified in the tutorial information sheet. All late
assignments should be turned into the history department essay box on the 6th
floor in Chester New Hall (just to the left when you get off the elevator).
You must supply a hard copy of your essay; we do not accept papers sent by
e-mail or by fax. Late assignments will be penalized 2 points for every day
that they are late. Weekends count as one day in this penalty scheme. All
legitimate excuses for absences in tutorial and late assignments must be
addressed in writing to your section leader. **** Legitimate absences include
illness, family emergencies, or university sponsored sporting events. That you
have a heavy course load this term, have decided to leave early for vacation,
or have scheduled other activities such as work that conflict with tutorials
DO NOT constitute acceptable excuses. You know now all the due dates for your
assignments, so plan accordingly!  
  
Please Note: University regulations prohibit us from leaving graded student
assignments in a public place or with the secretary **.** If you want an
assignment back you must arrange to get it from the teaching assistant in
person (normally this is done in tutorial). When this course ends you will be
able to see all of your graded assignments, including the final course grade,
through WebCT until August 31, 2002. You are welcome to make an appointment to
see how your final exam was graded, but the exam must remain in the custody of
the history department.

WebCT  

**WebCT** ( **Web** **C** ourse **T** ools) is web-based instructional
software that has been adopted in this course to facilitate electronic
discussions and the tracking of student grades. There are 3 steps to get
started:  
  
**Step 1: Make sure you are in the WebCT database.**

> If you officially registered for the course before the end of term 1 then
you were automatically enrolled in the WebCT database. Go directly to step 2\.
[Note: If you already have an account on the CIS WebCT server, your userid and
password should be the same.]  
>

>

> Students who registered late for this course need to be added to the WebCT
database before they can perform the next step. The best way to to do this is
to make sure that you are officially registered for this course and to get a
**MUSS userid** if you don't already have one. Applications for MUSS userids
can be entered from MUGSI at <http://www.mcmaster.ca/dataserv-
bin/mcds0200.pm?CS01>). The WebCT student database will be updated by the
WebCT administrator several times weekly for the first few weeks of classes,
so please be patient while your name is being added. If by the end of the
second week of classes you still cannot logon, send a request to [Dr.
Streeter](mailto:streete@mcmail.cis.mcmaster.ca) asking to be added to History
1BB3. The message must be sent from your McMaster e-mail account and it should
contain a line with the following information: Last Name, First Name, Student
Number, MUSS userid, History 1BB3.

**Step 2: Logon to WebCT.**

> The browser settings needed to use WebCT are explained at:  
>  <http://www.webct.com/quickstart/viewpage?name=exchange_browser_tuneup>.
After you have made sure that your browser is appropriately configured, go to
the McMaster WebCT login entry page at
<http://webct.mcmaster.ca:8900/webct/public/home.pl>. Click "Logon to
myWebCT." A box will open asking for your user name and password. Fill in the
_User Name_ box with your **MUSS userid** , and the _Password_ box with your
**student number**. _For security reasons, you should immediately change your
password._ If you should forget your password you will need to send a message
from your McMaster e-mail account to the WebCT administrator
([webct@mail.ltrc.mcmaster.ca](mailto:webct@mail.ltrc.mcmaster.ca)) with the
following information: MUSS userid, First Name, Last Name, Student Number,
History 1BB3. The subject line of this e-mail message should be: WebCT
Password Reset Request.  
>  
>

**Step 3: Add History 1BB3 to myWebCT**

> From the _Course Listings_ page, click on History 1BB3. You are now inside
the WebCT program and can access the syllabus, mail, and grades from the menu
on the left hand side.

Tutorial Schedule  

Check your student schedule to find your section number. The first date your
tutorial meets can be found by consulting the class schedule. For example,
suppose the registrar assigned you to section 3. Your first meeting would be
on Tuesday, January 15 at 3:30 p.m. in KTH 107.  
  
All students in section 1, as well as students with schedule conflicts or with
no section number on their schedule, must go in person to the history
department (Chester New Hall 619) to see Rita Maxwell, who will assign you to
a new section. It is extremely important that you do this as soon as possible.
DO NOT simply show up at any tutorial you feel like attending. No tutorial can
hold more than 20 students, so we need to keep track of section sizes.

### Description:

This course offers a cultural history of traditional China from some of the
earliest historical records (about 1200 B.C.) up through the late imperial
period (about 1800 A.D.). We will cover the major historical events,
developments, and trends -- social, political, economic, military,
philosophical, literary, and cultural. The main focus of the course will be on
primary sources. We will read (in translation) the most important writings
from the Chinese tradition. These include Shang dynasty oracle bone
inscriptions (used for divination), early Chinese philosophy (including
Daoism, Confucianism, and Buddhism), dynastic histories, historical
biographies, novels, satires, poetry, songs, ritual manuals, diaries,
scientific treatises, philological studies, and political debates. We will
take an interdisciplinary approach, integrating history with literary studies,
philosophy, and anthropology, in order to better understand these texts in
their historical context.

### Grading:

The grade will be based on in-class quizzes and class participation (30%),
mid-term and final examinations (30%), and a final paper (40%) (or two written
essays -- 20% each, 40% total).

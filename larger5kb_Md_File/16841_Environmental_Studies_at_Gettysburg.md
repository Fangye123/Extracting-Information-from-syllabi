###  **Course Content:**

####  **This two-week course is an intensive field and laboratory experience,
in which marine and terrestrial environments in Maine are investigated. The
objectives are to**

> ####  **(1) utilize quantitative field sampling techniques in a variety of
habitats endemic to the glaciated regions of North America;**

>

> ####  **(2) test hypotheses, using descriptive and inferential statistics;**

>

> ####  **(3) demonstrate the similarities between ecological processes in
marine and terrestrial communities; and**

>

> ####  **(4) show the relationships between the environment and human
activities in a rural economy based on forests, heaths, blueberry barrens, and
the sea.**

**In the first eleven days of the course, the class travels to the primary
study area near Machias, Maine, and participates in two to three field
exercises each day. Field sites include the rocky shore, tide pools, sand and
mud flats, open beaches, the spruce-fir forest, blueberry barrens, and peat
bogs, with their unusual insectivorous plants. Quantitative sampling
techniques is utilized to collect data on the populations of organisms living
in these habitats. Opportunities to visit local towns and historics sites in
coastal Maine and New Brunswick, Canada, such as the site of the first naval
battle of the Revolutionary War and Franklin Delano Roosevelt's summer home at
Campobello, are also available.**

**For two days at the end of the second week, students work in the Gettysburg
College campus marine biology laboratory, processing field samples and
completing all data analysis. Each student then has two weeks to submit all
written work for grading.**

###  **Evaluation:**

**Research paper** | **= 25% of final grade**  
---|---  
**Participation in field work** | **= 25%**  
**Participation in laboratory work** | **= 25%**  
**Daily journal** | **= 25%**  
  
**Students are responsible for keeping a daily journal of all science-related
activities. At each and every field site, students describe the geological
landforms, identify all important plant and animal species, and take detailed
notes on the quantitative sampling procedures used to collect class project
data. Students describe the statistical methods used to analyze class data and
include a brief writeup of all six class projects.**

**At the end of the laboratory sessions, each student is given two weeks to
choose one of the class projects about which to submit a fully developed
research paper, using standard scientific format.**

###  **Additional Information:**

**Please remember that this course requires that the class cross into Canada.
Border guards are very interested in what two vans full of young people might
carry with them, and it is extremely important to remember that neither these
officials nor the professor will tolerate drugs or alcohol in the vans.  U.S.
citizens are required to show photo ID of some kind, preferably a driver's
license; non-U.S. citizens are urged to carry their passports.**

**The class leaves from the rear door of McCreary Hall (by the greenhouse) at
7 a.m. on Monday morning _promptly_.    If one is late and thus left behind,
the tuition fee may be forfeited, so it is strongly suggested that each
participant arrive no later than 6:45 a.m. to load the vans and avoid great
disappointment.**

**In Boston, everyone stays at the home of Dr. Commito's stepmother and
father, and in Machias, Maine, the class stays at a local motel.**

**Upon return to Gettysburg on Wednesday, it is the responsibility of each
student to find a place to live until the course is completed on Friday.
Laboratory sessions run from 8:30 a.m. until 5:30 p.m. on Thursday and Friday,
in McCreary Hall, Room 109.**

**All written work must be mailed to the instructor and postmarked no later
than two weeks after the end of the lab sessions.   This postmark, indicating
that the written work is mailed on time, is for the peace of mind of both the
student and the instructor. It is strongly suggested, therefore, that the work
be submitted by registered mail to:**

> **Dr. John A. Commito**  
> **Environmental Studies Program**  
> **Gettysburg College**  
> **300 North Washington Street**  
> **Gettysburg, PA 17325**

  
**Written work postmarked after the required date receives a grade of zero.
The only exceptions are serious, documented, emergencies that are communicated
to the instructor before the deadline (these emergencies do NOT include
computer malfunctions, lost computer disks, difficulties in acquiring library
materials, or "The dog ate it!!").**

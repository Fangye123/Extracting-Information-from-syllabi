_Course Requirements_  

You are expected to complete the required reading and demonstrate your
comprehension of it in all your written work and in classroom participation.
You are also encouraged to explore the recommended readings and other works in
areas of special interest. A longer bibliography of works relevant to this
course will be distributed shortly after the course begins. Take advantage of
the university's excellent film resources and view some of the recommended
films: films marked LMC are available in the Undergraduate Library's Media
Center; others are available to borrow from the Russian and East European
Center.  
There will be several written assignments. (There are no in-class exams.)  
(1) A midterm essay on an assigned topic, of 5-8 pages (1,250-2,000 words),
due March 9. This essay will count for 30 percent of your grade.  
(2) Three short papers (2-3 pages, 500-750 words) on three of the four
collateral readings (Dune, Ginzburg, Baranskaya, Remnick), due on the day of
discussion of these books. Each will count for 10 percent of your grade, to a
total of 30 percent.  
(3) A 12-15 page (3,000-3,750 words) paper analyzing a personal narrative
(memoir) related to some aspect of the history of the Soviet Union. In
addition to reading and commenting on the narrative in detail, you will be
expected to corroborate some of its historical arguments with a small number
(4-5) of scholarly historical works. An annotated list of suitable narratives
will be distributed shortly after the term begins, along with a bibliography
of relevant secondary works on Soviet history. Each student must choose a
different narrative for the paper topic: you may claim your narrative by
seeing me in my office (during office hours or at another arranged time). The
deadline for choosing a book is March 7. Papers will be due May 2. The paper
will count for 30 percent of the final grade.  

Extensions for the written work are possible only with a doctor's or dean's
affidavit. Plagiarism on any written work will be penalized by failure in the
course. Please see the university policy on
[plagiarism](http://www.uiuc.edu/admin_manual/code/rule_33.html) for
definitions and details (http://www.uiuc.edu/admin_manual/code/rule_33.html).  

Classroom attendance and participation will also figure into your grade, and
will count for 10 percent.  

For extra credit, you may volunteer to conduct a show trial of Stalin. The
trial will be held on April 11, as part of Khrushchev's destalinization
campaign begun at the 20th Communist Party Congress in 1956. The entire class
will participate, but 4-6 volunteers are needed to present the case for the
prosecution and the defense. See me if you are interested in organizing the
trial.  
I encourage you to stop in my office to discuss problems or questions about
the course, Russian history, the future of Russia, etc. I would especially
like to consult with you as you work on your paper. During scheduled office
hours in Gregory Hall, my door is open; feel free to drop in. Or you may make
an appointment to see me at another time. You are welcome to e-mail me with
questions and requests for appointments. My mailbox is always open.

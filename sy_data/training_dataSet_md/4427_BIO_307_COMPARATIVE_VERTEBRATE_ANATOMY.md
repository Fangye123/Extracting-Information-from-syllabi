**CLASS TIMES**

Lecture:  
KIRK 212 Mon and Wed 2- 2:50 PM, Friday 12 -12:50 PM

Laboratory:  
KIRK 420 Wed 3 - 4:50 PM and Fri 2 - 4:50 PM

###  **REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS**

Lecture: K. V. Kardong. 1998. Vertebrates: Comparative Anatomy, Function,
Evolution. 2nd Edition.  Wm. C. Brown Publishers.  
Laboratory: K. V. Kardong and E. J. Zalisko. 1998. Comparative Vertebrate
Anatomy, A Laboratory Dissection Guide. Wm. C. Brown Publishers.

###  **COURSE OBJECTIVE**

The objective of this course is to inform the student of the wide variety of
life forms represented by the Vertebrates. In the lecture, the primary
material is the evolutionary history of the vertebrates. This is uncovered by
examination of the various anatomical systems. Whenever possible, the
_functional_ role of differences in _form_ (e.g. morphology) will be
discussed. In the laboratory, the emphasis is on an anatomical comparison of
lower (represented by the Dogfish Shark) and higher (represented by the cat)
vertebrates. Much of the laboratory time will be spent on dissection of these
specimens, with additional organisms and laboratory exercises added in
throughout the course. By the end of the course, the student will have a solid
understanding of the basic anatomy of vertebrates and fundamental knowledge of
the relationship of all vertebrate groups. The organ systems to be studied are
integumentary, skeletal, muscular, endocrine, neuro-sensory, digestive,
respiratory, circulatory and urogenital systems. In addition, emphasis will be
placed on the phylogenetic relationship of vertebrates to clarify evolutionary
trends in the story of the vertebrates. ![](mammal.gif)

###  **COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

There will be three hour-long _lecture exams_ during the course of the
semester. These will be non-cumulative and will emphasize evolutionary themes
and functional morphology. Questions will be short answer and essay. A
cumulative _final exam_ will be essay questions and will emphasize integration
of material from throughout the semester. The three non-cumulative _laboratory
practicals_ will be strictly on anatomy. These practicals will require the
student to identify the anatomical features from the various systems under
study. The first laboratory practical covers less material than the later two,
so is worth fewer points. Lastly, a  paper (details to follow) will be
required on a visit to either the dinosaur exhibit at the Philadelphia Academy
of Natural Sciences or the Lower Vertebrate (including dinosaurs) exhibits at
the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. I will organize a
trip the American Museum in October or November using a Widener van.

###  **GRADING**

Lecture Exams | 3 @ 100 points  | 300  
---|---|---  
Lab Practicals  | I = 75 points, II and III = 100  | 275  
Lecture Final |  | 135  
Field Trip Paper |  | 40  
| TOTAL | 750  
The grades for the semester will follow the ![](IMG00001.GIF)90% = A,
![](IMG00002.GIF)80% = B, ![](IMG00003.GIF)70% = C, ![](IMG00004.GIF)60% = D,
and < 60% = F. In addition, a plus/minus grades will be used for the final
grade. Please note that academic honesty is expected at all times. The Science
Division strictly enforces the University's policy on cheating and other forms
of academic fraud. The student handbook contains a detailed section on the
definitions and consequences of academic fraud (Section G of the chapter on
Academic Policy). For missed exams, a make-up will only be given for
extenuating circumstances that are properly documented. Attendance of both
laboratory and lecture are required. Five or more un-excused absences during
the semester (total for both lab and lecture) will result a drop in the final
grade by one letter grade. Additional multiples of five un-excused absences
will result in further letter grade drops. Details of the Science Division
grievance procedure can be obtained in the Science Division Office.

It's Frog's Life  
A frog telephones the Psychic Hotline and is told, "You are going to meet a
beautiful young girl who will want to know everything about you." The frog
says, "This is great!  Will I meet her at a party, or what?"  "No," says the
psychic, "Next semester in her biology class".

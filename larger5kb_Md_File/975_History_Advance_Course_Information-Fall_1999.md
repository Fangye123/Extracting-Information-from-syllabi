History 10--Theories of History/Theories of Society in Nineteenth-century
Europe

Professor Mark Traugott

**Preliminary Syllabus**

**COURSE DESCRIPTION** : Many of the assumptions and orienting concepts we use
to make sense of modern life took shape in Europe during the long nineteenth
century, when the relationship between history and the social sciences was
defined. This course uses the close analysis of texts and a combination of
intellectual, political, social, and economic history to examine the form and
the context in which those new conceptions of the modern world emerged.
Students will read, in the original, the landmark works of theorists who
helped define the terms of debate over the nature of the human individual and
over that individual's relationship to society. In the process, the course
will invite students to confront the timeless issues raised by life in a
social context: how to make sense of the elusive patterns which govern long-
term social development as well as day-to-day social interaction; how to
balance the conflicting needs for social order and social change; and how to
reconcile the rights and obligations of individuals on the one hand and the
social group on the other. The course will also ask how each author conceives
of the historical process and to what extent an explicit theory of history is
being advanced. The course as a whole will attempt to present an overview of
the characteristic assumptions concerning the directionality and coherence of
history that have dominated the modern era.

The core of the course will consist of readings from the works of four main
figures --- Alexis de Tocqueville, Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim
--- all of whom made significant contributions to the study of history, even
as they helped lay the groundwork for the disciplines of sociology, political
science, economics, and anthropology as we know them today. This material will
be preceded by an introductory segment on early-modern precursors of the
socialized perspective on history (particularly the analytic individualism of
such figures as Hobbes, Locke, Smith, and the crucial transitional figure of
Rousseau) and will be followed by a concluding segment that points in the
direction of twentieth-century developments.

**READING LIST** : The following books will be available in paperback editions
at the Bay Tree Bookstore. They have also been placed on reserve at McHenry
Library.

Durkheim, Emile, _The Division of Labor in Society_ , Free Press.

quarter.

History 26: WWII Memories in the US and Japan (WWII Mem US Japan)

Instructors: Alice Yang-Murray and Alan Christy

This class examines how the meanings of such issues as the atomic bomb, war
responsibility, war conduct, war reparations and racism have been subjects of
contention in postwar US and Japan. Our goal is to consider the ways that
changing memories and situations have had an impact on the US-Japan
relationship and, conversely, the way the relationship has helped to structure
war memories.

Making use of a wide range of media (film, slides, museum exhibits, web pages
and primary sources) students will actively discuss and debate the meaning of
memory and history between 1941 and the present. Course work will include a
weekly film series.

This class fulfills the Ethnic Studies/Third World (E) and the topical course
requirement in the humanities (T4) GE requirements.

History 30A--Modern European History

Bruce Thompson

[brucet@cats.ucsc.edu](mailto:brucet@cats.ucsc.edu)

EUROPE 1450-1789

Our course examines early modern European history from the Renaissance to the
Enlightenment. Its major themes include: the origins of the modern state; the
advent of a global economy dominated by Europe; the impact of such new
technologies as gunpowder and printing; the sources of cultural innovation,
and of new conceptions of the self and the world; and the causes and
consequences of conflict, persecution, and war. But in addition to tracing the
origins of modernity, we will ask what it was like for ordinary people to live
through the extraordinary transformations of this period. And we will
highlight the writings of some of the great critics of European civilization,
from Erasmus and More to Swift and Voltaire.

Course requirements include regular attendance of lectures and weekly
discussion sections, two 6-page papers based on the readings, and a final

TOPICS FOR THE FIRST PAPER

1\. Imagine that Thomas More had not been executed by Henry VIII and had
therefore lived long enough to receive a copy of the English translation of
Machiavelli's _The Prince_. He writes a letter to his friend Erasmus in which
he describes the contents and method of that work. While acknowledging the
shrewdness of the author's judgments, he is generally critical of Machiavelli
and regards his book as a confirmation of his own worst fears about the
condition of Europe. Write your own version of that letter.

2\. Imagine that a copy of More's _Utopia_ has been discovered in Niccolo
Machiavelli's library, along with five pages of critical observations about
the text in Machiavelli's own hand. Machiavelli is impressed by Raphael's
analysis of European affairs in Book I, but regards Book II, with its detailed
account of Utopian society, as irrelevant to the problems of Italy. Write your
own version of those notes.

3\. Imagine that Erasmus of Rotterdam has not died of complications from
syphilis but on the contrary has lived long enough to read Montaigne's essay
"On Cannibals." He regards the essay as having been written in the spirit of
his own _Praise of Folly_ , and he writes his fellow humanist an appreciative
letter that underscores the similarities between their methods and
perspectives. Montaigne replies with a grateful letter in which he
acknowledges his debt to the master. Write your own version of this
correspondence.

4\. The great European humanists often seem to resemble physicians offering
diagnoses of the ills of the body politic. Choose any one or two of the
writers we have encountered so far, and show how the prescription each writer
offers follows from his diagnosis. In other words, to what crisis or adverse
trends is each writer responding, and what solutions does he suggest?

**History 080A--Introduction to Global History**

**Mr. Burke  
Tu/Th 10:00-11:45**

In our society the human and natural sciences have progressed by asking
narrower and narrower questions about less and less. While this has brought
enormous advances in knowledge, it has also had a major downside: a sense of
how it all fits together has been lost, and attempts to ask large questions
have been systematically discouraged. This course is a deliberate effort to
move against this trend. It views the past in the largest possible context
(from the origins of the universe to the present) and seeks to raise questions
often overlooked in more specialized courses. Explicitly interdisciplinary and
synthetic, it aims at providing students with a coherent sense of the past and
present of specific human societies.

Instead of deluging students with information, it encourages them to raise
large questions about human beings and their place in the history of nature,
the planet and the universe. By studying how different societies have answered
large questions, and how they have tested and refined their answers, the
course seeks to develop skills of question-asking, not fact-gathering.

**Topics** covered include the origins of the universe, of the earth and of
life, the first human beings, hunting and gathering societies, the
agricultural revolution, early civilizations, ancient empires, the great
transformation, the modern world order.

**Readings** are due _at the beginning_ of the week in which they are
assigned.

History 124--Revolutions in France, 1789-1871

Professor Traugott

**Preliminary Syllabus**

The fall of the Old Regime in France and the sequence of political and social
changes it set in motion has long been viewed as the defining moment of the
modern era. The aftershocks of the 1789 revolution --- in 1830, 1848, and 1871
--- produced an ongoing level of political upheaval in French society that has
remained without historical parallel. This class examines that century-long
period of intense and rapid change, while also trying to understand the
essential continuity exhibited by French culture and society over the course
of the nineteenth century. Readings and class discussions will present a
variety of analytic styles, including narrative, political, economic, social,
Marxist, and revisionist approaches to the history of the period. In an effort
to bring this material to life, the work of professional historians will be
supplemented by occasional use of primary sources, films, and slides depicting
key events. At least half of the quarter will be spent on the French
Revolution of 1789. Relatively brief two-week segments will be devoted to the
Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, while the Paris Commune of 1871 will be
considered mainly as a way of calling attention to some of the regularities
that emerge when these discrete revolutionary episodes are viewed as parts of
an inter-related process. The objectives of the course include familiarizing
students with the revolutionary history of France; encouraging them to search
for consistent patterns that connect historical events at different times and
in different places; and helping them to understand how the turmoil of the
nineteenth century has left its mark upon French society and world history as
we understand them today.

**A Note to History Majors**

Majors who take this course may also be interested in the senior seminar I
will be offering in the following quarter. I expect this to be a small class
which will focus on historiographical issues and the use of primary sources (a
considerable number of which are available in English) relating to the French
Revolution. Students will be expected to prepare a full-scale research paper
that addresses a topic of historical significance and that beings empirical
evidence to bear. History 124 will be a pre-requisite for admission to this
intensive senior seminar.

History 147--California History

This upper division lecture course examines California's history. We begin
with a look at geology and ancient societies. The course proceeds to examine
native societies at the point of spanish conquest, spanish colonial and
mexican society, the war with Mexican and U.S. conquest of California,
statehood, the gold rush, and immigration and migration from around the world.
These themes take us through the mid-nineteenth century and the first half of
the course. In the second half of the course we follow the course of rapid
economic and ecological, social and cultural change in the late nineteenth
century, and then trace the emergence of Los Angeles as the preeminent and
reknown 20'th century city.

Twentieth century California is intensively studied through the final month
ofthe quarter. We study history through many different people's experiences
and by tracingsocial, economic, cultural and political change. The readings
are excellent and offer a range of materials, writing styles and viewpoints.
During each period we examine, the history is brought to life through film and
images that I show in the form of slide lectures. Excellent reading complement
lectures.

Each student will be able to complete a small research paper - and will also
write a straightforward mid-term and final exam.

History 159A--The History of Premodern Japan

Instructor: Noriko Aso (Merrill 108, 459-5371)  
Teaching Assistant TBA

COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course covers the history of the peoples living in the Japanese
archipelago from prehistoric times to the 18th century. The history of
premodern Japan is usually presented as the story of the origins of the
Japanese people and their culture. The standard conclusion of this kind of
history is that the Japanese always have been and always will be a certain
kind of people.

Our emphasis, on the other hand, will be on History as a process of struggle
and change. As a result, we will not assume the unity of the "Japanese nation"
nor the homogeneity of the "Japanese people." Instead, we will look at the
many ways that people identified themselves over time, "Japanese" being only
one possible identity (and one of the least used). The present-day Japanese
will be seen to be less the result of a natural progress from the past and
more the result of struggles in which some people won and some people lost.

In order to help us envision this kind of history, we will do our best to
examine both the familiar histories of the ruling classes of Japan and the
experiences of the people usually left out of the history books. We will
investigate this latter group through visual images, literature, religion and
performing arts.

SPIES: ESPIONAGE AND INTELLIGENCE IN 20TH-CENTURY EUROPEAN HISTORY

Espionage is undoubtedly one of the world's oldest professions, but its
history has been, until recently, relatively underdeveloped. This course

examines images of the spy in popular culture, from the war scares of the
beginning of the century to the cold war fantasies of Ian Fleming and John Le
Carre.

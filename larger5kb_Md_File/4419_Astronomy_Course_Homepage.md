** Course summary:  **

This course has been designed for non-science majors as an introduction to the
ideas and modes of thought in the physical sciences. It adopts as a theme the
use of the atom as an imperturbable clock, through which we can construct a
quantitative history extending back to the begininng of time itself. We begin
with a thorough exploration of the nature of atoms and their constituent
particles, as well as the fundamental concepts of energy and radiation,
including the physical basis of the human senses. We then go on to apply these
tools in fields as diverse as art history, anthropology, geology and
astronomy, discussing how art forgeries are detected, how human diet and
agriculture evolved, this history of the Earth's climate and its implications
for our future, and the origin of the Universe itself.

The course is designed as a year-long sequence to satisfy the College Science
component of the Core. The first semester deals with the basic physics and
chemistry of the atom and applications such as dating the Shroud of Turin,
determining the history of diet, and using tree rings as a measure of the
temperature and composition of the atmosphere over the last 12,000 years. The
second semester develops further the subject of paleoclimatology, extending
our history of the climate back millions of years and examining the
implications of this work for our understanding of global warming. We conclude
with a discussion of how we determine the age of the Earth and Sun and,
finally the origin and evolution of the Universe and its conetnts. It is
possible to take the second semester without having had the first, although a
small amount of remedial work may be required; students interested in doing
this should speak with me. I will be holding extra sessions of the class at a
mutually agreeable time begining the week of Jan 22 to review the essentail
material from the first semester. I will also explore the possibility, as
suggested by several students from the first semester on their course
evaluation forms, of having a voluntary recitation session.

** Prerequisites and Requirements:  **

**Prerequisite:** None, but high school algebra and latent curiousity are
assumed.

**Requirements:** This course satisfies the College Science Requirement and
the General Studies Science Requirement. It may satisfy the Barnard
Quantitative Reasoning requirement, but you had better check. It does NOT
satisfy the Barnard Science Requirement unless you are also signed up for the
Introductory Physics Lab at Barnard; if you are in this circumstance, please
see me.

This is the second semester of a full-year course. The second semester is NOT
required to obtain credit for the first -- see above.

*The lowest score (which can be the one you blew off) will be dropped. **You may work together on the problem sets in groups of less than or equal to three. Each group must provide only one set of solutions which includes the names of those who contributed; all group members will receive the full credit awarded for the work accomplished.

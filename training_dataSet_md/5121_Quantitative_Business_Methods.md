**GENERAL INFORMATION:**

QBA 336 is essentially the study of quantitative methods and model building to
aid managers in decision making.  
  
**OBJECTIVES OF Q.B.A. 336:**

The primary objective of this course is to expose students to the general
principles that govern management science models. Some of these models are
extensively intertwined with complex mathematical models. The students are
also provided with specific mathematical techniques designed to allow some
degree of proficiency in the application of management science methodology in
decision making. Each of the management science models will be treated at two
levels: Basics and Extensions:  
. Decision analysis.  
. Linear programming.  
. Duality.  
. Integer programming.  
. Distribution models.  
. Network analysis.  
. Waiting Lines.  
. Markov analysis.  
. Forecasting.  
. Dynamic Programming.  
. Inventory models.  
. Multiple criteria decision-making.  
  
**MATHEMATICAL & STATISTICAL BACKGROUND:  
**  
Mathematics:  
Functional relationships, solution of two linear equations, and mathematical
operations of linear equations.  
  
Statistics:  
Basic probability theory, descriptive statistics, expected value and normal
distribution.  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

Regular attendance is mandatory for each student. Daily class preparation is a
prerequisite to success in this course. Students are expected to read all
assignments and prepare homework before class. Late homework assignments will
not be accepted. STUDENTS MUST TURN IN THEIR HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS BEFORE EVERY
CLASS SESSION. A grade of "O" will be assigned to any homework assignment
submitted late.  
  
**CLASS DEMEANOR:**

Student behavior in class will be evaluated in determining the final grade.
The student is expected to behave and perform in a professional manner, e.g.
be punctual and attend all classes, participate in class, dress appropriately,
and be attentive during class. Negative behavioral patterns, e.g. unexcused
absences, tardiness, class disruptions, men wearing hats, eating, drinking or
sleeping in class, or any other unbecoming activity could result in a
reduction of up to 10% of a student's final grade. Lecture begins on the hour.
Students who are more than 5 minutes late will not be allowed in the
classroom.  
  
**ABSENCES:**

Faculty may lower grade when the number of unexcused absences exceeds the
number of credit hours.  
  
**CHEATING & PLAGIARISM: **

A student who cheats on an exam, a quiz, paper, etc., has at a minimum, an
automatic "F" for the exam, quiz, paper, and all required course materials.  
  
A student who cheats on the final exam will receive a grade of F as his/her
final grade. This is non-negotiable. Thus, for this purpose cheating includes
but not limited to the following:  
  
Securing by any means whatever, information about the specific contents of an
exam prior to that exam or giving such information to another student; the use
of notes or other materials during an exam; looking at another student's work
during an exam or allowing another student to look at your work/exam.  
  
Any student who cheats or plagiarizes will also be referred to the Academic
Dean for further action.  
  
**DEMERIT FOR FORM:**

Extreme care is to be used in preparing all assignments. Each assignment
should be well planned, organized and presented in good format. No rough work
will be allowed. Marks will be deducted for poor format, lack of organization,
and rough work.

**GRADING SCALE:**

90-100% = A; 80-89% = B; 70-79% = C; 60-69% = D; 0-59% = F  
  
Project    100  
Assignments    100  
Five Exams    500  
Final Exam    200  
Total    900 ( 70% of the final grade)  
  
Project:  
Every student is required to find a real-life business problem and apply two
of the tools covered in class for its solution. A presentation of this project
not exceeding 30 minutes will also be required.  
  
**ASSESSMENT OF QBA 336:**  
  
The assessment of the objectives of this course will consists of proper
evaluation of three areas.  
  
Area 1:  
All examinations, a project exercise, and all assignments including case
studies. This area is responsible for 80% of the final grade.  
  
Area 2:  
Computer competence. Each student will be required to demonstrate some degree
of proficiency in some chosen areas of the syllabus. This will account for 20%
of the overall grade.  
  
Area3:  
Journal Entry: Also, students will be required to keep a journal. The journal
will serve two purposes. One, the students will use it to record all the
classroom activities. Two, the students will use this journal to provide the
professor with some feedback about specific areas of difficulty of the course,
computer problems, progress or otherwise in the coverage of the course
content, and "special problems". This journal will be evaluated periodically.
Twenty percent is assigned to this area.

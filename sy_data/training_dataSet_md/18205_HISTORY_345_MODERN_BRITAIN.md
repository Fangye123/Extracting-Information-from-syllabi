## OVERVIEW and OBJECTIVES of the COURSE

### MODERN BRITAIN

From some of the earliest periods of recorded history there has been a place
in those records for the story of Great Britain and its people. Through time
the history of the people of the "tight, little island" has been closely
interwoven in the story of all nations and peoples. Institutions of government
as well as concepts of law and jurisprudence; archetypal forms of literature
and classic art, architecture, and music; social conventions as well as
scientific principles; industrial advancements and modern technologies as well
as socio-economic philosophies - all of these and more are a part of the
history and legacy of Great Britain. It is a story of queens and kings,
commoners and colonials. It is a story whose geography encompasses Glasgow,
Belfast, and London as well as Cardiff and Dover and beyond "the isles" to
Boston, Calcutta, and Hong Kong.

Our task is to explore that rich and varied story of Britain from the time of
the Glorious Revolution of 1688 to the era of Lady Thatcher and Tony Blair.
The examination of political, economic, social, and cultural forces will
characterize our analysis and critique. The principal areas of our study: the
development of a stable and responsive governmental structure; the
establishment of the world's first truly industrial economy; the growth of
British empire and world power; the unique character of the Victorian era; the
emergence of the welfare state in the 20th century; the end of empire and the
chaotic character of the contemporary period.

### **SUPPLEMENTAL READING ASSIGNMENTS

** Various readings will be assigned during the semester to complement the
text and lecture. These readings will be distributed in class. They are to be
completed prior to discussion of the material in class lectures.

### **SUPPLEMENTAL INTERNET RESOURCES

** To assist in gathering a knowledge and understanding of many issues in the
text as well as in classroom discussions and as an adjunct to your own
research I have posted a Modern Britain Website which you might wish to access
and use as is appropriate. Access: **MODERN BRITAIN 1688-2000**
(www.kings.edu/hbfedric/britweb.html)

### **WRITTEN RESEARCH ASSIGNMENTS

** Two (2) written research papers will be assigned. Guidelines for each
assignment will be distributed as appropriate. Exploration of various research
resources including the library and the Internet will be encouraged in the
completion of these assignments. Students will be expected to demonstrate
proficiency in applying the writing and critical thinking developed in CORE
110 and CORE 100. All students will be expected to submit papers in typed or
word processed form. Handwritten work will NOT be accepted. Research
assignments submitted more than a week after the deadline date without prior
approval - highest grade possible "C". Failure to submit any and all work on
or before the last class day - automatic grade "F" on the work.

### **CONTEMPORARY SUBJECTS RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT AND REPORT

** After the mid-semester a research assignment will be made on a subject or
subjects of contemporary significance. Guidelines will be distributed as
appropriate. The nature of the assignment will be a combination of oral and
written presentation.

### **TESTS

** There will be three (3) written tests given during the semester including
the final examination. The first two tests will be announced in class at least
ten (10) days in advance. The third (final) examination will be given
according to the Registrar's examination schedule. The tests will be based on
the lectures and assigned reading materials. The general structure of the
tests will be essay. Each test will be non-comprehensive and will review the
most recent materials covered.

### **CLASSROOM and DISCUSSION LIST PARTICIPATION

** Regular participation - asking or responding to questions, volunteering
one's own ideas or arguments, sharing evidence - is expected from each
student. Participation will be weighed positively in the overall semester
grade evaluation as a growth/development factor.

### **ATTENDANCE

** You are expected to attend classroom lectures/discussions on a regular
basis. The rules of the College regarding class attendance will be followed
strictly. You are responsible for all materials discussed in lectures and
classroom discussions. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ABSENCE of THREE (3) - excused OR
unexcused. Three consecutive absences or a pattern of absence over a three
week period will initiate an Excessive Absence Report to the College
Registrar. It is to be correctly assumed that it will be impossible to receive
a grade which is higher than the percentage of days attended without
significant reasons. Absence on the day of a scheduled test will not be
excused unless a serious reason has been explained to me (in advance, if
possible) and arrangements for a make-up test are made within five (5) class
days of the scheduled test. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to arrange the make-up
with me. It should not be presumed that absence on a test day will
automatically permit a re-test.

### **SEMESTER GRADE EVALUATION

** The determination of the final semester grade will be based on the
successful completion of all requirements for the course using numerical
values as follows:  
**Tests** : Test I, II, III - 60% total (20% each)  
**Written Research Assignments** \- 30% total (15% each)  
**Contemporary Subjects Research Assignment** \- 10%  
The professor's grading scale to be used is as follows:  
A+ = 98     A = 95    A- = 92  
B+ = 88    B = 85    B- = 82  
C+ = 78    C = 75    C- = 72  
D+ = 68    D = 65    F = 59  

### **OFFICE CONTACT / OFFICE HOURS

** Learning is not achieved only within the confines of a classroom. To that
end be advised of the following:

It is true in any case that self-love and grandiose self-esteem are the most
general psychological characteristics of an outstanding teacher.

### Fall 2000

  * **Electron Lit: Hypertext Theory and Practice.** The dawn of the computer age has seen the emergence of a new genre of literature, hypertext -- nonlinear fiction and poetry created specifically to be read on a computer. Each hypertext is unique: The author not only provides the "text" (which can include graphics and sounds) to be "read," but also designs the software means by which the reader navigates the work. In truth, hypertext authors are making their own books -- and their own reading technology.

  * **Writing Online: Cybertext and the New Media.** The advent of the World Wide Web has made possible a new form of self-expression, cybertext: nonlinear fiction, poetry, memoir, and creative nonfiction created specifically to be read online. In this class, we explore and experiment with all kinds of online writing -- from the simplest e-mail exchange to sprawling Web fictions such as Mark Amerika's [_Grammatron_](http://www.grammatron.com/) _._ In between, we check out threaded discussions, newsgroup rants and raves, interactive stories, MUDs, MOOs, and other emerging forms. Each student contributes to a Web site for the class and presents a final cybertext project of h/er own devising. Online conferences are held with at least two cybertext authors.

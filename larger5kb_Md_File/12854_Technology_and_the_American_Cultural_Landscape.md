\'93Technology and the American Cultural Landscape\'94 examines these
questions as it addresses one of the major debates in the history of
technology: the relationship between technological change and cultural change.
\par \tab The course has three units. The first defines terms of the debat e
and offers some methodological background. What are the sources scholars have
used to understand the relations between technology and culture? What did
people say about the future of radios and airplanes when they were developed?
Why were similar fan tasies about women\rquote s future liberation fastened
onto both bicycles and trousers? These histories of the future provide a
context for contemporary technological forecasting. In this unit, we also
examine the implications of specific technologies (documenta ry film, museums,
heritage sites) for representations of American culture and history. \par \tab
The second and third units turn to built and sensory environments. Social and
cultural values are embedded in the engineered landscapes of streets, parks,
and other sp aces. For example, parks were created in many nineteenth-century
cities because they were believed to have moral and physical curative powers.
Such landscapes are historical documents that can be read. Similarly, the
sensory environments of sound, smel l , and taste need to be understood within
specific historical and geographic contexts. For example, the arrival of
phonograph records turned music into an object that could be bought, sold and
collected without listeners ever attending a live performance. \par \tab As we
move towards a culture increasingly characterized by virtual reality and
computer-mediated interactions, this course explores the extent to which
America is already a \'93culture of simulation.\'94 \par \par }{\b\cf1\cgrid0
Readings: \par \par }{\cf1\cgrid0 \tab }{There are no books to purchase for
this course. Instead, five or six articles or book selections will be assigned
for each session. }{\cf1\cgrid0 Most readings are available in a course reader
that can be purchased from Quartet on Clark Street. A few readings are
available on the web or on the Blackboard site, and can be downloaded and
printed. \par \par }{\b\cf1\cgrid0 Course Requirements, Assignments and
Grading: \par \par }{\cf1\cgrid0 \tab Course requirements are weighted as
follows: Class participation 30%; Short writing assignments 20%; Final

{\cf1\cgrid0 Course requirements include attendance at all seminars, and
prompt submission of all assignments. Poor attendance and/or late papers will
result in a lower grade. There will be no extensions on the assignments. \par
Professor Light reserves the right to modify the course syllabus and
assignments a s necessary during the quarter. It is your responsibility to
check the Blackboard site regularly for course announcements and updates.

discusses the growth of mass production in the early 20}{\super th}{ century
in manufacturing. To what extent can we say his arguments are true for food
and taste? What are some of the key claims these authors make about
transformations in the culture of food over the past 100 years? In what ways
are these changes like or unlike changes in other aspects of American culture?

**INTRODUCTION**

 This class is intended to give you a first hand acquaintance with six of the
most important thinkers of the last five hundred years: Michel de Montaigne,
Jean Jacques Rousseau, Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx and Sigmund
Freud. It is intended to spark your interest in further exploring the thought
of these individuals and in other important thinkers who could not be included
due to time limitations. It is further designed to give you some insight into
the circumstances in which each worked and to which each responded.

The course will be conducted seminar style as I believe that your discussion
and debate of the ideas of these authors and the circumstances in which they
worked will give you a much stronger grasp of their ideas and their historical
context than simply listening to me lecture. Therefore, I will only devote a
limited amount of time to lecturing. Your participation in class discussion
and your efforts to understand the readings for each class are essential to
the success of this course.

**REQUIRED READINGS**

 Montaigne, _Selected Essays_

Rousseau, _Basic Political Writings_

Heilbroner, _The Essential Adam Smith_

Appleman, ed., _Darwin_ : A Norton Critical Edition

Marx, _Selected Writings_

Freud, Peter Gay, ed. _The Freud Reader_

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

  _Graduate Students (enrolled in HY 590):_ You will

 I. give at least two in-class presentations on readings for a class; no more
than one presentation may be given on any particular thinker.

 II. write a paper in which you will deepen their knowledge of one or more of
the thinkers studied by reading further in that author's own writings and in
the historical scholarship concerning the thinker(s) in question. You will be
asked to choose a particular aspect of the individual(s)'s thought on which to
focus. You will also write a proposal for your project, a rough draft which I
will critique, and a final draft of 15-20 pages.

  _Undergraduate Students (enrolled in HY 457):_ You will

I. Give at least two oral presentations an assigned class reading of an
author; no more than one presentation may be given on any one thinker.

 II. either fulfill the assignment for graduate students above or write two
7-10 page papers on two _different_ thinkers. For each paper you may choose
either of the following:

 A) You may write a paper that will present a discussion of one or more works
of your chosen author, in which you will 1) explain the argument of the
writing in question, 2) explain its significance for that author's overall
thought and 3) consider the influences of other thinkers and of the social,
political and cultural factors that influenced the author in the writing of
that work. **OR**

B) You may write a critical review of a book or several articles relating to
one of the thinkers studied, an historical interpretation of a well-defined
aspect of one thinker's thought, or a combination of the two.

##  What the students said about the course

|  _This is a complete transcript of the students' feedback after taking the
course.  
On behalf of the future students of STAT 391 thanks to everyone who gave
feedback and comments, here and on other occasions. Your comments matter: see
in the following how the new edition of "Probability and Statistics for CS"
will reflect your suggestions. (MMP)_

**Was this class intellectually stimulating? Did it stretch your thinking?**

  * Yes - I really enjoyed it all...difficult, but in a good way. 
  * Yes - This class was certainly stimulating (despite my biological inability to reach conscious). I found myself having immediate applications of most of the material in my research projects. 
  * Yes - This was probably by far one of the most intellectually stimulating classes I have taken here. I liked how understanding the material required almost all of my math/logic knowledge and then took it further. Covers some really cool concepts, and yes stretched my thinking. 
  * Yes 
  * Yes - the practical usefulness of the information provoked a lot of thinking. 
  * Yes - this class was really interesting and very hard. I never could just push it aside. In order to succeed I had to think about it all week long. 
  * No - I think one reason was the pace of the class the first 4 weeks. Homework were so lengthy and demanding and lectures were moving so fast. It was difficult to let material sink in and hence to be thoroughly stimulated by it. 
  * Yes - We have dealt with a lot of probabilities, modeling, data analysis, and this required our attention and deep thoughts and analysis. 
  * Yes - In CS we do not think much about numbers between 1 and 0. 
  * Yes - Mathematically challenging and abstract. 
  * Yes - Big intellectual challenge. 
  * Yes - Compared to other computer science requirements, this was higher paced and covered more abstract concepts. 
  * Yes - This class was insanely difficult. We need a textbook. 
  * Yes - Doing the homework problems was interesting. Also applications of material were interesting. 
  * No - Because statistic is boring. I mean it's really boring. 
**What aspects of this class contributed most to your learning?**

  * Homework and handouts are excellent. 
  * Handouts 
  * Homework and lectures. The handouts were good but the were a bit sparse. 
  * Lectures and examples. 
  * Simple and clear examples, and drill problems that reinforced these simple examples. 
  * Handouts. 
  * Lectures, handouts, homework and office hours all help me to understand class material better. 
  * The professor's enthusiasm was nice. She always seemed happy to be in class and excited about what she was teaching. The handouts were a nice reference too! 
  * The lectures. 
  * The usefulness of the ideas in most areas of CS. 
  * Doing the homework. Reading the handouts. I think it's difficult to passively absorb a stat lecture for 2 hours. _The schedule will be changed for 1 hr x 4 times a week_. 
  * I just took a quarter of probability last quarter, so the statistical elements of this class were a good complement to that. (stat = doing probability backwards). The handouts were also really helpful and very well related to lectures. Time well spent on your part, thanks. 
  * I found myself referring to the handouts to actually gain a working understanding of any concepts needed to solve the homework. I found the limitations of those notes to be direct limits on how well I could do the assigned problems. 
  * The handouts were useful. 
**What aspects of this class detracted from your learning?**

  * Using a book would be nice. _The absence of a textbook was an almost unanimous complaint. STAT 391 will have a textbook.(MMP)_ Handouts were brief. Sample code may have helped the other students. Notation was difficult. 
  * The lack of a comprehensive text a priori makes it really difficult to bind the information in such a way as to allow me to develop a well performing mental model. 
  * The lecture style took a couple of weeks to get used to. So much math is hard to digest so quickly, but it was still good to see. (i.e. I liked how you explained the implications of the proof attenthe derivation). 
  * I found the multitudes of notations difficult to parse. i.e. n , etc. I also think the lectures moved too quickly. Making sure we remember the math you are about to use would be helpful. 
  * Utility work, eg. learning to graph distribution. _There will be tuturials and sample code for this._ Complicated math. 
  * Frustrations with homework difficulty. Also 2 hr lectures are very hard. Do twice as many 1 hr lectures instead. 
  * I didn't know the flow of class. Perhaps a detailed calendar of lectures or a more thorough class syllabus could have helped. It was very easy to fall behind. The homeworks were extremely long and very discouraging at times. 
  * Minor confusions of notation, which cleared later, put me to spend more time than expected to understand correctly. 
  * Too much focus on the notation rather than the concepts. 
  * Brevity of handouts, unfamiliarity with notation, understanding handouts and assignments brief explanations for long problems. 
  * Tediousness of some parts of the homework. _Very likely you'll find the new edition of the homeworks easier, clearer and less frustrating in the details._
  * Lack of a textbook. Instructor's voice was a bit low so sometimes it was hard to hear. 2 hours for this is too long!!! Also, you may have considered 2 breaks at 45 mins apart. 
  * No textbook. 
  * Lecture is too long. Should be 1 hour 3 times a week. Doing statistics for 2 hours is difficult. Lack of textbook. 
**What suggestions do you have for improving the class?**

  * Change format of lecture to 1 hour MWF. Get a textbook for the class. More examples in class. 
  * Textbook. Homework assignments are too long!!! More application on assignments, less proof! 
  * A course outline and textbook. Though I did terribly and I had problems this quarter, that prevented me from making to class. I enjoyed this immensely and am glad that there was an interesting STAT course. 
  * Shorter homework. 
  * More examples that explain the ideas focus on mathematics that is rarely covered. Set theory, discrete math. Drill problems that explain and work upon ideas. Smaller and more focused projects. 
  * Put more emphasis on visual representation to understand the concepts. We spent a lot of time doing calculus to prove things. 
  * I wish to have the opportunity to study class handouts before coming to class. Also more office hours would be helpful. Thank you. 
  * A class outline, more examples, a textbook from which assignments come (or at least a required reading), more feedback on homeworks (perhaps homeworks solutions and an update to students on their grades. _Solutions for every homework were handed out together with the graded homeworks, in class. Where were you?_
  * 1 hour lectures. Homeworks that emphasize basics a little more. I never felt like I had those driven in. 
  * A class this small should become more personal but for some reason I felt hesitant to approach the teacher. 
  * Expand the handouts. Clarify examples. Give us refreshers on the mathematical forms you are using, i.e. matrix stuff, eigen values, etc. Not all of us took linear algebra last quarter. _Manysutdents wanted to see the handouts expanded. This will happen. The new edition of the handouts will be more comprehensive._
  * Strongly suggest MATH 394 before taking this class, it helped a lot. Also I found the Brshop book helpful as an alternative (sometimes prior) explanation of things. You could integrate it with the class more. Also, in lecture sometimes you ask if we have questions but I don't think anyone even knows what to ask questions about so quickly. Some prompting might be helpful. 
  * In the absence of a pre-existing text, take the notes you have and add greater development of key results as well as transitional material to link concepts. Also, standardized solution will be very helpful. 
  * Going over assignments in class would be helpful. 
_One can lie with statistics, one can also lie with citations. To avoid the
latter, I have reproduced here the students' comments entirely, without
editing. But what about the former kind of lie? If you don't want to be its
victim, you should **learn statistics**._

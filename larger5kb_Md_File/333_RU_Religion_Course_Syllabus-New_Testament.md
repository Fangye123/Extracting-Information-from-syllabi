**Course description and requirements**

This course is taught jointly by two professors, Professor Howard of Art
History and Professor Y¨¹ of Religion. We will examine the central features of
Buddhism from the perspectives of these two disciplines. Although this course
has been offered by the two professors separately before, this is the second
time that such an interdisciplinary approach has been applied to this course.
Whether you have registered for this course through the Art History or
Religion Department, you are expected to learn both the art historical and
religious materials and to meet the dual requirements.

This course introduces the growth and diffusion of Buddhism in India, China,
and Japan. The dissemination in these countries saw a continuous development
of the doctrine and the adaptation to the specific needs of each culture. Thus
in studying Buddhism in three countries we must pay equal attention to the
doctrinal developments as well as to varied interpretations of sacred spaces
(temples and cave-shrines) and images (frescoes and sculpture) which
constitute the arts of this religion. To understand this process of diffusion
and adaptation we will examine a number of key concepts and their artistic
expressions by using a selective number of monuments.

To start, we will consider the origin and meaning of Buddhism in India and use
the Sanchi stupa complex of the 1st century BC as an example of the early
phase of this religion which celebrated the life of the historical Buddha.
Comparisons will be drawn with other stupas, such as the earlier Bharhut and
the later Amaravati stupa. India also began the tradition of building
monasteries and devotional spaces in the mountain or hillside and embellishing
them with painting and sculpture. The image of the Buddha and the attendants
Bodhisattvas is fully established in these monuments. The cave temples of
Ajanta built around 475-500 AD are chosen to illustrate this tradition
emulated later on by most of the Buddhist countries of Asia.

Through the Silk Route which crosses the deserts and high mountain passes of
Central Asia, Buddhism penetrated China as early as the 1st century AD. By the
late 3rd \- early 4th century, Buddhism was already emerging as a local
religion with its own imagery and architecture. In China, we will study the
period between 400 and 750 AD and use the evidence of the cave temples of
Dunhuang and of the monumental complexes carved in the hill side of Yungang
and Longmen that the imperial house sponsored. The discussion of this material
highlights both the doctrinal and stylistic changes which  occurred in the
transition from Inida to China.

The concluding part of the course is devoted to Japan, the last stattion in
this long chain of transmission. Buddhism started flourishing in Japan by 550
AD benefiting from all the combined experiences of Inida and China. The
initial phase of Japanese Buddhism heavily depended on China: the Horyuji
temple built in the early 7th century and the Todaiji consecrated in 753 AD
are representative of this phase. In contrast, the Byoodo-in temple erected in
1053 embodies exclusively Japanese aesthetic and religious beliefs.

Contemplative Buddhism, called Zen in Japan, took a dimension of its own in
this country, acting simultaneously as a religion and a cultural force. We
will study Zen through the paintings of a few great masters of the Muromachi
period and especially the work of the 17th century master Hakuin.

**I. Reading**

This is in our opinion a hard course because it entails not just learning
about art, but also about a religion, which is unfamiliar to most of you, as
well as about the history and geography of Asia. If you decide to take this
course, you must commit yourself to do your utmost to meet the challenge.
Lecture notes are en essential tool in your preparation and therefore class
attendance is mendatory. We assume that each student has sufficient command of
English to be able to follow the lectures, take notes, and to express his/her
knowledge of the material in writing. It is equally important that you are
conscientious in keeping up with the reading assignments. Since there is not
one single textbook on our subject suitable for our purpose we have ordered
three required texts and placed more books on reserve.

 **II. Papers and Examinations**

There will be three in-class exams. These exams consist of identification of
slides and terms. You are required to label the slides shown, identifying the
work by giving date and location and briefly discuss their art historical
content. Similarly, for the traditions within Buddhism, as well as the
significance. Please take note that a mere description is not sufficient. If
you are not familiar with an art history or religion format we strongly urge
you to learn it before the exam.

Two short papers (3 to 4 pages) on a topic discussed in the course are due on
October 23rd and November 27th. They provide an opportunity for you to
synthesize and reflect on the readings and lectures. You should relate the
visual to textual material in your discussion as much as possible.

The Final Grade is based on the three exams (65%), the two papers (25%) and
the attendance (10%). No make-ups for a missed exam will be provided unless
there is a documented medical reason. The same applies to late papers. You are
encouraged to perform well in both disciplines. In order to get an A for this
course, you must score an A for both the Religion and the Art History
components of the course.

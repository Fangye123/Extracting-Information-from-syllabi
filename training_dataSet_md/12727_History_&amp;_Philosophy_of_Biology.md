### Course Description:

This course provides a broad survey of the history and philosophy of biology,
particularly those aspects of biology most directly related to natural history
and organismal biology. Issues related to medicine and biomedical ethics will
be given tangential coverage but are not central to the course. The course is
reading intensive and you can count on a minimum of four hours (150-200 pages)
of reading outside of class each week. Note also that the assigned reading is
"front-loaded," with a much heavier burden earlier in the semester. I did this
intentionally to allow more time for synthesis and speculation and to lighten
your loads late in the semester. I encourage you to get a head start on the
readings over break if at all possible (see syllabus link to study questions
for Mayr 1-146).

### Required Texts:

  * Mayr, E. 1982. ![](http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/serve?sourceid=42834&ISBN=0674364465) The growth of biological thought. Harvard University Press. 
  * Hull, D. & Ruse, M. 1998. ![](http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/serve?sourceid=42834&ISBN=0198752121) The philosophy of biology. Oxford University Press. 
  * Murphy, M.P. & O'Neill, L.A. 1997. ![](http://barnesandnoble.bfast.com/booklink/serve?sourceid=42834&ISBN=0521599393) What is life? the next fifty year: speculations on the future of biology. Cambridge University Press. 
  * Occasional supplemental readings will also be assigned when appropriate 

### Websites and additional materials:

  * List of key terms & concepts \-- developed and expanded over semester 
  * List of some seminal works and useful reviews [ **Note:** you may want to download and print a copy of this list for annotation during class discussions.] 
  * A chronology of significant biological events
  * Online texts of classic works in genetics \-- a great resource! 
  * Adaptationist stories website \-- interesting, but not especially rigorous 
  * Evolution and Creationism, a overview of issues and evidence. 
  * Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy
  * Molecules for Modern/Cellular Biology, a great site from Carnegie Mellon University featuring 3D animations of key biomolecules (requires download of the free Chime Netscape Plug-in. 

### Course overview and objectives:

  * to provide a summary of key events in the history of biology and to begin to understand how those events were related to prevailing social contexts 
  * to identify and grapple with some key conceptual issues in biology including 
    * the Panglossian paradigm (adaptationist interpretations) 
    * fitness tautologies 
    * optimization and constraint 
    * units and levels of selection 
    * teleology, teleonomy, and apparent design 
    * the mythogenic function of biology 
    * evolutionary epistemology 
  * to speculate about the future of biology (see our third text) 
  * to facilitate and encourage engagement of core assumptions of contemporary biological sciences 
  * to explore ethical issues posed by emerging biotechnologies 

### Expectations and Evaluation:

  * I expect: 
    1. assigned readings will be read prior to meetings -- weekly discussions and assignments will be based on reading and will assume that readings have been completed 
    2. you to take responsibility for your own learning -- ask questions about material you do not understand! 
  * Your grade will be based on how effectively each of the following criteria are met: 
    1. Participate in all (30%) and coordinate two (10% each) weekly sessions 
    2. A 2-3 page reaction paper based on a group-selected topic from our readings from Mayr (15%) 
    3. A 2-3 page reaction paper based on a group-selected topic from our readings from Hull & Ruse (15%) 
    4. A final critical essay (3-5 page) addressing issues raised during the course (individually selected in consultation with me - 20%) 
  * Coordinators are responsible for developing and distributing a list of study questions one week in advance of the relevant session (see example by following Week 1 link on syllabus). Coordinators are also expected to provide a brief verbal introduction to the to the week's topic and to keep the discussion focused and on-track.

**Some time between grade school and graduate school we move (hopefully) from
spoon-fed learning to self-directed inquiry. Has a topic we've discussed
piqued your curiousity? Use the links below to follow up on your interests
(see final essay assignment). You can begin with _Metacrawler_ to instantly
see what might be out there on the web, then come back and click the _Search
PALS_ banner to see what we have in our library. Finally, you can use the
_BarnesandNoble.com_ link to find and buy a paperback on the topic. Happy
reading!**

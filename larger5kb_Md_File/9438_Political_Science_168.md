Middle East Politics

_Purpose_ : Are Muslims inherently revolutionary and anti-American? Will Arab-
Israeli peace bring stability to the Middle East? Can Middle Eastern countries
deal with economic changes without political upheaval? Will oil prices go up
or down? Does the American presence in the region stabilize or de-stabilize
our allies? These questions, in the newspapers almost every day (OK, maybe not
in the _Free-Press_ every day), cannot be answered without understanding the
history of state formation in the Middle East. State formation in the Middle
East and the problems it has occasioned are the focus of this course. This is
a first course on the region; it presupposes no previous knowledge. The first
part of the course reviews the modern history of the region, with an emphasis
on state formation. The second part of the course examines a number of topics
of importance in the contemporary politics of the region, illustrated through
examination of the politics of a number of its countries.

_

Organization and Grading_: The course meets twice a week, one hour and fifteen
minutes per session (Tuesday/Thursday 2-3:15 PM). Participation in class
discussions and performance on a few quizzes will account for 20% of the final
grade for the course. Attendance at a special lecture by a visiting scholar on
the Middle East, scheduled for Monday October 18, will account for 5% of the
final grade (attendance at this lecture is obligatory for the course). Two
five-page essays during the semester will each be worth 20% of the final
grade. A short research paper on the current political-economic situation of a
Middle Eastern country, no more than 10 pages in length, will be worth 35% of
the final grade. The research paper will be due on December 13. There is no
final exam in this course. The in-semester essay questions and a description
of the research project are found at the end of the syllabus.

ESSAYS and FINAL PROJECT

_

a) Both essays and the final project must be double-spaced typed, with one-
inch margins at the top, bottom and sides of the pages. Letter size of the
font may be no smaller than the size used in this syllabus.

b) Length limits will be strictly observed.

c) The in-semester essays are analytical, not research-based. You need not
read anything but the assigned readings to write them. You do, however, have
to think about the assigned readings and the lectures in order to write good
essays.

d) The key to these essays is making an argument and supporting it with
references to the readings and lectures. Make sure that when you do refer
directly to a reading that you properly cite the author(s). A full citation is
not necessay. An abbreviated citation (eg.: Richards and Waterbury, p. 234, or
Azzam in Sidahmed and Ehteshami, p. 99) is sufficient. If you do cite a source
other than those included in the assigned readings, give the full citation.

e) The final project requires outside research in the library. I will inform
you of the most important sources to check to find information for your
project.

f) Do yourself a favor. Leave yourself enough time to write a first draft,
edit and cut it, and hand in the second draft.



_

First Essay_ \-- Choose one of the following. Due at the beginning of class
_October 12_. No more than 5 pages.

1\. What was the Ottoman legacy to the states of the modern Middle East? In
what ways has this legacy affected their political development?

2\. Are the states of the eastern part of the Middle East (Egypt to Iran;
Turkey to Yemen) "artificial"? If so, what are the political consequences of
that "artificiality" for their development. If not, why do so many people
think they are "artificial"?

  
_Second Essay_ \-- Choose one of the following. Due at the beginning of class
_November 18_. No more than 5 pages.

1\. Why did "Islam" become an important factor in the politics of so many
countries of the Middle East in the 1970's and 1980's? Why haven't there been
more Islamic revolutions on the model of Iran?

2\. Why has the Middle East in general not participated in the global trend
toward market-based, liberal economies? Can the Middle East continue to avoid
this global trend? If so, how? If not, why not?



_Final Project_ \-- No more than 10 pages; no fewer than 5 pages.

You are on the staff of either the Secretary of State or the chairman of the
board of Citibank (you choose). You have been asked to write a memo to your
boss on a Middle Eastern country (you can choose which one you want to write
about). In that memo you are to discuss: a) the political situation in the
country, including the challenges to stability and the prospects for
liberalization (if any); and b) the economic situation in the country,
particularly the fate of plans to implement market-oriented reforms (if any).
Be sure to explain why the country's leadership has chosen the political and
economic strategies it is following, and assess the prospects for the future.

Important sources to check: _Economist_ , _Middle East Economic Digest_ , _New
York Times_ , _Washington Post_ , International Monetary Fund data.

**OVERVIEW**

ENVS 262 examines different means of resolving and managing conflict over
environmental issues, drawing primarily on the rubric of alternative dispute
resolution (ADR) as an improvement over the conventional judicial system. This
course serves as both an intellectual introduction to ADR in the environmental
arena, and as an opportunity to gain hands-on experience with the theory and
practice of environmental negotiation. For those who wonder if solutions to
environmental problems are unattainable, this class provides a hallmark of new
directions for the field. ENVS 262 offers an unusual opportunity for
undergraduates to gain both a liberal arts, interdisciplinary perspective and
a set of marketeable skills in the realm of environmental problem-solving.
ENVS 262 is open to students who have taken ENVS 100 (Introduction to
Environmental Studies) (or by consent), and is offered for four credit hours.

**READINGS**

Three books are required for this class; all are available at the Slayter
Bookstore:  

Fisher, Ury, and Patton, 1991, _Getting to Yes_ (Penguin Books)     Susskind &
Cruikshank, 1987, _Breaking the Impasse_ (Basic Books)     Kane, 1995,
_Savages_ (Knopf).     There is also a build-your-own coursepack, available in
the McPhail Center Library (Barney 100) and copyable off-campus for a minimal
charge. Additional readings will be assigned as needed.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

Each student in ENVS 262 will be required to:  

  1. Participate in six short negotiation cases, including preparation of brief (2-4 page) individual post-exercise evalutions for each case, due at the beginning of the class following the exercise itself.  
_**36% of the total grade_**

  2. Write a research paper/case study on a (preferably local) environmental dispute.  
Due 10 November. Topic due 24 September. _**34% of the total grade_**

  3. Produce team position paper and participate in negotiated hearings for Ecuador  
Oil scenario (last month of term). Due 10 December. _**20% of the total
grade_**

  4. Participate in all class discussions: be active! _**10% of the total grade_**

Late penalties are assigned at a rate of 5% per day. Don't start assignments
late and get caught in a panic! You will get a handout for each assignment
well in advance of its deadline, and we'll discuss it in class. The research
paper assignment may involve a presentation during class near the end of the
term. Attendance is critical; the participation grade takes that into account.
The idea is to encourage everyone to talk, not to get a few people to talk
endlessly.

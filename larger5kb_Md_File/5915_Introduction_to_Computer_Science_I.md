#  Course Info

This course is intended as an introduction to the intellectual enterprise of
computer science with special attention to the art of computer programming. We
have three goals:

  * Teach problem solving through the development of algorithms. 

  * Teach computer programming as a means to express algorithms. 

  * Convey a broad picture of the different aspects of computer science. 

In the course of addressing these goals, we will cover:

  * The C programming language, and its idiomatic usage. 

  * Algorithms for searching, sorting, and other tasks. 

  * Techniques for the analysis of such algorithms. 

  * Devices for structuring data. 

  * The structure of computer systems. 

  * As time permits, we also hope to provide overviews of the following: 

    * The structure of networks of computers. 

    * The theoretical basis for computing. 

    * Computer security and cryptography. 

    * The simulation of human intelligence by computer. 

##  Workload, Prerequisites, and Placement

We believe that the range and depth of topics covered make the course
worthwhile, interesting, and stimulating, but the course is consequently quite
demanding. Students typically find that at least 10 hours per week (and
frequently more) are required to complete the assignments. Consequently,
taking this course at the same time as other major time commitments may not be
advisable.

The course has no prerequisites. In particular, you need not have prior
computer programming experience. However, if you have never programmed before,
you may find the course particularly challenging; plan on spending at least 15
hours per week to master the material. If you have programmed before, you
might find the course requires a bit less time, especially on earlier
assignments, but you will still find many assignments challenging and
interesting.

Occasionally, students with a strong C programming competency and a firm grasp
of programming concepts, as exhibited, for instance, by a 5 on the Computer
Science AB advanced placement exam, may skip CS50 and continue on with CS51 in
the spring. Students who are contemplating this option should speak with the
professor after class or during office hours.

The class is taught by Professor Stuart Shieber. It meets Monday, Wednesday
and Friday from 10:00am to 11:00am in Science Center Hall B.

##  Sections

There will be weekly sections where the teaching fellows will discuss problem
sets, material not fully covered in lectures, or difficult material. As part
of assignment 1, you will run our CS50 sectioning program. You must do this
part of the assignment by Wednesday, September 23 (the last day that study
cards are due). Once we have all the sectioning information, we will try to
arrange quad sections and river sections.

**Sections begin on 9/23.** For the first section you may attend any section.
Section meeting times and rooms are listed below. All these sections are in
the Science Center. It is very important that you go to section during the
second week of the course, because there is a tremendous amount of material to
learn, and the first assignment is due very soon after the term begins.

|   |   |  
  
  
  

##  Topic Sessions

Throughout the semester we will be offering extra ``topic sessions'' on an as-
needed basis, Friday afternoons (2-4pm in Science Center D). The material
presented will vary from week to week, but will be designed to familiarize
students with course-related tools, clarify information presented in lecture
and section, and discuss strategies pertinent to the assigned problem set.
These sessions will be extremely useful in keeping up with the coursework.

#  Course Requirements

##  Breakdown

There will be nine homework assignments, two hour exams, a final project, and
a final exam. Homework assignments and hour exams count 6% each. If you make a
good faith effort to do all nine assignments and you take both hourly
examinations, we will drop the lowest grade. You must pass the final exam in
order to pass the course.

  
  

Top 10 problem sets and exams | 60%  
---|---  
Project | 15%  
Final | 25%  
  
|  
  
##  Pass/Fail

You may take the course pass/fail. However, you must pass the final exam to
pass the course. A note of caution: if you take the course pass/fail, it will
not count towards concentration for computer science, applied math, and other
concentrations. Please check with your concentration in case of doubt.

##  Assignments

While the early assignments may seem simple, it is important that you develop
good work habits early in the semester. Students who breeze through the first
few assignments often have difficulty with the later, more difficult ones,
because they do not schedule their time well. The teaching fellows will use
section time to answer questions about the next week's assignment and to give
you tips on how to approach it. If you have not read the assignment, you will
not get as much out of section as you can. Please read the assignment
carefully before coming to section.

##  Due Dates

Assignments are usually due 24 hours before your section. (The assignment will
clearly state the due date.) That means that the electronic submit time on
your assignments must be no later than 24 hours before the beginning of
section. You must turn in both electronic and paper copies of assignments. You
may turn the hardcopy in during your section, but the time of submission is
what is recorded electronically.

Each year, we get complaints from students that it is unfair to have
assignments due on different days, that it gives those in sections toward the
end of the week an unfair advantage. After watching student behavior and
computer usage over many years, we believe this to be the best policy. It
tends to spread the computer usage over the week and avoids the situation
where all 300 of you are trying to use the Science Center systems
simultaneously. To be as equitable as possible, all sections have been
scheduled between lecture on Wednesday and lecture on Friday. We suggest that
you begin assignments as soon as possible to avoid the bottleneck that
inevitably occurs as due dates approach.

##  Late Days

Late work causes trouble for us and trouble for you. If you get behind at the
beginning of the semester, you will not have enough time for the more
difficult assignments at the end of the semester. However, certain weeks can
be dreadful, and we understand that. You will each be given five ``free
extension days.'' You may use these days on any assignment, with the exception
of the final project, without being assessed any late penalty. After you have
exhausted your ``free'' days, you will be assessed a 10% penalty per day that
an assignment is late. The following bullet items detail how ``free days'' may
and may not be used:

  * Days are not divisible. One minute late is identical to 24 hours late. 

  * Late days are assigned to the first five days any assignments are late. You will not be able to trade a late day for the 10% penalty. 

  * Late days may not be taken on the final project. 

  * If you have a severe illness or an emergency that forces you to be away from campus, then contact Penny Ellard and request an extension. Extensions will be granted only for cases that were beyond your control. 

##  Final Project

The final project will provide you with the opportunity to apply what you have
learned in this course to your life outside of Computer Science 50\. You will
be expected to hand in a project proposal before Thanksgiving and the project
will be due during reading period. You will get more information about the
project as the semester progresses. For now, just realize that the final
project is worth about two and one-half homework assignments. We do not expect
you to produce the next major breakthrough in computer software. Think simple!

##  Collaboration Policy

You may discuss problem sets with classmates, but you cannot share code.
Typically, if you communicate in English with a friend, this is fine; if you
are communicating in C, you have crossed the line. We automatically check for
similar assignments. You **must** turn in your own work.

#  Course Texts

##  Required Texts

  * _The Art and Science of C: A Library-Based Introduction to Computer Science_ , Roberts, available at the Coop. 

This is the main text for the course.

  * _The Internet,(2nd Edition)_ , Comer, available at the Coop. 

This is a terrific introduction to networking and the net.

  * _The C Programming Language, 2nd Edition_ , Kernighan & Ritchie, available at the Coop. 

This is the seminal work on the C language (and is colloquially called ``K &
R''). For many years, the only definition of the C language was whatever
appeared here. It is a very concise description of the language. It is
designed for people who already know how to program. You will find it an
invaluable reference.

  * _Harley Hahn's Student Guide to UNIX_ , Hahn, available at the Coop. 

This is a terrific introduction to the UNIX operating system. Although we do
not assign the entire book during the semester, we strongly encourage you to
work your way through it as the semester progresses.

##  Information Sheets

The following information sheets are available in the Science Center from User
Services. You will probably want to obtain one or more of them.

  * UNIX for New Account Holders: Information on obtaining an account, choosing a password, logging in and out, printers, disk quotas, and other useful information. 

  * Basic UNIX Commands 

  * PINE: The Basics 

  * VI Quick Reference 

  * Introduction to EMACS 

#  Syllabus

  * The syllabus below is preliminary, and is subject to change. 

  * If no date is specified for the problem set, it is due 24 hours **before** section during the week shown. 

  * Reading Period begins 1/4/99. 

  * Exam Period begins 1/18/99.

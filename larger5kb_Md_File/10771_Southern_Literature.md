**[LANGUAGE OF THE LAND](http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/land/) **

"Using maps and photographs from the collections of the Library of Congress
(LOC), this exhibition documents the connections between America's geography
and its literature. The exhibit was inspired by LOC's collection of literary
maps, and it begins with several of these accompanied by quotations, such as
Gertrude Stein's observation, 'In the United States there is more space where
nobody is than where anybody is. That is what makes America what it is.' The
remainder of the exhibition consists of four regional sections, Northeast,
[South](http://lcweb.loc.gov/exhibits/land/landsout.html), Midwest (featuring
an opening quote from Jack Kerouac and a drawing that looks like Laura from
Little House on the Prairie), and West." (Description by Martha Hopkins and

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
Historical survey of the visual arts and architecture from pre-history to
around 1450 in the Mediterranean world and Europe, Asia, Africa, and the
preColumbian Americas.  
  
**REQUIRED:  
ART HISTORY, Vol. I, SECOND EDITION ** by Marilyn Stokstad (at the Bookie)  
NOTE: Be sure to purchase the Second Edition (not the First Edition or the
Revised Edition). The page numbers and illustration numbers are NOT THE SAME!

**CLASS SYLLABUS** (what you are looking at right now!). This has ALL the
information you will need concerning the course, including exams and the paper
assignment. Please bring this sheet, as well as printouts of the **[Paper
Info](201paper.html), [Midterm #1 Info](201mt1.html), and [Study
Guide](../study.html) linked pages to class on Tuesday, Aug. 27th. **  
  
Class meetings will be organized around a lecture format with opportunities
for questions and discussion. It is essential that students read the assigned
sections in the text before the class meetings so they will be familiar with
the material in the text and for the pop quizzes. **Material from both the
text and from class lectures is included in exams.**  
  
**COURSE GOALS:**  
1\. To recognize works of art from major world art traditions from pre-history
through the Middle Ages, including the title, culture, period, and artist (if
known).  
2\. To appreciate the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic
factors which impact artists' choices in subject, symbolism, and style across
time and space.  
3\. To investigate issues of gender, race, patronage, etc. as they relate to
the role of the artist and the art works.  
4\. To develop skills for evaluating and analyzing works of art, both in terms
of visual analysis (line, color, composition, etc.) and in their expressive
content, their subject matter.  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS (read carefully).  
There are two tracks for this class. You choose the one you wish to pursue.  
  
TRACK 1 NON-PAPER: **  
**2 Midterm examinations** (objective slide identification, essay): 60 points
each / 120 points total  
**Final Exam*** (objective slide identification, essay): 85 points  
**Pop quiz/attendance:** 15 points needed to be accumulated through
unannounced pop quizzes worth 2 points each, and attendance.  
**Total: 220 possible points**  

**TRACK 2[PAPER](201paper.html)**  
**2 Midterm examinations** (objective slide identification, essay): 60 points
each /120 points total  
**Final Exam*** (objective slide identification, essay): 85 points  
**Paper assignment:** 80 points  
**Pop quiz/attendance:** 15 points needed to be accumulated through
unannounced pop quizzes worth 2 points each, and attendance.  
**Total: 300 possible points  
**

*** Final Exam is scheduled for Tuesday, December 17th, 7-9 PM.  
**  
**REASONS WHY CHOOSING THE "PAPER TRACK" MAY BE A GOOD IDEA: **  
1) you need a paper for your writing portfolio  
2) you need practice in writing in general, in learning English, or both  
3) you don't "test" well, especially on multiple choice exams, but you do
write well; so choosing this option could definitely help you get a better
grade  
3) there is an art work that has always fascinated you and you want to know
more about it  
4) you enjoy the challenge and rewards of learning something in greater depth  
  
**NOTE:  
The grades are NOT curved. You earn your grade with each assignment. ** Make-
up examinations are given only for serious medical or family emergency
situations and must be taken within a reasonable time period after the test
has been given (preferably within one week). Please inform us before the exam,
if possible.  
  
**Failure to complete any component will result in a grade of ZERO for that
assignment. Cheating (including but not limited to the use of "crib sheets",
copying other students' work, or plagiarism) will result in FAILURE OF THE
COURSE. **Cheating involving other students will be referred to the
appropriate university officials.  
  
We are happy to accommodate special needs (physical, language, etc.). Please
see Dr. Ivory as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester.

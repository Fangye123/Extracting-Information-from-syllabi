**Prerequisites** Mathematics 760-143 (Finite Mathematics), 760-152
(Elementary Functions), or concurrent registration in 760-253 (Calculus I). In
general, solid logical and problem solving skills are required for success in
this course.

|  **Course Waiver** This course along with Computer Applications (765-162) is
a prerequisite for entry into courses offered in the MCS major. Prospective
MCS majors who feel that they have already mastered the material covered in
this course can have this prerequisite waved, freeing up time in their
schedule for another course. Students interested in receiving a waver for
either 162 or 171 should contact Dr. J. Kane (send e-mail inquiries to
kanej@mail.uww.edu).

|  **Text** _Turbo Pascal--Programming and Problem Solving_ , by Mickey Settle
and Michel Boillot. We will cover selected sections from Chapters 1-10.
Computers are available for your use in the basement of McGraw Hall and
Anderson Library. **Visit the labs soon to get acquainted with the PCs
there.**

|  **Required Supplies** You will need three 3.5" diskettes, IBM format, and a
velcro-closure envelope folder (please get the 9.5"x12" size that fits normal
8.5"x11" letter size paper - the larger 15" size won't fit in my briefcase!).
Disks ($1.00) and folders ($1.75) can be purchased at the bookstore.

|  **Purpose of Course** This course is designed to be a first professional
course in computer programming. We will discuss many important topics: top-
down design, modularization of programs, proper program construction and
style, program documentation, proper program logic and loop control, use of
user-defined functions and procedures, defining and using one and two
dimensional arrays, simple string handling in Turbo Pascal, working with
sequential files, and using records. Warning: this course is not merely
_about_ programming computers--you will be actively engaged in the program
creation process! As such, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done in
this course. You will learn how to plan a solution to a problem using a
computer program and then implement that solution using Turbo Pascal.

|  **Homework** Homework will be assigned daily (a [course
schedule](schedule.html) is available) and some class time will be devoted to
answering questions on previously assigned work. It will be impossible to
cover every detail of all the questions which are asked. If yours was not
answered, or you still don't understand, see me during office hours or make an
appointment for a more convenient time. To be of maximum educational benefit,
homework should always be done as if it were to be handed in. Sloppy work,
messy notation, and leaving-out-of-steps practiced on homework is very hard to
avoid under the pressure of an exam. Although homework will not be collected
or graded, a great many questions on the exams will be modeled on the homework
problems assigned in the text.

|  **Evaluation**

    
    
            Hour Exams: 3 @ 150 pts each:   450
            Programs:                       450
            _Final Exam:                     500_
            Total:                         1400
    

Your final course grade will be assigned as follows: A: 90% or better; B: 80 -
89%; C: 70 - 79%; D: 60 - 69%; F: below 60%. Passing course grades will be
awarded only to those students who **turn in all programming assignments** and
**take all scheduled examinations**. **Dates for the hour exams have already
been set (see the[course schedule](schedule.html))**. If you know you will be
absent the day of an exam, please talk to me beforehand or leave a message to
make arrangements to take the exam.

|  **Attendance, Testing and Grading** Because most students find a first
course in programming challenging, regular class attendance in this course is
strongly encouraged! Your semester grade will be based on the total points you
earn: exams, quizzes and in-class work, computer programs, and the final exam.
You may use a calculator on all exams. Programs turned in late will normally
incur severe late penalties. Students with legitimate excuses which prevent
them from turning in work or taking exams must call me or send word as soon as
possible describing the problem. Usually, something can be worked out to
everyone's satisfaction when sufficient prior notification is made.

|  **Make-up Policy** If needed, any make-up tests will be given on one of the
authorized make-up days during final exam week. For those situations not
covered by the policies shown below for accommodation of religious beliefs and
scheduled university events, I will be the sole judge of whether a make-up
test will be permitted.

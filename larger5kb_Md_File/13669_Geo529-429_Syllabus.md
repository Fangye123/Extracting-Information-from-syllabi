****Reconstructing Historical Landscapes****

This seminar will examine the use of historical methods to interpret the
physical, ecological, social, and cultural conditions of regions within the
historical past. While this research seminar will focus broadly on the methods
employed by historians and others to interpret the past, we shall place
special emphasis on using historical techniques to uncover the environmental
conditions of particular landscapes at earlier times.

Topics to be addressed in this seminar include environmental history;
historical inquiries into material culture; the utilization of archival,
narrative, photographic sources, and census data; and the history of urban
regions.

  
  
This course satisfies the Resource Geography distribution requirements in the
Department of Geosciences.

**_  
Requirements_ _:_**

This is a discussion seminar. Because the success of this course will depend
on students being prepared to discuss readings, it is imperative that all
reading assignments be completed before seminar meetings. All students will
write a one-page paper (circa 250 words) each week, based on a pre-assigned
theme, that addresses the week's reading; these are due at the start of class
each Monday.

Seminar members will also prepare a research paper (for undergraduates, 12-16
pages, double-spaced, roughly 250 words per page, in Courier type 10 or
equivalent; for graduate students, 20-25 pages), whose topic will be chosen in
consultation with the instructor. Careful identification of critical problems
and high standards of analysis are expected. This paper will be due at the end
of the quarter; the final deadline shall be Monday, June 5, at 4 PM, in the
Department of Geosciences, 104 Wilkinson. All students will also make an oral
presentation and lead a brief class discussion of their analysis and
conclusions. These presentations will be concentrated in the final two weeks
of the seminar.

_Grading and evaluation_ : There will be no mid-term or final exam. In their
stead, grades will be based on the following: the research paper (50% of
grade), oral presentations in seminar and weekly (brief) essays (30%), and
participation in general class discussions (20%).

In addition, all students are requested to create an email account for
themselves if you have not done so already (these accounts are free to all
enrolled students). Throughout the term email announcements of general
interest, including notices of lectures and research opportunities, will be
broadcast to all seminar participants.

  
_Prerequisites_ : Senior or graduate student standing required for enrollment.

One of the  
problems is - how do you find out what those past temperatures were? NPR's

that the oceans are  
warming up as well as the atmosphere. {4:30}**

Edwards talks to Dino Brugioni, a  
former senior officer of the CIA's National Photographic Interpretation  
Center about his new book, "Photo Fakery: The History and Techniques  
of Photographic Deception and Manipulation." Brugioni says people have  
been tampering with photos in order to fool or entertain others since the  
invention of photography. People and objects can be put in or taken out of  
pictures, or events can be staged for the camera. Brugioni says some  
manipulations in recent years...including the darkening of O.J. Simpson's  
mug shot on the cover of a national news magazine...can call into  
question the credibility of the news media. (7:17)

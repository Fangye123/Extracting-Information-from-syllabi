**_Course Overview:_**

This seminar will explore the complicated way in which some nineteenth-century
writers attempted to construct and stabilize the concept of "masculinity" or
"manliness." Necessarily, we will also explore a number of writers who
dedicated themselves to disrupting and challenging these norms. The course
title uses the plural, in other words, because this course is grounded in the
assumption (an easy one to demonstrate) that Victorian culture generated a
variety of different and often conflicting models of "manliness." Moreover,
these models of manliness seem to play increasingly important roles in a wide
variety of important social and cultural movements over the course of the
century, from the emergence of a middle class patriarchy to the development of
feminist consciousness to the creation of the Aestheticist movement. We will
be reading many different types of texts -- poetry, prose, and novels; some
written by men, some by women -- and will attempt to survey this topic in as
much of its variety as we can within the time constraints. |

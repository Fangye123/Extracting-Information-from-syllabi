### A note from the Chairman:

We are excited about having you here, and I hope you are excited about being
here ! You are now part of the "Best of the Best." The WIU LEJA program is
nationally recognized as one of the "Best" programs in the country. At WIU we
are the largest department by far. One out of nine students at WIU is a LEJA
major. LEJA has the most honor students of any program on campus and the
highest graduation ratio within four years and three and one-half years. LEJA
has the most Grad Trac students at the university. We offer a full schedule of
summer courses and have the most internship sites available of any department.

Our program stresses preparation in both theory and practice. Faculty members
possess a unique combination of diverse degrees and practical experiences in
various fields, such as corrections, security, juvenile, probation,
intelligence, and policing.

I encourage you to get involved in our professional associations, like the
American Society of Industrial Security, the American Criminal Justice
Association/Lambda Alpha Epsilon, the Investigators Club, the Corrections
Club, or the Alpha Phi Sigma/National Criminal Justice Honor Society. The WIU
campus offers a wide variety of other activities, including athletics, plays,
concerts, clubs, and societies representing a broad spectrum of interests.

Being part of the "Best," we expect you to act your best. I have an open door
policy, so if you need assistance, please feel free to come to Stipes Hall
403. Have a mighty fine school year.

Stephen J. Reinhart, Chairman

### **WELCOME TO WESTERN ILLINOIS UNIVERSITY  
AND THE  
DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND JUSTICE ADMINISTRATION**

The faculty and staff of the Department of Law Enforcement and Justice
Administration wish to welcome you to Western Illinois University and to our
department. We hope that this year will be a successful one for you. We
encourage you to seek out assistance at any time you need it. Please, feel
free to contact the advisers and instructors in our department when you have a
problem or question.

Your LEJA professors will announce their office hours in class, have them
documented on the course syllabus and post them on their office doors. The
LEJA Department Office in Stipes 403 is open from 7:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.,
Monday through Friday. The phone number is (309) 298-1038. The WIU Regional
Center is located at 3561 60th Street, Moline, IL 61265. The phone number for
the Regional Center is (309) 762-9481.

This Law Enforcement and Justice Administration Student Handbook has been
designed to help acquaint you with the Department of Law Enforcement and
Justice Administration. It should be used in conjunction with the University
Student Handbook and the Western Illinois University Undergraduate Catalog.
The University Student Handbook is designed in a calendar format and is a
handy reference manual for you throughout this academic year.

The final authority in determining the requirements for your degree is the
Western Illinois University Undergraduate Catalog, which was in effect the
semester you began your college career, providing you have no interruptions
longer than two semesters excluding summer. Transfer students may use the
catalog in effect the year they first enrolled in college, as long as it was
no more than three years before they transferred to Western, and they were
continuously enrolled for this three year period with no interruptions longer
than two semesters excluding summer. However, if your needs are met with a
more recent catalog, you have the option of appealing to change catalogs.
Discuss this procedure with your adviser.

Additionally, the Fall Semester Class Schedule booklet and the Spring Semester
Class Schedule booklet should be kept throughout the semester for reference to
important dates (i.e., drop dates, holidays, beginning of second 8-week
classes, finals week, computer labs, important telephone numbers, etc.).

Finally, all students need to examine their Western's Audit of Requirements
for Degree (WARD) Report that is available through the STARS computer labs or
their Academic Adviser. This report details which courses the student has
taken in the past, and what the student will need to take to graduate.

Changes in services, policies, procedures and activities are posted on
bulletin boards in Sherman Hall, the University Union, residence halls, in
classroom buildings, and on the [Advising Web
Site](http://www.wiu.edu/coehsadvising). Information pertinent to LEJA majors
and minors can be found in the Advising Center at 99 - Horrabin Hall,
Internship Coordinator's office - Stipes Hall 330 and posted on the bulletin
boards outside the LEJA Department office - Stipes Hall 403. It is your
responsibility to check these locations and the advising center's web site
periodically.

### **ACADEMIC ADVISING**

A file containing each LEJA major's academic records, WARD Report, and a
program planning sheet is maintained in the advising office (99 Horrabin
Hall). It is strongly recommended that all students also keep a personal file
of their own. The Academic Advisers are available to help students plan their
degree program and help with any other concerns you might have such as
information on Academic Assistance Centers or other University services
offered.

University policy states all students must meet with their academic adviser a
of minimum one time each semester prior to registration for the following
semester. Due to the large numbers of LEJA majors, please make an appointment
EARLY to see your adviser. To make an appointment, call 298-1438.

Your academic adviser will be a resource for you. Stacy Dorsett, Donna Wynn
and Betty Dean, the LEJA Advisers for the Macomb campus, are located in 99
Horrabin Hall and take appointments from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., Monday
through Friday. Quick questions can be addressed during walk-in times.
Advising appointments are for working out semester schedules, etc. You can
contact your adviser via e-mail for quick questions as well: [BA-
Dean@wiu.edu](mailto:BA-Dean@wiu.edu), [SE-Dorsett@wiu.edu](mailto:SE-
Dorsett@wiu.edu), and [DK-Wynn@wiu.edu](mailto:DK-Wynn@wiu.edu).

At the Macomb campus your adviser is based on your academic status. Betty Dean
will see all freshmen students with 0-30 credit hours, Stacy Dorsett and Donna
Wynn will see all students who have completed 30+ credit hours (sophomores -
seniors). Graduate students have a faculty adviser. Please contact the
department office for the faculty adviser information.

Quad Cities students have seperate advisers. Kim Moreno and Shelby Hoover
Newberry work with a variety of different majors in addition to Law
Enforcement. At the Quad Cities, the adviser split the students according to
the alphabet: Kim Moreno works with students whose last name begins with A-L,
and Shelby Hoover Newberry works with students whose last name begins with
M-Z. Both advisers are located on the 2nd floor in the Advising Center and
take appointments from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Quick questions can be addressed
during walk-in times. Advising appointments are for working out semester
schedules, etc. To make an appointment call 309-762-9481. You can also contact
your adviser via e-mail for quick questions as well:
[S-HooverNewberry@wiu.edu](mailto:S-HooverNewberry@wiu.edu) and [KM-
Moreno@wiu.edu](mailto:KM-Moreno@wiu.edu).

**Transfer Students**

All students transferring to Western from another school receive two copies of
an "Official Notice of Transfer Credit" from Western's Admission Office. This
notice is a listing of all courses taken elsewhere in terms of Western's
course numbers. It is very important that one of the copies be given to your
adviser as soon as possible. Proper advising is not possible without this
notice of credit earned. Drop the "Adviser's Copy" off at the Advising Center
in 99 Horrabin Hall as soon as possible so your file can be updated. Be
certain to keep your copy of the transfer evaluation so that you may refer to
it later. You never want to repeat a course.

**Pre-Registration & Registration for Classes**

In April or November (depending on the semester) on-campus students in good
standing and un-encumbered, will have the opportunity to pre-register for next
semester's courses on STARS by appointment only. Students register for Summer
classes at the same time they register for Fall classes. Schedule books,
listing the courses that will be offered the following semester, are
distributed in the mailboxes, before pre-registration begins, to all students
living in residence halls. Off-campus students may pick up schedule booklets
in the Registration Center (basement of Memorial Hall).

Your registration appointment may be found by logging on to the STARS
registration program in any University computer lab. The STARS registration
program will tell you the earliest date and time you may access the
registration program to pre-register for classes. Pre-registration times are
assigned by the Registrar according to the accumulative hours earned as of the
end of the preceding semester. Those students with the most hours have the
opportunity to pre-register first and those with the least hours pre-register
last.

You must not be encumbered at the time of your pre-registration appointment,
and you must be in good standing with the University. _You need to plan your
schedule with your adviser prior to the pre-registration period._ _ **Do not
wait**_ until the pre-registration period starts to see your adviser, or you
may miss your pre-registration appointment. _**Call early**_ in the semester
to make an appointment to talk with your adviser about your next semester's
schedule and to get your adviser encumbrance removed for registration. Call
298-1438 and ask for an appointment.

**Special Permission Classes**

All 300/400 level classes in LEJA require special permission prior to
enrollment for _Pre-LEJA students and LEJA minors_. Each semester prior to
full acceptance to the LEJA program, you must submit a copy of the **Request
for Authorization Form** to the Advising Office in 99 Horrabin Hall. These
forms are available from the LEJA advisers. Those Pre-LEJA students who are
completing 60+ hours and who have a minimum overall GPA of 2.5 will be
processed. All forms will be evaluated using department requirements.

_LEJA students_ , those who have full acceptance to the major, do not need to
file Special Permission forms. However, those students must have adviser
encumbrances lifted as per usual.

_Students who do not meet department requirements (Pre-LEJA)_ to enroll in
300/400 level courses will not be given Authorization forms. Those students,
during the advising appointment, will be given options on classes to take for
the following semester.

An appeals process is available for those students who have documented
extenuating situations, such as illness or death in the family, for not
reaching the minimum GPA. **Undergraduate Student Selection and Retention
Committee Forms** are available in the Advising Office in Horrabin Hall 99.
All appeals are evaluated, on an individual basis, by the committee. Should
your appeal be approved, you will have electronic permission to enroll for
that class on the STARS system. That is, clearance will be given on the
computer system for you to enroll yourself. You will also be notified in
writing as to whether your appeal was approved or denied. If your appeal is
denied you may make an appointment with your Adviser to discuss possible
options.

For more information about this process, please see the [additional web
page](LEJA-Pg2.htm) on this process.

**Closed LEJA Classes**

If the LEJA class you desire should close before you have an opportunity to
register, and all other sections of that course are filled, you may fill out a
closed class request form. These forms will be available to fill out in the
Advising Office in 99 Horrabin Hall and require instructor's signature for
approval.

**DO NOT CALL THE LEJA PROFESSORS FOR THIS FORM. ONLY ADVISERS HAVE THE
NECESSARY PAPERWORK. PLEASE SEE THE APPROPRIATE OFFICE FOR THIS FORM AND FOR
INFORMATION.**

If you desire a closed class that is NOT in the LEJA department, you need to
get permission from that particular department or instructor. Closed Class
Permission forms for LEJA are available from the advisers in Horrabin Hall
#99.

**Independent Study**

Independent study (LEJA 404) was created to allow a student to study in-depth
a particular phase or experience of the criminal justice system and/or
security administration that is not covered in the classroom.

> To be eligible for independent study you must have all of the following:

>

>> 1\. Completed at least 90 semester hours of credit prior to the term in
which you desire to take the independent study.  
> 2\. Completed at least four LEJA courses.  
> 3\. Have an 2.5 GPA or above.

>

> To register for independent study you must:

>

>> 1\. Obtain permission from the LEJA Chairperson. When permission is
obtained you will be given electronic permission to enroll for LEJA 404 on the
STARS system.  
> 2\. Submit a written proposal of what you would like to study to the
professor of record in the term prior to the one in which you desire to take
the independent study.

Independent study is completed through one of several methods: (1) a research
paper, (2) book reviews, (3) a research project, (4) abstracts of articles, or
(5) a practical experience not available through the internship program.

**Questions and Answers**

In addition to your Academic Adviser, many answers to your questions can be
found in the University Student Handbook, the Western Illinois University
Undergraduate Catalog and your WARD report. You may also access the WIU
website at: <http://www.wiu.edu/> or the LEJA website at:
[www.wiu.edu/users/mileja](http://www.wiu.edu/users/mileja) for additional
information.

The Advising Center also has a web site which is updated frequently. For
current information, please check this site periodically:
[www.wiu.edu/coehsadvising](http://www.wiu.edu/coehsadvising).

**KEEP THESE PUBLICATIONS AND REFER TO THE WEB PAGES OFTEN FOR INFORMATION AND
ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS. **

### **GRADTRAC  
WIU's Four-Year Graduation Guarantee**

Western Illinois University's Macomb campus has developed an exciting program
designed to help you complete your undergraduate degree in four (4) years or
less. The University is committed to helping you graduate in a timely fashion
and has developed Gradtrac to enable you to achieve this goal. In order to
complete your degree in four years, you will be required to take personal
initiative during your years at Western.

**Eligibility**

Most incoming freshmen are eligible for this program and are given a copy of
the Gradtrac contract at registration. Only regularly admitted freshmen are
eligible to apply; transfer students are not eligible. Students who began at
WIU during the Fall '99 semester or after can enroll in Gradtrac with
adviser's verification and permission from the college dean and department
chair.

**Student Responsibilities**

  * Enroll in and maintain an average of 15-16 hours of course work each semester that applies toward degree requirements;   

  * You may apply credit by external or internal examinations (i.e. CLEP, CEEB, and PEP) and departmental proficiency examinations toward the requirements of Gradtrac; 
  * Meet all the academic requirements of your major, minor, your college and university including the grade point requirements defined by your college and/or program; 
  * Meet deadlines and requirements of Gradtrac, and regularly monitor your progress toward graduation. Such monitoring includes timely meetings with your academic adviser at least once each semester, prior to each pre-registration; 
  * Take responsibility for making and keeping required appointments and advising sessions; 
  * Consult with your adviser before dropping or adding a course; 
  * Accept any available class section that fits your schedule and register for classes at your assigned pre-registration time; 
  * The following encumbrances can prevent you from registering on time: financial, immunization, administrative, housing, judicial, athletic, advising. Be sure these are taken care of prior to pre-registration; 
  * Accept responsibility for timely annual application for all necessary financial assistance; 
  * Complete approximately one-fourth of the applicable credits for your degree program each year as set out in your Gradtrac four-year degree plan; 
  * Transfer and summer credits may count toward Gradtrac requirements. 

**University Responsibilities**

If, after working with your adviser, it appears that graduation may be delayed
due to the unavailability of a course, you may obtain the requisite form from
your adviser and file it with that adviser no later than two working days
after the end of the published pre-registration period. The form will be
forwarded to the department chair and college dean.

If you meet all the conditions of the four-year plan but are unable to
graduate due to the unavailability of a course, the University will offer one
of the following options:

  * Allow you to graduate in four years by substituting a different course or an appropriate independent study assignment, as determined by the department and the college offering your major. 
  * Allow you to graduate in four years by waiving the requirements to be met by the unavailable course, as determined by the department and college offering you major. 
  * If your college or department is unable to effect a waiver or substitution that will allow you to graduate in four years, the University will waive the tuition for the course or courses still needed, if taken at Western Illinois University. 

These procedures will be the exclusive remedy for fulfillment of the Gradtrac
agreement. The University is under no obligation to make any of the above
outlined adjustments unless you submit the requisite form requesting an
accommodation to the Dean of your college before the beginning of classes in
the last term of your approved four-year plan.

**Changing Majors & Updating Gradtrac Contracts**

You may change majors if the dean of the new program verifies in writing that
you can complete all remaining requirements within the time line specified by
the Gradtrac agreement.

The change of majors, major options, major emphases or minors requires the
filing of a new Gradtrac contract. The new agreement/contract must be filed
with signatures from the appropriate adviser, chair and dean.

You may enroll in an additional major or minor or in programs leading to
additional licensing and certification, if you can complete all of these
requirements within the four years specified by the Gradtrac agreement. You
must consult with your academic adviser in a timely manner in order to
accomplish these changes or additions.

### **INTERNSHIP - LEJA 490& 491**

One of the highlights of the LEJA program is the full-time internship which is
required of all LEJA majors. It is during the internship that students often
have an opportunity to more fully understand the principles learned in the
classroom and to apply them to an actual criminal justice agency. The
internship program offers students an opportunity for on-the-scene observation
of practitioners at their work. It provides the practitioners an opportunity
to interact with students who have devoted their college time and effort
toward attaining a professional degree in criminal justice. Cooperation of
this type between educators and law enforcement will greatly enhance the move
forward for the greater professionalization of law enforcement.

The internship experience is the combination of LEJA 490 and LEJA 491\. LEJA
490 (12 semester hours - graded satisfactory or unsatisfactory) is the field
experience portion of the internship and is fifteen weeks in length (12 weeks
during the Summer Semester). During this period an intern will spend forty
hours per week as a participant-observer with a selected agency. LEJA 491 (3
semester hours - graded A, B, C, D or F) involves completion of the Internship
Paper, a Professional Resume, cover letter and typed Weekly Activity Reports.
One goal of the internship experience is to help students better prepare
themselves for employment in their chosen field.

**Eligibility**

Students may take part in the internship after completing 90 hours of course
work and have full acceptance to the LEJA major. Pre-LEJA students may not
attend an internship meeting until they have achieved the necessary GPA and
coursework needed to be considered LEJA majors. Included in the course work
must be the following courses: LEJA 101, 212, 242, 303, 306, and 312.
Additionally, transfer students must have completed a minimum of five LEJA
courses at WIU prior to interning. Also, LEJA majors must maintain the 2.5
LEJA GPA and 2.25 Overall GPA during the semester they are applying for
internship. Students must apply one full semester prior to the internship.

**Applying for Internship**

The Internship may be completed during the Fall, Spring, or Summer Semester. A
mandatory internship meeting is held within the first three weeks of each Fall
and Spring Semester. Students selecting Summer or Fall Semester for their
internship should attend the meeting held the preceding Spring Semester which
is usually held early in February. Students selecting the Spring Semester for
internship should attend the meeting held the preceding Fall Semester which is
usually held early in September. At all of these meetings, the Internship
Coordinator will explain the materials that students must complete and will
provide further information on the internship experience. Notices of these
meetings will be posted in 99 Horrabin Hall, Stipes Hall 330, announced in
LEJA classes, and posted on the [COEHS Advising web site](LEJAinternmtg.htm).
_You MUST attend one of these meetings to apply for the internship._

Example:

Spring | Fall | Spring  
---|---|---  
2.5 LEJA  
2.25 Overall | 2.5 LEJA  
2.25 Overall | 2.5 LEJA  
2.25 Overall  
Establish GPA | Apply for Internship  
(Mandatory Mtg.) | Attend Internship  
  
**Assignments**

More than 1,000 criminal justice agencies throughout the United States have
participated in the LEJA internship program. All types of criminal justice
agencies are represented: municipal, state, and federal law enforcement,
security, correctional and juvenile agencies, planning commissions and
attorneys. From the approved list of participating internship agencies
students are allowed to select the agency they prefer. This list is available
from your Adviser or Internship Coordinator. Participating agencies maintain
the right to determine the number of interns and the length of participation
they will allow for each intern assigned to them. Therefore, final decision
for an assignment to an agency will be determined by the Internship
Coordinator or Department Chair with special attention given to your indicated
preferences.

**University Registration for Internship**

Students must register in advance for LEJA 490, Internship, and LEJA 491,
Internship Summary, following normal University registration procedures.
Failure to register for internship before the start date will result in the
cancellation of the internship. LEJA 490 is not a pass/fail course, but a
satisfactory/unsatisfactory grading system is used. LEJA 491 is graded A, B,
C, D, or F. In addition, those students who are planning to enroll on campus
for the next semester must pre-register. This is your responsibility not the
Internship Coordinator's, nor the Advisers'. Students can register for their
internship through STARS On-line, [STARS on the
Web](http://mvs.wiu.edu/stars.shtml), or via Tele STARS at (309) 298-5000.
When registering, students should also arrange to pay fees by mail.

Potential student interns must have a minimum 2.25 cumulative GPA and a
minimum 2.5 LEJA GPA when they attend their internship. Students who find that
either GPA has dropped below this level must notify the Adviser and Internship
Coordinator immediately, or they will not receive their preferred assignment
when they are again eligible.

Those students who will be last-semester seniors during their internship
should file for graduation and complete all clearance forms for graduation
before leaving campus. Graduation Applications are available through the
Registrar's Office or through your Adviser. Failure to do this could result in
a delayed graduation and release of final transcripts.

####  Course Description:

This course examines the historical context and roles of political parties and
interest groups in the U.S.  We will be concerned with how they shape (and
have shaped) the political process, how they represent their various
constituencies, and how they deal with political, economic, and social issues
facing the nation.  By studying political parties and interest groups, we gain
a better understanding of our present political condition, as well as the
socio-economic structure that undergirds the American political system.

The course is loosely divided into two sections.  First, we take a historical
look at the development of political parties and interest groups in the U.S.
In doing so, we touch upon contending theories of political participation,
representation, and responsibility.  Organizational and collective action
problems for political parties and interest groups are also addressed.  In the
second section, we look in detail at some contemporary issues facing political
parties and interest groups.

Our classes will be organized around the topics and readings found in the
schedule that follows.  I tend to lecture interactively, which means classes
will involve seminar-like discussions.  In order for this to be a successful
course, it is imperative that you do the assigned readings, give yourself time
to think about them, and prepare yourself to discuss them in class.  


####  Course Requirements:

Before every class period, you will be required to submit a "thought piece"
\-- a critical review of the readings.  The "thought pieces" are to be 2-3
pages, double-spaced, and are due in my office by 10:30am of the day on which
the readings are to be discussed.  You are encouraged to email your thought
pieces to me.  Turning your assignments in early allows me to consider your
thoughts on the readings, which in turn, helps to give me an idea of how to
structure our discussions.  Late thought pieces will not be accepted.  There
will be seventeen (17) thought pieces, each worth 3 points, for a total of 51
percentage points of your final grade.  
    


There is an in-class mid-term exam on October 12.  A research paper on state
political parties and interest groups (5-7 double-spaced pages) is due on
October 28.  A rough draft of the research paper is due on October 19.  A
group project related to the research paper is due the last day of class
(November 18), and we will have group presentations on October 16 and October
18.  Details on the paper and project will be provided in class.  There are
absolutely no exceptions to the due dates.

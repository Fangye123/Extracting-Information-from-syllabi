MODULE II - AGRARIANISM VS INDUSTRIALISM, OR THE OLD SOUTH VS THE NEW SOUTH

8 Country Music (Bob). Special Instructions for today.  
        1) You need to print this lecture and bring it to class. It is under 20 pages, depending on the font size you use, so it should not be too much. [Click here for Country Music Lecture](CountryMusic.htm).   
        2) You do NOT need to read the lecture before class because of how the class will be run. I will be playing music, showing a few overheads, making only a few verbal comments, and expecting you to read the lecture as you listen. The reason is that you can't listen to me talk and listen to the words of the music at the same time--and an important part of country music is the words.   
        3) But you do need to answer the following _homework question_ : Write a paragraph about why you like or dislike country music. Turn it in before class, just as usual.

### Course Requirements:

Two take home exams, a final exam and a research paper are the written
requirements for this course. Failure to complete any of the requirements will
be regarded as a failure to complete the course, and will therefore result in
a failing grade. In addition, there will be four map quizzes. In preparation
for the paper, each student will prepare a statement of his or her paper
topic, with projected bibliography. This statement will not be graded, but
failure to hand it in will result in a loss of seven points on the final
grade. Papers received in the week after the due date, 5 p.m. on March 20,
will be marked down up to one full grade. _Absolutely no papers will be
accepted after 5 p.m. on March 27._  
  
Exams must be turned in by the due date indicated on the weekly schedule, and
quizzes must be taken when scheduled. Make-ups will be scheduled only by prior
consent of the instructor, and only for compelling reasons (as determined by
the instructor). If a student, without gaining prior consent, is unable to
turn in an assignment or take a quiz because of sudden illness or some other
extraordinary event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I cannot
be reached directly or by phone, leave a message with the History Department.
A student's request for a make-up must be accompanied by a doctor's note or
other written documentation.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Exams:

The take-home exams will consist of essays. The final exam will be the only
exam taken in the classroom (at the time indicated on the final exam schedule)
and will consist of short answer identifications, and two essay questions, one
of which will be comprehensive (covering the entire course). The instructor
will be looking for an organized and analytical approach to the material
presented in lectures, the assigned readings, and the discussions. Taking
careful notes in class and on the readings, therefore, is strongly
recommended. In the essays, the instructor will also be looking for an ability
to combine the raw materials of the course -- text, lectures, documentary
sources, and discussions -- into pertinent and meaningful insights. The
instructor will also be evaluating your ability to communicate those insights.
Points will be taken off for run-on sentences, grammatical errors, spelling
errors, poor punctuation, illegible handwriting or any other problems that, in
the opinion of the instructor, affect comprehension of the student's work.
Strive above all for clarity.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Grading:

The exams, the final, and the paper are worth 90 points each. The four map
quizzes are worth ten points each, for a total of 40 points. Your final grade
for the written assignments will be determined by the total number of points
you gain out of a maximum of 400. I will then judge whether the level of your
class participation warrants either raising or lowering your final grade. I do
not grade on a curve. Attendance, and evidence of progress or lack thereof in
the course of the semester will be used to decide half grades and borderline
cases (which, experience shows, means most students). Serious attendance
problems or misconduct in class can result in a lowering of grade. The grading
scale is as follows:  
  
Score / Grade:  
388-400=A+  
372-387=A  
360-371=A-  
348-359=B+  
332-347=B  
320-331=B-  
308-319=C+  
292-307=C  
280-291=C-  
268-279=D+  
252-267=D  
240-251=D-  
Below 240=F

### Extra-Credit Assignments:

Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the instructor. These
assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor on or before
February 27, and will not be accepted unless so approved. They are worth a
maximum of 40 points. Under no circumstances will an extra-credit assignment
be accepted as substitute for any other written requirement in the course. An
extra-credit assignment can only elevate a student into a higher grade bracket
(for example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored the higher grade on
at least one of the three major exams or on the paper. The assignment must
take the form either of an analytical book review (not a book summary) 3-5
pages in length, or a second documented paper 5-7 pages in length, and must
utilize sources not assigned in this course. The topic and sources must be
substantially different from the required research paper. Style of text,
footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to the guidelines of the
departmental style sheet. If you decide to do an extra-credit assignment, it
must be turned in no later than March 27 for you to receive credit.

### Attendance Policy:

Class attendance is a requirement of this course. Repeated unexcused absences
will lead to a reduction of grade. Unexcused absences totaling 25% or more
will result in an automatic F for the course. The instructor will excuse a
student only under the most extraordinary circumstances. Chronic lateness will
also be penalized, since it presents a class disturbance. If a student arrives
after roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to place his or her
name on the class roll no later than the end of that class period. Failure to
do so will result in an unexcused absence.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Class Participation:

Class participation is an essential part of this course. In most weeks, the
last class period will be set aside for discussion of the readings. Students
must arrive prepared to discuss the weekly assignments. In order to ensure
this, I will designate at the beginning of each discussion class two or more
students who will be graded for their contributions to the discussion that
day. Any students so chosen who have not read the material or who are absent
without prior clearance from me will receive a failing grade for that day's
discussion. I will rotate the selections so that everyone gets a more or less
equal chance to be "on call". Voluntary contributions from students not
designated by this system will of course be considered positively, especially
when they demonstrate acquaintance and engagement with the reading. Your
overall grade for class participation will not be figured numerically into
your final score, but will be an independent factor weighing heavily
nonetheless. It will be used to decide borderline cases, offset negative
trends like absences, or, if judged to be of significantly higher or lower
quality than your written work, possibly bump you to a higher or lower grade.
If I judge this system to be producing inadequate results, I reserve the right
to require other written or oral assignments to facilitate discussion, and to
use these assignments in the determination of final grades.  
  
I have set aside one week to focus on a particular issue, in this case, the
establishment of the state of Israel in Palestine and its consequences. This
will be a student driven exercise, combining assigned reading for all students
with specialized research topics assigned by me to individual students. During
this week, the class will collectively construct a timeline of the major
events, and each student researcher will contribute from what he or she has
learned to a discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One section of
the second take-home exam will be devoted exclusively to the issues covered
during this week.

### Honor Code and Plagiarism:

Students are expected to observe the honor code. All work for this course must
be pledged. Students found to have cheated on an exam or to have plagiarized
material in a paper will be subject to the maximum penalty under college
rules. For those in doubt about the definition of plagiarism, it consists of
copying passages from a source without both attribution **and** quotation. If
you have reproduced the language of your source, you have committed plagiarism
whether or not you have cited the source and the page number. This includes
passages that a student may have modified: for example, changed verb tenses,
omission or replacement of occasional words, reshuffling of phrases, sentences
or paragraphs, combining of different plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper
in your own words is far better than writing a good one using the words of
someone else. One suggestion for avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts
and sources: close all books when writing, and consult them only for specific
facts or direct quotes. Also, proofread your paper with plagiarism
specifically in mind. For more on plagiarism, see the departmental style
sheet.

### Taperecording and Class Decorum:

Taperecording of lectures is not permitted. Students who are excused from
class by the instructor must make arrangements with the instructor or with
other students to cover the material missed. Students who skip class without
permission are responsible for making their own arrangements with other
students (not with the instructor) for the material covered in class.  
  
Students are expected to observe class decorum. Students engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent. By order of the department chair, food and drinks
are not permitted in the classroom.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Research Paper:

The research paper is designed specifically to show that the student can
research a topic and develop an analytical argument using source materials.
The emphasis should be as much as possible on _using primary source materials
from the period in question_. The use of documents from the assigned
sourcebook is a requirement. All students should meet with the instructor
about their paper topics, and do so as early as possible in the semester. Each
student will prepare a one-page written statement of his or her paper topic,
complete with bibliography, by the end of week three. These will then be
distributed to other students in the class, each of whom will prepare a
written critique due in the middle of week five.  
  
Neither of these assignments will be graded, but failure to complete either
assignment will result in a deduction of seven points from the final grade.
The final papers _must be printed on a word-processor_ , in a standard ten-
pitch font (courier 10 is preferred), with double-spaced text, a title page,
and one-inch (and no more than one-inch) margins. The text (not including
bibliography, title page and endnotes page) should be no less than 5 _**full
pages**_ and no more than 7 pages in length. This means that, if you use
footnotes (i.e., at the bottom of each page), the text must be _longer_ than
five full pages to compensate for the formatting of the notes. Your name, the
course name and number, section number and the date must be on the title page.  
  
It must include a bibliography of all sources cited. Bibliography and footnote
or endnote citations must conform to the proper style, as defined in the
"Department of History and Political Science Style Sheet" on sale in the
bookstore. More in-depth coverage of style questions can be found in the
latest edition of Kate Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses
and Dissertations_. **Do not use MLA, APA, parenthetical footnotes or any
alternative style current in other disciplines. Unless you wish to see the
instructor fly into a blind rage, make a particular point of not using
parenthetical notes**. All papers should be saved to disk in at least two
separate locations (hard disk and floppy, two floppies, etc.), so that a new
copy may be immediately printed in case the original hard copy is misplaced.  
  
The type of material that must be documented (i.e. footnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge, statistics, all quotes, and paraphrases or
summaries of an author's argument. All direct quotes over fifty words in
length must be indented and single-spaced as described in the departmental
style sheet. You should have at least one footnote per full page of text.  
  
It is imperative that you document source material, but the _argument or
thesis of your paper must be in your own words_ : excessive use of quotes or
lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads easily to the
grievous sin of plagiarism. On plagiarism, see above. The citation of at least
three different sources is a _minimal_ requirement for the paper. In addition
to the assigned texts, which you are required to use, you must utilize at
least one other source from the library. This source must be a scholarly study
of article or book length, or another set of primary documents beyond those
found in Beatty and Johnson. You may use encyclopedias and other reference
works for background information only: these should not be cited as sources,
and will in no way be considered a replacement for a more substantial outside
source. Double-dipping (submitting a paper for this course that is
substantially the same as a paper submitted for any other course, past or
present) is not permitted  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### CORRECT FORM FOR TERM PAPERS

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT use parenthetical notes!! Only footnotes and endnotes will be
acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.  
  
Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.  
  
The following are some useful examples from Turabian:  
  
Footnoting a book:  
  
    **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  
  
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,  
  
    **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)  
  
If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,  
  
    **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**  
  
Footnoting an article or selection in an edited anthology or book of readings:  
  
    **3 Klemens von Metternich, "Political Confession of Faith," in Brian Tierney and Joan Scott, eds., _Western Societies: A Documentary History_ , 2 vols. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984), 2: 239.**  
( _Note that in the above example, the number of volumes in the book appears
after the title and the specific volume from which the citation came appears
before the page number at the end._ )  
  
If a different article or selection is cited from the same anthology, students
should use the following form:  
  
    **9 Thomas Malthus, "First Essay on Population," in Tierney and Scott, eds., _Western Societies_ , 2: 144.**  
  
  
Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
  
    **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**  
  
Footnoting a Review:  
  
    **4 Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in _American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November l985): 726-29.**  
  
Footnoting a Journal:  
  
    **8 Don Swanson, "Dialogue with a Catalogue," _Library Quarterly_ 34 (December l963): ll3-25.**  
  
Electronic Documents (ONLY IF APPROVED BY INSTRUCTOR IN ADVANCE)

Footnoting a Magazine;  
  
    **9 Anne B. Fisher, "Ford Is Back on the Track," _Fortune_ , 23 December l985, l8.**

     **10 Michael Norman, "The Once-Simple Folk Tale Analyzed by Academe," _New York Times_ , 5 March l984, p. l5**  
  
Bibliography: Your bibliography should be entitled "Works Cited," and it
should only include works which you have cited in your footnotes/endnotes.

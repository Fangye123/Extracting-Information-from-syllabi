**Catalog Description**  
---  
  
This course provides an introduction to the history of our neighbors to the
south, a history very different from our own.  After a discussion of the
geography and climate of the region, the course will focus on precolumbian
societies of the Americas, the period of European exploration and contact, the
Spanish conquest of Mexico and Peru, the development of colonial societies,
the struggle for independence, and the emergence of the modern nations of
Latin America and their place in the world economic system.

**Course Objectives**  
---  
  
1\. To describe and analyze broad trends in Latin American history  
    Example:  What was the long-term impact of Spanish colonial rule on Latin America? 

2\. To critique historical sources  
    Example:  How should one interpret information from interviews with indigenous women from the Mexican state of Chiapas in 1994? 

3\. To critique historical arguments  
    Example:  How do modernization and dependency theories shape much of the scholarship on Latin America since WWII? 

4\. To compare developments between various nations and regions of the
Americas  
    Example:  How did the United States become one of the wealthiest and most powerful nations in the world, while Mexico and the rest of  Latin  America continue to struggle both economically and politically? 

5\. To debate specific issues of historical importance  
    Example: Was the Mexican Revolution really a revolution?

**Grading**  
---  
  
Final grades will be based on a total of 400 points: 3 exams worth 100 points
each; a map quiz worth 25 points; and 15 in-class writing assignments (one-
minute papers) worth 5 points each for a total of 75 points.  Exams, taken in
class, will require each student to respond to several short-answer
identifications and one essay question.  The final exam will not be
comprehensive.  Grades will not be curved.  Make-up exams _must_ be arranged
in advance of the regularly-scheduled exam and will _never_ be given before
the regularly-scheduled exam.   In order to schedule a make-up exam, a student
must present a written excuse from either the Student Health Service or from a
family physician.

**Advice for Success**  
---  
  
1\. Attendance is required.  If you have another course or University activity
that will conflict with regular attendance, do not take this course.  Because
the 15 in-class writing assignments comprise 75 points of your final grade, it
is imperative that you come to class regularly.  Because these writing
assignments are keyed to class discussion, it will not be possible to make up
any missed papers.

2\. The policies published in _Academic Honesty and Dishonesty_ apply to this
course.   You will receive a copy in class.

3\. Come to class prepared to discuss the readings assigned for that week.

4\. Ask questions.

5\. Review sessions will be offered before each exam.  Plan to attend.

6\. Ask more questions.

7\. Please submit three blank blue books (large size) by Tuesday, Sept 7.
Write your name on the back, not in the box for names.

IF YOU ARE IN DOUBT REGARDING COURSE POLICIES, PLEASE CONSULT WITH PROFESSOR
AUSTIN ALCHON BEFORE YOU COMPLETE ANY PART OF THIS COURSE.

**Policy on Student Class Attendance**  
---  
 Historically, students who attend class regularly do well.  Students who do
not attend on a regular basis, usually do poorly.   This is especially
important because the 15 in-class writing assignments comprise 75 points of
your final grade; and because they are keyed to class discussions,  they can
not be made up.  Therefore, attendance is required.

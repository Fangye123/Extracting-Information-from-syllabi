>   1. Course Description:

>

> A course in mathematics content, methods and materials for elementary
education majors. Specific teaching methods and materials are considered.
Practice with teaching aids/manipulatives is included. Content learning and
methodology will be emphasized which is developmentally and sequentially
appropriate to grades K-6. MAT 111 is a prerequisite for EDU 106; this course
is taken during the Junior Professional Year. These methods are relative to
the NCTM standards which are based on current learning theory and the
developmental stages of children. Field experience provided. Emphasis is
placed on the Indiana Wesleyan University Teacher Education Knowledge Base
Model: "The Teacher as the Decision Maker". It is expected that student will
understand their role in becoming a world changer.

measurement, computation, and problem solving. (I, V)

>     8. Various kinds of calculators and computers (I, V)

>     9. Significant historical and cultural mathematical developments. (I, V)

>

> This course provides opportunities to demonstrate:  
>

>     1. The identification and modeling of the various teaching strategies
used in problem solving in the primary grades.

>     2. The use of a variety of concrete manipulative materials for
development and exploration of:

>       1. pre-numeration concepts

>       2. numbers(whole numbers, fractions, decimals, percents, irrational
numbers) and their relationship

>       3. four basic operations with positive and negative rational numbers

>       4. geometric concepts

materials documenting the student's competency in the utilization of best
current practices in teaching. (Appendix I) Topics to be assigned.

>       2. Mathematics Philosophy Statement - The development of a written
statement of your philosophy of mathematics education is important proof of
your growing knowledge as a pre-service teachers. You should be able to
incorporate your knowledge of mathematics theories, professional standards,
and processes and practices into a concise written form which clearly states
the ways you will teach mathematics to elementary students. Your philosophy
should be double spaced and no more than two pages long using 12 point type.
(Appendix 5)

>       1. Class Presentation/Assessment - The student will demonstrate
mastery of content, methods and strategies of teaching elementary mathematics
by individual demonstration of these skills in a classroom setting. (Appendix
3)

>       2. Exams - Two exams will be given; a mid-term and a final. Quizzes
and examinations will cover content, methods and strategies of teaching
elementary mathematics gained from the text, videos, class work and
presentations.

>

>   5. Policies:

>

> Successful completion of course work is based upon the following:
Professional quality of work - completeness, neatness, promptness

>     1. Regular attendance and participation in in-class activities.

>     2. The standard for Indiana Wesleyan Teacher Education Program is " a
professional education course completed with less than a 2.0 (C) must be
repeated."

>     3. All assignments are due on the date indicated in this syllabus and on
the class schedule. All assignments are due at the beginning of the class
period. They should be handed to the instructor. Any assignment submitted late
will be lowered by FIVE points for each day late.

>     4. Attendance at every class is expected. Since class participation is
an integral part of the learning process in this course, for each unexcused
absence the student's grade will be lowered 2 points. Excused absences are
submitted from the Dean's office. Written notification of excused absences
must also be submitted prior to the absence by the student to the instructor.

>     5. Three tardies (5 min. or more) equal one unexcused absence.

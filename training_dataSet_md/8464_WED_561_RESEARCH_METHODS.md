_Purpose of the Course_

* * *

     "Research Methods" is a required course for all students pursuing the Master of Science in Education degree with a major in Workforce Education and Development. The overall purpose of the course is to introduce basic vocabulary, concepts, and methods of educational research. Students learn the language of research, various methods for conducting research, how to identify and synthesize research literature, how to plan a research study that improves the practice of education or training, and how to formally report research findings. The more specific purpose is for students to develop a sample research proposal. 

Many students have misunderstandings about the nature of WED 561, one result
of which is taking the course in the last semester of their graduate program.
Then, if the paper isn't finished during the semester, students may have to
register for an additional semester.

Students are encouraged to take the course during the first half of their
graduate program. One is not expected to have a research problem identified
before taking the course. Rather, part of the course instruction is designed
to assist students in the systematic identification of a research topic.
Students should also be aware that the development of a research problem and
proposal and the evolution of a research study is best conducted over a period
of several semesters rather than being concentrated in a final, hectic
semester.

_General Objectives_

* * *

    

  1. Understands basic concepts and definitions of educational research. 
  2. Selects a tentative research problem that will be subsequently developed into a research proposal. 
  3. Knows and uses library reference sources and services. 
  4. Understands how to develop Chapter One of the research paper/proposal. 
  5. Understands how to develop Chapter Two of the research paper/proposal 
  6. Understands how to develop Chapter Three of the research paper/proposal. 
  7. Knows APA rules and guidelines related to writing formal research reports. 
  8. Understands how to develop Chapter Four of the research paper/proposal. 
  9. Understands how to develop Chapter Five of the research paper/proposal. 

_Instructional Units_

* * *

     Each general objective provides the focus for an instructional unit containing multiple specific objectives and assignments designed to facilitate the objectives. Beginning with Unit Four, in-class instruction is directed toward the application of relevant concepts to the preparation of a sample research proposal. 

One cannot expect to master the subject of educational research in a single
semester. And, the schedule format (evening, weekend, or summer) and number of
students enrolled affects what can be accomplished in a given course. Students
can anticipate completing the first seven units during the course. Units Eight
and Nine, however, are optional (*) and will be instructed to the extent that
time permits. Most students should expect to enroll in WED 593 (or 599) and
work with their program committee to actually conduct and report the research
(i.e., the focus of Units Eight and Nine).

New WED Department policies require students to purchase instructional units.
The instructor will provide details regarding cost and availability.

  * Unit One: Concepts and Definitions
  * Unit Two: The Academic Research Problem
  * Unit Three: Tools for Knowing
  * Unit Four: Chapter One - Introduction
  * Unit Five: Chapter Two - Review of Literature and Research
  * Unit Six: Chapter Three - Research Methods
  * Unit Seven: APA Editorial Guidelines
  * Unit Eight: Chapter Four - Analysis and Results*
  * Unit Nine: Chapter Five - Summary and Conclusions*

_Assignments and Requirements_

* * *

    

  1. Complete instructional units and related exercises as directed. Come to class prepared. Actively participate in discussion of relevant topics. 
  2. Complete hands-on "library use exercise" (Unit Three) as directed. Assignment due on ____________________. 
  3. Prepare a three chapter research proposal in accordance with outline provided in Unit Two (approximately 15 typed pages). 
  4. A draft of Chapter One is due on ____________________. 
  5. The completed proposal is due on ____________________. 
  6. Complete a final examination covering objectives, assignments, and class lectures for Units One through Six 

_Grading_

* * *

     A conventional letter grade (A - F) will be assigned based on the following criteria: 

  * 10% - Library exercise 
  * 40% - Final exam 
  * 50% - Research proposal 

The instructor will explain in class specific grading procedures and how final
grades are calculated. Test norms will be provided showing how previous WED
561 students performed.

_Policies and Standards_

* * *

     The majority of students complete assignments satisfactorily and on-time. Out of respect for the majority of students who meet deadlines, one letter grade is deducted for any work turned in late. Attendance is expected. It is recognized, however, that personal and professional needs and responsibilities may sometimes require students to miss a class. Preceding or following an absence, students should contact the instructor to obtain handout materials. Students should also make arrangements with a classmate to obtain notes. A third absence results in one letter grade deduction. A fourth absence results in failure of the course. An INC grade is not a student option; it is given only at the discretion of the instructor. 

Informal attire is permitted, but please dress in a manner appropriate for a
university classroom, including removing hats or caps. Coffee and other drinks
may be consumed during class, but no food is to be eaten in the classroom.

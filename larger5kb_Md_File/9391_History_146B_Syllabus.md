_Course description:_ This course will focus on nation state building,
modernization, and political-religious movements in the post-World War I
Middle East. Most of the states emerged from the territories of the Ottoman
Empire at the end of World War I. All sought to build develop stable political
structures and institutions, develop their economics, and advance their
cultural and religious heritages while withstanding often overwhelming outside
interference. This course provides a comparative introduction to modern Middle
Eastern history and will focus on key developments in Turkey, Iran, Egypt,
Israel and the occupied territories, Syria, Iraq, and Saudi Arabia. Among the
major themes will be the impact of oil, the development of political Islamic
movements, changing gender relations, and the development of civil society.

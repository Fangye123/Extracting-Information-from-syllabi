**History 342**

**MODERN CHINESE HISTORY**

(Spring, 2002)

REVISED SYLLABUS

Professor: Richard J. Smith

Office: Humanities Building, Room 322

Phone: 713-348-2552; fax: 713-348-5207; e-mail address: smithrj@rice.edu

Office Hours: Tuesdays, 2:30 p.m.-4:00 p.m, Wednesdays, 1:00-2:00 p.m.,
Thursdays, 2:30 p.m.-4:30 p.m., and by appointment

_Time_ : TuTh, 1:00 -2:20 p.m.

_Place_ : Humanities Building, Room 328

_Course Description_ : This course deals with the rise of modern China, from
the late Qing (Ch'ing) dynasty (1644-1912) to the People's Republic
(1949-present). It has not been an easy ascent. Over the past century, China
has endured extraordinary hardships--the inroads of Western imperialism,
massive rebellion, revolution, the curse of warlordism, invasion by Japan, a
devastating civil war, and radical reconstruction under the Chinese
Communists. In the midst of it all, Chinese intellectuals have searched
persistently for answers to China's pressing problems. We will be concerned in
this course with the nature of their quest and the answers it produced.

_Requirements_ : This course involves (A) a quiz (worth approximately 10%) on
February 14; (B) a midterm (worth approximately 25%) on March 14; (C) a short
(c. 10 pp.) paper (worth approximately 25%), due in class on April 2; and (C)
a three-hour self-scheduled final or a 15-page final paper, due no later than
the last day of finals (worth approximately 40%). **Your paper(s) must be
typewritten, double-spaced, or stapled, and paginated; no folders or fancy
fonts; no e-mail versions or faxes. If you plagiarize any part of any
assignment you will fail the course, and this will be the least of your
troubles. Trust me.** Late papers and exams will be penalized one-third of a
grade (e.g. l- to 2+) per day out of fairness to the rest of the class. The
only valid excuse for an extension will be a medical one. I plan to be
extremely hard-nosed about this. Class attendance and participation will be
considered in borderline cases, and students who do not have an e-mail account
and access to the world-wide web will be seriously disadvantaged in terms of
certain course materials. **Students taking this course pass/fail must earn
passing grades on all assignments and exams in order to pass**. For a
statement on University policy toward physical disability, see the end of this
syllabus.

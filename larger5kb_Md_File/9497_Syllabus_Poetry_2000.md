**SYLLABUS**  
Persian Poetry (in Translation)  
**CAS 3/5602; MELC 3/5602**

Conceptual Frame:

This course deals with court poetry, Sufic poetry, and the poetry of the
people or "new poetry." Court poets and Sufic poets use Arabic-based meters,
rhyme, and symbolism to express their sentiments while the new poet involves
his audience in the solution of social, political, and ideological problems of
his day. The course contrasts these attitudes in the context of Iran's growth
from a medieval kingdom to a modern nation.

Objectives:

  * Acquaint students with cultures other than their own.   

  * Show students that poetry, irrespective of the language in which it is composed, carries a universal message.   

  * Allow students to view the West and the US through the eyes of the peoples from other cultures.   

  * Teach students how different cultures have express their values through their art   

  * Allow students to observe how a single couplet carries large amounts of information

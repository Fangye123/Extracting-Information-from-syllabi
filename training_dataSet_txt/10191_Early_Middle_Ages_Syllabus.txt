HISTORY 5360: THE EARLY MIDDLE AGES



This course examines the history of the early middle ages, chronologically from about A.D. 300 to
900.  Major themes and topics will include: the later Roman empire, the establishment of the
barbarian kingdoms, the growth of the Christian church, and the emergence of the Carolingian
empire.  While a considerable amount of lecture time will be devoted to political history, the
course focuses primarily on the social, economic and cultural aspects of early medieval life.

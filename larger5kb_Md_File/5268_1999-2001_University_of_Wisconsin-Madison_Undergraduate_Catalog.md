The UW-Madison School of Business undergraduate program is frequently rated
among the top 10 business schools nationally. The school's undergraduate and
graduate programs were reaccredited in 1990 by the American Assembly of
Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB), the standard-setting organization for
collegiate business education. Upon graduation, School of Business students
automatically become members of Wisconsin Business Alumni, a network of more
than 27,000 alumni around the world. Many of the school's alumni have achieved
remarkable success in the business, service, government, and academic arenas
worldwide.

###  
History and Philosophy

Return to Top

In 1900, UW-Madison established one of the first six commerce programs in the
country, beginning as a department in the College of Letters and Science, and
receiving separate school status by a 1944 act of the Wisconsin Legislature.
The School of Business was a founding member of the American Assembly of
Collegiate Schools of Business (AACSB); Beta Gamma Sigma, a national
professional business honor society; and the Consortium for Graduate Study in
Management, a national equal opportunities program. A number of its programs
were also pioneers in their fields.

The School of Business is dedicated to providing the professional business
education needed to compete successfully in the evolving global environment.
Its rigorous degree programs aim to foster development of analytical,
communication, leadership, problem-solving, and decision making skills.
Generally, it combines a strong business foundation with exposure to a variety
of advanced analytical methods, social and technological system perspectives,
and varied classroom experiences.

###  
The Learning Environment

Return to Top

After undergraduate students complete their freshman and sophomore years in
the College of Letters and Science and are accepted into the School of
Business as juniors, they may select from 11 different majors and several
specializations while working toward the Bachelor of Business Administration
(BBA) degree.

Classes are taught in a variety of ways--cases, lectures, seminars, group
study projects, simulations, or by hands-on experience. Honors programs and a
variety of international study opportunities are available to undergraduate
business students.

To support student class work and research, the school has several
instructional computer labs, its own research computer, a minicomputer
network, and access to a number of business databases. Its specialized
Business Library serves both undergraduate and graduate students. The school
offers a variety of undergraduate scholarships as well as career services and
study help to students.

In 1993 the School of Business moved into newly built Grainger Hall, a state-
of-the-art facility that greatly expanded student, faculty, and instructional
areas.

###  
Students

Return to Top

In fall 1998, the School of Business had over 1,900 students--1,403 juniors
and seniors and 537 graduate students. Enrollments have been capped at the
undergraduate level to ensure quality in the face of heavy demand for business
school degrees.

###  
Business Student Organizations

Return to Top

Business students will find many organizations open to them. Student members
and their elected officers are responsible for the operations and the planning
of activities for each organization. The school's faculty actively supports
these organizations by acting as advisers or sponsors, attending as active or
honorary members, and serving as speakers or program chairs.

Undergraduate business student groups that are currently active include:

ABEA (Asian Business and Engineering Association)  
Actuarial Club  
AIESEC (International Association of Students in Economics and Business
Management)  
AISP (Association of Information Systems Professionals)  
Alpha Kappa Psi  
APICS (American Production and Inventory Control Society)  
Beta Alpha Psi  
Beta Gamma Sigma  
The Entrepreneur Club  
Financial Management Association  
MEBSS (Multi-Ethnic Business Student Society)  
Mu Kappa Tau  
Phi Chi Theta (national fraternity for men and women in business and
economics)  
Real Estate Club  
Risk Management and Insurance Society SHRM (Society for Human Resource
Management)  
SIGMA Iota Epsilon  
Student Faculty Board  
SQS (Student Quality Society)  
Toastmasters Club  

###  
Business Career Center

Return to Top

The School of Business maintains its own career center to help students
achieve their career goals. The Business Career Center (BCC) is known for the
strength of its career development and placement assistance.

Each year more than 500 regional, national, and international employers come
to the school to interview students seeking intern and full-time employment.
In addition, more than 8,000 current job openings are posted on line each
year.

Each fall the BCC sponsors Business Career Awareness Month which includes the
annual Career Forum attended by over 400 corporate representatives from more
than 150 organizations. In addition to mock interviews, over 50 seminars are
offered which focus on career opportunities and the development of effective
job search skills.

The BCC takes advantage of new technology and is able to offer employers two-
way interactive interviews using state-of-the-art videoconferencing equipment.

The BCC's Career Resource Room provides information on potential employers,
career opportunities, and employment projections. Placement information and
salary data from previous graduating classes are also available in the BCC,
3290 Grainger Hall, or at resume.bus.wisc.edu; 608/262-2550,
bccenter@bus.wisc.edu.

###  
Admissions

Return to Top

####  Business School Application Deadlines

**For admission to the junior-senior business program,** applications for the
spring semester must be filed by September 15 (for students on campus) or by
November 1 (for students off campus). Those who wish to enter the business
program in the fall semester must apply by February 1 (for students on campus)
or March 1 (for students off campus).

####  Prebusiness Classification for On-Campus Students

Students who hope to major in business as juniors and seniors spend their
first two years in the College of Letters and Science. They may indicate their
intentions for a business major on their admissions application. **In the
second semester of the freshman year, students should file a request for a
classification change to PRB 2 at the College of Letters and Science, 104
South Hall.** Currently, a classification change requires a 2.90 or higher
cumulative grade-point average at the end of the freshman year.

####  Transfer Students

**Sophomore transfer students who intend to enter the School of Business in
their junior year should apply to the university's Office of Undergraduate
Admissions (Armory and Gymnasium, 716 Langdon Street, Madison, WI 53706-1481)
by November 1 for spring semester and March 1 for fall semester.**

Students who complete the freshmen and sophomore years in colleges other than
UW-Madison should meet the prebusiness requirements, if graduation from the
School of Business is planned within the usual four-year period. To be
considered for admission to the School of Business, transfer students are
typically required by the Admission Committee to complete one full-time
semester in residence at UW-Madison (12-18 credits), which must include a
minimum of 6 credits of either business courses or unfulfilled starred (*)
courses--in effect for transfers summer 1999 or thereafter.

Business courses taken elsewhere are strictly evaluated for equivalency to UW-
Madison business courses. If a course has not been previously evaluated for
transfer, a syllabus must be presented, or only elective credit may be given.
Since courses in business at UW-Madison are taught primarily in the junior and
senior years and presuppose considerable college background, business courses
taught elsewhere to freshmen or sophomores are usually not acceptable for
satisfying course requirements in such fields as accounting, management,
marketing, finance, and business law.

Inquiries as to the transferability of business courses should be addressed to
the School of Business Undergraduate Office, 2265 Grainger Hall, 975
University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706.

###  
Honors Program

Return to Top

Students are eligible to participate in the business honors program upon
admission to the School of Business if they present a 3.5 grade-point average
and are approved by the Honors Committee. Interested students apply to the
honors program at the same time they apply for admission to the School of
Business. If admitted to the business honors program a student is eligible for
a BBA degree with honors if the overall grade-point average at the time of
graduation is 3.5 or higher.

To receive a BBA Honors Degree, a student must complete a minimum of 18 honors
credits in business and economics during their junior and senior years. In
addition, successful completion of a senior thesis under faculty supervision
is required. Honors candidates must take a minimum of 3 honors credits each
semester. Failure to do so will result in automatic withdrawal from the honors
program.

Interested students should contact the School of Business Undergraduate
Office, 2265 Grainger Hall, for referral to the School of Business Honors
Adviser.

###  
Business Scholars Program

Return to Top

The Business Scholars Program is an honors program available to outstanding
Wisconsin high school students. Admission is competitive and is based on high
school class standing and scores on the ACT/SAT. For more information, contact
the Undergraduate Office, 2265 Grainger Hall.

###  
Dean's List

Return to Top

BUS 3 and BUS 4 students who achieve a grade-point average in the upper 10
percent of their class for any semester in which they complete at least 12
graded degree credits will have their names on the dean's list. A permanent
record of this achievement is entered on the student's transcript. Students
with I, P, or Unreported on their grade report will automatically be
ineligible for the dean's list; subsequent academic action may change
eligibility.  
  
|

#### Change in Criterion

Effective fall 1999, Bus 3 and Bus 4 students who achieve a grade-point
average of 3.75 for any semester in which they complete 12 graded degree
credits will have their names on the dean's list.

(online update 7/99)

###  
Business Scholarships

Return to Top

The School of Business offers a number of undergraduate scholarships to junior
and senior students. In 1997-98, the school awarded 150 scholarships for a
total of $178,775. Application for awards toward undergraduate study can be
picked up at the start of the spring term and returned no later than February
15 to 2265 Grainger Hall. Awards are for the following academic year.
Scholarship awards vary from $200 to $3,000.

##  
Freshman-Sophomore Program

The Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) degree program is based on a
broad educational foundation combined with courses in business and economics.
This curriculum is designed for those students who wish to prepare for careers
in business or for other professions such as law.

A student planning to earn a Bachelor of Business Administration degree
enrolls for freshman and sophomore years in the College of Letters and
Science. It is imperative for sophomores to have the prebusiness (PRB)
classification to register for business courses.

Application to the business major is not automatic. Successful completion of
the prebusiness program does not guarantee admission to the Junior-Senior
Business program. Application must be made in competition with other
applicants (see Admissions Policy in the section on Junior-Senior Program).

###  
Advising

A prebusiness student enrolled in the College of Letters and Science may use
the School of Business Undergraduate Office for advising services. **The final
responsibility for selecting courses and meeting graduation requirements rests
with the student.** The prebusiness student need not secure advisers'
signatures to complete touchtone registration. Advisers merely assist in
selecting subjects for a broad education and help interpret the requirements
for orderly progress toward the degree.

Students with questions concerning requirements may contact the School of
Business Undergraduate Office, 2265 Grainger Hall, 975 University Avenue,
Madison, WI 53706.

###  
School of Business Learning Center

The Learning Center is an academic support resource available to students
enrolled in prebusiness and business courses. The Learning Center's primary
focus is to assist minority students, but it is open to all students taking
business or business-related courses--for example, ACCT I S 100, ACCT I S 211,
FINANCE 300, GEN BUS 303, GEN BUS 304, and Econ 101 and 102. Students should
inquire each semester about other courses supported. Students enrolled in the
Center meet twice weekly in small study groups as well as one-on-one with
trained Learning Center staff members during office hours. The program is
designed to reinforce lectures, text materials, and discussion sections.
Students interested in the Learning Center may call 608/262-1186 for more
information, or stop by the Learning Center Office, 2240 Grainger Hall. Please

General Requirements and Regulations  

###  
Admission Policy

Freshman and sophomore students are enrolled in a prebusiness curriculum in
the College of Letters and Science. Students should apply to the School of
Business at the beginning of the semester in which they will complete 54 or
more credits. To be considered for fall semester, a student must have filed an
application for admission by February 1 (on campus) or March 1 (off campus).
To be considered for admission for spring semester, a student must have filed
an application for admission by September 15 (on campus) or November 1 (off
campus).

Students who wish to retain the PRB classification as juniors or seniors must
apply to the School of Business (same deadline as those applying for admission
to the School of Business). The PRB 3/4 classification is limited to students
who have one or more starred (*) courses outstanding and have a cumulative
grade-point average on all courses and on all starred (*) courses at a level
consistent with admission as Business 3.

Those students will be admitted who demonstrate the greatest likelihood of
academic success, but the admissions process also ensures diversity of the
student body. In order to be considered for admission by the end of the
semester of application, a student must reach at least junior standing and
have completed all of the starred (*) prebusiness required courses.

Because of enrollment limitations, not all students meeting these criteria
will be admitted. Each December the School of Business faculty announces a UW-
Madison grade-point average (minimum of 30 UW-Madison credits) that will
_guarantee_ admission to the school for the academic year beginning 32 months
later. **To guarantee admission to the School of Business, students
matriculating college in summer 1999 or thereafter must earn for (1) all
courses taken AND (2) all starred (*) courses a cumulative GPA equal to or in
excess of the "guaranteed GPA for admission to the School of Business."
**Please see School of Business web page
wiscinfo.doit.wisc.edu/business/guaranteedGPA.htm for current GPA information.

Admission decisions will be based primarily on UW-Madison GPA. Other factors
that may be considered will be pattern and trend of grades, courses taken,
institutions attended, work or related experience, and factors beyond a
student's control that may have temporarily impaired academic performance.

An admissions committee composed of faculty members appointed by the dean of
the School of Business determines the admission of applicants.

The admissions committee will typically require transfer students to complete
one full-time semester in residence at UW-Madison (12-18 credits), which must
include a minimum of 6 credits of either business courses or unfulfilled
nonbusiness starred (*) courses. This is in effect for transfers summer 1999
or thereafter.

**The Bachelor of Business Administration degree is awarded only to students
who have been admitted to the School of Business.**

Students with questions on admission and adviser assignments should go to the
School of Business Undergraduate Office, 2265 Grainger Hall.

###  
Credits for BBA Degree

A total of not less than 120 credits is required for the Bachelor of Business
Administration degree. Among these 120 credits:

  * **52** credits must be in business and economics (includes all courses required and recommended for majors and specializations offered by the School of Business); 
  * **52** credits must be other than business and economics; 
  * **16** credits may be in or outside business-economics areas. 

These BBA degree credits must include the **prebusiness** requirements
outlined earlier, plus the business **foundation** courses, plus the courses
within a **major** area selected by the student from fields of study described
in the following sections, plus electives. The program of a first-semester
junior should include: **the first course in the major field, and ACCT I S
211. GEN BUS 300 should be taken in the junior year.**

###  
Business Foundation Requirements

All degree candidates in the School of Business are required to complete
certain foundation courses in business and economics. The foundation courses,
in conjunction with a broad educational base, are designed to integrate the
student's specialized training with an understanding of the structure and
functions of business and its role in the larger social system.

####  Core Courses Required of All Business Students:

GEN BUS 300 Professional Communication, 3  
GEN BUS 301 Business Law, 3  
GEN BUS 303 **or**  
ECON 310 **or**  
STAT 224 **or**  
STAT 301, 3-4 Statistics  
ACCT I S 211 Principles of Managerial Accounting, 3  
FINANCE 300 Introduction to Finance, 3  
MARKETNG 300 Marketing Management, 3  
M H R 300 Organizational Behavior, 3  
O I M 350 Management of Service and Manufacturing Operations, 3

####  Additional Breadth

Two courses in Business School departments outside the major department must
be taken to satisfy the breadth requirement. Courses taken to satisfy this
requirement may not include core courses, or courses required by, or cross
listed with, the student's major, or Gen Bus 100, or 399 (Reading Research).
Students cannot take both courses from the same department.

**Note:** Students with two majors in business need one course in another
business department outside their major to satisfy the breadth requirement;
students with three or more majors in business do not need a breadth course.

###  
General Requirements and Regulations

The student is expected to be familiar with university requirements and School
of Business regulations, some of which follow.

####  Attendance

Each student is expected to attend all assigned classes during the regular
meeting times, and to take all examinations for those courses at the regularly
scheduled times. In the case of excused absences the student is expected to
make up the work within a reasonable time.

####  Changes in Schedule

Changes in course schedule may be made without an adviser's approval. A course
may be added within the first two weeks of a semester; a course may be dropped
during the first nine weeks of a semester. Please check current timetable for
the last day to drop courses or withdraw from the University without courses
and grades of DR or W on transcript.

####  Computers

It is recommended that undergraduates admitted to the School of Business
possess the skills necessary to operate a personal computer, including a basic
knowledge of word processing, spreadsheets, and data management. Students are
encouraged to have their own personal computers.

####  Course Load

Undergraduates usually register for 15 to 18 credits per semester. A student
who has received a B average (3.0) or better in the preceding semester, on the
basis of at least 14 credits, may carry a program of not more than 20 credits
if the program does not include more than six courses. Students who need to
carry more than 18 credits per semester or more than 12 credits during summer
sessions must secure approval from 2265 Grainger Hall before touchtone
registration. Students will be assessed additional fees per credit for all
credits above 18.

####  Retroactive Language Credit

Credits granted for foreign language taken in high school will be in addition
to the 120 credits required for a Bachelor of Business Administration degree.
For more information on retroactive language credit, see the Admission section
in this catalog.

####  Courses That Do Not Count Toward a BBA Degree

No BBA degree credits will be given for Cnsr Sci 275 Consumer Finance, or Cnsr
Sci 665 Household Risk Management.

####  Academic Probation and Drop

Every student is expected to maintain a C average (2.0 GPA) in each semester
or summer session and at least a C average cumulative GPA for all business and
economics courses taken. Failure to meet either standard will result in
probationary status. A student will be cleared of probationary status at the
end of the semester or summer session when the following four conditions have
been met: (1) GPA for the term is at least 2.0; (2) cumulative GPA for all
business and economics courses is at least 2.0; (3) overall cumulative GPA is
at least 2.3; (4) the student's academic record contains no grade of
incomplete.

Students will be dropped from enrollment in the School of Business if they
continue on probationary status for two semesters, failing to achieve both a
2.0 GPA in each probationary semester and an overall cumulative 2.3 GPA at the
end of each probationary semester. Students whose GPA places them in dropped
status may reenroll on probationary status after a two-semester hiatus if they
can demonstrate the ability and desire to devote sufficient energy to
scholastic work. GPA deficiencies causing probationary status cannot be
removed through course work at another university or through correspondence
study.

####  Pass/Fail Privilege

A School of Business junior or senior with a 2.3 or better cumulative GPA and
who is not on probation may elect a total of 12 pass/fail credits during the
junior and senior years. The pass/fail grade will not be included when
computing GPA, but the pass/fail credits with S (satisfactory) grades will
apply toward graduation; S is the grade for A to C; U is the grade for D and
F.

This pass/fail privilege is for elective work. A student may **not** take the
following required courses on a pass/fail basis:

  * Any course within a major; any starred recommended elective; 
  * Any course which is a prerequisite to enter the School of Business; 
  * Any specific course required for graduation from the School of Business. 

No more than a total of two elective courses in business and economics may be
taken on a pass/fail basis.

The student must submit the pass/fail privilege form available in 2265
Grainger Hall to that office within the first four weeks of the semester in
which the pass/fail course is to be taken (for summer session, by the end of
the second week of the eight-week session). To change a course to pass/fail
the student has to use the touchtone system after submission of the form. Once
the student has submitted the form, the course **may not** be changed from
pass/fail back to a conventionally graded course; once a pass/fail grade is
recorded as S or U, it cannot be changed to a letter grade.

####  Physical Education/Dance/Kinesiology

Students are allowed a total of 8 degree credits of physical
education/dance/kinesiology toward a BBA degree.

####  Residency for Degree

Assuming all degree requirements can be satisfied, seniors who transfer to UW-
Madison from another campus must complete an additional 30 credits after
admission to the School of Business to satisfy the minimum residence
requirement for an undergraduate degree; 15 of those credits must be business
courses to be eligible for a BBA degree. Students admitted to the School of
Business from another program on campus must complete a minimum of 30 credits
as a business undergraduate major. Except for the international business
major, or unless special permission is granted by the chair of the major
department, students can use a maximum of two courses taken at another school
to satisfy requirements of the UW-Madison School of Business major that are
not part of the School of Business core. Individual departments may have a
more restrictive policy on transfer courses.

####  Withdrawal

A student who finds it necessary to withdraw during a semester or summer
session must call into the touchtone system and drop all their courses.
Failure to do so may result in a recording of Failure for all courses and a
"may not continue" action. Any student may withdraw with permission and
without grades being recorded at any time up to the last three weeks of a
semester or up to the last two weeks of a summer session.

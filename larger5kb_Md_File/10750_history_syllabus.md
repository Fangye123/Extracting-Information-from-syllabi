**_Description:_** The history of the media is the history of struggle. It is
a battle waged over words and images: who produces them, who has access to
them, and whose interests are served by them. Media power has traditionally
been the province of elites, from Church and State to multinational
communication conglomerates. But this is only one side of the story, for
everyday people have also fought for their right to speak and be spoken to.
Media has moved from the elite to the masses, in the process becoming
"democratized," but also often commodified. Beginning with the printed word,
and moving from the Bible through plays and popular song; pamphlets, penny
press and advertisements; film, radio and television, this course will use the
history of the mass media to explore enduring questions of power and culture.  
  
_**Requirements:**_ 1) Attendance, diligent reading, and active participation
in all class discussions,  "real" as well as virtual  
2) The choice of either three short essays--6-8 pages each--over the course of
the semester, or one short essay and one long one of 12-16 pages. All essays
must be typed and double spaced.  
Note1: I'm always open to suggestions on assignments. A video, poem, song,
performance, web page, etc. in place of some the written assignments is
possible and could be very exciting. Just talk to me first.

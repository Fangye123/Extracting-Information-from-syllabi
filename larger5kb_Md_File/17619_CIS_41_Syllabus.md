### Course Description

Fundamentals of computer graphics programming. Graphics hardware and software
standards. 2D geometric primitives and raster images. 3D object
representations. Data structures, algorithms, and the graphics pipeline.
Graphical user interfaces. Underlying concepts in computer graphics systems,
including games, animation, modeling, rendering, and paint systems.

Prerequisite: Computer and Information Science 11 and 22.

### Course Objectives

At the conclusion of this class, students should understand the underlying
principles of computer graphics. They should also be able to write 2D and3D
computer graphics applications using the C programming language with the
OpenGL graphics library.

### Textbooks

We will be using the following textbook for this course:

  * F.S. Hill, Jr., **Computer Graphics Using OpenGL** , 2nd Edition, Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 2001.

You might also want to have programming references for C and OpenGL. I
recommend the following:

  * Mason Woo et. al., **OpenGL Programming Guide** , 3rd Edition, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA, 1999.
  * Kernighan & Ritchie, **The C Programming Language** , Prentice Hall, 1998.

### Course Requirements

Your grade will be based on the following criteria:

  * ProgrammingAssignments - 40%  
All programming assignments involve writing C programs that make calls to the
OpenGL libraries. Most build on capabilities developed in earlier assignments.
You are expected to complete all homework assignments and hand them in on
time. You will be penalized for any late or missing assignments.

  * Homework Assignments - 10%  
You will also be given a series of written homework assignments. Their purpose
is to get you to think about the material being covered in class. They are
also excellent preparation for the exams.

  * Midterm Exam - 25%
  * Final Exam - 25%

The exams will test your understanding of computer graphics concepts and
issues. Both exams are closed book/notes, taken during class time. Cheating
will not be tolerated. If you are caught cheating on an exam, you will
automatically receive a 0 on it. If you miss an exam, you will have to make it
up with a grueling oral exam and provide a corroborating doctor's note.

### Computer Facilities

Programming assignments may be done on the Sun workstations in theAtrium
Computer Laboratory in the Plaza Building (1306). If you are registered for
this class, you have been assigned a unix account. Goto the computer
laboratory to activate your account. If you prefer,you can do the programming
assignments on your own PC using C andOpenGL. If you choose this option, you
are responsible for obtaining your own C development environment and the
OpenGL graphics library (see <http://www.opengl.org> for details).

### Advice

Think of me as your cranky client. There may be times when you disagree with
what I say. You may think that some things are a matter of opinion, or that
you are right and I am wrong. Just remember that I am the one giving out the
grades. When I make a suggestion, be sure to listen, because it may have an
impact on your final grade.

Start your assignments early. That way if you have trouble, you can get help
in time to finish your assignment by the due date. This will also help you to
avoid a last-minute crunch in the lab.

Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you don't understand something, it's
likely that your classmates don't understand it either. Raise questions in
class. If you need further explanation, come see me during office hours. If
you can't make my office hours, send me email. Be sure to do this before you
get hopelessly lost.

If you still find that you're having trouble completing an assignment on time,
hand in what you have on the due date. Be sure to adequately comment any code
to indicate what remains to be done, and what problems are being encountered.
You may be asked to resubmit the completed work at a later time.

Work with other students. I do not mean that you should copy each other's work
(which will not be tolerated). Rather, you should learn from one another. If
you can't figure out how to make something work, see how your colleague did
it. It is also useful to discuss different ways of approaching a problem.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you anticipate any problems with
this class. If alerted to them early on, I will make every effort to
accommodate your needs.

### Schedule

Please note that this schedule is approximate, and subject to change. Readings
are from **Computer Graphics** and represent the material covered in the class
that day. [Programming assignments](CGHW.html#programming) and [homework
assignments](CGHW.html#homework) are due on the days indicated.

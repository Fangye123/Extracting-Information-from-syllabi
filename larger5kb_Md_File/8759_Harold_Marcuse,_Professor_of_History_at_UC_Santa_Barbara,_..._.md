[![Casual portrait of Herbert Marcuse in his study in the

you logged on to find out, the leftist **philosopher Herbert Marcuse
(1898-1979)** was my grandfather.  
For more information about him, see:

  * a [short biography](http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/herbert.htm) I drafted for a presentation in 1997
  * the **[detailed Herbert Marcuse web page](http://www.marcuse.org/herbert/index.htm)** I made about him at the [**marcuse.org**](http://www.marcuse.org) **web site** , or
  * Doug Kellner's [critical theory website](http://www.uta.edu/huma/illuminations/) at the University of Texas, Austin.

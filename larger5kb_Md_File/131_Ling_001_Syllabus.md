    * Also on reserve at [Rosengarten](http://www.library.upenn.edu/services/reserves/res-vanpelt.html?vanpelt), in an edition with different page numbers from those indicated in the syllabus (but the chapter content is the same); call number P106.P476.
  * [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language](http://www.cup.org/ObjectBuilder/ObjectBuilder.iwx?ProcessName=ProductPage&Merchant_Id=1&product_id=0-521-55967-7&origin=search&searchField=TITLE&searchString=encyclopedia%20of%20language) (2nd edition), by David Crystal, Cambridge University Press, 1997.

Note that the edition used in this course is quite different from the 1st edition, so you won't be able to use an older copy of the book. 

**Requirements**  
---  
  
You are expected to do the assigned readings and regularly attend lectures,
since these are necessary for you to understand the material tested by written
work. There are three kinds of assignments that will be graded.

**Homework**

> There will be five homework assignments, handed out on Thursday and due the
following Tuesday at the beginning of the lecture. They give practice in
applying the principles studied in class and in analyzing particular
linguistic phenomena. They are graded on a scale of 0-10.

>

> Late assignments will not be accepted. Make-up assigments will be provided
only for students with proof of a medical or personal emergency.

**Quizzes**

> Two short quizzes will be given in lieu of a midterm exam. They will take
place on Thursday in weeks 3 and 5 (at the beginning of the meeting) and will
test knowledge of basic facts and concepts. They will take the form of
multiple-choice and short-answer questions requiring you to explain or
illustrate a particular concept in linguistics. See the [study
guide](study.html) for topics to be covered.

**Final**

> A comprehensive two-hour final exam will cover material from the entire
course, with a bit more emphasis on the last two weeks (since they were not
included in the quizzes). It will be given in the last class meeting,
Thursday, June 27. Like the quizzes, it will consist of multiple-choice and
short-answer questions.

**Grading**  
---  
  
The final grade for the course will be determined according to the following
percentages.

> Homework assignments | 40%  
> ---|---  
> Quizzes | 20%  
> Final exam | 40%  
  
Interim grades will be circulated by e-mail a few times during the term.

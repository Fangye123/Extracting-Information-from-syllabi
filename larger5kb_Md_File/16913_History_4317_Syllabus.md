> **Introduction  
>  ** A detailed survey of Tudor-Stuart English history (ca. 1485-1688), this
course combines lectures with readings from a textbook, several monographs and
various class-handouts. The intention is to provide an introduction to issues,
personalities, movements and developments of the Tudor-Stuart era, by
examining in some detail political, governmental, social, economic, cultural
and legal topics. Lectures and discussions will be the basis for introducing
the bulk of the material covered, as well as serving as the organizing medium.
Much of what you will study will come from the lectures and discussions. Since
I frequently approach topics differently from that of the textbook, your
attendance at and understanding of lectures is imperative. The textbook should
be used primarily to supplement and enlarge upon lecture and discussion
material. The other readings are of a more specific nature and should be
treated as such.

>

> **Course Requirements  
>  ** Regular class attendance is not only required but expected--exams will
be based on the lectures as well as the readings. You must complete the three
exams and submit the written assignment (in a timely fashion) to fulfill this
course's requirements. Make-up exams are not given unless a medical emergency
or your participation in an official university function prevents attendance
on the day(s) of the exam(s). In either case, you must submit the appropriate
documentation legitimizing and justifying your absence. Make-up exams will be
given on 1 December 1997, without exception. The required readings and
tentative lecture topics are detailed below. Note that your research project
is due by/on 1 December 1997. More information regarding the exams and the
written assignment will be forthcoming in class.

>

> **Course Objectives  
>  ** This course provides students with opportunity 1) to broaden their
knowledge of world history by focusing on the history of England circa
1485-1689; 2) to enhance their historical knowledge of cultural issues; 3) to
acquire skills to undertake historical research; 4) to further develop their
ability to read with comprehension; and 5) to further develop their ability to
communicate effectively in oral, written and electronic fashion.

>

> **Grading  
>  ** Grading is based on the following scale:

>

> A.......90-100  
>  B.......80-89  
>  C.......70-79  
>  D.......60-69  
>  F.......59 & below  
>

>

> Your grade will reflect your performance on the three exams and the research
project. All four items are weighted equally, each being worth 25% of your
final grade.

>

> **Drop Policy  
>  ** The deadline for an automatic 'W' is 17 September 1997. Through this
date you automatically receive a 'W' if you drop this course. However, because
your first exam is not until 10/1-3 1997, you may still receive a 'W' if you
drop this course by 17 October 1997\. Drops after 17 October 1997 do not
automatically entitle you to a 'W'; only those students who drop thereafter
with a current passing average will be given a 'W'--all others shall receive a
grade of 'F'.

>

> **Note-taking Suggestions  
>  ** Because this is an upper-division course, I assume that you come with a
measure of experience in note-taking. Nevertheless, let me offer a few
suggestions that might facilitate note-taking in this history course.

>

> 1) Be aware of the topic at hand.

>

> 2) For each new topic, write the lecture outline at the top of a new page.

>

> 3) Leave a margin (perhaps one-fourth of the page).

>

> 4) Listen first, then write notes, not verbatim transcripts, of what we
discuss (most definitely including what you & your colleagues have to offer
during the discussion).

>

> 5) Impose the outline on your notes.

>

> 6) Use your readings to add more information to items/topics which I treat
rather briefly.

>

> 7) Review your notes before the next classmeeting, especially the last
material introduced.

>

> Please keep pace with the readings. You cannot expect to read all the
material assigned the day before the exam, while sifting through the lecture
notes for exam items.

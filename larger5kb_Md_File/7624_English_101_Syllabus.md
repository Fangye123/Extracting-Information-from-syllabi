EH 101 aims to develop your writing skills. The essays you will write in this
class are different from academic or technical writing in that instead of
presuming the interest of their readers (as does, say, a manual on programming
your VCR) they attempt to earn it. This course will focus on improving your
rhetorical ability to engage an audience.

As part of this, we will study how to identify and use effective details,
apply voice in your writing, and develop technical and grammatical skills. We
will also study other essays and texts (whether good or bad) to identify how
they work or fail at these elements. An assigned research paper will
familiarize you with using sources to support your own ideas. Yes, this means
going to the library. But it also means exploring what you think and not
merely what others have thought before you. In this class, you will write from
your own point of view, not your high school English teacher's, not your
parents, and not mine.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/snoopy.gif)  **Paper & Assignment
Policy**:

All assignments, including paper drafts, must be typed and turned in when they
are due. Failure to do so will result in lowering your assignment's final
grade by two letter grades per day late. (This means a paper submitted two
days late can earn a maximum grade of an "F"!) You must submit two copies of
all final papers. Be aware, computer catastrophes do happen. It your
responsibility to make back-up copies on disk and/or hard copies.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/pencil1b.gif)  **Revision Policy:**

Any of the five main papers may be revised and submitted for a higher grade if
it received a C+ or lower grade. The grade on the revision will replace the
previous paper grade. The revision must be substantially improved (not just
fixed grammar and spelling) and must be handed in no later than one week after
the paper was returned to you in class. You must include the original copy of
the paper with my grade and comments on it. You are strongly encouraged to
meet with me and/or a tutor in the Writing Center (Morgan Hall Room 125) to
give you feedback on how to revise the essay.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/hotbuta.GIF)  **Academic Honesty:**

The severest penalties, including suspension or expulsion, will be recommended
for students who turn in work that is not their own. The bottom line:
PLAGIARISM IS NOT AN OPTION!

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/coffee0a.gif)  **Conferences and
Office Hours:**

You will attend one or two scheduled conferences this semester to discuss your
writing with me. However, I encourage you to stop by during my office hours or
by appointment to speak with me regarding any issues relevant to the class. If
you schedule a conference and fail to show up without prior notice, it will
count as an absence for the course.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/clothe0b.gif)  **Attendance:**

Regular attendance and participation are a must for this course. Three
absences are allowed for personal or medical reasons. You do not need to
provide an excuse. Attendance will be taken promptly at the start of class, so
be punctual. 2 TARDIES=1 ABSENCE. Each absence beyond three will reduce your
final grade by one grade increment; that is, if you have four absences, an A-
will become a B+. Conversely, perfect attendance will raise your grade by one
grade increment. Any absence accumulated beyond six will result in a grade of
"NC" for the course.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/bob.gif)  **Class Disruptions:**

All cell phones must be turned off before class. If your cell phone rings
during class, you have rudely disturbed the class and will be asked to leave,
thus accumulating an absence for the course. If you need to have a cell phone
because of an emergency situation, you must informme before the start of
class. Any other overt class disrutptions will result in similar penalties.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/point0a.gif)   **Grades:**

The following factors will be averaged to arrive at your final grade in the
course:  
| 4 Papers (10% each) | 40% | 400 points  
---|---|---|---  
| Research Paper | 15% | 150 points  
| Daily Exercises | 10% | 100 points  
| Online Writing Assignments | 20% | 200 points  
| Final Exam | 15% | 150 points  
| **TOTAL** | **100%** | **1,000 pts**  
  
  
Consult the table below to translate your percentage of points into a letter
grade and to translate letter grades into exact point values to calculate your
overall grade in the course. Keep in mind that an overall grade of C- or
higher is required to pass this course.

| **Grade** | **Percent **| **Points**  
---|---|---|---  
|  A+ | 98-100% | 100  
| A | 93-97% | 95  
| A- | 90-92% | 91  
| B+ | 88-89% | 88  
| B | 83-87% | 85  
| B- | 80-82% | 81  
| C+ | 78-79% | 78  
| C | 73-77% | 75  
| C- | 70-72% | 71  
| D+ | 68-69% | 68  
| D | 63-67% | 65  
| D- | 60-62% | 61  
| F | 59% or less | 0  
  


![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/oldbook.gif)**Grade Appeals:**

If you have questions about our overall grading procedure or about a
particular grade, make an appointment to discuss the matter with me. If the
result of the conference is unsatisfactory, you may request a second reading
by another instructor. Students who have complaints must notify me within a
week after the paper was returned. In no case will paper grades be reviewed
more than two weeks after the paper has been returned.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/geog0a.gif)  **ADA Statement:**

If you need special accommodations due to a disability, please meet with me so
that we may discuss your situation. The Office of Disability Services can be
reached at 345-5175.

![](http://bama.ua.edu/~oberl001/graphics/trash.gif)  **Final Note:**

As you will learn in this course, all writing can be revised, which includes
this syllabus. Please bring this and your course schedule with you every day
to class to mark any possible changes.

**Course description:**  
** **  
This course will provide a survey of European history from the late Middle
Ages through the early seventeenth century.  The course will emphasize the
history of ideas, including religious and scientific ideas, but considerable
attention will also be paid to social and political history.  A principal goal
will to be gain intensive experience with close reading, discussion, and
written analysis of primary sources.  We will also acquaint ourselves with the
insights and debates of modern scholars.

assignments.  Participation will be graded at the end of the course in whole
grades (i.e., A, B, C, etc., with no plus or minus).  Grades for your writing
and participation will be based primarily  on the signs that you show of
having given serious thought to the course materials.  In calculating your
grade for the course, I will give credit for improvement.  Feel free to
consult me as we go along about how you are doing.  
    
**Attendance:**  
** **  
Attendance is required at all class meetings.  As a courtesy, please inform me
of the reason for any absence (in advance, if possible).  Students who miss
more than four class meetings may be dropped from the course.  Since much of
the work for this course involves the close reading and discussion of assigned
readings, students who come to class unprepared will be counted as absent.
Late papers will be penalized one third of a grade for each day late (i.e., an
A will be reduced to an A-, and A- to a B+, and so on).  Incompletes will be
assigned only in case of documentable emergency.  
    
**Academic integrity:**  
** **  
All work in this course will be governed by the Academic Integrity Policies of
Austin College.  By enrolling in this course, you agree to inform yourself
about these policies and to abide by them.  Although you are encouraged to
discuss the course material with other students, the work you do in this
course must be your own.  In particular, when you submit a paper, it must
contain your own ideas in your own words.  Ideas or information that you get
elsewhere -- from a friend, a professor, a book in the library, or any other
source -- must be acknowledged specifically.  This is true even when you are
not quoting directly.  Paraphrasing someone else's ideas does not make them
your own.

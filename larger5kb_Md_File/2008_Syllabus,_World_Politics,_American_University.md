### Description

_World Politics_ provides an overview of the field of international relations.
It is neither a review of contemporary international history nor a discussion
of current events. Rather, we survey a variety of perspectives, frameworks,
theories, and hypotheses which help to make sense of both history and current
events. Topics to be covered include state sovereignty, power and hegemony,
foreign policymaking, armament and disarmament, peacekeeping, international
political economy, international law, and war and morality.

This is primarily a lecture course, but class discussion will allow for
further exploration of the most interesting and controversial topics. In
addition, you will be participating in an internet-based diplomatic simulation
as representatives of a particular country. This exercise requires that you to
put into "practice" some of the elements you learn from lectures, discussion,
and reading.

_World Politics_ is one of ten foundation courses in the [General Education
Program's](http://www.gened.american.edu/) Curricular Area 3, "International
and Intercultural Experience." You may complete the two-course sequence by
taking one of following second-level courses:

  * 12.200 The Global Marketplace 
  * 17.280 Contemporary Media in Global Society 
  * 29.225 Russia: Past and Present 
  * 29.260 To Arms: People and Nations at War 
  * 33.215 Competition in an Interdependent World 
  * 33.372 Brussels Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * 33.375 Berlin Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * 37.200 Russia and the United States 
  * 53.434 London Semester (Study Abroad) 
  * 65.225 Contemporary Arab World 
Each of these courses explores in more depth a topic introduced by _World
Politics_. You can enhance the learning experience of this foundation course
by further study in one of the areas you find most interesting.

  

### Requirements and Evaluation

Course grades are based in part on a midterm (20%) and a comprehensive final
(30%) examination. These examinations consist of questions requiring both
short answers and longer essays. Your grade will also be based on an
evaluation of your performance in the simulation (35%) which, in addition to
the formal simulation itself, will include preparing a policy paper and a
debriefing. The remainder of your grade (15%) is to be determined from
attendance and participation in class discussion.

  

### Reading Materials

Readings are assigned from the following course book, available at the [
Campus Store](http://www.bookstore.american.edu/CShome.html):

  * [ International Relations](http://www.american.edu/goldtext/jghome.htm), second edition, by Joshua S. Goldstein. Harper Collins, 1996\. 

In addition to the text, you should be reading, on a regular basis, the
[_Washington Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/) or some other newspaper
with thorough international coverage. Your performance in the course will
reflect your familiarity with current international issues, and not just an
understanding of lecture and textbook materials. Finally, you will be doing a
good bit of reading not directly related to the lectures in the process of
preparing for the simulation.

  

### Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized possession of
examinations, and alteration of grades or markings on returned work. These and
other forms of academic dishonesty are discussed in AU's _Academic Integrity
Code_. If you are in doubt especially about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
or collaboration, please consult me. Any examination or assignment tainted by
academic dishonesty will automatically receive a _grade of F_. University
regulations _require_ that the incident be reported to the Dean of the School
of International Service, who will determine the appropriateness of further
disciplinary action.

## SIMULATION INFORMATION

A central feature of this course is participation in a diplomatic simulation
conducted by Project ICONS -- **I** nternational **Co** mmunication and **N**
egotiation **S** imulations -- at the University of Maryland. Participants
assume the roles of foreign policy makers and negotiate via online
conferencing on behalf of the nations they represent. This semester we are
representing [ China, Israel, and Mexico](teamss98.html). You will grapple
with such problems as the international debt crisis, human rights violations,
north-south relations and development issues, arms control, the balance of
trade, nuclear proliferation, and global environmental concerns. The exercise
proceeds in [three phases](phases98.html):

  * Phase 1: **PREPARATION** (1 February to 29 March)  
During this initial phase, you become familiar with the scenario and spend
time researching your country's positions on the key international issues
identified. You will also acquire the computer skills necessary for
participation.  

  * Phase 2: **SIMULATION** (30 March to 1 May)  
During this five-week period, country-teams exchange messages, participate in
multilateral conferences, and update their own policies and negotiating
strategies in response to developments in the simulated world.  

  * Phase 3: **DEBRIEFING** (2 May to 4 May)  
This short phase involves a review and self-assessment of your participation
in the simulation. You may revisit the sequences of messages in an effort to
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of particular series of negotiations.

More information about the simulation is available from the [Project ICONS
homepage](http://www.bsos.umd.edu/icons/). See especially "Scenarios" for a
description of the sorts of issues addressed during the Fall 1997 simulation.
The scenario for Spring 1998 will be similar. Any computer linked to the
internet and running a web browser, which includes those at AU's computing
labs, will be able to connect to the ICONS simulation computer. See
"Connection Information" for more details. Other information on the ICONS
homepage will become relevant after we begin the simulation.  

  

Participation in the ICONS simulation is being made possible by a grant from
AU's Office of Academic Affairs.

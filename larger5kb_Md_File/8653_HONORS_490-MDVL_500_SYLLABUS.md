This course will explore chapters in the historical development of writing and
the creation of the book from the clay tablets of ancient times to the
hypertext forms of today. The impact of writing and of the book on society
will be the means by which we trace this set of developments over time. To
trace this impact, a number of our readings will look at the concept of
literacy as it developed over time. Through readings, discussions, field
trips, and public lectures by distinguished visiting scholars, students will
examine crucial topics in the nature and development of the book.

The class will read Henri-Jean Martin's _The History and Power of Writing_
(University of Chicago Press, 1994). The ten chapters of this book parallel
the themes to be treated in the course in describing the development of
writing and the hand-written book, the initial transformations in written
culture created by the arrival of printing, and subsequent changes wrought by
technological revolutions. Students will also read Barbara Shailor's _The
Medieval Book_ , a short but valuable account of the formation and the various
forms of the hand-written book. L. G. Reynolds and N. G. Wilson _Scribes &
Scholars_ is recommended as a means of following the transmission of Greco-
Roman culture through the development of the book.

WORK OF THE COURSE: This course requires completion of a moderately heavy
reading list. Classes will normally combine presentations, discussion, and
hands-on examination of books. The course offers a brief introduction to a
large and complex topic, and must assume a reasonably solid background in
European and American history. More attention will be paid to developments in
the West than in the rest of the world. Reading assignments will be made in
materials written or available in English. These tend to emphasize the
English-speaking world. Students who wish to write papers which investigate
topics not directly covered in class presentations, however, are invited to do
so after consulting with the instructors.

Students must write THREE PAPERS (8-12 pages each (DUE OCTOBER 8; NOVEMBER 5;
DECEMBER 10). The instructors reserve the right to give either a midterm or a
final examination in this course if a noticeably low level of class discussion
appears to warrant them. Otherwise, the papers (@30%) and classroom
participation (10%) will count towards your grade. Suggested paper topics,
which should be based upon assigned class readings with suggested readings,
are sprinkled throughout the syllabus; other topics should be chosen in
consultation with the instructors. Students encountering a subject for the
first time are NOT expected to write publishable research papers. Having said
this, papers should: 1) demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the
available resources on its topic; 2) show an awareness and understanding of
the historical and intellectual issues which it raises; and 3) marshal the
evidence to argue and defend a case, a point of view, about your topic. No
thesis, no paper. The instructors regard with extreme disfavor requests for
grades of "Incomplete."

### READING:

The following texts have been ordered through the University bookstore:

Henri-Jean Martin, _The History and Power of Writing_ , trans. Lydia G.
Cochrane (1988; Chicago and London: University of Chicago press, 1994--

In order to keep costs manageable, no other books have been ordered for
purchase; the reading required by this course, however, will prove moderately
extensive. Copies of many assigned articles, book chapters, and books have
been put on reserve, although some are available on the shelves of the Waldo
Library. Please remember that several of you will be looking for the same
texts; if you don't leave the books in Waldo's stacks, the instructors will

11) 12 November: Enlightenment and Revolution--18th century

READ: Martin, chap. 8; Lawrence C. Wroth, The Colonial Printer, 2nd ed. (1938;
rpt. Charlottesville, Va: Univ. Press of Virginia, 1964), chaps. 1-9, p.
3-190; Rollo G. Silver, The American Printer 1787-1825 (Charlottesville, VA:
Published for the Bibliographical Society of the Univ. of Virginia [by] the
Univ. Press of Virginia, 1967), chaps. 1-3, p. 1-96; Steinberg, 500 Years of
Printing, p. 119-197; and as much as you can of Robert Darnton, The Literary
Underground of the Old Regime (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1982), esp.
chaps. 1, 4-6, p. 1-40, 122-208; Darnton, The Great Cat Massacre and Other
Episodes in French Cultural History (New York: Basic Books, 1984), chaps. 2,
4, p. 75-106, 145-190; R. S. Schofield, "Dimensions of Illiteracy in England
1750-1850," in Literacy and Social Development, ed. Graff, p. 201-213; Kenneth
A. Lockridge, "Literacy in Early America 1650-1800," in Literacy and Social
Development, ed. Graff, p. 183-200.

PAPER: Discuss the significance of Darnton, The Business of Enlightenment: A
Publishing History of the Encyclopedie 1775-1800 (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ.
Press, 1979) in terms of the work (and publishing) as a revolutionary act.
Compare Darnton's views of the Encyclopedie with Dominick LaCapra, Soundings
in Critical Theory (Ithaca, NY: Cornell Univ. Press, 1989), chap. 3, p. 67-89.

PAPER: Look at Edwin Wolf II, The Book Culture of a Colonial American City:
Philadelphia Books, Bookmen, and Booksellers, Lyell Lectures in Bibliography,
1985-6 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988) for the establishment of the book in
the new world. How unique are the developments in Philadelphia (compare with
Wroth on Boston or New York)?

PAPER: Read Alvin B. Kernan, Printing Technology, Letters, and Samuel Johnson
(Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1987) and discuss its significance (if any)
for thinking about eighteenth-century publishing history. Has it also any
significance for the

ways in which we might approach the "movable-type-as-revolutionary"
explanations of Eisenstein and her epigones for the fifteenth through the
seventeenth centuries?

PAPER: Describe the connections between literacy, the press, and the American
political process. Read the essays by Botein and Buel (p. 11-97) in The Press
and the American Revolution, ed. Bernard Bailyn and John B. Hench (Worcester,
MA: American Antiquarian Society, 1980) with Richard L. Rubin, Press, Party,
and Presidency (New York: W. W. Norton, 1981).

PAPER: Darnton, together with some of the earlier history you have read,
suggests something of the ambiguous social position of those engaged in the
book arts. Is that ambiguity in the periods he discusses like that you have
seen in the earlier periods? Is it likely to have any noticeable impact on the
books we see, or is this merely a matter of perverse interest to social
historians? Darnton, Davis, Eisenstein, and some of the early printer
biographies are all likely to be useful for this question.

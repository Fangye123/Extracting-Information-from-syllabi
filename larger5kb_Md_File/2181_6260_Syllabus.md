16. | 12/7 Tuesday |  **Final Exams Due**  
  
**Academic Misconduct Policy:**

In accordance with University policy, instances of cheating on examinations,
plagiarism, or other offenses that violate rules of fair conduct will be
reported to the Faculty-Student Committee on Discipline for investigation.

**Responsibilities:**

In order to achieve the expectations and objectives listed for this course, it
seems to me that we are obliged to share a number of responsibilities. I am
responsible in large measure for making the course a viable, interesting and
worthwhile experience. You in turn are responsible for helping to achieve
these goals. You must not only feel free to discuss issues and ideas dealt
with in class--you  
_must_ do so if our dialogue is to have the desired payoff. I am assuming that
class sessions will be worthwhile and that you will attend. I am also assuming
that you will complete the assigned readings and that it makes sense to do so.
I hope that you will extend beyond the recommended readings in search of
answers to questions you have about teaching social studies. In the final
analysis, your responsibilities, as I view them, are not to me, but to
yourselves, to your classmates, and to your students.

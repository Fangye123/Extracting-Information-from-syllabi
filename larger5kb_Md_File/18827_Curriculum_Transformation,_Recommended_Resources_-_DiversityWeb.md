## Transformed Courses Within the Disciplines

**

Humanities**

  * [ The Women and Social Movements Website](http://womhist.binghamton.edu/), SUNY-Binghamton  
This website provides primary documents related to women and social movements
in the United States between 1820 and 1940 in order to support new ways for
students, teachers, and scholars to study American history. The site is
organized around editorial projects undertaken by undergraduate and graduate
students at the State University of New York at Binghamton. Current projects
include ones focusing on issues of race, ethnicity, and class. Each project is
organized around a question, provides about twenty related documents and
additional images, a bibliography, and a listing of related www links. A
Teacher's Corner currently offers about sixty lesson plans and assignments to
facilitate use of the primary documents on the website in high school and
college courses in United States history.  
  

  * [New American Literature](http://www.diversityweb.org/Leadersguide/CT/Courses/zandy.html), Rochester Institute of Technology  
Taught by Janet Zandy, this literature course examines the diversity and
complexity of the American literary landscape. Students are asked to reflect
on their own cultural identities as they look at the intersections between
history and literature.  
  

  * [American Identity -- Class and Work](Transformed_courses/linkon.html), Youngstown State University  
Taught by Sherry Linkon in Fall 1996, this American Studies course asked
students to explore the meaning of work and class in American culture, with
discussions on the history and the future of work, the class structure in the
U.S., how class intersects with other elements of identity (gender, race, age,
region, sexuality), and American myths and messages about work.  
  

  * [Introducing American Studies](http://www.georgetown.edu/crossroads/syllabi/brown-intro.html), Brown University   
This Web site offers a final report to the National Endowment for the
Humanities from Brown University, for a grant which allowed the department to
revise its introductory course (AC75) to better reflect the multicultural
nature of American culture as well as to introduce new pedagogical methods
into college teaching. The new course began in September of 1996 seeking to
break down the fifty minute lecture into panel discussions, mini-lectures, and
group work in class. In the report they note: "The process of plan ning the
new course and the course itself will serve as models for other classes at
Brown, for introductory courses in American Studies, for college and high
school classes interested in issues of multiculturalism and in introducing the
American experience in new ways to a range of students." A link to the
syllabus is also included.  
  

  * [Introduction to Asian American Studies](Transformed_courses/intro_asian.html), the University of Michigan  
Created by Gail Nomura this course, offered through the Program in American
Culture, provides an introductory study of the experience of Asian immigrants
and their citizen descendants in the United States from the mid-nineteenth
century to the present. The groups covered include Chinese, Filipino,
Japanese, Korean, Pacific Islander, South Asian, and Southeast Asian
Americans. Students discuss international/domestic relations, immigration
policy, ethnic adaptive strategies, ethnic community building, constitutional
issues, majority/minority relations, and literary expressions.  
  

  * [Philosophical Issues: Prejudice and Discrimination](Transformed_courses/philosophical_Issues.html), SUNY Cortland  
Taught by Kathryn Russell in the Department of Philosophy as part of the
General Education program, this course looked at strategies of social change,
evaluating them as ways to enhance freedom, justice, and equality. The course
scrutinizes institutionalized patterns of behavior which allow racism and
sexism to persist.  
  

  * [Rethinking American History: The Asian American Experience](Transformed_courses/rethinking.html), the University of Michigan  
This [first year seminar](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/dean/ug/fys/), taught in
Fall 1996 by Gail Nomura, uses Ronald Takaki's _Strangers from a Different
Shore_ and additional readings to rethink and re-envision the multicultural
nature of American history through the study of one of the varied ethnic
cultures that form  "American" culture, the Asian American experience in U.S.
history.  

  
  

  * [Law, Society, Difference](Courses/phil340.html), San Francisco State University  
This upper-division course taught at by Anita Silvers, was designed to fit
into a sequence of philosophy courses on law and social philosophy. It brings
together students with somewhat different interests in disability: students
with disabilities, students whose family members are disabled or aging
noticeably, students who have family histories pre-disposing them to
disability, students who are majoring in fields concerned with disability,
students headed for law school, and others.  
  

**

Social Sciences**

  * [Intercultural Communication](http://www.diversityweb.org/Leadersguide/CT/Courses/swanson.html), US International University  
Taught by Linda Swanson, this course explores communication, culture, and
intercultural communication. Interdisciplinary in nature, this course focuses
on the need to develop self-understanding as a first step to intercultural
understanding and begins the process of building competencies which may
facilitate effective communications in all types of cross-cultural settings.  
  

  * [Ethnic Identity and Intergroup Relations](http://www.diversityweb.org/Leadersguide/CT/Courses/soc412.html), the University of Michigan  
Taught by David Schoem, this sociology course looks at multi-racial, multi-
ethnic, and multi-faith identities and relationships as focal points for the
exploration of a wide range of questions on racial, ethnic and religious
identity and intergroup relations. Frameworks for community building are
discussed, taking into account issues of conflict and power and competing
social interests.  
  

  * [Transforming a Developmental Psychology Course](Transformed_courses/developpsyc.html), SUNY Buffalo   
Jack Meacham, professor of psychology at the State University of New York-
Buffalo, describes the principles he used to incorporate diversity into a
departmental course and the influence on his teaching in a general education
course on American Pluralism and the Search for Equality. The syllabus is
included. Also, [click

to read an essay by Professor Meacham describing his experience working with
student resistance to the diversity curriculum in this course.

**

Sciences**

  * [Understanding the Biological Basis for Global Change](http://www.acad.carleton.edu/curricular/BIOL/classes/bio190/index3.html), Carleton College  
This course is a broad survey of human impact on the biosphere and climate.
Students will develop the skills to understand the biological basis for global
change and to help them become an active participant in developing solutions
for mitigating such change.

  
  

  * [Science, Gender and Social Context](http://www.corners.pdx.edu/sciencegender/), Portland State University  
This course explores the issue of global climate change from two directions:
1) the relationship between human use of energy resources and the global
atmosphere; 2) the public policy debates swirling around the problem of
reducing the human causes of environmental degradation. One of the main tools
for examining global climate change and from examining public policy is
computer modeling. A goal of this course is to develop students' ability to
understand a computer model, to understand the limitations as well as the
analytic power of computer models, and to apply this technique to
environmental science and policy questions. Another goal of the course is to
introduce students to feminist perspectives on both environmental
sustainability and economic development. A third goal of the course is to
provide a framework through which we can examine how social, political, and
economic instituitions and culture shape both the scientific and public policy
enterprises.

  
  

  * [ Biology Project Website](http://www.biology.arizona.edu/), University of Arizona  
The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has provided a grant to Dr. Michael
Gottfredsen, University of Arizona Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education,
to support a design team charged with developing the general structure and
supportive materials needed to deliver student-oriented, highly interactive
learning materials on the World Wide Web. These learning materials are used to
support the lecture, laboratory and discussion sessions of general education
courses.

  
  

  * [Issues in Women's Health](http://www.rowan.edu/mars/depts/biology/faculty/tahamont/sswmnshl.htm), Rowan University   
This interdisciplinary course critically examines issues in women's health.
Biological, socio-cultural, psychological, historical and political processes
that shape and define women's health and healthcare experiences will be
explored, including ways in which medical knowledge has been contructed and
applied to women's bodies. The normal physiology and pathophysiology will be
presented within the broader context of social, cultural and historical
interpretations. It is a primary goal to explore these significant questions:
How has the physical functioning of the human female body been interpreted by
the scientific community? How have these interpretations shaped the type and
quality of medical treatment available to women? What has been done to change
ideas about women's bodies and the health care offered to women? What is the
link between cultural perceptions of women, women's status and the management
of women's bodies?

  
  

  * [Cultures of Biology, Medicine, Gender, and Race](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lbriggs/ws210.html), University of Arizona  
Are women's brains different from men's? Is there a gay gene? Are we really
ruled by our hormones? Does testosterone make men more aggressive? Are there
racial differences in intelligence? How much is temperament inherited? Can
women get AIDS from "normal" sex? What about lesbians? This Tier II course
(which fulfills the gender, race, ethnicity requirement) looks at how meanings
of gender and race are influenced by popular conceptions of biology and
medicine. It explores controversial topics such as gender difference in brain
anatomy, genetic models of gayness and of intelligence, reproductive
technology, hormones, and AIDS.

  
  

  * [ The Laboratory and Social Life of Genes](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~lbriggs/ws195A-Z.html), University of Arizona  
The objectives of this course are: to explore the historical, social and
political life of genes as important mobilizers in contemporary culture; to
learn the biological precepts governing the science of genes; and to integrate
understanding of this hybrid notion of a gene and how it affects public
policy, human health and everyday societal concerns.

  
  

  * [Women and Scientific Literacy: Building Two-Way Streets](http://www.aacu-edu.org/Initiatives/scilit.html#overview), the Association of American Colleges and Universities  
The Women and Scientific Literacy Project seeks to make science more
attractive to women by expanding the content and teaching methods of the
science curriculum in higher education, both within traditional science
departments and within humanities and social science courses. Made possible by
an award from the National Science Foundation and with leadership from AAC&U's
Program on the Status and Education of Women, this initiative brings together
ten competitively chosen colleges and universities in a three-year curriculum
and faculty development project.

Studies About Class**

  * [American Identity -- Class and Work](Transformed_courses/linkon.html), Youngstown State University  
Taught by Sherry Linkon in Fall 1996, this American Studies course asked
students to explore the meaning of work and class in American culture, with
discussions on the history and the future of work, the class structure in the
U.S., how class intersects with other elements of identity (gender, race, age,

  * [The University of Washington: A Working Relationship](http://www.edweek.org/ew/vol-15/23seat.h15) by Deborah L. Cohen   
As described in _Education Week_ , the University of Washington's Training for
Interprofessional Collaboration program draws its faculty and students from
the graduate schools of education, public health and community medicine,
nursing, social work, and public affairs. Students who enroll in the six-month
program participate in a series of seminars and a team project in the
community. In this article Cohen examines the challenges which arise when
forging interdisciplinary connections while cultivating concern for community-
building.  
  

  * [Program on Intergroup Relations, Conflict, and Community](http://www.umich.edu/~igrc/), University of Michigan   
The Intergroup Relations, Conflict, and Community (IGRCC) program links formal
education course work to the social experiences of the students outside of the
classroom. The Program offers first-year seminars, intergroup dialogues,
facilitator training and practicum courses, training courses for university
residence hall staff, advanced courses on intergroup relations, consultation
and workshops, and resource center on intergroup relations.  
  

**Women's Studies**

of women's bodies?

  
  

  * [ Feminisim and Science Studies](http://www.aacu-edu.org/Initiatives/barnard.html), Barnard College   
This seminar investigates socially and historically informed critiques of
theoretical methods and practices of the sciences. We will ask if/how feminist
theoretical and political concerns make a critical contribution to science
studies. The course will begin with philosophical and methodological critiques
and will move onto historical and field specific topics, such as reproductive
biology; biological constructions of gender, sex, and race; environmental
science and ecofeminism; studies of sexualities; reproductive technologies;
and physics.

  
  

  * [ Women in Science and Engineering](http://www.aacu-edu.org/Initiatives/bates.html), Bates College   
Imagine a world where women make up fifty percent of the scientific community.
Can this ever happen? How? Would the practice or content of science be
different in such a world? This course examines the status of women in science
through an exploration of the lives, times and works of women scientists, past
and present. In addition we will describe and analyze the historical and
contemporary barriers to women's full participation in science, engineering
and mathematics (SEM). First individually, and then collectively, we will come
up with a plan for the future which would improve the quality of life for
women (and men) as scientists and increase the number of women in science.

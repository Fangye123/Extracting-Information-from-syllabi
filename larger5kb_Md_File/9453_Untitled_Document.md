HISTORY OF WOMEN AND SOCIETY IN THE ISLAMIC MIDDLE EAST

This course examines major developments, themes, and problems in women's
history in the Middle East from the advent of Islam in the seventh century to
the present. By studying legal and cultural constructions and social dynamics
of phenomena such as marriage, sexual morality, women's use of space, or
women's access to property and the legal system over time, we seek to shed
light on the functioning of women within society and to refute the notion of
the immutability of gender inequalities in Middle Eastern Islamic societies.
In the first part of the course we probe the much-debated issue of the
historical origins of gender inequalities in the Islamic Middle East. In the
second part, we examine specific areas and aspects of gender ideology and of
the status and roles of women. We make use, in particular, of recent studies
based on Ottoman court records that illuminate the reality of women's life as
opposed to the idealized picture enshrined in prescriptive literature. The
third part of the course is devoted to the transformations that have taken
place in the construction of gender and in the status and roles of Middle
Eastern women since the nineteenth century. Here the emphasis is both on the
nature and scope of these transformations and on the historical circumstances
that have led to, or impeded, change.

**_EARLY AMERICAN LITERATURE  
__A SAMPLE COURSE DESCRIPTION _**

**DESCRIPTION OF COURSE:  
  
** An informally presented reading/discussion course on early American writers  
showing the philosophies behind the works and their impact in the American  
conscience.  
  
**EVALUATION TECHNIQUES:**

  1. Series of announced quizzes (plot level and identification of characters)  
on works read.

  2. Equally weighted midterm (identification and discussion of ideas and style   
in selected reading excerpts) and optional final.

  3. Short outside paper (5-7 pages) on modern American writer of your choice  
from this time period.

**BOOKS USED** :

  * **_Anthology of American Literature_** , Vol. I, George McMichael, ed   
Selections by Bradford, Taylor, Edwards, Hawthorne, Paine, Franklin,  
Emerson, Thoreau, Poe, Melville.

  * **_Moby Dick,_** Herman Melville, Norton Ed.
  * **_Wieland or the Transformation,_** Charles Brockden Brown.

* * *

**CRITERIA FOR FINDING THEMES  
  
** Throughout our analysis, we must be guided by a clear idea of what we  
are looking for--a theme that **_fits_** the story, in that it gives meaning
to every part  
and is suggested by every part. More specifically, the theme should meet some  
such criteria as the following:  1

  1. An adequate interpretation should account for every prominent detail in the  
story. This is the most important criterion. Perhaps the commonest error in  
analysis is fixing upon a theme which ignores a number of conspicuous events.  
And perhaps the second most common error is giving these events a strained  
or farfetched meaning so as to make them fit.

  2. An adequate interpretation should not be contradicted by any details of the  
story. The author is trying to communicate something; he will not willingly
defeat  
his own purpose. Rather like a good scientist, a reader should be sensitive to  
contradictory evidence and be ready to change his interpretation if necessary.

  3. An interpretation should not rest upon evidence not clearly stated or implied  
by the story. Some readers of Conrad's "The Secret Sharer" account for the  
strange resemblance of Legatt to the captain by assuming the two to be long-
lost  
twins; others account for the captain's sympathy for this murderer by assuming
a  
secret murder in the captain's past. Unfortunately, there is no evidence in
the story  
for either idea. One reason for this sort of error is the unhappily common
phrase  
"the hidden meaning," suggesting that the author is a human pack rat, forever  
hiding things away.

  4. Finally, the interpretation should be directly suggested by the story. In other   
words, if the theme is courage, we may expect to see some explicit appearance  
of or reference to courage. Some persons, having read a poem describing a  
day from sunrise to sunset, immediately assume that it symbolizes man's life  
from birth to death. But, if the author means this, why hasn't he
**_referred_** to  
man's life, if only in the title or an incidental metaphor? Similarly, we must
not  
assume that every story that contains a bear is an allegorical comment upon  
the Russian situation.

  5. Unfortunately, these lists of approaches and criteria may seem to imply that   
interpreting a story is a mechanical process. We should remember that to look  
for the theme is, after, all, simply to ask ourselves, "Why did the author
write  
this story? What made it seem worth writing?" We should remember, too, that  
we gain nothing from having the instructor or a friend tell us what the story  
"mean"\--unless, that is, we apply the knowledge. The profit comes only in  
our ability to see how the theme suffuses the details of the story, how it
gives  
the described experience the focus and depth of reality.

**_OUTSIDE PAPER ASSIGNMENTS FOR LITERATURE CLASSES_**  
  

**_Purpose of the Assignment  
_** To show that you can take a fairly complex piece of literature (not
covered in  
class and new to you) and apply the techniques of analysis used in class to
write  
a paper demonstrating how all parts of the work (characters, incidents, style)  
unite to create an artistic whole around given ideas or themes or attitudes
the  
author is trying to present.  

**_Suggested Choices:_**

1\. A single novel or short story (play, if a drama lit. class; poem if a
poetry  
literature class) of the period covered in class. Check with me if you're not  
sure if your choice is appropriate or adequate or acceptable.  
  
2\. A combination of two or more stories (or plays or poems according to the  
class taken) used for contrast or comparison of an idea or ideas presented.  
You may use works covered in class as part of your contrast and comparison  
material as long as the major focus of your paper is on some new work not  
covered in class.  

3\. A comparison and contrast within different media (e.g., short story to a  
film or play) as long as the major focus is on the genre (fiction drama, or  
poetry) of the course at hand. In a course (such as American Lit. or  
European Lit.) where a country or time period rather than a specific genre  
is stressed, any genre may be chosen as long as the major focus is on a  
written work (rather than a film or live play production) since the course  
is on literature in its written form.  

4\. If a particular writer's themes and styles particularly intrigue you, you  
may attempt to write an original short story, parable, or chapter for a novel  
(play or poem if applicable) copying his style and idea content. Your original  
story must be accompanied by an analysis of how your work is a parody  
or serious copy of the writer you are dealing with. This analysis must be  
included if you make this choice since it will enable me to give you maximum  
credit for your analytical awareness (which is the major focus of this course  
since this is not a creative writing course) even if you do not have a great  
deal of writing talent.  
  
**_Suggested Length:_**  
Five-seven typewritten pages. If you have less or more pages, don't worry,  
but don't pad. However, if you're on the short side, be sure you have been  
as specific as possible and have included adequate examples to have covered  
all relevant parts of the work at hand.

**_Points to Remember:_**

  1. Write the paper with a person in mind who has supposedly read the work,   
but who doesn't understand it. You are attempting to clarify for him or her  
what the idea of the story is and how the parts support it. Give plenty of  
examples explaining why they are relevant. Don't assume information is  
obvious; point out how and why your examples back up the points you  
are presenting.  

  2. Be idea oriented. Don't waste time summarizing or retelling the story.   
Begin with themes within the story (e.g., In _(Name of Story)_.  
_(Name of Author)_ is dealing with the themes of________ , ________,  
and _____________. )  
Then show how all parts of the story relate to these themes (characters,  
incidents, style).  

  3. Choose a work of some merit that is a challenge to you so you will   
grow by attempting it.  

  4. Get started _NOW_.

**Grading Procedure and Requirements for Literature Classes**

  1. **_Quiz grades_ :** This is largely a discussion class. To enable discussion to be   
active and meaningful, however, it is necessary that everyone read a book  
before we begin to examine it. One of the course procedures, therefore, is  
to give a short quiz prior to the discussion of a book, play, group of short  
stories, or essays. These quizzes require a close reading of the book to have  
all characters and incidents firmly in mind, but they do not require
interpretation  
of an event's or character's significance or meaning. The quizzes are
corrected  
n class and are used as a take-off for later discussions on significance since  
items are chosen for their relevance to a writer's important themes and ideas.  
A quiz thus becomes an instant study guide for rereading a book with increased  
awareness. A student is allowed to drop the lowest quiz grade. Because one  
quiz grade may be dropped, no make-ups are allowed for quizzes missed.  
Quizzes usually begin around the second week of the course to allow time for  
presentation of introductory material and/or a sample run-through of some  
shorter pieces of literature to show the procedure we will follow. If you are  
not prepared to take a quiz, attend the class anyway and simply copy quiz  
answers and questions without turning them in, since using them as a guide  
will speed up your reading and understanding of the material.  

  2. **_Mid-Term format:_** The mid-term roughly covers the first half of the course.  
  
The Mid-Term is an identification-significance type of exam. An excerpt from  
each book discussed in class is given to the student, and he/she is asked to:  
  
A. Identify which book or short story, or play it is from by author  
and title.  
B. Identify what incident the excerpt describes, identifying all  
characters by name and function in the story and giving  
generally the who,  
what, when, and where pertaining to the incident.  
C. Discuss the excerpt in terms of relevant themes or ideas it  
presents in the story.  
D. Discuss the stylistic qualities that help identify the excerpt as  
being the identified writer's product.  
  
The mid-term is graded (6 points possible for each excerpt) on a competitive  
scale based on total class performance.  
  
**Note:** The test format will be further explained in class prior to the
exam.  
(The mid-term counts as 3 grades.)  

  3. **_An outside paper:_** The paper must be in analytical form and cover an   
author from the time period studied. See handouts on paper assignment  
choices and format. The book choice must relate to the class focus and  
should be somewhat challenging to you. Ask if you are not sure if a choice  
is appropriate or acceptable. (The outside paper counts as 3 grades.)  

  4. **_Optional final:_** It is the same format as the mid-term but covers only the   
last half of the course. The optional final will count as 3 grades. If a
student  
has a borderline grade and would like to try for a higher grade, he/she may  
elect to take the final. Don't elect to take the final unless you are well
prepared.  

  5. **_Attendance:_** The single factor that correlates most closely with grades in   
this class is attendance. ATTENDANCE WILL BE GRADED. Anyone  
missing more than 10 class sessions will no longer be eligible for a grade  
in the class.  
  
Any student who misses the first week of orientation for this class will not  
be eligible fora grade in the class and will be advised to drop it and retake  
it another quarter. (Note: A student can arrange to have the class taped in  
emergencies to retain his/her attendance. All arrangements are solely the  
responsibility of the student. The student must and notify the instructor  
prior to the absence covered.)  
  
The format of the mid-term and final gives a decided advantage to the  
student who has attended all classes. If a good student entering the class  
with a high level of critical awareness does not attend class, he will find  
that he cannot compete with the equally accomplished students who have  
attended. Attendance can make as much as an entire grade's difference in  
the final analysis. Attend class even for the quiz that you drop, since you  
will never be penalized for being present, and will always miss something  
if you aren't. If you do not like to attend classes regularly or have
difficulty  
doing so, it is strongly recommended that you drop this class and take  
another where attendance is not as important.  

  6. **_Minimal grade requirements_** : A student must take the mid-term and  
turn in an outside paper to receive a grade in the course. If any of the  
above are missing, he/she will receive an NC in the class. If only one is  
missing, he/she is eligible for an Incomplete if he contracts for one before  
he final week of the class. A student cannot expect private tutoring from  
the teacher to make up an Incomplete. If he cannot do the missing work  
on his own, it is recommended that he drop the class before the drop  
deadline and receive a "W". Since a teacher normally does not teach the  
same literature course more than once a year, it is not possible for a student  
to sit in on the class the following quarter. We discourage incompletes except  
in emergency situations since most transfer institutions require that they be  
removed, and it is difficult to come back to material after a lapse of time  
and when new classes are demanding one's attention. Incompletes must  
be made up the quarter after they are given.

**Arts and HumanitiesDivision Policies**

**S** tudents in all Arts and Humanities courses should be aware of the
following:  

  1. **Attendance:  
  
** Attendance for all of our classes is mandatory. The Arts and Humanities
faculty  
feel strongly that Bellevue Community College is not a correspondence school.  
This policy is intended 1) to prevent instructors from having to adjudicate
individual  
excuses, and 2) to recognize that excuses are ultimately irrelevant both here
at  
BCC and in the workplace.  
  
While specific attendance policies are up to individual faculty members, the
Arts  
and Humanities Division recognizes that attending class is perhaps the most
important  
way in which students can set themselves up for success. Conversely, not
attending  
class almost certainly leads to failure.  
  
Students in performance courses (Drama, Music, etc.) are reminded that
attendance  
builds the professional relationship necessary between partners or working
groups.  
  
In order for students to be eligible for a grade in a course, they must not
miss more  
than ten classes for any reason. When absences go beyond ten, instructors may
a)  
give a grade of "F" for the course, b) give a grade of "Z" for the course, or
c) lower  
the final grade as much as they see fit. This does not imply that you may be
absent  
fewer than ten times without seeing an effect on your grade; indeed, we wish
to  
emphasize that any absence undermines your progress and will result in your
having  
to work harder to catch up. Ten absences is merely the figure beyond which you  
cannot go without risking your eligibility for a course grade.  
  
In summary, when you are absent from a class more than ten times in any given  
quarter, you may receive a failing grade. Whatever written policy an
instructor  
has in the syllabus will be upheld by the Arts and Humanities Division in any  
grievance process.  

  2. **Dropping A Course:  
  
** If you decide to drop a course, you are responsible for doing the required
paperwork.  
Should you fail to do so, your name will appear on the final roster and your
instructor  
may elect to give you a "Z" or "F." The instructor is under no obligation to
use the "Z"  
grade under these circumstances. Many instructors, in fact, feel strongly that
students  
who take up seats in this unproductive way are keeping more serious students
from  
getting an education, so they elect to use "F" grades for "phantoms."  

  3. **Classroom Environment:  
  
** The college's "Affirmation of Inclusion, is posted in each classroom and
sets forth the  
expectation that we will all treat one another with respect and dignity
regardless of  
whether or not we agree philosophically. this expectation is in line with the
principle  
of free speech in a free society: we have the right to express unpopular ideas
as long  
as we don't show disrespect for reasonable people who might believe otherwise.  
  
Part of this respect involves professional behavior toward the instructor,
colleagues,  
and the class itself. Disruptive behavior is disrespectful behavior. The Arts
and  
Humanities Division honors the right of its faculty to define "disruptive
behavior,"  
which often involves such things as arriving late, leaving early, leaving
class and then returning, talking while others are trying to hear the
instructor or their group members,  
doing other homework in class, wearing earphones in class, bringing activated
beepers, alarm watches, or cellular phones into class, inappropriate comments
or gestures, etc.  
Such behavior interrupts the educational process. When you are in doubt about
any behavior, consult your instructor during office hours: we recognize the
judgment of  
the instructor as the final authority in these matters.  
  
When disruptive behavior occurs, instructors will speak to the students
concerned.  
Those students are then responsible for ending the disruptions at once.
Failure to  
do so may result in removal of the students from class.  

  4. **Academic Honesty:  
  
** The principle of academic honesty underlies all that we do and applies to
all courses  
at Bellevue Community College. One kind of academic dishonesty is plagiarism,
which  
may take many forms, including, but not limited to, using a paper written by
someone  
else, using printed sources word-for-word without proper documentation, and  
paraphrasing or summarizing the ideas of others without acknowledging the
source.  
In short, plagiarism is passing off someone else's ideas or words as your own;
it  
amounts to intellectual theft--whether or not it was your intention to steal.  
  
Participating in academic dishonesty in any way, including writing a paper or
taking  
a test for someone else, may result in severe penalties. Dishonestly produced
papers automatically receive a grade of "F." The Dean will also be notified of
such conduct,  
and repetition of the behavior may result in suspension from BCC.  
  
Students in English 102 should note that documentation is a major objective of
that  
course, so failure to scrupulously document supporting material in your papers
may  
result in a failing grade for that entire course. Students in all courses
requiring research papers should also note that matters of documentation form
go beyond editing; they  
are closely related to the content of the paper. Improper form in research
papers is  
grounds for failing the paper. Individual instructors will clarify
documentation  
requirements for specific assignments. If you have any doubts as to whether
you  
are documenting properly, do not hesitate to consult your instructor.  

  5. **Reading Level:  
  
** Reading skills are absolutely essential for your success in any college
program.  
The following reading levels are recommended for our courses.  
  
**ENGL 094 or 095** \- 081, 085, 087 reading level  
**ENGL 096 or 097** \- 085, 087, 089 reading level  
**ENGL 098 or 099** \- 087, 089, 106 reading level  
**most 100 level courses** \- high 089, 106, or college level  
**200 level courses** \- 106 or college level  
  
Our experience shows that students reading three levels below the level of a
course  
text can expect to fail the course.  

  6. **The First Week of Classes:  
  
** It is important to attend classes from the very beginning. If you cannot do
so, you  
are responsible for notifying your instructor. Your instructor is in no way
responsible  
for re-teaching material that you missed because of your failure to attend the
first  
classes. Indeed, missing crucial introductory material may affect your
performance  
during the remainder of the course.  

  7. **Classroom Materials:  
  
** Students are responsible for consulting their syllabus daily and bringing
to class  
the appropriate texts and writing materials. Failure to do so does not
constitute  
an excuse from the daily work.  

  8. **Late Work:  
  
** Individual instructors make their own policies on accepting or grading late
work.  
The Arts and Humanities Division believes strongly that honoring deadlines is
essential  
for student success. Consulting your instructor for policies regarding late
work. In  
general, late work may be a) downgraded--as severely as the instructor
chooses,  
b) given no credit, but still be required for passing the course, or c) not
accepted  
at all. The extent to which late work affects grades is up to the instructor.
Instructors  
may also elect not to give feedback to works in progress if required drafts or
plans  
are not turned in on time.  
  
Failure to attend class on the day a paper is due does not constitute an
excuse  
for lateness. Similarly, your missing an exam does not oblige the instructor
to give  
a make-up. Your instructors will give you their individual policies on late
papers  
and missed exams.  
  
All lateness or absence on due days or exam days should be arranged with the  
instructor well in advance.  

  9. **Auditing:  
  
** Auditing a course does not excuse students from doing the work of the
course.  
All auditors need to meet with the instructor during the first week to sign a  
contract specifying the level of participation that is expected.  
  

  10. **Waiting Lists:  
  
** Generally speaking, instructors cannot keep waiting lists, since the first
three days  
of classes are open enrollment--first come, first served. After that,
instructors may  
sign students in as they see fit. Certain English classes have waiting lists
maintained  
by Registration.  

  11. **Retaining Student Work:  
  
** Your instructor is free to destroy any student work not picked up during
the first  
week of the quarter immediately after your course was offered. If you want
work  
held longer for pick up, you must make arrangements in advance with your
instructor.  

  12. **Student Responsibility:  
  
** It is the student's responsibility, not the instructor's, to initiate
communication about  
progress or concerns with the course. Instructors are under no obligation to
inform  
students that work is overdue, to nag students to complete assignments, to
call  
students who fail to attend class. Similarly, students need to keep themselves  
informed about syllabus changes that may have been made in class. We suggest  
finding a partner the first week of classes and keeping each other up to date
if  
one is absent.  

  13. **Students With Special Needs:  
  
** Students requiring special accommodations are invited to discuss their
needs  
with their instructor, who may need to consult Disabled Student Services. We  
are committed to making every effort to meet special needs.

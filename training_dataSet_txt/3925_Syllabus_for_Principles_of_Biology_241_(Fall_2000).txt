Grading Policy for Principles of Biology 241 (Fall 2000)
Grades in this class will be determined on a non-competitive basis.  It is possible for every student to earn an "A" grade.
The instructor will add the scores earned on the best four (4) of the five (5) hourly exams (50 x 4 = 200 possible points),  the scores earned on the semifinal and final exams (100 x 2 = 200 points), all of the lecture quiz and other scores (up to 100 points) and the best 10 of the possible laboratory scores (5 points attendence + 5 points performance for each lab) plus the lab final exam (50 points).  The instructor reserves the right to raise or lower the grade of any student up to 25 points based on the student's safety in the lab, class participation, attendence, preparation or effort.    Final grades will be determined by evaluation of the total points earned by each student according to the following schedule of grades.


Students earning 90% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "A".
Students earning 80% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "B".
Students earning 70% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "C".
Students earning 60% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "D".
Students earning less than 60% of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "F".


Because only the best four of the five hourly exams will be counted, there will be no makeup exams in this class.  Because only the scores on the best 10 laboratories will be counted, there will be no makeup laboratories.  All students must take the lab final exam and both the semifinal and final lecture exams to successfully complete this class.  There will be no makeup quizzes or assignments.   The semifinal exam is scheduled for Wednesday the 1st of November at 10:00 a.m. and the final exam will be given Wednesday, 13th of  December from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m.  




Cheating, whether seeking or giving inappropriate assistance during an exam, quiz or other graded assignment will result in a score of "0" for both parties involved.  A second incident will result in a course grade of "F".

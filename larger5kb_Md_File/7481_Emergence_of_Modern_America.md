History 214.301  
Fall 2002  
Tuesday, 2-5  
Syllabus  
The Emergence of Modern America  
Instructor: Michael Katz  
Office: College Hall 215A Phone: 898-3183  
mkatz@ sas  
office hours: Monday 3-5

Topic:  
This seminar focuses on themes in the emergence of industrial society in
America from the early 19th century through the 1930s. The readings and
discussions should provide you with an introduction to major issues, methods,
sources, and interpretations in the study of this topic.

A good seminar requires regular attendance from its members; only illness or
extraordinary circumstances justify absence. Grades will be based half on
written work and half on contributions to the seminar.

The seminar has a Blackboard site where notices of changes and other
information will be posted. Please consult it regularly.

All papers should be submitted through the digital dropbox on Blackboard.
"Hard" copies will not be accepted. Also, please do not send them as
attachments. If you are unfamiliar with Blackboard or its digital dropbox,
please learn how to use them before the first paper is due. Mac users note
that Blackboard will accept only files in Word, with a .doc extension, and
will not accept files in Appleworks.

Assignments:

The six types of assignments in this seminar are: (1) assigned reading; (2)
seminar leadership; (3) serving as rapporteur for a seminar session; (4) short
commentary papers; (5) source reports; (6) possibly a final exercise.

(1) Assigned reading: a seminar is pointless unless the participants have read
the assigned material with care. I expect you to read one book for each week's
discussion. All the books are available in paperback. All will be on reserve
in Van Pelt. They are available for purchase at House of Our Own book store on
Spruce St. I encourage students to share reactions to the readings before the
seminar, questions for discussion, or ideas that occur after class with the
rest of the group through the Blackboard site.

(2) Leadership of a seminar, or seminars. Two students will be assigned to
lead each seminar. They should post questions for discussion on the Blackboard
site at least two days before the seminar. They also should meet with me to
plan the session. The best time is during my Monday office hours. The
discussions should include both specific consideration of the book and the
general questions and issues it raises. For most sessions, there will be
either a discussion of primary sources or a movie of 1/2 to 1 hour.

Here are some ideas for leading the seminar. They are not mutually exclusive.
A very good seminar might well employ all of them. (a) choose some quotations
from the book to be discussed that illustrate major themes or issues
especially well; photocopy these and hand them out at the seminar; use them as
the basis for discussion. Better yet, also post them in advance on the list
server. (b) Find reviews of the book in both academic and, if possible,
publications for a more general audience. Organize some of the discussion
around the critical reaction to the book. (c) Break the seminar up into small
groups; assign each group a task; have the groups choose a spokesperson to
report back to the whole seminar. I strongly encourage the use of "break-out"
groups. Seminar sessions generally should include some small group work.

Two techniques which students often try do not work very well: debates and
role-playing. We can discuss why these seem to fall flat. But be advised to
think of other strategies unless you can think of ways to get around the
common difficulties with these approaches.

(3) Rapporteur: one student will serve as a rapporteur for each session. This
means posting a summary of the major issues discussed on the listserver.

(3) Commentary papers: students should write 6 2-3 page papers commenting on
the week's reading. These should not summarize the book; I assume you all can
do that. Rather, the papers should be a reaction to the book: anything that
strikes you as particularly interesting, important, outrageous, or worth
thinking about. I will keep track of these papers, but they will not be given
formal grades. I expect one paper every other week starting with either the
first or second reading assignment. These papers are due at the end of the
session at which a book is discussed. They are not acceptable later, and they
are an integral part of the seminar. To receive credit for the seminar, you
must turn them in on time.

(4) Source papers: Students will write 3 source papers of 5-7 pages each. Each
paper will be based on a different type of source (specified below). All of
them should: describe the source; assess its strengths, weaknesses, and
utility for the study of history; and discuss some theme raised by it. The
reports should take the form of short essays. These are not major research
papers. I do not expect you to try to write definitively or even very deeply
about any topic. They are exercises to make you think critically and
analytically about different sorts of sources and to assure me that you can
deal with the primary sources of social history. Thus, for example, if you
choose to do a newspaper, you should read only several issues and not try to
cover a year, or even a month. Similarly, if you choose a government or agency
report, read a few of them, and spend your time thinking about them rather
than trying to cover a lot of material. There are ample examples of all the
sources in Van Pelt. Please do not ask me where to find them; that's part of
the exercise. The three types follow. You can do them in any order you choose,
but they are due - and do not ask for an extension - on the following dates:
October 8, October 29, November 26.

(i) Either a newspaper or an official document (e.g. reports of government
agency, such as Board of Education or Department of Welfare).  
(ii) Personal document (e.g. letters, diaries, autobiographies).  
(iii) A statistical source. Not the Historical Statistics of the United
States. I encourage you to do a paper using the University of Minnesota's
IPUMS census data base, which I will explain and illustrate.

(6) Final exercise. If there is a final exercise, it will ask students to
integrate the reading and discussions. The assignment will be distributed at
the last session of the seminar and will be due by 5 p.m. on Monday, December
10.

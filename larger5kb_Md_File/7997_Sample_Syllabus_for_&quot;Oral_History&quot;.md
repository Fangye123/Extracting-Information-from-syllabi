>> **COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
>  History 970 focuses on the methods of taking, processing, and utilizing
oral histories. Interview topics will be selected by each student and the
instructor.  Students will conduct their interviews outside of the normal
class period. They are required to schedule interviews and provide their own
transportation to the interview site.  
>  
>>

>> **COURSE GOALS:**  
>  Students who successfully complete this course will:

>>

>>   * Develop the skills to conduct an oral history interview through
participation in practice interviews, conducting background research,
formulation of narrowly focused but open-ended questions, and critiquing
classmate interviews

>>   * Develop an understanding of the nature of oral history, its importance
and its use in historical research.

**NATURE AND AMOUNT OF STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY: ATTENDANCE & READING
ASSIGNMENTS**  
> The success of this course depends upon the completion of the reading
assignments, regular attendance, and participation in class discussions. If a
student falls behind in his/her readings he/she will soon find it difficult to
follow the subject matter of class discussion or join in it. Moreover, your
interviews form the basis of the YSU Oral History Collection. The success of
the Collection is dependent upon quality interviews developed through class
attendance and participation. Your instructor assumes that you are a mature,
responsible student and therefore, she **expects** to see you in class. Class
attendance  & participation counts as 10% of your final class grade.  
>  
>>

>> **NATURE AND AMOUNT OF INSTRUCTOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES:**  
>  The instructor's goal is to have each class be a mixture of lecture and
discussion. The atmosphere of the class will be kept informal to encourage
general participation and a full variety of viewpoints. The instructor will
make himself available before and after class and during office hours.
Students are encouraged to take advantage of such assistance. If you are
having a problem, do not wait until the night before an assignment is due.
Students should feel free to ask questions about unclear material at any time
during the class. Students also should feel free to talk to the instructor
about any course-related problems.  
>  
>>

>> **BOOK REVIEWS**  
>  To assist in your understanding and comprehension of the assigned books,
each student is required to prepare a book review.  The book review will be a
comparison of two books which extensively use oral history methodology in the
research.  The instructor will provide a list for you to select your books.
The object of a book review is to prepare a written assessment of 3-4 typed
pages (750-1000 words) of the thesis, specific findings, organization, and
documentation of the books assigned. Reviews are due on the assigned dates.
One grade will automatically be deducted from late papers.  
>  
>>

>> **INTERVIEWS**  
>  Each student is required to submit ten interviews.  Students are required
to contact the individual, discuss the class project, secure life history
information, and set up a time, date, and location for the interview.
Interviews, along with all proper documentation, are due on the assigned
dates.  
>  
>>

>> **GRADES:**  
>  Finals grades are computed from three sources, book reviews, class
participation, and oral interviews. Book reviews will be graded on the
strength of the overall review (clarity of writing, development of author's
thesis, main arguments, and specific findings). Class participation is based
on class attendance, active participation in class discussion, and turning
assignments in on time. See attachment for criteria used in evaluating oral
interviews.

>>

>> The course uses the standard 100 point grade scale in which A=90, B=80,
C=70, D=60, and F=59 or below.  Final grades will be computed as follows: |  |
Book Reviews (10% x 2)  | 20%  
>> ---|---  
>> Interviews (10% x 7)  | 70%  
>> Class Participation  | 10%  
>> TOTAL | 100%  
>>  
>> **YOUNGSTOWN STATE UNIVERSITY POLICY ON INCOMPLETES**  
>  The University has instituted a new policy concerning incompletes. Any
incomplete not finished within one year, or upon graduation, will
automatically become an "F" on your permanent transcript.

>>

>> If you need extra help: If you are learning, sensory or physically
disabled, and feel that you require assistance in lectures or assignments,
please let me know during the first week of class. Discussions regarding such
assistance will be held in confidence.

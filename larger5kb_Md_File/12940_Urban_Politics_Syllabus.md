**Urban Politics**



**Course Description**  
Government 3303 addresses issues associated with the governance and politics
of urban America. Readings and course work provide opportunities to learn
about the shape and pattern of local government in the U.S. and why it has
evolved as it has. Special attention will be given to examining how government
structure affects both political participation and policy outcomes. Other
themes running throughout the course include the relationship between public
and private power, the role and impact of race, ethnicity and class, and the
fiscal and legal limitations under which local governments operate.

  
**Requirements**  
The required texts for the course is _City Politics: Private Power and Public
Policy_ by Dennis R. Judd and Todd Swanstrom (Longman Publishers, 1998) and
_Politics of Urban America: A Reader_ (Addison Wesley, 1998). There also will
be reading assignments from handouts distributed in class and from materials
on the web. In addition, you will be expected to stay informed about political
issues in the Houston area by reading the local (metropolitan) news section of
the _Houston Chronicle_ and listening to the local news.

For you to engage in meaningul class discussion, you will need to read and
reflect on the assigned readings prior to class meetings. You are responsible
for all material presented in the assigned readings, regular lectures and in
special presentations by guest lecturers. Regular class attendance is
required.

Grades will be based on two midterm exams, a comprehensive final, and two 4-6
page, typed double-space papers written outside of class. One paper will be a
book analysis written on one of the books on the [POLS 3303
bibliography](Urban_Politics_Bibliography.htm). The second paper will be an
essay camparing the city of Houston to one other large city any place in the
world. Further information on both papers will be given during the semester.
The book analysis is due October 13 and the "Good City" essay is due November
24. Late papers will be penalized one grade.

All grades will be weighted equally in calculating the final course grade. The
following scale will be used in assigning letter grades: 90-100, A; 80-89, B;
70-79, C; 60-69, D, and below 60, F.

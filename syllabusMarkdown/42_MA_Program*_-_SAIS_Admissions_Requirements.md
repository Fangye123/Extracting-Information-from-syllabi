**Objectives**

* * *

The course is designed to introduce students to the evolution of German
society, politics and political economy since 1870, the foundations of
stability of the Federal Republic in the post-war period, and the recent
transformation of German politics and society after German reunification.
Special emphasis will also be given to European engagement in German politics
and the implications of European integration on the national policy making.
The goal is to make students familiar with the current policy issues of a
reunited Germany.  **Objectives** **|Course Requirements | Readings |

**Course Requirements**

* * *

Students are expected to do the readings in a timely manner--that is, in the
week for which they are assigned. Students must also participate actively in
the seminar. Active participation requires attendance, timely reading of the
assigned material and a willingness to speak in class..

**__Response papers__** of 1 page (double spaced) length will be required for
6 of the 12 weeks the course meets. Response papers should address one of the
arguments in the reading (identifying it and responding to it by putting it in
context with the other readings) Response papers are due at the beginning of
class each week.

A seminar participation grade based on class participation and the response
papers will contribute 35% of the course grade.

__**Midterm exam:**__ A take-home midterm exam will be given to all students.
It will cover material from the first half of the course. The exam will be
approximately 8-10 double spaced pages. It will be handed out after class on
Tuesday, March 7, and will be **due in class Tuesday March 14, 2000**. It will
contribute 30% of the course grade.

A __**term essay**__ of 10-15 pages will contribute 35% of the grade. The
essay should be prepared during the course of the semester in consultation
with me. Throughout the semester, students should meet with me to talk about
paper topics, outlines, first drafts, etc. Readings: All readings are on
reserve at the SAIS library. General Readings: these are good reference
materials, and some required readings have been taken from them. Volker

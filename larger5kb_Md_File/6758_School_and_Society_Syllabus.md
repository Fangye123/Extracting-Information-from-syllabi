II. ** _Conceptural Framework_**. This course addresses the following

components of the conceptual framework:

A.                 Philosophical component

B.                 Spiritual component

C.                 Pedagogical component



III.               **_EDU 502. School and Society._** Three semester hours
credit.

**_ _**

IV.              **_Course Identification._** A study of the historical and
contemporary purposes and perspectives of schooling during various eras in our
country from the Jeffersonian

Ideal to the Post-Cold War Era. Attention is given to the historical and
contemporary perspectives of schooling various cultural groups as well as
reform

and professionalization movements. The roles of liberty and literacy, social

diversity, differentiated schooling and cultural contexts of children and
youth are

studied.



V.                 **_Scope._** The course is designed to help prepare
teachers who are able to reflect

critically on their teaching practices in social and institutional contexts.
The scope of the course will cover historical and contemporary analysis of
educational ideas, a focus on diversity - equity in education, reform
movements in education and thinking skills teachers need to think critically
in and about their practice.



VI.              **_Class Attendance._** Class attendance is required for all
class meetings. The

penalty for missing a class meeting will be the lowering of the final grade by
one

letter grade. After the second absence in a Saturday class, the student will
be

dropped from the course. Arriving late or leaving early may result in the
final

grade being lowered.



VII.            **_Students With Disabilities._** Freed-Hardeman University is
committed to

providing equal opportunity in education to qualified students. If you have

a disability that may prevent you from meeting course requirements in how the
course is regularly taught, you should inform the instructor of your
disability. This should be done in the first class session in order that an
Accommodation Plan may be developed. Students will be required to provide
documentation from an acceptable evaluator in order to receive accommodations.
The Director of Disabilities Services will assist with the development of an
Accommodation Plan. Freed-Hardeman University will assist students who have a
documented disability with appropriate accommodations and modifications but
does not guarantee success. Students must cooperate with the University and
must assume responsibility for learning.



VIII.         **_Competencies Expected._**

A.                 The ability to communicate and work effectively with other
professionals

B.                 The ability to communicate and work effectively with
parents

C.                 Understanding of the dignity and worth of students from

knowledge and methods of history and social science disciplines in developing
curriculum appropriate to early childhood and middle grades

I.                    The understanding of the social, economic, political,

IX. **_Course Requirements and Expectations_**



A.                 **Research Paper. ** What are some issues in your local
school system? Class members should identify an issue in their local school
system. Submit the issue to me for approval on **THE DATE STATED ON YOUR
SYLLABUS** Then go to the library, use the web, talk to people involved with
schooling, visit a site where the issue is important, etc. The paper must be
typed, free of errors, have at least 10 different sources, and be at least
**10 pages in length**. The paper is due at the beginning of class **ON THE
DATE SPECIFIED ON YOUR SYLLABUS** and will not be accepted late. Each student
will give a brief oral review of his or her paper. The ten pages are in
addition to a cover page and the bibliography. Each of the ten

sources must be cited in the body of the paper and each source cited in the
paper must be listed in the bibliography. The textbook **_cannot_** __ be one
of the sources. The style manual for writing the paper is the latest edition
of the publication manual of the American Psychological Association (APA).

**(100 points)**

** **

The range of topics that could be covered in this course is nearly infinite.

Even by limiting the range to current issues in each student's local school
system, there is still a staggering number to consider. Anyone who wishes to
enter the work of schooling should have a least some acquaintance with the
most pressing of these issues. This assignment offers a way for class members
to research an issue, to present the results of the research to the rest of
the class, and in turn to be introduced briefly to the issues explored by
others. Refer to the handout " **Research Paper Assessment Outline** " for
issues and additional guidelines.

** **

B.                 **Section Tests. ** There will be three multiple choice
tests based upon

readings from the text. **(300 points)**

** **

**C.                  ****Journal/Interaction/Reflection Articles. ** Each
student will read each of the articles listed under **__Primary Source
Reading__** in chapters **2, 3, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, and 15.** A written
summary/interaction/reflection will be submitted for each. These are to be
only one page. In the upper left corner of the page you are to put your name,
date due, and title of the article. Below that, single-spaced and in a listing
format, you are to give 5 (five) main points presented in the article. After
that, you are to finish the page in single spaces giving your
interaction/reflection to the information presented in the article. Use a size
12 font with one inch margins all around. These will be graded very carefully
for grammar, spelling, and writing errors so that all can improve their
writing skills, as well as interact with the material. The following
information goes in the upper left hand corner of the page. **(64 points)**

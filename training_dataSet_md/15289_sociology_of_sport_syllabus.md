**FINAL EXAMINATION**

* * *

  
**_CONCEPTS:_ Just as a tennis player gains a better grasp of the game by
knowing such concepts as top spin, sliced backhand, flat toss, "love", double
fault and the like,  to appreciate this course you will benefit by learning
these terms _....... Society, culture, group, institution, community,
socialization, stratification, social mobility, ideology, collective behavior,
deviance, conflict, power, rationalization, social organization, race,
minority group, gender, hypothesis, theory, micro and macro sociology,
institutional interdependence, social policy._**  


* * *

**_Research Project:_   Working alone or in groups, students will conduct
original research on some aspect of sport/leisure.**  
**Topics and research techniques will be discussed in class.   Papers will be
8-10 pages long and I will assist you in various**  
**steps of the research process during the semester.**  


**_A SPORTING MODEL OF OUR COURSE:_ I find it useful to think of a sports
analogy in making sense of our course. You are the athlete.   The classes,
readings, Internet sites and group discussions are your practice sessions. The
projects and exams are your "big games" and I am your..... COACH!  In order to
get good grades YOU have to "work on your game".   Don't worry if the "ball
goes into the net" at times (that's the only way to learn tennis);  it's your
overall desire, and practice that makes a good tennis player. Please let me
know how I can help you to make this a successful semester.**

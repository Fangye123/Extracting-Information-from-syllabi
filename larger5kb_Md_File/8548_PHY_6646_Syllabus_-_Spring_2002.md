**Objective:** PHY 6646 is the second of two courses constituting the graduate
core sequence in quantum mechanics. Its aim is to provide a solid grounding in
important applications of nonrelativistic quantum mechanics, including
approximation methods, scattering theory, and many-particle systems.

**Approach:** Like PHY 6645, this course will tend to follow the general order
of topics in Shankar's book, which will be the only required text. However,
extensive supplementary information will be presented about several subjects
(particularly scattering and identical particles). At these points you may
find it particularly useful to consult the optional texts listed above. All
three texts will be on reserve at the Marston Science Library.

**Prerequisites:** It will be assumed that you have successfully completed (1)
at least one year of quantum mechanics at the undergraduate level, and (2) PHY
6645 or equivalent. (The web page
www.phys.ufl.edu/~kevin/teaching/6645/01fall/topics.html summarizes the
content of PHY 6645 as taught in Fall 2001.) If you have any doubt about your
preparation, you should consult the instructor as early as possible in the
semester.

**Homework:** Most weeks you will be assigned a problem set to be turned in
the following week (usually on Friday). You should make a good-faith attempt
to tackle the problems on your own. Some of the problems will be significantly
longer and more challenging than those typically encountered in undergraduate
courses. It is important that you develop the skills to work successfully
through such problems. If you get stuck, however, do not spend an inordinate
amount of time (more than an hour or two) struggling at any one point. Feel
free to discuss your conceptual or technical difficulties with other students
or with the instructor.

Collaboration plays an essential role in science. You are encouraged to work
with other members of the class to understand how to solve the homework
problems, and you are likely to learn more by studying cooperatively. However,
_you must write up the final version of each problem yourself, presenting the
solution in your own words._ (Blind copying of another student's solution is a
form of academic dishonesty.)

Homework solutions should explain your reasoning clearly but concisely, cite
the source of any results given without proof, and be legible and reasonably
neat. Deficiencies in any of these areas may result in point deductions.

The homework will account for 40% of your overall score on PHY 6646. Since it
is very important that you not fall behind in the course, assignments turned
in late will be subject to a 25% penalty. (Each student will receive a waiver
of the 25% penalty for one assignment during the semester.) Each homework set
will be assigned a cut-off point, beyond which no solutions will be accepted
for grading.

**Exams:** There will be three exams: two in-class mid-terms and a two-hour
final. Approximately half of each exam will be closely related to homework.
However, the questions will not merely require memorization and regurgitation
of material covered in lectures and homework. Instead, the emphasis will be on
application of concepts and methods to fairly straightforward problems, some
of which may deal with unfamiliar situations. You may be allowed limited
access to written materials during some of the exams (details will be
announced before each exam), but no collaboration will be permitted.

In the event of a documented conflict with another event, it may be possible
to take an exam shortly before or after its scheduled time. Make-up exams will
be offered only for serious medical conditions or University-approved absences
supported in writing by the appropriate professional. Any request for a
special exam sitting or a make-up must be made a week ahead for any scheduled
absence, and as soon as reasonably possible after an unforeseen absence.

**Academic Honesty:** All University of Florida students are required to abide
by the University's Academic Honesty Guidelines and by the Honor Code, which
reads as follows:  We, the members of the University of Florida community,
pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honesty and
integrity. On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of
Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: " _On my honor, I
have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment._ "

**Accommodations:** Students requesting classroom accommodations must first
register with the Office for Students with Disabilities, located in the Dean
of Students Office, P205 Peabody Hall. The Dean of Students Office will
provide documentation to the student, who must then deliver this documentation
to the instructor when requesting accommodations.

**Grade:** Your grade will be assigned on the basis of an overall score,
derived as follows:  homework  
mid-term 1  
mid-term 2  
final |  40%  
15%  
15%  
30%  
---|---  
There is no rigid point scale or grade curve used to assign letter grades for
the course. You will receive feedback on your likely grade after each mid-term
exam and once more near the end of the semester.

**Topics Covered:** It is anticipated that the course will address the topics
listed below (along with the relevant chapters or sections from the three
texts). However, deviations from this plan are quite likely. A list of topics
actually covered, along with relevant background reading, will be maintained
on the course web pages.

Significant announcements will also be posted on the course Web pages.

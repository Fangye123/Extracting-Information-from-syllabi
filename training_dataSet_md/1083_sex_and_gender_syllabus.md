**_Course Description_**

This course examines the ways in which people in medieval and early modern
Europe (11th to 16th centuries) understood and made meaning out of sexual
practices and the variety of gender constructions they (often but not always)
produced and were produced by. We will compare how medieval people wrote about
sex and gender -- both explicitly, in medical and legal texts, and implicitly,
in religious and popular vernacular texts -- with the ways we understand them
in the modern world.

About the Class Listservs |_**top of page  
The listserv component of the course has several purposes. The most basic one
is to supplement and complement the in class discusssions of course materials
and theoretical issues. The second is to allow for broader discussion of some
of the issues and of more materials than we can cover during class meetings.
The third is to allow you to share the process of your research with your
classmates, and to learn from and help one another in that process. If you are
not familiar with listservs, don't worry about it. We will go over the list in
class, resources to help you are widely available on campus, and your
instructor and fellow students can also help out. Please see the separate page
_Guidelines for Listserv Discussion_ __ for more details.

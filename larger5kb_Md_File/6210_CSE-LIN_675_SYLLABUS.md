####  PREREQUISITE:

The official prerequisite is [CSE
572](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/pub/WWW/grad/courses.html#cse572) or
permission of instructor.

Although knowledge of a programming language will not be required, most
students will either be graduate students in [Computer Science and
Engineering](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/) who have had a graduate-level
introduction to artificial intelligence (similar to CSE 572), or graduate
students in [Linguistics](http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/linguistics/), or
graduate students in any of the other [cognitive
sciences](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/pub/WWW/cogsci/) (such as
[Philosophy](http://philosophy.buffalo.edu/),
[Psychology](http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/psychology/cognitive),
[Communicative Disorders and Sciences](http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/cds/),
[Anthropology](http://wings.buffalo.edu/soc-sci/anthropology/),
[etc.](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/pub/WWW/cogsci/Faculty/faculty.html)) who
feel that their knowledge of either computer science or linguistics is
sufficient for them to participate in the course.

####  COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course will be an introduction to the field of Computational Linguistics.
It is an appropriate sequel to CSE 572, Knowledge-Based Artificial
Intelligence (formerly, Introduction to Artificial Intelligence), or to an
introductory graduate-level linguistics course. Topics to be covered will
include some or all of the following: the nature of natural-language
"competence" (by which I include both understanding _and_ generation), basic
syntactic parsing techniques (including augmented-transition-network grammars
and deterministic parsing), semantic interpretation, and natural-language
generation.

####  COURSE REQUIREMENTS

Class meetings will consist of lectures, general discussion, and discussion of
assigned questions.

Students should notify the instructor within the first two weeks of class if
they have a disability which would make it difficult to carry out course work
as outlined (requiring note-takers, readers, extended test time).

There are two main requirements:

  1. You must _attend_ virtually all classes, _actively participate_ in class discussions, and _turn in all required assignments_ on time. All assignments and their due dates will be announced in class. (Therefore, be sure to get a classmate's phone number (for instance, 1 or 2 people sitting next to you in class, whoever they are!), so that you will not miss assignments in the unlikely event that you miss a class :-) Assignments will be collected and recorded, but not graded; they will serve as a focus for class discussions. **Therefore, no late assignments will be accepted.** There may be some small programming-project assignments; these will be team efforts. 

  2. There will be a _term project_. This will be a 10-15-page, "typed", double-spaced _report_ (which may, but need not, include an appendix detailing a computational implementation). 

The report might be a review of the literature on some topic, a discussion of
some topic not covered fully in class (e.g., connectionist approaches to
computational linguistics, or one of the omitted chapters from the text, or a
discussion of another topic of your choice, or an implementation of one or
more appropriate algorithms from the text, or a team project (such as an
implementation of a "full" natural-language-understanding system, with each
team member being responsible for a module), or a computational implementation
of your choice. If several of you choose to work together on a team project,
your report must include a statement clearly outlining each person's
contribution. The final report for an implementation project must include an
appendix ( _beyond_ the 10-15-page report itself) with _annotated_ sample runs
and the _commented_ program code.

Your topic must be approved by me in advance, and a proposal (perhaps in the
form of an extended summary) of 6-8 "typed", double-spaced pages or--even
better--a first draft must be turned in no later than Monday, March 13\.

The term project is due no later than Thursday, May 4 (= the first day of
final exams). Late projects will be accepted at a full-letter-grade-per-day
discount (e.g., an A project, 1 day late, gets a B, not an A-).

####  READING AND STUDYING:

  1. I strongly urge you to read as much of the text as possible, including those sections that we do not cover in the course.
  2. Not all assigned readings will be covered in lecture (in lecture, we will only cover interesting or hard material, plus occasionally material that is _not_ in the text), but you are responsible for _all_ assigned material in the text, supplementary readings, and lectures.
  3. See ["How to Read (a Computer Science Text)"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtoread.html).
  4. For general advice on how to study for _any_ course, see my web page, ["How to Study"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html). 

####  GRADING:

Class attendance/participation | 25%  
---|---  
Assignments | 25%  
Project | 50%  
**Total** | **100%**  
  
####  Incompletes:

It is University policy that a grade of Incomplete is to be given only when a
small amount of work or a single exam is missed due to circumstances beyond
the student's control, and that student is otherwise doing passing work. I
will follow this policy _strictly_! Thus, you should assume that I will _not_
give incompletes :-) Any incompletes that I might give, in a lapse of judgment
:-), will have to be made up by the end of the Fall 2000 semester. For more
information on Incomplete policies, see the web page,
["Incompletes"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Courses/incompletes.html).

#### ACADEMIC HONESTY:

While it is acceptable to discuss general approaches with your fellow
students, the work you turn in must be your own. _If the work of two or more
students appears unjustifiably similar, penalties (ranging from an F in the
assignment to an F in the course) will be assessed to all concerned._ If you
have any problems doing the homeworks or projects, consult Prof. Rapaport.

Integrity"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Courses/integrity.html)

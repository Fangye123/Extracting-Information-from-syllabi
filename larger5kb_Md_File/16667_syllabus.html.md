Wordsworth and Coleridge  
"Tintern Abbey"  
Questions to think about:

is the function of each section? (Also, note where and how he uses any poetic
devices we've talked about so far (imagery, figurative language, etc.)  
2) All these sections lead up to a "grand statement" at the end. What is W's
argument in the conclusion of this poem?  
3) How does this poem relate to the "Prefaces," specifically, Wordsworth's
stated aim for these poems? How do you see "Tintern Abbey" fitting in with the
other poems in _Lyrical Ballads_?

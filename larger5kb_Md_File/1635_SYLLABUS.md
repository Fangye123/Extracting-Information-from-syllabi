This course offers a survey of the art produced in Europe from the middle to
the end of the 19th century.   While the series of lectures will follow the
traditional "canon" of Great Masters from Courbet to Toulouse-Lautrec, this
will be presented as a changing historical construction rather than an
absolute truth.  In other words we will explore the reasons behind the
critical and mythic stature of particular artists rather than merely accepting
this status as a given.   Particular attention will be paid to the
construction of myths such as the "spontaneity of Monet"; the "madness" of Van
Gogh; the "primitivism" of Gauguin; etc.  
    
We will analyze the achievements of these artists both in the context of a
modernist history of art which focuses on technical advancements and formal
innovation, and in the context of the modern world in which they were
produced.  Cultural production will be studied in relation to the stratified
economic and cultural class structure of Europe, the prevalent ideas on race
and gender, and the growth of the modern city.  Our major locus will be the
city of Paris as it dominated European culture during this period.

**Requirements**  
Regular class attendance is mandatory; more than three classes missed will
result in a lowered grade.  While this is a lecture course, there will be some
class discussion and participation will count for a percentage of the grade.
There will be two trips to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and one to the Rodin
Museum.  Each trip will have two possible time slots to ensure that everyone
can attend.

There will be two exams, a mid-term and final, and two papers.  The first will
be a formal comparison of two works from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, 4-5
pages in length.  The second will be an 8-10 page research paper focusing on
an issue or artist of your choice.  A paper will be marked down a half grade
for each day it is late.  Plagiarism will result in a failing grade.

Participation 10%, Comparison Paper 20%, Mid-term 20%, Research Paper 25%,
Final Exam 25%

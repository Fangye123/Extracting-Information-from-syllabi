**This course surveys the major developments in the tradition of political
theory from the Medieval vision of the great chain of being to the postmodern
celebration of the absurd.   In this course we witness the decline of the
Christian worldview as the ordering principle for political society in Europe.
In the 17th and 18th centuries, the centuries of the Social Contract, the
major concepts of political modernity (natural rights, popular sovereignty,
constitutionalism, civil society, revolution, etc.) emerged.  In the
literature of the 19th century we encounter the thoroughly secular nature of
contemporary political thought in which the issue of God or transcendence does
not even have to be engaged.  With Nietzche (and with contemporary postmortem
thought) we see the unraveling of dignity and respect.  Finally, with Freud,
the irrationality of political life is given a scientific description.** ****

**I have three goals for the class this semester: 1) to develop a nuanced
understanding of texts and their interpretation, 2) to illuminate the basic
assumptions of modernity, and 3) to critically reflect on the political
problematic which modernity poses for the Church.**  
** ** ****

**             Texts: Machiavelli, Selected Political Writings (David Wootton,

****  ****

**Assignments: The course grade will be determined on the basis of the
production of a major research paper (40%) as well as the presentation of that
paper in a panel format (20%).   The final exam (40%) is scheduled for
Wednesday, May 6 at 8:00 a.m.** ****

**  A note on paper and panel presentations: In the academy research is both
produced and publicly delivered.  You will have an opportunity to "do
political theory" this semester in the following ways: 1) by attending the
Midwest Political Association Annual Meeting in Chicago on Thursday, April 23.
At the conference you will observe at least one theory panel of paper
presentations and discussions.  You will also be free to collect papers
(usually about $1 each) and attend the book fair in which you can purchase new
books at great savings.  Please set aside this date and plan to attend.  More
details will be forthcoming as to travel and meal arrangements. 2) You will do
your own research on a topic covered in the course material.  This paper will
be 15-20 pages in length and fully documented. 3) You will present this paper
as a part of a panel in which similar topics are being addressed, and in which
you will act as both presenter (of your own paper) and discussant (of the
others).  Again, more details will be made available as we come closer to the
time but for now here are some dates for you to keep in mind:** ****

**Wednesday, January 21    Panels Provided**  
**Monday, January 26    Topic Chosen/Panels Formed**  
**Thursday, February 19    Prospectus Due**  
**Monday, March 16     Rough Drafts Due**  
**Thursday, April 16 Papers completed & distributed (to panel members &
chair)**  
**Thursday, April 23    Midwest Political Science Mtg.**  
**April 24 - May I PANEL PRESENTATIONS** ****

**a note on the panels: In good professional fashion, the chair will begin
each panel with a very brief introduction.   Then each presenter will have 5
minutes to present his/her research.  Each discussant will have 3 minutes for
response.  There will then be open time for questions and discussion.** ****

**Research Paper Guidelines & Tips** ****

**As you begin to research the topic that will become your research paper for
this course, let me set out some guidelines and proffer a few tips which I
hope will aid you in your efforts.** ****

**Guidelines:** ****

**      1\. The paper length ought to be in the 15-20 page range.  In
scholarly fashion it should be typed, double-spaced, a readable font [not less
than 101, paginated and include notation [embedded, endnoted, or footnoted are
each acceptable] and a complete bibliography.** ****

**      2\. The sources for the paper should be the latest works in the area
of your research.  While occasional classics and earlier articles or books may
be necessary for your paper, the research should rest as much as possible on
work done since 1990.  I expect the body of your text and your bibliography to
include 7 sources (books and/or articles), again with the bulk of these being
published in the '90s.** ****

**      3\. *By 5:00 p.m., Thursday, February 10th, you should turn into me a
2-3 page prospectus of your research paper.  This prospectus should include:
1) a title, 2) a 2-paragraph summary of what you intend to do in the paper,
and 3) a preliminary, but briefly, annotated bibliographic listing of
sources.**  
** **  
**      4\. *The week of February 23-27, please sign up for a 15-30 minute
consultation with me about your prospectus and the development of your
paper.** ****

**      5\. Rough draft of the paper is due Monday, March 16.  By rough I mean
more than a skeleton, but less than a full-dressed product.  The more you have
by that date, the less you'll have to do by...** ****

**     6\. Thursday, April 16 the final papers are due.  A final 2-pa-e
abstract should be distributed to all non-panel members of the**  
** **  
**class.   The full paper should be distributed to all panel members and to
me.** ****

**Tips:**  
****  ****

**        1\. Think of a research paper as an exercise of intellectual
discovery in which you embark upon a journey of unknown**  
**dimensions and conclusions.   As you sort through the data, you begin to
construct a map of the world you're exploring Your conclusion will be an
assessment of that world.  You might even want to indicate paths which future
scholarly endeavors might want to explore.** ****

**       2\. Proofread uber alles!  Do not submit a paper you cannot be proud
of.  Write and re-write. (Sometimes I have re-written an article 7 times prior
to its final submission for publication.  But the more I re-write the less the
editor has to, thus the happier the editor is with my work.) Mistakes on final
drafts will be punished severely!  More than one, and the paper cannot obtain
an "A" (and so on from there).** ****

**      3\. Consult each other!  Consult the papers I have placed on reserve.
If you want more positive examples, come to my office and I can let you see
some.  Negative examples I have not.  They have been cast into the outer
darkness.** ****

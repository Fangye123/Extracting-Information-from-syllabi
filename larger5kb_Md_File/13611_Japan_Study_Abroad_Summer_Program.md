      The Summer Field Seminar is built around 2 courses whose purpose is to study for 5 to 6 weeks the geography of Japan.  The trip is designed to cover various regions of Japan, examining physical and cultural differences and likenesses from such well-known areas as Tokyo.  3+ weeks of the trip will be held on the campus of IEC Technical College in Yatsushiro (near Nagasaki), [Kyushu](http://www.kyushu.meti.go.jp/invest/quick/quick.htm), and 2 weeks will be spent using the rail system to travel between Hokkaido and Kyushu.  The field seminar provides a unique opportunity for students to conduct field studies and research on a variety of critical issues facing Japan's environment, culture and economy.  Students participating in the Summer Field Seminar Program will register in two University of Kentucky or University of Wisconsin-Platteville three-credit courses.  

     Under faculty guidance each student will carry out a _field-based_ research project from a variety of topics such as urban development, agricultural problems, migration, high-tech industries, environmental problems and natural hazards.   Each student carries out a field-based research project culminating in a final written report. Students in the past have selected topics from fields such as urban development, land-use policy, migration, high-tech industries, environmental problems, westernization, impacts of automobiles, and natural hazards.  Students will have the rest of the summer to complete the requirements for  the courses.

     Beginning the summer of 2001, we added 3 weeks of Japanese language instruction in _Yatsushiro_ , which will be taught by Japanese faculty of IEC, as part of one 3-credit course.

     The cost of the 2003 Summer Field Seminar in Japan will be $3500 which includes round trip air fare to Japan, housing and program-related field trips, and the 14-day rail tour of Japan including hotels and rail passes.

 The following is the text required for this course.  It is available in the
bookstore.

     Anson, Miller, Bilsky, Hanson. _A Brief History of Civilization_   
    
     Optional:  _A Civilization Primer_ (4th edition) (for individuals with limited background   
                       in the social sciences)   
                      _Hammond's Historical Atlas_ (3rd edition)   
    

Examinations:

1.  Brief Papers: Each student should submit 15 one-page typed (or equivalent length in clear long hand) answering one of the questions that follow the reading selections in the text or the single question that accompanies each of the map exercises (Note that the map questions have multiple parts, each of which must be answered).  Answers to the questions must be based on the material in the reading, not on the introduction to the reading, nor the textbook narrative, nor on outside sources.  Moreover, all statements of fact based on the reading need to be referenced in the paper.  This can be done simply by listing a page reference (i. e. p. 107) or the source's own internal numbering system (i. e. Ham. 208; Gen 8:15) after the statement in question.  No formal footnotes are needed.  Students are expected to do their own papers; no group efforts.  Papers must be handed in either before or on their due date; no late papers will be accepted.  Papers, however, may be mailed in (postmark date must be on or before the due date), or e-mailed to me on or before the due date (not faxed). 

2.  Midterm and Final: There will be a midterm and a final examination.  The midterm and the final will consist of a first section devoted to identifications about which the student will write a brief paragraph.  There will be some choice among these identifications.  The second portion of the exam will be devoted to one or more essay questions.  A group of potential essay questions for the midterm is attached to this syllabus; the essay questions for the midterm will be drawn from these.  Students are encouraged to think about these questions as soon as the material relating to specific questions has been covered. Students may turn in practice essays, thesis statements, outlines of possible answers to essays, in advance of the exam.  These will be handed back to the students with written comments; no grade will be recorded.  Final exam questions are also attached.  The final will be cumulative. 

Class Attendance: Class attendance is required; the student is held
responsible for all reading assignments and for all material covered and
announcements made in class.  Everyone is expected to be present at the time
class starts and remain until it is dismissed.  If for great and good cause
you are either late or have to leave early, please enter or leave quietly and
as inconspicuously as possible, i. e. do not walk across the front of the
room.

Make-up Exams:  There will be no make-up midterms or  papers.  Each student's
five lowest paper grades will be dropped before the final computation of
grades.  If the midterm exam is missed the midterm component of your final
grade will be added to that of the final (the final will then be worth 50% of
the final grade).  No incompletes will be given unless approved by me prior to
December 16, 1999.  Moreover, incompletes will only be given when
circumstances beyond the control of the student prevent the student from
completing part of the course requirements.  Incompletes cannot be given for
the entire semester's work.  Moreover, all completed work counts; an
incomplete is not a substitute for a failing grade.  Finally, History 1311
cannot be taken on a credit/no credit basis, or pass/fail basis.

General Regulation:  Final grades will be computed on the following basis:

 50% for brief papers (five lowest paper grades will be dropped)  
 20% for the midterm (will be dropped if student scores higher on final; 20%
then added to weight  of final)  
 30%(or 50% if midterm dropped or missed) for the final

  
DISABILITY SUPPORT SERVICES - It is the policy of UALR to accommodate students
with disabilities, pursuant to federal law, state law, and the University's
commitment to equal educational opportunities.  Any student with a disability
who needs accommodation, for example in seating placement or in arrangements
for examinations, should inform the instructor at the beginning of the course.
The Chair of the Department offering this course is also available to assist
with accommodations.  Students with disabilities are also encouraged to
contact the Office  
of Disability Support Services, which is located in the Donaghey Student
Union, Room 105, telephone 569-3143.

CHEATING - No student may gain undue advantage over his/her classmates by
deceptive or dishonest means (as defined in "Cheating", Student Handbook, p.
30).  Anyone who engages in such activity will receive an "F" in the course
and will be turned over to the Academic Integrity and Grievance Committee for
University disciplinary action.

 GRADING QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS - Students with questions or complaints
about the grading of their papers or exams should write out what the problem
is and hand it in after class.  This is the forum in which such matters are to
be handled, not during class, nor during office hours.  
    


All grade computations are on the following basis:  
  90-100% = A | 70-79% = C  
---|---  
80-89% = B | 60-69% = D  
80-89% = B | 0-59% = F  
*(Papers turned in the first time and earning a grade below 70% must be redone)*

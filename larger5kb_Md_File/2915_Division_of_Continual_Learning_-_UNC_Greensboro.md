**The Anthropologist on Mars  
** Reading, Writing and Observing from the Outsider/Insider Perspectives  
MLS 610A-81

As we approach the films, essays, and novels in this course, we'll adopt the
ethnographic position of Oliver Sacks who suggests that he often feels like
"an anthropologist on Mars" as he approaches his patients' fascinating
neurological differences. In addition to Sack's wonderful essay collection,
we'll read novels that ask us to adopt an outsider approach to very different
cultures: Zora Neale Hurston's Mules and Men, Allison Lurie's Imaginary
Friends and Elenore Bowen's Return to Laughter. In addition, we will watch
some really wonderful films about interesting subcultures: Strictly Ballroom
and Unzipped, among the many. And we'll do a paper about a subculture that
intrigues us.

Tuesdays and Thursdays 5:45 - 9:30 PM

May 22 \- June 21 Airport Marriott

Dr. Elizabeth Chiseri-Strater, who teaches rhetoric and composition in the
Department of English, will lead the course.



******East West Cinema  
** MLS 610B-81

This course examines the relationship between Eastern and Western cinema
through a comparative study of genres. MLS 610B East West Cinema will examine
detective, western, and off-beat gangster genres through a comparison of films
such as Chan is Missing, Chinatown, The Wild Bunch, The Seven Samurai,
Breathless, and Chung King Express. Supplemental readings on the individual
directors and cultural aspects that reflect on the films will be included.
Required for the course will be readings, quizzes, and an oral presentation of
a scene from a selected film, short focused responses, and a final paper. The
course was designed and offered when Professor Tony Fragola of the department
of Broadcasting/Cinema was Visiting Scholar at Hong Kong Baptist University
and reflects his fascination with different perspectives on the East and West
as revealed through films.

Mondays and Wednesdays 5:45 - 9:30 PM

May 21 \- June 20 Dudley Conference Center, Kernersville

Tony Fragola is Professor and Acting Head of Broadcasting/Cinema. He is co-
author of a book The Erotic Dream Machine: Interviews with Alain Robbe-Grillet
on His films. He has written and directed short films and published scholarly
articles on European directors.



******Simple Living in a Complex Age  
** MLS 620A-81

With all our wealth, we want more. With all our timesaving devices, we rush
around. With all our freedom, we feel trapped. That, at least, is how it
seems.

Many want to simplify their lives. But what does this mean - living bare
bones, adopting a hair shirt, and eating straw?

During this course we will examine four models for living simply: self-
restraint, self-fulfillment, mindfulness, and complexity (yes, complexity is a
way to simplicity!). Each has its proponents, yet each can support the other,
and none require heroic efforts. But they do ask that we thoughtfully examine
the basic assumptions and values of our society and ourselves (no mean feat)
and be willing to make changes. You'll be asked to read, examine, discuss and
write in what is usually a very exciting course in applied ethics.

Mondays and Wednesdays 5:45- 9:30 PM

Additional class meeting June 2 9:00 AM - 12 noon

May 21 \- Jun 18 Riverbirch Retreat, Summerfield, NC (20 minutes from Winston-
Salem, 20-25 minutes from Greensboro)

Dr. Charlie Headington (PhD, University of Chicago) teaches a variety of
courses at UNCG and in the community. Most of them encourage people to examine
themselves and society, and make constructive changes in how they think and
live. He likes to garden, walk, cook, daydream, be with his family, and learn
Italian.



******The Dialectics of Change: Self and Social Transformation  
** MLS 620B-91

To live in these postmodern times is to experience powerful but conflicting
emotions. On the one hand we experience a world that is ever more powerful and
insidious in its ability to shape our innermost desires and dreams. The
postmodern world is one in which the consumer culture, to an unprecedented
degree, organizes our wants, needs and yearnings. The extraordinary
proliferation of material goods and technologies promise us lives rich with
excitement, stimulation and opportunity. Yet it is a world that comes at a
steep price: increasing hours at work, intensifying pressures to produce, and
a seemingly limitless quest for more, better, and faster things. It is also a
world that encourages the possibility of human change. Our time is one in
which we are urged to throw away the baggage of our past, to shed the
limitations of existing identity, and to make ourselves anew. As never before
human beings are expected to make choices about everything from sexual
identity to religious beliefs, the nature of our family and intimate lives,
physical wellbeing and wholeness, even the philosophies of meaning and moral
belief that guide our everyday existence.

Drawing on recent texts that speak to these increasingly important this course
will explore some of the key issues that comforts us both existentially and
culturally. These include the relationship between spiritual meaning and the
everyday world, of work and material life, the quest for wholeness in a
context of increasingly social fragmentation, the search for love in a time of
increasing competitiveness, and the wish for blessing and plenitude in a world
of intensifying greed and dissatisfaction. This course will offer the
opportunity for both self-reflection and cultural criticism as we move from
the inner dimensions of human change to the external meaning of cultural
criticism.

For those struggling with both questions of possibility and acceptance, this
class will provide a rich, if sometimes unsettling, opportunity to examine
their own experience, and to learn from others grappling with the meaning of
change in their lives. Led by Dr. Sherry Shapiro, whose research and teaching
focus on the impact of cultural and personal change on the body. Texts include
all about love by bell hooks; My Grandfather's Blessings, by Rachel Remen; and
the Art of Happiness by Dalai Lama.

Mondays and Wednesdays 5:45 - 9:30; Saturdays 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM

June 25 \- July 16 PT Cam Building, 2105 Yanceyville St. Greensboro

******The Nature of Culture  
** MLS 620C-91

Students in this course will be introduced to the concept of culture,
emphasizing the diversity of human experience and variation in human
formations \- from language to kinship, and social order to global capitalism.
Emphasis will be placed on studying contemporary cultures including Japan, New
Zealand, Sweden, Finland, and Canada with an eye to cultivating a fundamental
capacity for understanding unfamiliar and familiar human cultures, and an
ability to interpret "difference" in cultural context. Seminar activities will
generate thought about how culture influences human behavior, about complex
issues of identity and how to bridge differences to achieve more effective
societal harmony. It is hoped that students will appreciate the wide array of
differences that have developed throughout the world and gain new insights
into the patterns and dynamics of their own traditions. Required work includes
a series of class activities) graded p/NP) and a fieldwork paper (10-15pp) on
a specific group and using a "life history" (biographical approach).

Tuesdays and Thursdays 5:45 - 9:30 PM

******Discovering Animal Societies  
** MLS 630B-91

To participate in this course, it is strongly recommended that students have
access to the following system set-up: either a Pentium-class personal
computer running Windows 95 or Windows 98; or a Macintosh 68040 or Power
Macintosh running System 7.5 or later. In addition, students should have

Why do males fight more than females - or do they? Why are males so often
larger or brighter than females - or are they? Is there really any such thing
as monogamy? If so, why is it so common in birds? Do birds think? How does the
process of evolution shape the unique behavior of animals of different
species? These and other related questions will be the focus of MLS 630
Discovering Animal Societies, an online course that presents an evolutionary
and ecological analysis of the wonders of animal social life. Focusing on
topics such as courtship, aggression, communication, altruism, parenting, and
animal cognition, we will examine the processes that enable wild animals to
behave in ways that meet the demands of their natural environments and that
often place them in direct conflict with one another.

This course will be offered in the course management system Blackboard.
However, a text version of the syllabus is available online for you to view.

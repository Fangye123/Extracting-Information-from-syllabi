**I. Course Description**

This course is designed to explore the intersections of gender, race,
sexuality, science, and technology. We will explore the cultural studies of
science including the historical, philosophical, sociological, anthropological
and literary studies of science. What is science? How does our culture
evaluate "good" and "bad" science, "basic" research and "useful" research? Who
determines these? Who gets to practice science? How does the institution of
science function? How is science related to the larger political, cultural and
social contexts? We will examine how science has grown to be the center of our
cultural visions and imaginations and what that means for our futures.

**II. Requirements**

_Class Participation_ : The quality of the course, and the value of the
experience for all of us, depends upon careful preparation for class by each
one of us. It is imperative that you attend all classes, complete the reading
assignments before class, and be prepared to contribute to the class
discussion. Your grade will be based on the quality (not to be confused with
quantity) of your participation in class throughout the quarter. (Twenty
percent of your grade). Attendance is required. More than three unexcused
absences will result in a reduction of at least one letter grade.

_Leading a Class discussion_ : Each student will lead the class discussion
once during the quarter. During this session, the student will present
additional materials than those assigned in the schedule of readings. Students
will prepare discussion questions and additional readings in consultation with
the instructor. (Ten percent of your grade)

_Written Requirements_ : There will be four written assignments. Content and
form of the essays will be discussed in class.

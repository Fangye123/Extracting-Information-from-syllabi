Democracy in America and Europe: An Intellectual History

This course will introduce students to the history of democracy in America and
Europe. The idea of democracy, which currently commands almost universal
approba-tion, was reviled as mob rule for most of Western history. We will
seek to explain that transforma-tion by examining the history of democracy in
theory and prac-tice. Re-quired readings in various primary sources will be
supple-mented by a text, Mark Kishlansky et al., Civilization in the West
(designated CW below). In addition to the required books available at the
Coop, all students will be required to purchase a sourcebook. Selections in
the sourcebook are indicated by an asterisk below. All students will be re-
quired to attend two lectures and participate actively in one discussion
section each week (20% of your grade), write three short papers (10%, 15%, and
20% of your grade, respectively), and com-plete mid-term (10%) and final (25%)
examinations. The grades of late papers will be lowered for each day they are
late (e.g., a grade of B becomes a B- if the paper is one day late, a C+ if
two days late, etc.). There will be no exceptions to this policy for any
reason. The first paper (3-5 pages) is due Tuesday, February 26; the second
paper (4-6 pages) is due Tuesday, March 14; the third paper (5-7 pages) is due
Monday, May 6.  
The lectures and readings are intended to complement rather than substitute
for each other. The textbook provides an outline of political and socio-
economic developments; unless you are very familiar with modern history, you
should read Kishlansky in order to obtain a framework for under-standing the
lectures and the other readings. The lectures will offer interpreta-tions of
develop-ments in the theory and practice of democracy as well as reflec-tions
on the similari-ties and differenc-es between European and American thought
and experience. In your discus-sions, essays, and exams, you will have the
oppor-tunity to synthesize information and ideas presented in the readings and
lectures to help you learn how to examine critically and creatively the work
of a number of major thinkers.  
The papers will involve critical analysis of ideas presented in the as-signed
readings, which will be discussed in lectures and in section meetings each
week between the Thursday and Tuesday lectures at times to be arranged.
Discus-sion questions and essay topics will be distributed in advance. My
office hours are Tuesdays 2:15-4:00, Thursdays, 2:15-4:00, or by appoint-ment.
Finally, if you are a student with a documented disability, please see the
head teaching fellow, Anthony Smith, immediately.

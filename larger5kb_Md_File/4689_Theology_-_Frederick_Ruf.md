Existentialism and Religion  
Theology 181; TR 1:15-2:30  
Spring 2000 Professor Ruf **Syllabns**

       An examination of existentialism as an orientation that provides meaning for human beings in particularly _disorienting_ terms, particularly with regard to anxiety, meaninglessness, alienation, and finitude. The spring 2000 course will focus on the existential imagining of the self, most centrally by a thorough reading of Friedrich Nietzsche's _The Gay Science_. Jean Paul Sartre's _Nausea_ will provide us with a literary exemplar of the existential imagining of the self. We will then look at post-existential and postmodern ways of imagining the self with strong roots in the disorientations of existentialism. We will read selections of Alien Ginsburg's poetry, view at least one film, and read the "secular theology" of one of the most important contemporary thinkers, Charles Winquist. 

**_Books:_**

Friedrich Nietzsche, _The Gay Science_ (Random House, 1974)*  
Michel Foucault, 'Nietzsche, Genealogy, History," (from Language, counter-
memory, Practice, 1977, pp.139- 164)  
Jean Paul Sartre, _Nausea_ (New Directions, 1975)*  
Charles Winquist, _Desiring Theology_ (Chicago, 1995)*  
Alien Ginsberg, Howl and Other Poems (City Lights, 1991)

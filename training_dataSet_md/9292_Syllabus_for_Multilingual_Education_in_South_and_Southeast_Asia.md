This course focuses on bi- and multilingual education systems in South and
Southeast Asia, with particular emphasis on the role of English in those
systems. For Southeast Asia, therefore, the focus is on former British
colonies where English still plays a significant role in the educational
system, such as in **Singapore** (and to a lesser extent, Malaysia). In
Indonesia, where 80% of the population are mother-tongue speakers of languages
other than Bahasa Indonesia, the focus will be on the role of Bahasa Indonesia
as L2 in this system. For South Asia, the focus will be on the `conflict'
between English and other languages, such as Hindi, Urdu, or Sinhala.
Attention will be paid to the history of education in the area, educational
policy, language policy, indigenous types of multilingualism and indigenous
models of multilingual education, proficiency assessment, and the measurement
of educational outcomes.

## Writing Assignments and Other Tasks

Students will be expected to do two projects: a short writing assignment and a
long writing project concerned with a topic related to multilingual education
in South/Southeast Asia.

    * For the **longer** project, a 10-15 page paper on some aspect of the material covered in the course is required. This assignment will be due in stages, the final product due the last week of class. (To understand the requirements for this writing project, see Helpful Hints.) 

    * The _smaller_ assignment will involve interviewing a native speaker of a South/Southeast Asian language, focusing on the person's **multilingualism** and hsr. **multilingual educational experience** . The results will be presented in class, with a short write-up to be handed in. For some background on what is meant by repertoires and bilingualism in the South/Southeast Asian context, see Schiffman _LCLP_ Chap. 2., or look at this URL on the subject of  register and repertoire. 

## Deadlines

There will be **DEADLINES** for these various projects, and schedules to be
adhered to.

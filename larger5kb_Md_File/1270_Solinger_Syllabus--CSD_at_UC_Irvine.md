`**The State in Comparative Perspective**`

`**Content and Goals**`

` This is a seminar course examining the nature and practice of "the state"
from a wide variety of angles. The class sessions divide into three sections:
the first section, covering weeks 1 through 3, will be largely theoretical. It
will grapple with the development of the state in historical times, beginning
with the earliest forms of the state; then will consider a range of theories
concerning the nature and definition(s) of "the" state; and lastly will
examine theoretical issues related to two major forms of states--the
capitalist/democratic and the socialist/communist states. That section will
also consider some of the issues in the transition from socialism.  
`

`_In addition, there is a coursepack that can be purchased on the first day of
class._ (It contains over 50 readings, and will save you lots of trouble going
to the library and trying to share library materials.)`

`**Requirements and Evaluation**`

` There will be three components to your grade:`

`_1. Class Participation_`

` Each student will be required to attend class _and to come to class having
done the reading assignments._ By 11:00 a.m. on the day of each class,
students must send by email 3 thought-provoking questions or comparative
statements both to me and to the student(s) in charge of that day's session.
Each question or statement must bring together similar or related points
raised by _at least two_ of the authors for that day. In addition, your
questions as a whole should show that you have done _most of the assigned
readings_ for that day. The questions posed must be rich and interesting
enough to serve as the basis for class discussion. A number of these will be
selected prior to class for our consideration. Your questions, combined with
your oral class participation, will account for one-quarter of your grade. _If
you must miss a class, you still are responsible for turning in the set of
questions either on the day of class or (after informing the instructor of the
reason for your tardiness) within the next day or two._ Otherwise, your grade
may be influenced.  
`

`_2. Short Papers_`

` Each student must submit 2 analytical problem papers, each one typed and
about 10-12 pages in length. Each of these papers is worth another quarter of
your total grade. There must be _one on any 2 of the 3 sections_ of the
course. You may write on _any one of the 3 or 4 subjects_ within each section.
The object is to choose _one critical issue_ or _problem_ or _question_ you
have identified in the reading for that week and analyze and compare the way
the different authors in that group of readings have discussed that issue.
Ideally, you should structure your material around _an argument_ that you have
constructed using the readings. Your paper should show that you have done the
bulk of the reading for that week, and should be footnoted. There is no need
to read anything outside the assigned readings. Papers are due _at the start
of class_ for that day. _NO LATE PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED._  
`

`_3. Presentation_`

` Each student will present and guide the class for one session. The
presentation will entail raising themes that appear in or tie together the
readings for that session. In addition, you will need to incorporate (and call
on other students to help deal with) the questions that the other students
have posed in writing for that session. Your presentation will be evaluated on
the basis of the level of preparation exhibited in your guidance of the class
and on how skillfully you present the ideas in the readings.`

`_There is no midterm, final exam, or research paper required._`

**CSE 5311 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms**  
Telecampus Section

  

#  Description

In this class we will cover a number of ideas and techniques useful for
designing and analyzing data structures and algorithms. In particular, we will
introduce techniques for analyzing upper bounds for algorithms and lower
bounds for problems. Problem areas include sorting, graphs, dynamic
programming, combinatorial algorithms, computational geometry, encryption,
parallel models, and NP-Completeness.

#  Prerequisites

The prerequisites for this class are Data Structures (CSE 2320) and
Theoretical Concepts in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE 3315). Please
contact the CSE graduate advisor, Dr. Yerraballi (ramesh@cse.uta.edu), if you
have questions about the prerequisites or your technical background.

#  Textbook

The textbook for this class is Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein,
_Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition_ , MIT Press, 2001. This book can
be purchased directly from the publisher at [

#  Instructor Information

The instructor for this online class is Diane Cook. She can be reached by
email at cook@cse.uta.edu or by phone at (817) 272-3606. The TAs for this
class are Pratyush Mishra (cse5311@cse) and Nikhil Chakravarthi
(chakrava@cse). Pratyush will be grading the first three quizzes and the first
program, and Nikhil will be grading the rest of the quizzes and programs.
Pratyush and Nikhil will hold office hours on Thursdays from 5 to 7. Please
contact them if you have any questions. If you need to physically meet with
somebody on campus, please set up an appointment with myself or one of the
TAs.

Diane Cook is a Professor in the Department of Computer Science and
Engineering at the University of Texas at Arlington. Dr. Cook received her
B.S. from Wheaton College in 1985, and her M.S. and Ph.D. from the University
of Illinois in 1987 and 1990, respectively. Dr. Cook's research interests
include artificial intelligence, machine planning, machine learning, data
mining, robotics, and parallel algorithms for artificial intelligence.

#  Grades

The grade distribution for this class is shown below. With the first quiz you
will be asked to provide a pseudonym consisting of six letters and/or digits.
This pseudonym can be used throughout the remainder of the semester to verify
your scores and compare your weighted semester total with the class average.

Grading: | 8 | Quizzes | 70%  
---|---|---|---  
  | 3 | Programs | 30%  
  
#  Course Details

  1. Assigned readings are from the course textbook and should be completed by the dates listed on the schedule. You should read the introductory material at the beginning of each chapter whose sections are referred to in the assigned readings. With the new edition of the book there may be some differences between the content in the book and the content on line. You are responsible for all materials presented in the on line lecture notes. 

  2. There will be eight 30 minute closed book quizzes throughout the semester. Quizzes cover primarily the material introduced since the previous quiz, but may reference earlier material. Quizzes are tentatively scheduled for Tuesdays or Thursdays at 4:00, but may be moved based on the needs of the majority of the class. The quiz room will be announced before the first quiz. All students who live within one hour of campus must take quizzes on campus. Those students who live more than an hour from campus may contact Dr. Cook about alternative methods of taking the quizzes. 

  3. All work in this class must be done individually. If you use material found on the web, reference any and all material you use. Anyone cheating on work in this class will receive a failing grade for the work and will be subject to the university's academic dishonesty policy. Cheating involves giving assistance or receiving assistance on work assigned in this class. If you have any questions regarding an assignment or a quiz, see the instructor or teaching assistant. 

  4. Make sure you have an account on omega (omega.uta.edu), the computer offered by ACS. This is the machine on which all programs will be implemented. Programs can be written in any language but must be able to be compiled and run on omega. Programs should be submitted by email to the TA. To obtain an account on Omega or ask questions about machine usage, please fill out the online form found at [ http://www2.uta.edu/userserv/actstud.htm](http://www2.uta.edu/userserv/actstud.htm). 

If you encounter difficulties using this machine or have questions, send email
to suggest@uta.edu or call ACS directly at (817) 272-2208.

> >  
>  Pragmatism is an American Philosophical tradition founded by C.S. Peirce,
and developed especially by William James, John Dewey, and George Herbert
Mead. The major idea from Peirce is that ideas exist actually in the practice
and doing, rather than as some derivation from language, logic, the mind, or
texts.

>>

>>  
>  This tradition is now receiving deserved attention after decades of
neglect. This is occurring in a political-economic, and intellectual era which
replays much of the monopolization and development. We will explore what
happened during that time, and question the reemergence and recurrency of
Pragmatism in this time.  
>  This is the year of publication of Louis Menand's,  "The Metaphysical
Club," which will be the central text for this course. We'll read chapter each
week (conveniently it has 15 chapters plus an epilogue). The book is written
almost as a novel, and is a very good read: an almost novel about philosophy!
It has been on the NYT Best Seller list: a must-read.

>>

>> So the major subject matter will become clear as we read and discuss this
book.  
>  But there is more: a shadow course which takes the ideas of the
pragmatists, and attempts to extend them to the present. Whether we read much
more depends on the students in the class. But I intend to discuss some amount
of the ideas of John Dewey and George Herbert Mead who are more my mentors
than some others. How the parallel era might be playing out in this moment,
and how to develop a next progressive-pragmatism. Dewey, particularly pushed
the idea of the necessity of our participation in the world to shape it
democratically.

>>

>> This shadow course develops the ideas, particularly, of Peirce, Dewey, and
G.H. Mead who developed a critique of human nature and of the line of Western
thinking which has developed by focusing on the individual being and
consciousness: it is thus critical of Cartesian dualisms and the entire
history of idealism and formalism.  
>  Peirce, a logician primarily, explores the knowing of the thinking subject:
how and what one knows as an active participant in knowing.  
>  
>  The questions for Dewey are doing and experience, toward social and
political action. In his later work, he develops theory and practice of the
body as human agency: the one which is and observes; little developed by other
theoretical approaches.  
>  For Mead, we are social creatures, much like other social species: our
individuality is emergent, not a given. Questions of knowledge, of language,
of how a finite creature has extension in time and space. We are bodies in
interaction; sensual creatures, not merely purveyors of logic and the shadow
flickerings of a back-lit cave. How, this course asks, do we study our being
in the depths of its wholeness, and in the social contexts of our being?  
>

>>

>> There has been some significant work since the days when Dewey and
Pragmatism were important. Among the authors of these ideas extending,
particularly, Mead, are essays and critiques of Erving Goffman, H. Garfinkel,
and Harvey Sarles.  
>  The course will be conducted as a directed dialogue.  
>  Requirements are an essay to be written in consultation with Professor
Sarles. Class participation will contribute to the final grade.

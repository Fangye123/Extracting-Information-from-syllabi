## Schedule

History 21 will meet according to the schedule listed below. So that you can
get the most out of the lectures and class exercises you need do all the
assigned reading listed for each day _before_ the class meets unless otherwise
noted. As with all courses at Furman we expect you to plan on spending at two
to three hours a day outside of class time on reading and assignments.
Included in this should be _at least three hours each week throughout the
term_ for your final term project.

Please note that the midterm examination and the film showings have been
scheduled to begin at 6:00 p.m. These are regular class meetings and
attendance is expected. Alternative times may be arranged only after
consultation with me and with permission from the Associate Dean's office.

Students with disabilities who need academic accommodations should contact the
Susan Clark, Coordinator of Disability Services, (2998) immediately. After an
meeting with the Coordinator, contact me during my office hours. Don't
procrastinate: do this EARLY in the term.

All required online documents and on-line discussions can be reached by

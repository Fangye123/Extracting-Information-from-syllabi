**Course Description and Objective**

HIST 2112-394 covers the second half of the History of the United States. The
objective of this course is to familiarize students with the growth and
development of the United States since the Civil War, emphasizing not only
chronological and political history, but also social and economic history of
the country and its relationship to the world.

This course will be taught completely online. Chapter outlines are provided as
a learning tool. Students are expected to read each chapter on the assigned
dates based on the thematic outline and engage in discussions on the
Discussion Area. The Discussion Area may also be used to post relevant
questions to the instructor. In most cases, I will respond to the questions
within a twenty-four hour time frame. Tests, exams, assignments, etc. will be
provided online and it is the responsibility of the student to check their
availability and complete them before he deadline expires.

In addition to the Discussion Area, students may correspond with me using the
private mail feature in WebCT. I strongly urge students to use the Discussion
Area only to post discussion items regarding chapters or relevant questions.

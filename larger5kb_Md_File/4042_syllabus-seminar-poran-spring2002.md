**Course Objectives:**  
**This is a course focused on feminist research practices in which you .will
engage in writing**  
**a feminist research paper. We will be discussing feminism and feminist
research practices, ranging**  
**from question formation to language use, methodological concerns, and
presentational styles.**  
**Class time will be organized in order to provide an educational space for
you to examine, hone,**  
**and share your knowledge offeminist theory and research. Over the course of
the semester, the**  
**inflllcence of ideology on research practices will be investigated through
readings, discussion, and**  
**implementation of your own work.**

**In this course you are responsible for creating the class, meaning how we
organize our**  
**time is dependent on your own interest, research, participation and support
of one another's work.**  
**The structure of the class itself is a feminist restructuring, in which my
job is primarily to facilitate**  
**and your job is to actively participate in the design and direction of your
work, as well as how**  
**class discussions and topics are to be covered.**

**Your work will consist mainly of the design of a research project and paper.
This paper**  
**will follow the same process, but be of shorter length and smaller scope,
than a "typical" master's**  
**thesis. You will be completing and presenting each phase of research, with a
focus on how your**  
**own work can contnDute to existing feminist discourses. [This course
fulfills the University**  
**writing requirement].**

**Course Requirements:**  
**You are expected to:**  
**_Read all course materials and be fully prepared_ to discuss them, as well
as integrate**  
**them (or their meanings) into your own work. You will also be required to
seek out readings**  
**pertinent to your own work and share them with the class.**

**_Participate in class discussions:_ You must come to class ready to discuss
readings**  
**(assigned and self-sought), to share your own progress, and offer critique
and ideas to your**  
**student colleagues to assist them in their work.**

**_Fullv complete all phases of vour research/writing proiect_ : You will be
discussing**  
**your ideas, focusing on a research question or paper topic, writing a
proposal for your work.**  
**engaging in a thorough literature review, and creating a full final research
paper. Do not be afraid!**  
**This class is about how to execute what may at times seem like a giant
undertaking: writing**  
**something which perhaps is longer and of greater depth than anything you
have written before,**  
**and creating a piece which is presentable at the professional level. All of
these points in process**  
**will be presented to the class and discussed. The culmination of the
semester's work will be a 25-**  
**30 page paper (not including bibliography). You will be evaluated on the
content, construction,**  
**and level of analyses of your drafts as well as in your final written
work.**

**_Outline of Semester (dates to remember)_ : This is a general overview of
the semester's work.**  
**As you progress with your research, you will provide the class with
information to review such as**  
**written work by others and yourself. I will also be handing out additional
readings as they pertain**  
**to your work.**

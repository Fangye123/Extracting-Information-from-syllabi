**_COURSE DESCRIPTION:_**  
The goal of this course is to explore the possibility of a conception of
nature true to our experiences while free from apocalyptic consequences. We
will begin with a brief overview of the current state of the environment,
basic concepts in ethics, and central themes in current environmental ethics.
Next, we will examine historical, religious, and cultural influences on our
current conception of nature and the human relationship with it. Turning then
to contemporary approaches to environmentalism, we will cover a range of major
positions currently under debate, with emphasis on critiques of
anthropocentrism including deep ecology and ecofeminism. Finally, we will
consider a recent attempt to provide a "phenomenological" foundation for
environmental thinking in David Abram's _The Spell of the Sensuous_. We will
evaluate Abram's combination of anthropological and phenomenological evidence
for the "turning inside-out" of consciousness and the "sentience" of the
Earth, as well as the ethical injunctions he draws from our embodiment.

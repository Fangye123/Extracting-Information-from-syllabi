WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT and TERM PROJECT

1\. Book Reviews

Each sudent will prepare two book reviews comparable in length and style to
reviews in professional journals such the American Historical Review, Journal
of American History, or The Public Historian. The first review will be of a
book that uses oral history interviews as sources in conjunction with other
historical sources and the second will be of a book that uses oral history
interviews as the main part of the text. Reviews should be completed before
in-class discussions of the use of oral history as a source (September 19) and
of the use of oral history as the main body of a book (October 3) and turned
the day of the discussion.

2\. Oral Interviews

Each student will interview five individuals as part of a coherent project,
i.e. the interviews must be of individuals with some unifying principle. A
description of the proposed interviews that outlines the unifying principle,
the general areas for investigation, the names of individuals to be
interviewed, and sources to be used for background should be submitted by
October 15. Protocols and other relevant documets should be prepared according
to IRB guidelines.

Each interview should be approximately 60 - 90 minutes in length, tape
recorded audibly, and properly documented. At least one of the interviews will
be fully transcribed and edited. A copy of each interview will become part of
the Forest C. Pogue Oral History Institute Collection.

Each student will present a 20-minute oral report on their interviews on
December 3 or 5.

Attendance Policy Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Three
unexcused absences are permitted. For every two additional unexcused absences
the final grade will be reduced by one letter grade, (i.e. from A to B.)

Absences will be excused for the following reasons: participation in a
university-sanctioned activity or program; death in the family or other family
emergency; serious illness with a doctor's note; jury duty; military
obligation; or weather emergency making travel dangerous.

Students are also expected to attend the entire class and remain awake.
Arriving late, leaving early, or dozing off will count as an unexcused
absence, except in highly unusual circumstances. Students are responsible for
all material presented in classes they miss or changes in the course schedule
that are announced in class whether their absence is excused or unexcused.

Students who require special arrangements for exams or in-class presentations
must make such arrangements themselves at least one week prior to the exam or
presentation. Students with a valid excuse for missing an exam or in-class
presentation are responsible for informing the instructor as soon as possible,
but no later than the day following the exam or presentation.

University policy on class attendance will be followed.  

* * *

Academic Honesty Policy It is expected that each student will only submit
their own original work on exams and all written assignments. The College of
Humanities and Fine Arts' policy on academic honesty and university policy
will be followed.

The objective of this course is to introduce you to the rich body of
theoretical and empirical research done on state politics and policy. Because
this topic is so broad, we will examine this literature selectively. The
required reading is neither exhaustive in subject area nor methodological
approach, but it will allow you to get a good sense of the questions that are
interesting to state politics scholars, as well as the techniques they employ
to address these questions.

  
  

Most of the required readings are available in the stacks of the Wise library.
See me if there are any that you cannot find.

  
  

These are my expectations of the work you will do for this course:

1.) Read all the works listed in each of the seven _starred_ sections of this
syllabus (***), all the works in _four_ other sections (your choice), and any
other related works that you need to read in order to understand these topics.

2.) Write literature review papers on three areas of state politics and policy
research. These will be in the range of 8-12 pages of text, doubled-spaced.
These papers will be more than simple summaries or descriptions of articles
and books. They will require that you analyze, synthesize, and evaluate the
works individually and as a group. You may organize them around discrete
research questions they seem to address, theoretical perspectives that can be
compared and contrasted, historical development of the investigation of some
important question in political science, or some other organizing principle
you find appropriate. This will undoubtedly involve going beyond the readings
listed in the syllabus for each of these topics- I offer them only as a
starting point for these papers.

3.) Private discussions with me on at least three occasions in which we can
discuss these areas of state politics and policy research.

| **Course Title:** The History of World War II: Europe **  
**

**Course Description:** World War II was the greatest cataclysm in history.
Tens of millions of people died in battle. Millions were murdered simply
because of ethnic or religious reasons. Millions of innocent civilians were
caught up in a conflict of which they knew little and understood less. World
War II changed the face of modern Europe and the world. It is the purpose of
this course to examine the history of World War II to determine the
significance and meaning of the conflict for this generation of Americans.

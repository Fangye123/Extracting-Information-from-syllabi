explore the role of the Christian Right in elections and policy making.

_GOVT 527 Public Opinion & Voting Behavior_ (Syllabus)  
This course will introduce students to the theory and research on public
opinion and political behavior. Although the course will focus primarily on
the U.S., there will be readings throughout on other countries as well. The

variety of methodologies. Students will complete the readings on time and
discuss them in class, write one major paper, and take a final exam.

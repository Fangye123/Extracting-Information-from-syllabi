> **Course Description**

>

> Why do we punish? Is it to rehabilitate criminals, to protect society, or to
exercise revenge on behalf of the victims? Why are more and more Americans in
prison, even as the crime rate declines? How does the history of punishment in
other times and places help us to understand the dilemmas of today?

>

> In this course we will explore crime and punishment from a variety of
perspectives -- literary, sociological, and historical. We will begin by
considering the origins of the modern prison. Next we will examine changing
impressions of crime and the criminal in science and culture. Looking at
Europe and the U.S., we will consider how changing images of the criminal have
shaped responses to crime. Finally we will read two brand new books on
punishment in the contemporary United States.  
>  
>

> **Requirements**

>

> **_Reading_**  
>  Readings must be completed by the dates indicated on the syllabus. Not all
readings will be discussed in class, but every text will be important to
framing our discussion, filling in detail,  and helping you clarify and
formulate your thoughts.

>

> **_Study Questions_**  
>  You will be required to submit responses to study questions prior to most
classes. The questions may be found below by way of the web links for each
class meeting.

>

> Study question responses must be clear and grammatical. Do _not_ submit
notes or lists or incomplete sentences. (Though you are strongly encouraged to
include your own questions and "half-baked" thoughts). Responses may be as
long or as short as you feel is necessary.

>

> In order to receive credit, responses to study questions must be sent to me
before 9PM on the evening before class. My email address is
wrosenbl@webster.edu. Please write "Study Questions" on the subject line of
the email and be sure to write your name and the week number at the top of
your submission.

>

> Study question responses will count toward the class participation grade.  
>  
>

> **_Attendance and Participation_**  
>  Participation in class discussion is mandatory. If you come every week and
never talk, you will _not_ do well in this course \-- regardless of how you
perform on the written assignments. Attendance is, obviously, required. (If
you're not there, you can't participate). Students with more than four
unexcused absences will receive a failing grade for the semester.

>

> **_A Note on Plagiarism_**  
>  Plagiarism is the submission of work which is not your own. It is a form of
cheating. The _minimum_ punishment for plagiarism is a failing grade for this
course. Cases of egregious and deliberate plagiarism (e.g. submitting an
entire paper which you did not write) will be referred to university
administrators for further sanctions. If you have any questions about what
constitutes plagiarism or how to insure that the work of others is properly
cited, please consult Hacker, _Writer's Reference_ , discuss it with me, or
call the Writing Center.  
>  
>

> **_Oral Presentations_**  
>  You will be required to make an oral report on one of the topics listed
below. Reports will begin on Week 7 and continue until Week 14. The Reports
should be 15-20 minutes in length and must be based upon outside research.

>

> Along with your report you must submit a list of sources, with a description
of any non-published material (including websites) and an explanation for you
believe this source is reliable and/or interesting.  
>  
>

> **_Film Screenings_**  
>  There will be a number of films screened outside of class. If you are not
able to make these screenings, you will have to find the film and view it on
your own prior to the date it is discussed in class.

>

> The following screenings have been scheduled. You can click on the film for

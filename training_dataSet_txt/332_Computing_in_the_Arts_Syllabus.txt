COURSE OVERVIEW
The class consists of a weekly lecture and lab. The lectures will cover
the history of computers and computing in the arts, and theories and trends
in new media art and digital culture.We will investigate conceptual strategies
and creative possibilities for artists working in new media and will examine
the immense visual, social, and psychological impact of the "Digital Revolution"
on our culture.Thoughout the quarter, we will view a broad range of work
by artists who use the computer as a medium, as a tool, as subject matter
or all of the above, screening projects on CD-ROMS, the Web and videos
as well as other cultural artifacts of the digital age, from games to chat
rooms. During weekly labs, students will be introduced to the Silicon Graphics
work station and will use some of its basic media and mail tools to develop
art projects. Also during labs, students will discuss the required readings
and present and critique their art projects.

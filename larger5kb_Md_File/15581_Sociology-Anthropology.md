**Purpose of the Course:** The basic purpose of the course is to familiarize
you with the principles, assumptions, and stages of social science research.
Major steps in the research process will be covered including selection of the
problem, statement of hypotheses, formulation of research designs, and the
collection and processing of data. Statistics associated with sampling and the
early stages of data analysis will be covered including frequency
distributions, cross tabs, reliability measures, and elaboration. The course
should sensitize you to crucial issues in the acquisition of scientific
knowledge.I hope the course will not only prepare you to evaluate research
projects and studies reported in journals but also enable you to design and
conduct your own research.  

**Required Texts:**

Babbie, Earl. 2001. _The Practice of Social Research_ (9 th Ed.). Wadsworth
Publishing Co. Wagenaar, Theordore and Earl Babbie. 2001\. _Practicing Social
Research_ (9 th Ed.). Wadsworth Publishing Co. Bring this book to class.

Other readings may be announced that are on reserve in the Library.

**Requirements and Expectations** **:**

1. **Grading** ****C Final grades will be based on a students total points. The breakdown of points is as follows: Points (1) Three exams, 100 points each 300  
(2) Homework, class work and announced and unannounced quizzes  300  

Total 600

Assignments include exercises from the Wagenaar and Babbie book and practice
using SPSS for Windows, Version 10.Other assignments will provide applications
of stages of the research process. Late assignments will be docked two points
per day, including weekends.Class work missed and quizzes missed will be
recorded as a zero. Your first assignment is to send my teaching assistant for
this course, Magdalena Tolea, an email from your UMBC computer account. This
is due by February 8.Your second assignment, also due on February 8t,h is to
turn in the syllabus acknowledgment paper from this syllabus.

Make-up exams are only given with a valid reason and evidence thereof--such as
a doctor=s note.A student who must miss an exam should call the instructor
prior to the exam or leave a message with the Department of Sociology ( 410
455-3979).The make up exam may be different from the original exam and must be
taken within a week of the scheduled exam.Students who fail to notify the
instructor or the Department of Sociology about missing an exam or who fail to
make up the exam within one week will be given a zero for that exam.Before
each exam students will be given guidance on how to prepare for it.

**Attendance:  
** Exams are based on lectures as well as the readings.You are responsible for
all announcements made in class and for getting any readings or handouts from
class. Students are also held responsible for knowing material in any class
films or from any guest speakers.Students are required to come to all computer
labs held in the ECS building.The schedule of computer labs will be announced
later.The computer work will be done during the last half of the course.

**Readings:  
** A schedule of reading assignments from the Earl Babbie text is provided at
the end of the syllabus.Although this schedule will generally be followed, it
is common for alterations to be announced in order to accommodate to the pace
of the class.Students will need to read the chapter(s) before the week it is
listed on the syllabus (except for the first week, of course).I strongly urge
extensive note taking for all readings.The material in the course is commonly
new and challenging for most students and note taking is often helpful in
organizing and remembering lots of unfamiliar concepts.

It is not possible to provide direct links to the following programs. You will
have to go to PUBLIC via the usual route (i.e., the Chooser). However, when
you get there, follow the paths noted below to some useful software.

Here is a selection of what is available to you. In some cases, the links lead
to a particular file, but more commonly, they lead to directories of files.
Some of the information will be very useful (or at least interesting); some
will be useless. Take a look around!

![](devil.gif)**Sample Exam Questions** "Nobody expects the Spanish
Inquisition! Our chief weapon is surprise" ...Monty Python

Solutions to first sample exams will NOT be provided. On the other hand, you
are welcome and encouraged to stop by my office with your solutions and
discuss them with me. The corresponding hour example from the last offering of
this course is provided with solutions in the next section.

            * [Sample Exam 3](http://www.dartmouth.edu/artsci/chem/introchem/samp1.html)

Exams and the exams in this course.** "You must try, try and try. You succeed
at last!"...Jimmy Cliff

Yes, the solutions are here, but you should try to solve these problems
without the solutions. Stop by during office hours to get help if necessary,
but try to avoid using the solutions until you have answers to the problems.

![](q_mark3.gif)**Questions??** "Talk to me!" ...Southside Johnny and the
Asbury Jukes

OK, so you've got a question. If you submit that question using the form
below, it will appear in my BlitzMail box. I intend to collect these notes,
write replies and then post both the questions and replies on a separate page.
All notes and replies will remain on the page until the end of the course. You
may submit anonymously. If you choose to include your name, I'll purge that
information before posting a reply.

Willows

The [Department of Chemistry](http://www.dartmouth.edu/artsci/chem/) maintains
its own site on the WWW. Here, you will find a description of the
Undergraduate and Graduate Programs, a listing of faculty, a brief description
of the research interests of the faculty and various other interesting pieces
of information.

In addition, several of the faculty have their own sites with detailed
descriptions of their scientific interests.

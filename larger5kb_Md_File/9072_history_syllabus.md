_Description:_ In this course we will ask: How do clothes make the man (and
woman)? How has style - in its broadest sense - come to function as an
expression of a person's political positioning, sexual/gender politics, and
allegiance to groups and subcultures such as "working class," "lesbian," or
"punk"? Conversely, how has style been used to limit the individual's mobility
and freedom, that is: to keep people in their place? What is the relationship
of capitalism to the marketing of sex, the appropriation of subcultural style,
and the system of fashion? We will discuss these issues and others in relation
to the politics of style in America, France, Britain, Japan and Imperial
China, looking at elements of style such as fashion, hair, manners, foot
binding and body arts like tattoo and piercing.  
  
_Requirements:_  
1) Attendance, diligent reading, and active participation in all class
discussions.  
2) Two analytic papers --approximately 6-8 pages  
3) One final project -- approximately 10-12 pages - based upon fieldwork
investigation of a style.

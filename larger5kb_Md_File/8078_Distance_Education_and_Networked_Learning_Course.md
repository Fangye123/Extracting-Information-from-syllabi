## Course Objectives

As a result of this course, participants will be able to :

  * describe current leading-edge work in distance education in K-12, higher education, business, government, and military settings 
  * depict the ways in which learning and teaching across barriers of distance and time are similar to -- and different from -- face-to-face instruction 
  * gain fluency in using various interactive media (asynchronous threaded discussion sites, synchronous multi-user virtual environments, groupware, interactive presentational media, videoconferencing), instructional frameworks (e.g., WebCT) and applications (e.g., telementoring) 
  * apply effective instructional design for various interactive media, instructional frameworks, and applications. 
  * experience how each medium for interacting across distance shapes the cognitive, affective, and social dimensions of learning and indicate the range of individual responses to these media 
  * describe methods for evaluating the effectiveness of distance education approaches 
  * discuss how innovations such as the World Wide Web, multi-user virtual environments, computer-supported collaborative learning, telementoring, and online communities are shaping the evolution of distance education and distributed learning

## Course Requirements

  * Attendance and participation in class sessions -- whether face-to-face or virtual -- is mandatory, as discussions and shared experiences are important parts of the course. The class schedule may change as the course progresses; changes will be posted on the online course website and in WebCT's asynchronous class discussion site. 
  * Each student is expected to complete all readings and class exercises, as well as two assignments and in-depth contribution to asynchronous threaded discussions. 
  * Obtaining and regularly using a computer account with access to the Internet, the WorldWide Web, and GMU's WebCT site is required. GMU makes such accounts available for free to its students. 
  * To enable individualization of the course to the needs of each student, special arrangements on requirements and assignments may be negotiated in writing with the instructor. Revised assignments typically involve direct, extensive involvement in some project engaged in the design, development, evaluation, or implementation of a distance education experience. 
  * Students missing the due date for an assignment must make immediate arrangements with the instructor to fulfill that requirement before the next class. 

* * *

## Class Activities

This course will utilize a combination of lectures, hands-on experiences,
media, guest speakers, field trips, discussions, and projects to help
participants understand the strengths and limits of current technologies for
distance education, as well as the likely evolution of distributed learning.

## Assignments

Each student is expect to complete two assignments chosen from the menu of
possibilities below, or an alternative assignment can be negotiated in writing
with the instructor. Both assignments have equal weight in grading (33%). In
addition, the quantity and quality of contribution to the WebCT asynchronous
discussions is another 33% of the grade. Both brief individual plans for the
assignments and the assignments themselves are due on dates specified in the
Course Outline and are to be submitted via email using the instructions posted
on the online syllabus.

**_Select Two of the Assignments Below, or Propose Another Alternative to the
Instructor_**

**A. Assessing a Telementoring Experience.**

This assignment involves:

  * serving for an extended period of time as a telementor for someone you did not previously know 
  * preparing an eight page paper that presents a) "lessons learned" about your experience relative to the research literature on telementoring, and b) an analysis of the telementoring medium used and ways that it affected the quality of the learning/teaching experience. 
  * discussing in WebCT the conclusions you reached with other students who completed this assignment 

**B. Assessing Extended Learning Experiences in a Multi-User Virtual
Environment (MUVE).**

This assignment involves:

  * participating in at least ten one-hour learning experiences conducted in a MUVE 
  * preparing an eight page paper that presents a) "lessons learned" about your experience relative to the research literature on educational MUVEs, and b) an analysis of the MUVE used and ways that it affected the quality of the learning experience.. 
  * discussing in WebCT the conclusions you reached with other students who completed this assignment 

**C. Studying Website-based Learning Environments.**

This assignment involves:

  * selecting three substantial websites that provide related, informal learning experiences (e.g., three museum sites or three professional development sites for teachers).comparatively analyzing the design of the sites on criteria of content quality, usability, and pedagogy. 
  * interacting with the organizers and (if feasible) some users of these websites to determine how effectively the sites are meeting the needs and expectations of their users. 
  * preparing an eight page paper that presents "lessons learned" about websites' quality and ways they could improve their services, relating this to the instructional design literature on effective websites for learning. 
  * discussing in WebCT the conclusions you reached with other students who completed this assignment. 

**D. Examining an Existing Distance Education Program.**

This assignment involves:

  * selecting an existing academic, corporate, government, military, or commercial distance education program.interacting with the organizers, teachers, and students to determine how effectively the program is meeting the needs and expectations of these three sets of stakeholders. 
  * analyzing the extent to which the program is based on the ideas and principles in the Distance Training text. 
  * preparing an eight page paper that presents "lessons learned" about the distance education program's quality and ways it could improve its services. 
  * discussing in WebCT the conclusions you reached with other students who completed this assignment. 

#### E. Evaluating Alternative Vendors Providing Videoconferencing for
Distance Education.

On March 1st, 2nd, and 3rd, 2000, the [2000 TeleCon East
Conference](http://www.teleconexpos.com/east2k/index.html) will be held at the
Washington Marriott Wardman Park Hotel, Washington, D.C. This assignment
involves:

  * spending several hours in the Exhibits area of TeleCon East (the instructor will obtain free passes for all students who wish to attend the exhibit area) 
  * comparatively analyzing the wares of three alternative vendors who provide equivalent specific products for some aspect of distance education videoconferencing (e.g., three companies who sell ISDN-based videoconferencing equipment and services) 
  * preparing an eight page paper that discusses relative merits and demerits of each competitive system based on criteria of cost, compatibility, evolutionary path, usability, and customizability 
  * discussing in WebCT the conclusions you reached with other students who completed this assignment.

## Assessment

This course is graded on an A, B, C, and F basis. Grades will be based on
completion of course requirements and on the scope, quality, and creativity of
the two assignments. Once feedback and a grade are received on the first
assignment _only_ , if a higher grade is desired the student can resubmit a
revised assignment within two weeks. The grade assigned to the revised first
assignment is final. The extent and quality of contribution to WebCT
asynchronous discussions counts as 33% of the final grade and are not subject
to revision; an interim grade will be provided at mid-semester for
informational purposes. Incompletes in the course will be given only under
unusual extenuating circumstances.

**Assignment for 3/6:**

**_Asynchronous Discussion in WebCT on TI Website Demonstration Experience_**

_INSTRUCTIONS FOR THREE DEBATES IN WEBCT DURING WEEK OF 3/6_ :

Three debates will be posted in the asynchronous discussion section of WebCT,
grouped as usual by last name. Within your group, you are asked to make at
least THREE contributions to EACH debate of the three debates, spaced out over
the period from March 6th through March 12th. Each contribution should make
arguments based not only on personal experience and insight, but also on
theory and research from the course readings and other sources. Rather than
making "it depends" arguments in your postings, you should take one side of
the issue or the other and make arguments as to why that version is superior.
Of course, if you are convinced by arguments others are making, you can switch
sides. Enjoy the debates and see how you feel about this type of
format/rhetoric in asynchronous discussions vs. the format we have used so
far.

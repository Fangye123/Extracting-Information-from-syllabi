**Course Objectives**  
This course is a survey of the African-American experience in the United
States from colonial times to the present. Because it is a survey course, we
will not have the opportunity to give as much attention as you may desire to
every important, interesting, and controversial topic. However, we will
discuss a wide range of issues about which you will be expected to think and
form your own opinions. African-American history is challenging because it
requires us to come to terms with a culture that is both unique and an
integral part of American history. Your papers and exams will give you ample
opportunity to wrestle with those ideas. Be forewarned: rote memorization of
facts and dates will do you little good in this class. Because this course
will be primarily discussion based, with lecture time included where
necessary, be prepared to think for yourselves.

**Course Requirements - Undergraduates**  
The instructor expects each student to keep up with the schedule of readings
that appears on this syllabus. You will have a much better idea of what's
going on if you have done the reading. These assignments, along with
information from our discussions and the occasional lecture, will provide the
material for the papers and exams. There are 650 possible points to be earned
in this class. There will be two (2) essay/ID exams, one at midterms and one
during finals week. Each exam will be worth 100 points. You will also write
two thought papers worth 100 points each. Over the course of the semester, you
will develop a research project of some kind in consultation with the
instructor. It may take the form of a paper, lesson plan, or anything else
that we can agree upon and will be worth 150 points. Finally, you can earn up
to 100 points for class participation. (Please recognize that I understand the
difference between quality and quantity when it comes to discussion.) Your
course grade is determined by your average and is based on a standard 10-point
scale.

**THERE WILL BE NO CURVE.**

**Course Requirements - Graduate Students**  
Graduate students will meet the same requirements as the undergraduates. In
addition, they will write outside reviews of three additional books related to
their research project.

**Makeups**  
Makeups must be taken within two weeks of a missed exam or paper and will only
be given if the student has a university-approved absence. **It is your
responsibility to arrange the makeup**. Unless there are extenuating
circumstances, makeups not completed within two weeks will have a score of
zero entered on the gradesheet. Students with unexcused absences will not be
allowed to take a makeup.

**Writing Identification Exam Questions**  
On identifications, keep three things in mind. First, identify the person,
place or thing so that I know that you know what it was. Next, put the item in
historical context so that your understanding of its place in history is
apparent. And finally, if possible, demonstrate that you understand why the
item was significant. Why did I ask you about it? What was its historical
contribution?

**Writing Essay Exam Questions**  
When writing essays, it is important that you build your answer around some
kind of thesis statement. Be blunt and put your thesis in the opening
paragraph. The remaining paragraphs should strengthen your thesis while
answering the question. I often write essay questions that ask you to explain
different aspects of a basic question. You may find it easiest to make each of
these aspects the subject of its own paragraph. Be sure to support your essay
throughout with details from lectures and your readings. Make it **crystal
clear** to me that you understand the material. Finally, include a strong
conclusion where you tell me what you just told me in the rest of the essay.

**Writing Thought Papers**  
Twice during this semester you will be asked to write a thought paper. Each
time, you will be assigned a broad question to think about. Your paper will
give you the opportunity to answer the question in a very personal way. I will
not assign a question with the intent of receiving a specific answer, but I
will expect you to demonstrate a working knowledge of the materials covered to
date. Each paper should be no less than 5 typed, double-spaced pages in
length.

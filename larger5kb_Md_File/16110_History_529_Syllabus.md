**What is History 529(WR):**  
This course serves two purposes.  It is an in-depth look at the modern era in
our nation's history.  In addition it is a WR course.  That means much of the
course will be devoted to the experience of researching and writing a
historical paper.  This course meets the WR and Historical Studies
compononents of the General Education requirements.

**Subjects of this Course:**  
In this course we will cover topics from a variety of types of history:  
Diplomatic -- the United States' role in the world during the Cold War  
Political -- the rise and fall of the role of the federal government in
American life  
Social -- social life and customs;  movements for social change  
Economic -- the ups and downs of the economy and their social impact

**The Paper:**  
Because this is a WR course you will be required to write in several forms:
essay tests, book reviews, and a major research paper.  The paper assignment
is designed to take the whole semester and time is built into the course for
you to work on it.  An assignment sheet for the paper will be distributed in
class but in brief:  For undergraduates the paper will be 15 pages.  For
graduate students the paper will be 20-25 pages and will include a
historiographical section.  You will turn in a complete draft of the paper,
receive comments, and then revise for final submission.  During the semester
you will be asked to turn in a series of short assignments, as follows:  
Paragraph description of research topic, due September 5.  
Annoted list of sources, due October 3.  
Outline and thesis statement, due November 16.  
Draft, due November 28.  
Final paper, due December 13.

  * Tests.  40%.  20% each.  There will be two exams in this class, on October 12, and December 5.  There is no final exam.  The second test is not cumulative.  Each test will consist of an essay and short answers.

****COURSE DESCRIPTION**** :  
  
This course examines the historical context of Native people on stage from
pre-colonial time (circa 1600) to the present as demonstrated in the ways they
were characterized on stage by non-Native playwrights.  The course
specifically emphasizes the contribution of Native playwrights to the American
theatre as a reflection of the philosophies and ideologies of Native people.  
  
****LEARNING OBJECTIVES**** :  
  
At the conclusion of the course, students will be able to:

  * identify the four major periods in American theatre in which Native people are portrayed 
  * describe the characterization of Native women in American theatre both historically and in modern times 
  * critically analyze the works of Native playwrights as a response to prior and prevailing racism and stereotyping of Native people.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
** Everyone is for justice, just as they are for peace, freedom, and
democracy. The question is: What kind of justice? Achieved through what kind
of systems and institutions? What constitutes a just society? Which political,
social, and economic systems and institutions are most likely to produce
justice? We will ask these questions and then move on to assess the role of
mass media in social justice. What role can journalists and media institutions
play in the quest for justice? Do contemporary commercial news outlets help or
hinder the work of building a more just society?  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
** We will divide our time between discussions of readings, discussions of
exemplary journalistic works on social justice, and presentations of student
work.  
  
Writing assignments include:  
(1) a short essay that completes the sentence, "In a just society, ..." (2-4
pages, 5 percent of final grade);  
(2) a short essay that completes the sentence, "In a just society, journalists
would ..." (2-4 pages, 5 percent of final grade);  
(3) an analysis of an exemplary journalistic work (2-4 pages, 15 percent of
final grade);  
(4) a scholarly paper on some aspect of social justice and the media, or a
journalistic project that examines a question of justice in the world (50
percent of final grade).  
  
The remaining 25 percent of your grade will be based on participation in
class, assessed according to your: (a) familiarity with readings; (b) ability
to hear and understand what others say; (c) ability to express yourself
clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others to form new insights
or questions; (e) ability to disagree constructively; (f) cooperation in
building a stimulating and supportive intellectual atmosphere in class; and
(g) attendance.

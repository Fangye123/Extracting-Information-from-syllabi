**Course Description**

This course examines how decisions about energy, natural resources and the
environment influence the rise and fall of human societies. From the simplest
hunter-gatherers to the most complex industrial economies, human societies
organize themselves around the supply of energy and other natural resources.
The relation between human societies and the environment is analyzed using
principles from ecology, economics, sociology, political science. Attention is
focused on the environment's influence on economic production, political
structures, the role of women, and how these structures and attitudes enable a
society to flourish or collapse.

The first part of the class develops the tools needed to understand the role
of energy and other natural resources. These tools start with the laws of
thermodynamics and build to a new way of representing society. In summary, the
laws of thermodynamics constitute the rules of the game by which all societies
play. The goal of the game is simple, stay in the game. Capturing more energy
and resources than your competition is the way that one stays in the game.
Successful societies organize their existence about these goals while failed
societies go astray of these basic principles.

The second part of the course examines how these rules shape human history.
The principles taught in the first half will be used to analyze the structure
of hunter gatherers, agriculturalists, and industrial societies. Discussion
will focus on and the rise and fall of several great empires, such as the
Mayan, Egyptian, Roman, and British. A detailed view of these changes is
illustrated by the settling of New England, where changes in energy and
resources supplies brought about by European settlers destroyed the native
American population and how industrial revolution's appetite for energy,
resources, and labor, eventually destroyed the settler's way of life.

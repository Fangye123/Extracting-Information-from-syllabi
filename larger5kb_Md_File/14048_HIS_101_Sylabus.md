      ![Blue Separator Bar](photos/bluebar.jpg)   **Overview**   
HIS 101 reviews the general history of the West from about 3000 bce to 1600 ce
and allows students to reach a basic understanding of the characteristic
features of the West's historical development.  The course also helps students
to develop an understanding of the academic discipline of history and supports
the general educational goals of historians and the college.  Grading in the
course is based on written assignments and on class work that demonstrates
critical thinking.  It is expected that students possess college-level writing
skills.   There are many reasons to study history.  For example, history
provides a good background for careers in law, journalism, teaching,
engineering and politics.  Since most people will change careers many times in
the course of their life, it is desirable to have as wide an educational
experience as practical to prepare for future possibilities.  Another reason
for studying history is that it provides a framework for understanding the
other humanities, such as the fine arts, literature, philosophy and religion,
as well as the other social sciences (psychology, economics and sociology).
History also helps to develop active and intelligent citizens who can
distinguish between the important and the inconsequential, fact and
conjecture, evidence and assertion, and make informed judgements in personal
and public life.  Finally, the study of history is a humbling experience, for
the historical record is resplendent with tales of ignorance, deceit,
arrogance and brutality.

**Required books**  
The text for the course is Marvin Perry, **Western Civilization (Volume 1)** ,
6th ed., which comes shrink-wrapped with Rand-McNally, **Historical Atlas of
the World**.   There are a number of short paperbacks required:  **Gilgamesh**
; **Song of Roland** ; Chaucer, **Canterbury Tales** and Machiavelli, **The
Prince**.   (Any editions of these books are acceptable.).  You can buy these
materials at any campus bookstore, the [bookstore
website](http://www.bkstore.com/nvcc/) or by phone at 888.744.7839.  You may
also be able to buy the textbook directly from the
[publisher](http://college.hmco.com/cgi-bin/SaCGI.cgi/store.class).  Also,
Houghton-Mifflin does maintain a web [ study
site](http://college.hmco.com/history/west/perry/western_civilization/6e/students/index.html)
to complement the textbook.  The site may prove to be of some help to you in
your studies in this course (In its current form as of June 2001, I have not
found the site to be very good.).

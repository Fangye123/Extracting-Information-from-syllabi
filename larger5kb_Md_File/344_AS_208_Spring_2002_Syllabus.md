The paper should reflect an analytical point of view based on evidence,
research sources, and clear argument. Students need to hand in a brief (1 or 2
paragraph) description of  their term paper topic on Friday, March 29th.  
  
**Guest lecturers:** This course will expose students to the concepts and
methods of area studies focused on Southeast Asia.   Faculty members of the
Southeast Asia Program will give guest lectures about how their disciplines
approach the study of a diverse and complex region.  Members of the faculty
are leaders in their fields and the course provides a unique opportunity for
students to meet these scholars.  
  
**Important notice:** To pass this course, regular attendance is essential.
Although readings provide useful information that will supplement the
lectures, exam questions will rely on an understanding of in-class
presentations.  Quiz, exams, and term paper cannot be made up except in cases
of documented illness or family emergencies.  Anticipated absences should be
cleared with the instructor or teaching assistant before they occur.

Attendance

_

Punctual attendance is required, and students arriving after roll is called
are considered absent.  **Two unexcused absences are allowed.**   In order to
have absences excused, students should submit the appropriate signed form from
the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (see pp. 100-101 of the
TSU Student Handbook).   This form is also required for the make-up of missed
exams.  Each unexcused absence beyond the two allowed will lower the class-
participation component of the final grade.

_

Exams

_

Including the final, there are three exams in the course, each consisting of
multiple-choice questions, terms for identification, and one essay question.
Although I will try to have some spares available in case of emergencies,
please remember to bring at least one **small exam book** (blue book) to the
exams.    These should be available in the campus bookstore.

_

Essays

_

Two essays of approximately six to eight pages in length are due on **March 9
and April 27** , respectively.  Essays submitted after these dates are subject
to a grade reduction of five points per day.  The essay topics, based on the
books by Browning and Ash, will be assigned in the course of the semester.

_

Academic Honesty

_

All students are expected to maintain ethical integrity.  Any instance of
cheating or plagiarism constitutes grounds for the assignment of an F in the
course, and such cases will normally be reported immediately to both the Vice
President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs.

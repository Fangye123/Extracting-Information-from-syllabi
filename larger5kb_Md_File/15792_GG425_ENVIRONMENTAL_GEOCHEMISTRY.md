**Course Content:**  
FOR students preparing for a career in the environmental and geotechnical
fields ...  
AND FOR students just wanting to know more about the environment around them.
In this class students learn about natural processes of Earth's surface and
the environmental effects of human activities.  Both global and local
phenomena will be examined from a chemical perspective.  We will cover natural
and anthropogenically perturbed aspects of the Earth's hydrosphere and its
interaction with surficial rocks, sediments, soils, the biosphere and the
atmosphere.  Students will learn the science behind today's environmental
issues. Course content is largely based on applied geochemistry, with
supporting content in theoretical geochemistry, organic chemistry, inorganic
chemistry, biochemistry, and microbiology. A student doesn't have to be a
chemist by training or an environmentalist by temperament to succeed in this
class.  |  
Topics include:

  * Organic molecules in nature; Organic contaminants in ground water: sources, sinks, remediation techniques.
  * The geochemistry of the atmosphere and atmospheric precipitation, "acid rain", the ozone layer, some atmospheric pollutants.
  * The global carbon cycle, stable isotope geochemistry, atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases; Global Climate: Past, Present and Future.
  * Energy, technology and resources 
  * Aquatic Microbial Biochemistry 
  * Lakes, Rivers and estuaries: nutrient overloading, oxygen depletion, urban sewage.
  * Heavy metals in ground and surface waters, both natural and non-natural distributions.
  * Drinking water and Sewage Water Treatment
  * Chemical weathering, soil formation, geochemistry of clays, vadose groundwater composition.
  * The oceans, marine chemistry, primary productivity, Gaia, Marine Sediments: a record of environmental global history, light isotope geochemistry.
  * Natural radioactivity; Radioactive waste composition, storage and disposal.

**Grading:** on a curve. Based on: Midterm exam (33%); homework (33%); final
exam (33%)  
Class participation/attendance is not mandatory, but is taken into
consideration in borderline grading situations.  Please turn homework
assignments in on time.  Grading penalties of 10% per day will apply unless a
valid reason for a late assignment is discussed with me ahead of time.

Supplemental Reading: as needed (Located  in bookcase outside my office).  
**Class Format:** |  This is a lecture course. I encourage students to
actively ask questions in class, particularly if they  are not understanding
something I am explaining. Most important material will be discussed in class,
but is typically covered in more detail in the reading assignments.  If one
keeps up with the reading, it will help them get the most out of the lectures.  
**Lecture Notes:** |  These are available for students to download from the
course website as adobe acrobat files.  These are not required reading, nor
are they a substitute for taking your own notes.  They are meant to be a guide
to lecture content.  
**Class Handouts:** |  I typically give handouts in class containing
supplemental overhead figures discussed in class that are not in the textbook.
These will be numbered consecutively and will be useful for homework
assignments and studying for exams.

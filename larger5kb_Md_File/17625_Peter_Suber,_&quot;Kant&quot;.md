>  
> The only required text for this course is Immanuel Kant, _Critique of Pure
Reason_ , translated by Werner S. Pluhar, Hackett Pub. Co. 1996. I have asked
the bookstore to stock Kant's _Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics_ as well;
it is recommended but not required.

>

> We will try to read the whole _Critique_ in one semester, even though we
know that is impossible. A few chunks of text are merely recommended, not
required, but no part is skipped entirely. Every section of this big book is
important, for influence or for inquiry or both. Our job is to do it justice
and live to tell the story.

>

> No reading from the _Prolegomena_ is assigned. I recommend that whenever you
encounter a difficult passage in the _Critique_ you should read the
corresponding section of the _Prolegomena_. (If you do not encounter a
difficult passage in the _Critique_ every night, seek counseling.) The
_Prolegomena_ was published after the first edition, and before the second
edition, of the _Critique_ , and was aimed at a broader audience. It is
therefore slightly more authoritative than the first edition, slightly less
than the second, and intended by Kant to be more intelligible. (You can judge
this for yourself.) It is also much shorter.

>

> I have put the standard German edition of the text ( _Kritik der reinen
Vernunft_ , Felix Meiner Verlag, B/2775/1971) on 24 hour reserve in Lilly
Library.

>

> The following three books are in the reference section of the library and
cannot be put on reserve: Howard Caygill, _A Kant Dictionary_ , Blackwell,
1995, Ref/B/2751/C3.8/1995, Rudolf Eisler, _Kant-Lexikon_ , Georg Olms Verlag,
1979, Ref/B/2751/E4, and Heinrich Ratke, _Systematisches Handlexikon zu Kants
Kritik der reinen Vernunft_ , Felix Meiner Verlag, 1965, Ref/B/2779/R3/1965.

> I've created a course home-page containing a collection of hand-outs and
course-related web links at
<http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/kant/kanthome.htm>. If you find any
other relevant links, let me know and I'll add them to the collection.

> **Reading**

>

> Works and pages cited for a given day will be discussed that day and should
have been read in advance. Those in square brackets are recommended but not
required. Explications and papers are due at _class time_ on the days listed.

>

> "A" and "B" numbers refer to the first and second editions of Kant's
_Critique_. You can find them in the margins of our book. This is the standard
way of citing Kant's text. In the reading schedule below, "WSP" numbers refer
to pages of the Werner S. Pluhar translation (Hackett Pub. Co., 1996), and
"NKS" numbers refer to pages of the Norman Kemp Smith translation (St.
Martin's Press, Macmillan, 1929).

> I've stuck in a **review day** every couple of weeks. Here are some of my
ideas on how to use these days; let me hear yours.

>

>   * Review the sections of the book we just finished. Ask any questions that
you didn't have a chance to ask earlier. Tie up loose ends. Put the details
into a larger picture. Get comfortable evaluating, not just interpreting,
Kant's position and arguments.

>   * Discuss how to write a paper on Kant and how to write philosophy papers
in general. Go over some possible paper topics.

>   * Talk shop about library research in philosophy. How does one find
scholarship on a particular philosophical topic, figure, or period?

>   * Assess the quality of our discussions. How could we improve?

  
>

>

> **Assignments**

>

> Title | Due date | Weight | Description  
> ---|---|---|---  
> Eight explications (seven graded) | Even-numbered days except Day 12 | 5%
each | One page each. Full sentences, outline format, very succinct.
[Details.](/~peters/courses/explcat.htm)  
> First paper | March 10 | 20% | 7-10 pages. Topic from a [list](paper1.htm) I
provide. Topic due February 22. Details.  
> Evaluation form | April 24 | 0% | Due any time before the last day of class.
Use the hardcopy form I will hand out or print yourself a copy of the [online
version](/~peters/courses/evalform.htm).  
> Second paper | May 3, noon | 20% | 10 page minimum. On a topic of your
choice from the second half of the book. I have a [list](paper2.htm) of
suggestions. Topic due April 21. Details.  
> Participation | Daily | 25% | Attendance plus helpful, voluntary
participation in every discussion. Includes giving presentations and leading
discussion on Tuesdays. Details.  
> With the exception of explications, you must submit all assigned work to
pass the course.  
>  
> **Explications**

>

>> Note that the days spent on Kant's text are numbered 1-19. On every even-
numbered day (except Day 12), a one-page explication will be due at class
time. The grade on the first explication (Day 2) will not be recorded in order
to allow you to master the genre without trauma.

>>

>> The nature of an explication is described in a [separate hand-
out](/~peters/courses/explicat.htm).

>>

>> The explication topics for a given day are in the hand-out on [reading
questions and explication topics](weekly.htm). An explication topic is a
thesis or conclusion whose arguments must be explicated.

>>

>> Hand in two copies of each explication, one with your name and one without.
With a word processor, this should not be a problem. I will grade and return
the copy with a name. The anonymous copy will go to a file on reserve for the
rest of the class to consult.

>>

>> Because explications will help support class discussion on the days they
are due, I will not give extensions on them. And because so many are due, I
will not allow rewrites. Your time will be better spent making the next one
good than making the last one better.

>

> **Papers**

>

>> Two long papers are required for this course. The first should be 7-10
pages long, and the second, 10 pages minimum. The first should be on a topic
from [a list I provide](paper1.htm). The second may be on a topic of your
choice that is central to Kant's project in the second half of the _Critique
of Pure Reason_. (For this purpose, the "second half" of the book starts with
the Transcendental Dialectic.) I have a hand-out of [suggestions for the
second paper topic](paper2.htm), but you do not have to pick your topic from
the hand-out.

>>

>> In both papers, library research will be welcome but is not required. Also
in both papers, you may incorporate any relevant work already done in
explications.

>>

>> The topic question of your second paper is due in writing in Week 15, well
before the paper itself is due. If you can settle on your topic even earlier,
you should consider doing so; that will give you more time to digest Kant's
text. Because grades are due shortly after the due date, I can give no
extensions on the second paper.

>>

>> The paper assignment (for both papers) is described in more detail in the
[essay assignment](/~peters/courses/essay.htm) hand-out.

>>

>> If you can read the _Critique of Pure Reason_ in German, or if you know
German well enough to consult the original for nuance lost in translation,
then you may depart from the assignment in some respects and write a more
interpretive paper on that nuance if you wish. But speak to me first. In any
case, please use whatever German you know when marshalling the textual
evidence for your interpretation of the text, struggling with difficult
passages, and conducting research in the library.

>>

>> See my [generic hand-out](/~peters/courses/generic.htm) for details on
[paper mechanics](/~peters/courses/generic.htm#formalities),
[lateness](/~peters/courses/generic.htm#lateness),
[rewrites](/~peters/courses/generic.htm#rewrites), and the option of having me
[grade your paper on tape](/~peters/courses/generic.htm#tape). In this course,
save the option of taped evaluation for the long papers; I prefer to grade
explications by hand.

>>

>> If you submit a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your final paper,
then I will mail it to you during the break. If you only have your campus mail
box number on the paper, then I will mail it to your campus box. If you do
neither, I will hold it for you to pick up next fall.

>

> **Discussion**

>

>> This is a seminar; hence, there will be very few lectures. Attendance and
good preparation are essential to the success of a seminar. I expect all of
you to be fully prepared every day to discuss the reading, ask questions about
its meaning and merit, help others to find the answers, discern
presuppositions, trace consequences, reconstruct arguments, evaluate the
strengths and weaknesses of positions, and recognize the stakes.

>>

>> I am aware that with a book like the _Critique of Pure Reason_ , you will
seldom feel ready to "answer" questions with any finality during discussion.
You will be conscious of how many parts of the text you didn't understand; you
will have doubts; you will be tentative. This is natural. _But your
tentativity is a good reason to speak, not a good reason to remain silent._
For example, you can offer tentative answers in the spirit of experimentation
or exploration. You can talk about what you didn't understand; what
difficulties you'd like cleared up before we finish with a given section or
topic; what sub-questions must be answered before we can answer the main
question; what terms and concepts make the question perplexing; what the best
contenders seem to be for the answers, and what can be said for and against
some (or each) of them; what passages or issues are relevant in exploring the
question; and so on. But don't wait to speak until you have certainty, or you
will wait forever.

>>

>> With this understanding, I expect everyone to talk voluntarily every day. I
will not call on non-volunteers unless it is necessary to bring in every
voice.

>>

>> At the request of past students, I've made a list of [think-about
questions](weekly.htm) to accompany the reading. These should help you focus
on important issues as you read. They also point to likely topics of future
class discussion on which you ought to be prepared (at least with page
numbers). All the explication topics and think-about questions will be worth
your cogitation even if we don't reach them in class.

>>

>> There are two easy ways to use the hand-out of questions. Either print it
out to carry with your book or click on the day's questions in the reading
schedule above.

>>

>> I hope to make use of [electronic
discussion](/~peters/courses/maillist.htm) to continue and deepen our in-class
discussions. I've set up an email list for this course. If you send an email
to the list, then everyone in class receives a copy automatically. To use the
list, simply send email to **kant** or **kant@earlham.edu**. For answers to
common questions about using such a list, see my [electronic discussion hand-
out](/~peters/courses/maillist.htm).

>

> **Presentations and leading discussion**

>

>> Starting Week 3, the first half of every Tuesday class is reserved for
student-led discussion. (I will lead on Review Days which happen to fall on
Tuesdays.) Discussion leaders need not have done any outside reading or
library research, although I recommend it highly. They should be especially
well prepared on the parts of the text assigned for that day. Leaders should
start with a 10-15 minute presentation in which they offer a reading of
selected parts of the text of interest to them. For the rest of the hour, they
should lead discussion on those and other, related topics. In the presentation
and subsequent discussion, the leaders will not lecture, and need not have
answers, but should have good questions and know where in the text to look for
answers and how to lead a discussion that discovers answers. Each leader
should give me a short outline of their presentation and plan for discussion
at the beginning of the hour. I will be glad to meet with discussion leaders
beforehand to discuss topics and methods. See the [hand-out on
presentations](/~peters/courses/leaddisc.htm) for more information.

>>

>> Everyone will present and lead discussion at least once. You will present
and lead discussion in pairs. Which Tuesdays go to which students will be
decided first-come, first-served. If there are no volunteers for a given
Tuesday, I will throw dice. Look ahead at the assignments and your work for
other classes, and volunteer as soon as you can for the week of your choice.

>>

>> If the enrollment is too small to allocate student discussion leaders to
every eligible Tuesday, then I will look for volunteers to go more than once
for extra credit. If the enrollment is too large to put only pairs of students
in each eligible Tuesday, then on some Tuesdays students will lead in teams of
three.

>>

>> The chief elements of the participation grade are attendance, preparation
for class, performance in discussion, and the week(s) as presenter and
discussion leader. The two large papers must be submitted to pass the course.
Explications which are not submitted will be recorded as zeroes.

>

> **Finding help**

>

>> If you need help, please don't hesitate to talk to me in my office. Here
are some other possibilities:

>>

>>   * If it's not convenient to see me during my [office
hours](/~peters/sched.htm), send me an [email](mailto:peters@earlham.edu).

>>   * Talk to one of our [TA's](kanthome.htm#ta's). They have phone numbers,
email addresses, and office hours.

>>   * Ask your questions in class. If you have questions, chances are that
others do too. I'd like a chance to answer them for everyone.

>>   * Send your question by email to the electronic discussion list for this
course, **kant** or **kant@earlham.edu**. Give everyone a chance at it.

>>   * Read my [hand-outs](kanthome.htm#handouts). They should help,
especially with details on assignments.

>>   * Use the [reading questions and explication topics](weekly.htm), at
least as a guide to important topics in a day's reading.

>>   * Use Pluhar's index. It's very detailed and comprehensive. Remember that
it uses A and B numbers, not Pluhar numbers.

>>   * Use the searchable version of the [Norman Kemp Smith
translation](kanthome.htm#nks). It gives you A and B numbers which you can
take back to the Pluhar translation if you like. It also shows you your search
terms in context with links to their occurrences in the full text.

>>   * Consult the German-language original, on reserve in Lilly Library.

>>   * If you know enough German to use a dictionary, but not enough to read
Kant in the original, then consult Pluhar's glossary in the back of his book.

>>   * Consult one of the Kant dictionaries in the Lilly reference area.

>>   * Consult the table of contents to help you see the forest through the
trees. Pluhar has a very detailed one at the front of his book. I have a [more
selective one](toc.htm) online which may be more helpful for seeing the large-
scale structure of the book.

>>   * Read the _Prolegomena_ to see how Kant simplified and clarified the
passages which might be causing you difficulties. To find passages in the
_Prolegomena_ corresponding to passages in the _Critique_ , see my
[map](prolkdrv.htm).

>>   * Reread Kant's prefaces. They give an overview of his position. You'll
get more out of them once you're in the middle of the book than you got out of
them at the beginning of the semester.

>>   * For secondary literature on Kant in print, use [Philosopher's
Index](/~peters/courses/philindx.htm) to find what you need.

>>   * For secondary literature on Kant online, use
[Noesis](http://noesis.evansville.edu/) to find what you need. My collection
of [Kant-related web links](kantlink.htm) should also help.

>>   * Read the explications on reserve in the Philosophy Department foyer.

>>   * Start a study group with other class members.

>

> **General education credit and prerequisites**

>

>> This course normally does not satisfy a general education requirement in
philosophy. Because it has two prerequisites, we assume that students who take
it have already satisfied the requirement. If you have not yet satisfied the
distribution requirement in philosophy, then you have not taken the
prerequisites either. If you are in this position, please see me soon.

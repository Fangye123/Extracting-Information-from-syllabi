**[SYLLABUS](c4dg-syl.htm)** | **THEME :** **Modernization transformed
political life, the way people came to think of the state and its role in
their lives. The modern Nation State and the force of Nationalism  became
major shapers of the modern world, contributing to the power of the West by
the beginning of the 20th century. During the 19th century western nations
developed the modern state into a powerful engine that helped advance their
interests in the world. People came to focus their identities, allegiances,
and interests with their nation, a community sharing a common culture. ** |

## FROM DYNASTIC TO NATION STATES

### **I. THE TRADITIONAL/MODERN TRANSITION IN POLITICS**

> **Traditional states that developed in Medieval Europe were both dynastic
and often multi-national. A royal family commanded the loyalty of people in
the territories they controlled, often extending over various ethnic
communities. The references for loyalty were found in feudal relations and
local communities.   [See [Lecture III](c4-iii.htm)] By the nineteenth century
the biggest multi-ethnic dynastic states were the Hapsburg, Romanov, and
Ottoman Empires of central and eastern Europe. **

>

> **That tradition was challenged by the legacy of the American & French
Revolutions, transforming subjects into citizens: The French revolutionary
slogan, Liberty, Equality, Fraternity, points to the ideals behind
citizenship. People were not to be considered subjects of a monarch or prince
but citizens with individual liberty, equal before the law, and brothers and
sisters of one national family. From those ideals came  two major ideologies
that shaped the 19th-century nation state: **

**[Liberalism](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/liberalism/)[:](http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/9/0,5716,127639+1+117288,00.html)

**[Nationalism](http://www.nationalismproject.org/what.htm) : See TB:753-755**  
>  
> **These ideologies, born in the Age of Revolution, sparked revolutions
during the 19th century and gave rise to several new nations. By the end of
the 19th century there were more countries than before and the very concept of
the Nation State became a feature of the modern world.  **

>

>
**[Conservatism](http://library.thinkquest.org/3376/Genktk6.htm?tqskip1=1&tqtime=0329)
[See TB: 753],   developed as a reaction to these revolutionary ideologies,
also shaped modern political life.  This extensive  Web reference on
[Conservatism](http://counterrevolution.net/trad.html) puts the concept into a
broad context. Review the SB's selection from [Edmund
Burke](http://www.blupete.com/Literature/Biographies/Philosophy/Burke.htm)'s
criticism of the French Revolution for some of the basic ideas of
conservatism. In the early 19th century the views of [Joseph de
Maistre](http://www.umanitoba.ca/faculties/arts/history/maistrebio.html)
provide an example of reactionary thought. **

### **III. REALPOLITIK AND THE NATION STATE, 1850-1900**

> **Historians see the[revolutions of
1848](http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/r/revol1848.asp) as a turning point.
The first half of the century was a time of liberal hope and Romantic
yearning; the last half one of Realism. The German word REALPOLITIK captures
that change - a politics of realism, of using power and cunning to achieve
objectives. It was realism not the ideal of the liberal reformers that
prompted conservative people like Count Cavour in Piedmont and Prince Bismarck
in Prussia to become  Conservative Sponsors of National Unification.  In
central Europe the aristocratic enemies of nationalism began to co-opt the
movement for national unification in both Italy and Germany.**

> **NATIONAL UNIFICATION: ITALY AND GERMANY  
>  ** **Italians and Germans got their nation states as results of efforts by
dynasties advancing their own interests, the dynasty   of Savoy in Italy and
the dynasty of Hohenzollern in Germany. **

>> **Note the[constitutional structure of Prussia after 1850](reich2.jpg). The
Prussian king's prime minister, Bismarck, shaped the new German [Reich in
1870](file:///C:/WEBSHARE/WWWROOT/cs4dfg/reichpol.jpg) after the Prussian
model.  To what extent does it conform to or deviate from liberal ideals? How
does it compare to political structures in Britain or the [United
States](file:///C:/WEBSHARE/WWWROOT/cs4dfg/usconst.jpg)? **

>>

>> **The multi-cultural, ethnically
diverse[Hapsburg](file:///C:/WEBSHARE/WWWROOT/cs4dfg/hapsb.jpg) Austro-
Hungarian Empire kept Austria out of the new German Reich. But the effects of
1848 produced some changes, most notably special status for the Magyars
(Hungarians).**

>

> **NATIONAL UNIFICATION: THE UNITED STATES.  
>  Throughout the first half of the 19th century the American republic was a
model for liberal reformers and revolutionaries throughout the western world.
But the great republican experiment had a glaring contradiction - its liberal
ideals clashed with the reality of slavery. That contradiction subverted
national unity to the point of Civil War between 1861 and 1865. **

>

>> **Expansion and Civil War: The dilemma caused by slavery and racism grew
greater with the expansion of the young republic. The thirteen original states
increased as the vast western territory extending to the Mississippi was made
into states. In 1803 President Jefferson more than doubled the size of the
country by negotiating the [Louisiana Purchase
Treaty](http://lsm.crt.state.la.us/cabildo/cab4.htm) with Napoleon. American
nationalism, identifying with the principles of liberty and constitutional
government, came to see the whole continent as, in Jefferson's phrase, an
Empire of Liberty for the American republic. This view of the destiny of the
American nation state can be glimpse in John L. O'Sullivan: [On Manifest
Destiny](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/osulliva.htm) (1844) The Mexican
War (1846-48 ) led to a further expansion of territory. By the 1850s the
question of how many of the new states carved from these western territories
would be slave or free produced the Civil War.

> **NATIONAL STATES, 1870-1900 : After 1870 the modern nation state was still
not established in Russia, eastern Europe, Austria-Hungary and Ireland where
people still had to struggle for states of their own. In western Europe there
was the greatest movement towards progressive political measures; in central
Europe dynasties and the aristocracy weakened attempts at parliamentary
government,  and in Russia royal absolutism continued. In Europe politics in
the major nation states had several focuses:**

>

>> **Movements towards liberal objectives like constitutions, parliaments, and
individual liberties**

>>

>> **Growth of political democracy through universal male suffrage, mass
political parties**

>>

>> **Development of socialist parties**

>>

>> **Social welfare legislation**

the rights of individuals and groups searching for equality.  **

israel.org/jsource/Zionism/zionism.html): One of the results of the French
Revolution and the Napoleonic reforms of European life was the move to allow
Jews to enjoy the rights of citizenship as they did in the new United States
and in Revolutionary France.  During the 19th century nation states granted
Jews such rights, but that so-called
[Emancipation](file:///C:/WEBSHARE/WWWROOT/cs4dfg/jews19c.jpg) was also
accompanied by the growth of anti-Semitism, well illustrated in the [Dreyfus
Affair ](http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-
pale/english/25.html)(1894) in France. [Theodor Herzl ](http://www.us-
israel.org/jsource/biography/Herzl.html)developed the Zionist movement in 1896
to deal with the realities of anti-Semitism in the new nation states. Note
that the greatest concentrations of Jewish population were in the multi-ethnic
dynastic states of south central and eastern Europe, as this[ map of
1930](file:///C:/WEBSHARE/WWWROOT/cs4dfg/jews1930.jpg) illustrates. **

[AMER 3701](javascript:;): Approaches to American Studies (course code 0262)  
ENGL 4864: Selected Topics in American Literature (course code 1376)  
_"If we regard truth as something handed down from authorities on high, the
classroom will look like a dictatorship. If we regard truth as a fiction
determined by personal whim, the classroom will look like anarchy. If we
regard truth as emerging from a complex process of mutual inquiry, the
classroom will look like a resourceful and interdependent community."_  
_\--_ Parker Palmer, _[The Courage to Teach](javascript:;)_ , 51

**Prerequisites**  
For [ENGL 4864](javascript:;): English 690, English 3701, or English 3702

**General Education Information**  
For students completing the "new" general education program, this counts as a
[writing-intensive course](javascript:;).

**Course goals**  
Over the next fifteen weeks, we'll explore the history, experience, and
representation of work in the Youngstown area, using literature, visual
images, artifacts, maps, and other resources. We'll focus on three key ideas:

  * In American culture, and specifically in the Youngstown area, work and class help to form individual and community identity but are also sources of conflict within the community.
  * Literature exists within a cultural framework, not as something separate from its culture but rather as a set of texts that are intimately involved with culture. 
  * Interdisciplinary analysis can yield rich, complex insights into representations, including literary texts, and into the processes of identity formation, cultural negotiation, and social change.

By the end of the semester, you should be able to demonstrate your
understanding of these concepts in the following ways:

  * Write papers and complete projects that use specific information about work and class in Youngstown and discuss in concrete terms how they affect the formation of identity, moments of conflict, and community change.
  * Write about literature and other representations in ways that position them within their cultural context, making clear, specific links among texts and between representations, history, and theoretical concepts.
  * Develop thoughtful, insightful analyses of identity formation, cultural negotiation, and/or social change that draw on multiple kinds of representations (including literature), historical understanding, and theoretical models.

**Texts**  
_Who Built America? Working People and the Nation's Economy, Politics,
Culture, and Society_ , Volume Two, American Social History Project  
_Out of This Furnace_ , Thomas Bell  
_Literature, Class, and Culture_ , ed. Paul Lauter and Ann Fitzgerald  


**Assignments**

  1. _[Single Text analysis](http://www.as.ysu.edu/~amerst/SingleTextAn.htm)_ \- Choose one reading from Lauter  & Fitzgerald, and write an analysis that explains what the text says and how it conveys its ideas. 10%
  2. _[Text web](http://www.as.ysu.edu/~amerst/TextWeb.htm)_ \- Match your literary text with at least three others from the same period, including at least one visual image and at least one artifact, and write an essay explaining how the texts relate to each other. 20%
  3. _[Adding history to the mix](http://www.as.ysu.edu/~amerst/Text&History.htm)_ \- Using the same four texts, write an essay that positions them within their historical setting. How does knowing the history enhance your understanding of the texts? 20%
  4. [_Family history paper_ OR _History of a local problem_](http://www.as.ysu.edu/~amerst/FamilyHistory.htm) \- For this [project](javascript:;), you'll either research the history of three generations of one family or explore the history of one problem related to work in the Youngstown area. Then write an essay that positions the history you've learned in the context of the materials and ideas you've learned about in class. 20% 
  5. _[Integrative Project](http://www.as.ysu.edu/~amerst/IntProject.htm)_ \- Choose a moment of cultural negotiation about work and class in Youngstown, and write an analysis that links texts, historical context, and the theoretical ideas that have formed the core of the course. On-line exhibit or illustrated paper. 30%

time coming into the library. I will color the "reserve" mark red

19th century exploitation
 Pp.
120-137 in Barbarous Mexico by John Kenneth Turner (Chicago: Charles
H. Kerr & Company, 1910)
Note that this was written in 1910. The reign of Porfiro Diaz, which
led up to the Mexican Revolution in 1910 is known to historians as the
Porfiriato. After looking at the results of this reign in the forgoing
text, look at the public front that it put forth, seen in James
Creelman's interview with the generalwhich
was written before 1910. You may notice some similarity between the approach
to development then and the approach seen recently during the Salinas presidency.
The new approach is called by its critics "neoliberalism," which refers
back to the nineteenth century economic liberalism, of which Diaz was Mexico's
final proponent.

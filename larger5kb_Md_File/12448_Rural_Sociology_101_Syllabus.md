### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course provides a general introduction to the expanding field of
sociology and is intended for students who have not previously taken a
sociology course. It presents the basic concepts and tools sociologists use to
explain the social world and to interpret social issues ranging from
professional ethics in the work world, divorce patterns in the family world,
the force of mass media in the social world, social structure in one's
personal/emotional world, to globalization of everything from the drug trade
to shopping malls. The purpose is to make sociology relevant to your life.

### TEXTS:

To supplement material in the lectures and sections, all students should
purchase David Newman's, Sociology, Second Edition, Pine Forge Press, 1997,
and his book of readings: Sociology Readings, Second Edition, Pine Forge
Press, 1997. The readings assigned from these texts are attached. You are
expected to come to class and section with your readings completed and are
responsible for class announcements regarding additional or substitute
readings.

### EXAMINATIONS:

There will be a 50-minute preliminary exam held during class period on October
16 and a two-hour final examination on December 18. The final examination,
while it is comprehensive, will stress the material in the second half of the
course. Questions for all examinations will be drawn from both the lectures
and readings. Both exams will also contain material covered in the discussion
sections and may include multiple-choice, short-answer, true-false, and essay
questions. Make-up exams require your T.A.'s consent and a written excuse from
a doctor, employer or coach indicating the involuntary nature of your absence.
Unexcused absences will result in zero for the exam in question. If you have
two final exams back-to-back, you will have the option to take the make-up
exam the following day for the Prelim (i.e., October 17) or the evening for
the Final (December 18). A review session will be held at a convenient time
before both examinations.

### ATTENDANCE:

You should attend all lectures and section meetings. The lectures will
highlight readings, plus new materials, both of which may appear on exams.
Discussion section content will go well beyond the lecture material and
readings as well. Since discussion section grades will be based partly on
attendance, and the material covered in section tends not to be covered in the
lectures, it is essential that you attend section meetings. Once again, exam
questions cover lectures, sections, as well as readings for both.

### GRADING:

Grades for the course will be determined as follows:

  * Prelim Exam, 33 1/3 percent 
  * Discussion Section, 33 1/3 percent 
  * Final, 33 1/3 percent

### DISCUSSION SECTIONS:

Each student will be assigned to a discussion section led by a graduate
teaching assistant. Your section will meet once a week. Sections are designed
to stimulate discussion and debate focused on the major themes of the course.
You and your classmates are encouraged to develop your sociological conceptual
skills through discussions with each other about how society is changing, why
it is changing, and what they mean to you. Readings assigned from the Newman
Reader serve as the basis of discussion in sections. Discussion sections, as
well as T.A./Professor office hours, are a good place for you to ask questions
concerning the lectures and readings. Remember that section grades count one
third of your course grade; T.A.s may give quizzes at their discretion

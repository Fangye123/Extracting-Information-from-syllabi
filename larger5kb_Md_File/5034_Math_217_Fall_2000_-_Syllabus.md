#  Math 217 Fall 2000

## Page Update History

* Dec 27: [ A program to calculate your final grade.](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/217f00.exe)   
**DISCLAIMER:** This file is a DOS executable. There is always a risk of
running an executable file that you download over the internet. It is your
responsibility to scan such a file for viruses. Prior to posting I scanned the
linked file using the most recent signature file for F-Protect and no virus
was detected. That is not a 100% guarantee, however. If you run this program,
then you do so at your own risk!

* Dec 15: [ A worksheet on Fourier series](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/fourierR4.mws) This worksheet contains an implementation of Fourier polynomials and is illustrated with terrific plots. Grab this for later use! 
* Dec 15: **Final exam info:**  
The breakdown of the questions on the final exam goes like this - Ch 1 (First
Order Eqns): 3, Ch 2 (Linear constant coefficient equations): 3, Ch 3 (Series
solutions): 4, Ch 4 (Laplace transform methods): 2, Ch 5 (Systems): 2, Ch 6
(Numerical methods): 0, Ch 7 (Qualitative descriptions): 3, Ch 8: (Fourier
series) 3  
The table of Laplace transforms that was included with Exam 3 is again
included. No other formulas are given.

* Nov 30: [ Solutions to Exam 3. ](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/M217F00ES3R4.mws) There was an error in problem #18. Everyone will get credit for that problem.  

* Nov 29: [Last Homework Assignment](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/05F00R4.mws) Due: December 7 2000  

* Nov 29: [Solutions to assignment 4](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/04sF00R4.mws)   

* Nov 29: [Matrix algebra background worksheet](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/5.1-5.8epR4.mws)   

* Nov 29: **Exam 3 Info**  
Exam 3 covers sections 4.4-7.1 inclusive. The breakdown of questions is
Chapter 4: 7, Chapter 5: 9, Chapter 6: 3, Chapter 7: 1. Laplace transform
formulas that are introduced in the covered sections will **not** be given.
Formulas from sections 4.1-4.3 will be given. To be specific, the formulas
found in the Laplace transform section of the [ summary of assumed
knowledge](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/basic.mws)  
are given. No other Laplace transform formulas are. You do not need to
memorize the formula for the Runge-Kutta Method of Approximation.

* Nov 05: [Corrected Assignment 4](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/04F00R4.mws) If you have not downloaded the homework yet, this is a corrected version. In 1b the rightmost piece of f should be over the interval t > 15, as shown in the graph. (As typed in the original posted assignment, the interval was given as t > 12 instead.) In 2b the original template for calculating the Laplace transform of the square wave suggested that integrations over three subintervals were necessary. Only two are. In the DEplot with sawtooth forcing term, a coefficient of 3 was omitted. Also, since F is often used as the Laplace transform of f, I changed the letter of the forcing term to w.   

* Nov 04: [Corrected Assignment 4](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/04F00R4.mws) If you have not downloaded the homework yet, this is a corrected version. It eliminates the redundant ? := map( ? , ? ) commands in 1a.  

* Nov 04: [ Laplace tansform worksheet. ](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/Maple/odes/4.1-4.6epR4.mws)

Maple (despite a warning upon loading). The solutions have been worked step by
step.

## Sections

There are three sections. The core material is the same for all sections. All
sections take the same exams and get the same homework.  
  
Section | Time | Location | Instructor | email | Office Hours  
---|---|---|---|---|---  
1 | MTThF 9-10 | Busch 100 | M. Feldman |

## Course Requirements

The three evening exams, E1, E2, and E3, the final exam, and the homework will
have the following relative values in making up the overall grade:  
  
Component | Weight  
---|---  
E1 | 20  
E2 | 20  
E3 | 20  
Homework | 15  
Final | 25  
  
  
Scores out of 100 will be translated into a letter grade of A, B, C, D, F
(with plus and minus shadings) in a way that is not stricter than the
following table:  
  
Numerical Range | Letter Grade  
---|---  
[80,100] | A  
[65,80) | B  
[50-65) | C  
[40-50) | D  
[0,40) | F  
  
  

## Text

Elementary Differential Equations with Boundary Value Problems, Fourth
Edition, Edwards and Penney.  
  

## Syllabus

The following lesson plan is somewhat tentative (except for the scheduled
examinations). _Do not print this schedule and assume that it will be in force
throughout the semester. It is recommended that you check the current version
periodically._ The "suggested problems" are just that - suggested drill to
ensure that you are following the basic concepts and procedures. They are not
to be turned in. Do more or less according to your need for practice.

Maple uses the name "worksheet" to refer to a generic Maple document. There is
no work for you to do in any of the posted worksheets. _In particular, the
worksheets in the following table are not homework assignments!_ The following
worksheets correspond to the indicated section of Edwards and Penney. Using
Netscape for Windows, right click on an icon. Choose "Save Link as". Make sure
to include the mws extention in the filename. Maple worksheets are platform
independent so do not worry if you think differently. If you do a regular
click on an icon then you will bring up an ASCII file that your browser can
display but not decode. To view these worksheets as intended, please use
either Maple or the [MapleV Release 4 Demo](http://www.download.com/). Newer
releases of Maple will open the R4 worksheets, prompting you for an update.

## Homework

  
Before beginning your first homework assignment, you are cautioned to read the
statement of [academic
integrity](http://registrar.seas.wustl.edu/Undergraduate/academicintegrity.htm)
that, with the following exception, will be in force.  
  
Exception: Violations will be referred to the Academic Integrity Committee of
the School of Arts and Sciences, not the Discipline Committee of the School of
Engineering and Applied Science.  
  
**Homework Groups:**  
You may do the homework by yourself if you wish. If you prefer, then you may
form a homework group with one other student. This partnership is intended to
endure without change throughout the semester. However, homework groups can be
like marriage. Sometimes dissolution is the best course. If it is necessary,
then you may dissolve a homework group and, if another student who is not part
of another homework group is willing, then you may form your second homework
group. No more than two chances at forming a successful homework group. (The
homework graders are students. It would not be fair to them to have to
frequently reorganize their bookkeeping.)  
  
_In no circumstances will a group with more than two members be permitted.
Don't even ask!_  
  
_Homework groups are not intended as a device to share labor. It is not
permitted that you do an assignment and your partner does the next. If your
partner has not contributed significantly to the assignment, then you must
acknowledge any help he may have provided, but you must not submit the
homework as a joint effort. If you do, then you will be in violation of
academic integrity._  
---  
  
  
Homework that is to be turned in requires the use of _Maple_ , a computer
algebra system. This package is installed in the Arts and Sciences computer
lab (which is open on a walk-in basis to students of all academic divisions).
_Maple_ is also installed in the CEC (engineering) lab which is restricted to
engineering students. Here is the information that I have received on the
[cec](http://ascc.artsci.wustl.edu/~bblank/M217feedback.html#cec)version.  
  
It is no longer sensible to do differential equations by hand only. In
practice, software is a great aid - it is useful not only for problems that
would not be feasible unaided but also for problems that can be done by hand
but which are unpleasantly tedious. It is therefore important to include
computer work in a modern differential equations class. _Maple_ has been
chosen because it is the best software tool for doing differential equations.
Since _Maple_ is a general purpose mathematical tool, with packages devoted to
virtually all quantitative aspects of engineering, mathematics, and the
physical sciences, _Maple_ skills acquired now will be useful in all your
future work. Many students coming from Math 233 will have learned some Matlab.
It should be noted that Matlab is a numerical package that does only a few of
the things that _Maple_ does.  
  
The current version of _Maple_ is _Maple 6_. Great improvements in the
differential equations package were introduced in Release 5 and in Release
6.1. It is unfortunate that the release available in the Arts and Sciences lab
is the antiquated Release 4. It is anticipated that _Maple_ worksheets will
therefore be made available in both Release 4 format and Release 6.1 format.
Students who purchase the student version (approximately $100) should download
the newer worksheets since those will take advantage of a tremendous amount of
work done during the last four years. _Note, however, that purchase of Maple
is not necessary - owning your own copy would be merely a convenience._ If you
intend to use a lab copy of _Maple_ and if you have your own computer, then
you probably should download a free demo of Release 4:  
  
[MapleV Release 4 Demo](http://www.download.com/)  
  
This demo does not have all _Maple_ commands, nor does it allow you to print
or save any work. It will therefore not be useful for doing the homework. What
it will do is act as a _Maple reader_ allowing you to read the prepared
worksheets.

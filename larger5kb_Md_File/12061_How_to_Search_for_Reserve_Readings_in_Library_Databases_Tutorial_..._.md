**How to Search for Reserve Readings  
in Library Databases  
**  
  
![Reading a Journal](readjournal.gif)

  * Lesley University faculty and students may use the Ludcke Library databases to obtain articles for recommended or required reading.   
  

  * If each instructor or student prints **one** copy of an article from a database, for his or her own research, there is no copyright infringement or fee required.   
  

  * Please note: copyright clearance must be obtained by anyone who wishes to make multiple copies and distribute the article.
  
**INSTRUCTIONS**  
**Faculty / Students / Passwords / Help**  
  
**FACULTY**

  1. Select articles by searching full-text databases from the Ludcke Library [Off-Campus Database Page](http://www.lesley.edu/library/resources/databases.html). You may search by topic, or search for a particular article by title.   
  

  2. If you have an article citation and want to see whether it is appears full-text in one of our databases, check the [Full-Text and Print Journals List.](http://ada.lesley.edu/faculty/ftbell/fulltext.html).   
  

  3. To access the databases, go to the **Ludcke Library Database Page** : 
    * Go to the Lesley University Home Page at <http://www.lesley.edu>. Scroll to the bottom and click **Library**. Under **Resources** , choose **Databases.**   

    * Or click on this link: <http://www.lesley.edu/library/resources/databases.html>.    

  4. Choose **Off-Campus Access**. Enter the Ludcke Library password. If you need to apply for a password, see instructions below.  
  

  5. Copy the complete citation into your syllabus, indicating the database by name.  
  

  6. Provide a link to this page, **Reserve Readings from Online Databases** at <http://www.lesley.edu/library/guides/research/onlinereserves.html>  
for student instructions, or print and photocopy this page to hand out.  
  

  7. Notes:  

    * Choosing databases from the Off-Campus page will assure that all students have access to the database from home or work.  
  

    * Be sure to bring the full-text article up on the screen to print, even if it appears on the **Full-Text and Print Journals List** , in case there's an error in the list.  
  

    * Multi-Disciplinary Databases, listed at the top of the database page, generally offer the highest percentage of full-text articles, in most of Lesley's fields of study.  
  

    * A number of databases are available on-campus only. These databases may be used for reserve readings for on-campus courses, but faculty are advised to tell students that the articles must be obtained from computers in the Lesley network.   
  

    * Check back each semester to make sure the database still contains the article. Publishers sometimes change their minds and pull journals.   
  

**STUDENTS**  
  

  1. Go to the **Ludcke Library Database Page** : 
    * Go to the Lesley University Home Page at <http://www.lesley.edu>. Scroll to the bottom and click **Library**. Under **Resources** , choose **Databases.**   

    * Or click on this link: <http://www.lesley.edu/library/resources/databases.html>.    

  2. Choose **Off-Campus Access**. Enter the Ludcke Library password. If you need to apply for a password, see instructions below.  
  

  3. Click on the database indicated on your syllabus. In the search box, type the first few words of the article title, omitting the initial article, **A, An** or **The**. In the Result List, check that the article citation matches the citation on your syllabus.   
  

  4. If the article matches the citation in your syllabus, go to #6.  
  

  5. If there is no match, try a new search. Use the author's last name, and a word from the title, joined by the word **and** : **Coburn and technology**.  
  

  6. Bring up the **full-text** of the article on your screen. Print.  
  
| **Example:**  
  
The syllabus asks you to get the following article:  

> **Bozzone, M. (1997, March-April). Technology for kids' desktops.
_Electronic Learning, 16_ (5), 47-49. Retrieved July 11, 2001, from InfoTrac
OneFile on the World Wide Web:

    1. Go to the Ludcke Library [Databases Page](http://www.lesley.edu/library/resources/databases.html). Follow the instructions in Step #1 above. Under Multi-Disciplinary Databases, choose **InfoTrac OneFile.**   
  

    2. On the InfoTrac Page, scroll down to **InfoTrac OneFile**  
and click **Start.**  
  

    3. In the blue area, choose **Keyword Search.**   
Type **Technology for kids' desktops**. Press **Search.**  
  

    4. The full-text of the article should appear on your screen.   
If it does not, press the **Back** button and check your typing.

**Course Description:**  
Managers are increasingly being involved in and assuming responsibility for
the management of projects. These projects may involve the development of
information systems, new products or processes, single or multi-purpose
systems, infrastructure or other development projects for the public or
private sector in developing or developed countries, and a host of other
applications.  
  
Project management is widely used in business to accomplish unique outcomes
with limited resources under critical time constraints. Many managerial
problems are associated with planning, directing, and controlling resources to
meet the technical, cost, and time constraints of projects. This course
focuses on various areas of project management such as project scheduling with
PERT and CPM, time-cost tradeoffs, multi-project scheduling, resource
constrained scheduling, budgeting, cost control, and project monitoring.
Students will also learn a project management software - _Microsoft Project
for Windows_ \- in solving related problems.  
  
On completing this course, the student should have a thorough understanding of
the complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional issues in project management.

**Paper Summaries/Presentations:**  
Every student will prepare a one-page synopsis (typed) of the reading and
submit it on the day the reading is due. Also, individual students will
present and discuss the readings on the day they are assigned. The summaries
and the presentations/discussions will be graded.  
  
**Assignments:**  
Problems, essay questions, and papers will be assigned for home assignments.
Students are expected to solve all assignments. The assignments will be
collected and graded.  
  
**Compouter Case:**  
The case _D. U. Singer Hospital Products Corporation (p.430)_ has been
assigned to be solved with the help of a project management software (e.g.,
_Microsoft Project for Windows_ ).  
  
**Research Paper:**  
Groups of 3 to 4 students will work on a paper or project. Two types of
projects are possible. In the first type, the group will select a project
management related issue (e.g., scheduling, project control, resource
allocation, project planning, etc.), and compare its use, performance,
management, results, etc., in three different companies within a particular
industry. In the second type of project, the group will analyze the entire
project management function in one particular company. In each case the
fundamental objective will be to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
project management function, and provide specific directions to improve its
application.  
  
The group will share the analysis effort and should use its own initiative in
finding information from each company, using annual reports, industry studies
and, if possible, interviews. The results will be judged based on the group's
creativity of analysis, demonstrated understanding of the issues, practicality
of the recommendations and overall usage of the related project management
concepts.  
  
The group's report will consist of a written analysis identifying all sources
utilized, as well as an oral presentation followed by a classroom discussion.
Please **note** that the text of the report should be at least 20 double-
spaced typed pages. All supporting information, tables, graphs, etc., should
be part of the appendices.

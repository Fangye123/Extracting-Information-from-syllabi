Catalogue Description: Integration of theory and practice of elementary social
science curriculum and classroom group processes. Study and application of
group processes such as cooperative learning, group inquiry, collaboration,
conflict resolution, and communication. Alternative instructional approaches
for teaching social science.

TED 451 is designed to explore and develop the instructional possibilities and
innovations in teaching interdisciplinary elementary education social studies.
A primary goal will be to liberate the beginning teacher in developing
engaging, inherently memorable, and meaningful social science experiences
which promote self initiating learning, multicultural education, inquiry and
decision making. A variety of essential planning strategies, group processes
and delivery systems will be introduced, offering the teacher appropriate
choices for instructional decisions. Each student will come to a clear sense
of personal and professional quality.

Class Schedule: Class starts PROMPTLY AT ASSIGNED TIME. If you have difficulty
meeting on time, please do not take this class. Being late or absent will
impact your grade. When class meets on a school site, be sure you allow
adequate time for traffic conditions and parking.

**_REQUIRED PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES_**

**I. Lesson Preparation  **

    
    
    Early in the quarter, students will demonstrate the ability to design and write a complete instructional lesson. This will include, grade level, 
    time, materials, instructional objectives, required previous knowledge, set/motivation, content/demonstration, modeling, checking for 
    understanding, guided practice, closure and independent practice. [_Use model provided on the WEB page_.](lesson_%26sample.htm) / [Index Unit Examples](unit_component_examples.htm) or 
    [Lesson Planning.](unit_component_examples.htm) Submit by e-mail when requested (use proper SUBJECT heading)
    
    **II. Graphic Organizer** Following class instruction, students will develop a graphic organizer as an organization outline of their Thematic Unit. See examples of 
    Web Page.
    
    **III. Primary Source** You will be shown examples of primary sources used in instruction. Following his demonstration, you will be asked to
    search and find a primary source. Bring it to class and explain how you might use it in specific grade level instruction.

**IV. _Instructional Unit_ 50%**

    
    
     Students will design a **SIX** lesson integrated thematic mini unit around the social studies curriculum for the grade level theme OF 
    CHOICE. This unit, along with other materials from this class may later become a section in your Teacher Education Portfolio. 
    This should be an exciting assignment and make an effective display. This unit will be graded (see Thematic Unit Guidelines and 
    Grading Criteria) for lesson planning, unit development, creativity, Internet resources, and quality. Use of technology MUST be
    integrated into this unit. _Be sure to check your lesson format along the way._ Do not wait until the end of the quarter to work on this
     unit. It requires, thought, time and significant effort.

**VI . _Field Work Participation_**

    
    
     You will have the opportunity to participate in the development and implementation of some special thematic teaching with other members 
    of the class at a local elementary school (or we may bring the class to Cal Poly) The instructor will arrange this experience and further 
    details will be provided. **In addition to the planning time, the actual participation will be one full morning later in the quarter.
    You will submit a two page summary of this experience _the week following_ your participation.
    
    VII. Field Trips  **

**_A. The City Trip/Culture/Art_**

    
    
     Students will be participating in "The City Trip", where you will have the opportunity to visit social studies related sites within the downtown
    Los Angeles area. This will combine many curriculum areas as transportation, city government, history, art, commerce, geography, language,
    inquiry and cooperative learning. **This is a class field trip which you will partake in small groups. It _is not_ for family, friends or 
    children.** You will be given specific instructions related to this field trip. It should be a great morning of fun and learning. You will submit a 
    Summary of this event providing reflections of your day. Submit as per weekly assignments. (see [ WEB Page http://www.metrolinktrains.com](http://www.metrolinktrains.com)) 
    **The trip will take place on Monday April 29th in lieu of our class meeting. Time approximately 8:00-2:30 Reflection paper due 
    the following class meeting. Please bring in an extra copy of photographs to be used for our bulletin board. Take lots of pictures.**

**_B_** ** _._**[ ** _Museum of Tolerance_**](http://www.wiesenthal.com/mot/)
**(classmates, friends and or family)**

    
    
     Visit the Museum of Tolerance (in Los Angeles) _anytime_ before the due date. Reservations should be made and allow 4 hours for this event. 
    An alternative will be assigned for those who have already had this experience. You will submit your ticket, brochure and one page summary as 
    evidence. [ Click Here](http://www.wiesenthal.com/mot/) for schedules and admission information.

**_C. Children's Bookstore_** **(A part of the literature social studies
lesson above)**

    
    
     Visit a children's book store and explore the literature that may be connected to the study of social studies. Thus, themes like immigration,
    family, growing up in the city, the farm, culture etc. would be appropriate. They should be picture books, generally about 32 pages of 
    motivating illustrations and print. One suggestion would be Mrs. Nelson's Book Store on Bonita Avenue in San Dimas or the Thematic 
    Attic in Covina (not the big chain stores). These stores offer discounts to my students and teachers. Be sure to ask

**_This and That_**

    
    
    **_You will be required to utilize e-mail for this class_**. Either a commercial or education account is fine (even free). Be sure to e-mail me 
    your address if you did not provide it at our first class meeting. No E-mail No class! Labs are available throughout the campus for e-mail 
    and Internet access for those who need this connection. Telecommunicating in this course is not an option, but a requirement. We are in 
    the 21st century. **ALL E-MAIL** MUST CONTAIN IN THE SUBJECT HEADING, CLASS NUMBER,, YOUR NAME. e.g. 
    **__SUBJECT: 451 ,Jennifer Smith._ My filtering system will return e-mail that does not include the proper heading. _** Also, as a back up, 
    _use your name as a signature_. It is often difficult to know who an e-mail is from when the screen name is hamsterfriend@ , littleblueyes@ or
     bigguy@aol.com. Submissions without name will be returned unread. **_Services such as hotmail and yahoo do not always perform well 
    with attachments._** **Be aware. cc: yourself to be sure
    There are other assignments that are assigned in class each week. You are responsible for completing them by the due date or 
    presentation date.**

**Assessment and Grading**

    
    
    **_ALL assignments are required to receive a passing grade. The level of quality and performance will 
    determine the grade._**  
    o  Completion and participation in All assignments and field trips is required.
    o **Attendance and Promptness: Attendance is required in this class**. Absences due to illness, family 
         emergencies or some unforeseen event may occur. Being absent will/may impact your grade. 
         However, use good judgment attending class when you are ill. _If you will be absent or late ,_ please 
         phone my office and leave a message on my voice mail (909) 869-2321. This is the same professional
         courtesy  you would be expected as an employee of a school. **IT IS EXPECTED THAT YOU WILL 
         ARRIVE ON TIME.** Being late will negatively impact your grade. Being repeatedly late and/or 
         missing two or more classes may result in not passing this course.
    o Arrive at every class meeting with a positive attitude. This is what would be expected if you are a teacher of young children.
    o  All work completed in a professional manner and **submitted _on the due date_**. No late work.
         All homework assignments and projects are to be word processed and  free from excessive errors. 
    **INCLUDE YOUR NAME , COURSE NUMBER AND E-MAIL ADDRESS ON EVERYTHING.**  
         Ask yourself, " **Would you submit this to your superintendent?**

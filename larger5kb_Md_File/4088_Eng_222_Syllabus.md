**Course Rationale:**



222 surveys British literature from the early 19th century through the late
20th century.  While we cannot possibly do an exhaustive job of treating the
three major literary genres (we do some justice to the novel and poetry but
very little to drama), we will be discussing at least some representative
works from each of the major movements and periods.  Because this is a survey
course, it makes no pretense to thematic unity.  Rather, some lectures will
touch on the broad spectrum of literary, historical, and intellectual issues
out of which this literature emerged; others will zoom in on the literary
works under discussion for the week.



* * *



**Requirements:**



There are four major requirements comprising 90% of your grade:  **a midterm
essay exam (25%)** , **two 5-7 page critical essays (20% each)** , and **a
final essay exam (25%)**.   The due dates for these are marked in the syllabus
below.  Topics for the critical papers will be distributed in class 2 weeks
before the paper is due.  In addition to these, 10% of your final grade will
come from your participation during class discussions and from your grades on
the **quizzes** , which will be given randomly and without advance notice.
Attendance at all lectures and active participation in class discussions are
absolutely essential to success in this course.  Please take comprehensive
notes on your reading and have all reading assignments completed by the day on
which they are due to be discussed.



The purpose of this online syllabus is to point you toward Web sites which
provide additional information about writers, about writing essays, and about
literary theory. You may also email any of your instructors with questions
about paper topics and tests. If you have questions about getting started on a
paper, you can help us help you by providing us with a thesis paragraph and
asking us to respond to it. General grading guidelines for the critical papers
can be found [here](http://www.public.asu.edu/~dbivona/papers.html).



**N.B. We expect that your papers will conform to ASU guidelines on academic
honesty. That is, we expect that all work is your own except for that which
you have explicitly cited on your "Works Cited" page. This means you must cite
ideas and words borrowed from online sources as well as from books and
articles found in the library. If you have further questions about this
policy, see the statement issued by the Women's Studies
Program[here](http://www.asu.edu/clas/womens_studies/honest.htm). It provides
a succinct summary of the policy in effect in this class.**



If you are interested in a readable introduction to basic theoretical issues,
start by taking a look at [John Lye's Literary Theory: An
Introduction](http://www.uwm.edu/people/jat/THEORY.HTM) and the [Glossary of
Literary
Theory.](http://dev.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/headerindex.html) For
links to sites that offer help with rhetorical terms or with mythological
background, see [Starting Point for Literary
Research.](http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~angela/literary.html) Essays written for
this class should conform to the conventions set out in the [MLA Format and
Citation Guide.](http://atl46.atl.msu.edu/fall/citation.html) You may find it
useful to consult a writing handbook. The following three are currently
available on the Web: [Elements of
Style,](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/) [Online English
Grammar,](http://www.edunet.com/english/grammar/) and [Able Writer: A Rhetoric
and Handbook.](http://www.odu.edu/~jpb/ablewriter.html) You should also make
use of a dictionary such as the [WWWebster
Dictionary.](http://www.m-w.com/dictionary)



To start, see [ASU's Hayden Library.](http://www.asu.edu/lib/)  For useful
general sources of information consult the following: [Literary Resources
Page, ](http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/Lit/)[Encyclopedia Britannica
(ASU only),](http://www.eb.com:180/) and [Voice of the
Shuttle.](http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/) For online literary texts try these
sites: [Modern English
Collection](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/modeng.browse.html), [The Online
Books Page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html), and [Literature Online
(Chadwyck-Healey; ASU only).](http://lion.chadwyck.com/)  The latter database
is also useful for keyword, phrase, and line searches of British and American
poetry, British drama, and some fiction (the online fiction collection of this
database is presently rather small).  You may also find the [British History
Timeline](http://www.britannia.com/history/time1.html) a useful source of
historical information.  While there is not much online literary criticism
currently available, you may find the  [IPL Online Literary
Criticism](http://www.ipl.org/ref/litcrit/) site and [Project
MUSE](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/) useful.

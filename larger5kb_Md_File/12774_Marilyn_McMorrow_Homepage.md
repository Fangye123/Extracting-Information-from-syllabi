Trained in Political Theory and International Relations, Professor McMorrow's
work focuses on normative and ethical issues in international politics. _Her
book Not By Bread Alone: Deprivation, Subsistence Rights, and Obligation in
International Society_ (forthcoming) makes a moral argument that the society
of states is obligated to eradicate absolute poverty.

**Fall 2002:  
**_GOVT 406 Human Rights & International Relations_ (Syllabus)  
Course Description not yet available.

_GOVT 420 Ethics & International Relations_ (Syllabus)  
An examination of the ethical dimensions of critical problems facing the
international community-for example, resort to force, intervention, poverty,
environmental degradation, and migrant/refugee flows. We will focus on
critical questions such as: What is the moral standing or justification of the
principle of state sovereignty? What moral ends or principles constrain a
state in pursuit of its national security? The class considers these issues
through both theoretical readings and case studies.

**Spring 2002:  
**_GOVT 406 Department Seminar: Human Rights/International Relations_
(Syllabus)  
The adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, on December 10,
1948 may well turn out to have been the most significant human and political
achievement of the twenty-century. Students in this seminar study the
political theory and history of Human Rights doctrine, as well as the actions
taken by the international community during the past fifty years to
articulate, codify, and implement international and universal protections for
human rights. Students also come to grips with some of the central theoretical
and practical challenges to rights claims. They select a particular rights
issue to research, and they present and complete a major seminar paper on that
topic.

([Syllabus](http://www.georgetown.edu/schall/#2.%20ELEMENTS%20OF%20POLITICAL))

#  Women on the Web:  
Ways of Writing in Historical Perspective

**What if writing had been invented to help escaped slaves?** (Do you know
what it was invented for? Where? When? What counts as writing?) What if
printing were still used by people in "corresponding societies" for purposes
of revolution? (And what quite different sets of political purposes does mass
publication enable today?) What role did the fax machine play in the Tiananmen
Square democracy movement? (Or carbon paper in the former Soviet Union?) How
is the internet used today to subvert political, religious and sexual
censorship? (Where? For Whom?)

How obvious is a boundary between the Oral and the Written? Is it only one
boundary? In what places and times is such a boundary useful to draw? Who
needs it? For what purposes? This course is about the stories we tell about
such boundaries. It is about how unstable these boundaries, these notions--the
Oral, the Written--can be. In this course we will examine stories, tell
stories, write stories, interpret stories, change stories. Such stories are
about the movements of power: sex, race, class...gender, sexuality,
nationality...religion, revolution, representation. Whether we like it or not,
we are inside these stories. So, how do we seize the stories for ourselves?

The first half of the course will focus on feminist analysis of the internet
and the world wide web. We will learn how to use each as well as consider the
political meanings of feminist engagements with these writing processes. How
are they being used for feminist activism today, for whom, where and why? The
second half of the course will think about ways of writing in historical
terms. There I will share my current research projects, one on Quaker women's
writing on women's public speech in the 17th c. and the other on women's
writing on the world wide web as part of media fan communities. In each case
I'm concerned with how women write about what we think of as sexual issues, in
contexts in which the meanings of sexuality are very different. You will
create your own research project too, and we will share methods, issues and
meanings of changes in ways of writing.

_**Other Required Readings_** will also be available, some on the World Wide
Web, some on reserve at McKeldin, some available for xeroxing at Womens
Studies, and some handed out in class. We will read the entire text in some
cases, several chapters in others (*), and a single chapter in a few (**). All
materials have been ordered for reserve at McKeldin (which doesn't mean they
will necessarily be available immediately since some have to be located
first). I suggest you be strategic about which books you buy, which you share
with other students in class (please do this), and which you read on reserve.
You are responsible for readings even if materials ordered for reserve are not
yet there. Don't wait til the last minute to make arrangements for access to
materials, because they will not all be simply obtainable. You may have to
scout around a bit for access to some (especially if you don't buy them).

_**Computer Resources Required:_**  
You will need to be on email and check it regularly for class assignments and
notices on our class reflector (you can get a WAM account for email at the
Computer Center (CSS 1400) and use computer labs on campus). You will need to
get a GLUE account at the computer center too, so that you can learn how to
make a web page. Either WAM or GLUE accounts will allow you access to the Web,
and we will be looking at web sites as part of our investigations. RIGHT NOW
send email to Katie so she can set up reflector with your address. Send it to
kk15@umail.umd.edu and be sure to say what class you are in (since I have more
than one). If you don't know how to do this, ask a fellow student to help you
out, or talk to Katie immediately. (To get a GLUE account, telnet to
glue.umd.edu and login as "register" with the password of "register" and
follow the instructions. You will then have to take a picture ID to CSS 1400
to confirm the account. Tell them you need the account for this class.)

_**Summary of Assignments_**

Since this class meets only once a week, the assumption is that you will spend
MORE time than usual reading, writing and preparing for class. Ordinarily you
should budget 3 hrs of prep time for each hr of class time, so think
approximately 9 hrs prep time each week. (Some of which goes into graded
assignments. The more you work on these consistently each week too the better
you'll be able to budget your time conveniently.)  
_**(1) Consolidating computer resources for class:_** get GLUE and WAM
accounts, locate computer labs most convenient for your use if necessary, send
Katie email for class reflector, check reflector for first messages, and
evaluate web sites on handout. Find class support partner.  
_DUE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. Hand in note of completion._  
_**(2) Brief (1-2 pg. typed) reflection papers_** assigned during the semester
to bring into the next class. If you miss class you'll need to check with
another student to see if one has been assigned that day. These are a bit like
pop quizzes, and they show you are thinking about and keeping up with the
readings. The first reflection paper is assigned with a due date: "Reflections
on computer experiences." Say what you know how to do, what you've had
troubles with and why, what's fun, what isn't fun, what you refuse to do and
why, what you love and why, what equipment you have access to, what you wish
you could do.  
_DUE 4 February (1-2 pg typed)_  
_**(3) Creative paper on alternative writing technologies_** (may serve as
intro to final paper). To be edited by your partner.  
_DUE 25 February (3-5 pg. typed)_  
_**(4) Class report on form semester project will take_** (may create partner
project or keep pairs for mutual support). Should include discussion of
pivotal web sites.  
_DUE 11 March (5 min. oral report in class; written example to hand out)_  
_**(5) Class report on progress on semester project._** Should include
discussion of web sites.  
_DUE 15 April (10 min. oral report in class; written example to hand out)_  
_**(6) Finished semester major paper with learning analysis appendix_** (may
be collaborative or partners edit each others work). May be connected to a
student designed web site.  
_DUE 13 May (approx. 20 pg. paper)_

both class reports together, 25% grade  
final project, 25% grade

_**Reading and Project Assignments_**

_**January 28--Introduction to Women on the Web_**  
We'll start off the class by reading together "Women using the Net today" in
Senjen (21-37), and creating a list of assumptions violated by the readings.
Listing violated assumptions is one way to analyze the common sense knowledges
we've believed without questioning. What associations do we have with women,
computers, writing, feminism and activism?

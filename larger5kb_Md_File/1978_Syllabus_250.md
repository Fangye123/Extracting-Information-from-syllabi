**DESCRIPTION:**  
This course is designed to introduce students to the sociological study of
delinquent and criminal behavior. In doing so, the course is divided into
three substantive areas. First, we will examine the major theoretical
explanations for crime and delinquency, paying particular attention to the
specific sociological theories designed to help us understand why people
participate in delinquency and crime. Second, we will examine the state of
delinquent and criminal behavior in the United States. This section will
explore "who does what to whom?" (i.e. what are the major offenses committed?
who typically commits these offenses? who are the typical victims of these
offenses?) Finally, we will examine the scope of the criminal and juvenile
justice process. This section will focus on the historical development of
these two systems, as well as take a contemporary look at the steps and
consequences of both juvenile and criminal justice in the United States.

**OBJECTIVES:**  
1\. To understand the major sociological theories which explain delinquent and
criminal behavior and be able to use them to organize and understand empirical
evidence.  
2\. To understand the landscape of contemporary American delinquency and
criminality through an empirical (versus sensational) examination of crime
statistics.  
3\. To understand both the historical and contemporary workings of the
juvenile and criminal justice system.  
4\. To comprehend more thoroughly the assumptions and rational behind the
varieties of responses to delinquent and criminal behavior (i.e. punishment,
retribution, and rehabilitation).  

**REQUIREMENTS FOR THE COURSE: (SUBJECT TO CHANGE FOR FUTURE SEMESTERS)**  
**_Required Books:_**  

  * Costanzo, Mark. 1996. _Just Revenge: Costs and Consequences of the Death Penalty._ New York: St. Martin's Press.
  * Pollock-Byrne, Joycelyn M. _Women, Prison and Crime._ New York: Brooks/Cole Publishing.
  * Reiman, Jeffrey. 1990. _The Rich Get Richer and the Poor Get Prison: Ideology, Class, and Criminal Justice._ New York: Allyn and Bacon.
  * Staples, William G. _The Culture of Surveillance: Discipline and Social Control in the United States._ New York: St. Martin's Press.

**_Student Responsibilities:_**  
Students are not potted plants, and I expect full student commitment and
participation in this learning experience. You will notice that only a portion
of this course is lecture based. Every class period has a "seminar" portion
during which we will discuss the reading material or a film. For seminars over
the reading material, I expect you to come to class having read and prepared
the readings for discussion. I dislike "free riders," and thus reserve the
right to resort to pop quizzes if it becomes apparent that people are not
doing the reading before class.

**_Exams:_**  
We will have three unit exams for this course. Each exam is listed on the
course schedule, and will be worth 100 points. You can expect that the exams
will be a combination of multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-blank, and
essay questions. I am not a proponent of making exams a guessing game, so I
will distribute a study guide not less than one week prior to each scheduled
exam. Exam questions will be drawn directly from this study guide. THE FINAL
EXAM IS NOT COMPREHENSIVE.

**_Group Research Project:_**  
In addition to the exams, you are required to do a group research project on a
topic related to a contemporary issue in juvenile or criminal justice. This
project may utilize existing research that can be found in _academic_ journals
or you may do original research by collecting your own data. Each group should
select a topic for research by February 25 and submit a brief (one page)
proposal outlining the major research question the group would like to
explore. As noted on the syllabus, I will be meeting with each group
throughout the semester. On the last day of class (May 13), each group will
present its project to the entire class (30 minutes maximum per group).

Your group project will be evaluated along two fronts. First, you will have an
opportunity to evaluate and be evaluated by the other members of your project
group. Second, I will evaluate the group project as it is presented to the
class. Group projects will be worth a total of 100 points per student.

**_Grading:_**  
Final grades will be based on the cumulative points from the five exams and
mini-lab assignments, and will be assigned, as noted below, on a straight 10
percent scale, with 60 percent passing. There is no extra credit available for
this course.

90% and above.............A 80-89%.........................B
70-79%.........................C 60-69%.........................D 59% and
below.............F

**OTHER INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE:**  

**_Availability:_**  
My scheduled office hours are for you, and I hate sitting alone during my
office hours. I look forward to and encourage meeting with students during
these times. If my office hours do not meet your schedule, however, please
feel free to make an appointment with me at another time. I am also available
via the internet (swart@inst.augie.edu). If you need to get in touch with me
outside of my office hours and do not have access to the internet, feel free
to call my office (336-5329) and leave a message if I'm not available.

**_Persons with Disabilities:_**  
If you have any sort of disability or personal problem which prevents the
fullest expression of your abilities, please let me know as soon as possible
during the semester - _before_ it interferes with your work - so that I can
make a reasonable accommodation to your needs.

**_A Note About Due Dates:_**  
Due dates for this course are FIRM, and I expect you to turn in assignments
and take the exams during the scheduled class period. This policy will be
strictly enforced throughout the semester. Excuses for turning in late
assignments or taking a make-up exams will be considered on an individual
basis, and only when supported with the appropriate documentation. You bear
the sole responsibility for turning your work in on time.

**_Academic Misconduct:_**  
Students should abide by all student regulations as stated in the Augustana
College Catalog and the Student Handbook, especially those rules pertaining to
**_cheating_** and **_plagiarism_**. Plagiarism, cheating, or any other form
of academic dishonesty will not be tolerated in this course. Any student
engaging in academic dishonesty in this course can expect a failing grade for
the course _and_ formal charges to be brought before the Dean.

>  
> Various institutions regulate or oversee the regulation and application of
accounting methods. These institutions include governmental institutions, such
as Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS); private institutions, such as the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB); and other regulatory bodies, such as the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission. Because of the widespread influence of these
institutions, this course examines the institutional, regulatory, and legal
environment that affects accounting. To enter the profession of accountancy,
students must develop an understanding of these institutions. In addition,
they also must understand how to ascertain and apply the accounting standards
and regulations issued by these institutions. Finally, to facilitate this
understanding, students must develop applied research skills using library
services and computerized search systems.

>

> Upon completion of this course, the student should have an understanding of
the role of regulation in accounting and the role of accounting in regulation.
Students will be familiar with conducting applied research across a number of
accounting contexts. This course is intended to assist the student in
professional preparation. Thus, the development of communication skills,
analytical and problem-solving skills, and technical accounting skills will be
stressed.

>

> **CLASS ROUTINE:**

>

> Class sessions will be conducted using lectures, discussions, active
learning exercises, and student presentations. Students are expected to
prepare for each class meeting by studying the assigned reading material,
completing the homework assigned, and preparing to participate fully in class
discussions and learning exercises. In group assignments, all members are
expected to contribute equally.

>

> **Poor Performance in this class is generally linked to inadequate
preparation for class meetings.**

>

> **STUDENT GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES**

>

> Students must attempt to resolve their problems through discussion with the
instructor. Prior to meeting with the instructor, the student must submit to
the instructor a brief written description of the grievance.

>

> **GRADING CRITERIA:**

>

> The final grade earned in this course will be based on the components listed
below. A separate grading scale will be developed for each of these
components. The final grade for the course will be based on the sum of the
points earned on these components applied to a final grade scale, which will
be, at least, as generous as the sum of the grading scales from each of the
individual components. The maximum points for each of these components are as
follows:

>

>

> A grade of zero will be assigned to anyone who fails to submit an assignment
on time or misses a quiz without prior permission from the instructor. There
will be no make-ups for missed assignments.

>

> All written assignments must be typed (or computer printed), double-spaced,
with one inch margins, using a 10 or 12 character per inch font. Maximum
lengths for each assignment will be designated.

>

> Group projects will be assigned to groups of students determined by the
instructor. Groups will vary across each individual project and peer
evaluations will be used to determine each member's contribution to the group
project.

>

> Class participation will be partially based on peer evaluations.

>

> **A hallmark of the accountancy profession is integrity and honesty.**

>

> **ACADEMIC DISHONESTY WILL NOT BE TOLERATED!**

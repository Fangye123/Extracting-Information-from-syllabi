####  About this class

_Course description:_ Characteristics of modern computers and their
applications; analysis and solution of problems; structured programming
techniques; introduction to classes, abstract data types and object-oriented
programming; implementation of solutions in C++. Prerequisite: high school
algebra. _4 qtr hrs._

This is the first course in the computer science and applied computing degree
programs. The programming skills you learn and/or reinforce in COMP 1671/1672
will be used again and again in subsequent computer science courses.

Computers seem to be getting easier to use each year, but the tradeoff is that
programming rules and conventions (the APIs, or "application program
interfaces") are becoming increasingly complex. The C++ programming language
and its companion standard library fit this pattern well: there are very short
C++ programs that exhibit rich and useful behavior, but it will take some time
to learn how to write them and why they work as they do.

_Please note:_ this will be a very demanding course!

You are _not required_ to purchase any software, but it will enable you to do
your programming assignments on your own computer. All of the PC labs in John
Greene Hall already have the software, and you can to do your homework there.

Class and lab attendance is mandatory.  We will usually not take attendance,
but beware: we tend to notice when you miss class, and we are not eager to
repeat ourselves unnecessarily.

####  Grading

Grades measure accomplishment, not effort or enthusiasm.  Some people will
have to work very hard for their grades, and others won't.  That's life!
Homeworks | 20%  
---|---  
Quizzes | 60%  
Final Exam | 20%  
  
As you can see, most of your grade is determined by the nine Friday quizzes.
Your quiz grade will be computed as the average of your six best quiz scores.,
i.e., your three lowest scores will be dropped.  There will be no make-up
quizzes.  Each quiz will be taken from the reading assignment up to and
including the Wednesday preceding the quiz, and to a lesser extent, from
material recently discussed in class.

The course schedule will probably slip, but I will try to keep the web page
current.  So if you use an old schedule, you might end up reading more than
you have to for the quiz.

The homework assignments will mostly be computer programs.

The final exam will be like the quizzes only much, much longer.

Programming Guidelines

Keep the following points in mind when working on a programming assignment.

  * The program you turn in must work correctly (or almost correctly).  A program with syntax errors in it will not earn very much credit.
  * If your program compiles but works only partially then you will receive only partial credit.  However, if you write a note describing some circumstances in which such a program fails, your score may improve due to this evidence of testing and awareness on your part.
  * Don't copy other people's programs.  See the Collaboration section below.
  * Your program must be formatted sensibly for a human reader.  Remember, you are writing for three audiences: the compiler _and_ the legions of programmers who will have to maintain your code decades after you're fired (more likely, after you find a better job and desert) _and_ us.   You should not hold a grudge against these programmers, and it's in your interest to make your program easy for us to read.
  * One simple thing you can do is use MS VC++'s auto-formatting feature.  Select all of the text in a source file (Ctrl-A) and press Alt-F8, and it will indent everything nicely.  Poorly indented code is very hard to read: please don't turn it in or ask us to comment on it.  Just get in the habit of reindenting frequently.
  * You should also add comments that help guide an experienced C++ programmer through your code.  The need for this will become more apparent in later programs.
  * Include your name in a comment at the beginning of the source code.
  * Please do not create global variables! If you don't know what these are, then you're safe -- until you learn about them and are tempted to create some. 

####

* * *

Deadlines

Hand-in assignments are due at the beginning of the class period on the due
date.  I am sometimes willing to change a deadline for a particular assignment
if I am asked in advance, but I rarely approve last-minute extension requests:
these are just announcements that a deadline has been missed.

So, unexcused late assignments will be assessed a penalty of 20% or more
depending on the circumstances. That hurts, so don't do it.

####

* * *

Collaboration

You are invited to collaborate on the programming assignments.  You may plan
strategies together, help each other with debugging, etc.  However, when you
turn in a program with your name on it, you implicitly claim authorship.

The following rule of thumb may help: there's no legitimate reason for you to
possess electronic or hard copies of anyone else's partial or full solutions
to problems resembling assignments in this class.  "Writing programs together"
is not allowed.  But whatever you can carry in your head after a conversation
is something you have rightfully learned and may use with confidence.

By analogy, it's fine to discuss your reactions to The Scarlet Letter with
your American Literature classmates, but when it comes time to write the book
report, you must write it yourself.  "Writing book reports together" is not
allowed.  This does not forbid you to seek minor assistance with spelling or
grammar, and it does not forbid you from being profoundly influenced by
someone else's viewpoint.

####

* * *

Academic Honesty

The _minimum_ penalty I assign for violations of the Academic Honor Principle
(see the student handbook under "Rights and Responsibilities") is an F for the
course.   For more blatant offenses, I will also refer the case to the dean
for possible probation, suspension, or expulsion.

Any attempt to mislead in an academic communication is a violation of the
honor principle.  You should already know what plagiarism is; if you don't you
risk failing the course summarily.  Turning in a program you didn't write is
misleading, peeking at someone else's quiz is misleading, and "tidying up"
(falsifying) program output after the fact is misleading.  There is no way to
list all possible offenses.

	This course is a general introduction to the teaching profession. Topics
	covered include motivation, status, and preparation of teachers; educational
	careers; requirements for teacher certification; supply and demand; social
	expectations; professional organizations; policies governing education at
	the local, state, and federal levels; educational finance; elementary, middle
	school, and secondary school curricula; computers in education; multicultural
	and international education; and effective teaching practices and educational
	research. Students are engaged in discussions of their view of teaching vis
	a vis textbook readings and field observations; and asked to think critically,
	and make classroom presentations about specific educational issues. Each
	student is expected to complete ten observation hours in elementary and secondary
	schools, and cultural centers, and complete a field observation report.
	

	Course Objectives:
	

	1. Understand some of the basic tenets of the teaching profession, including
	entry, retention, and advancement requirements; status and motivation of
	teachers; professional organizations; and policies governing educational
	practice at the local, state, and federal levels.
	
	2. Become aware of existing teaching practices in the United States and abroad,
	including the organization of elementary, middle school, and high school
	curricula; learning "outcomes;" and the implementation of computer education.

	goals, methods, and curricula in public elementary and secondary schools,
	and related educational facilities, including writing of field observation
	reports.
	
	4. Understand the multicultural dimensions and mandates of American public
	schools, including addressing the learning needs of a diverse student body
	
	5. Develop the ability to think critically about current educational issues
	by analyzing advantages and disadvantages of certain educational approaches
	during class discussions and presentations, .
	

	*In this course, we will not cover in any significant detail either the
	historical or philosophical foundations of education. Historical and
	Philosophical Foundations of Education, which are substantial, are examined

	Required Texts:

	Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1999.
	

	Incompletes Policy
	

	Only students who are receiving a grade of C or better (=70 points minimum)
	are eligible for an incomplete at the time they request it. This means they
	should have accumulated at least 70 points even to be considered for an
	Incomplete, except in extenuating circumstances, such as, hospitalization,
	or the like, where the student had no control over the situation. Students
	should have had an excellent attendance record, and a valid reason of why
	they should be offered an incomplete, before one can be assigned. The instructor
	does not consider the need to read over the required reading assignments,
	or more time to complete any of the other class requirements, as valid reasons.
	

	Recommendation Letters
	

	As a general rule, recommendation letters will not be completed by the instructor
	before the student has completed all requirements for the course, and has
	been assigned a final grade.
	

	Attendance Policy:
	

	For each hour a student has been absent, he/she loses 1 point. To have an
	absence excused, a student must have a legitimate excuse, including a written
	statement from a health professional, qualified employer, and the like. Students
	who walk in class after attendance has been taken, will be marked "tardy."
	Three tardy marks are equivalent to 1 absence point. Students who are tardy
	should notify the instructor at the end of the class period of their presence,
	so that they will not be marked absent. Students should attend class for
	at least 30 minutes per 50 minutes of class time to be marked as either tardy
	or present. Otherwise, they will be marked "absent." For example, students
	who leave right after attendance is taken will be marked absent. According
	to the Official Academic Regulations regarding Class Attendance in the
	Undergraduate Catalogue, students with more than 4 hourly absences from class
	may be dropped from the course by the instructor.
	

	Rules Regarding Classroom Decorum:
	

	1. No eating in the classroom.
	
	2. No children are allowed to attend. Please find alternative child care
	facilities for your child(ren).
	
	3. Noone who is not officially registered is allowed to attend.
	
	4. No form of disruptive behavior will be tolerated.
	

	Students who break the above rules may be asked to leave the classroom.

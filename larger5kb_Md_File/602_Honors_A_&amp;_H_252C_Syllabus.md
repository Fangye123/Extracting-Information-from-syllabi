Learning Objectives: ![Back to the Top](toparrow.gif)
    It was during the course of the European Middle Ages that Western Civilization forged a distinctive identity for itself out of a dynamic interaction between the ideal and the real, myth and memory, romance and history. This course will examine the way in which personal, national, ethnic, religious and other kinds of identity are generated out of a conversation between history and the great works of Western literature. This course invites you to participate in that continuing conversation, to ask the questions: how do we know who we are? How have people made decisions about their identity, and with what consequences? Why are the politics of identity so important in the modern world, and how did it get that way. If the identity of great civilizations is a reflection of (or reflected in) its great literature, what works should be included in that canon, and how have people made these decisions; how should we?     This course is intended to serve as a forum for discussing these questions. It is also intended to introduce students to the historical context of these works, and to the challenge of understanding these works as historical sources. Course Requirements: ![Back to the Top](toparrow.gif)
    

  1. **Lectures.** There will be a minimum of lecture in this class, but it will be crucial. The intent of the lectures is to provide a historical context for each of the works under discussion; and to suggest possible lines of inquiry to guide your reading. Regular attendance and note-taking will be essential for there will be no general text-book to provide this context.   
  

  2. **Discussions.** Since this course is conceived of as a seminar, our discussions will not be an optional extra, but an absolutely essential element of the course and your participation is therefor mandatory. This participation can take a variety of forms. In addition to offering comments and observations in discussion, you might also engage in some substantive discussion of the coursework on the class [ discussion list ](http://catalyst.washington.edu/webtools/epost/register.cgi?owner=jjcrump&id=1708). Or you might offer the class a brief presentation on a related subject of particular interest to you. Another possibility might be to take seriously my suggestion that this course is a work in progress and contribute additional elements to it which could be offered to your colleagues via the web: some annotated bibliography, perhaps, on a related subject of interest. There are a variety of ways to meet this requirement. You should give some thought to it and discuss it with me.   
  

  3. **Reading.** As this is a "Great Books" course, the most important requirement of all will, of course, be to READ. Equally important, however, will be to THINK about what you read. To this end, you will keep a [journal or reading log](journal.html) which will contain whatever informal reactions to the readings you might have, as well as a series of short (2-3 page) [response papers](journal.html): one for each text. I will suggest topics for these short papers, or you may write on topics of your own choosing. I will ask to see these journals two or three times during the quarter and they will be turned in for evaluation on the last day of class (Thursday March 14).   
  

  4. **Writing.** Any of these short response papers may be expanded into one longer paper of five to seven pages devoted to an analysis of any one of the assigned texts that you may choose. This paper will require some additional research and should focus upon the historical context of the work in question. Your thesis should contain an argument showing how the selected work contributed to the development of some sense of identity. This paper will be turned in on the last day of class (Thursday March 14).   
  

  5. **Grading.** There are four graded requirements for this course:  
  

    1. Thoughtful participation in classroom discussions (20% of course grade) 
    2. Reading Journal (30% of course grade). 
    3. Term paper of 5-7 pages (20% of course grade). 
    4. Final Exam (30% of course grade).  
Nota Bene: You must attempt and complete _ALL FOUR_ of these assignments in
order to receive credit for the course.        Instructor Availability ![Back

which you will find on the internet at this address [
http://personal2.stthomas.edu/gwschlabach/docs/city.htm
](http://personal2.stthomas.edu/gwschlabach/docs/city.htm). These were very
helpfully selected and arranged by Gerald Schlabach, an associate professor of

**Further Research:** For those who want to pursue Augustine's confessions
further, let me recommend the works of James O'Donnell. Check him out here: [

**Discussion/Paper topic:** Here's a question for you to consider as you read
Beowulf and, if you so choose, to serve as a subject for this week's response
paper. What is a king in Beowulf's world? Who serves him and why? And what has
history to do with a king's identity?  
Week III![Back

to the Top](toparrow.gif)

     Tues. Jan. 22 |  **Discussion:** Beowulf  
**Further Research:** Since I made a point on Friday about just how mysterious
Beowulf really is, you might want to have a look at a web site devoted to the
preservation and understanding of the manuscript itself:
[http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBeowulf/main.htm"](http://www.uky.edu/~kiernan/eBeowulf/main.htm)  
 **Further Research:** Also, check out the ongoing [discussion on
ANSAX-L](beowulf.html) on some of the topics that were raised in our

passage from Heloise, A Biography by Enic McLeod (London, 1938) In which she
translates a very interesting Breton folk-song describing Heloise as some sort
of sorceress or Druidic priestess. You will also find here the 19th century

into the French.

Machiavelli has a very great deal to say about "The Prince". Can we

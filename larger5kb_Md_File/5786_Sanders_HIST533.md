**INTRODUCTION**

Dear Students:

Welcome to HISTORY 533, The Civil War! In this course we will study the era
which, in my admittedly biased opinion, is the most important and interesting
in American history. Your study of the American Civil War in this course will
be exciting as well as informative. This course will not be a review of dry
and lifeless facts. As will become evident from your readings and your
viewings of the videotapes, this is a period of much drama, humor and sadness.
It is a time of great achievements and unspeakable horrors. In short, it is
the era of our nation's most staggering trials and its greatest triumphs. The
combination of readings and tapes selected for this course will offer you that
type of history which Bruce Catton has described as "history with the blood in
it." The objective of this sort of history is to capture the "feel" of the era
as well as the "facts."

The best formula for obtaining the most from this course (to include a
satisfactory grade) is quite simple - be an active participant in every
component. As is the case in all distance learning classes, what you get out
of this course will be determined largely by the effort you put into it. The
tapes from the Ken Burns series are excellent, and the assigned readings have
been selected specifically to compliment and expand upon the subjects each of
the tapes addresses. If you fully apply yourself in the completion of the
assignments, I can assure you that you will gain not only a detailed knowledge
of the major characters and events of the war, but also an understanding of
how the history of this era continues to influence our nation today. I look
forward to our study together.

Sincerely,

Charles W. Sanders, Jr.  
Department of History  
Kansas State University

**Course Description:**

In this course we will study the ideas and events that led to the American
Civil War, the progress of the conflict, and its economic, social and
political legacy. The course will contrast the differences in the societies of
the antebellum North and South, determine how these differences resulted in
secession and war, and explore the major events and personalities of that
devastating ordeal. The video series captures the entire sweep of the war,
from the battlefields to the homefronts, and from the opening shots at Ft.
Sumter to the stillness at Appomattox. The programs address not only the
familiar topics of the war, but, through the use of such sources as personal
diaries, letters and newspaper accounts, clearly demonstrate how the conflict
impacted the lives of ordinary Americans of the era.

**Prerequisites:**

The completion of at least one undergraduate survey course covering the
history of the United States through 1865 is strongly recommended. Students
must be able to complete substantial reading requirements independently and
compose detailed written reviews of assigned works.

**Pre-course survey:**

Enclosed in the forms section of this packet is a pre-course survey. Please
complete the form and return it promptly in the business reply envelope
provided. This information will be forwarded to your instructor, who will use
it to get acquainted with you.

**Textbooks:**

Required:

_Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era_ , James McPherson, First Ed., 1989,
N.Y. Ballentine Books.

_Major Problems in the Civil War and Reconstruction_ , Michael Perman, ed.,
1991, Lexington, MA: DC Heath & Co.

_The Civil War Telecourse Study Guide_ , Staff of WETA, First Ed., 1990, WETA.

Optional:

_Ten Lessons in Clarity and Grace_ , Joseph Williams, 5th edition, 1997,
Scott, Foresman.

**Grading policy:**

One of the first things most students want to know about a new course is how
their grade will be determined. In this course, grades will be assigned
according to the following scale:

A = 90-100 points  
B = 80-90 points  
C = 70-80 points  
D = 60-70 points  
F = 0-59 points Individual course requirements will be weighted as follows:

Review 1: 15%  
Review 2: 15%  
Review 3: 15%  
Mid-Term Examination: 25%  
Final Examination: 30%

**Proctor requirements:**

A proctor agreement form is enclosed in the Forms section of this packet. It
is your responsibility to locate your own proctor. The following people would
be appropriate to select as proctors: public school or community college
teachers or administrators, librarians, counselors at public schools or
community colleges or universities. Please do not ask a personal friend or
relative to serve as your proctor. Proctors who do not fit the above
description will be refused.

When you have located a proctor, have that person complete and sign the
proctor agreement and return it to our office using the enclosed business
reply envelope. Students living in Manhattan, Kansas or within a 30 mile
radius will need to make arrangements to take their exams in the Distance
Learning Office. Special weekend and evening times can be arranged.

**Testing:**

There will be two examinations in this course. Both will be essay examinations
in which students will be required to provide answers to specific questions.
Students will be provided a number of questions from which they will select a
specified number on which to write. Tests will be sent directly to your
proctor to arrive approximately one week prior to the due date listed in the
Reading, Writing, and Viewing section of this packet.

Your proctor will give you the test in his/her presence and will then return
it to us in the envelope provided. Allow time for the instructor to grade it
before calling. Receipt of the exams will be announced by the instructoe on
the class electronic list as will the grading and returnm schedule.

**Returning student examinations and reviews:**

All examinations and student reviews will be returned to the student within
two weeks after receipt. Students will receive a numerical score, a letter
grade for the exercise, and comments from the instructor.

**Written assignments:**

I have endeavored to keep the assignments as reasonable as possible, but, as
in all upper-level courses, the work required is substantial. Some weeks the
assignments are heavier than others. Study the schedule and plan ahead. Note
especially the due dates for your reviews. I strongly suggest that you select
the three books you wish to review and obtain them immediately. Each of the
books listed below should be available in your local libraries or book stores.
If a book you wish to review is not available, ask if your library can arrange
a timely interlibrary loan.

Make sure you submit your written requirements on time. All requirements must
be postmarked by the date indicated. This is necessary if I am to provide you
a timely evaluation of your work. Those assignments which are postmarked after
the assigned date will incur a penalty. Five points will be deducted for each
day you exceed the assigned postmark date. For example, the first review must
be postmarked not later than 15 September. If it is postmarked 17 September,
ten points will be deducted from the grade the student earns on the review.
Take care to submit all your assignments on time!

1\. **Review #1:** Must be postmarked no later than **15 September**.

Students will select one of the following works to read and review:

Kenneth Stampp, _America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink_ (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1990).

Stephen B. Oates, _The Approaching Fury: Voices of the Storm, 1820-1861_ (New
York: Harper Collins, 1997).

Kenneth Stampp, _The Causes of the Civil War_ (New York: Simon and Schuster,
1986).

David M. Potter, _The Impending Crisis, 1848-1861_ (New York: Harper and Row,
1976).

2\. **Review #2:** Must be postmarked no later than **9 October**.

Students will select one of the following works to read and review:

Stephen W. Sears, _Landscape Turned Red: The Battle of Antietam_ (Boston:
Houghton Mifflin, 1983).

William Marvel, _Andersonville: The Last Depot_ (Chapel Hill: The University
of North Carolina Press, 1994).

Noah Andre Trudeau, _Bloody Roads South: The Wilderness to Cold Harbor, May-
June 1864_ (Boston: Little Brown and Company, 1989).

John J. Hennessy, _Return to Bull Run: The Campaign and Battle of Second
Manassas_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1993).

3\. **Mid-Term exam: 22 October**.

4\. **Review #3:** Must be postmarked NLT **17 November**.  
Students will select one of the following works to read and review:

Robert Brent Toplin, editor, _Ken Burn's `The Civil War': Historians Respond_
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1996).

David Herbert Donald, _Lincoln_ (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1995).

William C. Davis, _Jefferson Davis: The Man and His Hour_ (New York: Harper
Collins, 1991).

5. **Final Exam: 10 December**.

Reviews are to be at least 1,500 words in length, typed and double- spaced.
Please remember that the assignment does not call for a book report. Simply
recounting the contents of the work will not satisfy this requirement. There
are a number of ways reviews might be constructed, but, in general terms, the
first third of your essay should summarize the events covered in the book. The
second third should state clearly the main arguments and interpretations of
the author and the evidence he supplies to support his case. The final third
should be your assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the book. Are the
arguments and interpretations the author presents convincing? Is the evidence
he offers sufficient to make his case? Are there other arguments or
interpretations that are more plausible? Does the book have other particular
strengths or weaknesses, such as editing, maps, appendixes or charts?

In composing your reviews, I suggest you consult examples of book reviews in
such academic journals as _The Journal of American History, The Journal of
Southern History, The Journal of Military History, American Historical Review_
or the journal published by the state historical society of your state.

**Library services:**

As a distance learning student, you are entitled to K-State library services,
even though you can not come to the campus. If you need library services or
materials, a staff person in KSU's Academic Services will assist you in using
resources such as:

    * performing searches of periodical indexes and abstracts and bibliographic services  

    * retrieving, copying, and delivering specified articles or government documents (user will pay for copying and mailing)  

    * checking out books and assisting with other kinds of library access  

    * providing information on library use specifically tailored for off-campus students.

If you did not receive your Library Services Information packet with these
materials, contact the Distance Learning Office at 1-800-622-2KSU and one will
be sent.

**Videotapes:**

This course includes nine videotaped episodes. Please follow the Reading,
Writing, Viewing and Listening Assignment section, which describes the
integration of readings, videotapes, reviews, teleconferences and
examinations.

Included in this package is a complete set of materials. All tapes for this
course must be returned to the Distance Learning Office by the end of the
semester before a grade for the course will be issued.

**Computer conferencing and electronic mail:**

This course requires the use of computer conferencing (listserv) and
electronic mail. By use of computer conferencing, we will create an
"electronic classroom" which allows students and faculty to interact in a
timely manner without being bound to a specific meeting day and time. Through
the use of a computer, modem, and software, students are able to send and
receive electronic mail to faculty and other students; participate in the
computer conferencing listserv for the course; submit assignments via
electronic file transfers; and use on-line library catalogs and information
service. With the aid of electronic mail, we envision highly interactive
problem-solving dialogues among isolated learners across the country.

This "electronic community" will be further strengthened through live audio
teleconferences to provide advising, additional course information and review
for exams. See additional information on teleconferencing in this packet.

**Getting on-line:**

Students can sign-up for the KSU Unix system or subscribe to a local computer
Internet access service in their area. Some of the better known services are
America On-Line, Prodigy, and CompuServe, and there may be other local
services also available in you area. Shop around to get the best price.

Access to e-mail through the KSU central Unix system data switches is
available via personal computer and modem. This service is available at no
charge to students (students pay own long distance telephone charges) but does
require a Unix user ID and password also at no cost. (See user ID and password
information below.)

Phone numbers for the KSU Unix system data switches for e-mail access only
are: 913-532-7770, 2-7780, 2-5370, or 2-5390.

For students needing or wanting access to graphics and other multimedia on the
Internet and World Wide Web, additional access and support is needed.
Information on KSU services and costs are included in the "Dial-In Service at
K- State" brochure. You can receive a copy of this brochure by calling
1-800-622- 2KSU.

**User ID and password:**

If you elect to use KSU's services instead of a commercial service, you will
need a User ID and password to access the KSU Unix system. To receive a user
ID and password complete and return the KSU On-Line Systems Access Request
form in the forms section of this packet.

**Modems:**

Recognizing that some students are not electronic mail users and may not have
access to modems, a limited supply of modems are available for rent during the
length of the course. The modems are IBM compatible and rent for $25. If you
need to rent a modem, complete and return the KSU On-Line Systems Access
Request form in the forms section of this packet.

**Listserv:**

As noted above, an electronic discussion group (listserv) has been created to
provide timely communication between the student and instructor and among
students. All students must subscribe and participate actively on this
listserv.

This will be our primary form of communication, and will be used to transmit
assignments, course schedule changes, class discussions, and other vital
information. Only through use of the listserv will students be able to keep
abreast of activities in the course.

The service is simple to use with only a minimum of practice. The following
page titled "Using a Listserv Mailing List" explains how you subscribe
yourself to the listserv and additional information on how to retrieve
archives and e-mail etiquette.

**Teleconferences:**

The instructor has set up three discussion and review sessions during the
semester. These sessions will be from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM, CST.

**Fall, 1997 Teleconferences**  
27 September  
25 October  
06 December

I expect all students to participate in each of the three sessions. I have
deliberately kept the number of texts you will be required to purchase low so
as to balance out the expense you will incur as a result of the
teleconferences. Informed participation by each student is required. If you
have studied the videotapes and the readings, you will be prepared.

To participate in these sessions, call 1-913-532-5001 and inform the operator
that you are calling to participate in the HIST 533: The Civil War review
session.

Following are guidelines to make this a positive learning experience:  
1) Use a telephone in a quiet location. Background noise can interfere with
the conference call quality for all participants.

2) Call the conference operator a few minutes ahead of the scheduled time.
Your call will be answered by music followed by the conference operator. You
will be asked to stand by until the class begins. Remember that all times are
for the central time zone.

3) If you have line noise that interferes with your reception, please hang up
and place your call again.

4) If you have trouble getting through to the number above, please call the
back-up number (785) 532-5995.

Participating in these sessions (by teleconference or on-campus) is your
responsibility. Obviously I feel that the content of the meetings is
important, or else the sessions would not be scheduled. The benefits to you
are substantial:

1) a guaranteed time to reach the instructor;

2) an opportunity to talk with other students in the class, to feel part of a
group, to overcome some of the isolation that comes with learning at a
distance; and

3) timely and intensive review.

Students who are unable to come to the on-campus sessions or participate by
telephone need to call the Distance Learning Office at (785)532-5686 or toll
free at 1-800-622-2KSU to make other arrangements.

**On-campus sessions:**

Students on-campus and within driving distance are encouraged to come on-
campus to participate in these sessions. They will be held in the TELENET
classroom in Dole Hall on the Kansas State University campus at the same dates
and times as listed in the Teleconference section above.

**COURSE OUTLINE:**

**Learning objectives:**

History 533 is designed to accomplish the following objectives:

1\. Examine the characteristics of the antebellum North and South and
determine how and why the two sections had "grown apart" in the years prior to
the war.

2\. Determine why and how the social, political and economic differences
between the two sections culminated in the Civil War.

3\. Establish the chronology of the war, analyze the conduct and importance of
its key military campaigns, and examine the major military and civilian
personalities who directed and participated in them.

4\. Explore the important political events in both sections during the war and
establish how the societies of the North and the South were transformed by the
conflict.

5\. Determine the legacy of the war and its importance in the history of the
United States.

**Reading, Writing, and Viewing Assignments:**

This is the planned course schedule. Any changes will be announced in advance
via the class electronic list.

As indicated above, I place great importance on the timely completion of
assignments and full participation in our three teleconference sessions. Note
especially the due dates for your reviews and the dates of the three
teleconference sessions. Study the schedule and plan ahead.

**UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES:**  

 **Time limit to complete course:**

You are enrolled in the Fall 1997 semester which ends December 19, 1997\. If
you realize that you cannot complete your coursework by the end of the
semester or term in which you are enrolled, you will need to make a formal
petition to your professor for a grade of "Incomplete." You will need to
complete the Petition for Incomplete form located in the forms section of this
packet, and submit it to the Distance Learning Office, Division of Continuing
Education, 231 College Court Building, Manhattan, KS 66506-6007, no later than
two weeks before the semester or term ends. Except when precluded by
documented emergencies, students are expected to complete the course on time.
A grade of Incomplete will be granted only in the most extreme circumstances.

The K-State Policy on Incompletes (I) states that unless the work is made up,
a grade of IX will replace the I at the end of the next semester in which the
student is enrolled. The IX will count as zero grade points (same as an F) for
calculation of the Grade Point Average. Blank or NR grades will be treated the
same way.

**Drop/status change policy:**

The last date to drop this course will be listed in the syllabus you recieve
in the mail. This is also the last date that any status change (i.e., credit
to non- credit) can be made. Students dropping the course or making status
changes must send written notification to the Distance Learning Office
postmarked no later than this date.

**Refund policy:**

Students may receive a full tuition refund if it is requested in writing
within 14 days of the date the initial materials were mailed. Students may
receive a 50 percent tuition refund if it is requested in writing within 30
days of the date the initial materials were mailed. No refund will be issued
if it is requested after 30 days. Additional fees are non-refundable (i.e.,
fees for books, handouts, or tapes fees).

**Transcript requests:**

Please allow four to six weeks after the official ending date of a course
before requesting a copy of your transcript. Transcripts may be requested from

complete the course requirements. You may not make any of our tapes available
to other people, unless you have our explicit written permission to share them
with certain individuals.

**ADA policy:**

The Kansas State University Division of Continuing Education is committed to
making courses accessible to all students. If you have any condition, such as
a physical or learning disability, which will make it difficult for you to
carry out the work as outlined or which will require academic accommodations,

**Student Statement on Plagiarism**

The Student Life Handbook of Kansas State University defines plagiarism as

1\. "Plagiarism is the academic and literary equivalent of robbery, taking
someone else's property. If you copy somebody's test answers, take an essay
from a magazine and pass it off as your own, lift a well-phrased sentence or
two and include them without crediting the author or using quotation marks, or
even pass off somebody's good ideas as examples of your own genius, you are
guilty of intellectual thievery. If you are caught you should expect
punishment or contempt or both." Robert M. Gorrell and Charlton Laird, _Modern
English Handbook_ , 6th edition, (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall,
1976), p. 71.

2\. Plagiarism covers unpublished as well as published sources; borrowing
another's term paper, handing in as one's own work a paper purchased from an
individual or agency, or submitting as one's own papers from a living group,
club or organization files, are all punishable as plagiarism.

To avoid plagiarism, the Student Life Handbook states that you should
"acknowledge indebtedness":

1\. Whenever you quote another person's actual words;

2\. Whenever you use another person's idea, opinion, or theory, even if it is
completely paraphrased in your own words; and

3\. Whenever you borrow facts, statistics, or other illustrative materials--
unless the information is common knowledge. William W. Watt, _An American
Rhetoric_ , 4th edition (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, Inc., 1970), p.
8.

If it is proven that you plagiarized a paper or exam at Kansas State
University, you will receive at a minimum an F for the plagiarized paper or
exam and an explanatory report will be put in your university file. If your
plagiarism was severe enough or if you plagiarize continually, you may be
dismissed from the University.

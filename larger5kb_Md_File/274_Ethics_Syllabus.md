**I. COURSE DESCRIPTION**

****

This is a course on ethical theory. Ethical theory is the study of the nature
of morality--the fundamental basis of moral rightness and moral wrongness. The
goal of this sort of inquiry is to gain a general or abstract understanding of
morality, rather than to determine whether particular activities are morally
permitted or prohibited. In pursuing this general understanding we will
consider some of the most pressing questions regarding morality: does morality
depend on religion? is morality objective or just a matter of opinion? are
there universal moral principles, or only local (culture-relative) ones? is
morality impartial, or do some people's interests (e.g., those of the agent)
count more? can actions be motivated by anything other than self-interest?
does the moral rightness or wrongness of an action depend on its consequences?
do the agent's intentions matter? are they all that matter? what does an
agent's character have to do with the moral status of his or her actions?
should character be the basic concern of morality rather than actions?

About the Requirements:

_

_Class Participation_ \--One thing this requirement covers is your _class
attendance_ (if you don't attend class you can't participate in it). However,
to get an "A" for class participation you must do more than just show up; you
have to contribute to class discussion. You are expected to show up having
read the assignment for the day and ready to talk about it.

_The Short Essay_ \--There will be a **2 page paper** due at the end of
January. The topics will be distributed in the second week of class. Papers
are due at the **beginning** of class on the due date. Late papers are subject
to a substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out how much).

_The First Paper_ \--There will be a **5-8 page paper** due around the
beginning of March. Topics will be distributed about 2 weeks before the paper
is due, and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date.
Again, late submission is not a good idea.

_The Second Paper_ \--There will be a second **5-8 page paper** due in late
April. Again, topics will be handed out about 2 weeks before the paper is due,
and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late
submission is still not a good idea.

_The Final Exam_ \--There will be a cumulative final exam given in class on
our last meeting, **Monday, April 30th**. The exam will consist of short
answer questions and essay questions based on the readings and lectures.

  
**

IV. CLASS FORMAT

**

The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want to encourage
discussion. I expect you all to show up having read the assignment for that
meeting and ready to use it as a point of departure. It is the nature of the
issues we will be considering that people's views will differ. You are
encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when anyone says something you
disagree with, but everyone should always keep in mind that disagreement is
not a personal attack. Philosophical discussion thrives under this kind of
interaction and often stems from disagreement. At the same time, philosophical
discussion _aims at_ reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't reach
agreement every time, but we should aspire toward it.

V. TOPICS AND READINGS

**

Most of the readings will be from the textbook. They are listed below by
author with their chapter numbers in parentheses. Readings from other sources
are labeled "photocopy" and are available at New University Copies located at
11 Waverly Place.

**A note about the readings:** Philosophical writing is often subtle and
difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking
that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read _at least
twice_. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second time
slowly while taking notes.

The course is divided into four units. Those units and the readings for them
are as follows.

1\. God, Culture, and Self-Interest

>  Feinberg, "Psychological Egoism" (27)

2\. Consequentialism  

> Bentham, from _An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation_
(11)  
>  Mill, from _Utilitarianism_ (12)  
>  Taylor, "The Diversity of Goods" (photocopy)  
>  Williams, "A Critique of Utilitarianism" (28)

>

> Ross, from _The Right and the Good_ (21)  
>  Brandt,  "Some Merits of One Form of Rule Utilitarianism" (25)

3\. Deontology  

> Kant, from _Fundamental Principles of the Metaphysics of Morals_ (10)  
>  Korsgaard,  "The Right to Lie: Kant on Dealing with Evil" (photocopy)  
>  Foot, "Morality As a System of Hypothetical Imperatives" (31)  
>  Nelson, "Kant's Moral Philosophy" (photocopy)  
>  Wolf, "Moral Saints" (38)

4\. Virtue Ethics

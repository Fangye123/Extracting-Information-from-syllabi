**Course Description**

_  In the fall of 1994, Time magazine published a list of events at which
George Bush had shed tears, and noted that Bill Clinton was even more prone to
cry in public. Sentimentality and the public display of emotion have often
been seen as feminine characteristics, and yet clearly there is a space in
American public life for men to be sentimental too. This course will examine
the representation of masculine emotions in American literature and culture in
the nineteenth century. Emotions are not natural, universal, and unchanging
things, we will discover, and they have served political and literary ends in
different historical periods. In the first unit of the course, we will explore
the politics of male emotion by asking questions such as: What did it mean for
George Washington to weep in public, as he did more than once? Why did
hundreds of working-class men gather in public meetings in the 1840s to weep
over their drunken debauchery, and why did Walt Whitman write his only novel
about this branch of the temperance movement? How did such emotions as pity
and sympathy function in literature by black and white authors, male and
female, devoted to the abolition of slavery? How did male writers like Ralph
Waldo Emerson, Frederick Douglass, and Nathaniel Hawthorne construct authority
in the midst of what critics have called "the sentimental years" or "the
feminine fifties?" In the second unit, we will closely examine selected
writings of Herman Melville, whose work has usually been characterized as
antithetical to sentimentality. These will include his novels _Pierre _and_
Billy Budd _, as well as some short stories. During that second unit, you will
also begin work on your final research project, a paper of 20-30 pages on a
topic of your own design. The final section of the course will be entirely
devoted to students' research projects, including individual presentations to
the class as a whole and group work on rough drafts._

**Course Requirements**

**_Readings_**

> You are expected to do all the required readings before the class in which
they are due.

**_Attendance and participation_**

25% of grade

> Regular attendance and active participation in class discussion are
essential to this course. You are also required to participate in a "virtual
discussion" on the course listserver. Its address is:
[ENGL481Z-01-FA00@listserv.nd.edu](mailto:ENGL481Z-01-FA00@listserv.nd.edu). A
[handout on posting to the list](http://www.nd.edu:80/~ghendler/SMGuide.html)
will arrive in your e-mail early in the term, but note that electronic
participation will count toward your participation grade. Everyone must have
posted at least one comment to the list by September 8\. I reserve the right
to add small electronic assignments over the course of the term.

_**Synopsis and critical questions** (2)_

12.5% of grade (each)

> In the second class meeting, pairs (or in some cases threesomes) of students
will sign up to be the "resource people" for each of the critical, historical,
and/or theoretical readings assigned over first two units of the term (marked
on the syllabus with an asterisk like so: ***** ). The same combination of
people may _not_ pair up twice. The resource people will do four things: (1)
Provide a written **_synopsis_** of the reading's argument; (2) Conclude that
synopsis with a set of written **_critical questions_** for the class to
discuss and debate. The total length of each writing assignment _should not
exceed 800 words_ (3) E-mail this page to the class listserver _at least 24
hours before the class meeting_ ,, which means by Monday or Wednesday at 1:15;
(4) Come to class prepared to be the focal point of discussion of their
written questions and the critical/theoretical reading they synopsized. I am
not asking anyone to give a formal presentation, or to lead the class
discussion; only to be the resource people or "experts" on that particular set
of ideas. The written part of this assignment will be graded on a pass/fail
basis; performance in class as resource people will be an important component
of the participation grade.

**_Final research project_**

50%

> You will also write one substantial research paper (20-30 pages) on a topic
of your design. The project will go through seven stages, all of which will be
factored into your grade:  **1)**[E-mail to me ](mailto:Hendler.1@nd.edu)a
**_1-2 page essay proposal_** consisting of a statement of your proposed
thesis, the main points you plan to make to support that thesis, an idea of
what kind of evidence you will need to find to back it up, and a preliminary
bibliography. I will get the proposals back to you promptly with comments and
suggestions on where to go from there. Once I've read the proposals, I will
break the class up into smaller workshop groups based on your paper topics.
**2)**[ E-mail to me](mailto:Hendler.1@nd.edu) a more detailed, annotated
bibliography, in which you briefly summarize each item on your bibliography
and describe its importance for your project. A good way to start looking for
sources for your bibliography is to [click
here](http://www.nd.edu:80/~ghendler/professional.html#Academic links).
**3)** [E-mail to me](mailto:Hendler.1@nd.edu) a preliminary draft of at least
the first 15 pages of your paper at least 48 hours before a scheduled
appointment with me,  and distribute it to the members of your workshop group
at least 48 hours before you meet with them.  **4)** Meetings with members of
your workshop group, in which each member has read the others' papers and
comes prepared to offer suggestions and constructive criticism.   **5)** An
individual meeting with me to discuss your draft.   **6)** Presentations of
your projects--still in progress--to the class as a whole. **7)** The final
draft of the paper is to be handed in to me at the date and time of the final
exam.

  
**All written assignments must be typed.**

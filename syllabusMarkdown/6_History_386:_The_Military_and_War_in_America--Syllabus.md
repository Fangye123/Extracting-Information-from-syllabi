**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

  * This course is a survey of military history and the interaction between society and military institutions, technology and techniques, from 1763 to the present. The course will study the interrelationships of warfare, technology and society in American history. The course will focus on such questions as how changing "styles" of warfare, the composition of the military establishment (militias, citizen armies, paid professionals, mercenaries), and the transformations in military technology have impacted upon state and society. Conversely, it will also investigate how political and societal changes have influenced the nature of warfare in American history. 

**PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE:**

  * **1)** To acquaint students with the political, social, economic and cultural impact of the military upon modern American and world history. 
  * **2)** To sharpen the students' skills in historical interpretation, research and writing. 

**CLASS SCHEDULE AND PROCEDURE:**

  * **1)** The class schedule will consist of three fifty minute sessions each week. The first part of each session is allotted to lectures by the instructor, while the second portion occasionally will be devoted to questions and discussion. 
  * **2)** Lectures both supplement and complement reading assignments, as well as introduce problems to be brought up in the discussion periods. Discussion periods investigate problems and look into interpretations of subjects in the readings and/or lectures. 
  * **3)** Brief outlines of lectures, maps and other supplementary readings will be distributed to students on the web. 

**STUDENT REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE:**

  * **1) Attendence:** Students are expected to regularly attend lectures and participate actively in classroom discussions. Attendence will be taken regularly. Since there is no penalty for absences, there will be no excused absences. 
  * **2) Reading assignments:** Readings from the text and supplementary sources are given on a daily basis. Two- to three-page reaction papers will be assigned from the readings four times during the semester. 
  * **3) Reaction papers:** Three one-to-two-page reaction papers will be assigned during the semester. These reaction papers will be based upon questions given on selected readings. Students are expected to express their reaction and answer each question in a one-to-two-page, typed,and double spaced paper. The two lowest of five reaction paper scores will be dropped. Each reaction paper will be worth 50 points for a total of 150 points toward the course grade. Each reaction paper will be due by E-MAIL to **his_ncp@shsu.edu** by 12:00 PM on the day stated in the syllabus. Only those who can show that they have no possible access to a computer will be allowed to turn in a hard copies of the reaction paper. **Since the two lowest of the five reaction paper scores will be dropped, no reaction papers will be accepted after this deadline, nor makeup papers accepted**. 
  * **4) Multiple Choice Quizzes:** Six multiple choice quizzes, consisting of ten multiple-choice questions each based upon quotations taken from the web readings. The lowest of the six quiz scores will be dropped. Each quiz is worth 20 points for a total of 100 points toward the course grade. **Since the lowest of the six quizzes will be dropped, nor makeup quizzes will be given**. 
  * **5) Examinations:** Exams will be presented on the sixth, eleventh and finals week. Each examination will consist of one essay section. Each examination will count 50 points toward the course grade. In total the three examinations will count 150 points toward the course grade. 
  * **6) Geography Quizes:** Twelve brief geography quizes will be presented and are scheduled in the course outline. The two lowest of twelve geography quiz scores will be dropped. Each quiz will count for 10 points for a total of 100 points toward the course grade. **Since the two lowest of twelve geography quiz scores will be dropped there will be no make ups for geography quizes.**
  * 6) Makeups: Makeup examinations will be given on one afternoon near the end of the session. Makeup examinations will be given only to students who have legitimate excuses (e.g. medical emergency, court appearance, etc.) and can produce a written explanation from an authoritative third party (doctor, court clerk, etc.). **No makeups for multiple choice quizzes, geography quizes or reaction papers.** **No exceptions will be made. Do not ask.**
  * 7) Evaluation of student performance will be made upon: a) the multiple choice questions [20%]; the geography quizes [20%]; b) the three examinations [30%]; and c) the reaction papers [30%].

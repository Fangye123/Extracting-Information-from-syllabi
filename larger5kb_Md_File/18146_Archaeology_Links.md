NB: This page is by no means comprehensive, but is merely a sample of the
sites on the web that deal with archaeology and issues of cultural property.
If you find a particularly useful site that is not listed here, please let me
know and I will add it to this page.

[Archaeology on the World Wide Web.
](http://www.swan.ac.uk/classics/antiquity.html)This is an on-line article
written by David Gill in 1995. Of course it is outdated, but he reviews some
of the resources out there, providing links to them. This is an excellent
place to start.  
  
[Frequently Asked Questions about a Career in Archaeology in the
U.S.](http://www.museum.state.il.us/ismdepts/anthro/dlcfaq.html) This site is
much more than the title implies. Lots of information and lots of links geared
towards practical matters of archaeology. Check out the bibliography--quite
extensive.  
  
[Repatriation Bibliography
](http://sorrel.humboldt.edu/~nasp/repat.html)prepared by Brian Gill. This
deals specifically to repatriation of native American artifacts.  
**General Resources for Mediterranean Archaeology on the World Wide Web** **  
**[Classics and Mediterranean
Archaeology](http://rome.classics.lsa.umich.edu:80/) from the University of
Michigan. One of the best and most thorough. It provides links to
organizations, publications, museums, etc.  
[ArchNet](http://www.lib.uconn.edu/ArchNet/) from the University of
Connecticut at Storrs. This deals with all areas of archaeology (not just
Mediterranean)  
[Hellenic Ministry of Culture](http://www.culture.gr/welcome.html). A very
well done (and richly illustrated) survey of Greek culture. This is especially
useful for exploring regional museums.  
[ARGOS ](http://argos.evansville.edu/)This is a search engine limited to the
Ancient and Medieval world on the Internet. This can sometimes yield much more
fruitful results than some of the generic search engines.

**General Links to Resources:** **  
**[ArchNet Cultural Resource Management and Historical
Preservation](http://archnet.uconn.edu/archnet/topical/crm/) (with many links)

**[International Journal of Cultural Property
](http://www3.oup.co.uk/intjcp/scope/) Tech has just begun subscribing to this
journal, and as a result we should have on line access to the text of all of
their recent articles. Stay tuned for more information, but at least have a
look at the [table of
contents](http://www3.oup.co.uk/intjcp/hdb/Volume_07/Issue_01/) of their most
recent issue. You will probably find many articles that will be of use to you
when you are thinking and writing your papers.

[The "Looting Question"
Bibliography.](http://wings.buffalo.edu/academic/department/anthropology/Documents/lootbib.html)Web
and Literary Resources on the Archaeological Politics of Private Collecting,
Commercial Treasure Hunting, Looting, and "Professional" Archaeology. Compiled
by Hugh Jarvis - PhD Student in Anthropology and MLS Student in Information
and Library Studies, University at Buffalo. This resource is intended to be
provide a comprehensive overview of what is often a controversial topic, for
personal interest and classroom use. This list is intended to provide items
which reflect extreme perspectives as well as more neutral and consensus-
seeking views. The list is extensive, with the hope that users will be able to
find a range of these items close to hand. While the main focus is on North
America, materials from around the world are noted whenever possible (and
certainly encouraged). Items are added as they come to my attention or are
contributed by others.

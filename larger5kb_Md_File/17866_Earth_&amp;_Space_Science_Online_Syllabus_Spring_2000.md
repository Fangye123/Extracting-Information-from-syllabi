Class schedule:

**

  * Classes are delivered over the Internet using electronic mail and the World Wide Web. The course management system, WebCT, is used with a web browser. WebCT supplies many features including a calendar, bulletin board, internal class e-mail, chat, quizzes, and links to course materials.

  * You may access the course materials, e-mail, bulletin boards, and chat rooms, etc. according to your own schedule. 

  * It is strongly advised that you set up a regularly scheduled time to work on the course. 

  * You should plan on **at least 10 hours per week dedicated to course work in a 15 week semester course. If you are taking the course in a shorter period, you will need to spend more time. A 6 1/2 week summer semester course would require 23 hours per week. A 2-week RESA course would require about 75 hours of work per week.**. This must include: 
    * Reading your **internal WebCT e-mail** daily. 
    * Reading **all postings on the class online bulletin board**. ( **Daily checking** is suggested. Be sure to check all fora/forums.) 
    * Posting to the bulletin board for required postings, general questions related to course work and to participate in discussions. 
    * Reading the **WebCT Calendar** , where all assignment due dates, quiz dates, etc. will be posted. Remember to **click on the numeral (date) on the calendar to see the entire entry.** Only a short note will show on the calendar itself. Details are on a window that will open when you click on the date. 
    * Reading online course notes as assigned. 
    * Viewing the streaming video clips that are available.
    * **Reading the textbook chapters** corresponding to the assigned class notes, as assigned). 
    * Outside readings as needed to supplement course material 
    * Taking notes on all readings 
    * Working on homework assignments in the Lab Manual, as well as papers, reports, or projects as assigned, and submitting them by the deadline dates. 
    * Working with other students (online) on group projects as assigned. 
    * Participating in chat sessions at least occasionally, as offered. 

**Please be sure you have set aside adequate time!!!**

  * There will be two proctored exams (a Midterm and a Final). Further information will be provided via the Bulletin Board. 

* * *

**What is WebCT?**

**

WebCT is the delivery system for online courses in the University System of
Georgia.

WebCT is a course management software package that is accessed with a web
browser such as Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer. WebCT can be used to
create sophisticated World Wide Web-based educational environments. It can be
used with fully online courses, or to publish materials that supplement face-
to-face courses.

WebCT courses also offer student tracking, allowing the instructor to
determine at a glance how many times a student has accessed the course
materials, which course materials a student has accessed, and times of first
and last access.

WebCT offers many course tools for the student such as:

  * Calendar for assignments (student may have private calendar postings) 
  * Online course notes pages 
  * Online quizzes 
  * Bulletin Board 
  * Chat rooms 
  * Space to post web pages and presentations for the class 
  * Grade recording 
  * Space to keep student's private notes online 
  * and much more

This particular course may or may not choose to utilize any or all of these
features.

* * *

**

Accessing your course notes using WebCT course software

**

Class notes are to be accessed through the following web page:

[ http://www.gpc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/gore.htm
](http://www.gpc.peachnet.edu/~pgore/gore.htm)

Once WebCT passwords are assigned, **_you must log into WebCT, which counts as
class attendance.

_

* * *

**

Communicating with your Instructor

**

All students must provide the instructor with your private (not shared with
anyone) e-mail address, phone numbers and address. This may be done by e-mail.

Regular communication is a very important part of this course. Please feel
free to ask questions of your instructor at any time, either by e-mail, on the
bulletin board, by phone, or in person during office hours (if available).

**_

E-mail response time_ :

**

Your instructor will generally reply to your e-mail within 24 hours unless
they are out of town (which should bel announced on the WebCT Bulletin Board,
e-mail, or calendar). Your instructor may or may not check e-mail on weekends,
depending on their schedule, so do not expect a prompt reply if you post late
Friday afternoon or Friday night. Your instructor may not see your message
until Monday morning.

* * *

**Basis of Grading

**

33% Proctored Midterm Exam

33% Proctored Final Exam

33% Homework assignments, reports, projects, online quizzes, movie question
sheets, posting to class bulletin board (you must post as assigned or as
requested on the bulletin board).

Each assignment has a specific due date that will be printed on the WebCT
calendar when the assignment is given. The assignment will be due on the date
specified. There may be some flexibility, but late assignments will lose
points. No assignments will be accepted after they are two weeks late or after
the instructor has returned corrected and graded assignments to students,
which ever comes first.

Assignments will be returned to students by mail several times during the
semester, or you may pick them up from the office. Grades will be available
through WebCT.

_Note on online quizzes_ : All online quizzes are closed book, closed note
quizzes. Students are not to give or receive help on the quizzes. If a
student's quiz grades are substantially higher than their proctored Midterm
and/or Final Exam grades, the student may be required by the instructor to
retake the quizzes in a proctored setting, before the final course grade will
be assigned.



**

THE FINAL EXAM IS CUMULATIVE AND COMPREHENSIVE

**

A note about the final: Students who get less than 70% on the final exam will
not receive an A for a final course grade, and similarly, students who get
less than 60% on the final exam will not receive a B for a final grade,
regardless of their overall average plus any extra credit.

The lecture grade is separate from the lab grade, if the student is enrolled
in a lab.

Grading scale:

90-100% A

80-90% B

70-80% C

60-70% D

below 60% F

**EXTRA CREDIT:**

There will be opportunities for extra credit projects or papers during the
semester. **Up to five earned extra credit points can be applied to your final
class average.** Submit your ideas for extra credit by e-mail to your
instructor for approval of topics. Extra credit exercises must be done
independently from other students. **All extra credit must be typed using a
computer word processor.

**

Possible extra credit projects (one point each):

    1. Watch a geology-related television show or video (other than those required for the class). Take _detailed notes_ (several pages) to turn in, along with the title and dates of the show. TYPE.
    2. Attend optional field trip. Type notes.
    3. Attend public geology lectures in the community (such as Atlanta Geological Society meetings) and take notes to turn in. Type.
    4. Visit a historical geology-related museum in the area and take notes on what you see (Fernbank Science Center, Red Mountain Museum in Birmingham, Anniston (Alabama) Museum of Natural History, etc.). TAKE DETAILED NOTES! TYPE.
    5. Research paper (3 pages AS A MINIMUM, typed, double-spaced, no more than 1" margin, with 3 outside references to magazine articles, Internet sites, or books other than your text.) YOU MUST TURN IN A XEROX OR PRINT OUT OF THE REFERENCES YOU USED.

GPC WITHDRAWAL POLICY (for students taking this course for College Credit)

**

A student who officially withdraws by the midpoint of the course will receive
a grade of "W". A student who withdraws after the midpoint of the quarter will
receive a "WF" unless approval as a hardship withdrawal is received from the
dean.

If you choose to stop logging in to WebCT, or to stop reading and responding
to e-mails from the instructor, you must complete the withdrawal process
through the Registrar's Office by the specified dates, or you will receive an
"F" for the course. It is not the instructor's responsibility to withdraw
students, but the instructor reserves the right to withdraw a student for non-
attendance (not logging into WebCT, not responding to e-mails, or not turning
in assignments).

* * *

**

POLICY ON ACADEMIC DISHONESTY

**

Academic dishonesty (cheating and plagiarism) will not be tolerated. Georgia
Perimeter College students should read the sections on cheating and plagiarism
in the _Georgia Perimeter College Student Handbook_ and _Georgia Perimeter
College Catalog.

_

Cheating includes (among other things), use of unauthorized papers during a
test (no matter what the content), copying from another student's paper during
a test, allowing another student to copy from your paper during a test,
unauthorized access to old exams or to an exam given to the class if you are
taking it late for some reason, copying another student's homework
assignments, using or turning in a photocopy of another student's assigned
work, paying someone to write a paper or do an assignment for you, buying or
downloading a term paper, or leaving the room during or before turning in your
paper.

With online testing, it is particularly important to pay strict attention to
academic honesty. Do not access a test online before you are ready to take it
(soon the computer will recognize you and only allow you to access it once).
Do not look at a printout of the test before you take it. Do not look at your
books or notes or other papers while taking an online test. Do not have
another person take the test for you. Do not have another person tell you
answers to the test.

Plagiarism includes copying any phrases, sentence, or sentences verbatim from
the reference source without using quotation marks and without providing a
_complete_ reference (author, date, source of material, volume, pages, etc.),
or printing out an article directly from a computer database (such as
_Encarta_ or off the World Wide Web) and turning it in as your own work.
Students must read, synthesize, and write their own original sentences; learn
to _paraphrase_. Even when paraphrasing, a complete reference must be provided
to the paraphrased sentences. _NEVER steal words directly from any source and
present them as your own_.

Students are responsible for doing their own work, even if they "work
together". If two papers are turned in that show great similarity such that
the instructor interprets it as evidence of cheating or plagiarism, both will
be penalized.

A report will be filed with the Campus Dean of Student Affairs for any alleged
cheating or plagiarism incident. (See procedure in _Georgia Perimeter College
Catalog_.) The case will be heard by the College Court. Penalties may include
suspension or expulsion.

The faculty member is free to assign the grade he or she thinks is appropriate
for the assignment or for the semester (regardless of any outcome from College
Court).

Any student found by the instructor to have represented someone else's work as
his/her own, will receive a _zero_ for that quiz, exam, or assignment for the
first offense. The second offense will result in the assignment of a grade of
"F" for the course. (If several papers are turned in _together_ or at the same
time, and each contains evidence of cheating or plagiarism, they will be
considered as _separate_ offenses, and will result in immediate assignment of
a grade of "F" for the course.) T his policy applies to cheating or plagiarism
on extra credit work as well.

Cheating on an exam will jeopardize your grade; if you receive a zero on an
exam it will be extremely difficult to receive a passing grade for the course.

Americans with Disabilities Act Statement

If you are a student who is disabled as defined under the Americans with
Disabilities Act and require assistance or support services, please seek
assistance through the GPC Center for Disability Services. A CDS Counselor
will coordinate those services.

Equal Opportunity Statement

No person shall, on the grounds of race, color, gender, religion, creed,
national origin, age, disability, or veteran status, be excluded from
employment or participation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity conducted by Georgia
Perimeter College.

Affirmative Action Statement

Georgia Perimeter College adheres to affirmative action policies designed to
promote diversity and equal opportunity for all its faculty and students.

You are expected to read and abide by the General Policies of Georgia
Perimeter College, as stated in the _College Student Handbook_ and in the
_College Catalog_.

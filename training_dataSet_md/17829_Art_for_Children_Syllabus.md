**\----------     LEARNING DBAE    \----------**  
Today art is generally taught from the perspective of DBAE (Discipline Based
Art Education).  
DBAE refers to learning four art disciplines: **Production, Criticism,
Aesthetics, and Art History**  
---  

**PRODUCTION SKILLS** In order to learn to teach   **production** skills in
art we need to learn how to practice and foster perception, imagination,
memory, and creativity.  Skills are developed with practice. Creative thinking
is fostered by asking open questions and by rewarding unique solutions.  No
work is copied from other artists or photographs.  All work is based on
observation, memory, and imagination. |  |  **STRUCTURE**  
**and CRITICISM** Learn to teach the **structure** of art.   This is its
elements, principles, and styles.  Art **criticism  ** means that we foster
intelligent and objective discussion about art.  It does not require a
negative stance.  |  |  **AESTHETICS  **  
**and BEAUTY** Learn to teach the nature of art, its purposes, and meanings.
Learn to d **efine art** , beauty and ugliness in order to foster aesthetic
experience. |  |  **ART  **  
**HISTORY** Learn to teach art from other cultures and times.   To do this we
learn to work from our own experiences and observations to foster better
understanding of  ourselves.  From this we learn ways to better appreciate
others and their art work.  The child's work is used to build a frame of
reference to see the work of others.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
**In addition to DBAE we learn about** about **children's development** in art
in order to teach in age-appropriate and child centered ways.  
---  
  
* * *

**\---------- LEARNING METHODS     \----------**top of page  

* * *  
  
---  
**CREATE and REFLECT  **  
We make art. We experientially learn how artists get ideas, we practice
seeing, we practice skills with materials, and we learn positive discussion
and interaction skills related to our own and other art products  |

> **LISTEN and RESPOND**  
>  Your active participation is evidenced by your questions.  Each student is
expected share without dominating discussions.

| **TEACH and REFLECT  **  
Early in the term you pass on some skills by teaching them to another person.  
In the final month you teach several art sessions  to one or more children.
**Audio taping of these sessions is required** to help your review. Video
taping is optional.  
---|---|---  
**WATCH and REFLECT  **  
We reflect on, question, and propose alternate ideas based on instruction in
videos and possibly actual class observations of children making and viewing
art.  |

> **READ and REFLECT  **  
> Assignments based on the text, WWW pages, books, journals and other sources
augment class work.

| **REVIEW and WRITE EXAMS**  
Exams include objective questions based on content studied. Other items
describe learning situations. You are asked to propose instructional ideas
consistent with educational philosophy learned in this course.  
**COLLABORATIVE LEARNING**  
Most successful teachers know how to collaborate and learn from each other.
Some of our assignments are done collaboratively. If you wonder how this work
is graded, see the explanation with this link.

* * *

**Weekly Schedule     **top of page **Some of this course is taught outside
the classrooms**. Substantial material for this course is presented through
technology, with our classroom and our labs serving as a place and time to
touch base.

Details of the schedule are not complete at the time of this update.  E-mail
the instructor if you need updated details. [marvinpb@goshen.edu](mailto:
marvinpb@goshen.edu)

In addition to class time, students are expected to spend an average of 4 to 6
hours each week on preparation for this class.  This time is used for:

  * reading e-mail from the instructor or from other art teachers
  * reading [assignments](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/309assig.html) 
  * locating and [studying material](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/webquest.html) on the Internet such as WebQuests.
  * attending [Topics and Issues](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/topics&i.html) sessions
  * listening to or watching tapes - some on reserve in library
  * writing [assignments](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/309assig.html)
  * working on [art compositions](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/Montage.html)
  * assessing art works
  * visiting and responding to art in galleries and museums
  * class preparation 
  * completing assignments
  * [field teaching](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/fieldtch.html)
  * study time for tests

top of page

* * *

**E-mail Required** Students should check E-mail before every class in a
timely fashion to allow yourself time to prepare for class.   You may receive
information that is tested on quizzes and tests, assignment updates, and other
very important information by e-mail.  In most cases this information will be
posted at least 24 hours prior to your class session, giving you time for any
last minute class preparations. If you have an e-mail account at home that is
other than your college account, be sure to configure your college e-mail
account to automatically forward all your messages to your active account at
home. The Shertz Computer Center staff can help you do this.  If this is does
not work for you, please send the instructor your home e-mail address
immediately so it can be added to the class list e-mail addresses.
[marvinpb@goshen.edu](mailto: marvinpb@goshen.edu)

* * *

**Contacts with the Instructor** Phone 533-0171 until 10 p.m.   E-mail at any
hour: [marvinpb@goshen.edu](mailto: marvinpb@goshen.edu)   The office is in
the Visual Arts building in Room VA13.  The instructor's
[schedule](http://www.goshen.edu/~marvinpb/Scheds99.html) is posted on the
web.Phone or E-mail with your questions, comments, or for an appointment with
the instructor.  Your questions, ideas, and input about the course are welcome
and needed.

**Art Education Journal/Sketchbook    **top of page Each student keeps a
personal Art Education Journal/Sketchbook. Binders and some paper will be
provided in class.  The Journal/Sketchbook contains:

  * Dated sketches and other projects done in class as drawing ritual
  * Your thoughts about teaching/learning art - questions - lessons - theories \- reflections
  * Artwork and your journal from the Pass It On assignment
  * Responses to Art Department [Topics and Issues](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/topics&i.html)
  * Samples from Artsednet Talk - the e-mail discussion group of art teachers
  * The cover is designed by you as a Self-Portriat Photomontage
  * Other materials and assignments that we will add 

* * *

> **Text**  
>  The text in this class is  _ **Creating Meaning Through Art** _ by Judith
Simpson and others, 1998

* * *

**How To Earn A Good Grade   **top of page **Attend Regularly**

> Teaching is a profession. **A ttendance** and punctuality habits rank very
high for teacher employability. Any student with a poor attendance record or a
record of arriving late to class will be passed over by most employers. Attend
regularly (no automatic class cuts).  Use the phone at 533-0171 or
[e-mail](mailto: marvinpb@goshen.edu) to contact the instructor if you have a
field trip, experience illness, or other serious problems preventing your
attendance. You are responsible for what you missed (excused or not).  You
grade is effected if the missed work is not completed or if the absence is not
justified.  You grade is effected more if both incomplete work and unjustified
absences occur.

**Participate Actively**

> Listen actively and **participate in class** by voicing your share of
ideas and questions.

**Use Technology**

> Use and **become comfortable with computers and technology**. Not all
learning takes place in our classroom. Today we teach and learn in a virtual
classroom. You are expected to **check your e-mail before each class session.
**Generally, new material may be posted to you at least 24 hours prior to
classes, so you can make last minute class preparation. You can expect
information about timely topics related to our class, e-mail and Internet
assignments, test items, additions and elaboration on reading and lectures,
and so on. In today's schools, electronic communication is one of the ways
that teaching and learning takes place. It should not replace face-to-face
meetings, but it can add an additional way to communicate.

>

> top of page

**Do the Assignments Well**

> Nurture your inner teacher and the collaborative learner within you. Be
helpful, considerate and **encourage others** in class.   Turn in **written
work** that is thoughtful, that is on time, is well organized, is proofread,
is corrected, and is professional in appearance (no torn edges from spiral
notebooks or computer form edges).   Handwritten papers are **not** accepted
except when assigned to be written during class.   Late work gets a lower
grade. Most of the assignments prepare you for field teaching. Some
assignments are done in groups and you are also evaluated by your peers.  
> [For a list of anticipated assignments click
here](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/309assig.html).

>

> In the **F ield Teaching** Assignment near the end of the term we practice
some of the new ideas from the course.  Plan and teach your field teaching
sessions the best you can. A partner or planning group is useful.

>

> For a good grade in **[F ield
Teaching](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/fieldtch.html)**:  
> a. Making contacts with parents and children promptly and be prompt and
reliable.  Be professional.  
> b. Plan lessons that include all the parts of a good lesson (see [Planning
to Teach Art](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/artlsn.html))  
> c. Teach the parts of your lessons or unit in the right sequence (see
[Planning to Teach Art](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/artlsn.html))  
> d. Practicing ahead of time with all materials and visual aides used.
Otherwise, things get overlooked.  
> e. You must test the tape recorder ahead of time in the setting you plan to
work. Be sure it picks up, records, and plays back properly in the setting you
are planning to use it. Technical problems are not an excuse unless you can
show that you thoroughly tested all aspects of the equipment before using it.
Have extra cassettes and batteries (if needed) on hand.

>

> **L earn by Producing Art  **top of page  
> Develop **skills and allow yourself to be creative** in your art. In this
category, serious effort, growth, improved skills, willingness to try things,
are expected and graded.   The art itself is **not** compared to others in
determining grades, but you are expected to improve with practice. *See
Grading Philosophy below.  Even though you are not compared to others, this
aspect of the course can be graded by assessing your involvement in your
artwork, your willingness to try new things and experiment, the seriousness of
your efforts, your ability to become totally involved in the creative process,
and so on.  In some cases students earn credit for individual growth and
development as an artist. We do use the critique process in relation to our
own artwork, but the critique process is used to learn how to discuss and
respond to artwork, not to grade it. If you take a college studio art class,
your artwork will be graded because the goal of that course is related to
becoming a professional artist. This is a teaching/learning theory class. Art
work is practiced as a way to think about the art teaching/learning process.

>

> **L earn About Art**  
> You are expected to gain knowledge about art, and this can be graded.
Knowledge about art includes things like visual elements, principles of design
and composition, art styles, names of some artists, some art history,
generally accepted cultural purposes of art, and generally accepted
definitions of art.

>

> **Learn Art Education**  
>  Art Education is the art and science of teaching and learning art. Today,
DBEA (Discipline Based Art Education) includes four disciplines. They are art
production, art history, art criticism, and aesthetics. This of course is only
one way to view what is done. For another perspective on what is learned in
art education, see the state standards at the end of this document.

>

> **Tests** are graded in the usual manner.   There are at least two tests and
comprehensive final. Small tests may happen unannounced, or they may be only
announced through e-mail. Those with the best scores get an A.  Those with
lower scores will get a fair distribution of grades, but since the tests are
not standardized it is impossible to determine a percentage point used to
determine each grade. Tests will have both a factual component and a
thoughtful component.  Most students do well to **form a study group** to quiz
each other over factual material.   Additionally, such a group is a good way
to **discuss options for the thoughtful situation questions**.   Good teachers
solve many classroom problems through discussions with their peers.  I have
put down some [things that have worked for me to get **better test
grades**](http://www.goshen.edu/~marvinpb/grades.html) when I was a student.  
> [Click here to see the page.](http://www.goshen.edu/~marvinpb/grades.html)

>

> G **rading Philosophy   **top of page  
> Artwork gets an A  
> Those who are attentive, show an interest, are open to their own creative
ideas, and conscientiously work hard to learn art will get an **A** in their
artwork in this class. Those who miss work sessions and those who display an
"I don't care" attitude about their art may get a lower grade on their
artwork.  
>

> Your artwork is not compared to others in this class, but it is expected
that all work be completed and that you are fully involved in the process.
Mistakes are expected. Mistakes are fascinating. These are learning moments.
In this course we do want to learn about art, so we do learn to evaluate
artwork, but this is not for the purpose of _grading_ it in this class.

>

> Even though it is not graded in this course, artwork is often graded. [Click
here](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/rubric2.html) to see an example of a rubric
used by art teachers when evaluating artwork and/or when the grading of
artwork is required by the school. [Click
here](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/critiqueform.html) to see an artwork
critique form that an art teacher could use to help students discuss and learn
the merits of an artwork.

>

> Grading other assignments and tests in this course  
> You are preparing to be a professional teacher in this class. Therefore, in
your profession (teaching), you are graded more conventionally on the parts of
this course other than artwork. You are not necessarily compared to others in
class, but you are expected to learn the material and to attain professional
standards as teachers of art to children. Grading cannot be avoided in college
assignments in our profession. College grades remain one way to decide who is
qualified to teach children.

>

> **G rading Collaborative Learning**  
> Successful teachers know how to collaborate and benefit from each other.
Together we get better teaching ideas. Together we get better solutions to
problems. We can enjoy helping each other and we gain the advantage of each
other's support. A goal of this course is to help us learn to become teachers
who help and benefit from colleagues.  A goal is help us learn that few
problems are solved by complaining and blaming, but teaching gets better by
creative experimentation and by sharing our best practices.

>

> Children in schools are often better teachers than their teachers. However,
we must be careful in how we form learning groups. Judith Harris, in _The
Nurture Assumption, 1999_ , says, "When teachers divide up children into good
readers and not-so-good ones, the good readers tend to get better and the not-
so-good ones to get worse." p.242.  In a diverse group, every person in the
group is expected to play a useful and unique contributing role.

>

> Some of our assignments are done collaboratively. Students like the extra
learning from group assignments and they enjoy the process of learning
together. Those who complain about group assignments do so because they feel
some students fail to pull their own weight in the group. When this happens, a
mature approach is to see the group as a field teaching opportunity. Not all
of us have the same ability to make traditional contributions to a group. We
can all help the group by asking open questions. When we find ourselves to be
experts, it may be too easy to give answers and solutions without using
questions that help others in the group understand the concepts. Some of us
may be less experienced and less knowledgeable, but we can be willing workers
and willing learners. We can affirm the more experienced in the group to feel
good about sharing what they know. We can be appreciative and responsive. We
too can ask open questions.

Note:
top of page  
None of us likes to be critical of our friends. However, learning to make
assessments is part of learning to teach.

Teachers often complain about the need to give grades. Sometimes subjects like
art are evaluated by other methods than by standard grades. The above form is
used to grade group work on class assignments.  It would never be used to
grade the artwork.  This [link](http://www.goshen.edu/art/ed/rubric2.html)
shows a rubric for artwork.

| **Course Description**  
Welcome to History 201! This course is a survey of American history from the
period of exploration and colonization by Europeans to the end of the Civil
War. Some of the topics to be covered by the course are: the peopling of North
America, the process of colonization, patterns of colonial life, the road to
revolution, the creation of a new nation, industrialization, shifting ideas of
citizenship and nationhood, territorial expansion, the persistence of the
slave economy, sectional conflict, and the Civil War.  
  
**Course Objectives**  
This course has been designed to improve your ability to:  
\- describe and explain the significance of the major ideas, events, and
communities that shaped American history prior to 1865;  
\- compare and contrast the economic, political, social, and cultural goals
and experiences of those of different class, gender, racial, and religious
backgrounds at different points in time;  
\- analyze and interpret primary source materials from the period under study;  
\- use primary and secondary sources to articulate your understanding of the
past, both verbally and in written assignments; and  
\- use maps as a tool in historical study.

| **Course Requirements**  
_Assignments:_ Graded assignments and their percentage of the final grade are
as follows:  
\- 10% (40 points) for class participation (attendance, discussions)  
\- 5% (20 points) for one mini-presentation  
\- 30% (120 points) for three essays  
\- 20% (80 points) for mid-semester examination  
\- 25% (100 points) for final examination  
\- 10% (40 points) for quizzes  
\- plus, up to 40 points extra credit for an optional book review  
Uncompleted assignments will be scored as a "zero" and averaged with the
completed assignments to produce a final grade.  
  
_Discussion:_ This course will be discussion-oriented. Lectures will be short
and relatively few in number. Thus, reading and active class participation
will be essential to your success in this course. Most of our class time will
be spent discussing the assigned readings. This means that you should not only
attend class regularly and complete all readings in a timely manner, but also
come to class prepared to share your understanding of the readings, pose
questions about the readings, challenge the instructor and other students, and
relate the readings to other aspects of the course. Use the [Guide to Critical
Reading](http://homepages.luc.edu/~snewma1/courses/201read.htm) to help
prepare for class discussions and think more critically about the readings for
the course.  
  
_Mini-Presentations:_ On select days when we discuss primary source documents,
I will ask two or three students to present one of the assigned documents to
the class. Dates for the presentations will be arranged during the first week
of classes and the
[schedule](http://homepages.luc.edu/~snewma1/courses/201pres.htm) posted on
the course website. Once you have the date of your presentation, you may
decide which document to present from the list of assigned readings for that
day. I would recommend against presenting the same document as one of your co-
presenters. Individual presentations should be no more than five minutes in
duration. You should briefly describe the document and explain how it (or some
aspect of it) relates to the main theme of that day's documents and/or the
associated chapter in the textbook.
[Guidelines](http://homepages.luc.edu/~snewma1/courses/201pres1.htm) are
posted on the website. Those not introducing documents are still responsible
for reading them and contributing to the class discussion that follows the
initial presentations.  
  
_Essays:_ You will be expected to complete three brief essays (3-5 pages each)
in this course. These papers should be typed, double-spaced, and follow the
format and citation styles explained in Kate Turabian's _A Manual for Writers
of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_ , 5th Edition (Chicago: University
of Chicago Press, 1987). Copies are available at the reference desk at the
Cudahy Library. More detailed instructions for the essays will be provided
about two weeks before the due date.  
  
_Examinations:_ There will be two exams in this course. They will likely
include a variety of essay, short answer, identification, and multiple-choice
questions. Some parts of the final exam will require you to synthesize
material from both before and after the mid-semester exam. Guidance to help
you prepare for both exams will be provided. Except in cases of emergency,
requests for make-up exams should be made no less than one week before the day
of the exam. Make-ups will be granted only in instances of illness or
scheduling conflicts deemed unavoidable by the instructor.  
  
_Quizzes:_ There will be several in-class quizzes during the semester. Most
will cover material from the textbook, such as maps and key terms. The date
and focus of the quizzes will be announced ahead of time.  
  
_Extra Credit Option:_ Students seeking an additional challenge may opt to
complete a critical book review for extra credit. You may review any book on
any topic related to this course, so long as it is listed in one of the end-
of-chapter bibliographies in the Faragher textbook. The completed book review
would need to be 7-10 pages in length and follow guidelines that I will
provide you upon request. Book reviews are due no later than Tuesday, April
30, at 5pm. Students who are interested in completing this project should
consult me no later than April 4 to make your interest known and to obtain a
copy of the [book review
guidelines](http://homepages.luc.edu/~snewma1/courses/201esy4.htm). History
majors should note that at least one book review must be included in your
graduation portfolio.  
  
|  
|  **Classroom Courtesy**  
Don't do homework for other classes. Don't read newspapers or magazines. Turn
off beepers and cell phones. Listen to your fellow classmates' ideas and
opinions respectfully.  
  
**Academic Dishonesty**  
All work submitted for this course must be the product of your own
intellectual efforts. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism (i.e., the
presentation of another's work, dead or alive, published or unpublished, as
your own or without proper citation), is not allowed and will be penalized.
This rule also applies to content copied from web sites. Internet plagiarism
is easy to detect! A grade of zero will be assigned to any paper or exam in
which an instance of academic dishonesty is detected. The zero will then be
averaged with the other grades to determine the final grade for the course.  
  
**Students with Disabilities**  
Students who are disabled or impaired should meet with the professor within
the first two weeks of the semester to discuss the need for any special
arrangements.  |

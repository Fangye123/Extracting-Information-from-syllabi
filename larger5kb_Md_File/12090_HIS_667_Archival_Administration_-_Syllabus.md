Instructor Comments This course will serve as an introduction to the issues
and practices in the archival profession. The course will be include lectures
and in-class discussion of readings. Projects and written assignments are
designed to further acquaint students with current professional issues and
practices. Students are encouraged to visit archival institutions and
manuscript repositories in addition to those that may be visited during the
semester and talk with staff . There will be guest speakers who are practicing
archivists. Due to course schedule, and the instructor's schedule, field trips
will need to be on Monday or Friday. We will try to arrange one or two trips
to visit appropriate institutions during the semester. This will be discussed
in class early in the semester.

Attendance Policy Regular class attendance is expected of all students. For
every two unexcused absences the final grade will be reduced by one letter
grade, (i.e. from A to B.) Absences will be excused for the following reasons:
participation in a university-sanctioned activity or program, death in the
family or other family emergency, serious illness with a doctor's note, jury
duty, military obligation, or weather emergency making travel dangerous.
Students are also expected to attend the entire class. Arriving late or
leaving early will count as an unexcused absence, except in highly unusual
circumstances. Students are responsible for all material presented in classes
they miss or changes in the course schedule that are announced in class
whether their absence is excused or unexcused. If you miss class get notes
from someone and see me as soona s possible if you have any questions.
Students who require special arrangements for exams or in-class presentations
must make such arrangements themselves at least one week prior to the exam or
presentation. Students with a valid excuse for missing an exam or an in-class
presentation are responsible for informing the instructor as soon as possible,
but no later than the day following the exam or presentation.

* * *

Academic Honesty

It is assumed and expected that all students will present only their own work
on exams and the written assignment. Any student caught cheating will fail the
course and all such incidents will be referred to appropriate University
officials for further action, including expulsion from the University.
Plagiarism, i.e. copying material verbatim (i.e. word-for-word) without
attribution, on the writing assignment is included in the definition of
cheating. Students should consult the College of Humanistic Studies Policy on
Academic Honesty.

The policies of the College of Humanistic Studies on [Academic
Integrity](http://www.murraystate.edu/integrity/acadint.htm) and
[Plagiarism](http://www.murraystate.edu/integrity/plag.htm) and the College's
[Principles of Academic
Conduct](http://murraystate.edu/integrity/acadcond.htm) will be followed.

E-Mail Procedures

Technology Services, Second Floor, Lowery Center. It is not required that
students have a university e-mail account if they already have another
account. E-mail addresses must be turned into the instructor by Sept. 10.

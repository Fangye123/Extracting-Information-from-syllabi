**SOC 425 - ETHNICITY IN AMERICA**  
(Cross-listed as ANTH 425 and AFAM 425)

_UNIVERSITY OF NOTRE DAME_  
NOTRE DAME, INDIANA

**Fall Term, 1998**

Leonard F. Chrobot, Ph.D.

**I. DESCRIPTION**

A study of the dynamic and continual process of formation and development of
the United States as a nation by its cultural, religious, ethnic and racial
diversity; a review of the history and theory of inter-ethnic relations and
their manifestation in the basic institutions of family, education, religion,
economics, and government. Three hours. Three credits.

**II. RATIONALE**

Nowhere in the world have so many people of such diverse backgrounds come
together to form a nation. Throughout its history America has been in a
process of defining itself -- from an English colony through the melting pot
ideology to liberal pluralism. Various methods of dealing with inter-group
contact have been tried -- from expulsion, annihilation, segregation,
assimilation, amalgamation to pluralism. To understand these processes is to
understand the nature of America.

The purpose of this course is to develop toleration and understanding through
the development of verstehen, or what Charles Horton Cooley referred to as
**sympathetic introspection:** a sociologist. would come to know his subject
by  
  
---  
  | ... putting himself into intimate contact with various sorts of persons
and allowing them to awake in himself a life similar to his own, which he
afterwards, to the best of his ability, recalls and describes. In this way he
is more or less able to understand, always by introspection -- children,
idiots, criminals, rich and poor, conservative and radical, any phase of human
nature not wholly alien to his own.  
  
Sociology as a science requires rigorous and precise definitions as well as
empirical evidence. Sociology as an art seeks and incorporates into a system
of knowledge this kind of understanding.

**III. METHOD OF THE COURSE**

The course will consist of a balance of lecture, discussion, and reading. The
function of the professor is to organize the background of the problem,
introduce authors who have researched the phenomenon, stimulate self-
examination, and develop sensitivity to people who are different because of
their ethnic or racial backgrounds.

**IV. GRADING**

Students will be graded on the basis of their reading the required and
suggested assignments, periodic examinations, class discussions, a class
journal, and a mid-term and final examination. Two papers will be required:
one from 7-10 pages dealing with a specific ethnic or racial group that is
different than one's own, and a second paper or project dealing with one's own
background (or a background of choice) of 10-15 pages.

The ratio:  
  
  | 25% - Quizzes **** and cumulative mid-term  
25% - Papers (2 grades)  
25% - Journal (2 grades)  
25% - Final Examination  
  
**V. REQUIRED READINGS**

In addition to assigned articles in various books and periodicals, substantial
portions of the following books will be required:  
  
  | Kromkowski, John (Ed.) _Race and Ethnic Relations 98/99_. Guilford, CT:
Dushkin Publishing Group, 1998 (available in the Bookstore).  
McGoldrick, Monica, et al. _Ethnicity and Family Therapy_. New York: Guilford
Press, 1st Edition, 1982; Second, 1996.  
Thernstrom, Stephan (Ed.) _Harvard Encyclopedia of American Ethnic Groups_.
Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1980, especially specific thematic
essays.  
  
All of the above books will be on reserve in the Library. Xerox copies of the
thematic essays from the Harvard Encyclopedia and other material are available
in the course packet.

**VI. OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE**

In SOC 425 you will:

  * explore your own prejudices; rather than deny them, learn how to examine them for insights into yourself and others; 
  * become aware that we filter reality, we do not perceive it, through our own value system and our attitudes about ourselves, other people, and things
  * know the historical context of suffering and exploitation of various minorities throughout the formation and development of the United States in order to better understand the situation of people today;
  * examine the various universal types of inter-group relations -- annihilation, expulsion, segregation, assimilation, amalgamation, and pluralism;
  * become aware of one's own ethnic heritage(s), in order to stimulate creativity with the best of one's heritage(s), while at the same time becoming aware of the negative aspects 
  * explore the basic and universal institutions of family, religion, education, work, and government, as they find expression in various heritages by becoming aware of one's own assumptions and biases;
  * explore in depth the "story" of your own heritage(s) (or one of choice) through examination of one of its core values (e.g., "work," or "family"). We cannot understand the assumptions and pre-judgements of another culture until we admit to and understand those of our own;
  * re-commit yourself to a society and nation of cultural, religious, and racial diversity and mutual respect, to better lead in a future "America" which will be demographically different from the world today.

**VII. OFFICE HOURS**

Professor Chrobot will be available in his office in the lower level of
Bronson Hall, generally from 2:15 to 3:15 P.M. on Tuesdays and Thursdays, or
by appointment. He is best reached at his office number: 287-8932, or by email
([leonard.f.chrobot.1@nd.edu](mailto:leonard.f.chrobot.1@nd.edu)). He will
also be available after each class session.

**VIII. OTHER REQUIREMENTS**

Each class will begin with a brief meditation or prayer led by the students
taking turns. It can be of any variety, but should help focus attention on the
class session and help to dispel the distractions **** of the day.

Each class will begin with a reading of the minutes of the previous class,
which should summarize the material and discussion of the class. It should
gestalt the previous session. Wit is treasured. The assignments for the
following class should also be noted. That person is also responsible for
cleaning the blackboards before and after class. We will take turns.

Two papers are required: the first, at mid-term, a research paper on an ethnic
or racial group different from one's own. The second, a more detailed research
paper on one's own background(s), or a topic of choice. The topic and
bibliography must be approved by the professor.

Students are required to keep a Journal of their experiences. An outline of
requirements and some suggested activities will be distributed. A minimum of
one entry per class is required, more is encouraged. The purpose of the
Journal is to record, hopefully, increased awareness and sensitivity to the
ethnic diversity of our society. Self-revelation is encouraged. The Journals
will be collected at mid-term and toward the end of the term. Entries may be
typed on a computer or hand-written.

Each student will also be required to read articles from and give an oral
presentation of one reading from _Race and Ethnic Relations 98/99_ anytime
that is appropriate to class discussions or at the end of the semester.

Other experiential assignments will be given periodically to assist in
applying theory to practice. Some will be assignments for Journal entries.

Quizzes will be **** given periodically, usually announced, to obtain feedback
and assist **** in understanding.

**IX. ABSENCE POLICY**

Students are expected to be present for all class sessions. Three unexcused
absences make a student liable to failure. When absent, students are
responsible for all materials and handouts given. Quizzes or experiential
exercises missed must be made-up by oral examination or private consultation.
Missed assignments of this nature will be graded zero.

**X. SYLLABUS**

This syllabus is a suggested learning guide. Changes can be made upon the
recommendation of the students or at the discretion of the professor. Changes
will be announced at least one week in advance.

**REQUIRED/SUGGESTED ACTIVITIES AND TOPICS FOR POSSIBLE JOURNAL ENTRIES**

Note: The following are some suggestions for activities to help achieve the
concept of **_verstehen_** regarding aspects of SOC 425. Our ultimate purpose
is to study people as they interact in groups. It may be easier for some
students to pair up with another student (or group of students) for
transportation and support. Some activities are required. Note if a change in
attitude changes your behavior, or a change in behavior changes your attitude.

**Required:**

1\. While walking through campus classify people by either accepting them or
rejecting them.

2\. Guess the ethnic background of people on campus.

3\. Watch a movie or read a novel that pertains to an ethnic group about which
you would like to know more.

4\. Analyze a television sitcom for its assumptions, biases, and values.

5\. Analyze a soap opera (it may take more than one or two episodes) for its
value assumptions.

6\. Apply the Stoic philosophy saying: "Seek not what you want to happen, seek
to want what happens" to a particular experience and describe it.

7\. Note instances of "labeling," i.e., the reduction of the complexity of a
human person to a category.

8\. Explore a strong stereotype you have, to discover what you are projecting
of yourself on the "other."

**Suggested:**

9\. Shop at the Martin Stores on US 23 and Western Avenue. Compare people,
prices, offerings, interactions.

10\. Attend a religious service significantly different from your own. Note
your feelings.

11\. Compare clerks that are urban culture types (machine-like) and folk
culture (personal interaction).

12\. Tape a conversation about your family with your grandparents. Get the
"stories" of the family that are often repeated.

13\. Go out for lunch or dinner at an authentic ethnic restaurant (family-
owned?), a fauxethnic one (decorated ethnically, but basically an urban
culture type, usually owned by a franchise), and a truly urban culture one
(McDonald's?).

14\. Spend a weekend in the home of a classmate who is significantly different
from you in ethnic or racial background or social class.

15\. Have lunch with a representative of a group which you despise.

16\. Play some music you despise. Describe why.

17\. Read a tabloid (e.g., Star) and note instances of prejudice and
stereotyping.

18\. Walk around one of the lakes on campus.

19\. Hug a tree. Take a photo of your favorite one.

20\. Select a religious value you feel strongly about and explore its opposite
value.

21\. In an interpersonal conflict, explore the "other side."

22\. Select a relevant statistic and explore its referent

23\. Explore a "kernel of truth" for the insight it gives into a particular
group.

24\. Note when you totally reject another person because s/he manifests one
value different from your own.

25\. When you become defensive over some issue, analyze what it is you are
defending and why.

26\. Analyze how people deal with pain and/or suffering differently -- blame
others, deny it magnify it, share it.

27\. Walk in the rain without an umbrella; experience it as a blessing.

28\. Explore ethnic cuisine. What food do poor people eat in a particular
culture.

29\. Note instances of the application of the following:  
a. Chrobot's Law of Some  
b. Seek to understand, don't judge.  
c. Not "either/or" but "both/and."

30\. Note instances of selective perception which reinforce your stereotypes
and watch for examples which contradict them.

31\. Ask people about their stereotype of a "Domer." What does it tell you
about the other person? What is the "kernel of truth"?

Journal entries should demonstrate your ability to: pay attention to detail,
analyze, apply insights gained in class to particular situations, hopefully
displaying increased sensitivity and awareness. Note changes or resistance to
changes in "images of reality."

**Course Title:** The History of World War II in Europe

**Course Description:** World War II was the greatest cataclysm in history.
Tens of millions of people died in battle. Millions were murdered simply
because of ethnic or religious reasons. Millions of innocent civilians were
caught up in a conflict of which they knew little and understood less. World
War II changed the face of modern Europe and the World. It is the purpose of
this course to examine the history of World War II to determine the
significance and meaning of the conflict for this generation of Americans.

**Grading System:** This course has three grading options.

**Option A:** Students selecting this option are required to complete a short
research project using World Wide Web (WEB) resources. This assignment will
involve browsing and evaluating WEB sites that contain information on one or
more aspects of the History of World War II. Your final paper should contain
text, links and citations illustrating the sources you have used in your
project. Students taking this option should plan to consult at least 10
websites that contain information found to be useful and informative. A select
number of student papers will be posted to the class web site.

Students selecting this option will meet with me to discuss research
strategies and critical thinking skills necessary to effectively retrieve,
evaluate, synthesize and document information for web based research topics.
If you intend to select this option please look over the list of suggested
topics carefully. Remember that this list is not all inclusive. If you have a
topic in mind that is not on this list please feel free to discuss this with
me. I will meet will all those intending to complete Option A at the end of
next week to discuss research topics.

The midterm examination is not required for students selecting this option.
Students selecting this option should be prepared to discuss their web based
research projects when we come to the section of the syllabus in which it is
due. This is your responsibility to the class and I will reduce your final

research project, so come to class prepared. All written material is due by

**Option B:** Students selecting this option are required to complete one book
review and take the final examination. The midterm examination is not required
for students selecting this option. Students selecting this option should be

will reduce your final grade if you are not prepared. I also ask questions
about each book, so come to class prepared.

Students taking this option must let me know by September 14, 1999. Please
note that books on World War II, or specific aspects of it, are almost legion.
They range from official histories, to memoirs by important participants, to
specific histories of certain aspects of the struggle. Be careful with your
selection to determine that the book is available and appropriate for the
course. Book reviews may be handed in at any time during the semester. All
written material is due by November 23, 1999. The final exam is December 14,
1999.

[**Instructions for Book
Review**](http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/butowsky/hist389/3index.html)

**Option C:** Students selecting this option have to take both the midterm and
final examination. Please note that under Option C no make up examinations
will be given for anyone missing the midterm. If you select option C then be
sure you do not miss the midterm.

**Additional Information** : Lectures at the beginning of each class will
provide background information and put the reading in context. After the
lecture, students who have book or web based reports due will make their
presentations. General discussion will follow for the remainder of the time.
Slides and other visual materials will be shown during class. Please note that
I will ask questions so be sure to complete all required reading before coming
to class. I ask questions in class and the lectures will be more meaningful to
you when you come to class prepared.

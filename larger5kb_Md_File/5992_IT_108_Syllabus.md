**Course Description:**  
IT 108 Programming Fundamentals (3:2:1). Prerequisite: IT 103. Introduction to
programming fundamentals. The software development process is presented.
Students learn to write programs in a high level language that supports object
oriented design. Students may not receive credit for both IT 108 after
receiving a grade of C or better in CS 112 (Computer Science and some other
majors require CS 112). IT 108 does not fulfill any IT &E; major requirements
except for the BSIT program. IT minor students may take both IT 108 and CS112.

![](http://cs.gmu.edu/~amarchan/gifs/write.gif) **Grading:**

There will be 3 exams worth 15% each, a lab quiz worth 5%, 10 lab assignments
worth 30%, 3 homework asssignments worth 10%, and a final project worth 10%. A
calendar of exams and assignment due dates may be found in the IT 108 folder
on WebCT. Pop quizzes and/or in-class extra credit assignments may be given at
the instructor's discretion.

**Note:** Due to the large enrollment, makeup exams are never given for any
reason. Late work is not accepted more than 1 week late and late work will be
penalized. Final Projects will not be accepted late. Arrive promptly to exams.
Late students may not be admitted.

_Final Project:_ The final project must be in your mason account and the text
must be written in your _own_ words. [Click here to read about the final
project due in lab week
13.](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~amarchan/it108/projects.html) _Extra Credit:_ For
up to 5 extra credit points, do a 15 minute class presentation. Get the
topic/date approved in advance. For information [Click
here.](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~amarchan/it108/present.html)

**Honor Code:** All work in this class is to be the result of individual
effort. See the instructor or TA if you need help. The instructor reserves the
right to modify the grading scale and/or require a student to be examined
orally if questions about the integrity of the student's work arise. Honor
Code violations hurt everyone! Honor code violations will be prosecuted to the
fullest extent.

This class is intended to be fun, but the student is advised that any
programming class requires a good bit of time.

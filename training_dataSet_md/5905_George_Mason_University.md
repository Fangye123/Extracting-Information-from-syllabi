**DESCRIPTION**

**The course will present data communications fundamentals and computer
networking methods, using the ISO 7-layer reference model to organize the
study. Attention will be focused on the protocols of the physical, data link
control, network, and transport layers, for local and wide area networks.
Emphasis will be given to the Internet Protocol Suite. Students will program
simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project.**

**Prerequisites: CS571 and STAT344 or equivalent; ability to program in C/C++.
Students will be required to confrm in writing that they meet the
prerequisites.**

**Project: We will use the Network Workbench (NW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the NW environment. NW will be available via IT &E computing labs in
ST2-18, 133, and 137 and by dial-in. A version that runs under Borland C++
Builder (version 5) and Microsoft Visual C++ (version 6) also is available.
Well documented code must be submitted by email to the TA for grading (submit
the module you programmed, plus diskout.txt, as ATTACHMENTS CLEARLY LABELED
WITH FILE NAMES). Additional projects are available for extra credit. The
CS656 Project TA is Rong Wang, email rwang@cs.gmu.edu, office hours 1800 to
1900 Monday and Wednesday in room 365 S&T2. She also is available by
appointment at other times (send email at least 24 hours in advance to set up
appointment).**

**The project is documented in one of the required texts. Copies of class
slides, software and documentation for the project are included with this text
on CDROM. Additional project information will be found
athttp://netlab.gmu.edu/NW.  
  
NOTE: We will be trying a new way of submitting project assignments this
Summer, via a webpage upload. More information will be provided in the slides
for Lecture 1. ******

**Students are responsible for assigned readings and all material outlined in
lecture slides.**  


**GRADING POLICY**

**Midterm exam 30%, Project 35%, Final exam 35%.**

**Project credit breakout: DLC1, DLC2, DLC3, LAN1, WAN2, TRN1 and INT3 five
points each; extra credit LAN2, WAN3, WAN4, INT1, and INT2 two points each.**

**Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam date.**

**Assignments are due by 19:00 on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10% per
class credit.**

**All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and elaborated for Computer Science.**

**Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity of
(but not higher than) A   93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B - 80; C 70.**

**Extra credit is available by doing extra projects, however no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.**

**Course communication: we will use WebCT, accessed through webct.gmu.com, for
course communication. You should either login to WebCT daily or setup your
WebCT account to notify you by email when you have a new message. Course
materials (for example, homework solutions) will be available though WebCT.**

**Internet-based course delivery: classes will be available on computer
desktops at home or office by using dial-up through GMU Internet facilities.
System requirements are a multimedia Pentium computer with Microsoft Windows
98 or later, Ghostview 6.01, and Java runtime environment 1.2 or later, with a
56kbps modem. Instructor's voice, slides, and slide annotations are delivered
to the student's desktop; students can ask questions via text or spoken input.
Classes are recorded as delivered and can be played back through the same
setup. A password is required to access online delivery and playback of
classes. Go tohttp://netlab.gmu.edu/disted to obtain a password and test
Internet class reception. You must test your connection before attempting to
participate in a class. All classes may be taken over the network, however
students must appear in person final exam.**

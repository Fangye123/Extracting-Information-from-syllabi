Course Description and Objectives  
Foundations of the Modern Age is a historical introduction to the ideas,
institutions, and events that shaped modern Western civilization. The course
is designed both to develop essential knowledge of the origins and evolution
of the modern world and to encourage a basic understanding of historical
perspective and context. It also seeks to promote the skills essential to
historical inquiry, including the capacity to define historical questions,
analyze primary documents carefully, evaluate alternative interpretations
critically, develop original arguments, and write essays clearly and
effectively.

Required Readings  
1\. Thomas Greer and Gavin Lewis, _A Brief History of the Western World_ , 8th
edition, vol. 2  
2\. Robert Strayer, et al, _The Making of the Modern World_ (on reserve in the
Duggan Library)  
3\. Electronic Texts and Images from the Internet

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  

Exams will consist of short-answer questions and large essay questions. Each
of the three exams will cover roughly one-third of the course; the third exam
will also include a comprehensive section. Links to the study questions appear
on the syllabus under the date of the review session for the exam

2\. A research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 25%
for the second)  

Your paper may be on any topic in European or American history since 1400. The
paper is to be analytical and interpretive, not simply descriptive. It should
present a thesis and develop an argument. It is incumbent upon you to define
and develop a thesis. The first draft should be approximately four to six
pages in length, and the second draft six to eight.

Secondary sources should consist mostly of scholarly articles and books, not
simply reference material and textbooks. First drafts may be limited to
sources available in the Duggan Library, but you are expected to use
Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional sources for the final draft. You should
include with your first draft a bibliography based on a comprehensive search
for sources.

The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of the thesis and
argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the quality of the
writing. The grade of the first draft will also reflect the quality of your
bibliography (based on a comprehensive search), and the second draft will
reflect the quality of the sources used. You should consult with me about your
paper at least a week before each draft is due.

Consider for a paper topic a single primary text (or a few texts) from the
course readings. Although points of emphasis will vary, your paper could
include an analysis of the text itself, the author's objectives and
assumptions, the audience, and the historical context. You would work with the
complete text, not simply the excerpts assigned in class. Your thesis could
focus on a section of the text, but your interpretation of that section would
be informed by a reading of the entire text. Internet links to complete texts
appear at the beginning of each reading assigment. Whenever possible, however,
you should consult recent editions of the text, most of which will be in
copyright and only available in print. If you choose to focus on a single
primary text, you would also need to use secondary sources that have bearing
on the text, author, audience, and historical context. Please see the [Guide
for Historical Writing](handouts/guide.html).

3\. Class participation (10%)  

The success of this class depends upon the quality of the dialogue in class.
It is expected that you will attend every class and that you will be fully
prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day. Class participation
grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency of your
contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

                                                   **Syllabus**

    History 1013 deals with the history of the world from prehistoric man until about 1600, covering ancient, classical, and medieval civilizations.  We will be dealing primarily with the ancient Near East and Europe.  The course consists primarily of lecture and discussion, with readings in an assigned textbook.

**Handouts**   All handouts for this class, including syllabus, map list, and
reading assignments, are posted to my web page.  You are responsible for
downloading and printing your own copies of all handouts.  Copies will not be
distributed in class.  The web address is

               **www.clt.astate.edu/randersn**

Go to "Course Offerings", select "World Civ to 1660".

**Readings**   The textbook is Duiker, _World History_ , vol. 1.  Not all
chapters are assigned, but it is your responsibility to get the readings done
on schedule.  Falling behind on the reading is the most common mistake made in
summer school courses; if you get behind, there simply not enough time to get
caught up again.

**Exams**   There will be three 100 point exams, including the final (which is
NOT comprehensive).  The final will be held on the last day of classes.  All
exams must be written legibly in blue or black ink; a 5 point deduction will
be made for using pencil.  Each exam will consist of a series of 10 point
"long answer" questions from lecture and readings, and a map or two. **_It is
extremely important that you take all three exams at the appointed times._**
I do not give makeups in summer school because time is so limited.  Only under
the most dire, catastrophic circumstances will I even _consider_ allowing a
makeup (example: your sentencing to life imprisonment without parole), and
then only with a _substantial_ penalty!

**Maps**   A basic knowledge of geography is necessary to understnading the
historical context.  Therefore, there will be map work.  Blank maps will be
posted to this page, along with a list of places to locate.  The same maps
will be on the exams, with ten places to put on them.  Almost everything on
the maps will be found in the book (be sure to look at the List of Maps in the
front), but there are also maps in the room, atlases in the library, and the
Internet is an excellent source for map work.

  1. **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

  
          Teaching Elementary School Mathematics (5200:480) utilizes modern strategies of psychology and methodology in elementary school mathematics on exploratory, structural, and mastery levels of learning. Upon completion of this course, the prospective teacher should be able to make decisions about the mathematical learning experience of individual students and implement these decisions. 

STUDENTS WHOSE NAMES DO NOT APPEAR ON THE CLASS LIST WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO
PARTICIPATE (TAKE EXAMS OR RECEIVE CREDIT) WITHOUT FIRST SHOWING PROOF OF
REGISTRATION (SCHEDULE OF CLASSES AND STATEMENT OF ACCOUNT) BY NO LATER THAN
FEB. 2, 1999.

  2. **RATIONALE**

  
          The primary purpose of this course is to produce well-trained practitioners who are skilled in the philosophy and methods of teaching mathematics to elementary school students. Critical thinking skills, respect for learning, creative expression, and recognition of individual differences will permeate each lesson. Strategies to encourage excellence in mathematics by all students regardless of their abilities, special needs, learning styles, or cultural background will be modeled. A variety of teaching methods will be employed: large and small group instruction, problem posing and problem solving, use of technology and calculators, and cooperative learning. By its goals and practice, 5200:480 will contribute to the overall goal of the [College of Education](http://www.uakron.edu/education/): to develop graduates who possess theoretical and technical competence, confident decision-making skills, effective communication techniques, an appreciation of diversity, a commitment to lifelong learning, and a sensitivity to standards of ethical conduct.  The practicum at Crouse Elementary School gives the preservice teacher valuable experience in the teaching of mathematics to elementary school children and exposure to a "Caring Community" philosophy. 
  3. **COURSE OBJECTIVES**

  
          The goal of this course can best be achieved if the prospective teacher can: 

>     1. Recall basic mathematical concepts in number systems, geometry,
measurement, and algebraic structures.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- Q)

>     2. Identify specific and alternative objectives for mathematics
instruction that are necessary for curriculum change and school improvement.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- C, D, G, P)

>     3. Identify alternative resources and strategies for integrating
mathematics across the disciplines, reaching specific objectives, and
modifying instruction appropriately.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- C, D, G, N, P)

>     4. Apply learning theory and research to mathematics instruction through
field-experience in an elementary school.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- C, D, G, J, L, P)

>     5. Plan for mathematical instruction for meeting special needs of
students and deliver this instruction to children using manipulatives,
technology, and other resources.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- C, D, G, H, K, L, M,
P)

>     6. Select methods of assessment appropriate for mathematics evaluation.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- J)

>     7. Learn strategies for helping parents become aware of their children's
mathematics. ([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- I)

>     8. Value mathematics as problem-solving, communications, reasoning, and
connections; foster life-long learning of mathematics.
([BTC](http://www.uakron.edu/education/btc/BTC.html) \- E, F)

**  
The Eastman Computer Music Center (ECMC), established in 1981 as an outgrowth
of the electronic music program at the School, provides computing and digital
audio facilities for the realization of compositional, performance,
theoretical and other types of musical projects by Eastman, University of
Rochester and visiting faculty, students, musicians and researchers.
Currently, the Center supports creative and instructional work by about thirty
users annually. Roughly one third of these users are composers, and another
third are either performers or music theorists. Our remaining ten or so users
are divided fairly evenly among jazz studies, music education, science and
liberal arts majors.  
**

**The two central functions of the Center are:**

>   * ****our artistic mission**** **\- to provide resources for creative and
research projects of the highest possible musical and technical quality.**

>   * ****our educational mission**** **\- to teach and to help disseminate
the use of these resources to student, professional and amateur musicians of
varying specialties, interests and prior experience, and to audiences of
similar diversity, in a manner that encourages each participant to explore and
to stretch his or her own musical capabilities and artistic vision.**

**Given the wealth of solo, chamber and large ensemble performing talent at
Eastman, many of our projects involve collaborations, from the brainstorming
stage through eventual concert presentations and/or recordings, between
composers and performers or performing ensembles. Lists of available compact
disc recordings and of publications of works realized at the Center are
included within the home web pages of several of our current and
"[alumni](alumni.html)" users.**

**We also seek to foster artistic collaborations between musicians and film
makers, choreographers and dancers, literary and theatrical artists, and
professionals and students in a variety of other other fields. The
yearly[IMAGEMOVEMENTSOUND Festival ](http://www.oyzonanimation.com/ISM), co-
produced by the ECMC, the Film/Video/Animation Department of the Rochester
Institute of Technology, and the Graduate Department of Dance at SUNY
Brockport, sponsors the creation of innovative multimedia works by
collaborative groups of two or more artists from our three institutions,
multiple performances of these works within the Rochester area and on a
variety of international venues, and an [Image, Movement,
Music](courses.html#IMS_COURSE) course. In addition to the _IMS Festival_
works, composers from the Center create several musical soundtracks each year
for films produced by faculty and students at RIT and by independent film
makers. Purely musical works realized at the ECMC are presented in concerts
sponsored by the Center and by various other organizations.

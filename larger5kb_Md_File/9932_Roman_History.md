**RESEARCHING THE HISTORY OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC**

**IN THE REFERENCE ROOM**

Our exploration of the history of the Roman Republic begins in the Reference
Room where [ **Reference Books**](rome_ref.html) can offer a starting place
for research. The works on this list are just a sample of what's available.
These titles provide everything from quick lookups, through short essay
overviews, to extensive listings of recent publications on classical themes.
Use them to put your research in context and to answer the who? where? and
when? questions. Note also if the entries include citations for further
readings on the topic.

**FINDING BOOKS**

To complete your background reading, use the **[library online
catalog](http://143.229.1.50/screens/mainmenu.html)** to find books in the
Vassar Library or the
[**WorldCat**](http://firstsearch.oclc.org/done=referer;dbname=WorldCat;FSIP)
to find books in other libraries using subject headings such as:

  * **Rome--History--Republic, 510-30 B.C.**
  * **Slavery--Rome--History--Sources.**
  * **Women--Rome** 

If you plan to get books from other libraries, leave yourself plenty of time
to do [**Interlibrary
Loan**](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/reserves/forms/illforms.html).

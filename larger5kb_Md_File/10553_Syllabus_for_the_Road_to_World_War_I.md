_I. Course Description

_      The subject of the course "The Road to War, 1905-1914" is the immediate
origins of the First World War, with a concentration on the events of
1911-1914.  The core of the course is diplomatic history, examining the string
of crises which led to the outbreak of World War One.  In the process of this,
not only the foreign relations of the major powers but also their internal
politics will be examined in an effort to understand better the comparative
foreign-policy formulation in the different states.  To do this, political
structures and systems of government, nationality problems, and the balance of
power between the government and the populace will be studied.  The course
should make clear the increasing tensions that Europe faced before the war and
the inter-relatedness of the crises of those years.  The course will also
illustrate the different internal and external challenges faced by the states,
how this affected their perceptions and plans, and how reactions varied among
the European states to the same general events.



_II. Course Objectives

_ At its heart, this course seeks to familiarize the students in detail with
the course of events leading to the outbreak of war in 1914.  By the course's
finish, the students should be well acquainted with the major powers, players
and events in the period covered here.  With this knowledge, the students
should be able to make their own decisions about what led Europe to World War
One.

Secondly, beyond familiarizing the students with the various documentary
evidence of the period, the students will develop their abilities to
contextualize documents, will search for their biases, and then will compare
the different sides to support their decisions about the events discussed.

Finally and more broadly, through the study of the historiography of the years
before the war, the course should give them experience with the different ways
in which the same historical evidence can be interpreted, and how to judge
among them.



_III. Course Prerequisites

_ This class has no formal prerequisites.  A knowledge of the history of 19th
and early 20th century Europe or of any of its major powers would be a
significant asset.  At minimum this class requires a willingness to read and
discuss the material on this syllabus.



_IV. Course Format, Preparation, and Presentations

_ This class meets from 5.25pm to 6.40pm every Tuesday and Thursday in 106
Carr.  The sessions themselves will be mainly seminar-style discussions.
Reading assignments each day include all the reading listed for that class.
Students will make presentations to the seminar about the reading.  Among
other things, the presentations should give a brief summary of the item, a
discussion of its main points, and reactions to how it fits in with the other
reading for the day and from previous sessions.  For success in this course,
the students must read the material and come to class ready to discuss it.



_V. Course Evaluation

_ The grade in this course will be determined by the student's performance on
the midterm (30%), on the paper (30%), and in participation and presentations
in class (40%).



_VI. Classroom Rules

_ Aside from the rules given in the Undergraduate Bulletin of Duke University,
there are a few other items that students must keep in mind.  Refusal to
respect these rules will result in a lower grade.

  * Students are expected to come to class on time and remain there until the professor has indicated that the session is over.  Students who must come to class late or leave class early on a regular basis should make the professor aware of the reason ahead of time.  The need to move between campuses is not a sufficient excuse.
  * Drinks may be brought to class, but food is not allowed.
  * Cellphone and beeper noise or use will also not be tolerated.  Students possessing these items should make sure that they are turned off or made silent before class begins.

Reserve area. These include Luigi Albertini's 3 volume _The Origins of the War
of 1914_ , which can be a key source for your papers and supplemental reading.



_VIII. Assignments

__Final Paper:

_ The paper will be due on Tuesday, 5 December.  It should argue a specific
position about one of the crises or events that we have covered in class,
although alternative approaches may be considered.  The student must make use
of both secondary and primary materials, where a minimum of 5 secondary
sources and two primary sources are included, though greater numbers are of
course welcome.  Those students with skills in a foreign language are
encouraged to include materials in those languages.  The paper should be of at
least 15 pages in length, double-spaced with standard margins (1"-1 1/4").
Papers that are handed in late will be penalized one grade step (ie, A- to B+)
for every 24 hours after the due date and time that it was to be handed in.

A paper proposal will be due on November 2.  This should be a one-page
description of what you think your paper will examine.  It should include your
topic (for example, Great Britain in the week before the war) and a tentative
thesis (Britain would have entered the war only if Belgium had been invaded).
This part may be up to a paragraph in length.  It should also include an
annotated bibliography, which lists the books you plan to use for the paper
and gives a sentence or two about how each relates to the topic.

I will read a draft of the paper if turned at least two weeks before the due
date, on a first-come, first-served basis.



_Exam:

_ The midterm exam will be on the 12th of October.  It will be a combination
of short identifications and essays covering the material of the first half of
the course.

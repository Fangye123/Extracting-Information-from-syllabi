**Catalog Description**         **101 General Chemistry (3)**  
A course designed to meet the needs of both non-science majors and students
entering allied health fields. Emphasis is placed on basic chemistry concepts,
giving the student a strong background on a variety of topics in order to
appreciate the role of science and particularly chemistry in modern-day life.
Topics include atomic structure, chemical bonding, stoichiometry, kinetics,
equilibria, and nuclear chemistry. Lecture, three hours per week. Competency
at the mathematics 101 level and beyond is suggested. Chemistry 101 is not
open to students who have taken Chemistry 111 or 112. _Corequisite : Chemistry
101L._

**Attendance Policy**     Attendance is expected at all classes. Students are
responsible for all information presented in class whether they are present or
not. It is imperative that you attend class and also to arrive promptly. It is
extremely rude and discourteous to arrive late. However, it is better to
arrive late than to not come at all. If you arrive late for a quiz, test, or
the final exam, instructions might not be repeated nor might you receive
additional time to complete the assignment. There are no make ups for tests or
quizzes/fast points. Tests or quizzes/fast points may be taken ahead of time
if prior approval is obtained. The lowest test grade will be dropped.

Please note that an [Absence
Memorandum](http://www.cofc.edu/~deavorj/102/absence.htm) only verifies your
documentation for missing a class. It does not entitle you to make up or be
excused from any work, assignment, quiz, or test. You should obtain notes from
a classmate, read the associated material in the text, and then come ask
questions. If you miss picking up a graded quiz or test you should pick it up
from my office as expeditiously as possible.

**Responsibilities** You are responsible for al material covered or assigned
in clss or assigend via the web. You should check the website at least weekly
for any updates. If no specific reading or homework assignments are made in
class you should minimally read ahead at least several sections and attempt
the associated in-chapter and end of chapter problems.

It absolutely vital that you keep current in your studies. An expectation is
made that for every hour spent in lecture that you will spend a minimum of 3
hours of study. The instructor is here to explain the material and help you to
the best of his time and ability. However, the burden of learning is upon the
student.

**Honor Code**         This course is conducted under the Honor Code of the
College of Charleston. The Honor Code specifically forbids lying, cheating,
attempted cheating, stealing, attempted stealing and plagiarism. Students at
the College are bound by honor and by their acceptance of admission to the
College to abide by the Code and to report violations. As members of the
College community, students are expected to evidence a high standard of
personal conduct and to respect the rights of other students, faculty, staff
members, community neighbors, and visitors on campus. Students are also
expected to adhere to all federal, state, and local laws. Faculty members are
required to report violations of the Honor Code or Code of Conduct to the
Office of Student Affairs. Conviction of an Honor Code violation in this class
will result in the the grade of "F" for the course. Please consult the
departments [Policy on Scientific
Integrity](http://www.cofc.edu/~chem/advising/integrity.html).

**Electronics Device Policy**             Devices that are prohibited in class
at any time: pagers, cell phones, radios, TV, CD, DVD, and MP3 players and
similar devices. Keep these devices off and out of sight. Devices that are
allowed to be used at certain times during class, except during tests, exams
and quizzesare mobile computing devices (no bigger than laptops), laptops,
handheld computers, PDAs, electronic pens, calculators, and similar devices.
The sound must be off unless otherwise specified by the instructor. At times
the use of these devices is encouraged. During tests, exams and quizzes: No
electronic devices are allowed to be on or in sight, unless otherwise
specified by the instructor. The use of programmable calcualtors or any
wirless communication device during a quiz, test , or final exam is prohibited
and will be considered a violation of the Honor Code.  

**Math Competency**             Competency at the level of MATH 101, which
includes algebra and graphing, is assumed. Help with math can be obtained from
the CSL. You will need a calculator that can perform logarithmic and
exponential functions (~$15). Bring this calculator to all class meetings. The
use of programmable calcualtors during a quiz, test , or final exam is
prohibited and will be considered a violation of the Honor Code.  

**Office Hours:**     As department chair my office hours are 9:30 am - 4:30
pm. You can access my office via the department office in SCIC 316 or via SCIC
314.

**Co-requisite**     CHEM 101L is a co-requisite course. You must either be
currently enrolled in the lab or else have already passed the lab. If either
is dropped both must be dropped. The two courses (CHEM 101 & 101L) are graded
independently of each other. **The last day to drop with a grade of "W" is
Tuesday October 1, 2002.**

available is a Student Study Guide. **

### Class Objectives

1\. To understand fundamental physical (e.g. boiling point, solubility,
hydrogen bonding capability) and chemical properties (reactivity) of matter  
2\. To write correct IUPAC names for simple inorganic compounds if given the
formula or visa versa  
3\. To write correct structures for organic compounds if given the name (IUPAC
or common) and to distinguish isomers  
4\. To predict the products of reactions or to give the starting materials
needed to produce inorganic compounds  
5\. To predict the shape of simple molecules and to understand how this
affects their physical and chemical properties  
6\. To apply quantitative methods in solving chemical properties  
7\. To understand the historical development of atomic theory  

**General Education Objectives**  
1\. demonstrate an understanding of some of the fundamental scientific
concepts and theories about the natural world;  
2\. acquire knowledge of the evidence, ideas and models that scientists use to
make judgements about the natural world;  
3\. acquire knowledge about science and technology as they shape contemporary
experience and values, and demonstrate an appreciation of the historical and
contemporary impact of science on daily life;  
4\. develop the skills of logical and critical thinking necessary to explore
how the natural world works;  
5\. demonstrate an appreciation and understanding of the scientific method of
inquiry; understand that scientific knowledge is based on the outcome of
testing of hypotheses and theories that are under constant scrutiny and
subject to revision based on new observations, and not just a collection of
facts; and  
6\. demonstrate an ability to distinguish between science and technology and
appreciate the capabilities and limitations of science.

**Projects**     During the semester four optional
[projects](http://www.cofc.edu/~deavorj/101/jpd101pr.html) will be collected
as part of [_Fast Points_](http://www.cofc.edu/~deavorj/101/fastpoints.html).
Projects are due no later than 5 pm on the specified dates. Projects may be
turned in early if desired or may be submitted via electronic mail. Late
projects will not be accepted. Whether you submit a typed copy or a copy via
email, please retain a copy on disk or a hardcopy for yourself of all projects
until you receive your final grade in the course.

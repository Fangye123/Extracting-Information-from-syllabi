Course Description

_

HIST 401 is the third in a series of courses (HIST 301, 302, 401, and 402) on
the history of modern Europe.  Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the
course examines the major themes and events of European history through the
outbreak of the First World War in 1914.  Topics include the rise of
nationalism, liberalism, and socialism, the development of modern politics,
the impact of European imperialism in Asia and Africa, and the crisis of
international diplomacy which ultimately led to World War I.

Attendance

_

Punctual attendance is required, and students arriving after roll is called
are considered absent. **Two unexcused absences are allowed.**   In order to
have absences excused, students should submit the appropriate signed form from
the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs (see pp. 100-101 of the
TSU Student Handbook).   This form is also required for the make-up of missed
exams.  Each unexcused absence beyond the two allowed will lower the class-
participation component of the final grade.

_

Exams

_

Including the final, there are three exams in the course, each consisting of
multiple-choice questions, terms for identification, and one essay question.
Although I will try to have some spares available in case of emergencies,
please remember to bring at least one **small exam book** (blue book) to the
exams.    These should be available in the campus bookstore.

_

Essay

_

An essay of approximately eight pages in length is due by **December 1**.
Essays submitted after this date are subject to a grade reduction of five
points per day.  The regular essay topics, based on the Herwig reader and the
Hochschild book, will be assigned in the course of the semester.  Students may
choose, alternatively, to write on another topic but must, in this case, have
their proposal approved no later than **November 1**.

_

Academic Honesty

_

All students are expected to maintain ethical integrity.  Any instance of
cheating or plagiarism constitutes grounds for the assignment of an F in the
course, and such cases will normally be reported immediately to both the Vice
President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs.

  |  Designed to support a variety of experiential learning needs. Adult
learners with extensive learning from prior experience may receive
acknowledgment of that learning with internship credit upon submission of a
portfolio to an evaluation committee. Younger students with limited experience
will participate in selected non-classroom experiences with relationship to
their educational needs. Students already working full or part-time may apply
to use that experience in fulfillment of the internship requirement. For the
latter two types of students, learning outcomes are established and related
reports and/or projects are submitted each quarter. See EBE 270 Internship for
course description.

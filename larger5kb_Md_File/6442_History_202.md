**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**

![](../../../_themes/history/urbbul1d.gif)|  HIST 202 is the second of a
three-quarter sequence in the History of the United States. This course begins
around 1820 and ends around 1900. It is not necessary to have taken HIST 201
to do well in this course.  
---|---  
![](../../../_themes/history/urbbul1d.gif)| In 1820 the United States was a
rather small nation. By 1900 the United States had rapidly expanded and
controlled most of its present territory. As we will see, the United States'
rapid and often aggressive expansion had an enormous impact on the course of
U.S. history and on the lives of various peoples in North America--Indians,
and Mexicans--who became incorporated, often forcibly, into the United States.
Over the course of the 1800s, the United States changed in several other ways.
It went through major economic and political upheavals, the most important of
which was the Civil War. Not only did the Civil War end slavery, it ushered in
new economic and political changes. As well, the United States changed through
the enormous influx of immigrants from all around the world.  
![](../../../_themes/history/urbbul1d.gif)| As we look at these changes, we
will continually return to one theme: the struggle to realize the promise of
American democracy. The United States was founded on a principle that "all men
are created equal." As we will see, through the nineteenth century, Americans
debated about what those words meant. If all men are created equal, are all
women, too? If all men are created equal, how can slavery be tolerated? These
are just two examples of the kinds of questions that were a part of the
struggle to realize the promise of American democracy.

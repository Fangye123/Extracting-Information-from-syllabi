**THE OTHER EUROPE:**  
**MODERN EASTERN AND CENTRAL EUROPE**  
**  311-31300**

  

**Introduction**  
The countries of Eastern and Central Europe experienced a revolutionary
transformation.  The experiment in the construction of a Moscow sponsored
communist utopia collapsed.  The region's numerous and varied nation states
now follow independent paths of development reflective of each nation's own
unique history, different levels of economic modernization, assorted social
relations and diverse cultural traditions.

The geo-political term "Eastern Europe" does not stand as the only regional
designation.  Several states (Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary and Poland)
identify themselves as part of "Central Europe," thus, the regional
description used for this course includes both Eastern and Central Europe.
The declaration of independence by former republics of the Soviet Union has
increased the number of nation-states within the Eastern and Central European
sphere.  The disintegration of Yugoslavia also raised the number of
independent nation-states in the region.  We shall also examine the important
role played by the former German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

This course will concentrate on developments and events in the post-World War
Two period.  We shall begin with a general historical and cultural overview
predating the principal period of study.  We shall include a closer
examination of Jewish life and institutions and the immigration of many varied
peoples from Eastern and Central Europe and their status, culture and
influence in both America and Europe.  The post-1945 period will be initially
examined in light of common patterns of governance, ideology, politics,
economics, society and culture which bound the region together.  We will then
concentrate on the development of independent dissident activities, ideas,
social change, cultural movements and individuals which challenged the
monolithic authoritarian models throughout the region.  This course will
conclude with a reflection upon contemporary events and transformations in
Eastern and Central Europe and an evaluation of what the future may bring for
this region based upon recent historical and cultural legacies.

**Requirements**  
1.   Each student is required to take two interpretive essay examinations.  Essays will be conceptual in nature and will test student comprehension and analysis of the material covered in class and the readings.  Take careful notes of lectures and discussions.  Review essay questions and objective terms will be distributed one week prior to the examinations.  The final examination will include a comprehensive essay. 

2.   A research paper (10-12 typed pages) is required.  A topic will be selected jointly by the student and professor.  The        paper will then follow several stages: 1.) a thesis statement and bibliography;  2.) an outline;  3.) completion of the paper with possibility of revision.  The paper format will follow guidelines presented in Jules Benjamin's A Student's Guide to History   
<http://www.bedfordbooks.com/history/research/get.htm?page=research_frame.htm>

3.   The semester project will include the following:

minority selected jointly by the student and professor.  
> b.) Brief analytical critiques of the Hoffman, Drakulic and Kundera books.  
> c.) Review of films relevant to the course and three internet sites listed
in the syllabus.

4.  Class participation in thoughtful discussion of assigned readings, topics and creative collaborative group projects is      important. 

5.   Regular attendance is expected of all students.  College policy allows only three unexcused absences.  Absences will adversely affect the comprehension of course material and one's grade. 

6.   Carefully read the sections of the syllabus regarding the writing of essays, papers and plagiarism.

_**Introductory Seminars (100)**_. The introductory seminar is a small
discussion oriented course. Most of these seminars satisfy  "Second Writing
Course" Requirement. These seminars are open to first and second-year students
and are intended to introduce undergraduates to reading, studying, and writing
about history. The sections to be offered during the fall semester will take
up different topics (see following pages), but each will enhance your critical
capacities, sharpen reading and writing skills, and acquaint you with a
variety of ways of apprehending the past. You may choose the section and topic
that you prefer.

_**Most Introductory Seminars are considered "Writing Courses" and will
satisfy the "Second Writing Requirement."**_

  
_**History Seminars**_. History Seminars offer the opportunity to undertake
historical research in an area of the student's interest, in close
consultation with an instructor. Although history majors have priority in
enrollment, sections of the History Seminars are open to students outside the
Department when space permits. Topics vary from semester to semester. Those
offered in the fall of 1998 are listed under 401 or 402 in the following
pages. If you are a History Major, you must earn a grade of  "C" or above (C-
is a failing grade) in 401 or 402. Students should have completed at least two
courses in the general area of the seminar in which they wish to enroll. _**IN

Distinguished Majors Program**

The History Department initiated its Distinguished Majors Program in the fall
of 1984. This is the normal channel for obtaining a degree with Distinction,
High Distinction, and Highest Distinction.

The Distinguished Major Program offers the opportunity for independent
research culminating in the writing of a substantial thesis. Participants will
enter a special colloquium (HIST 405) in the fall of their third year for an
intensive introduction to the methods and varieties of historical analysis.
During the fourth year, they will prepare their theses.

The Distinguished Majors Program is selective. Students must show a capacity
for independent study and must have, roughly, a 3.4 GPA. For more information
and applications, see Mr. Braun (Randall Hall 219). Applications are due
Wednesday, April 10.

**HIEU 100, SCT. A INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR** **** Ms. Sophie Rosenfeld

"Enlightenment Utopias"

This seminar will explore the nature and legacy of the Enlightenment through a
consideration of its relation to utopianism. In the first part of the course,
we will turn our attention to some of the ways 18th-century European and
American writers used the idea of reason both to critique certain key aspects
of the culture and society in which they lived and to sketch alternative
visions of human existence. Our reading will include literary attempts to
imagine life in distant places and times (i.e. Mercer, _The Year 2440: A Dream
If Ever There Was One_ ), practical plans for "enlightened" society reforms
(i.e. Becarria, _Of Crimes and Punishments_ ), and, finally, revolutionary
efforts to reconstitute the fundamental premises of the existing social and
political order (i.e. the _Federalist_ and  "The Declaration of the Rights of
Man"). Then, in the second part of the course, we will turn to some of the
critiques that these visions--and the very idea of using abstract reason to
change the world--provoked at the close of the 18th century and the beginning
of the new one. Authors in this part of the course will include Edmund Burke,
Mary Shelley, and the Marquis de Sade. The chief purpose of this course will
be to introduce students to some of the most important texts of this era and
to encourage them to use these primary sources to reflect on the achievements
and limitations of Enlightenment thought and its legacy for modernity.

Requirements for the course will be active participation in weekly class
discussions of the readings, one in-class presentation, and two 8-10 page
papers. The class satisfies the Second Writing Requirement.



**HIEU 100, SCT. B INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR** **** Ms. Anne J. Schutte

"Early Modern Life-Writing"

Autobiography has been called "an unnatural act." Those few who conceive the
project of writing, or dictating, their life stories have in mind a purpose
and an audience. In late medieval and early modern Europe, the purpose was
often to trace a path from sin to redemption. The audience was usually God and
a select group of people who might profit from learning about the life-
writer's achievements and mistakes.

The course will focus on several of the following texts, ranging from the
fifteenth to the eighteenth century and originating in a variety of places and
contexts, along with some appropriate modern scholarly studies:

Julian of Norwich (1343-1414), _Revelations of Divine Love_  
Margery Kempe (1373-1440), _The Book of Margery Kempe_  
Ignatius Loyola (1491-1556), _Personal Writings_  
Benvenuto Cellini (1500-1571), _Autobiography_  
Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), _Life_  
Cecilia Ferrazzi (1609-1684), _Autobiography of an Aspiring Saint_  
John Bunyan (1628-1688), _Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners_  
Gl uckel of Hameln (1645-1724), _Memoirs of Gl uckel of Hameln_

We shall explore the life-writers' social, political, religious, and
existential situations; their relations with others (human and divine); their
understandings of themselves as gendered persons; the ways in which they
conceived and crafted their life stories; and the "truth value" of these tales
about the self.

Reading: about 200 pages per week. Writing: several short essays and a medium-
sized research paper. This course fulfills the Second Writing Requirement.



**HIEU 201 WESTERN CIVILIZATION** **** Mr. Paul Kershaw

This course will introduce and place in perspective the essential features of
the human experience in the western world from ancient Mesopotamia to the
Reformation. Political and institutional developments, social organization and
political ideas, art, architecture, literature, philosophy and religion will
all receive attention. Basically, this is the course where you will encounter
all those things you have always known you ought to know, and find out why you
felt you ought to know them. Readings will be drawn from a course textbook and
a series of primary sources ranging from the very earliest literature of
ancient Mesopotamia through to the writings of Martin Luther, taking in Homer,
the Bible, Cicero, Peter Abelard and Dante along on the way. Reading will
average about 125 pages per week.

The courses consists of three lectures and a discussion section each week.

Students will complete three hour-long examinations and write four three to
four page papers.

Required Reading:

T.F.X. Noble, et al., _Western Civilization. The Continuing Experiment_ , 3rd

There will be required one mid-term test, an essay on an approved topic
related to the work of the course and due on the last day of class, and a
final examination.

This course is open to all undergraduates.



**HIEU 210 MODERN JEWISH HISTORY** **** Mr. Gabriel Finder

The unbroken history of the Jewish people, especially in modern Europe, has
been altered by dramatic interruptions. Even before the Shoah (the Holocaust),
the conflicting forces of continuity and change characterized the development
of the Jewish people in modern Europe, with attendant repercussions throughout
the Jewish world, both elsewhere in the Diaspora and in (the Land of) Israel.
Among these momentous changes in modern Jewish life were the transformation of
the Jews (especially in Western and Central Europe) from a religious community
into citizens of their respective countries, religious reformation, the
emergence and increasing dominance of autonomist concepts of Jewish identity,
in particular Zionism and Jewish socialism (Bundism), and large-scale
migration to America and Palestine. The Shoah and the creation of the state of
Israel pose a new challenge to the continuity of Jewish life in the Diaspora.
This leitmotiv of continuity amid change will shape our examination of the
history of the Jewish people in its modern European context. Major topics
include Jewish historical consciousness; patterns of emancipation,
assimilation, adaptation, and migration; religious adjustment; the role of
women; anti-Semitism; Zionism; the American Jewish experience; the Shoah; the
reestablishment of a Jewish State in Israel; and Jewish life in Europe after
the Shoah.

This course is intended to acquaint students with the study of modern European
Jewish history and assumes no prior training in Jewish history. Class meetings
will combine lecture and discussion. There exists an extensive body of
literature on modern European Jewish history. Assigned books may include Jacob
Katz, _Out of the Ghetto: The Social Background of Jewish Emancipation,
1770-1870_ ;Moshe Rosman, _Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical
Ba'al Shem Tov_ ; Zvi Gitelman, _A Century of Ambivalence: The Jews of Russia
and the Soviet Union, 1881 to the Present_ ; Ezra Mendelsohn, _On Modern
Jewish Politics_ ; Jenna Weissman Joselit, _The Wonders of America:
Reinventing Jewish Culture, 1880-1950_ ; Saul Friedlander, _Nazi Germany and
the Jews_ ; Anita Shapira, _Land and Power: The Zionist Resort to Force,
1881-1948_ ; and Michael Brenner, _After the Holocaust: Rebuilding Jewish
Lives in Postwar Germany_. Many of the reading assignments will come from
primary sources: diaries, memoirs, interviews; novels, short stories, and
folktales. Excerpts from primary documents will be assigned in large part from
Paul Mendes-Flohr and Jehuda Reinharz, eds., _The Jew in the Modern World: A
Documentary Reader_ (2d ed.). In addition, possible primary texts include _The
Memoirs of Gl uckel of Hameln_; _The Tales of Nahman of Bratslav_ ; Sholem
Aleichem, _Tevye the Dairyman and the Railroad Stories_ ; Hannah Krall's
interview with Marek Edelman, the last surviving leader of the Warsaw Ghetto
Uprising, in _To Outwit God_ ; and Henryk Grynberg, _The Victory_. Moreover,
in class we will examine music and the visual arts. Course requirements will
include three short writing assignments (5 pages), a final exam, and
conscientious participation in class discussion.



**HIEU 211 ENGLISH HISTORY TO 1688** **** Mr. Paul Halliday

This course surveys England's history from the end of the Roman occupation of
Britain-one period of invasion-to 1688-another invasion. We shall look at the
meaning of the arrival of Christianity, politics and society before the Norman
Conquest, the impact of that Conquest, and the nature of social life in the
later Middle Ages. From there we will examine the Reformation and the
catastrophic civil wars of the mid-seventeenth century and the transformations
they wrought in English politics and society.

This course consists of two lectures and a discussion section each week. Each
student will write two short essays (4-5pp) and will take a mid-term and a
final exam.

Assigned books may include:

C. Warren Hollister, _The Making of England, 55 B.C. to 1399_  
Lacey Baldwin Smith, _This Realm of England, 1399-1688_  
Asser, _Life of Alfred the Great_  
Christopher Haigh, _English Reformations: Religion, Politics, and Society
under the Tudors_  
Barbara Hanawalt, _The Ties that Bound: Peasant Families in Medieval England_  
Lawrence Stone, _The Causes of the English Revolution: 1529-1642_

150-200 pages per week.



**HIEU 215 RUSSIA FROM PETER THE GREAT TO LENIN, 1700-1917** **** Mr. Robert
Geraci

HIEU 215 is a survey of Russia from the Petrine reforms to the end of tsarist
rule and the Bolshevik takeover. During this period the Romanov dynasty, in
order to bring Russia into the ranks of European and world powers, attempted
to transform the country economically, socially, and culturally, and extended
Russian rule to ever more territories and populations. At the same time, those
in power insisted on preserving many of Russia's traditional and distinctive
features, including its autocratic political system. These conflicting
agendas, and the way in which they led ultimately to social and political
breakdown, will be a central theme of the course.

Approximately half the course will be devoted to the last sixty years of the
tsarist period -- from defeat in the Crimean War and implementation of the so-
called Great Reforms (beginning with the abolition of serfdom) -- concluding
with close analysis of the revolutionary eruptions of 1905 and 1917. Special
attention will be paid to the governance of and interaction among the various
national and ethnic groups within the Russian empire.

Students will attend two lectures and one discussion section (led by a TA) per
week, and will be expected to read 100-150 pages per week. Grades will be
based on a midterm exam, a short paper, a final exam, and participation in
section. There is no prerequisite for the course.

The basic texts will be Walter Moss, _A History of Russia_ , vol. 1; and James
Cracraft, ed., _Major Problems in the History of Imperial Russia_. Primary
source readings will include novels (Ivan Turgenev, _Fathers and Sons_ , and
Leo Tolstoy, _Hadji Murad_ ); a play (Nikolai Gogol, _The Inspector General_
); and selections from the memoirs of Russian revolutionaries (Engel and
Rosenthal, eds., _Five Sisters: Women against the Tsar_ ).



**HIEU 304 THE FALL OF THE ROMAN REPUBLIC** **** Ms. Elizabeth Meyer

This upper-level lecture class assumes a basic knowledge of Roman history. It
will cover the most tumultuous period in Roman history, that which stretches
from 133 B.C. to the establishment of Octavian (Augustus) as the first emperor
in 27 B.C. This was the age of the great generals (Marius, Sulla, Pompey,
Caesar); of great oratory (Cicero), of amazing changes in the city of Rome
itself, in Italy, and in the ever-growing provinces; an age of shifting
political alliances, howling crowds, and the eventual transformation of a
Republic into a monarchy. How did this come about? Could the Republic maintain
an empire, or was the dominance of one man unavoidable? We will read mostly
primary sources in translation, averaging about 140 pages a week; there will
be sporadic discussions, a midterm, a final, one 5-6 page paper, and one 10-12
page paper. Reading will be drawn from:

H.H. Scullard, _From the Gracchi to Nero_ (fifth edition, 1982)  
Plutarch, _Makers of Rome and The Fall of the Roman Republic_  
Sallust, _Jugurthine War and Conspiracy of Catiline_  
Julius Caesar, _Civil Wars and Gallic War_ (selections)  
M. Tullius Cicero, _On Government, Selected Letters, and Selected Political
Speeches_  
Q. Tullius Cicero, handbook on electioneering  
and a course packet



**HIEU 323/RELC 326 REFORMATION EUROPE** **** Ms. Anne J. Schutte

In this course we examine developments in Western Europe from the late Middle
Ages through the many forms of religious reorientation that emerged in the
sixteenth century to the end of what some historians have called "the iron
century." The approach is to some extent selective and topical: we will pay
closer attention to religion, society, and culture than to dynastic politics
and military conflicts per se. In addition to a textbook, DeLamar Jensen's
_Reformation Europe_ (2nd ed.), readings include abundant primary sources of
all sorts and several fascinating short studies of individual participants in
the events of this era. By early April a tentative reading list will be posted
outside Randall 110.

Structure: lecture with frequent discussion. Reading: about 175 pages per
week. Writing: two medium-length papers; a midterm and a final examination.
Fulfills Second Writing Requirement.



**HIEU 332 SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION** **** Ms. Karen Parshall

This course examines the development of scientific thought and institutions in
Western Europe during the critical period from 1450 to 1700 known as the
Scientific Revolution. Because those engaged in scientific pursuits during
this period were very consciously reacting to the thought of their
predecessors, the course opens with a survey of developments in science from
classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages. With the reintroduction
throughout the Renaissance of ancient Greek and Roman texts, scientific
thinkers and philosophers both adapted and rejected classical thought in
formulating their own interpretations of the phenomena observable in the
natural world around them. As a result of their efforts, "new" versions of
"old" sciences emerged, and areas such as astronomy and astrology, chemistry
and alchemy, coexisted within the accepted body of scientific knowledge. Open
to all undergraduates, this course---primarily in the history of ideas---
requires no prior training in the sciences or in European history.

Classes will be conducted in a lecture/discussion style. Students will write
one short (5-7-page) paper, a research prospectus and annotated bibliography,
and a (12-15-page) research paper, in addition to taking a final examination.
(This course satisfies the Second Writing Requirement.)

Readings will average 100 pages each week and will be drawn from a photocopied
packet containing excerpts from the works of such writers as Plato, Aristotle,
Ptolemy, Galen, Bacon, Kepler, Paracelsus, Harvey, Galileo, and Newton, as
well as from the following required texts:

Debus, _Man and Nature in the Renaissance_  
Descartes, _Discourse on Method_  
Lindberg, _The Beginnings of Western Science_  
Galileo, _Sidereus Nuncius_  
Williams and Steffens, _The History of Western Science_ , vol. 2



**HIEU 337 IMPACT OF PRINTING, 1650-1850** **** Mr. Terry Belanger

This lecture course examines broadly the impact of the printing press on
western European culture. In addition to regular classes, there are laboratory
sessions in which students set type by hand and print the results on a wooden
common press.

Topics to be covered include:

The growth of printing. The development of the idea of the freedom of the
press and of the idea of copyright; authors and publishers. The impact of
printing on the Industrial Revolution, and vice versa: the effect of printed
illustrations on the rise of science and technology. Printing and education:
literacy and the development of the popular press. The impact of printing on
the visual and performing arts.

The course will make use of the Book Arts Press's teaching collections of
original printed materials from c17 to the c20.

Readings will average 150-200 pages per week. Students will write two papers
of about 10 pages each (80% of course grade), and there will be a final
examination (20% of course grade).

There are no prerequisites for the course, but some general knowledge of
European history is desirable.

**HIEU 338 REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE, 1770-1815** **** Ms. Sophie Rosenfeld

This course will examine the social, cultural, intellectual, and political
history of France from the end of the Old Regime through the Napoleonic
Empire. The origins, development, and outcome of the French Revolution will be
our main focus. Attention will also be given to the impact of events in France
on other western nations and to the legacy of the French Revolution in terms
of such modern concepts as human rights, nationalism, welfare, feminism,
democracy, and revolution itself. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the
different and often conflicting ways in which historians have interpreted the
meaning and consequences of this critical moment of upheaval. Class meetings
will combine lecture and discussion of weekly readings, including Darnton,
_The Great Cat Massacre_ ; Lefebvre, _The Coming of the French Revolution_ ;
Tocqueville, _The Old Regime and the French Revolution_ ; and numerous primary
sources, from revolutionary festival programs to Al-Jabarti's chronicle of
Napoleon in Egypt. The requirements of the course are one 8-10 page paper, a
midterm exam, and a final.



**HIEU 345 EUROPEAN HISTORY, 1890-1950** **** Mr. Stephen A. Schuker

This course will address international politics, domestic governance, and
ideological developments in the first half of the twentieth century. The
course will emphasize nationalism, imperialism, and the causes and
consequences of the two world wars. It will relate social dislocation,
failures of democratic governments, and the rise of totalitarianism,
challenges to capitalism, and the Depression to the changing place of Europe
in the world.



**HIEU 353/GETR 354 JEWISH CULTURE AND HISTORY IN EASTERN EUROPE** Mr. Gabriel
N. Finder and Mr. Jeffrey A. Grossman

This course is a comprehensive examination of the culture and history of East
European Jewry from 1750 to 1939. If what it meant to be Jewish in Poland,
Russian, and the rest of Eastern Europe was still self-evident in the middle
of the eighteenth century, Jewish self-definition, both individually and
collectively, became afterwards increasingly contingent and open-ended. Before
its destruction in the Shoah (Holocaust), Jewish life in Eastern Europe was
characterized by a plethora of emerging possibilities. This course explores
this vibrant and dynamic process of change and self-definition. It traces the
emergence of new forms of Jewish experience, and it shows their unfolding in a
series of lively and poignant dramas of tradition and transformation, division
and integration, dreams and nightmares. The course seeks to grasp this world
through the lenses of culture and history, and to explore the different ways
in which these disciplines illuminate the past. The course will discuss
various themes, including the birth of Hasidism, traditional Jewish life in
the Jewish hamlet (shtetl), gender relations, modern Jewish political
formations, the emergence of modern Hebrew and Yiddish literature, Jewish
urbanization, and Jewish life in the interwar period.

This course is intended to acquaint students with the study of East European
Jewish culture and history and assumes no prior training in the subject. Class
meetings will combine lecture and discussion. Assigned scholarly books may
include Moshe Rosman, _Founder of Hasidism: A Quest for the Historical Ba'al
Shem Tov_ , Ezra Mendelsohn, _On Modern Jewish Politics_ , and Ruth Wisse,
_I.L. Peretz and the Making of Modern Jewish Culture_. However, most of the
reading assignments will come from primary sources -novels, short stories,
folktales, diaries, memoirs, and interviews, including Lucy Dawidowicz, ed.,
_The Golden Tradition_ , Nahman of Bratslav, _The Tales_ ; Sholem Abramovitsh,
_Tales of Mendele the Bookpeddlar_ ; Sholem Aleichem, _Tevye the Dairyman and
The Railroad Stories_ ; I. L. Peretz, _Selected Stories_ ; S. Ansky, _The
Dybbuk_ ; and Jack Kugelmass and Jonathan Boyarin, eds. _From a Ruined Garden:
The Memorial Books of Polish Jewry_. In class we will also examine East
European Jewish music and visual arts. Course requirements will include two
5-page essays and a 10-page term paper as well as conscientious participation
in class discussion. This course will fulfill the second writing assignment.



**HIEU 354 GERMAN HISTORY, 1914-2000** **** Mr. Alon Confino

This course introduces students to the history of Germany in the twentieth
century. It explores the social, political, and cultural history of Germany at
this period, from the Great War, through Weimar, the Third Reich, war and
extermination, to national division between East and West, and finally
reunification and European integration.

Among the themes that will be explored are ideologies and political structures
(Nazism, communism and liberal democracy), everyday life in Nazi and East
Germany, dictatorships and consent, the Holocaust and coming to terms with its
past, and the development of mass culture.

We shall analyze the creation between 1945-1990 of two distinct social,
cultural, and political systems in the two Germanies and its implications for
the future. Stress will be placed on the variety of historical options that
were opened for Germany before the rise of Nazism in 1933. In this course, the
main question that will guide us in our understanding of German history is the
following: How does one think about the history of Germany's twentieth century
so as to embrace the transformation from the dark Germany of war and genocide
to a nation characterized by democracy and prosperity at century's end?



**HIEU 372 WITCHCRAFT** **** Mr. H. C. Erik Midelfort

This course considers the history and theory of Western magic and witchcraft
from the points of view of women's studies, European history, and Christian
theology. We study various notions of magic and demonology and their
intersection with witch hunting, especially in Europe and America,
concentrating on the period 1450-1750. We also consider the connections of
modern Wicca (sometimes known as the Goddess religion) to traditional
witchcraft. Students will write a major research paper (10-15 pages long) on a
topic of their choosing. The course proceeds by lectures and discussion of
weekly reading assignments of ca. 100-150 pages a week. Additional assignments
encourage students to discover resources in the library. A midterm and final
examination are required of all. Required reading includes:

Selections from the Bible, Old and New Testaments  
Heinrich Institoris and Jakob Sprenger, _Malleus Maleficarum_ , tr. Summers  
Wolfgang Behringer, Shaman of Oberstdorf. _Chonrad Stoeckhlin and the Phantoms

**HIEU 380 ORIGINS OF CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT** **** Mr. Allan Megill

The course examines some important topics in intellectual history from
Darwin's Origin of Species (1859) onward. The course does not claim to survey
the intellectual history of the period in question. Instead it focuses on a
few important themes--themes that I take to be important for understanding the
historical background to current theoretical reflection. The themes that we
shall consider include: (1) the decline of belief in the notion of a single,
progressive historical process, a notion that dominated much of nineteenth-
century thought; (2) the rise of the notion of a pre-rational or irrational
unconscious, which paralleled doubts concerning the rational ordering of the
world in general; (3) the emergence of "aestheticism" and of "crisis thought";
and (4) the emergence of new views of interpretation and of science. The
overall theme is the presence of, and challenges to, the notion that there is
a rationality embedded in the world.

Reading (in order of use) includes: Charles Darwin, _The Origin of Species_
(Penguin), Friedrich Nietzsche, _The Birth of Tragedy_ (Penguin) and _The
Genealogy of Morals_ (Hackett), Allan Megill, _Prophets of Extremity:
Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida_ (California), Nietzsche, _The
Portable Nietzsche_ , ed. and trans. Kaufmann (Penguin), Sigmund Freud, _The
Interpretation of Dreams_ (Discus Avon) and _Civilization and Its Discontents_
(Norton), and Martin Heidegger, _Being and Time_ (State University of New York
Press). There will be a small set of toolkit readings.

Course Requirements: weekly "think questions," midterm, synthesizing term
paper, final exam. The term paper and final carry heavy weight.



**HIEU 401, SCT. A HISTORY SEMINAR** ** "** **DELETED "**



**HIEU 401, SCT. B HISTORY SEMINAR** **** Mr. Stephen Schuker

"The Holocaust"

This course will address the Holocaust against European Jewry, 1939-1945.
Preliminary readings will introduce students to the historiography on German-
Jewish relations after emancipation; Nazi discrimination against the Jews,
1933-39; the development of extermination policies in the context of World War
II; and the fate of the survivors. Students will write an original 25-page
paper, focusing either on victims, perpetrators, bystanders, or survivors." (I
do not include additional data on format or eligibility because the department
offers several 401 courses, and they all have similar formats.)

The course meets weekly in seminar format. Enrollment is limited to 12.



**HIEU 402, SCT A HISTORY COLLOQUIUM** **** Mr. Robert Geraci

"Russian Intellectual and Cultural History, 1800-1917"

This colloquium will explore selected topics in the thought and culture in the
last century of the tsarist period. During this time, the juxtaposition of a
growing literate and educated public and an obstinately autocratic state
allowing for no significant popular participation had the result that the
intellectual sphere carried an especially heavy burden of social and political
significance. We will spend a good deal of time, therefore, looking at the
contexts, audiences, and influence of ideas on matters such as the relation of
individual to society; reform and revolution; the identity of Russia; and
definitions of art. We will be asking: can/should 19th century Russian
"intellectual" life be studied as a distinct and abstract field, or was it
frequently inseparable from "cultural history" in a socially broader sense?
What links existed between the intellectual production of elites and the
mental world of the less educated masses?

Secondary reading will be mostly from James Billington, _The Icon and the Axe:
An Interpretive History of Russian Culture_ and W. Bruce Lincoln, _Between
Heaven and Hell: A Thousand Years of Artistic Life in Russia_. Primary
readings will include selections from Edie, Scanlan, Zeldin and Kline,
_Russian Philosophy_ , vols. 1-2; A. S. Pushkin, _Eugene Onegin_ ; Alexander
Herzen, _My Past and Thoughts_ ; Nikolai Chernyshevsky, _What Is To Be Done?_
; F. M. Dostoevsky, _Crime and Punishment_ ; L. N. Tolstoy, _Confession_ ; and
Andrei Bely, _Petersburg_.

Grades will be based on three interpretive-analytical papers (two of 5-6 pages
each, and a longer one of 12-15 pages), as well as participation in class
discussion (25%). Students must have either previous background in Russian
history (preferably HIEU 215 or HIEU 361) OR permission of the instructor.



**HIEU 404 INDEPENDENT STUDY IN EUROPEAN HISTORY** **** Staff

In exceptional circumstances and with the permission of a faculty member any
student may undertake a rigorous program of independent study designed to
explore a subject not currently being taught or to expand upon regular
offerings. Independent Study projects may not be used to replace regularly
scheduled classes. Enrollment is open to majors or non-majors.



**HIEU 503 GREECE IN THE FOURTH CENTURY** **** Ms. Elizabeth Meyer

This is an advanced course in Greek history (in discussion-seminar format)
that examines in detail the period from the end of the Peloponnesian War in
404 B.C. to the defeat of the Greek city-states at Chaeronea in 338. It is
particularly concerned with the social and economic, as well as the political,
history of the fourth century; this means that the focus will be chiefly on
Athens rather than on the other city-states or the "nation-state" of Macedon.
The major aim of the class will be to write a twenty- to twenty-five-page
research paper (to be submitted in draft first); in addition to this there
will be five two-page exercises on evidence and method due throughout the
term. The course fulfills the second writing requirement. Readings will be
drawn from the following:

Xenophon, _Hellenica_ (A History of My Times, trans. R. Warner)  
_Greek Political Oratory_ (trans. A.N.W. Saunders, Penguin, 1970)  
A.N. Saunders, ed. _Demosthenes and Aeschines_ (Penguin, 1975)  
P. Harding, _From the End of the Peloponnesian War to the Battle of Ipsos_
(sourcebook; Cambridge, 1985)  
J. Ober, _Mass and Elite in Classical Athens_ (Princeton, 1989)  
Plutarch, _The Rise and Fall of Athens and The Age of Alexander_  
Aeneas Tacticus, _How to Survive Under Siege_ (trans. D. Whitehead, Oxford,
1990; recommended)  
Diodorus Siculus vols. 6 and 7 (Loeb; recommended)

**HIEU 507 MODERN THEORY: MARX, ARENDT, FOUCAULT, SARTRE** **** Mr. Allan
Megill

In this course we shall examine four major "modern" theorists: Karl Marx,
Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault. There is an interesting
contrast between Marx and the others, and one focus of the course will be on
exploring that contrast. Marx was still a believer in progress: Arendt,
Sartre, and Foucault, on the other hand, were "crisis" or "post-crisis" who
could no longer rely on "the firm basis of traditional values" (as Arendt put
it in 1946). Our modus operandi will be to combine a very selective reading in
the secondary literature with readings of major works by each writer.
Characteristically, each week I shall begin by speaking for 15 minutes or so,
in an attempt to situate the reading for that week and to pose some
interesting issues. We shall then engage in discussion of the reading.
Students should have some background in political theory, intellectual
history, philosophy, or philosophically-oriented religious studies.

The syllabus for this offering of the course has not yet been set up, although
you can find the fall 2001 version in the syllabi section of my personal home
page, which is most easily found by searching "Allan Megill" in
www.altavista.com. Works from which we shall likely read include Marx, _Early
Writings_ , Arendt, _Eichmann in Jerusalem_ and _The Human Condition_ ;
Foucault, _Essential Works_ , vol. 1; and Sartre, _Being and Nothingness_.
Students who are interested in the class might consider approaching me before
August (megill@virginia.edu); their conversations with me might well have some
effect on the syllabus, which I expect to revise in early August. As an
interim measure, I recommend four very interesting biographies: Elisabeth
Young-Bruehl, _Hannah Arendt: For Love of the World_ ; Francis Wheen, _Karl
Marx_ ; Annie Cohen-Solal, _Sartre: A Life_ ; and David Macey, _The Lives of
Michel Foucault_. Note also that there exists a _Cambridge Companion to_...
for Marx, Sartre, and Foucault. These volumes give some entry to philosophical
discussion of the writers in question.

The course is intended to provide an opportunity for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates to explore one or another of these thinkers in depth.
Characteristically, the class is taken by students who would like to write a
fairly substantial paper on one of the four thinkers, or on some theme that
was important for one or more of them. Students write a 20-25 page paper; they
are also expected to do the reading, to contribute to discussion, to write up
class minutes on occasion, and to offer reports on their reading on occasion.



**HIEU 517 MEDIEVAL SOCIETY. WORDS AND PICTURES IN THE MIDDLE AGES.** **** Mr.
Everett U. Crosby  

Studies in the history of medieval life and thought based on an analysis and
discussion of a number of key texts and related images in selected manuscript
illustrations. Topics for consideration will include scenes of martyrdom and
the cult of saints, coronation ceremonies, crusading warfare, tournaments, the
stag hunt, Books of Hours, the calendar year, church symbolism, the art of
love, the bestiary, the castle, the apocalypse and visions of the afterlife.

There will be required several oral reports, an essay on an approved topic
related to the work of the course and due the last day of class, and a final
examination.

This course is open to undergraduates, as well as to graduate students.



**HIEU 521 EARLY MODERN GERMAN HISTORY, 1350-1750** **** Mr. H. C. Erik
Midelfort

This course introduces the variety and complexity of the German lands between
about 1400 and 1750. We will consider German legal, social, political,
religious, and medical history. The class covers the Lutheran Reformation, the
German peasants' war of 1525, and the surge of witch hunting of the 16th and
17th centuries. One class will be devoted to the history of art and another to
the history of music. We will consider the history of the Jews of Germany and
the history of women. Although qualified undergraduates are welcome even if
they are not prepared to work in a foreign language, graduate students must be
ready to use at least one of their foreign languages, preferably German. The
required reading for the class covers a book a week, or roughly 250 pages each
week. Students will write a paper (ca. 10 pages) surveying the literature on
some topic that interests them. The main work of the course is the weekly
discussions of challenging work on the cutting edge of research.

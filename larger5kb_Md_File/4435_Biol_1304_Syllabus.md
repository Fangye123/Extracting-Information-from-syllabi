## Final Exam Info:

#### The final exam is Saturday May 4 from 3:00 to 6:00 PM.

The final is worth 200 points (twice as many as the mid-term exams) and will
be formatted in two parts:

> Part I (100 points): Covers the last section of the class, Ecology, since
the third exam  
>  Part II (100 points): Cumulative over the whole semester

Each part of the exam will have the same format as earlier exams: true/false,
multiple choice, and short answer.  
Each part of the exam will get a separate score out of 100 points and for
purposes of the "drop your lowest exam score" policy they will be considered
separated. In other words, if Part I or Part II of the final, by itself, turns
out to be your lowest score, that part of the final is what will be dropped.

**Important:** You will be allowed to have with you during the exam _one_ (1)
8-1/2 x 11 page of notes. You can write anything you want on this page, you
can use both sides, you can type it or print it or write it-- it is
_completely_ up to you. I recommend that you use the page for notes on the
cumulative section of the final, since that material is less recently familiar
to you, and that you use it to organize your information and give yourself
reminders of important points, rather than trying to squeeze every detail of
the whole semester onto it. However, the decision is yours.

##  Second Extra Credit: _[Study Questions from the Extra Credit Assignment
here](FinalStudy.html)_

#### Several students have told me that the first extra credit assignment
helped them study for the last exam, so we'll do it again for the final:

> Submit a list of potential multiple-choice questions that could be used on
the final exam. The final will have two parts, you can submit questions for
each part.

>

> Part I: This will cover 10 lectures (from "Principles of Ecology" to
"Conservation 3" and _including_ the film,  "Little Creatures that Run the
World") and you can submit one (1) question per lecture.  
>  Part II: This part of the final is cumulative. You can submit up to ten
(10) questions for part II.  
>  With both parts together, you can submit up to a maximum of 20 questions

>

> Here are the requirements for the questions:

>

>> 1\. It must be a multiple-choice question with 4 options  
>  2\. The question must be relevant to the material from the source lecture  
>  3\. You must indicate which of the 4 options you intend as the correct
answer, and the answer you indicate must actually _be_ the right answer.

>

> Each question that meets these three requirements will be worth 1 point, for
a total of 20 points available on this assignment.  
>  You may turn in this assignment by e-mail, or as hardcopy.

>

> If you hand it in, it must be either typed or computer printed. _No
exceptions_ to this rule! _No handwritten_ papers will be counted!

>

> I will choose the one or two best questions I receive and actually put them
on the exam-- so if you write good questions, you might get an extra bonus of
seeing your question on the exam and already knowing the answer.

>

> A selection of other questions will be posted here on the web page as extra
study questions.

>

> **Due date for this assignment: _Monday April 29 (last day of classes) in
class_**

LECTURE:  
MWF 2:00 - 2:50 PM, 119 Fondren Science

GRADING:  
There will be three regular exams of 100 points each, and a cumulative final
exam of 200 points, for a total of 500 points for the lecture part of the
course. The final grade in the class will combine lecture and lab scores, with
70% of the grade determined by the lecture and 30% by the lab. _New: the
lowest exam score will be dropped, so the total points will be only 400. The
200 point final counts as two exams, you will be able to drop either part I or
part II separately if it turns out to be your lowest score._

_Exam policy:  
_ I do not reschedule exams based on "exam clusters" with other classes.  
If you have a University-related commitment that will not allow you to take an
exam at the scheduled time, you must contact me _in advance_ to arrange an
alternate time. You will need to provide documentation of the commitment. If
you miss an exam due to a medical problem, contact me as soon as possible with
a _doctor's_ written note saying _specifically_ that you were too ill to
attend class. Vague notes that you have been  "under stress" will not be
accepted.  
You will _not_ be allowed to reschedule exams for family vacations,
sorority/fraternity events, or other recreational activities.

_Course Web Page:  
_ This course web page is the site for up-to-the-minute announcements, changes
to the syllabus, etc. In addition, the online web page will have copies of the
graphics and images for each day's lecture  
Every Friday, the course web page will have study questions you can use to
check your mastery of the material.  
CLASS SYLLABUS: This schedule is subject to change during the semester!

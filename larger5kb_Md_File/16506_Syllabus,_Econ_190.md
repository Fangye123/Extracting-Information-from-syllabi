**Syllabus**  
Meetings: Th 3:10 - 6:00 p.m., 283 Dwinelle  
Revision of January 31, 2002

  
This syllabus is the contract between you and me. Please read it carefully. "I
didn't read the syllabus" is not an acceptable excuse for overlooking an
assignment, being late, and so on.             Prof. Olney

Economics 190 is a special topics seminar -- a seminar course where the topics
change from semester to semester. In this seminar we will focus on developing
skills in economic analysis, writing, and oral presentation. The topic we will
focus on is the economics of discrimination.

Not all difference results from discrimination. Not all discrimination results
in observable differences. This course will focus on issues of difference and
discrimination associated with race, gender, or nation of birth, focusing
particularly on markets other than the labor market. Is there evidence of
discrimination in credit markets? Housing markets? In education? What lessons
can we learn from the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries? How is
econometrics used to address questions of discrimination?

Economics 190 must be taken for a grade if it is to be used toward the
requirements for the major.

**_Responsibilities: Mine and Yours_**  
My responsibilities are to design appropriate class activities, come to class
prepared, encourage class participation, promptly grade papers, be available
during scheduled office hours and for scheduled appointments, and stimulate an
enthusiasm for economics, for research, and for learning.

Your responsibilities are to attend and participate in class three hours per
week, complete all readings by the date shown on the syllabus, complete all
assignments on time, take one midterm, and write and present a term paper.

**_Special Accommodations_**  
If you require special accommodations due to learning or other disability,
please speak with Professor Olney **no later than _February 5_.** You will
eventually need to obtain the evaluation form from Disabled Students' Program
(260 C esar Chavez Student Center).

**_Letter of Introduction_**  
For our second meeting, please write a one-page letter of introduction of
yourself to Professor Olney. Include your name and anything about yourself
that you would like to share. It may be typed or handwritten. It may be
brought to class on January 31 or sent by e-mail to Prof. Olney. It will not
be graded nor returned.

**_Academic Honesty Policy_**  
In fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be treated
harshly. Any evidence of cheating will result in a score of zero (0) on that
assignment or paper. Incidences of cheating will be reported to the Office of
Student Conduct, which may administer additional punishment. Cheating includes
plagiarism. What is most important is that everyone learns the proper methods
of crediting their sources so as to avoid inadvertent plagiarism. Plagiarism
includes appropriation of whole passages with or without credit, appropriation
of words and phrases without credit, appropriation of both main and supporting
ideas without credit, and paraphrasing without credit. Plagiarism also
includes submitting a paper written by someone else. If you are unsure of how
to properly cite sources, ask Professor Olney for guidance.

**_Course Assignments, Determination of Grades, and Due Dates_**  
There are two big assignments: a midterm and the term paper. But to develop
researching and writing skills capable of producing a quality research paper,
there are a number of other assignment due along the way.

For each assignment other than the midterm and the term paper, please put your
name, the date, **and the word count** in the upper right hand corner. Include
a brief centered title. Use an 11 or 12 pt font. Double space your text. For
example:

January 24, 2001  
Word Count: 60

Syllabus for Economics 190

Text starts here. Word count includes only the text, not the title nor the
headings at top right. Your

word processor has a way of counting the number of words in a block of text.
If you don't know

what that is, use the "help" command on your word processor and search for
help on "count" or

"word count."  
---  
  
**_Regarding the Assignments_**

**_Note: 250 words is approximately one double-spaced, 12 pt font, page with 1
inch margins on all sides._**

  
  

**Letter of Introduction** : A one-page paper in which you introduce yourself
to Prof. Olney. Handwritten is ok. E-mailed to Prof. Olney is ok. Typed and
turned in at class is preferred.

**Library Quiz** After the library seminar on February 7, you will receive a
quiz by email. Return it to Prof Olney by email before noon on February 14.

**250-350 words: THREE COPIES of Critical analysis.** You will read an article
of your choice in an economics journal, identify assumption(s) made by the
author(s), and critically analyze the argument(s). Your approach will be based
on the method discussed in class on January 31. _Attach the abstract,
introduction, and conclusion to one copy of the article. Bring the other two
copies with you to class for peer-editing._

**250-300 words maximum: Critical Analysis, REVISED**. Based on the editing
suggestions you receive on February 14, revise your essay. Attach to your
essay a list of **Five McCloskey rules that you applied to your essay.** For
each of five different "rules," apply the rule to a sentence/passage in your
February 14 version of your essay. The 250 word limit applies to your essay
only, not to the attachment. Type the McCloskey-Rules attachment up this way:

Original sentence: <the original sentence from the February 14 version>  
Revised sentence: <your February 21 revision here>  
Rule applied: <use the chapter headings of McCloskey to indicate what rule you
applied>

**250 words maximum. Topic idea**. Include a statement of the topic, why it
seems interesting, and what researchable questions you might ask. Prof Olney
will give you feedback on your topic idea.

**2 - 3 pages: Data analysis.** You will analyze a data set of your choice.
Briefly describe the data set (what is being measured, by whom). Using your
econometric and analytical skills, present some analysis of the data. Present
your results graphically or in a clear table, or both. Clearly explain the
empirical results you present. If you cannot locate a data set, you may use
one of the data set(s) that Prof. Olney places on the course website.

**Annotated bibliography.** Prepare a preliminary bibliography for your term
paper. Use the citation system given in Turabian. Include at least seven
different items. At least two must be academic journal articles. At least four
must be published after 1990. _Annotate your bibliography;_ that is, for each
item, include one sentence that briefly states what is in the source and a
second sentence that explains how the source will be useful.

**Data Description and Analysis**. Locate a data source relevant to your term
paper topic, describe the data source, and present one piece of preliminary
analysis. Indicate how your results are relevant to your term paper topic.

**MIDTERM EXAM**. The midterm exam will consist of three or four essay
questions addressing the readings. You should be able to write a coherent,
clear essay on each topic we have discussed in class, explaining what the
issues are, what evidence was presented by the author(s), what conclusion the
author(s) came to, and what is at least one critique of the author(s)
argument.

**750 words maximum: TEAM PAPER: Take a Stand: Pro.** Alone or in teams of two
or three, choose an issue, and "take a stand" _in favor_ of a policy designed
to address the problem. Your position can not be rhetorical. You must defend
your position with economic analysis and data. Make your assumptions clear.
Present the strongest case possible but do not, even once, resort to
rhetorical excess. Don't demonize your opponents. That's especially important
because of the next assignment.

**750 words maximum: TEAM PAPER: Take a Stand: Con.** Alone or with the same
team of two or three, now "take a stand" _against_ the same policy you
addressed in the "Take a Stand: Pro" assignment. Your position can not be
rhetorical. You must defend your position with economic analysis and data.
Make your assumptions clear. Present the strongest case possible but do not,
even once, resort to rhetorical excess. Don't demonize your opponents: that
was you in the other paper.

**Team evaluations** : Write a _confidential_ evaluation of each person's
contribution to the two "take a stand" papers. Evaluate yourself, too. Should
the course grades on the two papers be awarded equally to all team members, or
does one person deserve a little more (or less) credit than the other(s)?

**PRESENTATION of "Take a Stand" Papers.** Each team will present their "Take
a Stand" papers, explain the issue addressed, the conceptual points on both
sides of the issue, and explain what research they think is needed to try to
resolve the debate. Each presentation should be about 10 minutes long.

**8 to 10 pages** : **Draft of 50 to 75 percent of your term paper.** The more
you can turn in, the more useful my comments.

**PRESENTATIONS**. In class, you will offer a 5 to 10 minute presentation of
your term paper topic. What is your topic? Why is it interesting? What
analysis did you conduct? What is your bottom line?

**12 to 15 pages: Term Paper!** What you've been building toward all quarter.
A term paper, on issues of discrimination and difference, race, gender, sexual
orientation, nativity, or the like. An economic problem or puzzle, an analysis
of the problem, an analysis of a policy proposal, and a conclusion soundly
advocating a course of action. Make it something you can include in your grad
school applications or recruitment packets.

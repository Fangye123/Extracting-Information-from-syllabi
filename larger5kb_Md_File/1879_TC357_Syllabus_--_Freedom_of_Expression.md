**  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
  This course is part philosophy, part legal studies, and part history. The
goal is to explore the role of freedom of expression in a democracy,which
requires understanding, and sometimes challenging, the assumptionsbehindour
common notions about freedom of expression. The course will beginwithbasic
questions about what the terms "freedom" and "expression" meanbeforesurveying
various theoretical approaches to freedom of expression.Among thetopics
covered will be English writings, early articulations
ofliberal/libertariantheory in the United States, contemporary articulationsof
the now-dominantliberal view, and the critical challenges that have emergedin
the past twodecades from feminist theory, critical race theory, and
criticallegal studies.  
  The course will address how these theories have found their way into law,
and students will read and discuss important Supreme Court cases aspart of
their research. But the course will be theory-driven, not case-driven. The
goal is not to survey the law of the First Amendment in the way a law school
course would, but rather to investigate broader philosophical issues
concerning freedom of expression.  
  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
**   Your grade in the course will be based on your participationin classand
written work, using the following formula:  
\--case brief (one page) 5 percent  
\--literature/case review (at least 6 pages): 20 percent  
\--final research paper (about 15 pages): 50 percent  
\--presentation of final paper in class: 5 percent  
\--participation in seminar discussion: 20 percent  
  
  Each student will complete a major research project. By the end of the
second week of class you will decide on a general topic. By the end of the
fourth week, you will turn in a specific proposal for the paper. In the sixth
week, you will turn in a one-page written brief of a case relevantto your
topic. The next step is a literature/case review that examines relevant
scholarly work and court cases. The format for these will vary dependingon
your topic. After that, you will write a final research paper. Write inany
style you choose (legal, Chicago, APA, etc.) but be consistent. Finally,you
will make a short presentation on your research to the class.  
  
  At the end of the semester I will judge your contribution to discussion in
the seminar. This portion of your grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity
with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand what others say; (c) ability
to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others
to form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to
disagreeconstructively; (f) cooperation in building a stimulating and
supportiveintellectual atmosphere in class; and (g) attendance.

This course is a survey of Japanese history from prehistory to the beginning
of the seventeenth century. The goal is to introduce students to the major
themes of premodern Japanese history. We will be especially concerned with the
relationship between Japanese culture and continental civilization, the
transformation of its social structure over time, the relationship between
civil and military authority in Japan, and the relationship between Japan's
intellectual, political, and social histories.

This is a survey course that makes use of various methods to help you acquire
knowledge of early Japanese history. In addition to lectures, there are
periodic discussions of assigned readings and films. Because I believe firmly
that writing sharpens our thinking and ability to analyze complex phenomena,
there is also a required research paper. Periodic quizzes will also help you
gauge your mastery of the material.  
**Grading policies:**  
Please note the following policies:  

    1. Letter grades are assigned according to the following scale: A=93-100, A-=90-92, B+=87-89, B=83-86, B-=80-82, C+=77-79, C=73-76, C-=70-72, D+=67-69, D=63-66, D-=60-62, E=less than 60. Please note that work never turned in counts as a zero (0).  

    2. Late papers lose one grade step for each day late (thus a B+ that is two days late receives a B-).  

    3. I do not give make-up quizzes or examinations unless you have an acceptable and documented excuse (for example, a medical excuse signed by a physician).  

    4. I will not consider requests for incompletes without a clearly documented and acceptable reason.  

    5. Plagiarism is using or purchasing the words or ideas of another and passing them off as one's own work. If a student quotes someone in a formal paper, that student must use quotation marks and give a citation. Paraphrased or borrowed ideas are to be identified by proper citations. Plagiarism will result, at the minimum, in a zero (0) for the assignment.

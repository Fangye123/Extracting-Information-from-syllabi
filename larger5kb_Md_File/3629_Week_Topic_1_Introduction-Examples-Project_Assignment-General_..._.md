**This class is taught in two sections, but shall have  
nearly identical homework, quizzes, examinations, and grading.**  

  
**Students not meeting the prerequisite and co-requisite requirements will  
be automatically dropped from the course.**  

**Required Texts:**  

1\.     E. L. Cussler, ``Diffusion'', 2nd edition, Cambridge University Press,
1996.

**Additional References:**

1\.     R. B. Bird, W. E. Stewart, and E. N. Lightfoot, Transport Phenomena
(chapters 16, 17, 18, 19, 21). 2\.     Perry and Green, Perry's Chemical
Engineering Handbook, McGraw Hill.

  

**Objectives**

The major objective of this course is to provide an introduction to the
fundamentals of multicomponent and multiphase transport and reaction phenomena
of essential importance to chemical engineers. The student should develop the
ability to apply the multicomponent equations of change to physical problems
in separation and reaction processes. The major emphasis of the course will be
on fundamentals and on applications to separation processes. The separation
processes of most interest will include distillation, extraction, and
absorption.

  

**Grading**

1\.     Four exams (three in-terms and one final, drop one) 60% (There will be
no make-up exams.) 2\.     Quizzes 30% (Drop 2 out of approx 9; No make-up
quizzes.)

3\.     Project Assignments 10%

There will be three examinations during the course and homework will be
assigned. Class discussion will be a very important part of the course.
Readings from the literature and handouts will be assigned periodically.
Students will be required to carefully study this material and attend class
prepared for discussions. If a student has questions concerning the grading of
exams and homework, the exam or homework may be resubmitted for (complete)
regrading up to one week following the return of the work to the student.
After this time, no material will be reviewed.

**Policy for Classwork, Homework, and Tests**

**Office Hours**

Assistance will gladly be given to students working hard to learn. Office
hours are to be strictly followed, however, students may make appointments for
times outside of office hours if necessary.

**Classwork**

Classes begin promptly at the stated time. Students who are chronically late
will not be admitted to class. Students late for exams because of
oversleeping, traffic problems, etc. will not be given additional time.

Students are expected to maintain their own notes. Classroom discussions may
not necessarily lead to organized notes from the transcribing of material from
the blackboard. Students should organize the material based on classroom
discussions and reading assignments.

Students are expected to be prepared for class and to participate in classroom
discussions.

**Honor Code** The honor code applies to all work assigned for this class.
Unless otherwise specified, all work is to be performed without assistance
from others.

**Homework**

Homework is a crucial part of an engineering education . One does not learn to
solve problems and perform calculations accurately by reading or attending
lectures. In addition, habits formed in thinking about problems and in
organizing the material for solving a problem are invaluable for future work
as an engineer. Engineering requires the discipline, thoroughness and
attention to detail necessary to solve complex problems. Students must take
the homework seriously.

**Other Considerations**

1\.     Some homework problems may require computer calculations such as
finding roots of non-linear equations and integrating ordinary differential
equations. It is expected that the student is familiar with such root finding
techniques as Newton's method and with numerical integration. 2\.     Some
homework may require additional data that is not given in the problem
statement. The student is expected to be able to find such data in standard
references such as Perry's Handbook, CRC Handbook, and the Merck Index. These
references are available at the various university libraries.

3\.     Some homework may have data in the problem statement that is not
necessary for solving the problem. The student should be able to discern what
data is relevant and what data is unnecessary.

4\.     Mathematics is an important tool for chemical engineers. Three
semesters of calculus and one semester of engineering mathematics are
prerequisites for this class. The student should be able to review this
material from previous courses. Integration by parts, partial fractions,
integrating factors, and trigonometric substitutions, solutions to
differential equations by Laplace transforms and separation of variables as
other methods should be familiar to the student.

**Tests**

1\.     Tests and examinations will be closed book. For tests and
examinations, two sheets of notes will be allowed for reference. For quizzes,
no notes are allowed. 2\.     Work must be performed in blue or black ink.

3\.     Answers must be boxed.

4\.     Errors in calculation should be crossed out with a single line, not
erased or scratched out.

5\.     Quizzes (20 minutes, closed book) will be given approximately every
week. Quizzes will cover assigned homework problems and/or material covered in
class. **BE PREPARED**.

**Computer Use** Students are encouraged to make use of the College computing
facilities. Some homework may require computation. Tools such as MATLAB,
MATHCAD, FORTRAN, C, PASCAL, are all acceptable.

At Reed, history is treated as a basic component of general education. The
department attempts to include in its course offerings as many periods and
areas of study as student enrollment and available faculty make possible. The
priority, however, is on diversity of approach&emdash;constitutional,
intellectual, economic, social, diplomatic, cultural&emdash;rather than on
specific coverage of conventional fields. The aim is to arouse sufficient
interest in history to stimulate a student's independent inquiry and the
necessary analytical thought and perspectives that go with historical study.

The department tries to inculcate students with a sense of history&emdash;to
impress them with the legacy, conscious or unconscious, that each present has
inherited from its past, as well as the many perspectives one can have on that
legacy. While many graduates have become prominent as professional historians
and teachers of history, it is even more as a fundamental contribution to
liberal, humanistic education and the development of a critical intelligence,
carried through in many different professions and ways of life, that the
department program is conceived and directed to majors and non-majors alike.

The junior qualifying examination in history is a critical essay dealing with
a given issue or problem within a particular historical field and period. The
department expects students to develop some competence in various periods and
areas of history, as specified in the course requirements below. The
department administers the junior qualifying examination only in November and
April of each academic year. Exceptions are made only for students returning
from leave away from campus, or for other circumstances beyond the student's
control. The department encourages but does not require its students to pursue
the study of a foreign language.

For students who wish to combine American history, literature, economics, and
government, Reed offers an American studies major. Among other possible
programs are interdisciplinary majors involving history, such as history-
literature and international studies.

**365 Consumer Cultures in Historical Perspective**

Historians' debates about when identifiable consumer cultures emerged will be explored, with emphasis on how these debates illuminate our understanding of the development of Western capitalism. We will consider changes in production as well as consumption, and how such developments altered peoples' understandings of self, class, and community.

     Full course for one semester. A survey of the contexts of origin, the development, and the social effects of technology in America from the early nineteenth century to the present.

Defenses and critiques of technology will be analyzed. Because of the breadth of the topic, the course will present alternative ways to address the history of technology rather than attempt a comprehensive narrative. Prerequisite: sophomore standing.

Attention is also paid to the postclassic Maya. Topics include forms of association (ayllu, calpulli, and city) and affinity (tribe and ethnicity), the organization of material exchange, and religious practice and belief in the pre-Hispanic world.

     Full course for one semester.

The focus will be on the creation of national identities; on the relationship between race, class, and active citizenship; and on the role of republican elites and ideology in the organization of national economies and their integration into world markets. Particular attention will be given to the ideologies of creole republicanism and positivism; to the relationship of provinces to central government and "national" elites, and especially the articulation of alternate conceptions of nationality following defeat in the War of the Pacific; to the late nineteenth-century expansion of the hacienda economy and Indian resistance; to the role of the military in national government; and to the troubled institutionalization of democratic republicanism in the last half-century. The course focuses on Peru but includes Bolivia and Ecuador. Prerequisite: sophomore standing. Conference.

**411: Junior Seminar: Families and Marriage in the U.S.**

     Full course for one semester. The course is arranged chronologically, but the point of the course is not to provide a comprehensive view of U.S. family history. Rather, students will read selected texts that raise interesting methodological questions, employ particular secondary and primary sources, and/or raise theoretical issues about how to do history. Topics include demographic reconstructions of colonial households; relations between and within black and white families in the slave-holding South; the respective legal effects of slavery, emancipation, and Reconstruction on African American families; how family structures of eastern European immigrants helped them to both accommodate and resist acculturation in the late nineteenth century; and political stereotypes and historical facts about families on the home front during World War II and the cold war of the 1950s. Prerequisite: junior standing in history (or junior standing in American studies with a history concentration) and two units in history. Conference.

**412 Junior Seminar: The Making of the Atlantic World: Europe and the
Americas, 1500 &endash;1800**

    Full course for one semester. This seminar offers students an opportunity to explore the history of the Atlantic nations and states in Europe and the Americas from the earliest periods of contact, conquest, and colonial settlement to the growth of settled commercial networks and systems of communication, the establishment of formal and informal imperial regimes, and the emergence by the eighteenth century of new countries with their own regional and cultural identities. Topics discussed will include the impulses behind early European voyages of discovery and the history of those first voyages, the patterns of European settlement and relations with indigenous peoples in North and South America, the growth of slavery as a system in the colonies and resistance to it, the development of new patterns of consumption and enterprise, and most especially the effects of contact with the Americas on the economic, social, political, and cultural life of Europe in the early modern period. The readings and discussions will introduce students to problems of theory and method, illustrated in part through a variety of case studies. While the seminar will look broadly at all European countries engaged in Atlantic exploration and enterprise, including the Spanish, the Portuguese, the French, and the Dutch, as well as the British, and at Latin America and the Caribbean as well as continental North America, special attention will be given to the experience of the British in the formative years of the British Empire and to the developments leading to the American Revolution. The main written work will be a substantial research paper on an independently formulated topic related to the main themes of the seminar, based on primary as well as secondary sources. Conference.

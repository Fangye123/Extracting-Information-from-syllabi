Berkin, Miller, Cherny, Gormly, Mainwaring, _Making America A History of the
United States_ , Brief Edition vol. B since 1865, Boston: Houghton Mifflin
Company, 1997.**

This brief, manageable introduction to U.S. History presents history as a
dynamic and unpredictable process, rather than an inevitable series of events.
Making America provides a structure for analyzing historical events, which
reflects on the Expectations, Constraints, Choices, and Outcomes of the event
and its actors. "Individual Choices" boxes spotlight an individual in history
and explain how that person's choices influenced historical events. Thought-
provoking "Voices" boxes present debates on historical events in the words of
key opposing players.

Course Objectives

**_

This is an introductory course in United States History from the 1863 into the
1990s. More about specific content will be discussed during the first several
days of class.

**

GRADING:**  
Grading in this course will be based on six quizzes, two essay exams, and a
critical thinking essay.  
**7 Quizzes, 5 graded-20%**  
A quiz will be given at the beginning of class on each of the days specified
below. It will be in a short answer format and will cover the assigned
document reading. Your highest 5 scores will be averaged as part of the
semester grade.  
**2 Essay Exams-60%** A place to help you: ["The Writing of a History
Examination"](http://www.coun.uvic.ca/learn/program/hndouts/histexam.html)  
The essay assignments will call for you to state an opinion on an issue or
issues relating to material covered in class and to support it with factual
evidence taken from class notes and assigned readings. Review questions will
be distributed prior to each exam. All exams will be taken using a black or
blue permanent ink pen and a Blue Book, which you must bring with you on the
days indicated.  
**Critical Thinking Essay-20%** Another place for help: ["How to Write the
Perfect History Essay"](http://www.bendigo.net.au/~douglass/history.html)  
The Critical Thinking essay will be a 2000(+or-) word essay on an assigned
topic. A handout describing the assignment will be given in class and posted
on the web at the appropriate time.

Mr. Peterson will use the following grading system. There will be no
exceptions or substitutions to it. Your oral and written work will be assigned
a letter grade. The respective values for each letter grade are indicated
below.

_

Letter System:_  

A = 4.0 |

A- = 3.7 |

  
---|---|---  
  
B+ = 3.4 |

B = 3.0 |

B- = 2.7  
  
C+ = 2.4 |

C = 2.0 |

C- = 1.7  
  
D+ = 1.4 |

D = 1.0 |

D- = 0.7  
  
F = 0.3 |

  |

  
  
If you have any questions and/or concern about your classroom performances
and/or earned grades, please make an appointment to confer with Mr. Peterson
as soon as possible. This course requires more than a casual effort and deals
with historical and cultural events, terminology, ideologies, and the ability
to communicate your understanding effectively in both written and oral
discourse. I will use the following criteria in evaluating your work during
this course.

A = Exceptionally well prepared and executed completion of assigned work
indicating effort, individualized style, and demonstrating a thorough grasp of
large portions of the course material.  
B = Creative, well-prepared work, demonstrating unusual effort, talent, or
grasp of the material that is distinctly superior to an "average" or "C"
effort.  
C = Satisfactory completion of assigned work at a level of effort and
competency normally expected of the majority of students (basic completion,
average performance, and reasonable effort).  
D = Unsatisfactory completion of work indicating misperceived objectives or
failure to grasp key concepts but with reasonable effort.  
F = Failure to complete assignments through a lack of reasonable effort, or
failure to attain passing average on either exams or assignments.

**

MAKE-UPS:**  
No make-ups for quizzes will be given. Any missed quizzes will be considered
as low scores and included in the grades dropped from consideration in
determining the final course grade. (Individual exceptions can be made in
cases of prolonged illness or absences due to university-sanctioned
activities. Verification of specific circumstances must be provided when
asking for special consideration.) There will be 2 scheduled make-up days for
the essay exams. They are noted in the attached schedule and will be the only
opportunities provided to make-up the exams.

**

LATE WORK POLICY:**  
All written work must be turned in on the date it is due whether you are
absent or not. Student's grade will be lowered one grade per class period late
on any written assignment. All written work must be typed, double-spaced with
1" margins, and adhere to the principles of college writing. For more help:
["Good Writing or Pet Peeves and Higher
Grades"](http://www.mc.maricopa.edu/users/peterson_b/class/Syllabus/WRTHABIT.html)

**

ATTENDANCE:**  
Roll will be kept daily, and a penalty will be assessed for non-attendance.
You will be allowed 3 absences without grade penalty. For every absence
thereafter, your final course grade will be lowered one grade point.
(Individual exceptions can be made in cases of prolonged illness or absences
due to university-sanctioned activities. Verification of specific
circumstances must be provided when asking for special consideration.)

**

FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES**  
If you have a physical or other disability that interferes with access to the
classroom, use of classroom facilities, or the completion of assignments as
specified, please contact Disability Resources for Students to make special
arrangements.

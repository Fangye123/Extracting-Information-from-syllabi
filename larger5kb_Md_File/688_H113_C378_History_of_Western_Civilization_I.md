Course description**

The course provides a survey of (what is commonly known as) Western
civilization from Antiquity to approximately 1600. It will focus in particular
on (a) the development of the key institutions of political and social life,
and (b) the ideas, values and attitudes that supported, and evolved with,
these institutions.

The course will emphasize the complexity of the history of the West by
focusing on problems of continuity and discontinuity within the western
tradition, and on the frequent interaction with (so-called) non-western
cultures.

**

Goals

**

The course has three goals:

(1) to provide basic knowledge of the course of European history (including
major events and personalities) until the end of the sixteenth century;

(2) to enhance the students' historical perspective on, and understanding of,
important political, social, and cultural themes in the societies studied (and
thus develop skills which are applicable, in principle, in the study of any
given society); and

(3) to give elementary training in the historian's craft through the critical
reading and interpretation of primary sources.

Requirements

**

1\. In accordance with school expectations, attendance at all class meetings
is a regular part of the course. It is your responsibility to sign the
attendance rosters. More than three absences will be penalized and seriously
affect your final grade. I may depart from this policy under exceptional
circumstances (such as prolonged illness or personal catastrophe); in that
case, it is essential that you promply inform me of the problem and provide
documentation. Classes will begin at 11:00 a.m. sharp; to avoid disruption be
sure to be on time.

2\. Classes will feature lectures, discussions, or a combination of these. It
is expected that you read the discussion materials (Homer/Wiesner sourcebook)
in advance; bring these materials to class on scheduled dates. Informed
participation will be part of your grade.

3\. This course covers thousands of years of human history, and discusses
difficult themes that will be unfamiliar to many of you. Therefore, you are
strongly advised to keep up with your textbook readings. It will make it
easier both to participate in the classes and to prepare for the exams.

4\. **Assignments**. Students must write two short papers, take two
examinations, and do a minimum of three pop-quizzes. The paper and exam
schedule is as follows (quizzes are **not** previously announced):

> > First paper due 2/7  
>  Midterm exam 2/28  
>  Second paper due 4/11  
>  Final exam 5/2

Make-up essays/exams will be scheduled only with a doctor's excuse (there is
no make-up option for quizzes).

The _papers_ will be on assigned sourcebook readings; they will be 4 pages
long (letter size, typed, double-spaced). Further details will be given in
class.

The _exams_ will consist of identifications and essay questions. The
identifications (of terms and names) will be taken from the reading and
lecture materials. The essay questions will require you to develop a short
historical argument on the basis of reading, lecture, and discussion
materials. To facilitate your preparation of the exams, study-guides will give
you a list of possible identifications and essay questions. These study-guides
will be provided at least a week before each exam.

In the course of the semester, there will be five _quizzes_ with elementary
questions about the sourcebook readings. You need to do a minimum of three of
these quizzes. If you take more, the three highest grades will count towards
your final grade.

Plagiarism, cheating on exams, and other forms of intellectual dishonesty will
not be tolerated. They will be dealt with in accordance with general
university policy. If you are unsure what constitutes plagiarism, ask, or
consult the _Indiana University Bulletin, School of Liberal Arts, Indianapolis
Campus, 2000-2002_ , p. 36.

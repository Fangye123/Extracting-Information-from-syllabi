**Course Description:** The Issues in Music course content is delivered
through a series of 12 one hour televised programs, which consist of musical
performances and commentary. Additionally, there are three two-hour class
sessions, which take place on campus with the course instructor.   Additional
contact between student and instructor is facilitated through regular office
hours (by telephone or in person). Content of the campus sessions range from
introductory materials, instruction (particularly as concerns Aaron Copland's
concepts of "What To Listen For In Music"), and to assessment.  
This course is designed to involve the student in the concert hall experience.
Performances by artist faculty consist of significant works of classical, jazz
and the music of other cultures. Analysis and discussion of these works
accompany performances. Everything is designed to involve the student in a
discussion centered around the question, "What is today's music?" No
prerequisites.

**Important:** Please do not write your notes on the packet of materials. You
need to retain the materials in order to study for your exams.  Instead, write
your notes on plain paper and make a photocopy of your notes before you turn
them in.

**Obtaining your Grade:**   Sorry, absolutely **no** grades are given over the
phone or email.  Grades are posted in the Westside Student Center usually 1-2
weeks after the exams are taken.  If you wish to have your grade mailed to
you, please provide the Telecourse office with a self-addressed stamped
envelope, and your grade will be mailed to you as soon as it is posted.  Our
address is: Telecourse Office, c/o Christine Pollard, University of South
Florida, 5700 N. Tamiami Trail, PMA 218 Sarasota, FL.  34243.

**Make up exam requests:  ** Please mark your calendar immediately with exam
dates so that you know in advance when your exams are scheduled.  Upon receipt
of the syllabus, if you see a conflict it is your responsibility to inform Dr.
Baker as well as the Telecourse Office immediately of the conflict and to
submit a request for a make-up exam with supporting documentation in order for
your request to be considered.  All requests must be made PRIOR to the
scheduled exam. Make-up exams are essay in format so it is highly recommended
that you arrange to take your exam at the scheduled time indicated in the
syllabus. **You will need to provide documentation supporting the reasons for
missing exams. Finally, Dr. Lauren Baker must be notified by the student as to
why the exam was missed and when the makeup exam is scheduled.**

**Overnight Block Feed for Issues in Music:**

On Tuesday, 1/30 please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #1-5 as the
blockfeed will begin  at **** 12:00am on Wednesday, 1/29 . The programming
will continue until 5:00am.

On Monday, 3/20 please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #6-10 as the
blockfeed will begin  at 12:00am on Wednesday, 3/21.  **** The programming
will continue until 5:00am.

On Tuesday, 4/03 please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #11-12 as the
block feed will begin  at 2:00am on Wednesday, 4/04. **  ** The programming
will continue until 3:00am.  
  


**Attention Students:**

  
_We recommend that you tape the programs as they are being broadcast on WUSF-
TV channel 16 on a weekly basis._  
We do NOT recommend that you rely on the block feed/overnight broadcast as
your only means of seeing the videos  because:  
A)  Your VCR could malfunction  
B)  Your power could go off  
C)   You could forget to set your VCR  
D)  WUSF-TV could have broadcasting difficulties  
Also, it is **not** a valid excuse to request special consideration from the
instructor (ie: makeup exam, ) if there is a technical problem with the
overnight broadcast. Therefore, tape the programs off the air during the
weekly broadcasts, and then if you missed any of the programs, the overnight
broadcast/block feed will enable you to view the programs you missed.

**_For the 3 Credit Hour Course Only!):_**

If you are taking this course for 3 hours, in addition to the course
requirements listed above, you will be required to write an annotated
bibliography. Further discussion and explanation will follow at the first
review session.

**_Annotated Bibliography_**

**An annotated bibliography in which each source has been examined and the
author provides commentary on the source. The commentary usually comes in
paragraph or outline form directly under the citation. (See examples)

**Assignment**

**Create an annotated bibliography of 20 sources and annotate them. The list
of sources must include:

5 reference books or volumes  
5 periodicals  
5 On-Line (Internet) sources  
5 of your choice (biographies, bio-bibliographies, history books, additional
above sources, or anything else you might encounter).

**Parameters**

1\. The reference books and periodicals can be on any topic of music related
to our class. (Please no pop music sources, or anything else you might
encounter).

2\. The annotation (text) should contain these types of things:  
    A. The complete bibliographic citation in proper form.   
    B. A listing of what is contained in the source (a table of contents, index, what the   
         appendix  has in it, if it has a bibliography, a discography, etc...)   
    C. A brief discussion of the contents: how useful is it, how difficult/easy to use, how well it   
         covers the topic, it it is useful to the music lay person or is it more "advanced."   
    D. If it is a reference book, is it a general reference book such as an encyclopedia   
         covering all aspects of music, or is it a dictionary of only one thing such as jazz terms?   
    E. Does the on-line source have a search engine within it?   
    F.  If it's a periodical, do we carry all of the volumes in our library? How many if not?

3\. You may find it helpful to pick a composer and find sources related to
that person. For  
     example: _Mozart: A Life_ , by Maynard Solomon. Or you can use general sources such as   
     _The History of Western Music_ , By Donald J. Grout.

4\. You may annotate the source in paragraph or outline form. A complete
paragraph is  
     sufficient for length - you should be able to get at least three on a page (unless you really   
     have **lots** to say).

5\. If you can help it, please don't check the books out of the library, as
others may need to  
    use them as well.

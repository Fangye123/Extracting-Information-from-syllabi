**Course Description ** ****[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm)  
EMC300 is an introduction to the integration of computers with classroom
curriculum using:  word processing, databases, spreadsheets, teacher utility
programs, and educational software.  For Education majors only.  Prerequisite:
EMC 321 or equivalent.  
  
****Course Objectives**** ** **[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm)**  
** Because a teacher education endorsement should include hands-on experience
in the use of computers in educational settings, the following objectives are
designed to help future teachers feel competent and confident using
technology.  At the completion of the course, the students would be able to:  
  
  * Discuss the role of the computer,  the Internet and multimedia in schools and classrooms,
  * Discuss and apply criteria for evaluating software and hardware for use in classrooms,
  * Use the Internet to gather resources for educational purposes for use in classrooms,
  * Create and present a children's story in multimedia format,
  * Use electronic mail to communicate with others, ** **
  * **Learn to deal with personal frustration when computers, labs, printers, and manuals do NOT function as expected.**

  
  
**Required Texts and Materials**[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm) ** **  
  
  * EMC321 readings available on-line
  * [http://www.west.asu.edu/achristie/300/readings_300e.htm](http://www.west.asu.edu/achristie/300/readings_300e.htm)
  * At least two 3.5" **High Density** floppy disks.  Available at the ASU West Bookstore or computer stores throughout the valley.
  * Notebook for recording notes during demonstrations and exploration.
  * A three-ring binder with **cover pocket, dividers, and tabs**.

  
  
**Course Format **[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm)**  
** Students will participate in an action-oriented classroom, which will
feature illustrated lecture, discussion, demonstration, hands-on activities
and demonstrations, and project presentations.  The emphasis will be on
**doing** rather than **talking about** computers and their uses in education.

  Additional lab time beyond the scheduled course hours will be necessary to
fulfill the course requirements.  You may use the computers in Technopolis
(602-543-8278) to complete assignments for this class.  Hours for Technopolis
for Spring 2002:  

| Monday \- Thursday | 7:30 AM - 11:00 PM  
---|---  
Friday & Saturday | 7:30 AM -  7:00 PM  
Sunday | 11:00 AM - 10:00 PM  
  
Your assignments provide you with _minimum_ amount of hands-on time.   The
more you use and experiment with computers and software, the richer your
learning experience will be.

Assignments should be submitted electronically or in paper form at the
beginning of the class period.  All submitted papers should be consistent with
upper division university writing; that is, university level grammar, correct
spelling, and logical clear organization.  All assignments should be computer
generated.

**Evaluation**[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm)

  
EMC300 is a Pass-Fail course.  All work will be evaluated with a **check,** to
indicate satisfactory completion of the assignment, or a **See Me,** to
indicate that the assignment needs some revision.   Participation is
considered to be one of the most important aspects of your evaluation.  
  
**Class Policies**[![](arrow.gif)](syllabus_emc300.htm)

  
**Attendance and Participation:   **Since the class is highly participatory,
attendance and a high level of participation are mandatory.  Missing more than
two class periods results in an automatic failure. Please sign-in at the
beginning of class on the attendance sheet.

  
**Cheating:   **Cooperative or collaborative learning is encouraged!  However,
understand the fine line between collaboration and cheating.  Turning in the
work of another person is considered cheating and offenders are subject to
university disciplinary action.

  
**Disabilities:   **If you have a disability, please tell me at the beginning
of the semester.  I will do all I can to enhance your learning experience.

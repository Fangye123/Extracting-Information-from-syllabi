    * What do these arguments tell us about the rest of the world?
    * 

**Core Questions and Arguments of Course** :

  
  

  * How vicious is anarchy and how can it be tamed?
  
  

  * To what extent and why is world globalizing and/or fragmenting? With what effects?
  
  

  * Both threats and solutions/remedies seem to be multiplying or growing at ever faster rates. 
    * Solutions may be 'evolved towards' or catalyzed by disasters and big events.
    * Magnitude of solutions must, I think, match magnitude of problems.
  
  

  * So, we live in interesting times that may be characterized as a race of solutions against problems.
  
  

  * Reality is likely to be lumpy and weird, marked by fits and starts, progress and regression, disaster and relief. 
  
  

  * In weird and fast times, analytical skills are key.
    * You must be able to dissect and construct arguments.

**ENGLISH 641**. Topics in the Medieval Period.  
Section 001 - Representing Christianity, Judaism and Islam  
Instructor(s): Theresa L Tinkle (tinkle@umich.edu)  
Prerequisites  & Distribution: (Excl).  
Credits:  
Course Homepage: No homepage submitted.  
Anti-Judaic and anti-Islamic polemics accompany the preaching of the First
Crusade in 1096, and violent action against Jews and Moslems follows the
violent words. Narratives of violence and dangerous images of Jews and Moslems
become naturalized in the centuries leading up to the Reformation \- indeed,
such representations become central to the formation of national and religious
identity. This course will investigate diverse representations of Judaism and
Islam in this period and inquire into the cultural work they accomplish.
Primary texts will likely include literature of the Crusades (sermons,
romances, monastic polemics), travel literature (Mandeville's Travels),
selections from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (probably the Prioress's Tale),
drama (the plays of the Digby manuscript - The Conversion of Saint Paul and
Mary Magdalene - and the Croxton Play of the Sacrament). We will conclude by
examining Martin Luther's contributions to polemical traditions. As we proceed
through these texts, we will focus particularly on narratives of contact and
conversion, and on dominant myths and stereotypes. Secondary texts will
include recent historicist scholarship, including work by Rubin, Funkenstein,
Signer, Greenblatt, Cohen, Fradenburg, Patterson, and Metlitzki. Many of the
primary texts on this syllabus invite consideration of manuscript and print
incarnations: How, for instance, was the Prioress's antisemitism received in
the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries? To explore these issues, we will spend
some time with manuscript and print versions in the Rare Book Room. Written
assignments will include common academic tasks: a book review; a short
analysis of a manuscript or pint version of a text; a description, syllabus
and teaching statement for an undergraduate course; and an annotated
bibliography and grant application for projected research in the field.

Persian has been called the French of the Near/Middle East. Certainly,
Persia/Iran has been in the news. Persian is an Indo-European language,
related to English, etc. Its literature, like other arts, is a major part of
Near/Middle Eastern and Muslim tradition. Persian 141 is the first term of a
four-term sequence. It takes the student through to the basic mastery of the
skills of reading and writing, and of comprehension and speaking. Cultural as
well as communicative skills are emphasized. By the end of the term the
student should be well versed in these skills. Individual students work with
the instructor to polish and improve the student's Persian language skills.
The objective is language use. Students who have special needs, such as those
acquiring the knowledge of Persian for reading purposes, only, or for
communicative skills, only, will be given special attention and special
sessions. Similarly, students of Iranian heritage, who may know some Persian
in its colloquial form, will find the linguistic and cultural content of this

This is the first course in a two-course introductory sequence (442 and 443)
that covers Near Eastern history from the era of Muhammad to the present. Our
purpose is to introduce you to (and give you some practice in) methods of
studying the Near East as well as to some of the content of Near Eastern
history; we expect no previous background in the field.  
This course begins with the background and rise of Islam and ends in the
heyday of the Ottoman Turkish and Safavid Persian empires, circa 1700\.
Although the basic organization of the course is chronological, we will
discuss topics in such areas as politics and governance, religion (formal and
"folk," including theology and mysticism), law, foreign relations and war, art
and architecture, literature, economics, and social life. The classes will
include lectures by (and probably discussions between) the instructors, and
there will also be weekly class discussion of the assigned readings. In
addition to the final examination, students will be expected to prepare two
three-page exercises based on the readings, which will consist of modern
scholarly works and translated medieval sources.

Christian and ascetic influences, this course will explore the central themes
and institutional forms of Sufism, a stream of Islam which stresses the
esoteric (mystical) dimensions of religious faith. It will reflect upon the
inward quest and devotions of Muslim mystics as these have been lived and
expressed in art, theology, literature, and fellowship since the 8th century
CE. Concepts of the self, divine love, self-perfection, the mystical path with
its states and stages, and mystical knowledge will be introduced through a
study of key philosophical and didactical treatises of Sufism as well as
specimens from its rich tradition of ecstatic mystical poetry. Course
requirements include two short papers, a class presentation, and a term paper.

male subjectivities "of" the Middle East are constructed, represented, and
deployed in a variety of literary and cultural forms, including the novel,
short story, travel accounts, and visual images in film, photography, and
painting. Topics we will explore include the veiling of women, genderized and
sexualized aspects of the relationship portrayed and enacted between colonizer
and colonized in the Middle Eastern context, images of women in nationalist
discourse, constructions of masculinity and "manliness," challenges to and
subversions of traditionally inscribed gender roles, etc. Close attention will
be paid to differences between such representations which emerge as a result
of who authors or creates them, and from what kind of gendered subject
position - European/western men, European/western women, Middle Eastern men,
Middle Eastern women.

This course will present both factual and interpretive material about the
Arab- Israeli conflict, an international dispute that has lasted for almost a
century and whose significance extends far beyond the Middle East. After
providing background information about Israel and the Arab world, including
the Arabs of Palestine, the course will trace the historical development of
the conflict from its origins in the 19th century until the present. The
course will also examine the most important issues associated with the
conflict, giving special attention to the competing territorial claims
advanced by Israelis and Palestinians and to the rights of self-determination
asserted by each. Attention will be given as well to relations between Israel
and the Arab states. In discussing the many controversial issues associated
with the Arab-Israeli conflict, the course will strive for objectivity and
balance and will encourage the evaluation of differing points of view,
including not only the competing views of Israelis and Arabs but also the
important differences existing within Israel and the Arab world. The
instructor for the course has attended university and subsequently conducted
research in both the Arab world and Israel, having spent over four years in
the former and almost three years in the latter. He visits the area frequently
and regularly collaborates with Israeli and Arab scholars.

This course serves two main functions: the first of these is to provide an
introductory sense of what is involved in the academic study of religion; the
second, which will occupy almost the whole term, is to introduce the major
religious traditions of the Near East, with emphasis on the development and
major structures of Israelite Religion, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The
course will keep two foci in view: one will have to do with the historical
development of these religious traditions, their sacred texts and major
personalities; the second will involve a comparative view of these traditions
by analyzing their sense of the sacred in space, time, and text, their views
on holy people. This is an introductory course: it is not necessary for
students to have any previous experience in the study of religion. The course
consists of three weekly lectures and a discussion group. Writing for the
course typically involves an essay, a midterm, and a final exam.

This course surveys Islamic art and architecture from Spain to India and from
the advent of Islam in the 7th century to the rise of Colonialism. What were
the processes through which this new venture gave shape to particular Islamic
idioms? Architecture (mosques, mausoleums, palaces, garden ensembles and urban
environments), the luxury objects of utility (ceramics, metalwork, glass,
textiles, etc.), painting and the arts of the book will be explored as
manifestations and visual representations of the production of Islam,
enunciating its spiritual and intellectual values, and the socioeconomic
parameters that contributed to the formation and development of its
distinctive cultural system. Special attention will be given to the
interaction between the new faith and pre-Islamic traditions of the conquered
through the dynamic interplay between indigenous and Qur'anic cultures. The
problematics in interpreting vastly diverse cultural systems as an unchanging,
monolithic phenomenon will be emphasized.  
Interactive class discussions relating the visual with the discursive, a mid-
term, a final exam, small written assignments on museum objects, and museum
visits are required.

This course takes the palace as the locus of spatial and visual enunciations
of Muslim kingship. The palace and its representational plentitude - from
architecture and landscaping to ceremonials and their accoutrements, from
spectacle and spectatorship to gendered zones of access - will be analyzed as
carefully orchestrated manifestations of the cultural production of authority.
We shall trace the political, economic, social, and cultural particularities
of Muslim kingdoms and their distinctive rhetoric of sovereignty through
experiencing the palaces, their furnishings, and the luxury objects of utility
(including illustrated manuscripts, ceramics, metalwork, textiles, etc.).
Special attention will be given to the ways in which Qur'anic culture merges
with pre-Islamic Persian and Byzantine traditions of kingship. Our goal is to
gain a nuanced understanding of the iconography of kingship in the Islamic
world through close and critical considerations of the visual and the
literary. Interactive class discussions relating the visual with the
discursive, small written assignments leading to a final paper, a final exam,
and museum visits are required.

This seminar course introduces significant bibliographical resources in print
and electronic format for the study of the Middle East. The course covers the
bibliographical organization of the disciplines of history, language and
literature, politics, economics, and sociology, religion and philosophy, and
art and archaeology within the context of Middle Eastern area studies. The
students discuss, evaluate, and use the bibliographical tools introduced in
the course. Many students lack knowledge of the bibliographical resources in
the disciplines and are inadequately prepared in the use of them. An
introduction to these resources, accompanied by assigned work in the use of
the material helps students overcome the difficulties in locating and
organizing research materials.

Culture and Politics in the Contemporary Middle East  
Prof. Marcia Inhorn  
Fall 2002  
This graduate seminar is designed to introduce CMENAS students to some of the
most important contemporary cultural and political issues shaping life in the
Middle East, North Africa, and diasporic Middle Eastern communities in the
West. A major goal of the course is to acquaint students to the research of
CMENAS core faculty, including some who will give guest lectures. The course
will be organized around four core themes-Islam, Politics, Nationalism and
Modernity, Gender and Family Life-with movement from the macropolitical level
of Islamic discourse and regional politics to the most intimate politics of
everyday family life in the contemporary Middle East. Through reading,
thinking, talking, and writing about a series of book-length monographs-most
of them written by CMENAS faculty-students in this course will gain broad
exposure to a number of exigent issues in the Middle Eastern region, as well
as to the methodologies and theories of social scientists, historians, and
area studies specialists. Students will be graded on seminar participation,
leadership of one seminar discussion, and a comparative written review of
three additional books. Texts to be covered in the course include:  
Overview  
Dale Eickelman, The Middle East and Central Asia: An Anthropological Approach  
Islam

This is the third-year course within the Hebrew language sequence at the
University of Michigan. As such, it constitutes a transitional stage from the
lower levels - in which the concern is with learning introductory grammar and
acquisition of functional vocabulary - to the more advanced levels in which we
will focus on the more complex linguistic structures. At this level we will
treat original texts which will serve as the jumping-off point for in-class
discussion and the basis for composition of essays at home. The goal is to
expose the student to a wide range of texts as a window unto "the Israeli
Experience." The course will incorporate other communications media, e.g.,
material recorded on audio tape, video clips, and multi-media.

The social genre of the communications media (newspaper and television) serves
as the basis for discussion of current events, readings, and writing tasks.
Unedited newspaper selections and television news broadcasts provide the basis
for classroom activities. Special projects, in the form of debates and
individual presentations, constitute an important part of the course
activities, and are designed to enhance speech and communication. The final
grade is based on class activities, students' presentations, written
assignments, and two examinations: midterm and final. Class discussions and
activities are exclusively in Hebrew.

Hebrew 471 is an intensive introduction to Modern Hebrew literature. The
purpose of the course is to read carefully a wide range of literary texts of
different periods and different genres. The course will help to develop a
theoretical framework in order to allow student to situate and respond
critically to this body of literature. So along with studying specific
strategies to articulate Israeli diversity of gender, religion, history and
nationhood, we will discuss relevant issues such as colonialism, hybridity,
orientalism and multiculturalism. The literary texts selected include Zionist
and postZionist writers, women, Sephardic/Mizrahi Jews, and Palestinians.  
An advanced knowledge of Hebrew required (completion of Hebrew 302 or Hebrew
402 or equivalent). Short essays, term paper or project. The course is open to
undergraduate and graduate students. Graduate Students have additional
assignments and are expected to write a longer and more

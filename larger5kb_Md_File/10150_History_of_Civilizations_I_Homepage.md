OBJECTIVES** : For most of human history, humans lived in small groups who
hunted and gathered their food, but around 8,000 BC, something changed. Humans
began to develop agriculture, form larger groups, build huge empires, create
institutional religion and explore their planet. Using historical texts, we
will try to determine how these changes took place as well as how historians
try to figure out what happened.

**

ATTENDANCE POLICY** : The University's attendance policy permits you to miss
up to 3 classes without penalty. Your final grade will drop by 1/3 grade for
each absence over 3 (i.e. 6 absences will reduce you grade by one whole
letter). If you miss an exam, you may make it up at the end of the semester
**ONLY** if you present a valid written excuse. The only acceptable documents
are medical excuses on appropriate stationary, police reports of incidents in
which you were personally involved, and funeral notices for immediate family
members. If you need to reschedule an exam because it conflicts with a
university-sanctioned event, you must present a letter to me in advance from
the faculty member or administrator responsible for the event.

**

NOTICE:** We at West Chester University comply with the Americans With
Disabilities Act of 1990 by making accommodations for persons with
disabilities. Please make your needs known by contacting the professor and/or
the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities at ext. 3217. Sufficient
notice is needed in order to make the accommodations possible.

**

GRADES** : There will be three exams. Each will provide one third of your
grade. Regular attendance and meaningful class participation will improve the
final grade in all borderline cases.

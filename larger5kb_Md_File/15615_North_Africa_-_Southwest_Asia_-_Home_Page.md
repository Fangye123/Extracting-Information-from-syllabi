**Objectives by Theme**

>  PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. What are the physical, cultural, economic, and/or historical criteria
(characteristics) used to define this _realm_ and the _regions_ within it? Why
are the boundaries drawn where they are?

>   2. Using maps found in the textbook's introduction (figures I-9, I-4, I-6,
I-7, and I-8), your atlas, and the appropriate textbook chapter, explain where
most people live in this realm and where few people live. Why do they live
there or not live there?  
>  [Previous Harper geography students have identified five criteria which may
explain where people live: 1) near fresh water, 2) flat terrain, 3) near
coasts, 4) temperate climate, and 5) fertile soil. Are these applicable to
this realm?]

>   3. Use the maps listed to answer the following questions:

>     1. a. Why do some call this realm the "dry realm"? (figures I-6, I-7).
How does the distribution of population in the realm make this title LESS
useful (figure I-9)?

>

> b. Why do some call this realm the "Arab world"? (Goodes Atlas p. 29-World
Languages) Why might this be an inappropriate title?

>

> c. Why do some call this realm the "Islamic World"? (figure 6-1, p. 276 What
are two reasons why this title might be inappropriate?

>

> d. Why do some call this realm the "Middle East"? The authors of the
textbook use the term "middle east" to refer to one REGION of this realm.
Which 5 countries make up the "middle east according to the authors? (figure
6-8, pp. 292-93)  
>

>

>

> CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. List and discuss the four primary centrifugal (devisive) forces within
the realm.

>   2. Understand the origins, the basic tenets, the "divisions", and the
spreading of Islam. (NOTE: Study all four parts of this objective.)

>   3.  Outline the historical events which led to the formation of the state
of Israel and the Arab-Israeli conflicts that followed. What is the current
state of the Arab-Israeli peace process? The Arab-Israeli conflict is well
reported in the world press. We all should understand its historical,
cultural, and geographical origins and its current status.

>   4. Who are the Kurds? Where do they live? Why have they been in the news
recently?

>

>

> ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Apply the measures of economic development to the realm.

>   2. Oil has had a large impact on the economies of many countries of the
realm. Identify the locations of the major oil reserves and discuss the
economic and cultural impact oil has had in these locations. (See figure 6-7,
pp. 288-98.)

>   3. Define NOMADISM and gain a basic understanding of this lifestyle and
economic activity.

>

>

> HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Discuss the two ancient culture hearths found in this realm. (figure
6-2)

>   2. Discuss the diffusion of Islam from its source on the Arabian peninsul
and begin to identify present-day consequences of this diffusion. (WHERE? WHY
THERE? WHY DO WE CARE?)

>   3. What and where was the Ottoman Empire? When did it collapse and what
are its historical consequences?

>

>

> REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Where might this large realm be divided into two sets of regions? Upon
what criteria might this division be based?

>   2. You should be able to apply the regional criteria to describe the
characteristics of each region of the realm and note differences between
adjacent realms.

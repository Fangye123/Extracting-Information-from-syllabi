**I. Nature of the Course**

This course will deal with the intellectual and cultural history of the
ancient world. There are many ways to configure such a course. I have chosen
to highlight the cultural contributions of the ancient Greeks (the dominant
Mediterranean culture) during the period from c. 750 B.C. down to c. 250 A.D.
Any such course must be rigorously selective in dealing with one of the most
creative periods in human history. We shall read a representative selection of
literary works drawn from different genres. While an aesthetic appreciation of
our readings will be important and their

lasting contribution to civilization cannot be slighted, we shall be careful
to understand each work in its appropriate political and social context.

**II. Grading and Requirements**

A. 30% Mid-term **(OCTOBER 23)**

30% Essay **(due DECEMBER 4)**

40% Final (comprehensive and cumulative, with an emphasis on the second half
of the course): **DECEMBER 15 (FRIDAY), 12:00 PM TO 3:00 PM**

B. The mid-term is an in-class exam, testing material to that date; the format
of the test, which will include short answers and essay, will be announced.

C. The essay is an analysis of a specific work by one of the authors whose
work we have read during the term. The student will choose his/her own subject
from a list of works that have not been assigned in the readings for the whole
class. A list of questions for analysis will be circulated. A topic is to be
chosen by **OCTOBER 25** and may be discussed in an individual meeting with
the instructor. The essay is due at the beginning of class on **DECEMBER 4** ,
and should be no less than 7 and no more than 12 double-spaced typed pages. A
handout with a format of the paper, and suggestions on how it should be
researched and written, will also be made available.

D. Be well advised that students are not only responsible for the passages of
the ancient authors that are assigned to be read before our meetings, but are
expected to be conversant and knowledgeable about the passages introduced in
class in illustration and explication of the works forming the material of the
course. Students who are unsure whether they can maintain regular attendance
(a record of which will be maintained) should reconsider whether this course
is appropriate.

E. In the assigned readings, observe that the instruction _cf._ (= _confer_ ),
which means "compare" has been used to mark places where passages are
partially repeated (in shorter form) in different required books for the
course. Sometimes, these selections cover more important poems. These
secondary readings may be used for review at your discretion.

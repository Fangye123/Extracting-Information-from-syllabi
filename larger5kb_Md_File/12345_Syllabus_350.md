**MODERN POLITICAL THOUGHT  
Political Science 350  
Fall, 1998  
Dr. Portis **



The most famous of the "modern" political theorists lived before the twentieth
century. Yet their arguments concerning obligation and legitimacy are
continually echoed in contemporary debate, and their conceptions of political
reality provide the assumptions underlying much contemporary analysis of
political affairs. In this course we will compare, contrast and evaluate the
most important of these views of political life, and discuss their relevance
to understanding political experience.

Eight books and pamphlets constitute the required reading for the course, all
of which should be available in the MSC Bookstore  ![](../../_themes/copy-of-

![](../../_themes/copy-of-pixel/apixbul1.gif)|  Hegel, G.W.F. _Introduction to

Although the required reading is constituted entirely of the above listed
primary sources, a list of secondary commentary and other recommended reading
for each theorist is provided for those students who wish to do explore
further. Additional suggestions for extra reading can be found at the end of
each relevant chapter in the Portis volume.

Each student will be required to write three essays. These essays must be from
five to ten typed, double spaced pages in length. The topic of each essay will
be announced one week before its due date. These are not research papers, and
should not require additional reading. There will be a final exam. In lieu of
the final exam, a student may, with the permission of the instructor,
substitute a 15-20 page research paper. Any student choosing this option must
have his or her topic approved by the instructor before Feb. 9. Each of these
four assignments will contribute equally in the calculation of the course
grade.

It is important that students attend class on a regular basis, and that they
do the assigned reading before they attend class. Although no specific grade
will be awarded for contribution to class discussions, the instructor reserves
the right to raise a student's course grade above what may have been obtained
on the written assignments on this basis.

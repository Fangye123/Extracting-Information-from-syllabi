Objectives
History 369 attempts to explore three related areas:

the origins and nature of Native American societies from their 
origins
  to the present;
  the interaction of Indian societies with respect to trade, 
conflicts,
  migrations, culture, and pan-Indian movements from prehistory to the 
present;
  the interaction of Indian societies with Europeans and the United 
States
  from the 15th century to the present.

General
Education Section F3: Comparative Cultural Studies
History 369 satisfies Section F3 for all but history majors. If you 
hold
junior status by the end of this semester, this course may satisfy 3 of
the 9 upper-division GE units required by CSUN. History 369 relates to 
the
goals of F3 Intra-National Cross-Cultural Studies by focusing on the 
essential
and distinctive features of Native American societies; by promoting 
appreciation
for and critical thinking about interactions among Native Americans and
other groups in an evolving American society with special attention to 
California;
and by exploring the changing role of Native American women and their 
relationship
with American women in general.

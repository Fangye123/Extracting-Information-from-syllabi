Congratulations on your selection as a Cole Scholar of the Oberlin Initiative
in Electoral Politics! Your obligations as a Cole Scholar in the Oberlin
Initiative in Electoral Politics include: 1) completing this semester course
(Polt 421) as required; 2) performing well in your internship this summer; and
3) completing a course next fall (Polt 422) that requires you to submit a
twenty page paper on some topic related to campaigns, elections and American
politics in which you situate your internship experience within some body of
theoretical literature. Additionally, we ask you to submit on disk your
bibliography (by topic) so we can post it on the web. In addition to commiting
yourself to completing successfully all aspects of this program, your
continued participation in the Cole Scholar program and the Oberlin Initiative
in Electoral Politics is conditional on your successful participation in each
stage of the program.

We expect that you will become part of a network of Oberlin students and
alumni working in American politics. We will try to provide you with
opportunities to meet and discuss issues with previous interns, alumni, and
experts in the field. We also expect you to allow us to call on you to
participate and help other students and alumni involved in the OIEP.



### Polt 421:

The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the scholarly literature on
elections and campaigns and also to provide you with some entry-level, basic
skills that you may need during your internship and in later campaigns when
you run for public office. We cannot provide you with all the skills that you
will need in just one course and you should realize that in this course you
receive academic college credit because it is an academic course. The Politics
Department does not award academic credit for internships or for non-academic
coursework. So the main focus of this course is to provide you with exposure
to the scholarly literature on campaigns, elections, and political party
activities. The faculty and staff of the Oberlin Initiative in Electoral
Politics (OIEP) hope that this course will provide you with a "larger view"
that will sustain you as you carry out the multitude of tasks that you will be
asked to accomplish during this summer's internship and during future
campaigns.

In Politics 421, you will be expected to work independently, complete group
assignments, make presentations on the readings, respond to electronic
postings, participate in occasional role playing, and attend skill-building
workshops or activities outside of assigned seminar class time. Your final
paper will be an analysis of the political players, issues, and profile
(economic, electoral, demographic, and social) of where you will be doing your
internship.

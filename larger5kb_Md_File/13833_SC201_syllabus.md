COURSE DESCRIPTION

  
  
SC201 introduces the student to the idea that the environment matters to
individuals, businesses, and society. It does this by examining how our senses
of being a part of (rather than apart from) our environment and of
responsibility to the environment have arisen. Readings and discussions survey
the place of environmental factors in history, the development of the "Green
Ethic," and strands of thought in environmental philosophy.  
  
See "Course policies" below for details on testing and grading. **

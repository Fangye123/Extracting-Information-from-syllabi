**History 521T is an intensive graduate level reading class designed to
prepare students for their M.A. exams at CSUF and for entry into doctoral
programs elsewhere, for those students intending to obtain the Ph.D. The
reading list for this course is, for the most part, the reading list for the
MA exam. As such, the course demands reading during the semester approximately
equivalent to one book per week, although some weeks students may read more
and others less. This will be a seminar course focused on the discussion of
assigned readings, some of which students will purchase, with the rest on
reserve in the Reserve Book Room of the CSUF library. Because it is a seminar,
the course will succeed only if students attend regularly and are prepared.
The instructor will pay close attention, therefore, to attendance and
participation in class discussion.**

**History 521 T is a topical course. This semester we will focus on Early
Modern Europe, and I will choose topics for each week that reflect the most
important historiographical trends and debates in the field: for example,
absolutism, peasant revolts, cultural history in print and film and women's
history. For five of the fifteen weeks of the semester, the class will read
and discuss one central work, and/or group of articles. For the other ten
weeks, several works will be listed on the syllabus, and on reserve at the
library. {** _ **NOTE: STUDENTS MAY HAVE TO OBTAIN THROUGH INTERLIBRARY LOAN
CERTAIN BOOKS NOT IN THE CSUF LIBRARY!**

_

**Each student in the class will read the equivalent of one book per week in
preparation for class discussion. Each student will be expected to prepare one
short book review (3-5 pages) per week on one of the books in the** **A
Readings@** **section of the weekly list during the course of the semester.
Students will photocopy these reviews and distribute them to the other
students in the class. Thus, each student in the class will by the end of the
semester have read at least 15 works, and will have about 20 other book
reviews. This body of literature, plus their bibliographic essays, will
provide the basis for their preparation for their M.A. exams.**



**In addition, students will prepare a comparative book review essay on all of
the books in the** **A Readings@ section of one of the weeks. This paper will
be worth another 40% percent of the final grade, and will be due the day of
the final exam. All short reviews will be due on a weekly basis. I will
subtract 10 points per day for each day which the papers are late. To succeed
in this class, it is imperative, therefore, that students keep up with the
reading. Otherwise, the class discussions upon which the class is based will
fail, and students will not derive the benefit in preparing for their M.A.
exams that they might otherwise obtain.**

**Learning Goals:**

**1\. Students will get a strong start in preparing for their M.A. exams in
the field of Early Modern European history by surveying significant literature
in the field. The topics are thematic and designed to acquaint students with
the primary historiographic problems and debates of Early Modern Europe, as
well as theoretical approaches.**

**2\. Students will improve their critical reading and analysis skills through
the book review exercises and class discussions. They will learn to
efficiently extract from monographs and essays the main arguments of the
authors.**

**3\. Students will hone their writing skills as well through repeated weekly
writing exercises. Students will be expected to take note of instructor
editorial comments and act upon them in subsequent papers to improve their
writing.**

**Requirements:**

**1\. A bibliographic essay worth 40% of the final grade.**

**2\. Ten short book review papers (3-5 pages), cumulatively worth 40% of the
final grade. (I will average the review grades together to obtain one
cumulative grade for this part of the assignment.)**

**3\. Class participation: 20% of final grade. Please note: class
participation means just that, active involvement in class discussions,
prompt, regular completion of assignments, and demonstrated efforts to improve
analysis and communication skills, especially writing.**

**Assessment:**

**In assigning grades in this class, I will be looking for three things: 1.
Quality of class participation, as defined above (Requirement, 3); 2. Quality
of analysis of the works you are reading; 3. Demonstrated efforts to improve
on 1 and 2. For example, I will not grade the early papers of the class on
writing, but I will look at grammar and style more closely as the semester
progresses, and especially on the final comparative book review essay.**

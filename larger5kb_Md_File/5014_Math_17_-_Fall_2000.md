## Course Description

The official description of this course is as follows:

MAT 360 Differential Equations

> A Study of ordinary differential equations including solutions to first-
order differential equations (exact, separable, linear, integrating factors,
homogeneous), solutions to higher order linear differential equations
(constant coefficients, undetermined coefficients, variation of parameters),
Laplace transform methods, and series soltuions. Prerequisite: MAT 230 or
permission of the instructor.

The area of differential equations is, in some respect, the reason Newton,
Leibnitz, and some of their predecesors created calculus. They were interested
in modeling (and, hence, predicting) the motion of the planets. While this
history is touched on throughout the text, our goal is to derive and discuss
various techniques for solving differential equations. This knowledge is most
useful for those studying physics; however, differential equations come up in
biology, chemistry, economics, and, of course, mathematics. In mathematics, we
are most interested in theoretical issues.

> The course can be thought of as containing four general areas:  
>  first order differential equations  
>  linear, higher order differential equations  
>  Laplace transform methods  
>  infinite series solutions

First order differential equations have been studied quite extensively. There
are five general methods for solving such equations and the goal of the
student is to have enough familiarity with these methods to quickly determine
which method to use and then use it to solve the problem. After we have
discussed these methods we look at various applications which give rise to
differential equations.

Linear, higher order, constant coefficient differential equations are attacked
in three stages--all presuming the coefficients are constants. We first look
at linear, homogeneous differential equations; i.e. zero right-hand side. Then
we generalize to linear, nonhomogeneous differential equations; i.e. a
function of the independent variable on the right-hand side. Lastly, we look
at applications that arise in physics.

The third part of the course is devoted to Laplace transform methods for
solving differential equations. To a great extent, this method is an algebraic
approach to solving linear, higher order, constant coefficient differential
equations. The different types of differential equations that can be solved
using this technique are primarily applicable to electronics.

Lastly, we develop the Frobenius method of solving linear, variable
coefficient differential equations. This method relies on infinite series
representations of solutions.

  

## Purpose

The purpose of this course is to  
1\. learn techniques used to solve problems that arise in science,
engineering, and economics,  
2\. improve your logical thinking skills.  
You have seen some of this material already in your calculus course.

## Professor

My name is Neil Eklund and I will be teaching Math 360 spring term, 2001-2002.
My office is Olin 114 and my telephone number is 238 - 5405. If you need to
speak with me, you may frequently find me in my office. I am usually in my
office between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. except for the hours I am teaching, the time
I choose to eat lunch, and the occasional (hopefully, rare) committee meeting
times. While I provide office hours, I encourage students to come to my office
for assistance at other times; I just promise to be available during the
office hours. You may also set up specific appointment times outside of office
hour times. You may call me at my office, contact me via e-mail at
eklund@centre.edu or call me at home; my requirements are that my home phone
ring the first time after 9 a.m. and before 9 p.m. (seven days a week). If you
call me at home and want help on an exercise, be prepared with the text,
paper, and writing instrument. To learn a little more about my non-academic
life, click on [
http:\\\web.centre.edu/eklund/personal](http://web.centre.edu/eklund/personal.htm).

  

## Textbook

Our textbook is **Fundamentals of Differential Equations, 5th edition** ,
which was written by R. Kent Nagle, Edward Saff, and Arthur David Snider and
is published by Addison-Wesley Publishing Company.

  

## Grades

Your grade for the course will be determined by the following:

25 daily quizzes | 125 points | 15 %  
---|---|---  
4 Exams | 400 points | 60 %  
Final Exam | 200 points | 25 %  
  
I use the following percentages for grades at the end of the term:

Grade Line | Ideal Percentage | Common Percentage  
---|---|---  
A-/B+ | 90% | 87%  
B-/C+ | 80% | 76%  
  
C-/D

| 70% |

65%  
  
D/U | 60% | 55%  
  
The "Common Percentage" is based on where the cut-off has been historically. I
try to find a place below the "Ideal Percentage" where there is a gap. Two
percentage is a gap in a course like Differential Equations. The common cause
for such lowering is that I hate to give a B+ to someone who has a 89.95% at
the end of the term.

  

## Exams

As mentioned above, there will be four exams during the term and a Final Exam.
These exams have already been scheduled. Please note that **no exam**
(including the final exam) will be given early to accommodate personal travel
plans. If you have an excused absence for a college activity, you must make
arrangements to take the exam at some other time and these arrangements
should, if possible, be made at least three days prior to the scheduled exam
time. The exams will take place on the following dates and times:

![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Exam |  Day, Date |
![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Time  
---|---|---  
![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Exam 1 | Monday,
February 25 | ![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) in-
class  
![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Exam 2 | Monday,
March 18 | ![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) in-class  
![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Exam 3 | Wednesday,

![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) Exam 4 | Wednesday,
May 8 | ![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif) in-class  
**![](http://personal.centre.edu/~mat/images/dot_clear.gif)**Final Exam |
Saturday, May 18 | 8:30 - 11:30 a.m.  
  


  

## Quizzes

Class periods when there is not an exam scheduled will consist of the
following approximate manner:

> 10 minutes to answer questions on the previous day's homework.

>

> 5 minute quiz consisting of one of the assigned homework problems from the
preceding day.

>

> 45 minutes discussing new material as indicated on the syllabus.

I believe there will be 28 quizzes during the term. I will use your 25 highest
grades (each quiz will be worth 5 points) to determine your quiz percentage
for the course. The fact that three quizzes will not be counted into your
grade provides for the possibility of a student missing "up to 3 classes per
term" due to officially sanctioned activities. There will be no make-up
quizzes given.

  

## Class Participation

Class participation is an important part of the course; mathematics is not a
spectator sport. For this course, class participation consists of class
attendance, reading assignments, quizzes, homework exercises, and in-class
group and board problems.

You are expected to attend every class. You have invested a large sum of money
for the opportunity to come to class and I will invest a large amount of time
and energy in preparing for class; let's not waste the investments we have
made. Any student who misses two days in a row without an official excuse will
be reported to the Associate Dean. Official excuses from a coach, wellness
center, or other official MUST be received by me via email at least one day
before the day that that class will be missed.

Students frequently ask how they might improve their grade in the class. (This
is usually asked late in the term when more than 50% of the grade has been
determined!) Here is my list of recommendations for doing well in this course.
Start using them now; do not wait!

  1. Take 10 minutes before class to read the material I will discuss in class that day; it will help you to see the direction of the class.
  2. Take notes during class. Leave room to enhance these notes later (after class).
  3. Work on assigned homework exercises as soon after class as possible.
  4. Use the following process as you work each exercise: 
    1. Work it on your own. If you succeed in 10 minutes, great; if not, 
    2. Look at worked out examples in the text in this section. If there is one similar to the exercise you are having difficulty with use scratch paper to solve their worked out example as follows: 
      1. cover up their solution
      2. work as much as you can
      3. uncover their solution to the place where you got stuck; then uncover the next line to, ideally, give yourself a hint on how next to proceed.
      4. Continue until you finish their example.
      5. Then go back to your exercise and see if you can do it.
3\. If step 2 does not help you, see if there is another student in our class
on your hall who can help you. By talking about it you may be able to figure
it out.

  5. Then see me.

## Office Hours

Office hours:  
3:00 - 3:30 p.m. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday  
1:00 - 3:00 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday

Moreover, I frequently can be found in my office 8:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.,
Monday through Friday, except when teaching (8 - 9, 10:20 - 11:20, 1:50 \-
2:50, MWF), eating (11:30 - 12:30), or at meetings. You may get help at these
times subject to my being there and my not having prior commitments.

When you arrive at my office, one of the following will be true:  IF | THEN  
---|---  
door open, nobody with me | come in while knocking  
door open, I am with someone | let me know you are there  
door open, nobody there | wait! I'll be back in 5 minutes  
door closed, note on door | note tells when I'll return  
door closed, no note | out to lunch or have gone home  
  


  

## Calculators and Computers

Although these are wonderful tools, proficiency in their use is no replacement
for genuine understanding of the concepts of calculus. You will be allowed to
use these tools except, possibly, during exams; however, as indicated above,
if they are permitted on exams, the exams will be written so that the type of
calculator you have will neither give you a distinct advantage nor a distinct
disadvantage over other students. You will be required to justify your steps.
You are therefore encouraged to be careful in how you choose to use your
calculators in doing your homework. The homework exercises are intended to
increase your understanding of the material and judicious use of these tools
may be appropriate. However, while doing your homework, you should also
attempt to simulate to some extent the exam environment which will determine
to bulk of your grade.

One resource that is available here at Centre is the computer algebra system
Maple. If you are interested, you can access Maple by clicking

Programs  
Maple 7  
followed by clicking the Maple 7 icon. Basic instructions for using Maple can
be found at:

or

[ Maple Primer](http://web.centre.edu/eklund/Maple.htm)

  

## Academic Honesty

Work on all exams should be strictly your own.

Collaboration on homework is encouraged (and expected), although, you should
first spend some time in individual concentration to gain the full benefit of
the homework. On the other hand, copying is discouraged. You should not be
leaving a study group or a help session with your homework ready to be turned
in; write up your solution sets by yourself.

  

## Disabilities

I encourage students with disabilities, including but not limited to
disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, and psychiatric
disabilities, and students dealing with other exceptional circumstances to see
Sarah Scott. She will explain the process used at Centre College to inform
teachers of relevant disabilities. You should not discuss this with your
teacher until your teacher has received some form of notification from Sarah
Scott and speaks with you.

  

## Questions

If you have any questions about this syllabus or about the material presented
in this course, come talk to me. Although, I do enjoy mathematics, I am not
here just to have fun. My primary goal is to help you learn and understand the
material we will cover. Your questions are an important part of your learning
process, and I can help you find answers. They not only help you but me also;
I learn what you, and probably others, find confusing in our course.

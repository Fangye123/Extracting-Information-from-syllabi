COURSE REQUIREMENTS

1. Reading and preparation to discuss assigned material before each class. Attendance and participation will be an informal factor in grading, with the exception of cases in which a student misses more than five classes, which will lower the grade by one-half of a letter. Eight absences will lower the grade by one letter. This is not intended as a punitive measure. It is designed as a means of relating the grade to the learning experience. In-class participation is an essential part of the course, and regular attendance and participation will clearly enhance the quality of the learning.
2. Three essays written out of class and based primarily on previously assigned material. You will select your own topic, but I will be a resource person for you. Guidelines are found at the end of the syllabus. The essays should be 1500-1750 words (six to eight pages) in length, typed, double-spaced. The three essay grades together will constitute 50% of the final grade.
3.  Five quizzes to offer a structure for familiarizing yourself with the subject matter. Each is 10% of the final grade.
4.   Instructor letters. Evaluated on a pass/fail system. The letters will not be graded, but failure to turn one in will deduct three points from the final average. (See further instructions below.)

For all papers, quizzes and other work, the Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work."




GRADUATE CREDIT

It is possible for students in fields other than History to enroll for graduate credit. In such cases, assignments will differ slightly. Please consult with the instructor.







SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS


I will be happy to make any accommodations necessary for any student requiring such under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Please contact me promptly if this is the case.




K-STATE ONLINE

Each student should set up an account on K-State Online. Here is how to do it:
Using a browser (Netscape 4.5 or higher is recommended) go to the URL: http://online.ksu.edu/. Click the "Create Account" Button.  Fill in the fields appropriately--click the help button on the bottom to see a description of what is expected in each field.  The system does require you to enter your social security number so that it can determine your course enrollment from the Registrar's records. The userid will be your login name.  It is suggested that you use the same one as you use for other accounts so that it will be easy to remember.  Passwords must be at least 5 characters long, must contain at least one letter and at least one number and cannot contain underscores.



INSTRUCTOR LETTERS

Twice during the semester (September 19 and November 9) instructor letters are due. This is your opportunity to be in communication with me about any topic that you wish to discuss. They will not be graded. The only requirement is that you turn one in by the dates indicated.
		 
		 





GUIDELINES FOR OUT-OF-CLASS ESSAYS
A. General criteria for historical writing


 
			
1. Development of an argument or interpretation. Good history does not merely tell "what happened." Instead, it interprets events of the past. Given the nature of your assignments, writing interpretive essays will not be difficult, but be sure that you convey clearly the argument or interpretation you wish to make. A descriptive title, a clear thesis-sentence in an opening paragraph, and a conclusion are important elements of communication. (20%)
2. Substantiation of your argument with historical data. While interpretation is the ultimate goal, every interpretation of a historical subject is meaningful only if it rests solidly on concrete evidence. In writing history it is important to demonstrate your evidence, not only to support your argument, but also because the details of human activities give history its interest and bring readers into the historical situation. Merely restating the conclusions of historians is not a good way to substantiate your argument. Using their data is what is important. (25%)
3. Utilizing historical perspective. What distinguishes history from other academic disciplines is its concern with change over time. Historians deal with all facets of human experience including economics, culture, religion, politics and social customs, but they always focus on how the issues they are investigating are shaped by the particular historical context. For example, historians know that they cannot explain the division of labor by gender in medieval Europe without particular attention to cultural, legal, political, religious and social factors unique to the Middle Ages. Moreover, historians always avoid judging historical situations by standards belonging to an era different from the one they are investigating. One would not, for example, criticize a pre-industrial European practice on the grounds of its being undemocratic, since democracy only became a socio-political goal in the eighteenth century. (30%)
4.  Clear communication. Use a precise, grammatical, well-organized writing style. (25%)
			 



B. Techniques to use in this assignment

				 
			
1. Choice of topics. Essays are to be written primarily from assigned reading material and discussions. They are not research papers in which the object is to uncover new material from library sources. The essays should give you the opportunity to make sense of a topic that personally interests you.
2. Using non-assigned material.
a. If you find that, in order to substantiate your argument, you need data not found in assigned readings, it is legitimate to use library resources. However, the major thrust of your argument should come from material you have read and discussed.
b. One of your three essays may be on a topic not specifically covered in the syllabus, although it should be within the confines of the geographical and chronological material discussed during the unit of study. This will allow class members to pursue their own interests and will broaden the scope of the course. All topics of this type must be discussed with me prior to the writing of the paper.
3.  Documenting sources. Formal footnotes are not required. However, it is important to identify the exact source(s) of your information in order to convey your method of utilizing information. The simplest way to do this is to indicate sources and page numbers in parentheses. For those sources assigned in class, abbreviated references can be made. For other sources, give complete bibliographical information. If you find it simpler to do so, use footnotes. Documentation of sources is a requirement.
4. Place your name at the end of the paper, not on a title page. Print a word count on the paper.

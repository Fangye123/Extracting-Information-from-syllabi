Derrida.  
>  2\. demonstrate a knowledge of critical schools from the classical through
the contemporary periods.  
>  3\. demonstrate an ability to synthesize, present, and discuss these
critical theories in short, critical abstracts and in-class discussions.  
>  4\. demonstrate a knowledge of some contemporary African-American literary
criticism and theory.  
>  5\. demonstrate the ability to discuss clearly these critical and
theoretical positions.

  _ **TEACHING MODES**_ :

Discussion, student papers, lecture, student-teacher evaluation, and essay
examinations.

  ** _REQUIREMENTS_ :**

> 1\. Students are expected to attend class.

> 2\. Students are expected to read all assigned selections before coming to
class on the day those selections are to be discussed.

> 3\. Students are expected to submit all assignments when due.

>

> 4\. Students should typed all out-of-class assignments.

> 5.  Students are to submit _**14**_ **CRITICAL ABSTRACTS** of approximately
3 double-spaced pages each. Students should select the works of authors for
these abstracts from the required reading assignments. **Seven** of the works
of these authors should come from the reading selections **before
midsemester** ( _classical theory_ ), while the remaining **seven** abstracts
should be from works of authors read and studied **after midsemester** (
_contemporary theory_ ). These abstracts should clearly express the main
points of the selected piece with a paragraph or two of reaction to the
critical or theoretical position explored in the piece. Students should submit
**TWO** copies of each of these abstracts: one will be evaluated and returned;
the other will remain on file. These abstracts will be submitted generally
once a week.

REVIEW** (3-5 pages) from the list of African-American Works of Theory and
Criticism at the end of this syllabus or a work approved by the instructor.
The report should sufficiently indicate the contents of the book (60%-70%) and
should further offer an evaluation of it (30%-40%). Again, students should
submit two copies of the review. In addition, students are required to submit
a printout from a search of the MLA Bibliography on CD-ROM, located in the

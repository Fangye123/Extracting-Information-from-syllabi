**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

Along with every other sphere of human activity, politics was transformed
during the Renaissance  
in Florence.  Indeed, there is a strong case to be made that modern politics
was born in Florence  
during the Renaissance..  This course explores that transformation, as an
especially revealing case  
study in political sociology, one which makes visible the most general
contexts of political change.

After introductory readings in socio-political theory - classic statements by
Max Weber and Edward  
Shils which provide a framework for the readings that follow - we will turn to
Dante's _**Inferno**_ , a  
masterpiece which can be read as a commentary on political corruption at the
end of the Middle Ages.  
We will then revisit Burkhardt's classic nineteenth-century study _**The
Civilization of the Renaissance  
in Italy**_, not only for its provocative historical insights, but also as an
important work of social theory  
in its own right.  Since Burkhardt's history takes us from Dante to
Machiavelli - from the very beginning  
of the Renaissance to its height - we will be in a good position to engage
Machiavelli's **_The Prince_** , a  
seminal analysis of modern politics.  We will conclude with the most prfound
contemporary exegesis of  
Macchiavelli's theory, demonstrating the signal importance of Macchiavelli to
the Anglo-American political  
tradition -- J.G.A. Pocock's **_The Machiavellian Moment_**.  

It is a special privilege to be able to study these works in Florence, the
home of Dante and Machiavelli.  
Throughout the semester, we will follow R.W.B. Lewis's charming and literate
_**The City of Florence**_ as a  
guide to our own explorations of the very neighborhoods where Dante,
Machiavelli and other historical  
figures lived as they remade human understandings of politics and society.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**

The aim of this course is not only to help you master the content, but also to
help develop skills of  
reading, writing, and analysis that will enable you to engage seminal texts on
your own.  To this end,  
the course will be organized around regular in-class writing exercises about
central questions in the  
works we read.  you will review these exercises in small study groups before
we discuss them in class  
as a whole.  I will, however, collect a few of them at random, and they will
enter into your grade for  
class participation. (By the nature of a spot quiz, I will **not** administer
any make-ups)

You will write four papers, each between four and six pages, based exclusively
on your readings of the  
assigned texts.  I will expect you to write these papers carefully; I take the
quality of expression to be  
indistinguishable from the quality of content.

  * To earn a C or C+ on a paper, you must produce prose that is _**technically correct**_ \--    
without errors of syntax, grammar, diction, punctuation or spelling.

  * To earn a B-, B or B+, you must also present a **_properly organized argument_** :   
chains of claims and subclaims must be cogent, and you must support
appropriately  
qualified claims with warranted evidence.

  * To earn an A- or an A, you must also _**properly frame your argument**_ , by crafting   
an introduction and conclusion that not only state your most general of
claims, but  
also communicate the dialogic significance of your research problem by
demonstrating  
the costs of ignorance and disrupting some of your reader's assumptions.

Because I will run this class in a discussion format, it is imperative that
you attend all classes.  
Attendance is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for good
participation.  I will judge your  
participation by the conscientiousness of your preparation and the seriousness
of your attention  
to others, as well as by the thoughtfulness of your own comments.

Each paper will count for 20% of your course grade; class participation will
count for the remaining 20%.  
Excessive absence will of course detract from your participation grade.  In
order to receive a passing  
grade in the course, you must complete all assignments.

**ATTENDANCE**

Regular attendance in class is essential and is considered a form of
participation.  
A record of attendance will be kept and taken into account when determining
the  
course grade. Those absent from more than two meetings will forfeit the 20% of  
the grade assigned for attendance and participation. Absences for medical
reasons  
require a doctor's note.

**

Requirements** :

1\. As indicated above, there will be _three brief written exercises_ , each
analyzing a specific historical document and 3-4 pages in length, due in class
on January 28, February 18, and March 14. As the texts to be analyzed in the
exercises will be discussed at these class meetings, THE EXERCISES WILL NOT BE
ACCEPTED AFTER THE MEETING AT WHICH THEY ARE DUE. (30%, 10% each)

2\. For the _final written exercise_ , students may choose one of two options:

1) The first option is divided into two parts.  
a. The first is to be a review of a Holocaust related _documentary_ film from
the "Jewish Heritage Video Collection" in Gelman (to the left of the Media
Resources Desk), which you may view at any time during the course (though I
urge you _not to leave it until the final week_ ) in Suite BO1 (The
Viewing/Listening Room). Recommended possibilities: "Lodz Ghetto," "Partisans
of Vilna," "Genocide 1941-45," "Kitty: A Return to Auschwitz," "Danzig 1939,"
"Weapons of the Spirit," "Shoah" (any 1 of the 5 videotapes), or (not in
Gelman, but if you can get a video-tape) "The Last Days."  
How does it relate to the material of the course; what did you learn from it
that enriched your understanding of the Holocaust; what advantage does it have
(if any) over written texts (primary sources and secondary works); what are
its strengths and weaknesses as a documentary?

b. The second part is to be a critical review of a Holocaust-related web-site.
Assess its resources as a learning tool about the Holocaust. Any of those
listed with the syllabus in Prometheus are good possibilities.  
You may, if you like, choose a "Holocaust-denial" web-site for your critical
review, but you will need to find this without guidance from the instructor.  
(30% - 15% each part)

**

or ** 2) A more traditional final paper: choose any _memoir_ by a Holocaust
survivor and write a 10-12 page _critical review_ of it as a source of
information and insight about the Holocaust. Do not just summarize the story:
evaluate what you are reading based on what you have learned in the course. If
you choose this option, submit a statement of your topic, indicating that you
already have access to the book, by April 11. (Elie Wiesel's _Night_ is not an
option for this, as I assume students will have read this already.) A
bibliography will be placed on reserve at Gelman.

3\. ALL STUDENTS MUST TAKE THE _FINAL EXAM_. (30%)

4\. Attendance, preparation, and informed participation in class discussions.
(10%)

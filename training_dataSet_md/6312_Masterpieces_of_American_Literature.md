**Course Description and Objectives:**  
This course serves as an introduction to American writing. It covers a range
of literary periods-from the 18th through the 20th centuries-and encompasses a
variety of literary forms-novels, poetry, short stories, essays, and
autobiography. While the structure of the course outwardly resembles a typical
survey, it will be itself a sort of work-in-progress, a dynamic study and
exploration not only of the works on the syllabus, but also of our own reading
of them. We are not going to reveal the  "deep, hidden meaning" in literature.
Instead. we will use the tools of close reading and structural analysis to
read these texts as sources of ideas and for understanding literature as a
cultural practice. In addition to its primary objective, the course will
encourage you to cultivate proficiency in critically alert reading, and
analytical thinking and writing.  
The works I selected for this particular syllabus conform to a loose agenda:
all are "radical"-root-in some way. They are root or basic texts in American
literature; or, paradoxically, they challenge prevailing notions of
literature; they promote fundamental personal or social change; and/or their
authors move outside prescribed social behavior. I propose we treat the
syllabus as a point of departure to investigate an ideology of the radical:
What constitutes the radical? Can it ever be mainstream? How does it function
in literature? In the culture that produces the literature? In the culture
that consumes it? The results of such an open-ended investigation might be
less obvious than would first appear.  
The class is based on discussion rather than on lecture. You are expected to
complete each reading assignment on time and to participate in the discussion.
The reading and writing schedule is rigorous. Count on spending three hours of
work outside class for every hour spent in class. Reading for this class means
giving your whole attention to the structure, the style, and the content: an
active and thoughtful engagement with the text that enables you to make
informed interpretations.

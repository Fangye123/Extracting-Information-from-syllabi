#### Description

The course has two main goals:

    1. To examine the events which resulted in the destruction of European Jewry during the Holocaust, and 
    2. to investigate some modern Jewish and Christian interpretations of this destruction. 

The course is divided into two main sections.

    1. In the first section, we shall study the Nazi rule in Germany and Europe, its destruction of European Judaism, and the actions of those nations who participated in WWII. This section focuses on the events of the Holocaust. 
    2. The second section of the course studies some Jewish and Christian responses to the destruction of 6,000,000 Jews during WWII. Because the Jews play a crucial role in Christian, as well as Jewish, theological systems and because those who destroyed the Jews were Christians, both Jewish and Christian thinkers have undertaken a good deal of self-examination in light of the Holocaust. For this reason, studying their interpretations of the Holocaust will provide us with a good entry into some of the major issues facing the two major religious groups of the West. This section focuses on theological interpretations of the events of the Holocaust.

#### II. Requirements

    1. Each student is expected to complete the reading assignments for each topic before class. In addition, each student is expected to attend each class session and to participate actively in the discussions. 
    2. On March 19 each student will hand in a 7-10 page paper discussing Different Voices. The paper should address the topics of whether or not the female perspective on the Holocaust offers us unique information and whether or not women experienced the Holocaust differently from men. The paper should respond to specific writers and essays in the book. 
    3. There will be other shorter writing assignments during the semester. 
    4. There will not be a midterm or a final for the course.

**Course Description:**  
The purpose of this course is to introduce the theories, research and
applications that constitute psychology. Our goal is to help you become an
informed consumer of psychological knowledge. By the end of the course, you
should be able to better understand events and relationships, particularly
those that have an impact on your life.

**Course Requirements and Grades:**  
Your final grade will be determined by your performance on the quizzes, course
projects, group exercises and the final exam. Each weekly assignment will be
worth 20 points. You will be able to drop the two lowest grades. There will
also be 50 points given for selected class attendance and participation. There
will be opportunities for extra credit based on participation in biofeedback,
participation in research projects or attendence of lectures we select.
Students can earn up to 6 points of extra credit. The final exam will be
cumulative and worth 50 points. We will assign final grades on the basis of
the total possible points that you receive in the course. We will use the
following formula: 90-100% (A- to A), 80-89% (B- through B+), 70-79% (C-
through C+), 60-69% (D),  <60% (F). There will be no restriction on the number
of students falling into any particular grade category.  
_**This will be a very large class. Therefore, we ask that you keep all of
your paper assignments and quizzes for a few months after the course has
finished. This will help us in case there are any concerns with your final
grade.**_

**Access for students with disabilities:** Students who have any disability
that might affect their ability to perform in this class should inform the
instructor at the beginning of the semester. Adaptation of methods, material,
or testing may be made as required to provide for equitable participation.
Please register with the Disabled Students Office, Salazar 1049.

**Classroom Culture:** For the benefit of ALL the members in this large class,
we would like to remind you to turn your beepers and cellphones off during
class, not to smoke within 15 feet of Stevenson Hall (a campus policy) and
limit your talking to class-related topics. In a large lecture hall, even
whispered conversations between two students will prevent other students from
hearing class discussion and lecture. We expect active class attendance which
includes asking questions, participating in class demonstrations and
discussions and taking notes.

**Missed Assignments:**  
There will be no make-up examinations for any reason, other than serious
illness, overwhelming personal crisis, or the rare event that you have three
examinations on the same day. You must provide written documentation from the
appropriate authority before the make-up exam will be scheduled. If written
coursework is turned in the week following the deadline, five points will be
lost. Five additional points will be lost for every week that the paper is due
after the first week.

**Academic Integrity:**  
We are committed to a code of values that honors academic and personal
integrity, honesty, and ethical standards. We expect students to complete
their own work. When a student refers to ideas of another person, we expect
students to acknowledge this work by appropriate citation. Examples of
academic dishonesty are listed in the Psychology Department's policy
[(http://www.sonoma.edu/psychology/AcademicHonestyPolicy.html](http://www.sonoma.edu/psychology/AcademicHonestyPolicy.html))
and the university policy on academic honesty (Sonoma State University Policy
on Cheating and Plagiarism, 2000, pp. 1-3). In this class, any incident of
academic dishonesty will immediately result in the attachment of a failing
grade for that particular assignment for all the individuals involved, and
may, at our discretion, involve some additional university disciplinary
action.

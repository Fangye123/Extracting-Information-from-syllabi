Tuesdays, 2-5 pm, 24-112
This graduate seminar will focus on Kant's practical philosophy. We will aim to cover
a large amount of Kant's philosophy in some detail, including the basis of his whole critical
philosophy in his general metaphysics of the human person, the various aspects of his moral
philosophy, his political philosophy, his philosophy of religion, and his philosophy of
history.
We will pursue two principal aims: first, we will attempt to develop the most accurate
interpretation of Kant's view, on the basis of an extensive, careful study of the texts; second,
we will attempt to assess Kant's views, to see how plausible they are, and what can be
learned from them. In pursuing these aims, we will also look at some recent scholarly works
on Kant, examining both their interpretations of Kant's views, and their evaluations of
them.
I have ordered a number of Kant's works for the bookstore, all of which are strongly
recommended.


Critique of Pure Reason, tr. Norman Kemp Smith (Macmillan, St
Martin's Press)
Foundations of the Metaphysics of Morals, tr. Lewis White Beck (MacMillan, Library of Liberal Arts)
Critique of Practical Reason, tr. Lewis White Beck (MacMillan, Library
of Liberal Arts)
Kant: Political Writings, ed. Hans Reiss, tr. H.B. Nisbett (Cambridge
University Press)
The Metaphysics of Morals, tr. Mary J. Gregor (Cambridge University
Press)
Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone, tr. T.M. Grene and H.H.
Hudson (Harper & Row)
You may use other translations if you wish. For example, instead of 2., you may use Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals, tr. H.J. Paton (Harper & Row). Or, instead of 2. and 5., you could use
James Ellington, Immanuel Kant: Ethical Philosophy (Hackett), which contains
the Groundwork and certain parts of The Metaphysics of Morals (the
other important parts of The Metaphysics of Morals are in Reiss, Kant:
Political Writings).
Work assignments:


An in-class report, to be scheduled.
A term paper (15-20 pages or so), due after Thanksgiving break.
A revised version of the same paper, due at the end of the semester.


Reading: Works of Kant
All English translations of Kant published since Norman Kemp Smith's 1929
translation of the Critique of Pure Reason are tolerably accurate. None is ideal.
You may use whatever translation you want. (For Kant's practical philosophy, the best would
be the new volume in the Cambridge Edition of the Works of Immanuel Kant, Practical
Philosophy, ed. Allen Wood, tr. Mary Gregor (Cambridge University Press, 1996), if
only it did not have quite so many misprints.)
We will be paying at least some attention to all of the following main works of
Kant:


1781: Critique of Pure Reason, 1st (A) edition
1785: Groundwork for the Metaphysics of Morals
1787: Critique of Pure Reason, 2nd (B) edition
1788: Critique of Practical Reason
1790: Critique of Judgment
1793: Religion within the Limits of Reason Alone
1797: Metaphysics of Morals

In addition, we will be looking at some of his useful shorter writings:


1784: "Idea for a Universal History from a Cosmopolitan Point of View"
1784: "What is Enlightenment?"
1793: "On the common saying: That may be correct in theory, but it is of no use in practice"
1795: "Towards Perpetual Peace"

These shorter writings are collected together in a couple of volumes: both in Lewis
White Beck, ed., Kant On History (Library of Liberal Arts, 1956), and in Hans
Reiss, ed., Kant: Political Writings (2nd edition, Cambridge University Press,
1991).
There are also some useful points in Kant's Lectures on Ethics of 1775-80, which
are translated by Louis Infield (Hackett, 1980).
We will also be looking briefly at Kant's most famous target:

1748: David Hume, Treatise of Human Nature
Other important works that influenced Kant include Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The
Social Contract and Discourse on the Origins of Inequality, and the works
of other British moralists besides Hume, especially Hobbes, Shaftesbury, Hutcheson, and
Adam Smith (Kant reveals no knowledge of the works of Butler or Price).
Useful volumes here are: D.D. Raphael, The British Moralists: 1650-1800,
two volumes (Oxford University Press, 1969; reprinted Hackett, 1991); J.J. Rouseau,
The Basic Political Writings, trans. Donald Cress (Hackett, 1987); and Jerome B.
Schneewind, Moral Philosophy from Montaigne to Kant, 2 vols. (Cambridge University Press, 1990).

Schedule of Topics and Reading
References to the Lectures on Ethics are to the translation by Louis Infield
(Hackett).
All other references to Kant's works are to the page numbers of the original German edition
published in Kant's lifetime. Where there were two different original editions, these are
distinguished by the prefixes "A" and "B".
Except for the Critique of Pure Reason, I also give references to the volume and
page numbers of the edition of Kant's collected works edited by the Royal Prussian (later
German) Academy of Sciences (Berlin: Georg Reimer, later Walter de Gruyter & Co.,
1900-    ). This edition is generally known as the Akademie-Ausgabe; these
references are distinguished by the prefix "Ak".
Almost all editions and translations of Kant give the pagination of either the Akademie-Ausgabe or the original editions in the margins.
Readings marked with an asterisk (*) are especially important.

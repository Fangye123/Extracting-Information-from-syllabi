**The History of American Technology**

Deciding how many muskets the military needed during the 1790s poses an
interesting historical problem, one that requires logic shaped by an
understanding of how many troops might need to be equipped, production
methods, maintenance limitations, logistics, and the strategic situation.

**How many soldiers needed muskets?**

> The surviving records from the 1780s and 1790s make it difficult to
reconstruct the size of the military forces (regular Army + militias) that
would create the demand for new muskets.  For example, 1789 is the earliest
year for which the government has published fairly reliable records, and
during that year the tallies show just 672 enlisted men and 46 officers in the
regular Army.

>

> Even the war scare of the mid 1790s did not produce an army that promised to
drain the supplies of muskets from the arsenals.  The government statistics
for 1794 show just 3,578 enlisted personnel and an estimated 235 officers in
the regular Army.  In 1795, there were 3,228 enlisted and 212 officers.

>

> Perhaps a better measure of the number of soldiers likely to need muskets
comes from the reports of the reconstructed (militias include some estimated)
manpower requirements for the Continental Army and the militias of the
Revolutionary War (1775-1783).

**How could production methods affect the number of muskets needed?**

> The artisan methods for gunsmithing were labor intensive.  Forming one
barrel required 14 separate heatings in the forge to accomplish the welding
required, and one barrel required 1 1/2 hrs of labor input.   The lock and the
stock were the more demanding operations in gunsmithing.

>

> Producing muskets in the traditional artisan fashion was labor intensive \--
it required time.  When Congress authorized the establishment  of the
Springfield Armory in 1794, the annual quota for production was set at 4,200
muskets.  As the figures below illustrate, it took the approximately 100 men
and boys working in the armory several years to achieve their quota, and if
you look at the implied manpower requirements for wartime in the figures
above, it becomes clear that the armory couldn't wait for the outbreak of war,
or even a war threat, to begin stockpiling arms.

** ** | **1795** | **1796** | **1797** | **1798** | **1799** | **1800**  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
**Springfield Production** | **245** | **838** | **1,028** | **1,044** |
**4,595** | **4,862**  
  
Data Source: Purvis, Table 4.160  
  
Take note:  If we accept the 1800 figure as the output produced by 70 artisans
and 30 apprentices (the authorized staffing in 1794) we get a nominal
production of just under 50 muskets per year from each worker.

  
**How did the maintenance limitations increase the number of muskets needed?**

> This one is fairly simple:  If making the musket required skilled labor for
custom manufacturing for each part, what did repair require?  The same thing.

>

> A broken hammer, stock, barrel, or trigger required the services of a
skilled artisan to custom manufacture the replacement.  Effectively, muskets
had to be sent "back to the manufacturer" for any significant repair.  
>

**How could logistics increase the demand for muskets?**

> Think about the requirement for skilled artisans to carry out any repairs,
then think about the transportation difficulties of the early Republic.  The
only really practical solution to the repair and maintenance problem was to
have a large supply of extra muskets available very close to where the troops
might need them.

Overall, while it's difficult to be precise, we can make some generalizations
about the number of muskets required to supply the Army's needs.  The largest
number of troops under arms during any year of the Revolution was just over
50,000.  That would furnish a base-line number, but when you add the margins
required to deal with any possible expansion, logistics difficulties, normal
replacement, and replacements for repairs, it becomes reasonable to assume
that even with a peace time army of just a couple of thousand troops the
government planners may well have wanted to maintain an inventory of 100,000
muskets, or more, in the arsenals.  Given the numbers available, I'd certainly
start my planning based on a number in that range.

If we accept a hypothetical number in the range of 100,000 muskets, the quota
set for the Springfield Armory would suggest a period of over 20 years just to
equip the Army with the muskets it might require if called upon to fight a war
on the scale of the Revolutionary War.

Just in case you haven't already worked out the arithmetic for yourself:  If
we accept the nominal productivity of about 50 muskets a year that we can get
from the Springfield armory production figures (admittedly a shaky figure), it
would require 2,000 artisans and apprentices to produce the 100,000 muskets in
a single year.

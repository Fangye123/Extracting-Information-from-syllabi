# Matewan

* * *

### Labor and Industrialization

This week (Wednesday, September 3 and Friday, September 5) we will be watching
the film _Matewan_ (John Sayles, 1987) in class. It is based on a true story
of coal miners at the Stone Mountain Coal Company in Matewan, Mingo County,
West Virginia who organized a union in 1920\. The result was a massacre on May
19, 1920, in which 12 people were killed in a shootout between local police
and miners, and thugs which the Baldwin-Felts Detective Agency had hired to
break their strike. The film shows conflicts between local, African-American,
and Italian miners, and their attempts to unify in the face of threats from
the Company and their hired gun. We will discuss the film in class on Friday,
September 5.

If you wish to watch the film again after we have viewed it in class, it is
available in the Media Resource Center in Milner Library as well as in local
video rental stores.

**Questions**

As we watch this film, keep these questions in mind:

  1. What are working conditions in the mine? How do they compare to working conditions in the meat packing plants as described in Upton Sinclair's _The Jungle_? How are workers paid?

  2. Why is the union anti-Black? How would you characterize union vs. African-American conflicts?

  3. How does racial tension play into the Company's wishes? What derogatory labels are used in the film for various ethnic groups?

  4. What was Few Clothes Johnson's response to being labeled a "scab"?

  5. Why are Italian immigrant miners hesitant to join the union?

  6. According to Joe Kenehan (the union organizer), what are the two sides to the struggle? What does working-class consciousness mean?

  7. What social problems and changes do immigrants face in this film? Is there pressure on them to assimilate into the dominant culture? What do they lose and what do they gain?

  8. How does Kenehan feel about using violence to resolve labor struggles?

  9. What tactics does the Company use to break up the union and its strike?

  10. What are the roles of women in this film? Are they just wives and mothers, or do they play a more significant role in the union, strike, and social struggles?

  11. Who is the narrator in this film?

  12. What would happen to the town of Matewan if the Stone Mountain Coal Company simply left?

  13. How does this movie relate to the major issues which we are developing in this class (immigration, militarism, labor, and democracy)?

  14. Compare this film to _The Jungle_. How does it end differently than the novel? How do labor struggles relate to immigration issues? Consider incorporating themes from this film into your essay on [_The Jungle_](jungle.html).

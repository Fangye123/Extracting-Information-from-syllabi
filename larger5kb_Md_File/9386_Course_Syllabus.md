The course examines major Middle East conflicts in their historic contexts.
Conflicts often seen as contemporary political disputes have deep historic
roots. In this region created from the remains of the Ottoman Empire, states
and societies still struggle to create an identity as well as free themselves
from the colonial Western domination that followed World War II. At the same
time they cope with the necessity of adapting to the demands of the modern
world. The course selects several topics and countries to provide a focus for
understanding the historical forces that drive the present states in the
region.

Topics include: the Late Ottoman Empire's struggle to resist Western
domination, Turkey's drive to establish a secular ethnically Turkish state and
its accompanying ethnic atrocities, the Arab experience with colonialism and
imperialism, the rise of Arab nationalism and Zionism, Persia's role as an
outsider, but Islamic state, state and nation building, Islam and its several
forms, Islamic renewal and its political effects, modernism and traditional
societies, familial life and the Islamic/Arab woman, the Arab-Israeli
conflict, and the Palestinian-Israeli struggle over Palestine.

The course will pay special attention to the Arab-Israeli conflict and the
role of the United states in the region. Thus students will read a general
history of the region, a specialized historical account of the Arab-Israeli
conflict, an edited collection of essays on the diverse origins of the
conflict that reflects contemporary historiography, and an historical
monograph on the region.

Course Objectives

>   * A knowledge of the regional variety of cultures and histories

>   * An understanding of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict as a complex

political Islam.

>   * Students will analyze a monograph on a topic that intrigue them and
write a five page paper on it..

>   * Students will hone their composition abilities.

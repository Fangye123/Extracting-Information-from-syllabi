**_Purpose of Course_**  
Taking a long historical perspective stretching from Greece in the 5th century
B.C.E. to Western Europe in the late seventeenth century, this course will
examine the emergence of a distinctive European culture by the eve of the
eighteenth-century Enlightenment. The course will introduce you to a set of
basic concepts, historical figures, and historical periods which have played a
crucial role in shaping western civilization. It will also encourage you to
begin "thinking like an historian", examining primary sources, considering
various historical interpretations of an event, and crafting your own
interpretations.

Because we are covering over 2000 years of history in just 14 weeks we will
not be able to cover every topic in depth. Lectures are structured to provide
an introduction to key historical periods, personalities and concepts and to
provide you with a sampling of the kinds of questions historians ask about
past cultures and societies. You will need to rely on your textbook and
collection of sources to fill in the political chronology and to deepen your
understanding of the topics we cover.

The lectures, discussion sections, and readings will particularly focus on the
connection between POWER, CULTURE and RELIGION in a given society. By the end
of the course you should have a clearer sense of the ways in which the very
nature of POWER in a given society was shaped by religious, gendered, social
and cultural hierarchies. By the end of the semester, for example, you should
be able to discuss how a Roman senator's power differed from a Greek
citizen's; how a Catholic bishop's power differed from a medieval vassal's; or
how a member of the House of Commons in England wielded a different kind of
power from an aristocratic woman in an absolutist court.  


To aid our interrogation of the connection between power, culture, and
religion lectures, discussions and readings will be focused on the following
key questions:

      1)SECULAR/SACRED   
What is the relationship between the secular and the sacred? Does a given
society believe that individual men or omnipotent God(s) shape human destiny?
What is the relationship between god-centered knowledge (religion) and man-
based knowledge and experience (science)?

    2) PUBLIC/PRIVATE   
What is the relationship between the public and private spheres? How does a
given culture differentiate between and value the "private" experiences of
love, intimacy, and individuality and the "public" experiences of politics,
community, group or nation?

    3) RURAL/URBAN   
What is the relationship between the city and the countryside? And how do
rural and urban communities differ in their social structures, politics, and
cultures?

    4) CITIZEN/FOREIGNER   
What is the relationship between the citizen and the non-
citizen/outsider/foreigner? Who is included and who is excluded from the
political community?

    5) MALE/FEMALE   
What is the relationship between men and women and between masculinity and
femininity? How do men and women's actual roles differ in a given society?

**_Format_**  
This is primarily a lecture course, but several times in the course of the
semester we will have discussions rather than lectures. Please note the times

that you come to class prepared to participate in the discussion.

_What did it mean to be a criminal in a place like South Africa?_  
From the beginning of settler societies in South Africa, crime has been a
major, if not _the_ major, preoccupation of its white rulers. Legislation
about  "vagrancy"and "undesirables" formed the backbone of South African law.
The earliest insititutions established in the Cape were prisons. When slaves
in South Africa rebelled, they were punished spectacularly. Pass laws
criminalized ordinary life for many African workers. Tsotsis (African
gangsters) and Mapantsula (stylish petty thieves) delighted and horrified the
public at large.  

True enough. But it is also the case that the earliest European settlers were
themselves dodgy characters--undesirables, schemers. White renegades from
Estienne Barbier in the 18th century to Eugene Terre-Blanche in the 20th
fought the state and became heroes for extremist Afrikaner nationalists. Top
ANC officials developed reputations for avoiding capture. Once in jail, Nelson
Mandela and other long-term prisoners turned Robben Island's penal colony into
a secret forum for self-education.

Finally, South Africa itself was for a long time viewed as an outlaw state,
illegally raiding and ruling beyond its borders, its military and police
committing violations of international and human rights laws. Vigilantism and
mafia-style killings, along with a scandalously high rate of sexual assault,
are major problems in South Africa today. It is no surprise that the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission adopted "crime"and "amnesty" as the proper framework
for confronting South Africa's violent past.  

_This is a Capstone and CORE diversity course._ Yes, we will have a lot of fun
reading about gangsters. But you will be expected to read, write, research
(with my, i.e. Prof. Landau's, assistance). We will graze the surface in our
collective readings; you will plumb the depths in your required 15-20 pp.
papers. Most of all, you must participate in discussions. Those who keep their
mouths closed all class, and rarely or never engage in discussion with their
fellow students will, without exception, be unpleasantly surprised by their
grade.

There is as yet only one book for purchase at the Bookstore: _Kortboy_. There
is also a course packet, available after Aug. 30th at BSOS copy center. Some
of the readings, however, will only be available on reserve at McKeldin
Library. It is up to you to schedule time early enough either to photocopy
them, or to take notes on them there. There are only twelve of you, so this
should not pose a problem.  

Each week a new person will devise three questions to ask the class. These
should provoke discussion about the collective reading, and not have simple,
quick answers.

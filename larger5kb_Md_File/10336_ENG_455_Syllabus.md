---  
  
##  Objectives

In this practicum, you will serve as an editorial assistant for [All American:
Literature, History, and
Culture](http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/allam.htm), an online
subject encyclopedia based at the University of North Carolina at Pembroke.
This experience will provide you with a unique opportunity not only to expand,
but to apply knowledge and skills that you have begun to develop in other
courses, particularly in the areas of American literature, publishing, and
technology. Indeed, you will begin to think and act in a way that will prepare
you to enter graduate school or a career in a field such as journalism or
publishing. Specifically, we will proceed with these objectives in mind:

**Deeper appreciation of language and literature:** As you write and edit Web
pages on American authors, you will deepen your understanding of how language
shapes meaning in literature and will broaden your knowledge of linguistic and
bibliographic terms, formal features, and genres.

**Broader understanding of the humanities** : To study literature is to study
life. As you produce essays and other materials on literature and its
historical context, you will become more adept at analyzing human thought,
philosophy, and social issues.

**Expanded cultural literacy:** Because of the allusive nature of all
language, particularly literature, names constitute a crucial part of a
person's vocabulary. As we study literature and its context, you will expand
your cultural vocabulary to include the names of many people and characters,
places, events, and movements.

**Reading:** As you read challenging literature by American authors, you not
only will expand your vocabulary and your ability to extract meaning from
sophisticaed syntax, but also will learn to infer information about audience
and purpose, thus preparing yourself to interpret the complex, often veiled
messages you encounter in law, business, and the media.

**Research:** In addition to working with several standard literary reference
materials and polishing skills in paraphrasing and documentation, you will
practice finding and using primary sources, including editions and
manuscripts.  

**Communication:** Your editorial duties will provide ample opportunity to
improve your communication skills, particularly in the areas of writing and
editing, speaking, and graphic design.

**Technology:** To complement these other skills, you will learn to make
effective use of technology to find and share information. By the end of the
course, you will be able to find material on the World Wide Web through a
variety of means, communicate via a listserv, and design and edit material for
publication on the World Wide Web.  

#  Be Your Best

You can expect me to be the best teacher I can be. I will work hard to make
this course interesting and rewarding. I expect you to be your best, as well.
Although this course is no more difficult than most college courses, it
demands a lot of work, including reading and writing assignments, library
research, and study. I expect you to make these commitments, to turn in neatly
typed and carefully edited assignments on time, and--particularly because this
is an online course--to check your e-mail and the online forum each weekeday
for possible assignments and announcements. For tips on improving your study
habits, see [Be Your
Best](http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/markport/best/bestset.htm). |

Assignments

###  Format

During class on the day an assignment is due, you must turn in a 9x12 envelope
containing the following items in the order listed:

  * The first item must be a hard copy of your final draft. This draft must be typed in an appropriate font, such as 12-point Times, and must be bound with a paper clip. Your last name and the page number must appear on each page.
  * Behind this final draft must be all of the material you used or created in preparing this assignment, including rough drafts, notes, and photocopies of all sources you quoted or paraphrased.
  * The final item must be an IBM-formatted diskette containing all of your work on the assignment, including your outline, rough drafts, and final draft. This diskette should have a label with your name, e-mail address, and telephone number on it.

Write your name, e-mail address, and telephone number on the outside of this
envelope and turn it into me when I request it in class. If you cannot be in
class when I collect the assignment, you must notify me in advance. Failure to
follow these guidelines may result in an F for the assignment.

###  Criteria

Before you submit a final draft of any assignment, please review the following
criteria, which I will use in grading each assignment:

  * **Content** : The project should thoroughly and insightfully address its subject with accurate, credible, timely, and relevant information. If the project is supposed to be argumentative, it should state a clear, substantive, contestable, and precise claim early and support this claim with appropriate evidence.
  * **Clarity** : The project should present information in a clear, logical fashion. In particular, paragraphs generally should begin with precise topic sentences, followed by clear, well-organized sentences that support the topic sentence. The writer should use transitional words and phrases effectively to guide the reader through the information.
  * **Readability** : The project should engage the reader with lively, concise writing and should generally lack typographical errors, as well as lapses in tone, register, punctuation, spelling, word choice, and grammar. The project should effectively incorporate source material with proper use of attribution, paraphrases, and quotations. Longer projects should begin with an engaging introduction and include a satisfying conclusion.
  * **Format** : Parenthetical citations and the bibliography or list of works cited should conform to MLA style. The project also should have an attractive, professional appearance and should conform to any particular format requirements set by the instructor.

**Note** : Each project must be your own work. That is, except for properly
cited quotations, every sentence and phrase must be in your own words. All
interpretations, except for those properly cited, also must be your own. If
you turn in someone else's work, use a source's exact words without placing
these words in quotation marks, or use an interpretation you found in a source
without giving credit to the source, you may fail this course. You must be
prepared to prove that you have done all your own work by showing me your
sources and discussing the details of your project with me in conference.

Using a point system, I will assign grades as follows:

  * **A (90-100 percent):** This project clearly meets all of these criteria, although it may contain one or two very minor lapses.
  * **B (80-89 percent):** This project contains a few minor lapses, but otherwise generally meets the criteria for an A.
  * **C (70-79 percent):** This project may contain more than a few minor lapses or one major lapse. Nevertheless, it adequately meets the requirements of the assignment.
  * **D (60-69 percent):** This project may be strong in one area, but it contains many minor or major lapses and, as a result, does not adequately meet the requirements of the assignment.
  * **F (below 60 percent):** This project contains plagiarism or an overwhelming number of lapses that make it an inadequate response to the assignment.

Furthermore, when the semester is complete, I will consider some of the
material you produce for publication on [All American: Literature, History,
and Culture](http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/allam.htm), a World
Wide Web site that I manage. Thus, by working hard in this course, you not
only will learn a great deal about literature, improve your writing and
research skills, and practice using new computer technology, but may have one
or more electronic publications that you may cite in resumes and portfolios.

###  Editorial Duties

As an editorial assistant, you are responsible for helping to make [All
American: Literature, History, and
Culture](http://www.uncp.edu/home/canada/work/allam/allam.htm) an accurate,
credible, clear, timely, and attractive source of information on the World
Wide Web. Specifically, you will:

  * analyze other online subject encyclopedias on American literature, history, and culture and submit a report on ways that we can learn from their strengths and weaknesses;
  * write and post annotations assessing these Web sites' credibility and thoroughness;
  * maintain a calendar of upcoming events on American literature, history, and culture;
  * edit other students' Web sites for accuracy, readability, consistency, and graphic appeal;
  * monitor the Web site and fix problems such as broken links.

###  Web Page on Literary or Historical Period

In this page, which also will be a candidate for publication on _All American_
, you will write an overview of a literary or historical period in America.
This page, which you should aim at readers with little or no knowledge of
American history or literature, should include the following elements:

  * a title bar naming the period;
  * a byline featuring your name, followed by a line saying, "Student, University of North Carolina at Pembroke";
  * a 1000-word essay that describes major people, trends, and developments in this period and supports these points by referring to at least two articles or books by scholars;
  * an annotated bibliography that analyzes the content, timeliness, and credibility of at least two useful sources on this period;
  * a sidebar featuring a chronology of the period;
  * links to at least two relevant Internet sites, such as sites with pictures or information relevant to the period.

###  Presentation

Using presentation software, such as PowerPoint, you will demonstrate
classroom and individual uses of _All American_ for an elementary, high
school, or college English class. In this presentation, you will make students
familiar with the resources on our site, show them how to use these resources,
use material on the site to run a sample class activity, and solicit feedback
on the site from the students and their teacher.

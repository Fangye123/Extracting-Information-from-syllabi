**Course Purpose:**  
The purpose of this course is to discuss biological principles which are
unique to women, including the developmental, reproductive, and aging
processes. In the process of these discussions, we will explore how our
society and its institutions have impacted the creation and interpretation of
this biological information.

By the end of the semester, each student will have an in-depth understanding
of the biological processes unique to women, and will be able to better
understand these processes within the social context in which we live.

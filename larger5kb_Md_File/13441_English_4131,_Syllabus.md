**Course Summary**

> Action, adventure, jealousy and, passion; fabulous monsters, gods and
mortals; a macho hero. faithful and faithless wives, husbands, brothers and
sons; a guy who stays away from home for twenty years; a queen who loses all
for love; a man with a mission, and a soul in hell: To read Homer, Virgil and
Dante is to meet the greatest story-tellers the world has known. People have
been trying to measure up to them ever since.

>

> We'll read parts of _The Iliad, The Odyssey, The Aeneid,_ and the  "Inferno"
secction of Dante's _Divine Comedy._ Intimidating? Students constantly tell me
they postponed taking this course because they were terrified by those great
names.Then they tell me how much they wish they had taken it long ago
because:the epics are so wonderful, and They would have _really_ understood
what all the other writers were talking about.

>

> Classics are classics because people keep reading them, generation after
generation, century after century. And begining at the beginning always helps
to keep things straight.

> **Course Objective:** To read, understand, discuss, and write about epic
masterpieces of Greece, Rome and Medieval Europe. Reading the texts more than
once is important. _While the principal goal of this course is study of
ancient and medieval literature, University College requires clear and
effective writing as an integral part of all coursework._

> **The Paper:  
>  ** The typed, double-spaced, four to six page paper should focus on a _very
specific topic_ of literary analysis, such as explicating a brief passage or
exploring the significance of one character trait in a major figure of one
literary work. Although augmenting the lectures and discussions by reading
about authors, works, and the background of classical and medieval literature
is very useful indeed, research is not required..

>

> **Writing Consultations:  
>  ** I will hold individual conferences on writing-in-progress with each
student beginning early in November. You are welcome to schedule more than one
conference. I am also happy to consult with you by phone at any civilized
hour. Phone, fax, and e-mail contact information appears at the top of the
syllabus. I am always pleased to respond to a paper draft _or_ drafts, since I
value being a _teacher_ more than I value being a _judge_.

>

> **Exams:  
>  ** You will write your exams in class, but I will distribute the questions
the week before so that you may prepare a considered response to the questions
you choose. You may use the text - and prepared notes on 3 x 5 cards - during
the exam, but you may not merely re-copy an already written essay.

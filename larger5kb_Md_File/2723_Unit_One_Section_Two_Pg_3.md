III. Introduction to Discussion & Interactive Exercises  
This course is interactive. There are no quizzes _(except 2 diagnostic, non-
graded quizzes)_ midterm or final examinations in this course. As explained in
the [Learning Objectives](u1s2p2.htm), students will develop several types of
knowledge and abilities. This section will introduce the methods of discussion
and interaction exercises that form the _basis of this learning experience_.
The fundamental assumption is that students are capable of processing
information and thinking about it in creative and analytical dimensions.

Interactive Discussions on the Web:  
Based on the Visuals, Readings, Film and general discussions, there will be
discussions scheduled that can be accessed on the [Dialogues
Page](http://129.101.144.59/levine/disctoc.htm) at dates according to the
[Course Time Schedule](schedule.htm).  
There are four discussion areas:  
Discussion Area # 1: [**Visuals Based Discussions**](_visuals/toc.htm) ****  
Discussion Area # 2: [**Reading Based Discussions**](_Reading/toc.htm) **  
** Discussion Area # 3: [**General Discussion Zone for
Students**](_discuss/toc.htm)  
These Discussions can also be located from the Navigation Bar, [
Help](hot.htm), and the [Discussion/Interactive Exercises Map](discussi.htm).
An electronic discussion is asynchronic, in that it takes place over a period
of time, usually several days. The discussion format will be a **Threaded
Discussion Form** **** where students fill in their responses to particular
questions. The responses are automatically posted for the discussion group to
read with a contents included of all responses.  
  
Essays  
The three essays are based on the assigned readings authored by Ceram, Aries
and Ruis. Each essay assignment is explained in the unit, and due on the date
given in the [Course Time Schedule](schedule.htm). Each essay will be limited
to between 4-6 pages. Students may submit their written work by mail, fax, by
placing in the instructor's mailbox at LCSC, or written on the scrolling form
given on the essay assignment page. Students can always check the proper
addresses by pressing [Contact Info](contact.htm) on the navigation bar.  
  
Interactive Exercises  
There are fourstudent exercises that will allow the students to better
understand the realities of the content and practice of social science.
Students will be expected to link the material of that social science unit to
some designed exercise. As **there is no physical class meeting** , it is
particularly important that students do plan other forms of interaction. Each
exercise is explained in the unit, and due on the date given in the Course
Time Schedule. Each exercise will have its own Form for students to submit
their work.  
  
Final Student Project  
This project will be a 6-8 pages and will allow students to integrate their
learning experience in the course. The assignment will be explained in Unit 8
and due at the end of Unit 10, see the [Course Time Schedule](schedule.htm)
for further information.

Discussion Dynamics:  
Discussions will be based on several themes. Student preparation of their
essays will also aid them in formulating their ideas. However, beyond this
discussions can be enhanced by keeping in mind a few discussion roles:  

| **Initiating:** ****  
Introduce yourself and your major when you answer your first question box in
each discussion.  | **Giving & Asking for Information** _  
_ Assume that your fellow students may know the answer to something that you
wondered about in the reading.  
---|---  
**Giving & Asking for Reactions  
**If you are a shy person or a curious person, do not be afraid to put your
point forward and ask that students react to your idea. In addition, respond
to the ideas of other students, and not just focus on your own points.  |
**Restating & Giving Examples** _  
_ When was the last time you had an argument because of miscommunication? An
important discussion skill is to concretely restate or give an example to
clarify what another speaker has put forward. You might be surprised that you
didn't understand their idea.  
**Confronting and Reality Testing** _  
_ You have the right, even the responsibility to disagree from time to time.
However, there is constructive disagreement and unconstructive disagreement. _
**Name calling, denigrating the intelligence or abilities of your classmates
is not only uncivil, but it will not be tolerated in this course**_ _._ If you
do not agree with an idea, mention that there might be merits, but you do not
think it is totally correct. You would suggest . . .  | **Synthesizing &
Summarizing  
**This is a very valuable discussion skill and will be included in the web
discussion format, as well as the essay assignment. How to integrate what we
learn with other learning and life experiences, even with the discussion
itself enhances the value of the exercise for everyone.

V. Feedback to Students and Contacting the Professor

![wpeA.jpg \(5016 bytes\)](images/u1s2p34.jpg)

_**On Feedback:**_ __ Since students are expected to do their work in a timely
and diligent fashion, the professor will give systematic and timely feedback
on student work. From time to time the student may receive questions or
comments from the professor by email.

_**On Contacting the Professor**_ : There are several methods of contact,
including the traditional **** office hours, which are listed on the [Course
Time Schedule](schedule.htm). The philosophy of education in this class is
that student feedback _is important,_ and that learning is a dynamic
enterprise.  Students can always check the proper contact information by
pressing [Contact Info](contact.htm) on the navigation bar. If student
questions about the course which are submitted by email can be of interest to
other students, the teacher reserves the right to post them to the entire
class.

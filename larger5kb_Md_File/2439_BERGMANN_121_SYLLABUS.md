Honors 121  
Reading Cultural Signs  
Fall 1999

 _Course description_ :  
In this course, we will "read" contemporary American culture. We will study
our culture's signs and symbols using an analytic method called semiotics. The
method is used in many academic disciplines (sociology, literature,
anthropology, psychology, history and philosophy) and in new interdisciplinary
academic disciplines, like cultural studies. What we're interested in is how
signs and symbols -- appearing in everything from Big Macs to contemporary
politics and novels -- make the meanings of our daily lives. We'll learn how
to analyze, particularly how to analyze in writing, and we will work to reveal
the mythic systems that govern the way we think and live. Discovering meaning-
systems in the very objects around us can be fun but it also demands care and
generosity because we are working close to things that people often feel very
strongly about.

 _Office hours_ :  
My office is A417 Robinson, in the Department of English. Telephone number
993-1196 (voice mail is at that number too). E-mail me at "hbergman@gmu.edu."
Please don't hesitate to make contact, even if over the phone or e-mail.
Please give me your e-mail address and I will distribute them to the whole
class -- if Honors has not done that already, I mean. My hours this semester
are Tuesdays from 10-11 and by appointment.

 _Requirements:_  
We will discuss all this at some length, but let me say that I will ask you
to:  
1) do the reading fully and on time, and be well-prepared to discuss it
thoroughly with the class. Constant attendance is essential. (Evaluation of
this is 10% of the grade)  
2) Write four formal papers (worth 10%, 15%, 15%, and 15% of the grade)  
3) Write seven 1-2 page microanalyses (worth 30% of the grade)  
4) Work together with others on a group project (worth 5% of the grade)

 _MicroAnalyses Assignments_  
30 % of your final grade in  "Reading Cultural Signs" will be based on short
(approximately 1 page typed single-spaced) responses to issues that arise in
the reading, discussion, and/or other work we do for this class. These are
designed to help you to prepare for class discussion, to reflect on the
readings, and to apply the results of what you are learning. I will give you
suggestions for microanalysis assignments for many classes when you do not
have any other papers due. Some will be given in writing, others verbally in
class. Microanalysis assignments are due at the beginning of the class for
which they are listed. You will not get credit for late assignments. You
should write them after you have done the required reading or work for that
day's class and turn in only one per class. They are intended to he
analytical: you should be able to formulate and support a position with
evidence in each one,

 _Honor in Honors 121:_  
The following rules go without saying, but I'll say them anyway:  
1) all work you do for the course must be entirely your own. Sources you use
must be properly credited (see conventions in Hacker or MLA Style Sheet
[Honors 110])..  
2) Your work must be your own new work, done for this course alone.  
3) You cannot receive a passing grade in the course if you have not completed
all assignments.  
4) Late work is not acceptable. (Contact me before due date with serious
problems).

 _Grading policies_  
Eventual grade will be one of the following: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D and F.
You will earn numerical grades so you will always have a clear indication of
what your grade will be.  
A (93-100%); A- (90-92%). These grades are awarded for superior understanding
of all concepts, for sophisticated presentation in written work, and for
forceful and imaginative interpretation and analysis. This is work from which
a teacher learns.  
B+ (87-89%); B (83-86%); B- (80-82%). These grades are awarded for above
average mastery of the concepts, for clear and thoughtful written work, and
for convincing interpretation and analysis.  
C+ (77-79%); C (70-76%). These grades are awarded for sufficient mastery of
the concepts, for competent written work, and for reasonable interpretation
and analysis.  
D (60-69%). This grade is awarded for less than satisfactory mastery of the
concepts, for poorly conceived and executed written work, and for weak
interpretation and analysis. There are usually serious writing problems in the
written work.  
F (59% and below). This grade is awarded for work unacceptable as college
level work. There are usually serious writing problems in the written work.  
0 (0%). Work not handed in receives a  "0" grade and is averaged as "0%." But
please note the additional rule that you must complete all work in the course
to receive a grade at all.

**2000 UM Undergraduate Catalog Data:**  
CSCI 111. COMPUTER SCIENCE I. Introduction to computer science with emphasis
on problem solving and algorithm development. Using a high-level, block-
structured programming language, students design, implement, debug, test, and
document computer programs for various applications. Corequisite: MATH 123 or
125. (3).  
  

* * *

  
  
**Prerequisites:**  
See above. Math 123 (Trigonometry) and Math 125 (Basic Mathematics for Science
and Engineering) are listed as corequisites. That means that you must have
completed an equivalent course (possibly in high school) prior to enrollment
in CSCI 111, or be enrolled in one of these courses at the same time that you
enroll in CSCI 111. It does not mean that you must enroll in these courses if
you have already completed such course(s) in the past.

(This is the edition that includes a CD with sample programs, etc.)  
  
Note: There are several slightly different versions of this book, with
different ISBN numbers: softcover vs. hardcover; with CD vs. without CD. There
is also a completely different book by the same authors, covering the material
for the second semester data structures course, CSCI 112.  
  
The bookstore on the University of Mississippi campus, and other bookstores in
Oxford, should have copies of the textbook available for you to purchase.  
  
You might also want to consider online shopping for your textbooks. The
publisher, [ South-Western Educational Publishing](http://www.swep.com/), has
an online shopping site that may be worth visiting.  
  
Dr. Cunningham (another CS faculty member at UM) has prepared a [ list of
online bookstore web

online textbook sites reviewed in the May 1999 issue of _Yahoo Internet Life_
magazine are: [www.efollett.com](http://www.efollett.com),

**Course goals:**  
The purpose of the course is to give students the opportunity to develop
programming and problem-solving skills. Topics to be covered (as specified in
deliberations of the entire CS faculty) include the following:

  * WWW/Email/FTP 
  * Syntax and semantics 
  * Problem solving 
  * Coding 
  * Documentation 
  * Testing 
  * Wolf-trap debugging 
  * Determinism   
  

  * Overview of computers   
  

  * Simple data types 
  * Arithmetic expressions 
  * Assignment statements   
  

  * Use of interfaces   
  

  * Boolean expressions 
  * Conditional statements 
  * Decision tables and switch   
  

  * Subroutines 
  * Functions 
  * Scope rules 
  * Reference semantics 
  * Parameter semantics   
  

  * Iteration and looping   
  

  * One-dimensional arrays   
  

  * Nested control structures   
  

  * Text file I/O   
  

  * Simple recursion 
  
  

* * *

  
  
**Applicability of CSCI 111 to degree:**  
CSCI 111 is the first required course in the B.S. and B.A. computer science
programs. It is also part of any minor in CS. Some other departments also
require CSCI 111 for their majors. Consult with your advisor if you have any
questions about the role of CSCI 111 in your program of study.

**[Sitting in on the class:](../sitting.html)**  
If you would like to "sit in on the class" without being enrolled in any way,
[click here](../sitting.html) to review my guidelines concerning this
practice.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Lab facilities and Java software:**  
Students can complete programming exercises using lab facilities located in
the CS department in Weir Hall. Students who have access to their own PCs can
use them for completion of exercises.  
  
All of the software needed for completion of the programming exercises can be
obtained at little or no cost. See the separate page concerning [Java
software](software.html) for additional information.

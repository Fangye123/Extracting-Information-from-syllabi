**Course Description:** First Year Seminar is intended to provide entering
students with a common experience in a small-class setting in which they can
begin to know other students and a faculty member. Currently the shared theme
of all the sections is human diversity. In this course we will explore
cultural relativism, the view that the source of morality is relative to
individual cultures and that diverse cultures have diverse moral systems. In
addition we will focus on the tension between accepting cultural relativism
and promoting human rights.

In connection with the common theme, during the first part of the course
students will explore concepts of culture and ethnicity, specifically as they
relate to assimilation issues facing immigrants and refugees. In the second
section of the course students will examine the theory of cultural relativism.
We will pay specific attention to how the ideals of respect and tolerance that
motivate those who endorse cultural relativism ultimately result in a position
that is at odds with the ideals that motivate supporters of universal human
rights -ideals which presuppose that all human being share a common dignity
and value which others are obligated to respect and protect universally among
all cultures. The later seems to require at least some objective moral
standards.

**Service-Learning**  
This course will include a service-learning component. Service-learning is a
method of teaching which allows students to apply academic material and
individual skills in the community in order to benefit the community and re-
enforce course material. Students will have a choice of two different service-
learning projects. One will involve being a "culture broker" to Somali
immigrants in Marshall, MN. In the other UMM students will work with Morris
Area elementary and high school students on a joint project connected with the
right to subsistence. Students will be released from some class time to
participate in community-based learning projects.

**Common FYS Goals:**

> To teach students to think critically and evaluatively and to write well

> To teach students to assess sources of information and use library resources
effectively

> To help students to become aware of their conceptions about culture,
ethnicity, and human nature

**Teaching Procedures and Accommodation for Disabilities:**  
This class will largely consist in class discussion and group work. It is a
high priority of mine to facilitate participation and exchange among all the
students. I will make accommodations necessary to guarantee to students with
learning or physical disabilities access to class sessions, course material,
and the activities of the class. Let me know within the first two weeks of
class if you have a disability for which you will request accommodation.

**Class Atmosphere:**  
Any true discussion involves personal exposure and thus the taking of risks.
Your ideas may not agree with those of your classmates. Yet as long as your
points are honest and supportable they need to be respected by all of us in
the classroom. Encouragement, questions, discussion, and laughter are a part
of this class, but personal attacks are not allowed. I want you to question
one another's points, but to do so in a way that does not call into question
the motives, intelligence, or character of the other members of the class.

**Class Policies**

_Attendance:_  
Class attendance is required. Learning is an active process. This class is
largely discussion-based, and it is not possible for you to participate in
class discussions if you aren't here. Students will be allowed two unexcused
absences. For each absence after that I will deduct a point from your final
grade. For excused absences, please get the required paperwork from the Dean's
office.

_Being Late:_  
When you make an appointment with a friend, you expect him or her to be on
time. Your employer, too, depends on you to arrive promptly each day.
Likewise, I plan to start class on time and expect that you will be there.
Occasionally, you may find it necessary to be late. In that case, I would
prefer that you come after class has started rather than miss the entire
class.

_Grading_  
Note that the First Year Seminar is a graduation requirement, but the class is
not repeatable. Students who fail this course will not be able to re-take it.
Also, be wary of getting a D in this course. Only 10 credits worth of course
credit with a grade of D can be put toward graduation. Students must complete
all class requirements in order to pass the class.

### NOTE ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: BE AWARE OF WHAT QUALIFIES AS PLAGIARISM!

If any student plagiarizes in writing a paper-that is, copies or closely
paraphrases from a source without proper quotation and acknowledgment of the
source (Including the Internet) -then that student will be given a failing
grade (F or N) either on the paper or in the course. Student papers may be run
through web programs such as Hand It In to determine whether the content of
the papers has been plagiarized from web sources. Any other academic
dishonesty, such as cheating on homework assignments or class projects, is
subject to the same penalty as plagiarism.

**Credits and Workload Expectations**  
For undergraduate courses, one credit is defined as equivalent to an average
of three hours of learning effort per week (over a full semester) necessary
for an average student to achieve an average grade (C) in the course. For
example, a student taking a two credit course that meets for three hours a
week should expect to spend an additional two hours a week on coursework
outside the classroom.

**University Grading Standards:** **A** |  achievement that is outstanding
relative to the level necessary to meet course requirements.  
---|---  
**B** |  achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet
course requirements.  
**C** |  achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.  
**D** |  achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet
fully the course requirements.  
**S** |  achievement that is satisfactory, which is equivalent to a C- or
better.  
**F** (or **N** ) | Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the
work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy
of credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the
instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I.  
**I** (Incomplete)      | Assigned at the discretion of the instructor when,
due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is
prevented from completing the work of the course on time.  Requires a written
agreement between instructor and student between instructor and student.

**Course Description**

In this course, we examine how Asian American writers re-invent the coming of
age novel (the bildungsroman) to broaden existing master narratives of
American identify formation. Our course will be divided among three sorts of
narratives: immigration narratives, narratives of second-generation identity
construction, and narratives emphasizing global or postcolonial perspectives.
We'll draw heavily upon Chinese and Japanese American literature--the core of
this subspecialty since its founding--and lightly upon texts from the still-
forming Filipino, Korean, and South Asian diasporic literature. We'll ask how
gender, class, generation, and national/ancestral histories inflect each
author's stories, and how these texts use and re-envision existing literary
codes and conventions to talk, implicitly, about issues that are not strictly
literary.

**REQUIREMENTS**

Papers 1 & 2 | 5 pages | 20% (each)  
---|---|---  
Paper 3 | 10 pages | 40%  
Presentation |  | 10%  
Class participation, attendance, homework |  | 10%  
  
Papers will be graded this way  
**A** |  This is original and outstanding work, conveyed in a clear and
consistent argument with no grammatical errors. In the best A papers, a
thoughtful, intelligent voice seems to speak; your argument engages closely
with the text and does not rely on broad, unsupported assertions; your
perceptions are unique, complex, mature, and clearly distinguishable from
others.'  
---|---  
**B** |  This is original work--not merely a summation of ideas explored in
class--conveyed in a clear argument with few or no errors. Your paper has a
specific, complex, debatable thesis and is grounded intelligently with
evidence from the text, or is otherwise complete, cohesive, and compelling.
This is a solid and respectable paper for an English major.  
**C** |  Although there are clear signs of effort here, this paper shows
errors of either grammar or argument. It may be an illogical or  
thoughtless reading of the text, or it may be poorly constructed. There may be
long stretches of unfocused plot summary. It is adequate but it is careless.
Usually, such a paper has a flawed or weak thesis.  
**D** |  The paper lacks a thesis. The paper has poor grammar and its argument
is poorly constructed. It is not persuasive, and it shows a flawed
understanding of the text.  
**F** |  The paper fails to meet the basic requirements of the assignment.  
Papers are due at the beginning of class (not the end!) BUT you may request up
to a one-week grace period if you come to class on time and prepared for
discussion. DON'T miss class to finish your paper. I am sorry, but I cannot
accept later papers.

_Attendance  
_ If you miss more than three classes without a certifiable excuse, your grade
will be lowered. If you miss 5, you risk failure. Attendance is taken at the
beginning of class, and chronic lateness will be factored in. Check in at the
end of the period if you arrive late. Active and positive class participation
is a plus; timeliness and excellence in homework asssignments will also be
positively viewed. Absence due to religious or ethnic holidays won't be
counted AS LONG AS you give me written notice the week before the holiday and
make up the assigned work on a timely basis.  

In case of extraordinary problems such as grave illness or unusual family
responsibilities, please tell me about these when they come up; don't just
miss classes and deadlines and come to me at the end for help. I'd like to
know what's going on.

_Prewriting/Journals  
_ From time to time you'll be asked to write a response to some focusing
questions in preparation for class, as a preparation for class discussion.
Come prepared to present your prewriting to the class, and to turn it in at
the end of the class period. I will read and credit them, and sometimes
respond informally in class. If I seem to misplace your assignment, let me
know right away.

_Plagiarism_  
Plagiarism, and its grave academic consequences, are encoded in your student
manual. Basically, you may not submit essays authored by others (published or
unpublished) as your own. You may cite and discuss others' ideas in your
papers, and this is encouraged. You may discuss a work in progress with a
classmate; if you do, I encourage you to credit him/her with ideas you've
picked up from him/her in a footnote. If you are unsure about whether a thing
is permissible, ask.

Culturally naive? Politically incorrect? This course deliberately introduces
such a wide spectrum of voices that none of us can be knowledgeable about all
the cultures (or literary modes) represented; so don't let this keep you from
speaking. Since this is fundamentally a course in critical thinking, I also
encourage you to speak out if you disagree with others, including the texts
studied, your classmates, and myself, or if you find something baffling,
disturbing, or exciting.

There are three primary crosscutting perspectives. There is, first, an historical perspective which is concerned with the chronology and currency of ideas. Just as important are the historical events propelling the development of the field both in its intellectual and pragmatic manifestations. A second perspective is cultural. This perspective illuminates how concepts are reflections of a distinctive set of values, ideology, and customs as well as preferred modes of reasoning. In this vein, understanding the epistemology and ontology of the field is key. The third perspective is analytical with an emphasis on the authority, justification, value, and "workability" of ideas; i.e., how they shape our thinking, both normatively and empirically and both intellectually and pragmatically.     Objectives (top) The purpose of this course is to introduce doctoral students to the historic intellectual conversations about the nature and scope of American public administration, public management, and public policy. This introduction will facilitate the ability to:  a. develop a "cognitive map" of the major contributors and their intellectual relationships; b. identify the major issues and questions in the field and some of the answers that have already been given; c. develop the ability to think critically, synthetically, and to develop new theory; d. learn the craft of writing academic papers.      Readings (top) Required: The following books are available at the SBX bookstore located on High Street: Shafritz and Hyde (4th Ed.). Classics of Public Administration. (S&H)  Perry, James L. (Ed.) (2nd Ed.). Handbook of Public Administration. (HPA)  Additional readings are available in Fisher Hall Student Lounge (FH) in the bottom drawer of the file cabinet. If you are going to make photocopies, please keep the original copies free of tears, folds and 'rabbit-eared' pages so that the next person has a clean copy from which they can work. The readings are sorted by date. I have also identified the call number for the books which generated the larger readings. Just click on the selections for which the title of the work has been made into a hyperlink. This will allow you to borrow those books from the library without incurring the cost of photocopying these larger readings.         Assignments (top) There are three assignments in this class.  1. The first assignment is to be prepared to discuss all of the articles assigned for the class. Most of the the readings tend to be quite short but, nonetheless, compact and intense. Class discussion will bring out the subtleties, connections to other works, and the relevance and power of these ideas for modern practice. I have made past summaries of readings available to you. If you are interested in how others have read and critiqued the class assignments or if you need help in fully understanding the readings, feel free to download these past summaries. (More instruction on uploading and downloading files are provided below). Summaries should be made available by Sunday night to the class so that we have enough time to read, think about, and formulate our questions before class. Each summary should consist of two parts. The first part should be a brief description of the main points of the reading. This will allow the reader to quickly identify the main contribution of the work. Please limit your use of direct quotes except where necessary. The second part should be a critique of the work. Review Appendix 1, below, for advice on how to write up a critique of your assigned readings. The main goal is, again, to identify what theoretical contributions are necessary for us to move forward on this issue. Please do not read the paper when you report out to the class.  To make the copies available to your colleagues, email a copy of your review in RTF format to everyone in the class (including the prof). Also, please upload a copy to our working library of reviews.  Please read this document on how to transfer files using email and FTP: (RTF) and (PDF).

The second assignment is to develop a 'theoretical eye' by looking at a current issue and identifying its latent theory and/or what theoretical questions may be important to dealing with that issue. We have two such assignments, one for the second week of the quarter (October 2) and one for the tenth week of the class (November 27). Please use the same approach as identified above to transfer files to the rest of the class.  		3. The third assignment is to write a manuscript which traces the intellectual development of an important issue or field of specialization within public administration. The primary requirement is that this topic be of interest to you (which usually means that it may have some relationship to your future dissertation topic). For example, one could trace the development of computers, budgeting or management science and public policy and management. The purpose of this assignment is for you to begin gaining mastery over a particular subject area in public policy or management. This is a first and important step in beginning your dissertation work and ultimately, your professional development as an academic. Appendix 2 gives some suggestions on how you might proceed with this assignment. I strongly encourage you to talk to me or your classmates frequently about your ideas or doubts. If you do not contact me, I will be contacting you. This is an iterative, non-linear process, so start learning how to do it. Here are the due dates:  1. October 2 - One paragraph description of your topic including an explanation of the issue, why it is important to study, how it fits in within your longer career goals; your plan on breaking the writing down into smaller, more manageable chunks (including dates), and the target journal (and secondary and tertiary journals should your article be rejected at the primary target journal). 2. November 6 - Rough draft of complete manuscript 3. November 27 - Final Paper - Including final plans for submitting the article for publication.

###  The Politics of the Oral and the Written:  
Feminism and Writing Technologies

What if writing had been invented to help escaped slaves? (Do you know what it
was invented for? Where? When? What counts as writing?) What if printing were
still used by people in "corresponding societies" for purposes of revolution?
(And what quite different sets of political purposes does mass publication
enable today?) What role did the fax machine play in the Tiananmen Square
democracy movement? (Or carbon paper in the former Soviet Union?) How is the
internet used today to subvert political, religious and sexual censorship?
(Where? For Whom?)

How obvious is a boundary between the Oral and the Written? Is it only one
boundary? In what places and times is such a boundary useful to draw? Who
needs it? For what purposes? This course is about the stories we tell about
such boundaries. It is about how unstable these boundaries, these notions--the
Oral, the Written--can be. In this course we will examine stories, tell
stories, write stories, interpret stories, change stories. Such stories are
about the movements of power: sex, race, class...gender, sexuality,
nationality...religion, revolution, representation. Whether we like it or not,
we are inside these stories. So, how do we seize the stories for ourselves?

  | **__Course Description:__**

         Criminal Justice in America is the introduction to the B.A. in criminal justice and a prerequisite for most upper level courses in the major. It covers crime, police, criminal courts and law, as well as corrections. At its core are questions of justice as suggested by the graphic to your left. Gaining knowledge in all these areas will help you progress through the more advanced courses.    
         In addition, the course has a methods component designed to teach  you  to think like a criminologist. With our MicroCase software, you will be able to to see the geographical variation in crime, understand cross tabulations, and examine correlates of crime .

##  Requirements  
  
---  
  
###  ![](redbulle.gif)**__Reading__**

  * George Cole and Christopher Smith , _[Criminal Justice in America](http://cj.wadsworth.com/cole_america/chapters/index.html)_ (West/Wadsworth Publishing) [click on title to get to web site that supports this text].
  * Steven Messner and Rodney Stark, _Criminology: An Introduction Using ExplorIt_ (MicroCase). This book include a diskette, CD rom, and instructions for installing it on your computer or a PC in one of the labs.

![](redbulle.gif)**__MicroCase Exercises (15% of course grade)__**  


> Three MicroCase exercises are requirements for this course. Assignments are
due in class on the day specified in the course outline. **The worksheet plus
all maps, graphs, or tables must be turned with your assignment.**

    * Worksheet Chapter 1 , _Stark & Messner chapter 1, Geographic variations in UCR_
    * [Web Worksheet-Attitudes Toward Police (click here to access) _,_](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~humphri/crosstabs.html) _Stark & Messner, chapter 5, Cross Tabulation_
    * _[Web worksheet-Size of Incarcerated Population (click here to access)](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~humphri/scatter.html), Stark_ _ & Messner, Chapter 6 Scatter Plots and Chapter 11 Correlation_

![](redbulle.gif)**__Multiple Choice Examinations (80% of course grade)__**

> Four multiple choice exams are given in this course. One on the introductory
material, one of the police, one of the courts, and one on corrections. The
exams are not cumulative. See web page on improving your performance on these
exams. Review the make up policy below.

![](redbulle.gif)**__Participation (5% of course grade)__**

> Classroom projects or activities occur throughout the semester.
Participation in these activities count toward participation points as do
insightful comments about the readings or current events.

  
![](redbulle.gif) **__Rules of the Road__**  


> **__Make Up Policy:__** If you have a conflict with exam or due dates,
please see me in advance to arrange to take the exam early or turn in an
exercise early. If you miss an exam or due date through no fault of your own,
you may be given the opportunity to make it up. Documentation is required.
Make up exams are scheduled to coincide with the fourth exam which will be
administered during the finals period.

> _**_Attendance Policy:  _** Excessive_absences usually result in lower
grades. Students who don't come to class will be poorly prepared for exams. In
addition, I take attendance from time to time, and I keep a record of
assignments as an additional basis for assigning classroom participation
points. Generally, speaking the student who establishes a consistent record of
attendance and participation gets the benefit of the doubt when it comes to
assigning course grades in boarder line cases.

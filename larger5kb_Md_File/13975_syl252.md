**Purpose of the Course:**  
History 252 focuses on women and gender in Europe from ancient times to the
present.  Researching women's history and including gender as a historical
construct not only help us preserve the distinctive contributions of women to
western civilization but also force us to rethink historical categories of
class, race, region, and periodization.  Indeed, historians Anderson and
Zinsser have argued that "gender has been the most important factor in shaping
the lives of European women" ( ** _A History of Their Own_** xv).

**Readings:**  
Bridenthal et al., **_Becoming Visible: Women in European History_** , 3rd
edition  
DiCaprio, **_Lives and Voices: Sources in European Women's History_**  
Watterson, **_Women in Ancient Egypt_**  
Woolf, **_A Room of One's Own_**  
WWW documents as indicated  
All readings are required and should be completed by the date indicated in the
syllabus.

**Class Participation and Attendance:**  
Much of the historical material on women is very provocative, and you will
want to discuss the individuals and ideas introduced in the text and readings.
You cannot do this if you are a) absent, b) asleep, or c) unprepared.
Completion of assignments and participation in discussion are important to the
success of the class (and your grade).  Quizzes will be given periodically to
encourage timely completion of reading assignments.  Since I drop the lowest
quiz/worksheet grade, there will be no make-ups for quizzes.  A doctor's
excuse is required to make up an exam. Students are encouraged to relate their
own research to topics covered in the lectures and readings and to present
portions of their work to the class.

**Collective Biography Project (cbp):**  
Each student will prepare a collective biography which profiles the life of a
woman from a specific racial/ethnic background, social status, time period,
and region.  The project is designed to familiarize students with the diverse
historical categories and sources which need to be considered to understand
the economic, social, political, and ideological factors which make the female
experience distinct.  As the descriptor "collective" suggests, the biography
will focus on a "generic" individual within a particular historical framework.

Students will examine the ways in which gender shapes the religious
experiences, family life, economic roles, and political and legal status of
their individuals.  Research findings will be presented to the class and
results turned in to the instructor in essay form.  Each essay should be
between three to five typewritten pages and will be due as follows:

 Family Life -- September 20  
 Religious experiences -- October 11  
 Economic roles -- November 1  
 Legal and Political Status -- November 15

These segments will be integrated into a final paper due 29 November.  The
collective biography should be between 12-20 typewritten pages with footnotes
or endnotes in the humanities format.  Criteria for content and format are
described in the [paper worksheet](252cbp.htm).

**Midterm Examination:**  
There will be a mid-term examination 25 September 2001.  The exam will include
identifications, short answers, and essays taken from the class discussions
and readings.

**Final Examination:**  
There will be a comprehensive final examination on 8 December 2001.  The exam
will include identifications, short answers, and essays taken from the class
discussions and readings.

**Grading:**  
Final grades will be calculated by averaging scores on the mid-term
examination (20 percent), collective biography project (40 percent--includes
grades on four topical essays and on the final paper), class participation and
attendance (20 percent--includes presentations of student research,
participation in discussions, quizzes and worksheets), and final examination
(20 percent). The following grading scale will be used:  90-100 = A; 86-89 =
B+; 80-85 = B; 76-79 = C+; 70-75 = C; 60-69 = D; 0-59 = F.

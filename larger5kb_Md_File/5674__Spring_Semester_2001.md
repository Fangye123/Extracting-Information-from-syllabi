##  **Focus and Goals of the Course:**

As the course title suggests, there are many varieties of feminist theory.
This semester we will sample a selection of  primarily Western feminist social
and political thinkers from the 19th century to the present.  Some of the
questions we will ask include:

  * How have the 19th century legacies of enlightenment, Marxist, and Freudian thought influenced the development of feminist theory?
  * Is it useful to make distinctions between the first and second wave theories? Between the second wave and an emergent third wave feminism?
  * As feminist theory in the academy becomes increasingly intellectually sophisticated and abstract, how can it remain useful in developing strategies for social change and providing insight into the daily life experience of diverse groups of women around the globe?
  * Are there too many varieties of feminist theory today?   Can theory help feminists of very different intellectual persuasions, not to mention differing  racial, ethnic, class, sexual,  national and religious identities find common ground for working together for change while recognizing and respecting their differences?

**Specific learning goals** are for students to become acquainted with a
variety of theorists; to become comfortable reading, discussing and critiquing
theoretical work; to acquire skills for analyzing theories; and to find ways
to apply the theories studied to current political conditions and life
situations.

##  **Course Requirements**

Class participation                  15%  
Short reaction papers             15%    (do 8 out of 12  1-2 pp. papers)  
First paper (due March 15)    25%   7-8 typed double-spaced pages  
In-class exam  (April 3)          20%  
Final paper (due May 8)        25%    7-8 typed double-spaced pages  


**Class participation** :    (15 points)

  * **You must earn the grade.**
  * If you are not in class, you can't very well contribute, so poor attendance hurts your class participation grade.   I am most likely to take attendance at the beginning of the term to learn names, on small group discussion days, and if I notice dwindling numbers.
  * Participation is more than just showing up.  It is contributing to the class, responding to other students, helping to keep discussion on track, demonstrating that you have come to class prepared, and most important, learning to articulate ideas, finding a voice and listening.
  * For occasional small group discussions (listed on syllabus) each person will, at least once, serve as a facilitator, oral reporter, or written reporter (to be explained more in class), which counts toward participation.

**Reaction Papers**   (15 points)

  * These are short -- 1-2 pages, preferably typed, double-spaced.
  * There are 12 assigned;  only 8 required.
  * The last one, #11-12 may count as two if it is 4 pages long.
  * If you do more than 8, only the 8 highest grades will count.
  * There are worth 2 pts. each, so if you get full credit on 8 you will end up with 1 pt. extra credit.  They will be graded "excellent" (2 pts.), good (1.75 pts.), partial credit (1 pt.) and 0 credit.
  * Most people will probably get "good" (1.75 or a B+) most of the time; "excellent" (A+) will be reserved for papers which demonstrate something extra special.
  * Late papers (on time for these means in class) have a 50% grade penalty!
  * If you are not in class to discuss the paper the day it is due, you may lose part credit.

  
Two reaction papers requiring attending something outside of class.  If these
are not convenient or of interest, there are 10 other choices, so plan
accordingly.

  * Reaction paper # 5 due Mar. 27 (instead of 3/1).  Go to the exhibit of Annie Leibovitz's photographs of women at the Corcoran Museum on your own (closes 3/28, $3. student admission). Write about your reactions to the exhibit, citing and discussing specific images and relating the images to Susan Sontag's essay for the exhibit (in the exhibit catalog at the museum) and/or to ch. 63(Kaplan, "Is the Gaze Male").  **Sontag's essay is now on Prometheus (for Mar. 27).**   _Inaddition_ to discussing the above reading(s), you might want to contrast Leibovitz's images of women to those in the Dreamworlds 2 video (showing class).

  * Reaction paper # 10 due  Apr. 17.  Attend the Women's Studies [public lecture](http://www.gwu.edu/~wstu/events/events.htm) by Cynthia Enloe on Mar. 30 ( PostHall, Mt. Vernon Campus, 7pm) and discuss your response to it.

  
---  
  
##  **First Paper  ** (25 points)

Select at least **three** theorists from the list below (through March 13 on
the syllabus) and use their theories, highlighting similarities and
differences among the theorists, to analyze **one** of the following:

(a) A current (including re-runs) television show, film, popular music lyrics,
or video;  
(b) A current issue in the news;  
(c) Media coverage of a current issue (that is, focus on how the media
portrays the issue whereas b, above, is on the substance of the issue);  
(d) A current women's or gender issue on campus or in your life.

Theorists/readings: hooks (6 + handout), Wollstonecraft (8), Taylor/Mill (12),
Cooper (16), Gilman (18), de Beauvoir (31), Radicalesbians (43), Firestone
(40), Hartman (63), Rubin (50), Combahee River Collective (54), Lorde (57),
Yamada (62), Chodorow (58), Gilligan (64), Williams (e-reserve), Kaplan (65),
Rich (60), MacKinnon (78), Daly (handout).

Grading Considerations for the Paper:

  * Due March 15, but there is a no-penalty grace period until 5 pm March 17 as long as you attended class on March 15.  (In other words, don't skip class to finish the paper.)
  * For late papers after March 17, an A becomes a B-, a B becomes a C-, etc.
  * Suggested length:  7-8 pages, must be typed and double-spaced
  * Careful proofreading, spell checking, etc. required.
  * Poor writing or poor organization will lead to a poor grade.
  * I will look for original, critical thinking, in depth analysis, demonstration of good grasp of the reading assignments discussed
  * Avoid unsupported generalizations, trite or superficial comments.
  * Full citation of **all** sources required, including course readings for this course
  * Your selection of   theorists and topic should fit well together to make a coherent paper.
  * How well you discuss the theories is the single most important factor for the grade.
  * If you don't follow instructions and your paper does not fit the specific requirements of this assignment, you will get a low grade -- possibly a failing grade.

**In-Class Exam**   April 3  (20 points)

  * Mostly identification of key concepts, different theorists' ideas through essays and some short answer questions.
  * Study guide will be distributed in advance.

#  **Final Paper**   (25 points)

  * Use at least 4 theorists we have read this semester to analyze and critique the representation in popular culture or any aspect of  the media (including news media) of women from some "nondominant" racial, ethnic, religious, class, sexual, or national group (where "non dominant" may mean non-white, non-Christian, non-heterosexual, poor, immigrant, foreign, poor/low-income, etc.).
  * At least 2 of your 4 theorists must be from assigned readings since the exam (after April 3 on the syllabus).
  * You may NOT use any of the same theorists/readings for the first and final papers unless they are extras, beyond your four main theorists, and you may not use the exact same topic (same film, TV show, etc.) as in the 1st paper.

  
Additional guidelines:

  * The **due date** has been changed to 5 pm Monday, **May 8** (instead of May 5)
  * Other examples of a "non dominant" group of women may be possible -- ask if you have questions
  * Many forms of popular culture and media are appropriate   \-- again, ask if you have questions
  * Suggested **length:   8 pages**; must be typed and double-spaced
  * Longer papers are permitted but 8 pages is fine;  quality is much more important than quantity
  * **The most important factor** in the grade is how well you discuss the theorists and apply them to your topic.
  * Careful proofreading, spell checking, etc. required.
  * Poor writing or poor organization will lead to a poor grade.
  * I will look for original, critical thinking, in depth analysis, demonstration of good grasp of the reading assignments discussed
  * Avoid unsupported generalizations, trite or superficial comments.
  * Full and proper citation of **all** sources required, including course readings for this course
  * Your selection of   theorists and topic should fit well together to make a coherent paper.
  * If you don't follow instructions and your paper does not fit the specific requirements of this assignment, you will get a low grade -- possibly a failing grade.
  * **Warning** , academic integrity means, among other things, that if the paper is not written in your own words you may be charged with plagiarism and receive an F.

  * Late final papers will receive an incomplete only with advance written permission (new University contract form).
  * Late final papers will receive a grade penalty (A becomes B etc.)
  * Late final papers without written permission and a contract for an incomplete will receive a zero.

##  **Academic Integrity and Plagiarism**

* Students are expected to adhere to the University Academic Integrity Code.
* Be careful to be sure to fully cite all sources.
* Ask for help and/or consult a style manual if you are not sure how, when, or   whether to include a citation.
* **All papers must be written in your own words**.
* Papers that fail to address the specific topics and questions assigned for this class risk an F.

This course is a survey of modern Japanese history. It covers the period from
the founding of the Tokugawa shogunate to the present day. The focus is on the
interconnections between political, social, and intellectual history during
Japan's emergence as a world power.

This is a survey course that makes use of various methods to help you acquire
knowledge of modern Japanese history. In addition to lectures, there are
periodic discussions of assigned readings and films. Because I believe firmly
that writing sharpens our thinking and ability to analyze complex phenomena,
there is also a required research paper. There will also be an in-class
midterm and a final examination. Periodic quizzes will help you gauge your
mastery of the material. In addition to the regularly scheduled classes, **you
are required to attend a screening of a feature length film**. The times and
places will be announced well in advance.  
  
**Grading policies:**  
Please note the following policies:  

  1. Letter grades are assigned according to the following scale: A=93-100, A-=90-92, B+=87-89, B=83-86, B-=80-82, C+=77-79, C=73-76, C-=70-72, D+=67-69, D=63-66, D-=60-62, E=less than 60. Please note that work never turned in counts as a zero (0).  

  2. Late papers lose one grade step for each day late (thus a B+ that is two days late receives a B-).  

  3. I do not give make-up quizzes unless you have an acceptable and documented excuse (for example, a medical excuse signed by a physician).  

  4. I will not consider requests for incompletes without a clearly documented and acceptable reason.  

  5. Plagiarism is taking (which includes purchasing) the words or ideas of another and passing them off as one's own work. If in a formal paper a student quotes someone, that student must use quotation marks and give a citation. Paraphrased or borrowed ideas are to be identified by proper citations. Plagiarism will result, at the minimum, in a zero (0) for the assignment.

**GROUP I  
Nationalism, Globalization and Urban Space

**

In this course, we will consider the multiple--often complementary, sometimes
conflicting--ways that nationalist ideology and forces of globalization work
to shape urban space.   Our focus will be on representations in novels, films,
and academic commentary of five cities--Los Angeles, Belfast, Beirut, Tokyo,
and Honolulu.  We will explore how these cities have come to represent
important issues in their nations imaginary and the role that they play in the
global economy.  For instance, we will think about the way in which following
the Rodney King beating, L. A. has become emblematic of race relations in the
United States. Often viewed as the West Coast capital of the U. S., L. A.
includes a range of cultural mixes and problems (environmental and sweat shop
labor to name but two) that characterize global flows.  We will think through
how other cities, like Beirut and Belfast, long important in nationalist
struggles must now work to define their place in the global economy.  What
does such a transition entail, and how does it shape both representations of
those cities as well as things like urban planning?  We will look at
representations of Honolulu that work to counter the image of Hawaii as
paradise at the same time as they show the effects of colonialism and
immigration on the city and its inhabitants.

Requirements: One short presentation with 5 page paper on one of the cities
under discussion. One research paper on the representations of a city of the
students choosing in relation to nationalism and globalization. Weekly email

GROUP II  
History of Science and the Novel** **  
  
CONCEPT**.   There are many ways to learn about history other than by reading
history textbooks.  Many of us have picked up much of our working knowledge of
history from parental comments or traditions, from movies or TV programs, or
by reading historical novels.  The proposed course seeks to teach one
particular branch of history--the history of science--through reading and
discussing novels about the history of science.  Increasing numbers of recent
novels in the history of science--a genre dubbed "science _in_ fiction " by
the chemist-turned-novelist Carl Djerassi--now make such a course not only
possible but desirable.

**

SCOPE**. No course can begin to cover the entire scope of scientific history--
from pyramid construction to quantum mechanics, the Mayan calendar to the Mir
space station--in a single semester. The proposed course would focus on
Atlantic civilization in the period from the 17th to the mid-20th Century.

**

STUDENT GOALS**.

  1. To acquire a working knowledge of the leading events in the history of the natural sciences, from the Scientific Revolution to the 20th Century; 
  2. To examine how, and how _well,_ these events can be portrayed in fiction, by reading a number of novels; to explore the boundary between historical fact and historical fiction; 
  3. To determine how effective the "science in fiction" genre is for learning about the history of science 
  4. To experiment individually with the process of writing "science in fiction."

**

CLASS SESSIONS**. Class sessions will emphasize the discussion of novels read
jointly by the class. During the latter half of each session, I will lecture
on the scientific/historical background to the following week's reading.
Students will be responsible for leading one discussion, and also will share
the results of their writing efforts (described below).

**

TEXTS**. To be drawn from the attached bibliography.

  1. **REQUIREMENTS--GRADING**.  
Advance preparation of reading for active participation in class discussions.

  2. Leadership of one discussion session. 
  3. 20 pp of writing, consisting of (a) a short piece of "science in fiction" (e.g., 'creative writing' of a short story), _or_ , (b) essay reviews of two works not covered in class. 
  4. Oral presentation of completed writings for class critique. 

**

INSTRUCTOR'S QUALIFICATIONS**. I have been teaching History of Science courses
at Manoa since 1975 and have written and/or edited four books and numerous
articles. Since 19971 have been writing an epistolary novel about science in
Victorian Britain, emphasizing the events surrounding the Darwinian
Revolution. I have given public talks on the writing of science history novels
in Leeds and Cambridge, England, and at Manoa and on Kauai. The attached
bibliography represents much of the reading I have done to prepare for this
project

GROUP III  
Perspectives on Law

**

This seminar will examine the various roles performed by institutions of law
(e.g. the maintenance of social harmony, the underwriting of agreements, the
creation of opportunities) and will do so from a variety of disciplinary
perspectives (philosophy, sociology, politics, literature). It will attempt to
demonstrate how much we can learn about our own culture and that of other
societies (both historical and contemporary) by studying legal institutions
and practices.   Throughout the semester we will be looking at possible topics
for honors dissertations that can be undertaken in any discipline that makes
contact with the law--which is virtually every discipline.

Topics to be covered:

The following list may be modified in the light special interests that
students bring to the course.  Students with special interests (e.g.
environmental law, international law) not covered on the following provisional
syllabus should contact the instructor as soon as they are certain they will
enroll in the course.

Week 1: Legal Reasoning: Formalism, (American Legal)         Realism,
Dworkin's 'Law as Integrity'

Week 2: Jurisprudence: positivism; natural law; economic, race and feminist
criticism

Week 3: Sociology of Law: contributions of Max Weber and George Gurvitch

Week 4: Anglo-American Common Law vs. Continental European Civil Law
traditions

Week 5: Archaic and Non-Western law: early Greek, native American, Islamic and
Chinese

Week 6: The Law and Literature Movement: guilt and confession, neo-pragmatism

Week 7: Torts & Delicts: causation and responsibility, compensation, duties to
strangers

Week 8: Criminal Law: enforcement of morals, _mens rea,_ insanity pleas

Week 9: Property: analysis of the concept, intellectual property, property in
Asian traditions

Week 10: Contracts: enforcement of promises, unconscionability, surrogate
motherhood

Week 11: Constitutional Law I: legal hermeneutics, free speech & pornography

Week 12: Constitutional Law II: privacy in the U.S., rights in China, justice
in India

Week 13: Family Law: lesbian and gay families, _sati_ in India, unwed fathers

Week 14: Employment law: affirmative action, sexual harassment, virtual
slavery

Week 15: Punishment: capital punishment; alternative sanctions; clemency,
equity and mercy

Week 16: Legal Ethics: lawyer-client relations, conflicts of interest,
professional standards

Students will be expected to write two ten-page papers (that will involve
finding additional resources in the Hamilton and Law School libraries) as well
as weekly ungraded summaries of portions of the assigned reading that will
serve as the bases for introducing discussion.

The seminar will be based primarily on a reader,

_Legal Philosophy: Multiple Perspectives, _ edited by May, Snow  & Bolte
(Mayfield, 2000)  
and will be supplemented by a course packet,

_

Further Perspectives on Law,  
_which will provide material on sociology of law, comparative law and the
recent fashion for studies in law and literature. This course packet will in
some cases supplement topics covered in the reader with additional sources and
court reports.

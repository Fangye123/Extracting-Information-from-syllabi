Written Exercises for History 2020

The syllabus for this course indicates that 20% of your grade
will depend upon classroom participation. Part of it (11 points)
will be determined by your attendance and actual participation in
classroom discussion. Another part of it (9 points) will be
determined by written exercises based on Discovering the
American Past: A Look at the Evidence, volume II, 5th
edition, by William Bruce Wheeler and Susan D. Becker. 

(This is
the book used in classroom discussion and is referred to in the
assignments in the syllabus as READINGS.)
Each exercise will normally be due two class meetings after the
readings selection is scheduled for discussion in the classroom;
because
the 2002 term is a day shorter than usual, toward the end of the term
some of the exercises will be due at the next class meeting instead.
It will count only 1/2 point if submitted later than the due date
(see the course syllabus for these dates). Your instructor will
keep all the exercises on file until the course has been
completed.

**Technology and Change :  
Technologies and their Societies**

  
  
_Course description_ : A historical perspective on the role that technology
has played in modern history. While the primary focus of this course is on the
relation of technology to American culture after the Revolutionary War, we
will also examine the role of technologies and technological systems in other
places and times, including European society during the Middle Ages and in the
Soviet Union. An underlying assumption of this course is that technology is
simultaneously a reflection of social and cultural values, and one factor
(only one among many) that shape the continuous development and transformation
of those values.  
  
A comprehensive survey of all technological developments since the
Revolutionary War cannot be achieved in a single quarter. In this course, we
will concentrate on a number of themes and issues, including the emergence of
industrial towns in nineteenth century America, the relation of science to the
military, the role of experts in designing technological systems, the
development of the computer, and the relation of technology to the
environment.  
  
_Required texts_ (all paperback, available at the Memorial Union bookstore):  
  
Loren R. Graham, _The Ghost of the Executed Engineer: Technology and the Fall
of the Soviet Union_  
Brooke Hindle and Steven Lubar, _Engines of Change: The American Industrial
Revolution, 1790-1860_  
Thomas P. Hughes, _American Genesis: A Century of Invention and Technological
Enthusiasm, 1870-1970_  
Tracy Kidder, _The Soul of the New Machine_. (any edition)  
Arnold Pacey, _The Maze of Ingenuity: Ideas and Idealism in the Development of
Technology_ (second edition)  
  
_Recommended text_ :

Alain Erlande-Brandenburg, _Cathedrals and Castles: Building in the Middle
Ages_  
Jules R. Benjamin, _A Student's Guide to History_  
  
Additional readings will be available for check-out at [Circulation/Reserves
of Valley
Library](http://oasis.orst.edu/search/rHsts421/rhsts421/-6,0,0,B/frameset&F=rhsts+421&1,1)
[second floor; request the course packet].  
  
Copies of required books also will be available at the Reserve Desk.  
  
_Course Requirements_ : Three papers, on topics to be assigned, two of roughly
1000 words each [4 double-spaced pages, in standard type, due on **Jan. 31st**
and **February 26th** ], an essay of circa 2000 words, in place of a final
examination, due at **4 PM** on **Monday, March 18th** , and occasional short
assignments. The first two essays each contribute 20 percent towards the final
grade; the final essay 40 comprises percent. Regular attendance is expected;
participation in class discussions and related activities [including
Blackboard discussion forums] constitutes the final 20 percent of the grade
for this course.  
  
Graduate students enrolled in HSTS 521 should ensure that their seminar
research papers are consistent with graduate school standards. A separate
graduate seminar (approximately one hour per week) will be arranged to
facilitate discussion.  
  
Students are expected to be honest and ethical in their academic work.
Academic dishonesty is defined as an intentional act of deception in one of
the following areas: cheating-- use or attempted use of unauthorized
materials, information or study aids; fabrication-- falsification or invention
of any information; assisting-- helping another commit an act of academic
dishonesty; tampering-- altering or interfering with evaluation instruments
and documents; and plagiarism--representing the words or ideas of another
person as one's own.  
  
All seminar members are to enroll in the Blackboard site for this class (which
also allow for on-line discussion and debate among students, access to course
documents, and participation in group projects). Log on at
[http://my.oregonstate.edu](http://my.oregonstate.edu); see
[FAQ](http://my.oregonstate.edu/Blackboard_FAQ.htm) at this site for further
instructions. Students are expected to have an active email account as well
(any account is fine) _but be sure mail is forwarded from your ONID accounts_!
To forward email, [ logon to your ONID account](https://onid.orst.edu/cgi-
bin/my?type=want_auth), then click on the 'Change email forward' link in the

Course Description and Objectives  
The second in a four-course sequence in Western Civilization, this course is
an introduction to the history of Europe and European Empires during the early
modern period. The purpose of the Western Civilization sequence is to provide
students of history and the liberal arts with a solid foundation in the
principal ideas, institutions, and events that have shaped Western
civilization. It seeks to promote an understanding of historical context and
perspective and to encourage the skills essential to historical inquiry,
including the capacity to define historical questions, analyze primary
documents, evaluate alternative interpretations, develop coherent arguments,
and write clearly and effectively.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  
  

Exams will consist of short-answer questions and large essay questions. Each
of the three exams will cover roughly one-third of the course; the third exam
will also include a comprehensive section.

2\. A Research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 20%
for the second)  
  

The research paper can be on any topic in Western Civilization during the
early modern era. Papers are to be analytical and interpretive; they should
present a thesis and develop an argument. You are encouraged to use primary
sources, and you are expected to examine the historiographical context of your
topic. First drafts may be limited to sources available in the Duggan Library,
but you are expected to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional sources for
the final draft. You should include with your first draft a bibliography based
on a universal search for sources. The grade of each draft will be based on
the quality of the thesis and argument, the quality of the evidence and logic,
and the quality of the writing. The grade of the second draft will also
reflect the improvement (or lack of improvement) shown between the first and
second draft. You should consult with me about your paper at least a week
before each draft is due.

3\. Class participation and daily writing assignments (15%)  
  

As a small seminar, the success of this class depends upon the quality of the
dialogue in class. It is expected that you will attend every class and that
you will be fully prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day.
Class participation grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency
of your contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

Each of you will submit a short writing assignment by 10 a.m. on class days.
You are to write one or two paragraphs (but not more than one page)
summarizing the most significant or revealing points in the day's readings.
You are also to articulate questions you have of the material, including at
least one substantive, open-ended question that lends itself to different
interpretations and could serve as the basis of a discussion. The assignments
are to be type-written and may be submitted through email or placed in my
mailbox.

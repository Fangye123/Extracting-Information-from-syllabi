for the good of the Battalion. Cadets receiving a positive "Spot Report" will
receive 5 points added to their grade per "Spot Report" up to a maximum of 20
points. Conversely, negative "Spot Report" will result in a loss of 5 points
per card with total maximum point deduction of 20 points from your final grade

c. Special and Additional Requirements:  
  
(1) All MS I cadets must participate in at least one PT session per week on
Friday morning. Cadet PT sessions occur every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
from 0715 to 0830. Cadre members conduct PT every Tuesday and Thursday and
cadets are also invited to participate. Cadets that cannot attend the required
Friday PT session for a given week must coordinate with the instructor for an
alternate day to receive credit. Ensure that you aggressively seek out and
sign the attendance roster at PT sessions to receive credit.  
  
(2) Battle Dress Uniforms (BDU) must be worn to leadership laboratories and as
directed by the training schedule. BDU's will be worn to regular scheduled
classes. Check the attached training schedules for additional uniform
requirements.  
  
(3) Attendance translates to points for your overall grade. If you cannot
attend a graded event outside the classroom (i.e. Lab, FTX or LTX) you need to
see me prior to the training event. With proper notification, an alternate
means of making up the missed events or activities may be arranged at the
discretion of the instructor. Failure to comply with this policy will result
in zero points for the event or activity in the final grade computation. You
may contact me via phone, e-mail, or stop by my office at the Department of
Military Education. You are responsible for obtaining notes and/or handouts
from missed classes.  
  
(4) Training missed due to an Army or ROTC event will receive full credit as
long as it is coordinated in advance with the instructor. Training missed due
to injury or severe illness requires a note from your doctor with the
limitations of your activity. This included physical training. An alternate
means of making up missed events or activities may be arranged at the
discretion of the instructor. You are responsible for obtaining notes and/or
handouts from missed classes.

9\. Standards for Writing Assignment:  
You will write a typed report defining leadership (in your opinion) and
describing your leadership style. A Separate handout with specific details
will be given to you during the first day of class defining the requirements
for the report.

10\. Standards for Oral Presentation: The oral presentations should be between
10-15 minutes long. The presentations will consist of teams with no less than
3 and no more than 5 people. Any presentation not lasting 10 minutes or
exceeding 15 minutes will receive point deductions. Briefers are to prepare
and/or utilize visual aids. Groups may choose their own topic with the
approval of the instructor. Grading criteria will be covered in detail during
class. A spreadsheet will be available to sign up for your presentation topic,
date, and time. There will be no presentations briefed beyond the prescribed
dates.

11\. Cadet Administration: It is each cadet's individual responsibility to
provide personal information to the battalion administrative section in
accordance with the specified program regulations. The following list contains
some of the more critical information that must be provided to the ROTC
Department. The list also contains items that could bar you from enrollment,
require a waiver, or result in future disqualification from the program:  
(1) Alien status;  
(2) Academic major/minor and/or any changes;  
(3) Marital status;  
(4) Address and phone number and any changes if applicable;  
(5) Change of graduation date;  
(6) Any recent civil or criminal convictions;

(11) Meet certain body fat composition standards and physical fitness
requirements;  
(12) Registered for the appropriate lab periods for every semester of ROTC
taken.  

12\. Cadet Professional Development Training (CPDT). Only cadets that have

  |  **Course Description:**  
This course presents a survey of European prehistory through the study of
archaeological remains from the Paleolithic period until the Roman conquest.
The coverage will be selective because of the temporal and geographic
variability of Europe. Several significant themes will be emphasized and
important sites from the various selected regions will be discussed, centering
primarily on west-central Europe. The relationship between the various kinds
of archaeological evidence will provide the background for the discussion. The
distribution of sites in the landscape, evidence for subsistence and
production, changes in mortuary ritual through time and the way in which
ideology is mapped onto material culture and the built environment are
components of the way prehistoric European social evolution is interpreted.
The course is intended to introduce students to the archaeological evidence
for the early development of what eventually become the various nation-states
of modern Europe. In the process European cultural evolution is compared to
other parts of the Old World, and placed in the context of increasing social
complexity world-wide and its implications for the future of our species.
Format will be lecture/discussion, with slides, films and Web resources.

  |  **Oral Presentation Guidelines and Topics**  
  
Presentation groups will be **assigned** with up to 6 members per group. Each
group member will research a different aspect of the topic, **to be determined
by the group** , and will prepare a one-page summary of their findings. These
will be turned in to me on the day of the presentation. **One** individual
from each group will be designated the group spokesperson. The group will meet
**at least one week** before the presentation date in order to work out the
**15 minute presentation** the spokesperson will present to the class. The
entire group will sit with the spokesperson as a panel, and following the
presentation, will take questions from the class for an additional 10 minutes.
The entire presentation is to take **no more than 30 minutes**. The grade will
be determined on the following basis:  
  
Timing and Fluency: 5%  
Content (Accuracy and Comprehensiveness): 5%  
One-page Summaries: 5%  
  
Each one-page summary must include the following:  

  1. Title/Name of Group Member  

  2. Bibliography listing all sources used or cited  

  3. Bibliography **must** include at least **two** sources not included in class reading  

  4. Refer to attached guideline for short papers for in-text citation format and sample bibliographic entries  

A handout must be produced by the group for distribution to the class on the
day of the presentation. The handout should include the following:  

  1. Outline of presentation topics, with names of presenters  

  2. List of terms associated with the topic, with short definitions  

  3. Comprehensive bibliography of all references cited by group members  

You are encouraged to make use of visuals on the form of overheads or slides
in the group presentations. Overheads listing topics covered point by point
can help organize the presentation and can be used as a guide for the
spokesperson.  
  
**Goals** : Demonstrate 1) ability to research a topic successfully and 2)
reduce it to its essential points in order to 3) present it in oral form
coherently enough that each member of the audience is theoretically able to
reiterate at least one salient point after the presentation is over and 4) to
field questions related to the topic in an intelligent and informed manner.  
  
**All class members will be required to produce a one-page paper in which the
essential points of the presentation are summarized and a brief critique is
provided! You will have ten minutes following the group presentation to
complete this paper. These will be used in my evaluation of the group
presentation, and group members will receive copies the following week.**

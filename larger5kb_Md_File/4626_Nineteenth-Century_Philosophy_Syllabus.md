## Course Design

The nineteenth century witnessed the high water mark of philosophical system-
building, but also its subsequent erosion and redirection. This course focuses
upon five influential movements of the era: idealism, empiricism, Marxism,
existentialistic romanticism, and pragmatism. We will examine the philosophies
of eleven seminal figures: Schelling, Fichte, Hegel, Comte, Mill, Marx,
Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Peirce, James, and Dewey. Without doubt Hegel casts
the longest shadow across the century, and we'll read Robert Pippin's _Hegel's
Idealism_ in order to approach this profound yet daunting philosopher. We'll
also note Hegel's influence upon later philosophers, especially Marx,
Kierkegaard, and Dewey--philosophers who built significant bridges to
twentieth century thought.

## Grading

This is a writing intensive course. As such, a significant part of your
overall grade is divided between small writing assignments (micros) designed
to help you prepare for major writing assignments (macros). Keep on top of
these projects! All work not submitted by the stated deadline must be assessed
one full letter grade per day late.

Here are your assigned micros and macros:

weight| assignment| topic  
  
---|---|---  
5%| Micro 1 | web page and resource source familiarity  
  
5%| Micro 2 | paper topic and abstract I  
  
(ungraded)| Macro 1 | 5-7 page paper I  
  
5%| Micro 3 | returned comments page with proposed corrections  
  
20%| Macro 2 | revised original paper  
  
5%| Micro 4 | paper topic and abstract II  
  
20%| Macro 3 | 5-7 page paper II  
  
  
### Additional Requirements

weight| how assessed  
---|---  
15%| determined by a midterm exam, primarily objective and short answer  
  
20%| determined by a final exam primarily objective and short answer; the
final will cover material from the second half of the course only  
  
5%| is an attendance grade, assigned on the basis of a curve where the top 20%
receive 'A', the second 20% receive 'B', etc. Three instances of tardiness
count as one absence.  
  
  
_Note: Students who ask questions and regularly participate in class
discussions will receive 1-2 points added to their overall grade._

## Attendance Policy

I am generally happy to excuse absences for legitimate reasons when I receive
prior or same-day notification. A post to my e-mail address is ideal, but
phone calls are also acceptable (try to call during office hours, if
possible). Otherwise, written documentation from a recognized source is
required in order to excuse an absence.

## Expectations

Because the study of philosophy is most beneficial when personal insights
supplement a conceptual understanding of the material, regular attendance and
active involvement in class discussions are important. Please avoid tardiness,
which may disrupt the continuity and lectures and discussions. Ask questions
in class or consult your instructor about any concepts or arguments you do not
fully understand.

## Academic Honesty

Cheating and plagiarism are serious academic offenses that will not be
tolerated. University Policy 3342-3-07, section D, provides penalties
including but not limited to (1) assigning a zero grade for the work in which
the cheating or plagiarism took place or (2) assigning a grade of "F" in the
course. Please consult University Policy 3342-3-07, included in the KSU
Telephone Directory, for additional information.

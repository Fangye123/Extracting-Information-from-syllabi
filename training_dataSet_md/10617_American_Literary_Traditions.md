**Abstract**

This course will examine several works of American fiction as they have shaped
and been shaped by some of the most important literary traditions in the
United States. This course is not a "survey" course, but it is intended to be
an introductory course for the study of the multiple literatures of the United
States. Our focus will be primarily how the aesthetic, rhetorical, formal, and
cultural dimensions of the works are expressive of a variety of shared themes
such as human and cultural memory, the meaning of national history, cultural
and social construction of self-identity, and dramas of racial difference. The
course will meet one day a week in a conventional classroom and one day a week
in a networked computer classroom, where we will learn to use a variety of
electronic tools for analyzing and seeing these literary texts in new ways, as
well as writing about them in nontraditional, multimedia formats. (return to

ACADEMIC HONOR CODE: Students should be familiar with the GU honor code and
are reminded that rules for plagiarism and other honor violations apply as
rigorously to electronic work as printed work.

FOURTH CREDIT OPTION: Students who are engaged in community service are
encouraged to make connections between their work and the many possible
connections in this course, either in conversation or through their hypertext
projects. I encourage students who are interested in the fourth credit option
for applying their service work to learning to speak to me early in the
semester to make arrangements for it. (return to top)

####  Student Responsibilities:

Students are expected to attend class, keep up with the reading, and actively
share in the responsibility for making knowledge in the course. Student
participation in class, engagement with the materials, preparedness with
reading questions and passages, participation in the course's electronic
activities, including all electronic classroom activities will weigh
significantly in the grading. Student responsibilities fall into three
categories:

**Reading Questions:** Each week, the reading will be accompanied by reading
questions, which will be distributed variously by paper, the Web site, and the
listserv. You are responsible for being prepared on the reading questions
(never more than 1 or 2 at a time). Sometimes, instead of specific questions,
I will ask you simply to prepare a passage that you felt was important, for
which you can identify key themes, issues, and connections. Sometimes you will
be asked to write on a reading question when you come into class; sometimes I
will use the reading questions as the basis for class discussion and call on
you to speak to the questions for a minute or two; othertimes the reading
questions might guide or inform our work with electronic texts and Internet
archival work. The Reading Questions are not optional guides for the reading,
but a critical component of the course.  

**Hypertext Journals:** Every Wednesday we will be in Reiss 282, doing
electronic work with electronic texts and resources. Most of these activities
will be done in pairs, or groups, and will involve writing research and
synthesis reflections in a Web- journal. You will use Netscape's text editor
as your hypertext writing environment, enabling you to make direct electronic
links to outside resources, as well as linkages to other students' work.  

**Analysis Paper:** One third of the way through the course, there will be a
traditional analysis paper, related to Twain, Morrison, and all other readings
thus far. This paper can be built on and transformed in the next hypertext
project.  

**Hypertext Projects ("papers"):** There are two hypertext "papers" in this
class, in the form of hypertext writing projects. I make no assumptions about
technical skills so you will get training and help to write your hypertext
projects. You will also be assigned to a "writing group" so that you can count
on a few others for feedback and mutual assistance. The two hypertext projects
will come at the two-thirds point and end of the semester. Much more
information will follow about these.

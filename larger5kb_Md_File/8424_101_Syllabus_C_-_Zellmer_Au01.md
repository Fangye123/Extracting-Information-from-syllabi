### General Information

**ENROLLMENT:** There are twenty-five work stations in a general chemistry
[laboratory room](/rmaps/clabmap.htm) which limits the size of a lab section.
Locker assignments are given at the first laboratory period. If a student
cannot attend the first lab or gets into a section after the lab has met, the
student should immediately go to [100 Celeste](/rmaps/c100map.htm) to get a
locker card for that section. During the first week of the quarter, enrollment
is determined by the [registrar](http://www.ureg.ohio-
state.edu/ourweb/online.html) and all adds or changes are done through BRUTUS
or the [web](https://www3.ureg.ohio-state.edu/secure/registration) as [space
permits](https://www3.ureg.ohio-state.edu/crsavail/). After the first week,
students should go to 100 Celeste to add or change a section if space allows.
Since a student is not officially enrolled in a chemistry course until they
have a locker assignment, failure to attend the first laboratory class may
result in disenrollment.

**STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY:** Each student receives this information about
Chemistry 101 in the first lecture section. It is your responsibility to read
this material and be familiar with course content, course procedures, and
grading. You are also responsible for any announcements concerning course
procedures which are made in class, whether you are present or not! (If you
are absent, you are expected to get notes, announcements, etc. from another
student in the class.)

**ADDITIONAL HELP:**

  1. Extra copies of course handouts are available in the General Chemistry Office, [100 Celeste Lab](/rmaps/c100map.htm).

  2. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the [Learning Resource Center (160 CE)](/rmaps/c100map.htm) frequently. Teaching assistants hold [Office Hours](aidtime.htm) there and will help with lab questions, homework, and preparation for quizzes and exams.

  3. Lab Supervisor - [Dr. Tatz](http://amichemii.mps.ohio-state.edu) ([email: Tatz.1@osu.edu](mailto:Tatz.1@osu.edu), 292-8096, [144 Celeste](/rmaps/c144map.htm)) will help you in problems concerning lab such as attendance, completion of labs, and grading of reports.

  4. All students with documented disabilities, who need accommodations, should see the instructor privately to schedule an appointment as early as possible. If your disability requires materials in alternative formats, please contact the Office for Disability Services at 292-3307, Room 150 Pomerene Hall.

**RETURN OF GRADED QUIZZES AND LAB REPORTS:** Your TAs have been asked to
return graded assignments one week after you have turned them in. Please
report deviations from this procedure promptly. Do not wait until the end of
the quarter to report ungraded assignments because, by then some TAs graduate
or are otherwise unavailable.  
  
**HOMEWORK:** Assignments are at the end of the page of this syllabus.
Homework will not be graded; however, doing assigned problems is often the
best way to determine how well you understand the material. Notes and homework
solutions can be found on the web or purchased at COP-EZ at Tuttle Park Place,
and will be posted in Celeste Lab 2nd floor.

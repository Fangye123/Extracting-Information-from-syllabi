**_Course Rationale:_**   222 surveys British literature from the early 19th
century through the late 20th century.  While we cannot possibly do an
exhaustive job of treating the three major literary genres (we do some justice
to the novel and poetry but very little to drama), we will be discussing at
least some representative works from each of the major movements and periods.
Because this is a survey course, it makes no pretense to thematic unity.
Rather, some lectures will touch on the broad spectrum of literary,
historical, and intellectual issues out of which this literature emerged;
others will zoom in on the literary works under discussion for the week.  

* * *

  **_Requirements:_**   There are two major requirements comprising 80% of
your grade:  **one 5-7 page critical essay (40%)** , due at the middle of the
term, and **another 5-7 page critical essay (40%)**, which is due on the final
day of class. You will have the option to revise the first paper to improve
your grade. In addition, I will give occasional quizzes on the novels and a
grade for class participation (cumulative 20%).  Topics for the critical
papers will be distributed in class (and made available on this website) 2
weeks before the paper is due.  Attendance at all lectures and active
participation in class discussions are absolutely essential to success in this
course.  Please take comprehensive notes on your reading and have all reading
assignments completed by the day on which they are due to be discussed.    One
of the purposes of this online syllabus is to point you toward websites which
provide additional information about writers, about writing essays, and about
literary theory. I also encourage you to email me with questions about paper
topics. If you have questions about getting started on a paper, you can help
me help you by providing me with a thesis paragraph and asking me to respond
to it. General grading guidelines for the critical papers can be found
[here](http://www.public.asu.edu/~dbivona/papers.html).   **N.B. I expect that
your papers will conform to ASU guidelines on academic honesty. That is, I
expect that all work is your own except for that which you have explicitly
cited on your "Works Cited" page. This means you must cite ideas and words
borrowed from online sources as well as from books and articles found in the
library. If you have further questions about this policy, see the statement
issued by the Women's Studies Program
[here](http://www.asu.edu/clas/womens_studies/honest.htm). It provides a
succinct summary of the policy in effect in this class.** **

****_Sources of Information:_**   If you are interested in a readable
introduction to basic theoretical issues, start by taking a look at [John
Lye's Literary Theory: An
Introduction](http://www.uwm.edu/people/jat/THEORY.HTM) and the [Glossary of
Literary
Theory.](http://dev.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/headerindex.html) For
links to sites that offer help with rhetorical terms or with mythological
background, see [Starting Point for Literary
Research.](http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~angela/literary.html) Essays written for
this class should conform to the conventions set out in the [MLA Format and
Citation Guide.](http://atl46.atl.msu.edu/fall/citation.html) You may find it
useful to consult a writing handbook. The following three are currently
available on the Web: [Elements of
Style,](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/) [Online English
Grammar,](http://www.edunet.com/english/grammar/) and [Able Writer: A Rhetoric
and Handbook.](http://www.odu.edu/~jpb/ablewriter.html) You should also make
use of a dictionary such as the [WWWebster
Dictionary.](http://www.m-w.com/dictionary)   You should be familiar with the
website for [ASU's Hayden Library.](http://www.asu.edu/lib/)  For useful
general sources of information about literary topics consult the following:
[Literary Resources Page,
](http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/Lit/)[Encyclopedia Britannica (ASU
only),](http://www.eb.com:180/) and [Voice of the
Shuttle.](http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/) For online literary texts try these
sites: [Modern English
Collection](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/modeng.browse.html), [The Online
Books Page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html), and [Literature Online
(Chadwyck-Healey; ASU only).](http://lion.chadwyck.com/)  The latter database
is also useful for keyword, phrase, and line searches of British and American
poetry, British drama, and some fiction (the online fiction collection of this
database is presently rather small).  You may also find the [British History
Timeline](http://www.britannia.com/history/time1.html) a useful source of
historical background information as well as the [Encyclopedia of British
History, 1700-1930](http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Britain.html).  While
there is not much online literary criticism currently available, you may find
the  [IPL Online Literary Criticism](http://www.ipl.org/ref/litcrit/) site,
[Literary Criticism on the
Web](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Crete/9078/index.html), and [Project
MUSE](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/) useful (the latter has full-text articles
from such important literary journals as _New Literary History, ELH,_ and
_Modern Fiction Studies)_. For a more extensive list of useful online sources,
see the  "links" frame on [my home
page](http://www.public.asu.edu/~dbivona/index.html).

###  Course Description

This course surveys the literary interaction of African Americans and
Russians, focusing on the black intellectual's experience with the emerging
Soviet state. Course materials will focus on autobiographical accounts of the
African-American experience in the United States and Soviet Russia.

###  "Framing the Questions"

This course is designed as an exploration of the topic "African- American
Literary Ties to Russia in the Twentieth Century." The task is to broaden our
understanding of the meeting of African-American and Russian experiences in
the 20th c. as well as to look back at all that has led up to it. Our focus,
the first half of the twentieth century, is a time period that brought
enormous changes for Russia, saw the emergence of the Soviet Union, and
brought African-Americans and Russians into closer contact.

There are general questions that students often bring up. Do blacks live in
Russia? Since when? Where? There are historical questions that need to be
answered. What was happening in Russian and US history prior to the 20th c.
that impacts our topic? What were these countries' roles in events in Europe's
history? We will try to answer some of these in the broadest manner to set the
stage for our discussion, in other words, to "frame our questions." Then we
will examine the literary works for the clues to more complete answers about
ties in the twentieth century.

I would encourage you to join me in the search for more material to be
included in this exploration. The materials presented here merely scratch the
surface and represent my interests in Russian literature and my attempts to
make Russia -- its literature, culture, history and language -- relevant for
my American students. This course has its beginnings at another North Carolina
university, [NC Agricultural and Technical State
University](http://www.ncat.edu/) (NCA&T), a historically black university in
[Greensboro, NC](http://www.greensboro.com/). At that time, NCA&T was trying
to bring Russian language and culture into the foreign language curriculum.

As with any literary study, our course will be what we make it. My  
students' contributions have shaped the material to date, as will your  
contributions. Each of us brings a personal and cultural history to the
discussion; each of us learns something from the discussion. This course is a
work in progress, and each of you will be a contributor.

###  Texts/Readings

Many of the works for this course are autobiographical. As you read, ask
yourself:  
1\. What is autobiography?  
2\. Why does an author write an autobiography?  
3\. Are all autobiographies the same? Why or why not? How do they differ?  
4\. What literary forms lend themselves to presentation of autobiography? Can
a poem be an autobiography?  
5\. Who is the author's intended audience?  
6\. What point of view is the author trying to present?  
7\. What is the danger in using fiction which incorporates autobiographical
detail to discuss an author's views?  
8\. What is the danger in using literature to discuss social/cultural history?

###  Study Modules/Grading & Evaluation

Because the course will involve students at two different institutions (on
differing schedules) the course is divided into **_subject_** or **_learning
modules_** , rather than dated, "course calendar" assignments. There are five
(5) major modules:

  1. [Blacks in Russia: A Historical Perspective](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/493/mod1.htm) 
  2. [Black Immigrants/Visitors to Russia: Pre-Revolutionary Period](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/493/mod2.htm) 
  3. [Black Experience in the Early Communist Party: Post-Revolutionary Period](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/493/mod3.htm) 
  4. [The Black Pilgrims](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/493/mod4.htm) 
  5. [Russia and the View to the United States](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/493/mod5.htm) 

Each module includes one or more of the following:

  * a brief introductory statement intended to orient you to the author(s) and the reading(s) 
  * study questions to direct your reading - to consider _before_ you read  
  * Web sites, giving resources relevant to your studies - to visit _before_ you read  
  * assigned readings 
  * short comprehension-based questions - to check yourself _after_ reading the assignments  
  * questions for your comments/insights to be posted to the [class discussion forum](http://www.uncg.edu/gar/courses/ahern/cgi/wwwboard/wwwboard1.html) 
  * essay assignment(s), to be [e-mailed/given to your instructor](mailto:k_ahern@uncg.edu). 

![Password-protectedcourse
content](http://www.uncg.edu/rom/courses/klrauch/532/samplepass.gif)The course
assignments and some of your readings are password-protected. When you click
on one of their links, you will see a dialog box, similar to the one seen at
right, requesting you to enter a username and password. Both will be given to
you by your instructor. **Enter them in lowercase only, and pay attention to
your spelling.** If either is misspelled or uppercased, the system will not
authorize your entry: You will have to try again. Contact your instructor if
you encounter problems.

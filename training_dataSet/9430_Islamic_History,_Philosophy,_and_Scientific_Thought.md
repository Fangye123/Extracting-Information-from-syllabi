#### Comprehensive Islamic History Sites

* [Studies of Countries with Significant Muslim Populations,](muslcntlibc.html) researched by the U.S. Library of Congress as part of its Area Studies on-line handbook. These multi-dimensional studies often contain very useful historical surveys of the country in question. 

* [Encyclopaedia of the Orient](http://i-cias.com/e.o/index.htm) is a well-designed and useful reference covering mainly the Middle East and North Africa. 

* [Internet Islamic History Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/islam/islamsbook.html) created by Prof. Paul Halsall of Fordham University. A wide-ranging site emphasizing concerns of modernist and late-modernist historians. It is especially noteworthy for the large amount of scanned English texts published before 1923 (and therefore copyright free). 

* [World History Textbook Review](http://www.umich.edu/~iinet/cmenas/textbooks/reviews/summaryB.html) This link consists of critical reviews written by scholars of the Middle East Studies Association (MESA) concerning various Middle East and World History textbooks. The reviews focus on the treatment of Islam and the Middle East in these textbooks. 

* [Converting Between Islamic and Western Dates](http://www.unizh.ch/ori/hegira.html) In Islamic texts dates are written using a lunar calendar beginning with the _hijra_ (the emmigration or flight) of the Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina. This is called the Hijri calendar and is designated by the abbreviation AH, in contrast to the Western solar calendar currently used in academia in the United States, which refers to the era beginning with the birth of Jesus as the Common Era and which is abbreviated by CE. The reason why a calculation beyond simple addition or subtraction must be made in order to determine the CE date if one knows the AH date (and vice versa) is because the lunar year is ten or eleven days less than the solar year. While the lunar Hijri calendar is used in the Sunni and pre-modern Iranian Shi'i world, Modern Iran uses a solar Hijri calendar that is 621 years less than the Western solar calendar. Converting between these two calendars is simply a matter of subtracting 621 from a CE date or adding 621 to a solar Hijri date. Nevertheless, converting between the lunar Hijri calendar and the solar Western calendar requires a somewhat more complicated calculation. Hence we have provided this link, which performs the required calculation. Readers interested in more information about the Islamic calendar should consult the article entitled "Islamic Calendar" in the _Oxford Encyclopedia of the Modern Islamic World._

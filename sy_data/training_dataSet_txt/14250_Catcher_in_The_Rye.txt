A heavy smoker, HoldenCaulfield claims to be already six feet, two inches tall and to have wisps of grey hair; and he wonders what happensto the ducks when the ponds freeze in winter. The novel was published on 16 July 1951, sold for $3.00, and was aBook-of-the-Month Club selection. Within two weeks, it had been reprinted five times, the next month three moretimes-though by the third edition the jacket photograph of the author had quietly disappeared. His book stayed on thebestseller list for thirty weeks, though never above fourth place.l Costing 75 cents, the Bantam paperback edition appeared in 1964. By 1981, when the same edition went for $2.50,sales still held steady, between twenty and thirty thousand copies per month, about a quarter of a million copiesannually. In paperback the novel sold over three million copies between 1953 and 1964, climbed even higher by the1980s, and continues to attract about as many buyers as it did in 1951. The durability of its appeal is astonishing.The Catcher in the Rye has gone through over seventy printings and has spread into thirty languages. Three decadesafter it first appeared, a mint copy of the first edition was already fetching about $200.2 Critical and academic interest has been less consistent; and how J. D. Salinger's only novel achieved acclaim is still abit mystifying. After its first impact came neglect: following the book reviews, only three critical pieces appeared inthe first five years. In the next four years, at least seventy essays on The Catcher in the Rye were published inAmerican and British magazines. Salinger's biographer explained why: "A feature of the youthquake was, of course,that students could now tell their teachers what to read." Ian Hamilton also notes that by the mid-1950s the novel had"become the book all brooding adolescents had to buy, [and on campuses] the indispensable manual from which coolstyles of disaffection could be borrowed."3 No American writer over the past half-century has entranced serious youngreaders more than Salinger, whose novel about the flight from Pencey Prep may lag behind only Of Mice and Menon public-school required reading lists.4 And his fiction has inspired other writers as well; the late Harold Brodkey,for example, considered it "the most influential body of work in English prose by anyone since Hemingway."5 One explanation for why The Catcher in the Rye has enjoyed such a sustained readership came over two decades afterthe novel was first published-from a middle-aged Holden Caulfield himself, as imagined by journalist Stefan Kanfer:"The new audience is never very different from the old Holden. They may not know the words, but they can humalong with the malady. My distress is theirs. They, too, long for the role of adolescent savior. They, too, are awareof the imminent death in life. As far as the sexual explosion is concerned, I suspect a lot of what you've heard is justnoise." Sex "still remains a mystery to the adolescent. I have no cure, only consolation: someone has passed thisway before." Objections to schlock and vulgarity and physical decline, and preferences for the pastoral over themachine continue to resonate, "Holden" suspects;6 and so long as the United States continues to operate very muchthis side of paradise, a reluctance to inherit what the grown-ups have bequeathed is bound to enlist sympathy. Thefantasy of withdrawal and retreat to the countryside ("Massachusetts and Vermont, and all around there . . . [are]beautiful as hell up there. It really is.") is not only a commonplace yearning but also advice Holden's creator electedto take by moving to Cornish, New Hampshire.7 But it should be conceded that generally it's the grown-ups who are in charge, and many of them have wanted to banthe widely beloved novel. Why The Catcher in the Rye has been censored (and censured) as well as cherished is acuriosity worth examining for its own sake. But how so transparently charming a novel can also exercise a peculiarallure and even emit disturbing danger signals may serve as an entree into postwar American culture as well. Bad Boys, Bad Readers One weird episode inspired by The Catcher in the Rye involves Jerry Lewis. He tried to buy the movie rights, whichwere not for sale, and to play the lead. One problem was that the director did not read the book until the 1960s, whenhe was already well into his thirties. Playing the protagonist would have been a stretch, but le roi de crazy felt someaffinity for Salinger (whom Lewis never met): "He's nuts also." Curiously Holden himself mentions the word"crazy" and its cognates (like "mad," "madman," and "insane") over fifty times, more than the reverberant "phony."8 Indeed the history of this novel cannot be disentangled from the way the mentally unbalanced have read it. In oneinstance the reader is himself fictional: the protagonist of John Fowles's first book, which captures the unnervingcharacter of Salinger's only novel as an index of taste, perhaps of moral taste. In the second section of The Collector,told from the viewpoint of the victim, the kidnapped Miranda Grey recounts in her diary that she asks her captor,lepidopterist Frederick Clegg, whether he reads "proper books-real books." When he admits that "light novels aremore my line," she recommends The Catcher in the Rye instead: "I've almost finished it. Do you know I've read ittwice and I'm five years younger than you are?" Sullenly he promises to read it. Later she notices him doing so,"several times . . . look[ing] to see how many pages more he had to read. He reads it only to show me how hard heis trying." After the duty has been discharged, over a week later, the collector admits: "I don't see much point in it."When Miranda counters, "You realize this is one of the most brilliant studies of adolescence ever written?" heresponds that Holden "sounds a mess to me." "Of course he's a mess. But he realizes he's a mess, he tries to express what he feels, he's a human being for all hisfaults. Don't you even feel sorry for him?" "I don't like the way he talks." "I don't like the way you talk," she replies. "But I don't treat you as below any serious notice or sympathy." Clegg acknowledges: "I suppose it's very clever. To write like that and all." "I gave you that book to read because I thought you would feel identified with him. You're a Holden Caulfield. Hedoesn't fit anywhere and you don't." "I don't wonder, the way he goes on. He doesn't try to fit." Miranda insists: "He tries to construct some sort of reality in his life, some sort of decency." "It's not realistic. Going to a posh school and his parents having money. He wouldn't behave like that. In myopinion." She has the final word (at least in her diary): "You get on the back of everything vital, everything trying to be honestand free, and you bear it down." Modern art, she realizes, embarrasses and fascinates Clegg; it "shocks him" and stirs "guilty ideas in him" because hesees it as "all vaguely immoral." For the mass audience at which William Wyler's 1965 film adaptation was aimed,Clegg's aesthetic world is made less repellent and more conventional, and the conversation about The Catcher in theRye is abbreviated.9 In a more class-conscious society than is the United States, Fowles's loner finds something repugnant about therecklessness of the privileged protagonist. In a more violent society than England, types like Frederick Clegg mightidentify with Holden Caulfield's alienation from "normal" people so thoroughly that they become assassins. To besure, The Catcher in the Rye is bereft of violence; and no novel seems less likely to activate the impulse to "lockand load." But this book nevertheless has exercised an eerie allure for asocial young men who, glomming on toHolden's estrangement, yield to the terrifying temptations of murder. "Lacking a sense of who he is," such a person"shops among artifacts of our culture-books, movies, TV programs, song lyrics, newspaper clippings-to fashion acharacter." Instead of authentic individuality, Priscilla Johnson McMillan has written, "all that is left is a collectionof cultural shards-the bits and pieces of popular culture, torn from their contexts."10 In December 1980, with a copy of Salinger's novel in his pocket, Mark David Chapman murdered John Lennon.Before the police arrived, the assassin began reading the novel to himself and, when he was sentenced, read aloud thepassage that begins with "anyway, I keep picturing all these little kids" and ends with "I'd just be the catcher in therye and all" (pp. 224-25). Daniel M. Stashower has speculated ingeniously that Chapman wanted the former Beatle'sinnocence to be preserved in the only way possible-by death (the fate of Holden's revered brother Allie). Of course itcould be argued that the assassin was not a conscientious reader, since Holden realizes on the carrousel that childrenhave to be left alone, that they cannot be saved from themselves: "The thing with kids is, if they want to grab for thegold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off, they fall off" (pp. 273-74). No oldercatcher should try to intervene.11 Nor was Chapman the only Beatles fan to reify happiness as a warm gun. John Hinckley, Jr., described himself inhis high school days as "a rebel without a cause" and was shocked to hear that Lennon had been murdered. A yearlater Hinckley himself tried to kill President Reagan. In Hinckley's hotel room, police found, along with a 1981John Lennon color calendar, Salinger's novel among a half-dozen paperbacks. Noting the "gruesome congruencesbetween these loners," Richard Schickel wondered whether Chapman and Hinckley could "really believe theirdisaffections were similar to Holden Caulfield's."12 One stab at an answer would be provided in John Guare's play Six Degrees of Separation, which opened in New Yorkin 1990 and which he adapted for Fred Schepsi's film three years later. An imposter calling himself Paul insinuateshimself into a well-heeled family; he is a perfect stranger (or appears to be). Pretending to be a Harvard undergraduatewho has just been mugged, posing as the son of actor Sidney Poitier, Paul claims that his thesis is devoted toSalinger's novel and its odd connections to criminal loners: A substitute teacher out on Long Island was dropped from his job for fighting with a student. A few weeks later, theteacher returned to the classroom, shot the student unsuccessfully, held the class hostage and then shot himselfSuccessfully. This fact caught my eye: last sentence. Times. A neighbor described him as a nice boy. Always readingCatcher in the Rye. Paul then mentions "the nitwit-Chapman" and insists that "the reading of that book would be his defense" for havingkilled Lennon. Hinckley, too, had "said if you want my defense all you have to do is read Catcher in the Rye. Itseemed to be time to read it again." Paul reads it as a "manifesto of hate" against phonies, a touching story, comic because the boy wants to do so much and can't do anything. Hates all phoniness and onlylies to others. Wants everyone to like him, is only hateful, and is completely self-involved. In other words, a prettyaccurate picture of a male adolescent. And what alarms me about the book-not the book so much as the aura aboutit-is this: The book is primarily about paralysis. The boy can't function. And at the end, before he can run away andstart a new life, it starts to rain and he folds.... But the aura around this book of Salinger's-which perhaps should beread by everyone but young men-is this: It mirrors like a fun house mirror and amplifies like a distorted speaker oneof the great tragedies of our times-the death of the imagination, [which] now stands as a synonym for somethingoutside ourselves. A smooth liar, Paul later admits (or claims) that a Groton commencement address delivered a couple of years earlierwas the source of his insights.13 Holden has thus been born to trouble-yet another reminder that, in the opinion of long queues of literary critics, youcan't know about him without your having read a book by Mr. Mark Twain called The Adventures of HuckleberryFinn, which told the truth mainly about the intensity of the yearning for authenticity and innocence that marks thepicaresque quest. Huck and Holden share the fate of being both beloved and banned; such reactions were not unrelated.When the Concord (Massachusetts) public library proscribed The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn soon after itspublication, the author gloated that not even his Innocents Abroad had sold more copies more quickly; and "thoseidiots in Concord" "have given us a rattling tip-top puff which will go into every paper in the country.... That willsell 25,000 copies for us sure."14 Salinger's novel does not appear to have been kept off the shelves in Concord but did cause enough of a stir to makethe short list of the most banned books in school libraries, curricula, and public libraries.15 In 1973 the AmericanSchool Board Journal called this monster best-seller "the most widely censored book in the United States."16 It wasnoted nearly a decade later that The Catcher in the Rye "had the dubious distinction of being at once the mostfrequently censored book across the nation and the second-most frequently taught novel in public high schools."17Anne Levinson, the assistant director of the Office of Intellectual Freedom in Chicago, called The Catcher in the Ryeprobably "a perennial No. 1 on the censorship hit list," narrowly ahead of Of Mice and Men and The Grapes of Wrathand perhaps of Eldridge Cleaver's Soul on Ice as well.18 No postwar American novel has been subjected to more-andmore intense-efforts to prevent the young from reading it. Some examples: The National Organization for Decent Literature declared it objectionable by 1956. Five years later ateacher in a San Jose, California, high school who had included the novel on the twelfth-grade supplementary readinglist was transferred and the novel dropped. The Catcher in the Rye was excised from the list of approved books inKershaw County, South Carolina, after the sheriff of Camden declared part of the novel obscene.19 In 1978 the novelwas banned in the high schools of Issaquah, Washington, in the wake of a campaign led by a diligent citizen whotabulated 785 "profanities" and charged that including Holden in the syllabus was "part of an overall Communist plotin which a lot of people are used and may not even be aware of it."20 Three school board members in Issaquah notonly voted in favor of banning The Catcher in the Rye but also against renewing the contract of the schoolsuperintendent who had explicitly sanctioned the right of English teachers to assign the book. The board memberswere recalled, however. A school board member also confiscated a copy of Salinger's novel from a high schoollibrary in Asheville, North Carolina, in 1973. Several high school teachers have been fired or forced to resign forhaving assigned The Catcher in the Rye.21 California was the site of two well-reported incidents. The first erupted in 1962 in Temple City, near Pasadena, at aBoard of Education meeting. Salinger's book had been assigned as supplementary reading for the eleventh grade. Aparent objected, in the main, to the "crude, profane and obscene" language. For good measure, though, the book wasalso condemned for its literary assault on patriotism, "home life, [the] teaching profession, religion and so forth."Another vigilant parent, imploring the President of the United States summarily to fire anyone writing such a book,had obviously confused the reclusive novelist with John F. Kennedy's amiable press secretary, Pierre Salinger.22 The Catcher in the Rye was also banned from the supplementary reading list of Boron High School, located on theedge of the Mojave Desert. The proscription had an interesting effect. Salinger "has gained a new readership amongtownspeople," the New York Times reported, "and Helen Nelson, the local librarian, has a waiting list of fifteenpeople for the book that she says has been sitting on the shelf all these years pretty much unnoticed." The campaignagainst the book had been fueled by its profanity, which aroused the most heated objections. Vickie Swindler, theparent of a fourteen-year-old girl, was startled to see three "goddamns" on page 32. She recalled phoning the schooland demanding to know: "How the hell [sic] did this teacher [Shelley Keller-Gage] get this book?" Locals whosympathized with the censors offered a curious interpretation of their motives, which they compared to Holden'sdream of becoming a catcher in the rye to keep innocence intact; the protagonist and the parents trying to muzzle himshared a desire to exempt children from the vulgarity and corruption of the adult world. Yet, as Mrs. Keller-Gagenoted, "Things are not innocent any more, and I think we've got to help them [i.e., children] deal with that, to makeresponsible choices, to be responsible citizens." Parents were "wanting to preserve the innocence of the children" invain. The Times reported that she offered an alternative assignment for pupils whose parents were opposed to TheCatcher in the Rye: Ray Bradbury's Dandelion Wine.23 When the ban took effect in the new term, Mrs. Keller-Gage put her three dozen copies of Salinger's novel "on a topshelf of her classroom closet, inside a tightly taped cardboard box." Raise high the bookshelf, censors. In place ofThe Catcher in the Rye, she announced, she would assign another Bradbury novel, Fahrenheit 451,24 the titlereferring to the presumed "temperature at which book-paper catches fire, and burns." This dystopian novel aboutbook-burning was published in 1953, though a shorter version, entitled "The Fireman," had appeared in GalaxyScience Fiction in 1950. Both versions were too early to allude to Salinger's novel, which is neither shown norrecited in Francois Truffaut's 1966 film adaptation (though one item visibly consumed is an issue of Cahiers duCinema). Efforts at suppression were not confined to secondary schools. A prominent Houston attorney, "whose daughter hadbeen assigned the novel in an English class at the University of Texas, threatened to remove the girl from theUniversity," Harper's reported. "The aggrieved father sent copies [of the novel] to the governor, the chancellor of theuniversity, and a number of state officials. The state senator from Houston threatened to read passages from the bookon the senate floor to show the sort of thing they teach in Austin. The lawyerfather said Salinger used language `nosane person would use' and accused the university of `corrupting the moral fibers [sic] of our youth."' He concededthat the novel "is not a hard-core Communist-type book, but it encourages a lessening of spiritual values which inturn leads to communism."25 In making appointments to the department of English at the University of Montana, Leslie A. Fiedler recalled that"the only unforgivable thing in the university or the state was to be `controversial."' He nevertheless "began to makeoffers to young instructors who had quarreled with their administrators, or had asked their students to read Catcher inthe Rye, or had themselves written poetry containing dirty words, or were flagrantly Jewish or simply Black." Thenarrator of a recent academic novel, Mustang Sally, recalls that "the chairman of the department has asked us all touse our best judgment in avoiding confrontation with the evangelicals . . . such as the group who staged a pray-in' atthe Greensburg High School library because The Catcher in the Rye was on the shelves. It has since been removed,along with the principal." No wonder, then, that one columnist, though writing for the newspaper of record,whimsically claimed to "lose count of the number of times the book has been challenged or banned."26 Such animosity had become a predictable feature of the far right by the 1980s, when an outfit named EducationalResearch Analysts, financed by Richard Viguerie, a leading fundraiser for right-wing organizations, was formed toexamine nearly every textbook considered for adoption anywhere in the nation. "The group has assembled a list of 67categories under which a book may be banned. Category 43 ('Trash') included The Catcher in the Rye," the NewRepublic reported. Perhaps Salinger should have counted his blessings, since the eclectic Category 44 consisted ofthe "works of questionable writers" like Malcolm X, Langston Hughes, and Ogden Nash.27 It is more surprising that moral objections surfaced in the pages of Ramparts, the brashest of the magazines to give aradical tincture to the 1960s. The monthly had begun under Roman Catholic auspices, however; and though Simonede Beauvoir's The Second Sex was deemed a work of depravity on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum, Salinger wasaccorded the same treatment as Genet, Proust, Joyce, and D. H. Lawrence: omission.28 But individual Catholicscould still get incensed over The Catcher in the Rye, as the new editor of Ramparts, Warren Hinckle, discovered oneevening. He was having a conversation with the new fiction editor, Helen Keating, who was married to themagazine's new publisher. Hinckle recalled: A great debate somehow began over the rather precious subject of J. D.Salinger. The setting was vaguely Inquisitional.... They all listened attentively as [Edward] Keating, suddenly a fieryprosecutor, denounced Salinger for moral turpitude. Keating expressed similar opinions about the degeneracy ofwriters such as Tennessee Williams and Henry Miller: corruption, moral decay, the erosion of the classic values ofWestern Civilization, et cetera, ad infinitum. His special contempt for Salinger seemed to have something to do withthe fact that he had found his oldest son reading a paperback book by the man. Keating became enraged enough to make "the hyperbolic assertion, which he later retracted, that if he were President,he would put J. D. Salinger in jail! I asked why. `Because he's dirty,' Ed said. I barely recalled something in TheCatcher in the Rye about Holden Caulfield in the back seat unhooking a girl's bra," Hinckle recalled. Despite thelyric, "If a body catch a body," in fact few popular novels are so fully exempt from the leer of the sensualist; andeven though Holden claims to be "probably the biggest sex maniac you ever saw," he admits it's only "in my mind"(p. 81). In any case, Hinckle was baffled by Keating's tirade and "unleashed a more impassioned defense of Salinger than Inormally would have felt impelled to make of a voguish writer whose mortal sin was his Ivy League slickness." Thechief consequence of the argument was Keating's discovery of a "bomb," by which he meant "a hot story. The 'bomb'which exploded in the first issue of Ramparts was the idea of a symposium on J. D. Salinger"-with Hinckle for thedefense and Keating and a friend of his for the prosecution. That friend, Robert O. Bowen, complained in theinaugural issue in 1962 that Salinger was not only anti-Catholic but somehow also "pro-Jewish and proNegro."Bowen accused the novelist of being so subversive that he was "vehemently anti-Army" (though Salinger had landedon Utah Beach on D-Day), "even anti-America," a writer who subscribed to "the sick line transmitted by Mort Sahl"and other "cosmopolitan think people." Though Bowen was vague in identifying the sinister campaigns thisimpenetrably private novelist was managing to wage, alignments with the AntiDefamation League and "other Jewishpressure groups" were duly noted, and Salinger's sympathy for "Negro chauvinism" was denounced. "Let those of uswho are Christian and who love life lay this book aside as the weapon of an enemy," Bowen advised.29 Such was thelevel of literary analysis at the birth of Ramparts. The Catcher in the Rye has even taken on an iconic significance precisely because it is reviled as well as revered.What if the Third Reich had won the Second World War by defeating Britain? one novelist has wondered. Set in1964, Fatherland imagines a past in which Salinger is among four foreign authors listed as objectionable to theGreater Reich. Those writers, banned by the authorities, are esteemed by younger Germans "rebelling against theirparents. Questioning the state. Listening to American radio stations. Circulating their crudely printed copies ofproscribed books.... Chiefly, they protested against the war-the seemingly endless struggle against theAmericanbacked Soviet guerrillas." But forget about a history that never happened. One of the two regimes that hadsupplanted the defeated Reich was the German Democratic Republic, whose censors were wary of American culturalimports. In the 1960s, Kurt Hager served as the leading ideologist on the Central Committee of the East Germanregime. Resisting publication of a translation of Salinger's novel, Hager feared that its protagonist might captivateCommunist youth. Though a translation did eventually appear and proved popular among young readers in the GDR,Hager refused to give up the fight. Appropriate role models were "winners," he insisted, like the regime's Olympicathletes, not "losers" like Holden Caulfield.30 Yet anti-anti-Communism could make use of the novel too. Its reputation for inciting censorious anxiety hadbecome so great by 1990 that in the film Guilty by Suspicion, a terrified screenwriter is shown burning his books inhis driveway a few hours after testifying before a rump session of the House UnAmerican Activities Committee.Shocked at this bonfire of the humanities, director David Merrill (Robert De Niro) categorizes what goes up inflames as "all good books"-though the only titles he cites are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Catcher in theRye. The decision of writer-director Irwin Winkler to include Salinger's novel, however, is historically (if notcanonically) implausible. When the film opens in September 1951, Merrill is shown returning from two months inFrance; a hot-off-the-press copy of the best-seller must therefore have been rushed to him in Paris if he couldpronounce on the merits of the book on his first evening back in Los Angeles. The attacks on The Catcher in the Rye gathered a momentum of their own and "show no signs of tapering off," onestudent of book-banning concluded in 1979. The novel became so notorious for igniting controversy "that manycensors freely admit they have never read it, but are relying on the reputation the book has garnered."31 AnneLevinson added: "Usually the complaints have to do with blasphemy or what people feel is irreligious. Or they saythey find the language generally offensive or vulgar, or there is a sort of general `family values' kind of complaint,that the book undermines parental authority, that the portrayal of Holden Caulfield is not a good role model forteenagers." It was judged suitable for Chelsea Clinton, however. In 1993 the First Lady gave her daughter a copy toread while vacationing on Martha's Vineyard. The Boston Globe used the occasion to editorialize against persistentcensorship, since "Salinger's novel of a 1950s coming of age still ranks among the works most frequently challengedby parents seeking to sanitize their children's school reading."32 Assigning Meaning to Growing Up Absurd Few American novels of the postwar era have elicited as much scholarly and critical attention as The Catcher in theRye, and therefore little that is fresh can still be proposed about so closely analyzed a text. But the social contextwithin which the novel has generated such anxiety remains open to interpretation, If anything new can be said aboutthis book, its status within the cross-hairs of censors offers the greatest promise. What needs further consideration isnot why this novel is so endearing but why it has inspired campaigns to ban it. Literary critics have tended to exposethe uncanny artistry by which Salinger made Holden Caulfield into the loved one but have been far less curious aboutthe intensity of the desire to muffle him. It is nevertheless possible to isolate several explanations for the power ofthis novel to affect-and disturb-readers outside of departments of English. The "culture wars" of the last third of the twentieth century are fundamentally debates about the 1960s. That decademarked the end of what historian Tom Engelhardt has labeled "victory culture," indeed the end of "the American Wayof Life," phrased in the singular. The 1960s constituted a caesura in the formation of national self-definition, nor hasconfidence in e pluribus unum been entirely restored. At first glance it might seem surprising for The Catcher in theRye to have contributed in some small fashion to fragmentation. Nevertheless such a case, however tentative, hasbeen advanced. Since nothing in history is created ex nihilo, at least part of the 1960s, it has been argued, must havesprung from at least part of the 1950s. Literary critics Carol and Richard Ohmann, for example, concede that the young narrator lacks the will to try tochange society. They nevertheless contend that his creator recorded "a serious critical mimesis of bourgeois life in theEastern United States, ca. 1950-of snobbery, privilege, class injury, culture as a badge of superiority, sexualexploitation, education subordinated to status, warped social feeling, competitiveness, stunted human possibility, thelist could go on." They praise Salinger's acuity "in imagining these hurtful things, though not in explainingthem"-or in hinting how they might be corrected. The Catcher in the Rye thus "mirrors a contradiction of bourgeoissociety" and of "advanced capitalism," which promises many good things but frustrates their acquisition and equitabledistribution. In this manner readers are encouraged at least to conceive of the urgent need for change, even if they'renot able to reconfigure Holden's musings into a manual for enacting it.33 That moment would have to await the crisis of the Vietnam War, which "converted Salinger's novel into a catalystfor revolt, converting anomie into objectified anger," John Seelye has argued. The Catcher in the Rye became "athreshold text to the decade of the sixties, ten years after it appeared at the start of the fifties, [when it was] aminority text stating a minor view." In the axial shift to the left that occurred in the 1960s, the sensibility of a prepschool drop-out could be re-charged and politicized: "Catcher likewise supplied not only the rationale for the antiwar,anti-regimentation movements of the sixties and seventies but provided the anti-ideological basis for many of theactual novels about Vietnam."34 The 1960s mavericks ("the highly sensitive, the tormented") who would brand social injustice as itself obscene were,according to Charles Reich, real-life versions of what Holden had groped toward becoming. Salinger's protagonistmay be too young, or too rich, to bestir himself outward. But he was "a fictional version of the first youngprecursors of Consciousness III. Perhaps there was always a bit of Consciousness III in every teenager, but normallyit quickly vanished. Holden sees through the established world: they are phonies and he is merciless in his honesty.But what was someone like Holden to do? A subculture of 'beats' grew up, and a beatnik world flourished briefly, butfor most people it represented only another dead end," Reich commented. "Other Holdens might reject the legalprofession and try teaching literature or writing instead, letting their hair grow a little bit longer as well. But theyremained separated individuals, usually ones from affluent but unhappy, tortured family backgrounds, and theirdifferences with society were paid for by isolation." In making America more green, Holden was portrayed as anavatar of "subterranean awareness."35 Daniel Isaacson also reads the novel as seeding later revolt. The narrator of E. L. Doctorow's The Book of Daniel,published exactly two decades after The Catcher in the Rye, even echoes Holden in self-consciously repudiatingDickens's contribution to Con II: "Let's see, what other David Copperfield kind of crap" should he tell you? But thepersonal quickly becomes political, when Daniel insists that "the Trustees of Ohio State were right in 1956 whenthey canned the English instructor for assigning Catcher in the Rye to his freshman class. They knew there is noqualitative difference between the kid who thinks it's funny to fart in chapel, and Che Guevara. They knew thenHolden Caulfield would found SDS."36 Of course Daniel thinks of himself as an outcast and is eager to re-establish and legitimate his radical lineage, and sohis assumption that the trustees might have been shrewd enough to foresee guerrillas in the mist must be treatedwith skepticism. But consider Tom Hayden, a founder of Students for a Democratic Society (and in the 1950s aparishioner of Father Charles Coughlin in Royal Oak, Michigan). As a teenager Hayden had considered Salinger'sprotagonist (along with novelist Jack Kerouac and actor James Dean) an "alternative cultural model." "The life crisesthey personified spawned. . . political activism," which some who had been adolescents in the 1950s foundliberating. Hayden remembers being touched not only by Holden's assault on the "phonies" and conformists but byhis "caring side," his sympathy for "underdogs and innocents." The very "attempt to be gentle and humane . . .makes Holden a loser in the 'game' of life. Unable to be the kind of man required by prep schools and corporations,"Salinger's protagonist could find no exit within American society. Undefiant and confused, Holden neverthelessserved as "the first image of middle-class youth growing up absurd," which Hayden would situate at thepsychological center of the Port Huron Statement.37 The dynamism inherent in youthful revolt, one historian has claimed, can best be defined as "a mystique . . that fusedelements of Marlon Brando's role in The Wild One, James Dean's portrayal in Rebel without a Cause, J. D.Salinger's Holden Caulfield in Catcher in the Rye, the rebels of Blackboard Jungle, and the driving energy andaggressive sexuality of the new heroes of rock 'n' roll into a single image. The mystique emphasized a hunger forauthenticity and sensitivity." But something is askew here, for Holden is too young to have felt the Dionysianeffects of rock 'n' roll, which erupted about three years after he left Pencey Prep. A "sex maniac" only in his head, hehardly represents "aggressive sexuality" either. The Wild One, Rebel without a Cause, and Blackboard Jungle are"goddam movies," which Holden professes to hate, because "they can ruin you. I'm not kidding" (p. 136). His owntastes are emphatically literary, ranging from The Great Gatsby and Out of Africa to Thomas Hardy and RingLardner. Even if the bland official ethos of the 1950s ultimately failed to repress the rambunctious energies thepopular arts were about to unleash, Roland Marchand understands that the "mystique" he has identified would not beeasily radicalized. Indeed, it could be tamed. Conservative consolidation was a more predictable outcome: "If theproblems of a society are embedded in its social structure and are insulated from change by layers of ideologicaltradition, popular culture is an unlikely source of remedy. It is far more likely to serve needs for diversion andtransitory compensation . . . [and] solace."38 Such dynamism could not be politicized. The deeper flaw with interpreting The Catcher in the Rye as a harbinger of revolt is the aura of passivity thatpervades the novel. Alienation does not always lead to, and can remain the antonym of, action. Salinger's ownsensibility was definitively pre- (or anti-) Sixties. His "conviction that our inner lives greatly matter," John Updikeobserved in 1961, "peculiarly qualifies him to sing of an America, where, for most of us, there seems little to do butto feel. Introversion, perhaps, has been forced upon history" rather than the other way around. Therefore "an age ofnuance, of ambiguous gestures and psychological jockeying" could account for the popularity of Salinger's work.39 Describing Holden as "a misfit in society because he refuses to adjust" and because he lacks the self-discipline tocultivate privacy, one young literary critic of the fifties was struck by "the quixotic futility" of the protagonist's"outrage" at all the planet's obscenities, by his isolation. Holden seems to have sat for psychologist KennethKeniston's portrait of uncommitted youth: those who have the most to live for but find no one to look up to; thosewho are the most economically and socially advantaged but feel the deepest pangs of alienation.40 Jack Newfield('60) was a charter member of SDS but remembers Hunter College as mired in an apathy "no public question seemedto touch." His fellow students "were bereft of passions, of dreams, of gods. . . . And their Zeitgeist-J. D.Salinger-stood for a total withdrawal from reality into the womb of childhood, innocence, and mystical Zen."Holden's creator, evidently, had captured the spirit of the Silent Generation.41 It may not be accidental that David Riesman, whose most famous book was a veritable touchstone of social analysisin the era, assigned The Catcher in the Rye in his Harvard sociology course on Character and Social Structure in theUnited States. He did so "perhaps," a Time reporter speculated, "because every campus has its lonely crowd ofimitation Holdens." Indeed, Holden demonstrates the characteristics of anomie, which is associated with "ruleless"and "ungoverned" conduct, that Riesman had described in The Lonely Crowd; the anomic are "virtually synonymouswith [the] maladjusted." Though Salinger's narrator does not quite exhibit "the lack of emotion and emptiness ofexpression" by which "the ambulatory patients of modern culture" can be recognized, he does display a "vehementhatred of institutional confines" that was bound to make his peers (if not his psychoanalyst) uneasy.42 One reviewer,in true Fifties fashion, even blamed Holden himself for his loneliness, "because he has shut himself away from thenormal activities of boyhood, games, the outdoors, friendship."43 It is true that Holden hates schools like PenceyPrep, where "you have to keep making believe you give a damn if the football team loses, and all you do is talkabout girls and liquor and sex all day, and everybody sticks together in these dirty little goddam cliques" (p. 170). ButHolden remains confined to his era, unable to connect the dots from those cliques to a larger society that might meritsome rearrangement. Nor does the novel expand the reader's horizons beyond those of the narrator; it does not getfrom pathos to indignation. For The Catcher in the Rye is utterly apolitical-unlike its only rival in arousing the ire of conservative parents.Steinbeck's fiction directs the attention of susceptible young readers to exploitation of the weak and the abuse ofpower. But a serious critique of capitalism would not be found in Salinger's text even if a full field investigationwere ordered. Certainly Holden's fantasy of secluding himself in a cabin in the woods is scarcely a prescription forsocial activism: "I'd pretend I was one of those deaf-mutes. That way I wouldn't have to have any goddam stupiduseless conversations with anybody. If anybody wanted to tell me something, they'd have to write it on a piece ofpaper and shove it over to me. They'd get bored as hell doing that after a while, and then I'd be through with havingconversations for the rest of my life" (pp. 257-58). Such passages will hardly alarm those wishing to repudiate orerase the 1960s, which is why The Catcher in the Rye does not belong to the history of dissidence. Growing Up Absurd (1960) sports a title and a perspective that Holden might have appreciated, but Paul Goodmandoes not mention the novel. Published at the end of the tumultuous, unpredictable decade, Theodore Roszak's TheMaking of a Counter Culture (which Newsweek dubbed "the best guide yet published to the meaning. . . of youthfuldissent") likewise fails to mention Salinger, though Holden certainly personifies (or anticipates) "the ethos ofdisaffiliation that is fiercely obnoxious to the adult society." In 1962 the editor of a collection of critical essays onSalinger-the future editor-in-chief of Time-found American campuses innocent of activism: "`Student riots' are afamiliar and significant factor in European politics. The phenomenon has no equivalent in the United States."44 Thatgeneralization would soon be falsified. But it should be noted that authors who have fathomed how the 1950s becamethe 1960s (like Morris Dickstein, Fred Inglis, Maurice Isserman, James Miller) ignore the impact of Salinger'snovel. Because any reading of the novel as a prefiguration of the 1960s is ultimately so unpersuasive, an over-reaction hasset in. Alan Nadel, for example, has fashioned Holden into a Cold Warrior, junior division. "Donning his red huntinghat, he attempts to become the good Red-hunter, ferreting out the phonies and the subversives, but in so doing heemulates the bad Red-hunters," Nadel has written. "Uncovering duplicity was the theme of the day," he adds, so that"in thinking constantly about who or what was phony, Caulfield was doing no more than following the instructionsof J. Edgar Hoover, the California Board of Regents, The Nation [sic], the Smith Act, and the Hollywood Ten....Each citizen was potentially both the threat and the threatened." After all, hadn't Gary Cooper, testifying beforeHUAC, defined Communism as something that was not "on the level"? Nadel equates Caulfield's "disdain forHollywood" with HUAC's, nor could the young prostitute's mention of Melvyn Douglas have been accidental-sinceCongressman Richard Nixon had run against Helen Gahagan Douglas, and her husband was himself "a prominentHollywood liberal." Nadel concludes that "the solution to Caulfield's dilemma becomes renouncing speech itself."Having named names, he realizes: "I sort of miss everybody I told about.... It's funny. Don't ever tell anybodyanything," he advises; that is, don't be an informer. "If you do, you start missing everybody" (pp. 276-77). Thenarrator "spoke for the cold war HUAC witness," Nadel argued, "expressing existential angst over the nature andmeaning of his `testimony."'45 Such an interpretation is far-fetched: Holden is no more interested in politics than hiscreator, and he's considerably less interested in sanctioning conformity than were the Red-hunters. Citizens who abhor the 1960s commonly deplore one of its most prominent legacies: the fragmentation into"identity politics," the loss of civic cohesion. Those worrying over this sin also will not find it in Salinger's book,which promotes no class consciousness, racial consciousness, or ethnic consciousness of any sort. Sol Salinger hadstrayed so far from Judaism that he became an importer of hams and cheeses;46 and his son left no recognizablyJewish imprint on his fiction. Nor does his novel evoke the special plight of young women and girls. That omissionwould be rectified about two generations later, when Eve Horowitz's first novel appeared. Her young narrator andprotagonist is not only female but emphatically Jewish, and she longs to meet her own Holden Caulfield. JaneSinger recalls: "I hadn't known any males who were as depressed as I was in high school, except for maybe HoldenCaulfield, and I didn't really know him." As she's packing to leave Cleveland for Oberlin College, she muses,"besides clothes and shampoo and The Catcher in the Rye, I couldn't think of anything else to bring."47 In heraccount of growing up female, Horowitz may have wanted to correct the imbalance David Riesman identified in1961, when, attempting to explain the United States to a Japanese audience, he had commented on the inscrutablepopularity of Salinger's novel: "Boys are frustrated because they aren't cowboys, and girls are frustrated because theyaren't boys." The sociologist noted that "women have been the audience for American fiction and for movies. Thereare no girls' stories comparable to Catcher in the Rye. Yet girls can adapt themselves and identify with such a book,while a boy can't so easily identify with a girl."48 In the literary marketplace, Riesman speculated, readers aren'tturned off or away if the central characters are male but only if they are female. How many Boy Scouts and ExplorerScouts have been moved by reading The Bell Jar? The Curse of Culture Another way to understand the power of Salinger's novel to generate controversy is to recognize its vulnerability tomoralistic criticism. From wherever the source-call it Puritanism, or puritanism, or Victorianism-there persists atradition of imposing religious standards upon art or of rejecting works of the imagination because they violateconventional ethical codes. According to this legacy, books are neither good nor bad without "for you" being added asa criterion of judgment. This entwining of the aesthetic and the moralistic was obvious as prize committees struggledwith the terms of Joseph Pulitzer's instructions that the novels to be honored in his name "shall best present thewhole atmosphere of American life." But until 1927, the novels selected more accurately conveyed "the wholesomeatmosphere of American life."49 That eliminated Dreiser. Had the subtle revision of Pulitzer's own intentions notbeen overturned, virtually all great writers would have been categorically excluded. Nabokov comes quickly to mind.His most famous novel was given to the good family man Adolf Eichmann, then imprisoned in Israel, but wasreturned after two days with an indignant rejection: "Das ist aber ein sehr unerfreuliches Buch"-quite an unwholesomebook. Lolita is narrated from the viewpoint of an adult, a pervert whose ornate vocabulary made the novelunintelligible to young readers, and so censors passed it by to target The Catcher in the Rye. It is a measure ofSalinger's stature among other writers that, though famously dismissive of many literary giants, Nabokov wroteprivately of his fellow New Yorker contributor: "I do admire him very much."50 But the reviewer for The Christian Science Monitor did not: The Catcher in the Rye "is not fit for children to read";its central character is "preposterous, profane, and pathetic beyond belief." Too many young readers might even wantto emulate Holden, "as too easily happens when immorality and perversion are recounted by writers of talent whosework is countenanced in the name of art or good intention."51 Here was an early sign of trouble. Nor wasrespectability enhanced by the novel's first appearance in paperback, for it was offered as pulp fiction, a genre thatbeckoned with promises of illicit pleasure. The common 1950s practice of issuing serious books in pulp meant that"dozens of classic novels appeared in packages that were cartoonish, sordid or merely absurd." The aim of suchmarketing, Julie Lasky has suggested, was to grab "the attention of impulse shoppers in drugstores and bus depots;slogans jammed across the four-inch width of paperbound covers compressed the nuances of prizewinning authorsinto exaggerated come-ons." The 1953 paperback edition of Salinger's novel, for example, assured buyers that "thisunusual book may shock you . . . but you will never forget it." The illustration on the cover depicted a prostitutestanding near Holden and may have served as the only means by which some citizens judged the book. The cover sooffended the author that it contributed to his move to Bantam when his contract with Signet expired. By then, thepulping of classics had largely ended in the wake of hearings by the House of Representatives Select Committee onCurrent Pornographic Materials. But the availability of such cheap editions of books ranging from the serious to thelurid drew the curiosity of censors as well as bargain-hunters. The vulnerability of Salinger's novel testified to theaptness of Walter Lippmann's generalization that censorship "is actually applied in proportion to the vividness, thedirectness, and the intelligibility of the medium which circulates the subversive idea." Movie screens, he wrote in1927, therefore tend to be more censored than the stage, which is more censored than newspapers and magazines. But"the novel is even freer than the press today because it is an even denser medium of expression."52 At least that wasthe case until the paperback revolution facilitated the expansion of the syllabus. Of course, the paperback revolution was not the only cultural shift affecting the reception of the novel. The career ofThe Catcher in the Rye is virtually synchronous with the Cold War, and Holden Caulfield takes a stand of sorts: hecalls himself "a pacifist" (p. 59). For men slightly older than Holden in 1949-50, military conscription was more orless universal, yet he predicts that "it'd drive me crazy if I had to be in the Army. . . . I swear if there's ever anotherwar, they better just take me out and stick me in front of a firing squad. I wouldn't object." Indeed he goes further:"I'm sort of glad they've got the atomic bomb invented. If there's ever another war, I'm going to sit right the hell ontop of it. I'll volunteer for it, I swear to God I will" (pp. 182, 183). Barely a decade later, Stanley Kubrick'spitch-black comedy Dr. Strangelove (1964) would confront nuclear terror by showing Major "King" Kong (SlimPickens) doing precisely what Holden vows he will step forward to do. With such images in mind, one interpreterhas thus boldly claimed that "the fear of nuclear holocaust, not the fear of four-letter words[,]" sparked controversyabout The Catcher in the Rye.53 Salinger's novel may thus also be about history veering out of control, about the abyss into which parents could nolonger prevent their offspring from staring, about the impotence to which a can-do people was unaccustomed. "Thelack of faith in the American character expressed in the Catcher controversies," Professor Pamela Steinle has argued,"is rooted not in doubts about the strength of adolescent Americans' character but in recognition of the powerlessnessof American adults-as parents, professionals and community leaders-to provide a genuine sense of the future for theadolescents in their charge." According to Steinle, the novel indicts "adult apathy and complicity in the constructionof a social reality in which the American character cannot develop in any meaningful sense beyond adolescence." Nordoes the novel warrant any hope that the condition can be remedied. The story is, after all, told from a sanitarium inCalifornia-a grim terminus given the common belief that the West offers a second chance. No wonder, then, thatJohn Seelye, who ended his own revised version of The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn with Huck's bleakestpessimism ("I didn't much care if the goddamn sun never come up again"), could read Salinger's book "as a lengthysuicide note with a blank space at the end to sign your name."54 The advantage of Steinle's argument is that she situates the controversy over The Catcher in the Rye where itactually took place, which is less in the pages of Ramparts than at school board meetings. In such settings, thenovel was branded by parents as a threat to their control and heralded by teachers as a measure of their professionalautonomy and authority. But the disadvantage of Steinle's view is the scarcity of direct evidence that nuclear fearsfueled the debate. Neither those who condemned The Catcher in the Rye nor its defenders made the specter of atomiccatastrophe pivotal. Neither the moral nor the literary disputes were ventilated in such terms. Compared to Holden'sfar more pronounced resistance to maturation, compared to more immediate targets of his scorn, the Bomb hardlyregistered as a concern among objections to the novel. But if "the essence of censorship," according to Lippmann, is "not to suppress subversive ideas as such, but towithhold them from those who are young or unprivileged or otherwise undependable,"55 then Steinle's emphasisupon parental assertion of authority is not misplaced. In a more class-conscious society, the Old Bailey prosecutor ofthe publisher of Lady Chatterley's Lover could ask in his opening address to the jury, in 1960: "Is it a book that youwould even wish your wife or your servants to read?"56 But in the United States, overt conflicts are more likely totake generational form; and the first of Lippmann's categories deserves to be highlighted. Some of the books thathave aroused the greatest ire place children at the center, like Richard Wright's Black Boy, Anne Frank's Diary of aYoung Girl, and of course The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn; and despite the aura of "cuteness" hovering overSalinger's work, it emitted danger by striking at the most vulnerable spot in the hearts of parents. Nor could it haveescaped the attention of alert readers that Holden's emotional affiliations are horizontal rather than vertical. His father,a corporate lawyer, is absent from the scene; and his mother is present only as a voice speaking from a dark room.The only relative whom the reader meets is Phoebe, the younger sister (and a mini-Holden).57 The contributor's note Salinger submitted to Harper's in 1946 was his credo: "I almost always write about veryyoung people";58 and the directness with which he spoke to them had much to do with his appeal-and with theanxiety that his literary intervention provoked in the internecine battle between generations. The effectiveness of hisempathy posed a challenge to parents who invoked their right to be custodians of the curriculum, and the "legions ofdecency" may have sensed "a unique seductive power" which Salinger's biographer claims The Catcher in the Ryeexudes. Even if the less sensitive or eccentric of its young readers might not try to assume Holden's persona, at leastteenagers could imitate his lingo. A book that elicits such proprietary interest-succeeding cohorts believing in aspecial access to Salinger's meaning-was bound to arouse some suspicion that conventional authority was beingoutflanked.59 Salinger's adroit fidelity to the feelings and experiences of his protagonist was what made the novel sotempting a target. Perhaps The Catcher in the Rye has been banned precisely because it is so cherished; because it isso easily loved, some citizens love to hate it. Steinle has closely examined the local controversies that erupted over the book in Alabama, Virginia, New Mexico,and California as well as the debates conducted in such publications as the PTA Magazine and the Newsletter onIntellectual Freedom of the American Library Association. She discovered a "division . . . over whether to prepareadolescents for or to protect them from adult disillusionment. . . . In the postwar period . . . recognition of theincreasing dissonance between American ideals and the realities of social experience has become unavoidable, and it isprecisely this cultural dissonance that is highlighted by Salinger's novel."60 Its literary value got lost in theassertion of family values, in a campaign that must be classified as reactionary. "They say it describes reality," aparent in Boron, California, announced. "I say let's back up from reality. Let's go backwards. Let's go back to whenwe didn't have an immoral society."61 When so idyllic a state existed was not specified, but what is evident is theelement of anti-intellectualism that the struggle against permissiveness entailed. Here some of the parents werejoined by Leonard Hall, the school superintendent of Bay County, Florida, who warned in 1987 against assigningbooks that were not state-approved because, he sagely opined, reading "is where you get ideas from."62 Attempts at vindication were occasionally made on the same playing field that censors themselves chose. ThoughHolden labels himself "sort of an atheist" (p. 130), he could be praised as a saint, if admittedly a picaresque one. Oneeducator discerned in the protagonist a diamond in the rough: "He befriends the friendless. He respects those who arehumble, loyal, and kind. He demonstrates a strong love for his family" (or for Phoebe anyway). Besides enactingsuch New Testament teachings, "he abhors hypocrisy. He values sex that comes from caring for another person andrejects its sordidness. And, finally, he wants to be a responsible member of society, to guide and protect thoseyounger than he."63 But a character witness is not the same as a literary critic, and such conflation seems to havegained little traction when the right of English teachers to make up reading lists was contested. If Holden's defenserested on a sanitized version of his character, then the implication was that assigned books with less morallymeritorious protagonists might be subject to parental veto. Such a defense also assumed that disgruntled parents werethemselves exegetes who had simply misread a text, that community conflicts could be resolved by more subtleinterpretations. There is no reason to believe, however, that the towns where the novel was banned or challengedoverlapped with maps of misreading. But such communities were places where parents tried to gain control of thecurriculum, which is why The Catcher in the Rye would still have been proscribed even had it been re-read as a bookof virtues. For the objections that were most frequently raised were directed at the novelist's apparent desire to capture profuseadolescent profanity in the worst way. In the Catholic World, reviewer Riley Hughes disliked the narrator's"excessive use of amateur swearing and coarse language," which made his character simply "monotonous."64According to one angry parent's tabulation, 237 instances of "goddamn," 58 uses of the synonym for a person ofillegitimate birth, 31 "Chrissakes," and one incident of flatulence constituted what was wrong with Salinger's book.Though blasphemy is not a crime, The Catcher in the Rye "uses the Lord's name in vain two hundred times," anopponent in Boron asserted-"enough [times] to ban it right there."65 The statistics are admittedly not consistent. Butit is incontestable that the text contains six examples of "fuck" or "fuck you," though here Holden is actually alliedwith the censorious parents, since he does not swear with this four-letter word himself but instead tries to efface itfrom walls. He's indignant that children should be subjected to such graffiti. Upon seeing the word even in theEgyptian tomb room at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, however, Holden achieves a melancholy and matureinsight that such offenses to dignity cannot really be expunged from the world: "You can't ever find a place that'snice and peaceful, because there isn't any" (p. 264).66 What happened to The Catcher in the Rye wasn't always nice and peaceful because it took a linguistic turn. Thoughhistorians are fond of defining virtually every era as one of transition, it does make sense to locate the publication ofSalinger's novel on the cusp of change. The novel benefited from the loosening of tongues that the Second WorldWar sanctioned, yet the profanity in which Holden indulges still looked conspicuous before the 1960s. Salinger thushelped to accelerate the trend toward greater freedom for writers but found himself the target of those offended by theadolescent vernacular still rarely enough recorded in print. During the Second World War, the Production Code hadbeen slightly relaxed for We Are the Marines. This 1943 March of Time documentary was permitted to use mildexpletives like "damn" "under stress of battle conditions." Professor Thomas Doherty adds that, "in the most ridiculedexample of the Code's tender ears, Noel Coward's In Which We Serve (1942), a British import, was held up fromAmerican release for seventeen words: ten 'damns,' two 'hells,' two 'Gods,' two 'bastards,' and one 'lousy."' Only three years before publication of Salinger's novel, homophonic language was inserted into Norman Mailer'sThe Naked and the Dead at the suggestion of his cousin, Charles Rembar. A crackerjack First Amendment attorneywho would later represent such clients as Fanny Hill and Constance Chatterley, Rembar proposed the substitution offug (as in "Fug you. Fug the goddam gun") partly because the president of the house publishing the novel feared hisown mother's reaction. The U.S. Information Agency was nevertheless unpersuaded and banned Mailer's book fromits overseas libraries. As late as 1952, the revised edition of Webster's Unabridged offered a simple but opaquedefinition of masturbation as "onanism; selfpollution."67 The next year President Eisenhower delivered a celebratedplea at Dartmouth College: "Don't join the bookburners.... Don't be afraid to go into your library and read everybook." His amendment is less cited-"as long as that document does not offend our own ideas of decency." Though thewar in which Mailer and Salinger fought allowed some indecorous terms to go public, the 1960 Presidential debatesincluded the spectacle of Nixon seeking to trump another ex-sailor by promising the electorate-after Harry Truman'ssalty lapsesto continue Ike's restoration of "decency and, frankly, good language" in the White House.68 In this particular war of words, Salinger was conscripted into a cause for which he was no more suited than anyother. If he was affiliated with any institution at all, it was the New Yorker, which initially published most of hisNine Stories as well as the substance of his two subsequent books. In that magazine even the mildest profanity wasstrictly forbidden, and editorial prudishness would have spiked publication of excerpts from the final version of whatbecame his most admired work. It may be plausible, as one scholar circling the text has noted, that "the radical natureof Salinger's portrayal of disappointment with American society, so much like Twain's in Huck Finn, was probablyas much of the reason that Catcher (like Huck) was banned from schools and colleges as were the few curse wordsaround which the battle was publicly fought."69 But such ideological objections to Salinger's novel were rarelyraised, much less articulated with any cogency; and therefore no historian of the reception of this book shouldminimize the salience of those "few curse words." Could The Catcher in the Rye have avoided the turbulent pool into which it was so often sucked? Could the novelhave been rescued from primitive detractors and retained an even more secure status in the public school curriculum?One compromise was never c

COURSE STRUCTURE  
This course consists of BOTH lecture and student discussion.  Students shall
come to class every day having completed the assigned readings ready to both
listen to the material presented and discuss the readings.

ATTENDANCE  
Because exams will cover material in the lectures and discussions as well as
readings, attendance at all classes is HIGHLY recommended in order to receive
a satisfactory grade on the exams. ATTENDANCE ON THE DAYS IN WHICH DEBATES ARE
SCHEDULED IS **_MANDATORY_**   (please check the syllabus schedule below for
these dates). Students who do not attend class on these days will not be
allowed to turn in the essay or questions based on a debate in which they did
not participate.

GRADING:  Each student's grade will be determined as follows:  
30%     2 Tests  
25%     Final  
20%     Online Quizzes  
20%     Debate Paper  
 5%      Debate Questions

TESTS:  There will be three in-class essay exams, including the final exam.
Each exam will test the material in the section since the previous exam AND
the major themes developed throughout the entire semester.  The dates of these
exams are indicated on the syllabus below.

There will also be 16 Online Quizzes.  These may be taken by the student at
any time after the quiz is made available on WebCt, as long as they are
completed BEFORE the class period on the date indicated on the syllabus below.
Information on how to access WebCt and set up a student account in order to
take the quizzes will be handed out separately.  The address for Henderson
WebCt is <http://webct.hsu.edu:8900>

DEBATES:  There will be three simulated debates during the course of this
semester.  Each student will represent a historical character in ONE debate.
The paper prepared for the debate will count as 20% of a student's overall
grade.  Each student will also act as a "journalist" and prepare questions to
ask of historical characters in two other debates. The last page of this
syllabus discusses the requirements for the debate and the written assignments
in more detail.

SIMULATED DEBATES

 There will be three simulated debates during the course of this semester.
Each student will participate in one debate and ask questions during two
others.  Participants and journalists both have roles and assignments
connected with these debates.  The debates are simulations in the sense that
such debates with such characters never actually took place.  However, the
participants in the debate should research their character and endeavor to act
as closely as possible to the way their historical character WOULD have acted
if such a debate had taken place.

 ASSIGNMENTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF PARTICIPANTS

**Historical Figures  
** Written assignment DUE the DAY of the simulated debate:  One **three-page
typed paper** on the historical figure assigned.   The thesis of this paper
will be why the historical figure does or does not agree with the question
being debated.  All information in the paper, therefore, must tie into this
thesis.  For every historical figure assigned, there will be a primary
document available through WebCt that will give basics of that person's
opinion on the issue.  Further research will need to be done either in the
library or on the internet to complete the paper.  The paper may  include the
historical person's life, character, and the historical context which formed
this person's opinion **IF** it is helpful in understanding why the character
felt the way he/she does.  Students may turn in rough drafts of their papers
two or three class periods in advance of the debate.  I will read the rough
draft and make suggestions for improvements if necessary.  Further suggestions
for writing the paper are at the [debate index.](../Debates/debateindex.htm)

Debate assignment:  The day of the debate, each student representing a
historical figure will have up to two minutes to introduce him or herself.
This introduction should include his/her occupation or position in government
and a brief biography, IF APPROPRIATE.  **Most importantly** in this
introduction, **explain** his or her position on the question in debate.
Each student should also be prepared to answer questions about their position
posed by "journalists."

**NOTE ON PLAGIARISM: If more than six words are used from ANY source
(including the internet) in a paper, then they must be placed in quotation
marks and the source cited.   Papers should be written entirely in a student's
own words with only _limited_ quotes used when necessary.   Plagiarism (using
someone else's work or part of work as your own) is a very serious infraction.
It will absolutely result in a zero for the paper, and I further reserve the
right to give a failing course grade to any student who plagiarizes as well as
take appropriate actions with Henderson University disciplinary committees.
**

**Journalists**  
Written assignment:   DUE ONE CLASS PERIOD before the debate.  Each
"journalist" should prepare two to three questions to ask of the historical
characters.  At least one question will be directed specifically to a
particular historical figure (chosen in advance), while the other questions
should be broad questions for all the debaters or for one side.  The questions
should be framed so that the answer will illuminate the issues involved in the
debate.  The questions MUST ask for more specific information than the larger
question being debated.

Debate assignment:  The journalists will take turns asking their questions of
the debaters.  Each journalist should be prepared with follow-up questions if
the question does not elicit the type of information the original question
sought.

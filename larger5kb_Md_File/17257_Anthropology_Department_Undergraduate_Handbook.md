# INTRODUCTION

  
  
    The Anthropology Department at Penn is embarking upon an exciting new experiment I'd like to tell you about. We are developing an innovative undergraduate program around the theme of "Anthropology and the Modern World." 

Too many people think of athropology as only about digging up the remains of
an ancient past or traveling to for-away places to study exotic peoples and
customs. Yes, we do all that, But we do much, much more.

Did you know, to take just one example, the the Intel Corporation has hired a
team of anthropologists to conduct research in the area of "design
ethnography," figuring out how people use electronic equipment in their daily
lives in order to more intellegently design new technologies? Corporations
today are discovering the relevance of anthropology to doing business, and
this is one area in which you can be in the vangaurd.

Did you know that anthropologists work as forensic experts, identifying people
from physical remains or even convenience store viedo images where the lay
person has no idea? Did you know that we work in places like the offices of
plastic surgeons, investigating how culture constructs the ideal body and
sells it to eager consumers?

Once you know what culture history teaches us about the cultural backgroud to
contemporary countries like Afghanistan- and events unfold around us even as I
write- you will appreciate how shallow is the mass media coverage, how much
richer and multi-dimensianal your understanding of present-day realities can
be.

Our goal is to develop a series of dymanic new classes for undergraduates that
will inform you about the relevance of anthropological research and methods to
business, to medicine, to current events- in short, to the contemporary world.

This spring we launch several new courses- "Witchcraft in the Modern World,"
"The Medical Anthropology of Alcohol Use," "The Information Age: Culture,
Technology, and Economics," and "Doctor-Patient Communication." And we have
more planed for next year, including "Anthropology and Business,"
"Anthropology and the Media," and a comprehensive world survey: "Cultural
Background to the Modern World."

We will continue our traditional rigorous training for majors. However, we
believe that every informed citizen should, indeed must, know something about
the cultural dimensions of the present world in order to make sense of what is
going on today. Whether you plan to go into business, government, medicine,
law, or just about any other profession, a background in anthropology will
serve you well.

So I want to welcome you, majors and non-majors alike, to join us in this new
adventure, as we endeavor to bring anthropological scholarship into contact
with the hurly burly of a fast-paced, high-powered modern world.

Sincerely yours,

Dr. Greg Urban  
Professor  
Chair of Anthropology Department, University of Pennsylvania

# MAJOR REQUIREMENTS*

  
  
    To declare anthropology as your major, you must schedule an appointment with Larysa Carr, the Undergraduate Secretary, to meet with the Undergraduate Chair, Dr. Melvyn Hammarberg. To schedule the appointment, go to room 325 University Museum, phone 215-898-7461, or email [Larysa Carr.](mailto:lcarr@sas.upenn.edu)

    The Anthropology major consists of 14 credits. For those not specializing in Human Biology: the requirements are 001, 002, 003, plus one 100+ level course in each of physical anthropology and archaeology, and two 100+ level courses in cultural/linguistics. The other seven units may be taken from one or any combination of these, though you are encouraged to take as many as possible in all three fields. You also should consider taking statistics as well as a course in research methods appropriate to your field of concentration. A maximum of three non-anthropology courses (and those not already cross-listed with anthropology) can be applied to the major with the approval of the Undergraduate Chair. A list is available in the Anthropology Department office room 325 of the Museum.

# GRADUATING WITH HONORS

    In order to graduate with honors from the Anthropology Department you must have a G.P.A. status of 3.5 for all courses applied to your major. You must also complete Anthropology 300 or 301 (a two semester thesis), in which you prepare a senior thesis with the aid of a faculty advisor. The senior thesis marks completion of a significant piece of original research, from formulation of the problem or question, through analysis and write-up. The more lead time you allow, the better prepared you and the faculty supervisor will be to make the most of the thesis period.     The Anthropology Thesis Prize is awarded to the best senior thesis in Anthropology at Penn in a given year. In order to be considered for this competition, your thesis must be submitted in final and complete form by early to mid April. The prize is awarded on advice of an Anthropology faculty committee, who read all the submitted theses. The prizewinner is notified by the end of the term, and at the department's graduation reception in May, is given a certificate and a small honorarium. In addition, the awardee's name is inscribed on a plaque in the Anthropology Department and printed in the University's commencement program.     For Any Information Regarding The Anthropology Deparment, Please Contact [Larysa Carr](mailto:lcarr@sas.upenn.edu), Room 325 Univerity Musuem, Phone (215) 898-7461.

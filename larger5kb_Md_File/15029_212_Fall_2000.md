Course Description and Objectives  
The second in a four-course sequence in Western Civilization, this course is
an introduction to the history of Europe and Europe's colonies (particularly
British North America) during the early modern era. The purpose of the Western
Civilization sequence is to provide students of history and the liberal arts
with a solid foundation in the principal ideas, institutions, and events that
have shaped Western civilization. It seeks to promote an understanding of
historical context and perspective and to encourage the skills essential to
historical inquiry, including the capacity to define historical questions,
analyze primary documents, evaluate alternative interpretations, develop
coherent arguments, and write clearly and effectively.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  
  

Exams will consist of short-answer questions and large essay questions. Each
of the three exams will cover roughly one-third of the course; the third exam
will also include a comprehensive section.

2\. A research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 25%
for the second)  
  

The research paper can be on any topic in Western Civilization during the
early modern era. Papers are to be analytical and interpretive; they should
present a thesis and develop an argument. You are encouraged to use primary
sources, and you are expected to examine the historiographical context of your
topic.

First drafts may be limited to sources available in the Duggan Library, but
you are expected to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional sources for the
final draft. You should include with your first draft a bibliography based on
a universal search for sources. The [Electronic
Database](http://history.hanover.edu/data.html) page  on the History Web Site
may prove helpful in bibliographical searches.

The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of the thesis and
argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the quality of the
writing. You should consult with me about your paper at least a week before
each draft is due.

3\. Class participation (10%)  
  

The success of this class, as a small seminar, depends upon the quality of the
dialogue in class. It is expected that you will attend every class and that
you will be fully prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day.
Class participation grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency
of your contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

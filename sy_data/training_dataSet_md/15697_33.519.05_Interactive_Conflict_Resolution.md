**33.519.05   Interactive Conflict Resolution

Course Syllabus  Fall, 1998



**_Instructor_ : Dr. Ronald J. Fisher, Visiting Professor

_Time_ : Wed., 11:20 AM to 2:00 PM.

_Office_ : Room 228B, Asbury Building; Tel: 202 885 1764

_Office Hours_ : TBA in consultation with class members

_Course Description_ :

This course will provide an in-depth coverage of the emerging field of
Interactive Conflict Resolution (ICR) defined as small group, problem solving
discussions between unofficial representatives of identity groups or states
engaged in destructive conflict that are facilitated by an impartial third
party of scholar-practitioners.  The course will explicate the history of the
field and present an overview of current applications focusing on violent and
apparently intractable intercommunal conflicts with international
ramifications.  Various forms of ICR (dialogue, conflict analysis,
reconciliation) will be discussed along with critical issues (training,
funding, institutionalization) that are shaping the future of the field.  In
addition to readings and seminar discussions, class members will engage in a
series of analytical exercises designed to illustrate the challenges of
practice in ICR.

_Course Design_ :

This class is a graduate seminar in which members are expected to participate
actively, both in presenting assigned readings and engaging in the discussions
and exercises that build on the readings.  Each session will cover a
designated topic based on a set of readings and will engage two members as
'Reading Partners' working as co-presenters in bringing forward some of the
basic ideas and themes in the readings.  The objective in the ensuing
discussion is not only to identify the learnings in the readings, but also for
each class member to develop personal meaning of the material through active
participation.

To further our understanding of ICR, class members will also form small
'Intervention Teams' based on common interests and aspirations.  These teams
will complete the analytical exercises provided in Mitchell & Banks (1996) and
present selected portions of their work to the rest of the class.
Simultaneous completion of the exercises by a number of teams will allow for
the discussion of similarities and differences in approach, strategies and
tactics.  The objective is to add greater meaning to the readings through a
sequenced analysis of the types of situations, challenges and dilemmas that
are faced by scholar-practitioners of ICR.

Both the Reading Partners and the Intervention Teams will be formed with
flexibility in the amount of collaboration that will be necessary, in order to
take account of members' constraints in terms of study and work schedules,
geographical location, transportation requirements, etc.  In concert with the
Reading Partners and Intervention Teams, more traditional elements of the
design will include a term paper and a take home exam.

_Course Requirements_ :

1\. Class Participation (15%):  Evaluation of participation will be based
primarily on the presentations of the readings undertaken by the Reading
Partners, who are expected to consult with each other and discuss how to
present the main ideas in their set of readings to the class.  Members will
choose their Reading Partner early in the class, and will make one or two
presentations during the term depending on the number in the class.  Feedback
from the Instructor will be given following the class session.  This component
of participation is worth 10% of the grade, and will be assigned to the
Reading Partners as a unit.  The remaining 5% will be assigned individually
and will be based on attendance, in that 1/2% will be deducted from the final
mark for each session missed without a medical or compassionate reason being
provided.

2\. Intervention Team Exercises (30%):  Each Intervention Team will complete a
number of analyses and will make several presentations during the term.  This
sequential and collaborative endeavor is designed to sensitize members to the
challenges and benefits of working in a professional intervention team, and to
deepen members understanding of the course material by application to concrete
situations.  Brief written reports on the exercises will be required
throughout the course, and the grade will be based on the combination of the
reports and the presentations.  The mark will be assigned to the Learning Team
as a unit, unless members negotiate to take individual marks based on selected
components of the exercises and reports.  The Instructor will provide
additional guidance for the completion of the exercises in Mitchell & Banks
where required.

3\. Term Paper (25%):  A traditional research and analysis paper of 20 to 25
pages is to be completed by each class member.  The topic should relate to and
build on some segment of the class readings, and should not overlap with the
Intervention Team exercises and reports.  Topics should be identified in
consultation with the Instructor with the goal of advancing the professional
development of the class member.

4\. Final Exam (30%):  A take home final exam will be used to assess class
members' comprehension of and ability to apply the ideas represented in the
class readings and discussions.  The exam will consist of four essay questions
of which three must be completed within a designated number of pages.  The
exam will be due the last week of the term and class members will have one
week to complete it.

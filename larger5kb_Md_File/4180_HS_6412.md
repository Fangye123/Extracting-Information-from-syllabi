_Course description_



The late nineteenth century witnessed Britain's zenith as a world power, owing
both to its economic preeminence and its vast imperial holdings.  Subsequent
years, however, revealed the decline of industrial Britain (at least in
relation to new competitors) and the break-up of the British empire.  At the
same time, Britain made great strides in establishing a stable democracy,
accommodating the claims of its people to social as well as political justice.
Much of this was done under pressure from the economic and political crises of
the twentieth century -- wars and depressions.  We conclude, however, with an
examination of Mrs. Thatcher's England, where a most remarkable thing took
place.  Many of the reforms and trends which will demand our attention
throughout most of the course are now in the process of being reversed.  What
are the social costs of the Thatcher revolution and how durable will be its
legacy, especially now when the "Iron Lady" has been ejected from the stage?



_Course requirements_



You are required to write three historiographical essays (7-10 pages each),
due on March 2, April 6, and May 11.  You will choose from among a list of
topics appended at the end of the syllabus.  These essays should be based on a
carefully selected bibliography of no more than a dozen works (books and
articles) or so, depending on the topic  Don't use the first twelve works you
identify; rather, consider only the most useful and significant.  The essay
should consist of three parts:  first, identify the historiographical
significance of the topic; second, review the relevant literature; and, third,
assess the status of the discussion (what questions have been satisfactorily
answered, what further research is needed, etc.)  You may have to read your
essay in class.  Each paper will account for 25% of your final grade, though
these proportions can change to reward improvement from one essay to the next.
Class participation will account for the final 25% of your grade.

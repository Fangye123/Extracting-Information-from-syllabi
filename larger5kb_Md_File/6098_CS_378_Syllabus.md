### Syllabus - CS 378/398T  
Topics in Computer Science Education

### Spring 2002  
  
---  
  
### Course Overview

The purpose of this course is to explore the process of teaching as applied to
the field of Computer Science.  By the end of the session you will have some
of the basic terminology, theory and applications with which we talk about
college teaching and learning.  You will also have had practice in thinking
through some of the issues surrounding teaching today and in getting up in
front of a class and actually teaching.

A major component of this course will be acting as a Section Leader in the [
Undergraduate Section Leader](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/scottm/USL.htm)
program. As part of this  program you will be fully responsible for a weekly
mentoring session, grading, and lab help for approximately 10 students in the
CS 307 course. You will get to know these students very well. The students
will not have a formal discussion section led by a graduate student. You will
be in charge of helping these students learn the material with the assistance
of a lead TA and the course instructor.

#### Writing

Another goal of this course is to help you learn to write clearly and cogently
using correct grammar, style, spelling and punctuation. The content of your
writing is also important. I will expect your writing to express original
thought and, in the case of your term paper, to present the results of
original research, rather than simple summaries of the materials you read.

|  | 2. | technical aspects  
|  |  | a. | grammar and style (I have provided a [list of

|  |  |  | 1) | list of common problems (these are not exclusive)  
|  |  |  |  | a) | [colloquial or "conversational" style](links/colloq.htm)  
|  |  |  |  | b) | [use of the passive voice](links/passive.htm)

|  |  |  | 2) | suggestions  
|  |  |  |  | a) | read Strunk's _[Elements of
Style](http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html)_ , preferably over and over
again as long as you live  
|  |  |  |  | b) | use a grammar checker, but use it intelligently  
|  |  |  |  | c) | if you are in doubt about your grammar, consult a book such
as _Elements of Style_ or another standard English grammar text or ask someone
to proof-read your work  
|  |  |  b. | Spelling and punctuation _must_ be correct. Use a spelling
checker to help you, but use it intelligently. A dictionary is always the
final arbitrator for questions of spelling.  
|  |  3. | content  
|  |  | a. | papers must be based on [bibliographic-style
references](http://healthlinks.washington.edu/hsl/styleguides/chicago.html)

Other reference guides:  
[Duke Guide to Library Research](http://www.lib.duke.edu/libguide/citing.htm)

[Karla's Guide to Citation
Styles](http://bailiwick.lib.uiowa.edu/journalism/cite.html)  
  
|  | 2. | Select your essay topic to coincide with one of the chapters we
cover between the due date of the last short essay assignment and the due date
for the current essay.  
|  | 3. | Keep [direct quotes](links/quotes.htm) as short as possible.  
|  | 4. | [Cite your sources](links/sources.htm) in the body of the essay as
well as in your list of references.  
|  | 5. | At least two essays must include substantial technical information.  
|  | 6. | Your essay should be between 2 1/2 - 3 pages long, not including
space taken by references.  
| C. | **Term paper** **(Due: 29 April 2002)**  
|  |  1. | Besides standard library research (e.g., references from books,
articles, newspapers, etc.), you will need to do some kind of original
research. Exactly what this should be will depend on the topic you select, but
it may consist of such things as polls, interviews, analysis of a number of
related Web pages or other primary documents.  
|  | 2. | The topic is entirely of your choice, although it should relate to
the issues we discuss in class. If you have an idea for another topic, you
will need to get prior approval.  
|  | 3. | Your term paper should be between 7-9 pages, not including space
taken by references  
|   | 4. | You will complete your term paper in phases, each of which has its
own due date (see the schedule for details)  
|  |  | a. | [Topic selection](term_topic.htm): this should specify the
subject, the kinds of research you expect to perform and a rough outline of
the issues you plan to cover  
|  |  | b. | [Formal Outline](term_outline.htm)  
|  |  | c. | First draft (not handed in). Should flow easily from the outline.
Use this for feedback from the TA or the Lecturer.  
|  |  | d. | **Final draft**. There will be no opportunity to rewrite the term
paper after the due date for the final draft. If your first draft is fairly
complete, you should have enough feedback to do a good job. I also encourage
you to ask the TAs or me for help or advice as you are working on the paper.  
|    | 5. | Your term paper must include appropriate
[subtitles](links/tpformat.htm).  
II. | Class participation  
| A. | To ensure that you have prepared for class discussion and to encourage
attendance, I will periodically give short "pop" quizzes over the reading.  
| B. | Quality is as important as quantity and manners do count!  
| C. | Scoring for participation in small groups will consist partly of peer
and self-evaluation  
| D. | Participation will include out-of-class activities. Bringing in
relevant newspaper or magazine articles or references to other current news
sources is particularly important.

## General Policies

Besides the grading policies in the preceding section, there are a few more
rules for this course.

We will not accept late work without a valid documented excuse. Makeup exams
and quizzes will not be given under any circumstances, but under exceptional
conditions, other arrangements may be made.

If you are dissatisfied with a grade you receive, you must **submit your
complaint in writing** along with supporting evidence or arguments. We must
receive this protest **within one week of the date on which we first attempt
to return the assignment** to you. We will not consider any grade change
request that does not fulfill this requirement.

Turning in an exam which is not entirely your own work is cheating. Turning in
a programming assignment which is not entirely your own work (or your group's
work, as per the assignment) is cheating. **Group discussion about course
content is not cheating, and it is strongly encouraged.** Students who violate
University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to disciplinary
penalties, including the possibility of a lowered or 0 grade on an assignment
or exam, failure in the course, and/or dismissal from the University.
Representing the work of others as your own will be considered academic
dishonesty and will not be tolerated. Since such dishonesty harms the
individual, all students, and the integrity of the University, policies on
scholastic dishonesty will be strictly enforced.  
  
At the beginning of the semester, students with disabilities who need special
accommodations should notify the instructor by presenting a letter prepared by
the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) Office. To ensure that the
most appropriate accommodations can be provided, students should contact the
SSD Office at 471-6259 or 471-4641 TTY.

A student who is absent from an examination or cannot meet an assignment
deadline due to the observance of a religious holy day may take the
examination on an alternate day, submit the assignment up to 24 hours late
without penalty, or be excused from the examination or assignment, if proper
notice of the planned absence has been given. Notice must be given at least
fourteen days prior to the classes scheduled on dates the student will be
absent. For religious holy days that fall within the first two weeks of the
semester, notice should be given on the first day of the semester. It must be
personally delivered to the instructor and signed and dated by the instructor,
or sent certified mail, return receipt requested. Email notification will be
accepted if received, but a student submitting such notification must receive
email confirmation from the instructor. A student who fails to complete missed
work within the time allowed will be subject to the normal academic penalties.

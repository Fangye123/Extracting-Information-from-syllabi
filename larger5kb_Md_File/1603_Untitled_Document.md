**EUROPEAN INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL HISTORY:  
  
THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, 1880-1918**  
  
__Description  
__  
The turn of the century - roughly the years between 1880 and 1918 \- bridged
two worlds: nineteenth-century Europe, an era of confidence in science,
progress and the forward march of prosperity and human rights, and the
twentieth century, a period marked by the enormous destruction of two world
wars, the looming threat of nuclear annihilation and unprecedented, genocidal
barbarism. The transitional years in between represented a period of
tremendous cultural achievement, giving birth to many of the movements, ideas
and styles which continue to shape our world: psychoanalysis and modern
psychology; feminism and sexual liberation; and modernism in literature and
art are all products of these tumultuous years, for example. At the same time,
these years were characterized by deep anxiety and unrest. Amid a series of
political crises and sharpening social antagonisms, Europeans saw the
emergence of ideas such as futurism, imperialism,  "racial science" and anti-
Semitism, ideas which contributed to the rise of fascism between the wars and
the murderous racism of the Nazi Holocaust.  
  
In this course we will survey the cultural and intellectual developments of
these frenetic decades. We will do this through close readings of contemporary
writings (literature, philosophy, psychology, social criticism) and with the
help of two historical treatments of the period, one a classic (Schorske) and
the other very recent (Schwartz). We will be asking such questions as: what
common themes emerge in the works of this varied set of writers? How can one
compare the different sites of cultural ferment (Vienna and Paris, e.g.)? What
was the relationship between developments in European politics and society and
these cultural movements? On another level we will be asking broader, self-
reflective questions about our material and methods of interpretation, such as
how do historians conceive of culture (and cultural history)?  
  
  
__Course Requirements__  
  
Class time will consist almost entirely of discussion, except for the
occasional brief, introductory lecture, so the most important requirement is
that you come to class prepared to participate. If you will be unable to
attend a class, please let me know in advance.  
  
Note: this syllabus is subject to change. Changes will be announced in class
and on the course web site (which should be up any day now.) It is your
responsibility to keep informed of any changes, whether or not you were in
class when the change was announced. Not being aware of a reading assignment
does not constitute an acceptable excuse for being unprepared in class. You
should also expect the occasional unanounced in-class writing assignment,
which I will inflict upon you several times over the course of the semester
and which will count in your grade for class participation (see below).  
  
The formal requirements consist of the following:  
  
o 3 Papers. two 4 - 6 pages and one 5 - 7 pages. [Due: October 7, November 16
and December 2]  
  
o Oral Presentation: The class will be divided into groups of two or three,
and each group will take responsibility for introducing the readings and
raising discussion questions on a designated day.  
  
o A comprehensive final exam, consisting of short answer and essay questions.
[Thursday, December 16, 2-4 PM]

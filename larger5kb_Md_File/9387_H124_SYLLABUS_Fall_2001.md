The continuing violence in Israel and Palestine is often explained as the
result of irrational, ancient hatreds rather than the result of modern forces
open to critical understanding.  This course counters the irrationalist
explanation by introducing students to conflicting interpretations of the
international, social, and cultural history of the Palestinian/Israeli
conflict.  It surveys the theory and practice of Zionism and Palestinian
nationalism within an international system defined by the collapse of Turkey,
the rise and fall of Britain, and the Cold War between the US and USSR.
Special attention will be paid to US ideology and regional hegemony.  Given
the contentious, often polemical nature of the historical discussion about
Palestine and Israel, students will need to critically evaluate competing
arguments to come to their own understanding of this difficult history.

Course Description  
---  
Economic, social, intellectual and political development of multicultural
California. Survey of Indian, Spanish and Mexican periods. Analysis of role
and issues of ethnic/racial minorities during six major historical periods:
gold rush, railroad era, Great Depression, World War II, turbulent '60s and
present era. Includes field trips, cultural events, film and book reviews.  
  
**HIST-010: Course meets University of California, Berkeley's American
Cultures and Foothill College's Multicultural requirement.**  
  
Objectives of the course  
The course is composed of two major parts: 1) Historical Analysis and 2),
Cultural Enrichment.  
  
The **Historical Analysis** component is divided into two sections. The first
section examines the unique culture of the Native American, Spanish, Mexican,
and Anglo American groups and the role they played in the historical
development of present day California. We study each group's social, economic
and political institutions, their cultural legacies, and their ethnic/racial
interactions. We compare differences and similarities within cultural groups,
as well as differences and similarities across cultures.  
  
Section two will cover six major historical periods:  
  
1\. Gold Rush  
2\. Railroad era  
3\. The Great Depression  
4\. World War 11  
5\. The Turbulent 60's  
6\. Multicultural California today.  
  
In examining these major periods an overview of the social, economic, and
political trends manifested by the dominant society during each period of
time, will serve as a background to analyze its prevalent racial/ethnic
attitudes as well as inter-group relations. For example, during the Gold Rush
era we will discuss the general characteristics of this period, the make up of
the population and their values and ideas in relation to race and ethnic
relations.  
  
The **Cultural Enrichment** component allows students an opportunity to
experience historical periods of California interactively instead of in a
lecture format. Students are encouraged to select historical landmarks,
cultural events, and other activities that they find personally interesting.
This component gives students the opportunity to explore the history of
California within the realm of their own interests.

I encourage students to select activities that they enjoy so that the
classroom learning is more relevant to their own personal experiences. My only
other suggestion is that you begin with these activities immediately versus
waiting until the end of the quarter. Fulfilling this component early in the
quarter adds to the scheduled lectures and to the class discussions, which are
a significant part of your grade. Taking the opportunity to expand the course
syllabus and apply student learning to a real world context will make the
course more interesting for all of us.  
  
  
Expected outcomes  
The format for this class was designed with the specific purpose of providing
students with a wide variety of learning opportunities and, exposing them to
various teaching methods. Hopefully, this will help them acquire the
intellectual tools necessary to understand the complex issues surrounding
ethnic and racial conflicts in California history. Second, to help them
understand and described the sources of prejudice and discrimination and its
impact not only on minority groups but the society as a whole. And ultimately,
to provide students with an array of out of class activities that will broaden
the student's awareness, appreciation, and understanding of the rich cultural
background of the various ethnic and racial groups of California.  
  
  
Textbook(s)  
**Required:**

  * Rawls, James J. and Bean, Walton: [California: An interpretative History.](http://books.fhda.edu/taweb/tawhtml/index5.HTML) McGraw Hill, 8th edition, 2002  
ISBN: 0-07-255255-7

  
  
Course Requirements  
  
  1. **Attendance:** Attendance to all class sessions is expected of all students. Formal daily roll-call is left at the discretion of the instructor; however, attendance is considered to be a very important part of the class, since participation will be heavily factored into the final course grade. Absences will only be excused in case of emergencies, but excessive (4 consecutive) absences will be grounds for the instructor to drop any student from the class. Arriving late to this class is discouraged especially when guest speakers or class discussions have been scheduled or films are being shown in class.  
  

  2. **Grades:** Your course grade will be determined according to the total points accumulated at the end of the quarter.  

> |  Exam 1 | 25  
> ---|---  
> Class participation | 50  
> Exam 2 | 25  
> Final exam | 50  
> Student Project | 150  
>  
>  300-270 | A  
> ---|---  
> 269-239 | B  
> 238-178 | C  
> 177-145 | D  
> 144- | F  
  
  3. **Exams:** All exams will be based on a combination of true-false and/or multiple choice questions, identification (of terms, people and events), and a short essay(s) format. For example, Exam 1 may have 10 multiple choice questions (or 5 m/ch and 5 t- f), 10 events/terms/people for identification, and one essay. Questions for the exams will be drawn from the lectures, the reading assignments, and the class discussions. A "Preparation Sheet" will be distributed in class one week before the exam. If you complete the "Preparation Sheet," have attended class regularly, have completed your readings in a timely manner, and have participated in lecture and discussion sessions you should do well in the exams.  
  

  4. **Make Up Exams:** A 20 point (2 essays) exam will be given on the first Thursday after the exam at 7:00 a.m. in my office 5999 #4. Please bring a blue book.  
  

  5. **Class participation:** There are five (5) formal discussion sessions which will usually take place on a Thursday. For these class discussion sessions the instructor will prepare a list of questions (3 or 4) which will be available in class a few days before the discussion session. You will be encouraged to present and defend your views. You will not be penalized for taking a stand opposite to that taken by the instructor or other students. You will be expected; however, to base your stand on facts and use as many examples as possible. The Instructor may also assign a film (viewed previously in class or to be viewed outside of the classroom) for a discussion session.  
  

  6. **Student Projects:** This requirement can be fulfilled by a variety and/or a combination of activities:  [Field Trips](projects.html#fieldtrips) |  There are 6 missions within a short distance from Foothill College: [San Carlos Borromeo del Rio Carmelo](http://www.carmelmission.org/), [San Jose](http://www.californiamissions.com/cahistory/sanjose.html), [Santa Cruz](http://users.dedot.com/mchs/missionscr.html), [Santa Clara de Asis](http://www.californiamissions.com/cahistory/santaclara.html), [San Francisco de Asis](http://missiondolores.citysearch.com/) and [San Juan Bautista](http://www.californiamissions.com/cahistory/sjbautista.html). Two Presidios: [San Francisco](http://www.nps.gov/prsf/) and [Monterey](http://www.monterey.org/museum/pom/), and a number of [historical landmarks](http://www.donaldlaird.com/landmarks/), [ excellent museums](http://www.123sanfrancisco.com/museums.htm) and nearby mining towns.

**NOTE:** The worth value for each of the above activities is 50 points each.  
  

  7. **Student Conduct:** As required by college policy. A copy of the Student Code of Honor is widely available throughout campus.  
  
I encourage you to consult the Foothill College Fall 2002 Schedule of Classes
on pages 155-156, for a description of specific examples of **academic
dishonesty** , such as PLAGIARISM, and their consequences. In this class you
will receive **zero** points on the respective assignment is you violate the
academic honor code. Two violations will carry an automatic **F** grade in the
course.  
  

  8. **Other:** In order to do well in this class you should do the following: 
    1. Familiarize yourself with the course syllabus.
    2. Attend class as scheduled. Students are still responsible for any material, information, announcements or other changes covered in class, even in the event of an absence.
    3. Arrive on time and avoid leaving early.
    4. Read assignments and handouts before the class period.
    5. Participate in class and discussion sessions.
    6. Complete all assignments on due date at the scheduled class time for full credit (late assignments--only within one week after due date--will receive half credit).
    7. Be respectful and courteous (no cell phones or pagers).
    8. One of my roles as the professor, is to ensure a positive classroom climate. It is at your risk if you are violating any of the syllabus guidelines. Please do not be surprised if I ask you to leave the classroom.

**NOTE: If you are experiencing problems with exams, class activities, grades,
etc., please talk to your instructor immediately. Any other action will not be
legitimized.**

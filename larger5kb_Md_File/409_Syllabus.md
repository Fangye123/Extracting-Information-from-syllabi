**Course Description**

Software engineering is the study of software process methods, in particular
the specification, design, implementation, testing, maintenance and
documentation of a software system. This course will will emphasize techniques
and notations essential to creating software systems based on the principles
discussed in ICS 121: well-understood requirements, logical object-oriented
design, module specification, well-planned testing, effective oral and written
communication of concepts, proper programming style, and group cooperation.
Prerequisites: ICS-121, ICS-141, and senior standing.

A central element in this course is the application of the software
engineering concepts in an ongoing, software development project. The project
will be worked on in teams.

In general, there will not be much lecturing in the class. A few lectures on
team coordination, management, etc. will be covered. In addition, the various
tools required for use in software production will be discussed. About half of
the time in lectures will be spent performing reviews of the artifacts
developed. The purpose of the discussion section is to ensure that you and
your team members will have at least two weekly time slots when you all can
meet. The TA will be setting up particular times during discussion sections
(or outside of, if necessary) to meet with each team weekly to discuss
problems and development issues.

**Prerequisites**

ICS 121 and 141

**Drop/Add Policy**

Since ICS 125B has a strong team project orientation, it is essential that the
drop/add process be terminated early. Therefore NO drops or adds will be
permitted after \dropdate, unless there are truly extenuating circumstances.  

**Required Texts**

Readings from the texts will be used to provide additional detail and
reference material.

  1. Schach, S. (1996). _Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering_ (Third Edition). Chicago, IL. Irwin. 
  2. Brooks, F. (1995). _The Mythical Man-Month_ (Anniversary Edition). Reading, MA. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. 
  3. Ghezzi, C., Jazayeri, M., & Mandrioli, D. (1991). _Fundamentals of Software Engineering_. Englewood Cliffs, NJ. Prentice Hall. 
  4. Sommerville, I. (1996). _Software Engineering_ (Fifth Edition). Reading, MA. Addison-Wesley Publishing Company. 
  5. Rumbaugh, et.al. _Object-Oriented Modeling and Design_. 

**Computer Usage**

Each team will be assigned an office in the Computer Science Trailer (CST). In
this office, there is a Sun for your team's use. In addition, Macintoshs and
PCs will be made available. You should use the platform most appropriate for
the task at hand.

You should use your UNIX accounts to access the bulletin board at least once a
day. The instructor and teaching assistant will post messages including
details of the assignments in this fashion. You will need to use email to
arrange office hours, etc.

**Communication and Office Hours**

Office hours, electronic mail addresses, and phone numbers appear on the first
page of this handout. Electronic mail is typically the best mean for asking
simple questions, since even if the addressee is out of town, they may be able
to answer your question promptly. In general, it is best to speak with the TAs
regarding assignments and with the instructor with respect to conceptual
information. If you feel you have extensive questions, be sure to make an
appointment with whomever you would like to talk. If you have a problem with
the grading of an assignment, speak with the TA first. If you need further
assistance, don't hesitate to contact the instructor.

**Project Description**![](../../../../~djr/www_images/new.gif)

As the primary component of the course is the development of a software
product, the best description of the course is to look at the [Project
Description](ics125/project.html), which also contains information about
assignments and grading criteria.

**Assessment**

The project is the focus of this course and will be assessed accordingly. Part
of your grade is also determined by individual assignments and team
participation. Your grade will be broken down as follows (percentages indicate
portion of total course grade):

**65% --** **Project Component** (apportioned according to participation)

**5% --**

     Deliverable 0 (Proposed Lifecycle Plan) 
**10% --** Deliverable 1 (Requirements: requirements specification and system
test plan)

**10% --** Deliverable 2 (UI/HCI: user interface specification, mockups and
HCI scenarios)

**10% --** Deliverable 3 (Design: OMT models and integration test plan

includes object, dynamic and functional models)

**10% --** Deliverable 4 (Implementation: unit code and test plans)

**10% --** Deliverable 5 (Integration and test history)

**10% --** Demonstration and Maintenance

**15% --** **Phased Personnel Component** (rotating organization)

**10% --** Management (see below)

**5% --**

     Clerical support (see below) 
**20% --** **Individual Component** (not team-related)

**9% --**

     Course Logs (one per week, see below) 
**5% --**

     Initial Essay
**6% --**

     Final Essay

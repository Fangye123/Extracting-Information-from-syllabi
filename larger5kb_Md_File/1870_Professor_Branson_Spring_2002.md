****Make a habit of checking the Web site for schedule changes and
announcements****

**Class Requirements**  

> 3 exams (Ex 1 15%, Ex 2 20%, Ex 3 25%) and 10 quizzes (total 40%)

**Format**

> This course consists of two lectures per week. Reading assignments for
lecture classes are listed below. Attendance, though not mandatory, will be
considered when I determine your final grade. I will know whether or not you
have been in class when you turn in a quiz (or fail to turn in a quiz).

**Quizzes**

> Quizzes will not be announced in advance. You are expected to do the
assigned readings, attend class, and pay attention and therefore pass each
quiz with flying colors. Quizzes may be administered at any time during class
- not necessarily at the beginning. Quizzes are short, and designed to ensure
you have done the reading and paid attention to lectures and videos. There are
no make-ups for quizzes. **Only your ten best quiz grades will be counted.**
Quiz answers will be posted on the web site shortly after you take a quiz.

**Exams**

> All make-up exams must be taken within one week of the scheduled exam or you
will automatically receive an F. There will be no make-up for the final exam:
if you cannot take it on the assigned day, you must take it in advance. The
date of the Final is already determined. You have plenty of time to plan
around conflicts, early departures, etc. An early exam will be administered on
Thursday May 2rd during class time.

**Procedure for discussing grades**

> Within one week of receiving your graded exam you should contact Ms. Steele.
If you still have questions, you may then come to me during office hours or
before or after class. Both Ms. Steele and myself reserve the right to deduct
points as well as possibly add points to your score.

**IMPORTANT: Completion of all required assignments is necessary for a passing
grade (i.e., failure to take one of the three exams or fewer than 5 quizzes is
not just a F averaged in, it is an F for the course). You are responsible for
knowing about any handouts or announcements. All information concerning this
course is posted on my web site. Please refer to it weekly to stay current on
assignment changes, handouts, or rescheduled exams.**

**Grading**

> Your grades for the course will be calculated on the four point scale listed
in the UTD Undergraduate catalog. For your convenience I have also put this on
the 1301 web site.

**Text**

> _**Major Problems in the History of American Workers**_ is the only book
required for this class. It contains essays and primary sources. You are
responsible for having read the assigned chapter by the time you get to class.
There are American history textbooks on reserve. You are expected to be
familiar with the chronology and main issues in American history. For those of
you who have not taken a United States history class, I recommend you at least
skim through each chapter. I will **NOT** quiz you on specifics, but I do
expect you to know the historical context of the work-related issues covered
in the course.

**Required Text**

> Boris  & Lichtenstein, _Major Problems in the History of American Workers_  
>  (copies at both the UTD bookstore and Off Campus Books on Campbell Road 2

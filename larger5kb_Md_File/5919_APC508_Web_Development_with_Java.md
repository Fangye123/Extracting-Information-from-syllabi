>  
>  **Course Overview**  
>  The class is a programming class - learning the basics of the Java language
through in-class quizzes, assignments and a final project.  The student is
expected to be knowledgeable in a high level programming language other than
Java(preferably C++ or C) and be able to apply that knowledge to learning a
new programming language.  The student will learn the basic syntax and
constructs of Java, Java class libraries, object orientation, Java Foundation
Classes, applications and applets for use with web browsers, multi-threading,
network programming using sockets, interfacing to C code using JNI(Java Native
Interface).  Time permitting, the class will try to focus on higher-level
concepts such as beans, JSP(JavaServer pages), JDBC(Java database
connectivity) and others.

>>  
>  
>  **Required Textbooks**  
>  None. Any book on Java 2 would be ok for this course.

>>

>> **Suggested Texts**  
>  Mastering Java 2 by John Zukowski by Sybex Press.

>>

>> **Reference material.**

>>

>> Java tutorial on <http://java.sun.com> is also a good starting point to
learn the various concepts in Java.

>>

>>  
>  **Notes and reading material**  
>  Class notes and general reading from your textbooks.

>>

>> **Software requirements for this course.**

>>

>> This class requires the Java 2 SDK. The class WILL be using Java 1.3 SDK.
Students can download the full SDK from [Sun's Java web
site](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/download.html). In order to complete the
assignments and projects, you will need the full SDK. The full SDK(1.3 or
later) has the following tools included. The above web site has the SDK for
both Windows and Linux platforms.

>>

>>   * The Java compiler ( javac.exe ).

>>   * Java VM (java.exe).

>>   * Java debugger(jdb.exe).

>>   * Other tools.

>>

>>

>> **Mailing List**  
>  A mailing list has not been set up yet. Once one has been set up, the
students WILL be notifed.  
>  
>  **Grading Policy**  
>  The grade for this class is broken up into 3 portions, quizzes/class
participation, 2 assignments and a project. The class DOES NOT have a midterm
and a final exam. Instead, students are required to turn in the assignments
and the project. The grades are broken up as follows.

>>

>>   * Quizzes / class participation (15%).

>>   * Assignment 1 (see details below) 10%

>>     * Assignment 1 is due on 07/17/2002.

>>   * Assignment 2 ( see details below) 10%

>>     * Assignment 2 is due on 08/07/2002.

>>   * Final project ( see details below ) 65%.

>>     * Project is due on 08/14/2002.

>>

>>

>> **Grading Programs (.java files)**  
>    | Style, Readability and Documentation | 10%  
>> ---|---  
>> Actual Java Code | 45%  
>> Correct Compilation and Execution | 45%  
>>  
>> **Assignments and Homework**  
>  All assignments MUST be submitted to the class e-mail address provided
above. Assignments MUST be turned in a .zip format using a zip program such as
Winzip for Windows(R).  Students NEED not turn in a hardcopy of the
assignments or the project. If any assignment has any readme( for special
directions), the file MUST be named README_ASSG#.txt where # must be replaced
by the # of the assignment. For the final project, it must be name
README_PROJECT.txt. **Late submissions will not be accepted under any
circumstances, unless you get special permission from the graduate school (
because of ill-health or otherwise ).** The following requirements apply as
well.

>>

>>   * All assignments and the project MUST be compilable without any errors.
If there are any compilation errors, the assignment / project WILL NOT get the
correct grade( See the above breakdown for grades ).

>>   * It is the responsibility of the students to ensure that the programs,
as submitted, compile.

>>   * Students are advised to compile their programs on JDK for Windows.

>>   * If students are using Linux for their development, students are
required to get the Linux machines for their development.

>>   * Instructor has access to JDK for Windows and JDK for Linux.

>>   * Instructor advises the students to use scripts for automating the
building of their projects. A makefile for Linux or a batch file(.bat) for
Windows would be useful for this purpose.

>>   * Including a readme for each submission would be very useful in ensuring
that the assignments and project are compiled by the instructor correctly.

>>   * All assignments and projects MUST be submitted in a .zip format. All
the files for the assignment and project MUST be within the single .zip file.

>>   * Students MUST submit all the source code for the assignments and
project.

>>   * Students MAY optionally turn in the files with the bytecode for the
assignments.

>>   * If students are using any additional Java packages, it is the
responsibility of each student to provide the package in the .zip file.

>>   * All assignments and projects are per-student. In short, each student
WILL work individually in order to complete the assignments and project. No
co-operation among the students WILL be permitted although the students MAY
discuss and bounce back ideas among themselves.

>>   * In general, copying source code from other similar projects that may be
published on the Internet is not acceptable. The exception to this rule is if
the student finds a package that is useful for a particular purpose. The hope
is that usage of such packages would be limited and altogether avoided.

>>

>>

>> **Coding guidelines.**

>>

>> Students are required to follow the following code guidelines in their
assignments and project.

>>

>>   * Use meaningful names for variables, classes, class variables.

>>   * Do not use cryptic names.

>>   * Each file will have a header at the beginning indicating the purpose of
the code in the file.

>>     * The header is commented and describes what the code in the file
accomplishes.

>>     * The header contains the name of the file, the student's name as well
as the assignment that it is part of.

>>   * Each class will have a header in comments before the class definition
starts explaining the purpose of the class.

>>     * The header describes the variables in the class, the constructors and
destructors for the class as well as the member functions.

>>

>>

>> **Computing Environment:**  
>  Workstations are available for use at the CSE computing facilities.  Hosts
'church' and 'state' have the java toolkit at /usr/java1.2/bin.  This path
should be added to your $path unix shell variable.

>>

>> You may also elect to install your own copy of the SDK(JDK) 1.2+ on your
systems at home.  It is available for download for many platforms at
http://java.sun.com/j2se    Some assignments will require use of the internet,
telnet and ftp for completion.  Use CSE facilities if you have any problems on
home or office machines.

change as necessary.

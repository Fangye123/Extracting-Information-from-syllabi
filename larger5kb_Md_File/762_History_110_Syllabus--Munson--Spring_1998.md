### Course Requirements:

Two mid-term exams, a final exam and a research paper are the written
requirements for this course. Failure to complete any of the requirements will
be regarded as a failure to complete the course, and will therefore result in
a failing grade. In addition, there are five short map and reading quizzes,
with one unannounced bonus quiz in the course of the semester. In preparation
for the paper, each student will prepare a statement of his or her paper
topic, with projected bibliography. This statement will not be graded, but
failure to hand it in will result in a loss of seven points on the final
grade. Papers received in the nine days after the due date, 5 p.m. on March
20, will be marked down up to one full grade. _Absolutely no papers will be
accepted after 5 p.m. on March 27._  
  
Exams and quizzes must be taken when scheduled. Make-ups will be scheduled
only by prior consent of the instructor, and only for compelling reasons (as
determined by the instructor). If a student, without gaining prior consent, is
unable to take an exam Because of sudden illness or some other extraordinary
event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I cannot be reached
directly or by phone, leave a message with the History Department. A student's
request for a make-up exam must be accompanied by a doctor's note or other
written documentation.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Exams:

The first mid-term exam will consist of short answer identifications. The
second mid-term will consist of essays only. The final exam will consist of
short answer identifications, and two essay questions, one of which will be
comprehensive (covering the entire course). As a study aid, class time will be
set aside for review sessions as indicated on your weekly schedule, but the
exams may contain material not covered in these sessions. The exams will be
designed to test acquaintance with the lectures and the assigned readings.
Taking careful notes in class and on the readings, therefore, is strongly
recommended. The instructor will be looking for evidence of general knowledge,
and an organized and analytical approach to that knowledge. In the essays, the
instructor will also be looking for an ability to combine the raw materials of
the course -- text, lectures, and documentary sources -- into pertinent and
meaningful insights. The instructor will also be evaluating your ability to
communicate those insights. Points will be taken off for run-on sentences,
grammatical errors, spelling errors, poor punctuation, illegible handwriting
or any other problems that, in the opinion of the instructor, affect
comprehension of the student's work. Strive above all for clarity. The two
mid-terms will be fifty minutes long, the final will be three hours.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Grading:

The mid-terms, the final, and the paper are worth 90 points each. The five
quizzes are worth eight points each, for a total of 40 points. Your final
grade will be determined by the total number of points you gain out of a
maximum of 400. I do not grade on a curve. Attendance, evidence of progress or
lack thereof in the course of the semester, and class participation, will be
used to decide half grades and borderline cases (which, experience shows,
means most students). Serious attendance problems or misconduct in class can
result in a lowering of grade. The grading scale is as follows:  
  
Score / Grade:  
388-400=A+  
372-387=A  
360-371=A-  
348-359=B+  
332-347=B  
320-331=B-  
308-319=C+  
292-307=C  
280-291=C-  
268-279=D+  
252-267=D  
240-251=D-  
Below 240=F

### Extra-Credit Assignments:

Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the instructor. These
assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor on or before
February 27, and will not be accepted unless so approved. They are worth a
maximum of 40 points. Under no circumstances will an extra-credit assignment
be accepted as substitute for any other written requirement in the course. An
extra-credit assignment can only elevate a student into a higher grade bracket
(for example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored the higher grade on
at least one of the three major exams or on the paper. The assignment must
take the form either of an analytical book review (not a book summary) 3-5
pages in length, or a second documented paper 5-7 pages in length, and must
utilize sources not assigned in this course. The topic and sources must be
substantially different from the required research paper. Style of text,
footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to the guidelines of the
departmental style sheet. If you decide to do an extra-credit assignment, it
must be turned in no later than March 27 for you to receive credit.

### Attendance Policy:

Class attendance is a requirement of this course. Repeated unexcused absences
will lead to a reduction of grade. Unexcused absences totaling 25% or more
will result in an automatic F for the course. The instructor will excuse a
student only under the most extraordinary circumstances. Chronic lateness will
also be penalized, since it presents a class disturbance. If a student arrives
after roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to place his or her
name on the class roll no later than the end of that class period. Failure to
do so will result in an unexcused absence.

### Honor Code and Plagiarism:

Students are expected to observe the honor code. All work for this course must
be pledged. Students found to have cheated on an exam or to have plagiarized
material in a paper will be subject to the maximum penalty under college
rules. For those in doubt about the definition of plagiarism, it consists of
copying passages from a source without both attribution **and** quotation. If
you have reproduced the language of your source, you have committed plagiarism
whether or not you have cited the source and the page number. This includes
passages that a student may have modified: for example, changed verb tenses,
omission or replacement of occasional words, reshuffling of phrases, sentences
or paragraphs, combining of different plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper
in your own words is far better than writing a good one using the words of
someone else. One suggestion for avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts
and sources: close all books when writing, and consult them only for specific
facts or direct quotes. Also, proofread your paper with plagiarism
specifically in mind. For more on plagiarism, see the departmental style
sheet.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Taperecording and Class Decorum:

Taperecording of lectures is not permitted. Students who are excused from
class by the instructor must make arrangements with the instructor or with
other students to cover the material missed. Students who skip class without
permission are responsible for making their own arrangements with other
students (not with the instructor) for the material covered in class.  
  
Students are expected to observe class decorum. Students engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent. By order of the department chair, food and drinks
are not permitted in the classroom.  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### Research Paper:

The research paper is designed specifically to show that the student can
research a topic and develop an analytical argument using source materials.
The emphasis should be as much as possible on _using primary source materials
from the period in question_. The use of documents from the assigned
sourcebook is a requirement. All students should meet with the instructor
about their paper topics, and do so as early as possible in the semester. Each
student will prepare a one-page written statement of his or her paper topic,
complete with bibliography, by the end of week three. These will then be
distributed to other students in the class, each of whom will prepare a
written critique due in the middle of week five.  
  
Neither of these assignments will be graded, but failure to complete either
assignment will result in a deduction of seven points from the final grade.
The final papers _must be printed on a word-processor_ , in a standard ten-
pitch font (courier 10 is preferred), with double-spaced text, a title page,
and one-inch (and no more than one-inch) margins. The text (not including
bibliography, title page and endnotes page) should be no less than 5 _**full
pages**_ and no more than 7 pages in length. This means that, if you use
footnotes (i.e., at the bottom of each page), the text must be _longer_ than
five full pages to compensate for the formatting of the notes. Your name, the
course name and number, section number and the date must be on the title page.  
  
It must include a bibliography of all sources cited. Bibliography and footnote
or endnote citations must conform to the proper style, as defined in the
"Department of History and Political Science Style Sheet" on sale in the
bookstore. More in-depth coverage of style questions can be found in the
latest edition of Kate Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses
and Dissertations_. **Do not use MLA, APA, parenthetical footnotes or any
alternative style current in other disciplines. Unless you wish to see the
instructor fly into a blind rage, make a particular point of not using
parenthetical notes**. All papers should be saved to disk in at least two
separate locations (hard disk and floppy, two floppies, etc.), so that a new
copy may be immediately printed in case the original hard copy is misplaced.  
  
The type of material that must be documented (i.e. footnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge, statistics, all quotes, and paraphrases or
summaries of an author's argument. All direct quotes over fifty words in
length must be indented and single-spaced as described in the departmental
style sheet. You should have at least one footnote per full page of text.  
  
It is imperative that you document source material, but the _argument or
thesis of your paper must be in your own words_ : excessive use of quotes or
lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads easily to the
grievous sin of plagiarism. On plagiarism, see above. The citation of at least
three different sources is a _minimal_ requirement for the paper. In addition
to the assigned texts, which you are required to use, you must utilize at
least one other source from the library. This source must be a scholarly study
of article or book length, or another set of primary documents beyond those
found in Tierney and Scott. You may use encyclopedias and other reference
works for background information only: these should not be cited as sources,
and will in no way be considered a replacement for a more substantial outside
source. Double-dipping (submitting a paper for this course that is
substantially the same as a paper submitted for any other course, past or
present) is not permitted  
  
Return to Table of Contents  
  
  

### CORRECT FORM FOR TERM PAPERS

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT use parenthetical notes!! Only footnotes and endnotes will be
acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.  
  
Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.  
  
The following are some useful examples from Turabian:  
  
Footnoting a book:  
  
    **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  
  
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,  
  
    **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)  
  
If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,  
  
    **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**  
  
Footnoting an article or selection in an edited anthology or book of readings:  
  
    **3 Klemens von Metternich, "Political Confession of Faith," in Brian Tierney and Joan Scott, eds., _Western Societies: A Documentary History_ , 2 vols. (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1984), 2: 239.**  
( _Note that in the above example, the number of volumes in the book appears
after the title and the specific volume from which the citation came appears
before the page number at the end._ )  
  
If a different article or selection is cited from the same anthology, students
should use the following form:  
  
    **9 Thomas Malthus, "First Essay on Population," in Tierney and Scott, eds., _Western Societies_ , 2: 144.**  
  
  
Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
  
    **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**  
  
Footnoting a Review:  
  
    **4 Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in _American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November l985): 726-29.**  
  
Footnoting a Journal:  
  
    **8 Don Swanson, "Dialogue with a Catalogue," _Library Quarterly_ 34 (December l963): ll3-25.**  
  
Electronic Documents (ONLY IF APPROVED BY INSTRUCTOR IN ADVANCE)

     **10 Michael Norman, "The Once-Simple Folk Tale Analyzed by Academe," _New York Times_ , 5 March l984, p. l5**  
  
Bibliography: Your bibliography should be entitled "Works Cited," and it
should only include works which you have cited in your footnotes/endnotes.

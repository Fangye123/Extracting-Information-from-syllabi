**Nationalism: East and West**

**(Russian and Eurasian Studies 330s)**

  
This course is designed to study the nature of nationalism, particularly in
Europe in the second half of the 20th century. We will explore the themes and
issues that comprise nationalism, such as language, history, religion and
territory, look at different types of national identity, how they drive people
to political violence, and what strategies states use to deal with ethnic
conflict. We will explore the thesis that Central and Eastern Europe peoples
approach questions of identity and citizenship differently from those in
Western Europe. At the end of the class we will discuss the future of
multinational and nation-states. What are their chances of survival?  
Early on in the course (second week), the class will divide into four groups.
Each group will begin work on a particular case-study. Two of those case
studies must deal with Central and Eastern Europe and two with Western Europe
and North America (in the past students have looked at the former Yugoslavia,
Ukraine, Canada, Spain, Ireland, Wales and the former Soviet Union). The group
will be responsible - after consultation with me - for bibliographies, the
division of labor between different members of the group, the themes to be
addressed and the overall cohesion of the group's presentation. I want to know
by our third class which case study has been chosen by each group. At the
sixth class each student will make a short presentation about the readings she
has done on her case study and will outline what in her view, the major issues
are. She will also show us a bibliography, including Web material. Weeks nine
to twelve will be reserved for each group of students to make a presentation
about their case study. Based on her contribution to the group case study, a
student will write a 15-20 page research paper. For example, a student working
on the former Yugoslavia may decide to write on the role of religion in the
dispute. By week eleven, l want to see a complete draft of the student's
paper.  
  
Evaluation will be on the basis of participation and presentations in class, a
book review and the final research paper of 15-20 pages. We will discuss how
you can get the best out of your group presentation and should students
require computer display facilities, they should let me know early on so a
classroom can be arranged.

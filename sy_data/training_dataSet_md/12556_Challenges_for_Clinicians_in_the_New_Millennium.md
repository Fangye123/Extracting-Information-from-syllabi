_**Challenges for Clinicians  
in the New Millennium**_ _ ****_

Rapid advances in pharmacology and medical devices have led to an explosion of
new techniques available to members of the anesthesia care team, while
economic pressures also threaten to reshape the clinical landscape.
Increasingly, we will need to know not only whether techniques are effective,
but also which techniques are most cost-effective.

The objectives of this conference are to help participants better understand:

  1. _The effect of revolutionary changes in health care on anesthesia practice_
  2. _How to use the new techniques, drugs and monitors_
  3. _How to incorporate these new tools into practice in the changing environment_ 

We will focus on the concerns of clinicians who work with a wide variety of
patients and practice settings. We predict that you will find our meeting to
be exciting, provocative, and educational.

_For those desiring additional CME hours,_ we have scheduled two optional
sessions on Friday and Saturday afternoons. On Friday, University of Chicago
faculty will lead an optional session with discussions of difficult problems
faced by practitioners. On Saturday, Dr. Andranik Ovassapian will lead his
always interesting, interactive Airway Management Workshop.

We will continue our popular format from previous years: intensive morning
sessions with afternoons and evenings free for enjoyment of all the shopping,
dining and cultural activities for which Chicago is famous. We will also
continue our popular feature for theater-lovers with a first come, first-
served option to purchase tickets for the Disney musical **_Beauty and the
Beast_** as well as the holiday favorite: ** _A Christmas Carol._** In
addition, we have secured a limited number of tickets for the blockbuster Art
Institute exhibition: **Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South**. The
Art Institute will host the only U.S. showing of this remarkable exhibition.

_**Location and Accommodations**_

Come and enjoy the Holiday season in Chicago! The conference sessions will be
held at **_The Drake_** , one of Chicago's finest hotels, located on Michigan
Avenue, the "Magnificent Mile." A block of rooms has been reserved at **The

_**Chicago is truly a city with something for everyone!**_

For the best in Holiday shopping there are the world famous stores and
boutiques of Chicago's Gold Coast. **_Marshall Field's, Lord & Taylor,
Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, FAO Schwarz,
Crate & Barrel, and Nike Town _**are all part of the excitement of Michigan
Avenue during the Holiday season. Water Tower Place with its many fine shops,
restaurants and movie theaters, is just a few steps away.

Chicago's museums are worthy of a day's visit in themselves, particularly **
_The Field Museum of Natural History,_** home of **_SUE,_** the largest, most
complete T-Rex ever discovered. No special tickets are necessary to view Sue,
just the price of admission ($8 adults, $4 children.) You can also choose to
visit the world-famous **_Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum of Contemporary
Art, the Shedd Aquarium, the Adler Planetarium,_** or the **_Museum of Science
and Industry._** __ Musical offerings vary from **_The Chicago Symphony
Orchestra_** and **_The Lyric Opera_** to the many blues and jazz nightspots
located throughout the city. You may enjoy sampling the variety of the
**_Steppenwolf, Goodman,_** and **_Victory Gardens_** theater companies.
_(Victory Gardens was the winner of the 2001 Tony for best regional theater
company.)_ You may want to experience the fun at Chicago's famous comedy club,
**_Second City._ ** You will certainly want to sample the fare at the wide
variety of restaurants featuring cuisine from all over the world. **See

**  
_Optional Tickets_**

In continuing a very popular tradition, we have secured a limited number of
seats to ** _Beauty and the Beast,_** Disney's smash hit musical, at the
beautiful Cadillac Palace Theater in Chicago's new theater district. Nominated
for nine 1994 Tony Awards including Best Musical, this eye-popping spectacle
has been wowing audiences worldwide, with record-breaking runs in New York,
London, Los Angeles, Toronto, Sydney, Tokyo, Stuttgart and Madrid. Based on
the Academy Award-winning animated feature film, Disney's musical extravaganza
is filled with technical wizardry, special effects and illusions, as well as
dazzling production numbers. These tickets for **Saturday evening, December
1** are $72 each, and are available on a first come, first served basis to
registrants and their families only.

We have also secured seats for the annual Chicago tradition: **_A Christmas
Carol_ ,** at the Goodman Theater. These tickets are for the **Saturday
evening performance, December 1** and are the perfect way to get into the
holiday spirit! Tickets for A Christmas Carol are $50 each and are available
on a first come, first served basis to registrants and their families only.

In addition to the theater options, we have secured tickets for the major Art
Institute Exhibition, **Van Gogh and Gauguin, The Studio of the South.** Co-
organized by The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum, this
exhibition examines the complex relationship between Vincent Van Gogh and Paul
Gauguin and the plan they developed together to create a "Studio of the
South." The Art Institute will host the only U.S. showing of this remarkable
exhibition, which features 125 paintings, works on paper, and sculptures.
Assembled from collections world-wide, the exhibition combines some of the
world's most famous images with rarely seen treasures. These tickets are $20
each and are for either Friday or Saturday afternoon to registrants and their
families only. **These tickets will go fast, so make sure you register
early!**

If you wish to purchase tickets for any of these events, please indicate on
your registration form and enclose your check by October 15. These tickets are
non-refundable.

### The Old Regime and the Revolution in France

**History 224  
John Cole**

    
    
    Objectives  
    
    Our principal objectives are to develop skills of critical reading and to
    prepare informed and balanced judgments on the Old Regime and the French
    Revolution.  Having said that, let me express summary judgments of my own
    that tend to 'condemn' the Old Regime without quite 'acquitting' the
    Revolution.  Go figure.
    
    The Old Regime seems truly archaic in its principles: first, political
    obedience to a hereditary monarch who reigned by divine right and ruled
    most of the Kingdom by royal decree, without representative law-making
    institutions; second, social subordination to a privileged nobility
    defined more by tax exemption than public service or personal merit;
    third, unquestioning allegiance to an established Church supported by
    ecclesiastical taxation, the suppression of other forms of worship, and
    the censorship of works deemed threatening to faith or morals.
    
    The contrary ideals of the Revolution, Liberty and Equality, still inspire
    Americans as well as the French, the lowly as well as elites, women as
    well as men, blacks as well as whites, gays as well as straights. 
    Although Revolutionaries hardly realized all such extensions in fact or
    even agreed on the meaning of their own ideals, at high cost the
    Revolution did occasion unprecedented arguments on behalf of Everyman and
    Everywoman and many real gains.  'Liberty' and 'Equality' sound pretty
    good--but state-sponsored Terror in the context of foreign and civil war
    is apt to look pretty bad.  Part of the fascination of the subject is to
    relate these ideals to this fact.

    Supplemental Reserve
    
    For preliminary instruction, a final review, or simple reassurance along
    the way, look here.  Palmer's textbook has been a standard introduction to
    modern European history since 1950.  This success in the market reflects
    the quality of the book.  The author's specialty was the French
    Revolution, so his Chapter IX (about 40 pp.) makes an authoritative as
    well as concise and accessible overview.  Cobban's History of Modern
    France has many of the same virtues; the author happens to have been right
    of center, more critical than not of the Revolution, as opposed to Palmer,
    who was much more sympathetic.
    
            Palmer, Robert. R.  A History of the Modern World.
            Cobban, Alfred.  A History of Modern France.

    Course Expectations, Requirements, and Grading
    
    You can expect me to come prepared; I expect the same of you.  If this
    were my course in an Old Regime of my 'good pleasure' rather than our
    course on the Old Regime and the Revolution, I would command attendance
    and penalize cuts.  Happily, it's a post-Revolutionary world of liberty
    and equality, and I won't do either.  You're free to come and to go in the
    new regime of your good pleasure.  But I can't guarantee that free-going
    will leave you fully equal, and, even in a liberal democracy, cuts by
    individuals wound the morale of the class.  Think fraternity.
    
    I expect you to come with assigned readings in hand and in mind, ready to
    initiate your own questions and to respond to mine.  Current pedagogical
    theory suggests that students learn better when they are actively involved
    throughout the semester.  Don't be afraid to show ignorance; deadlier
    enemies are diffidence and indifference.  After the most ominous threats
    from invading Prussians, the most heinous treason of aristocratic
    Frenchmen, and the quick capitulation of frontier fortresses blocking the
    route to Paris, Danton exhorted patriots: "Courage!  More courage!  Still
    more courage!"
    
            Thu.  01/30  2-4 pp. essay on Dickens and Doyle   20%
            Thu.  02/27  open book midsemester                20%
            Thu.  04/03  8-12 pp. term paper                  40%
            As scheduled by Registrar: open book final exam   20%
    
    Seniors writing theses this semester may request extended deadlines on the
    essay or the term paper.  No other professorial extensions for
    individuals; see the deans.  I customarily recognize a penalty-free grace
    period extending until I arrive at my office for the next working day;
    thereafter, I deduct one full grade per weekday of lateness, so that
    Thursday's A becomes Friday's B, Monday's C, Tuesday's D, etc.  Unexcused
    absence from the midsemester is a failure on the exam.  Unexcused absence
    from the final is a failure for the course.
    
    You may prefer to identify yourself on essays, papers, and exams only by a
    dated signature at the end.  This is a way of encouraging me to focus my
    attention on the work alone, not its author, while attesting your
    responsibility for it.  I can hope to evaluate a particular piece of
    written work, but not a mind, still less a person.

            2-4 PAGE ESSAY DUE AT CLASS ON THURSDAY ON THIS SPECIFIED TOPIC:
    Dickens claims historical truth for his Tale of Two Cities.  But modern
    scholarship has replaced the histories that informed and inspired him, and
    truths have changed.  Having read the relevant portions of Doyle's Oxford
    History, would you say that Dickens's representation of the causes of the
    Revolution 'fails' more by errors of commision (what he says that now
    seems wrong) or by errors of omission (what he doesn't say that now seems
    right)?

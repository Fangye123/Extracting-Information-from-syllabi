                                    **Guidelines for Seminar Presentations**

**   **

In these presentations, your task is to stimulate our engagement with the
readings and initiate discussion.  Therefore, do not merely summarize the
author(s)'s arguments, but instead critically reflect on the main arguments of
the text, using the following questions as guidelines:  



  1. Characterize the "project" of the book or essay.  What does it achieve or accomplish?  Characterize the discussions in which it makes an intervention.
  2. How is the argument made?  Which particular languages, rhetorics, or critical  approaches does it make use of?  What other know ledges do you need in order to engage the author's work or to understand her text?
  3. Why is this work significant?  What is at stake?  Does it transform accepted "knowledge"?  How?
  4. How does this work contribute to the production of new and/or alternative epistemologies?  To new understandings of gender and sexuality?  Of nation and/or race? 

Of power relations?

  THE COURSE.  During this semester, we will study the development of western
civilization from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern farming villages more
than 10,000 years ago to the opulent Hellenistic civilization fostered by the
conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when humankind emerged from
cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to build cities, and to
devise the complex system of social relationships we call civilization. We
will see how the invention of writing allows us to observe the systems of
government, society, and laws of the ancients. We will note the formation of
states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that recurs with infinite
variations over and over throughout the brief period of humankind's recorded
history. There will also be a strong emphasis on the art and archaeology of
the ancient world--the physical and visual evidence which each civilization
has left behind--and what they tell us about that society's tastes and
beliefs. This course will try to demonstrate how similar we are in many ways
to our ancient relatives, and how our basic characteristics as a species
remain unchanged. Due to the span of time we examine, we will be moving
quickly from one period to another, and the effect may at times be confusing.
Ask questions...let me know what is baffling or overwhelming.  The ancient
world is at once familiar and mysterious, and the gaps in our knowledge of it
allow for broad interpretation. I hope that this course will get you to think
and to analyze, to question "facts" and to develop your own opinions, for
these are the true benefits of studying history.

THE BOOKS.  Our basic modern texts for this course are:  
**     Knapp = **A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western Asia
& Egypt._ 4th ed.  
        Chicago, 1988.    
**     Martin = **[Thomas Martin. _Ancient Greece._   Yale Univ. Press.
1996.](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=trm+ov+toc)  
We will also examine original sources from:  
**     Bailkey = **N.M. Bailkey. _Readings in Ancient History._ Lexington,
Mass. 5th ed., 1996.

INTERNET RESOURCES: During this semester you should become familiar with the
course Web Page (http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_99f.htm).  The
syllabus, supplementary readings, study aids, and study guides for the exams
will be posted on the web page.  In general, I will also use the web page to
communicate with you between classes and to post changes in the course
schedule and assignments.  It would be a good idea to check the course web
page regularly for updates.  
---  
REQUIREMENTS.  There will be two map quizzes, and two in-class essay exams.
In order to "help" you keep up with your reading assignments, there will be
**_simple_** quizzes at the beginning of selected class periods.   The quizzes
are designed to see if you have read the assignments **_and will necessarily
be of a general nature_**.   They will occur roughly once a week.  The first
essay exam will constitute 30% of your grade, the second one 50% and the
quizzes and class participation/attendance the remaining 20%.  Some important
concepts and issues will be presented only in class, and for this reason,
class participation forms a significant portion of the final grade.  
---  
**Policy on Makeup Exams:** Students who miss the midterm and final exams will
be allowed to make up the exam only if they provide the instructor with
acceptable documentation explaining their absence. I expect students who will
miss an exam to inform me prior to the time of the exam, unless extreme
circumstances prevent this (you may do this by e-mail or by leaving a voice-
mail message at the above number, specifically directed to me).  The makeup
exam must be taken during the week following the missed exam, except under
extreme circumstances. Makeup exams are more demanding than regular exams.

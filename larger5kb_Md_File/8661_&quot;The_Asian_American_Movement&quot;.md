class ticket number: 121-866-200  
  
Tuesdays, 3 - 6 p.m.  
Room to be announced  
|  **Course Description**  
  

This class examines the Asian American Movement of the late 1960s and early
1970s and its legacy for today, especially for Asian American students. This
class has three goals: 1) to appreciate the Asian American Movement as a
grassroots mass movement involving thousands of people nationwide; 2) to study
the vision of justice, equality, and revolutionary change underlying the
Movement and its continuing relevance for today; and 3) to understand how
participants in the Asian American Movement linked the struggle for social
change to their own personal transformation (life values and goals). Reading
materials from this class are based on a collection of Movement documents
(newspapers, newsletters, student proposals for Asian American Studies, etc.)
compiled in the late 1960s and early 1970s by Steve Louie, which he is
donating to UCLA. Selections in the Reader represent only a small portion of
Steve Louie's collection, and the collection itself is only a small part of
the vast amount of materials produced by people in the Movement.

Attendance: this class meets only once a week, and attendance is very
important; missing more than one class session during the Quarter will result
in lowering a student's grade by one letter grade  
  
**Class Project**  
  

By tenth week, students will organize an educational program, preferably off-
campus, sharing what they have learned from this class and linking lessons
from the Asian American Movement to current community and student concerns.
The target audience for the event will be other students (UCLA and other
college campuses). Students from our class will be graded on all aspects of
preparation for this event, specifically: content of the program, quality of
the program, publicity, outreach and mobilization, securing funding and a site
for the event, and their ability to work collectively and cohesively to
organize this event.

  
**Groundrules for this Class**  
  

1) Make sure this is a class you really want to take (look over the syllabus
and assignments). This class takes students out of the "safe zone" of the
traditional classroom. Notice, for example, that there are no tests and the
assignments are not based on library research. This does not mean that this
class will be easy. On the contrary, students who are used to these
expectations will experience high levels of anxiety by 7th week. Please
carefully consider whether you want to take this class and accept the
responsibilities listed below.  
  
2) By enrolling in this class, each student is making a commitment to attend
all class sessions, to do the assigned work, and to take part in class
projects. Completing homework assignments on time is extremely important. The
homework is designed to help students with the class project.  
  
3) This class requires a considerable amount of work outside the classroom
(research, committee work, outreach assignments, community meetings, etc.).  
  
4) Grading for this class is based on each student's performance; we will not
grade on a curve. Some students come to this class with extensive experience
in campus activism and community work; we will expect more from these students
than those with less experience.  
  
5) This class focuses on student activism, but students do not have to be
activists in order to take this class or do well. On the contrary, some of the
students who will do the best work in this class will be those without
experience in campus or community struggles. Similarly, some of the students
who will have the most problems in this class will be those with activist
background because they will not take the readings and assignments as
seriously as others, feeling that they already know the subject matter. For
all students _ whether activists or non-activists _ we as instructors
emphasize the following: through this class, each student can learn many
important things, but it is up to each student to put aside preconceived
notions, to do all the assignments, and to take the initiative as part of
their learning experience.  
  
6) Finally, a key goal of this class is to encourage you to share what you are
learning with others, especially in the off-campus community and with students
at other campuses. In the late 1960s, the movements that created Ethnic
Studies began with a vision of education that linked classroom learning to
issues in the community. This vision continues today. Students have a special
responsibility to share their knowledge and resources with others in their
communities, including other campuses. Knowledge is too important to stay
within the classroom or the university. This is the spirit of the Asian
American Movement.

Reader titled "Power to the People! Empowerment and Democracy for Asian
Americans in the 1990s." During the Asian American Movement, student activists
learned that participation in struggles for social change also transformed
their own lives in terms of values and goals. Today, many Asian American
students talk about wanting to become "empowered." Write at least a two-page
essay answering the following questions: In this class, we have studied how
one generation of Asian Americans linked the struggle for social change to the
struggle for personal transformation. In class, we also stress the connection
between the "empowerment" of you as a UCLA student and the "empowerment" of
the Asian American community as a whole. Thus far, in your (young) life, do
you see a relationship between participation in movements for social change
and personal transformation? How specifically? Following this class, how can
you continue to "empower" the community through sharing of your knowledge and
talents? Five years from now? Ten years? Essays are due by **e-mail** to the
two instructors by Saturday, May 10.

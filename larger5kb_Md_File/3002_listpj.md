**Course Description:** This course invites students to examine what is known,
what is supposed, and what is imagined about arguably the most significant
human being who ever lived, Jesus of Nazareth.   Although precious little is
known about Jesus of Nazareth as an historical figure, testimonies about his
life and its meanings have appeared in every generation, beginning with the
early witnessing texts of the Christian Church (Gospels).  This course will
examine the Gospel narratives and consider how modern biblical scholars have
attempted to fashion an "historical Jesus."  But more than this is at stake.
The instructor holds that looking for or at Jesus is like looking down a well,
for what looks back can easily be one's own reflection--or projection.  To
make this point, the course will turn from quests for an historical Jesus to
consider how Jesus provides a continuing spur to the imagination, and that the
Jesus image has done so throughout the history of Western culture.   The
influence of the Jesus story on the modern imagination will be considered,
with particular attention being paid to literary and cinematic
interpretations. By the end of the course, students will be acquainted with
the Jesus portrayed as a sacred, even divine figure within Christian narrative
and theological interpretation, and also with the Jesus who lives on in other
contexts and interpretive frameworks:  the Marxist Jesus who is poor and a
liberator; the "illegitimate" Jesus claimed by a feminist interpretation; a
black Jesus; a sexually conscious Jesus; a hippie Jesus; Jesus as seen through
the cultural lens of Japan and Africa.  The question to be considered in this
examination of interpretations is this: do people see in Jesus only what they
want to see? Can we ever claim to see in Jesus--or anyone else--something
other than we want to see?

Course Description:  This course in social ethics course will examine the
roles of values in social systems through methods of inquiry used in the field
of Religion Studies.  The systems to be examined include education, the
economic system, criminal justice, and the issue to be explored will be how
these systems aim at justice--and how and why they often fail to deliver it.
Particular attention will be paid to the problems of poverty, race,
homelessness, domestic violence, societal values and value prioritizing.  The
goals of the course are:

 \--to provoke reflection on justice issues through critical literature,
including some classic  
   statements about justice as well as contemporary social commentary,
scholarly  
   resources,  practical "field" experiences, and encounter with
representatives who  
   work in the various fields we shall study;

\--to challenge assumptions and biases not only about how ideas are formed,
but how    knowledge and intellectual inquiry are themselves "constructed" in
social systems  
   and value communities;

\--to provide students with the resources of an action reflection model, with
modes for  
  evaluating experience, and with resources to help build informed personal  
   perspectives;

\--to build intellectual, social and moral community among students, faculty,
and    community persons;

\--to provoke critical understanding of moral meaning  in light of cultural
diversity,  
  otherness, and the challenge of ethical relativism.

The course employs multi-disciplinary perspectives currently at use in the
field of Religion Studies to approach the problem of practical justice, with
psychology, sociology, philosophy, literature, and religious and philosophical
ethics all contributing to the understanding of the role of justice in social
systems.  

* * *

  
**Service Learning Component:**   Students are required to engage in volunteer
efforts to gain practical experience regarding social systems.  The central
question of the course will be this:  How are social systems affected, and how
can they be transformed, by visions of justice and social responsibility?  
      Students will have been some guidelines concerning volunteer opportunities prior to the beginning of class, and the Chaplain's Home Page will continue to link to those opportunities.   
     Sites are not assigned but must have some connection with the work of the course, such as New Bethany Ministries, Center City Ministries, STAR program or other tutoring in local schools, South Bethlehem Neighborhood Center, Northampton County jail, Turning Point, work with local magistrate, volunteer work at St. Luke's or other area hospital, Boys and Girl clubs, and the like.  If you have a question about a site, make sure you ask the instructor.  Placement sites like the SMART Center will not satisfy this course requirement. 

     In addition, Lehigh University's Volunteer Coordinator in the Dean of Students Office, Ms. Julie DeMott, is available to help students secure placements.  Ms. DeMott's phone number is 85445, with the Community Service Desk number 4583;  her e-mail address is JUD2.  Consult as well the Community Service home page at Lehigh (check under "Find") or link through the Chaplain's Office. 

**Course Requirements:     Listed below are the requirements for the course:**  
 1.  Students will be required to set up a volunteer work opportunity with an agency or other service organization (3 hours a week is expectation of work assignment).  This must be accomplished by the third week of classes (by January 26).  Students who do not have a field assignment in place by that time should drop the course. 

 2.  Students must complete the attached information sheet and then keep track of hours worked.  A supervisor at the work sight must initial the hours worked as verification and do so each week.  A sheet is attached to this syllabus for that purpose.  It must be used, signed by site supervisors, and be submitted by the end of class.  Instructor reserves the right to contact supervisors to check on student participation in the service site. 

 3.  Students will be required to complete reading assignments, attend class and participate in discussions. 

 4.  Regular quizzes, exams on reading materials\class discussions will be given.  The quizzes will be objective in nature, but some short answer or short essay will be given. 

 5\. Journals will be kept to reflect on issues discussed in class and in the
community site workplace.  Journals should be kept on a computer file, so that
when requested by instructor, students can run off a readable copy of journal.
Entries are to be dated and journals will be collected at least twice during
semester, with May 1 being a date for final submission.  
When an in-class exercise is given, the work sheet should be included in the
journal.  
Specific assignments, like attending an AA meeting, will be directed toward
the journals and will be evaluated there.

In addition to placing all in-class worksheets in the journals, students are
to make weekly entries, with an expectation of a minimum of 10 entries
included.  Students are to report in journals on activities and offer
reflections that may be of use for directing class discussion or further
research.  A critical observation each week is to be entered concerning some
value-related issue in the work- site or in response to readings or class
discussion. Assignments will be given for particular topics presented  in the
"action-reflection" mode.

Evaluation/Grading:  Grade will be determined by how well the student has met
the requirements of the course.  In particular, the course grade will be based
on the following:  
 1.  Supervisor-initialed work sheets submitted by May 1.  This is a basic course   
  requirement that must be met if grade is to be submitted:  30 hours is
required.  
 Any variation from this expectation must be discussed and approved by
instructor.

 2.  Journals and assigned class discussion questions will count 25%.  Journals will be   
   evaluated for completeness as well as general quality.

 3.  Average of grades received on in-class quizzes/exams:  75%.  Quizzes will include   
  material discussed in class, so that attendance in class will be necessary
for good  
  performance on weekly exams.  Quizzes will be both announced and unannounced
and  
  may cover material for  the assigned reading of the class day.  Quizzes
cannot be made  
  up.  Instructor reserves the right to drop a lowest quiz in figuring grades.
Students may  
  only be excused from a quiz they miss by presenting a note from the Dean of
Students or  
  a physician excusing the  absence.

Service Site List: Below is a list of service sites in the Bethlehem
community, most within walking distance of the Lehigh University Campus, that
are recommended to you as you proceed to meet the "service" component of R. S.
68. This is not an comprehensive list of all opportunities available, but one
that is designed specifically for Lehigh students in this course. If you plan
an activity with an organization in the community not on this list, you should
discuss this with the instructor.

Agencies below were given preference because of their proximity to campus, or
because they have recently expressed interest in hosting Lehigh students.
**For most current volunteer opportunities check out the volunteer computer
bulletin board on the network server. To access this board type "volunteer" at
the main LUNA menu.** Brochures or additional information about all of the
organizations listed in this packet can be obtained from the Community Service
Center located in the Ulrich Center Student Activities room or by contacting
the staff at our e-mail address incsd@lehigh.edu or by phone at 758-4583. The
Center is open 12:00-5:00 pm weekdays.

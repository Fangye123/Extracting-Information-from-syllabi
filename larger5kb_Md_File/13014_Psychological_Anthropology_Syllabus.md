>  **Introduction:**  
>  
>  This course surveys some of the major developments in the field of
psychological anthropology since the middle of the century. The course has
four sections. The first is an introduction to psychoanalytic theory,
concentrating on those concepts that have become an integral part of
psychological anthropology as it has been practiced. The ethnography for this
section addresses the topic of "compenasatory masculinity " and gender
relations in an Amazonian society. The second section deals with two competing
approaches to psychological issues that arose as programs for studying
emotional issues cross-culturally. These are the culture and personality
approach and the study of ethnopsychology. The book for this section is on the
topic of women's being socialized into romance and marriage at a major
American university. The third section presents a variety of contemporary
efforts to augment these approaches through the study of personal narratives.
The ethnography we read is on the topic of life cycle narratives of men and
women in an Indonesian society. Finally, we will look at the current practice
of psychiatry in the US as a case study. Underlying contemporary psychiatry
are two competing models for understanding the human mind, one based on the
medical model and the other based on older more psychodynamic ideas. There are
very real political issues arising from that debate. The book is T. M.
Luhrmann's recent award-winning study of the practice of psychiatry in the
U.S.  
>  
>  The topics chosen for this course are driven by my own interests and
training. There are, therefore, important domains of psychological inquiry in
anthropology which will receive relatively little attention in this course--
cognitive development, language socialization, and altered states of
consciousness are but a few examples. I have tried instead to locate the
various topics we do discuss into a broad tradition of psychological inquiry
which focuses specifically on individual commitments to ideological systems.
As a result, the course carries a heavy emphasis on what compels people to
hold strongly to their beliefs. Belief systems discussed with include those
dealing with religion, self, gender, emotion, and sex.

>  **Course Requirements:**  
>

>

>   * **Prerequisites:** There are no prerequisites for this course, but
readings may be challenging.  
>  
>

>   * **Attendance:** Attendance is required. There will be some written
exercises and group work, and a 5% portion of the grade will be based on
attendance and material written during class periods.  
>  
>

>   * **Email Reaction Papers on the Reading** : Most weeks I will send, via
email, a question or suggested topic on the current reading. You will be asked
to address the question and react to the reading, turning in your responses
via email by 9:00 am Wednesdays. The responses should be 30-40 lines (or
300-400 words) long. You will be expected to complete six of these reaction
papers during the term. Four are direct responses to the reading, and two
should also include a response to other students' reactions posted online. You
may do more than six, and in that case the six with the best grades will
count. (these will total 20% of the course grade)  
>  
>

>   * **Exams:** There will be take-home midterm final exams, each worth 15%.  
>  
>

>   * **Papers:** You will be required to hand in THREE short papers (5-6
pages double spaced and worth 15% each), due at various times throughout the
term. Two papers will address issues raised in the reading and will not
require reference to any external sources. The other will involve your doing
some field work of your own. The aim of the papers is to help you assimilate
and integrate the readings by writing. Suggested paper topics will be handed
out in class separately.

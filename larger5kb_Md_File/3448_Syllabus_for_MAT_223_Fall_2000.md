**Catalog Description**

> An introduction to secondary mathematics teaching centered around classroom
observations, discussion of teaching and learning, and doing mathematics.

**Course Goals**

> The Mathematics Department has established five goals for this course:

  1. Experience the learning of mathematics in an environment envisioned by the [**Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org/previous/CurrEvStds/) and the [**Principles and Standards for School Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org), both developed by the [National Council of Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)](http://www.nctm.org).
  2. Develop a description of what a professional mathematics teacher's role is in selecting content for the classroom, planning activities for a lesson, structuring contexts for student learning, performing self-evaluation of personal growth and effectiveness, and remaining professionally alive.
  3. Develop criteria for analyzing mathematics lessons (experiences) in light of the NCTM's [**Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org/previous/CurrEvStds/), the [**Principles and Standards for School Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org), and the [**Professional Standards for Teaching Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org/previous/ProfStds/index.html).
  4. Compare and contrast the current vision of reform of mathematics education with your own experiences in mathematics education.
  5. Write a personal philosophy of mathematics education, describing mathematics, school mathematics, and mathematics teaching/learning.

**Textbook**

> [**Principles and Standards for School
Mathematics**](http://standards.nctm.org), published in 2000 by the [National
Council of Teachers of Mathematics](http://www.nctm.org).

**Course Activities**

> Course activities will include instructor and student presentations,
discussion of readings and assignments, observation of classroom teaching and
learning (live and video tape), attendance at the [Illinois Council of
Teachers of Mathematics](http://www.ictm.org) Annual Meeting in Springfield on
October 20-21, and group and individual work outside class.

**Course Grades**

> Your grade is based on my evaluation of your completed assignments and your
participation in the course. Here are the major required components of the
course that will be evaluated to determine your course grade. Details of the
requirements will be specified in class.

  * New Teacher Resources Reports (30%)
  * ICTM Conference Report (10%)
  * Various Weekly Assignments (30%)
  * School Classroom Observation Reports (10%)
  * Teaching Philosophy (10%)
  * Final Examination (10 am on Friday, 15 December 2000) (10%)

**Available Resources**

> STV 302 is open regularly for your use. There are multiple copies of many
books, booklets, pamphlets, and journals. You may use the materials there or
check them out on a limited basis.

>

> The [course web page](www.html) has links to materials related to the course
and to mathematics education.

**Attendance, Make-up Work, and Extra Credit**

> Your active involvement -- individually, in small groups, and with the
entire class -- is an important way for you to help meet the course
objectives. For you to be involved, you must be present. If you are now aware
of attendance conflicts or should you become aware of such conflicts, please
let me know of them as soon as possible.

>

> The deadlines, due dates, and test dates described in the written course
requirements and announced during class are just that. Plan ahead to complete
the required tasks on time; be prepared for quizzes, tests, and the course
exam. Make-up work is negotiated on an individual basis only under emergency
situations.

>

> The course requirements are designed to meet the objectives of the course.
Unless announced otherwise, there is no extra credit as a substitute for
successful completion of the required components of the course.

>

> I invite and appreciate your comments and suggestions for the course as it
unfolds. Please share with me in person or in writing your reactions and
perceptions. Your contributions will serve to enhance the course for you, your
classmates, and future students.

**Earth Science 202:**  
**Astronomy and Meteorology**  
**Spring 2001**  
**January 9 - May 3**

  
  
  
  
  

**COURSE DESCRIPTION: Earth Science 202 is a course based on various aspects
of astronomy and meteorology. The course will be divided into two main
sections. In the first portion of the course students will learn about the
formation of our solar system, the nature of gravity and light, the
composition of the other planets in our solar system, and the nature of stars,
galaxies, and the universe. The second portion of the course will be based on
meteorology which includes the study of atmospheric composition, cloud
formation, atmospheric circulation, and the formation of weather systems
(fronts). The course will consist of two lecture periods, Tuesday and Thursday
8:00-9:15 and one laboratory weekly. 4 Credit hours.**

**PREREQUISITES: An introductory laboratory science or equivalent.**

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Grading will be based on lecture and laboratory
performance, and an independent research project (paper and presentation).
Students will also be required to spend a few hours per week in addition to
time spent in the classroom and laboratory for laboratories that require
ongoing monitoring. The percentage that each of these requirements will
contribute to the final grade for the course is given below:**

**COURSE OBJECTIVES: This course is designed such that students should gain an
advanced knowledge of astronomy and meteorology. The students will also be
exposed to the interdependence of all the natural sciences and the importance
of each to the other. It is also a goal of this course to, whenever possible,
incorporate a discussion of the evolution of various sciences as perceived by
important figures in literature, philosophy, etc., in order to demonstrate the
interdisciplinary nature of the natural sciences, humanities, and social
sciences.**

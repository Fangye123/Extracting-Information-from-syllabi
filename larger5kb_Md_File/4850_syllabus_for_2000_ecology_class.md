research questions

**_OBJECTIVES_** 1) become familiar with major ecological concepts and
terminology; 2) understand links between ecology and other disciplines; and 3)
be better able to interpret scientific evidence derived from ecological
studies.

**_COURSE DETAILS_**

**Credit Hours** : 3        **Lec.Hrs/wk** : 3          **Lab. Hrs/wk** : 0

**Office Hours** : Official hours are Wednesday mornings, 8:00 - 12:00; feel
free to check my office at other times (if I'm in, I'll be glad to see you);

appointment

**Handouts** : Missed class? Come by my office (3024 Derring) during office
hours to pick them up.

**Field Trip** : There will be an extra credit, one day field trip to Mount
Rogers on Saturday, October 6 (rain date Sunday October 7).  


**_WORK REQUIREMENTS_**

**Lecture Exams** : Three one-hour lecture exams

**Final Exam** : Comprehensive, given on Tuesday, Dec. 20, 10:05-12:05 A.M.

**In-class Exercises** : **** Approximately ten (10) in-class exercises will
be handed out during various lecture hours (only one exercise in any one
lecture). You will complete the exercise and turn it in during class.
Provided you try to answer the question, you will get full credit regardless
of your answer.  I will drop one assignment and then calculate the percent of
the remaining exercises that you completed.

**Field Trip** : We will take an all day field trip to Mount Rogers on
Saturday October 6 (Sunday the 7th if Saturday has heavy rain).  This is
voluntary, but you can get extra credit for attending.

**Extra Credit** : Up to 5% extra credit for attending the field trip and
writing up small report.  For those who miss field trip, up to 5% additional
extra credit possible by writing a review paper.

**Policy on Tests and Absences** : I do not take attendance.  If you miss any
test for any reason, an all-essay make-up test can be taken.  If you miss an
in-class assignment, there is no way to make it up.  


**_GRADING_**

**Final Numeric Scores** :

Lecture exams (3 multiple choice/short answer tests) 65% of grade

Final exam (1 multiple choice test) 25% of grade

In-class assignments (approximatly 10) 10% of grade

Example:  * mean of 88% on lecture exams X 65 points = 57.2 points  
                * 85% on final X 25 points = 21.25 points   
                * turned in 8 out of 10 in-class assignments (8/(10-1) = 88.88%) X 10 points = 8.89   
                * went on field trip and turned in a short written report = 5 points   
                * TOTAL = 57.2 + 21.25 + 8.89 + 5 =  92.34%
**Grade Scale** : Letter grades will be assigned as follows:  
  90-100 = A | 70-77 = C  
---|---  
89 = A- | 69 = C-  
88 = B+ | 68 = D+  
80-87 = B | 60-67 = D  
79 = B- | 59 = D-  
78 = C+ | < 59 = F  
  
NOTE: I curve all test grades if the class mean is less than 75.  For a curve,
I add (75-class average) to each score.

Return to Table of Contents

###  Attendance Policy:

Attendance in the class is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Because much of the
information in this class comes from lectures, absences will place the student
significantly behind, therefore, attendance records will be kept. If a
student's absences, both excused and unexcused, equal 25% of the class days,
the student will automatically fail the course (no questions asked).

Make-up exams will be administered only when students can show a valid reason
for their absence (this means verification from either the health center or
from the dean). All students must make an appointment to take the make-up
within one week of the original exam. If such arrangements are not made, the
student automatically fails the course.

###  Class Discussions:

We will have five in-class discussions over the "Main Problems in American
History" paperbooks. All students are required to read both the essays and the
documents following the major essays in the books (note assignments in the
class schedule). The discussions, however, will be led by students. Every
student in the class will participate in leading one of the discussions. All
students are expected to participate in every discussion.

At the beginning of the semester, students will be allowed to sign up to lead
one of the discussion topics. The instructor, however, has final say in
dividing up the groups. Each group should meet outside of class and plan for
the discussion. The group's responsibility will be threefold: 1) all members
of the group will read the essay preceding the documents for their discussion
and will prepare a fifteen-minute presentation to the class about the essay's
contents; 2) the group will prepare at least two, open-ended questions over
each document for their topic, type up these questions, and distribute them to
every member of the class on the class day before the discussion; 3) the group
leaders will act as moderators and facilitators on the day of the discussion.
All members of the group will be given the same grade for the discussion
leadership, so it important to work together. More information on this
assignment will be given in class.

####  Note to Discussion Leaders

When formulating questions for the discussion, do not focus too specifically
on a single point made in the documents. Instead, ask questions that address
the underlying issues and events surrounding the time period covered by the
document. Ask questions that seek to discover the authors' motivations in
writing the things they did. Ask questions that seek to understand how points
made in the documents relate to other areas of American society of the time.
Try to relate the issues to the present and see how ideas, beliefs,
relationships, politics, social norms, etc. have changed since the period
covered by the documents. Basically, try to think of questions that will allow
several people to express their views and understandings, but **DO NOT STRAY
TOO FAR FROM THE DOCUMENTS** , as the primary purpose of the exercise is to
discover what these documents tell us about the society and time we are
studying. Remember, a big part of your discussion grade depends on how much
time and effort you put into formulating these questions. Good luck!

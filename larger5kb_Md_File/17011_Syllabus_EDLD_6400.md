DEPARTMENT MISSION

The mission of the Department of Educational Leadership is to prepare and
influence bold, socially responsible leaders who will change the world of
schooling. The values and beliefs of the department form the basis for
challenging assumptions about traditional forms of leadership in school
systems.

COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is designed to familiarize school leaders with essential features
of effective instruction which facilitate teacher autonomy. Students will
learn Instructional Supervision strategies to promote teacher leadership.
Specific course content includes teaching models, teaching/learning styles and
strategies, classroom management, student assessment, effective strategies for
special needs students, equity and access to quality education, basic
classroom observation techniques for improvement of instruction, and
technology.

This is the second of three courses of the Tier I Leadership Academy required
for the preliminary administrative services credential. Students will examine
current issues faced in the public schools as well as related "best practice"
and research findings. Students in this class are simultaneously enrolled in
EDLD 6802 Fieldwork II course. Experiences gained from the fieldwork form the
basis for application of concepts and skills learned in class. Class
interactions and sharing of fieldwork experiences contribute to learning and
are a valuable part of the introductory course and throughout the Tier I
program.

LEADERSHIP ACADEMY PROGRAM DESCRIPTION

The Leadership Academy provides opportunities for identified school leaders to
engage in learning within the context of diverse student populations found in
urban schools. Diversity and urban education are the strands that are woven
throughout the classes and activities in the LA within the framework of the
department's values and beliefs. The goal of the program is to prepare
educational leaders to successfully engage schools and their communities in
dialogue and action towards change that improves student growth and promotes
teacher leadership.

OBJECTIVES

Identify own beliefs and values regarding instruction and compare them with
current theory and knowledge about instruction of all students.  
Describe the major characteristics of four families of teaching strategies and
determine how they relate to types of student thinking.  
Identify a variety of strategies a teacher might use to promote equitable
access to quality instruction for all students in the class.  
Identify a variety of different strategies for assessing student progress and
achievement and relate how they are related to specified goals and objectives.  
Review educational literature and be cognizant of "best practice" in major
instructional areas, ie., special education, education of LEP students,
content area strategies, state's efforts towards more effective schools, and
successful school wide instructional restructuring movements.  
Identify basic elements of a classroom management system that promotes student
self-direction.  
Learn to use different types of classroom data collection approaches and
describe how each might be used to help a teacher analyze his/her teaching.  
Observe teaching episodes, analyze instruction and conduct conference with
teacher.

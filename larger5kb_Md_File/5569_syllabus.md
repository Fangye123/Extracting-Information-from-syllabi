* * *

**Objectives:**

The goals of this class are a comprehensive understanding of English literary
history from the medieval period to the close of the eighteenth century and a
development of critical reading and writing skills.

**Requirements:**

1\. Attendance: in-class work, both individual and cooperative, is a
substantial part of your term grade. In-class work cannot be made up;
therefore, more than two absences, of any nature, will affect your term grade.
Absences due to religious holidays are the only exception to this rule.

2\. Class preparation: students are expected to come to class having completed
and basically understood the reading assigned for that day.

3\. Electronic participation: students are expected to subscribe to the
englishlist-d-m listserv before 9/15/02and post at least two quality comments
before classes end.

4.Writing/Assessments: there are three short papers, one long paper, and a
final exam. All writing assignments must be turned in electronically.

**Communication:**

My office hours at 27 Mellen St. are MW 9:30-2:00, T 9:30-11:30,, and by
appointment. I encourage students to make appointments at other times if these
hours do not fit their class schedules.Feel free to contact me at any time
during the term; remember that if you are having a problem with an assignment,
I want to hear about that problem before the assignment is due.

**Learning Styles and Challenges:**

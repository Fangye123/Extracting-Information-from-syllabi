![](blueball.gif)_Expectations and Requirements_  

> **_READINGS:_** Required readings are listed with the schedule. The sections
should be read before the lecture for which they are listed.   I will be
placing other Mineralogy texts on reserve in Sprague Library if you find K&H
and Nesse too much.  I will keep you posted on this.

>

> **_IN CLASS:_** Your active participation (both as an individual and in
small groups) is essential to your success in the class, so ask lots of
questions and participate fully in group activities.  
>

> **_THE INTERNET:_**   Use of the internet will be required for some homework
assignments.  Please come see me early if you have a problem with access or
are unfamiliar with the internet. The internet is a vast resource at your
fingertips.  USE IT!

>

> **_CD-ROM:_**   Your textbook comes with a very nice, instructional CD.  You
should make a concerted attempt to use it because it will help to understand
concepts and study for exams.  The software has some hardware requirements
that need to met to use it (i.e. 16Mb RAM, etc).

>

> **_EXAMS:_**    Two one-hour exams and a two-hour final exam are scheduled.
Exam format will be short answer. Make-up exams will be given only in
exceptional circumstances.

>

> **_QUIZZES:_**   I will be giving you quizzes just about every week so that
you are prepared for the exams.  Some of them will be just short questions,
others will be lab-practical style (i.e. mineral ID).

>

> **_CLASS PROJECT:_**   I will work with you in small groups (max 3 persons)
or individually to develop a small-scale project.  What I have in mind is to
utilize the field trips as opportunities for you to collect samples from a
locality and work on them as a small "unknown" mineral collection.  I will
guide you along in terms of what data you might need to collect and
limitations.  I expect your to present you work either as a 12-minute,
"conference-style" talk or as a poster toward the end of the semester.

>

> **_CLASS PAPER:_**   Since we do not have time to do non-silicates you get
to pick a non-silicate mineral group (i.e. carbonates, oxides, etc.) or an
individual non-silicate mineral and give a short 2-3 page report.
Alternatively, you can write 2-3 page review of a mineralogy research paper.
I will give you some guidelines for writing this shortly.

>

> **_MYSTERY MINERAL ID:_**   Collect as much data on this specimen as you
can. The goal is for you to get familiar with as many ID techniques as
possible and to make a positive ID.  You will be using your sample throughout
the semester as we go through some of the techniques in class.  At the end of
the semester you will compile all your data to defend your ID.

>

> **_FIELD TRIP(s):_**   I will offer at least two one-day weekend trips to
local areas for purposes of mineral collecting for projects and to see some of
the classic mineral localities that we have in the area.  I will run one trip
over to the Franklin area.  We will rent vans to transport.  Also, the
Geological Association of New Jersey is offering a trip to look at some of the
mineral resources of central and southern NJ on Sat. Oct. 17.  This will offer
a great opportunity for you to collect samples for a class project.  If there
is interest I could offer a Fri-Sun trip to the Adirondacks, but we would have
to go within a month or so.

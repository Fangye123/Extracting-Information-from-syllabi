    |           **History 490. DISABILITY IN AMERICA  ** Professor Longmore  Phone: 338-6498  Office hours: Mondays, Wednesdays 2:10-3:30 PM or by appointment 

This course examines the historical experience of the disability minorities
during the modern era, focusing mainly on the American experience but
comparing that history to the premodern history of disability and to the
contemporaneous histories of disability groups in Western European societies.
The course uses the history of several of disability groups (deaf, blind,
developmentally disabled, and physically disabled people) as case studies to
analyze the ideological, socioeconomic, and political history of disability.
The course has three objectives: First, it seeks to reconstruct the historical
process by which disability became a major category of societal organization
in the modern era.  Second, it explores the interpenetration of modern
ideologies of disability as expressed in various institutions and spheres of
society, e,g, public policy, medicine, social welfare, education,
rehabilitation, and popular culture.  Third, it examines organized efforts
throughout the modern era on behalf of and by various disability groups to
address and ameliorate the socioeconomic disadvantages endured by those
groups.  Accomplishment of these three objectives will support achievement of
the central goal of the course: formulation of a comprehensive unified history
of disability in the  
modern era.  
    
**Course Requirements:** Students will write a take-home mid-term examination,
a take-home final examination, and a 20-25 page research paper.   The mid-term
and final will be based on the lectures and required readings.  Each will
count for 25% of the course grade.  The research paper will count for 50% of
the course grade.

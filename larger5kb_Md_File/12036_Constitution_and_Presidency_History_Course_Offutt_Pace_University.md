Information for this course, including a copy of this syllabus, the discussion
assignments, the take-home exams and the final (to be posted when due), and an
on-line discussion web-board can be obtained from the Internet at:

##  Course Goals and Objectives:

This course will examine American History from the 1780s to the present
through examining themes revolving around the Constitution and the Presidency.
My goal is to introduce students to historical analysis and argument, to take
whatever talent and knowledge you have and to improve both.  Students are
expected to learn not only the basic data of American history but also to
express that knowledge in oral and written argument that employs evidence to
prove historical theses.  Generally, lectures will be given twice a week, with
discussion of the week's reading on the third day.  Page assignments for
discussion are given at the end of this syllabus.  Students will also
participate in a small group discussion led by a student peer leader who has
taken this course already, and will participate by posting messages on the
class Web board (details below).

By the end of the course, you will be able to:  
1)  Identify the changing meaning and significance of individualism in United
States' society and politics.

2)  Discuss the major developments in Constitutional history on topics of
limitations on power and protections of minorities.

3)  Organize and consolidate material provided in lectures and readings in
order to answer essay questions which require comparative analyses, synthetic
thinking, and cause/effect linkages.  
    


##  **Reading Assignments:   Students will read from the following:**

  
Richard Ellis and Aaron Wildavsky, _Dilemmas of Presidential Leadership_  
Michael Riccards, _The Ferocious Engine of Democracy, vol. 2_  
Bernard Schwartz, _A History of the Supreme Court_

All of the above may be purchased at the Pace Bookstore.  Students are
encouraged to obtain copies of the books through older students who have taken
this course, through the student run Book Exchange (first weeks of semester,
in Art Gallery), and through on-line sources such as
[Amazon.com.](http://www.amazon.com)  


##  Course Structure:

###  LECTURES:

Each lecture is an essay in itself which answers a significant question from
the American past.  You must not only attend the lectures but you must also
take good notes on each, taking care to understand both the argument presented
and the evidence used to prove that argument.  For information on how to keep
up with the lecture pace (which I've been told is fast), see the note-taking
handout.  If, during a lecture, you feel you've missed a point, PLEASE jump in
and ask me to repeat the point or to slow down--I'll be glad to cover any
issue again or pause to allow you to catch up.  See [Notetaking
Tips.](http://webpage.pace.edu/boffutt/notetips.html)

###  ASSIGNMENTS:

All students must complete two take-home exams and one comprehensive final
examination, plus analyze the weekly readings.  Analysis of the readings
includes taking 4 quizzes (out of 8 reading assignments), participation in
weekly discussion, and leadership of one discussion panel.  Students must also
attend one of the weekly discussion sections, details of which are on a
separate handout..  Students, as part of their discussion participation, must
also use the Web Board assigned for this course (see below).

**2 Take-home Exams (Midterms):**   The exam will give you a choice of two
essay questions; you must answer one in no more than four typewritten, double-
spaced pages (I stop reading after four pages).  You will have one week to
complete the exam; the questions will be discussed on the class day that
follows their distribution.  The dates of distribution of the questions and
their due dates appear later in the syllabus.  You are encouraged to discuss
the question among yourselves, but all outlines and all writing must be done
individually.  I am happy to answer any and all questions on these essays
during office hours, by e-mail, on the web board, or at my home phone from 9
am until 10 pm.

**Final Examination:**   This comprehensive examination will consist of short
identifications and a choice of essay questions (from a list distributed)
which will cover the entire course.  You will be allowed to bring in one page
(front and back) of notes which must be entirely handwritten in your
handwriting; you will be required to turn in that page of notes with your exam
book.  The exam has been scheduled: for the 10:10 class on May 7, 10:55-12:35,
for the 11:15 class, on May 11, 10:55-12:35.

**Thoughts on Writing Essays:  ** Remember that there are no right or wrong
answers, only good and bad arguments.  Your answer should contain a clearly
stated position/thesis/overall generalization at the outset, supported by
subsequent paragraphs, each of which proves a logically needed element of that
thesis (a sub-generalization).  Within each paragraph, evidence must be
produced to convince me that the sub-generalization is true, and a good rule
of thumb demands THREE pieces of evidence to prove a sub-generalization.  A
good argument will then draw its various pieces, which together should
completely cover all aspects of the question, into a conclusion.  Obviously,
your essay should be planned and outlined before you write.

**NOTE** :  The best essays use material from BOTH readings and lectures.
Comments on your writing will be voluminous regardless of whether your essay
is an A or a D.  Don't be intimidated by the volume of comments; I enjoy
writing comments (semi-legibly) on your papers.

**Late Papers** _:_   The take-home exams are due in class on the date
assigned.  If you have a problem with completing an assignment, give me a call
before class.  PROBLEMS WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE PAPER IS DUE WILL BE
TREATED LENIENTLY AND WITHOUT PENALTY.  Otherwise, late papers lose 10% of
their numerical grade.

**Reading Quizzes:   **The books have been divided into daily assignments,
listed below.  To insure that the reading is completed for discussion, at the
beginning of 4 discussions there will be a short-multiple choice quiz of 6
questions on that week's readings.  I will drop your worst quiz result and add
up the remaining 3 quizzes to give you a number out of a maximum of 25.

**Discussion:  **  In-class discussion is designed to make sure every student
has understood the assigned reading as well as explore deeper historical
issues and controversies.  Each week, a page of discussion questions will be
distributed which will form the core of the next discussion.  Each student
MUST lead the class for one week's assignment; she and/or he will be
responsible for answering both factual and interpretative questions posed in
the handout as well as any other questions in his/her section of reading.
"Audience" members earn points toward their discussion grade by quizzing the
panel about the facts, commenting about the issues, or asking questions about
interpretation.   Therefore, discussions can be compared to a talk show, with
my job being to stir up controversy and to keep your thoughts and the
conversation moving.

This semester, students will earn discussion points on line, both before and
after the assigned date for a reading.  A Web Board, designed for on-line
discussion, has been established for this class.  Students **MUST** post to
the Board at least **3 (three) times** during the semester; the discussion
grade will be reduced for failure to post.   Over 3 postings, students earn
the equivalent to the points they would have earned if they had spoken such a
comment in class.  Specific topics, both before and after the due date, will
be posted, and students may comment on them or create topics of their own
relevant to that reading.  Full description of how to use the Web Board will
be distributed separately; those who are technologically ambitious or who are
familiar with this format can reach the Web board through the web page set up
for this course (address is on the first page).  A training session in a
computer classroom will be given during class time.  Students are expected to
have either a computer account with Pace or access to the Internet through a
home computer prior to the second week of class.

###  GRADES:

Grades will be apportioned on the following point basis:

Quizzes         25             Take home exam #1   50             Final exam
100  
Discussion     25             Take home exam #2   50

Maximum point total is 250; 150 points is the lowest pass.  Other grade cut-
off points will be determined during the course, on a curve based obtaining a
B.

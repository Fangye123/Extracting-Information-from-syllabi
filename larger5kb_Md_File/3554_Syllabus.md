If I am not in my office, let the phone ring a few times and you can leave a
message on voice mail.  When sending in assignments by fax, include your name
_and_ my name on the cover sheet, since many instructors share the same fax
machine.   It would also be a good idea to put your name on the top of every
sheet, and to indicate on the cover sheet how many pages you sent.

PREREQUISITES: A grade of "C" or better in DVST 0920 within the past year, an
ACT score of 21 or better within the past year, or the appropriate placement
by the COMPASS exam.

COURSE DESCRIPTION **:** Focuses on the strategies of problem solving. Topics
in the course are taken from financial mathematics, logic, probability,
statistics, and discrete mathematics.

GENERAL OBJECTIVES:  This course is designed to give you a solid preparation
for further math courses.  We will investigate various topics in math -
Problem Solving Techniques, Logic, Statistics, Probability, Finances,
Geometry, and Discreet Math.  Students who successfully pass this class with a
grade of "C" or better will be prepared to enter MATH 1100, Theory of
Arithmetic for Elementary Teachers, or STAT 2005, Elementary Statistics, or
STAT 2070, Social Science Statistics.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES: Students will learn about problem solving techniques and
strategies, and then use them to solve problems involving finance,
probability, statistics, voting theory, and logic. If time permits, students
will learn the terms used in geometry and how to find areas, perimeters, and
volumes of shapes.

METHODOLOGY:  It will be assumed that any student in this class has access to
the internet.  Having internet access at home is convenient, but not necessary
as long as you have access somewhere, such as one of the computer labs at
Casper College. We will be using WebCT, which has its own internal e-mail and
a board for news and discussions. You should check both frequently.  It will
also be assumed that students in this class are familiar with the internet and
their internet browser.  You may be asked to do research on-line, so be able
to conduct on-line searches.  Let me know if you need any help.  
     Students will be assessed on a regular basis by projects, quizzes, and exams.  Some of the quizzes and exams will be administered on WebCT, where you will take the quiz or exam on-line.  Some of the exams may be "pencil and paper" proctored exams. Projects and some quizzes will be submitted either by e-mail (or word processor documents sent as an e-mail attachment), fax, regular mail, or in person.  These will have a due date.  Any work submitted after the due date (or post-marked after the due date if mailed) will be subject to a deduction of points, and the point deduction will increase with the number of days it is late.  I will remind you of impending due dates in the WebCT calendar and news sections of WebCT.     
     Any work submitted must consist of more than just answers (except any multiple-choice quizzes or exams taken on WebCT).  Points may be deducted for not showing work even if the answer is correct.  
     For work that is not submitted on WebCT, I _strongly_ recommend that you keep a copy of anything you turn in.   The easiest way to do this is to do your work in a word-processing program, save it on a disk, and submit it by an e-mail attachment.  An alternate way, if you prefer to do your work with paper and pencil,  is to photocopy any work you submit.  The reason I recommend this is because things get lost in the mail (even e-mail), and yes, even your instructor has occasionally lost things.  So please, for your own sake, keep a copy of everything.   
     While I recognize that working together is beneficial and should be encouraged, I do want to stress that anything you turn in, especially exams and projects, should be a product of your own effort and should be in your own words.  Duplicate submissions (for example, two students submit an exam or a project that are identical or nearly identical) are both subject to a deduction of points.  When a project is assigned, you will be told whether you must select your own topic or if you can work together.

Places to go for additional help or information:  
1)  My office - either in person, by phone, e-mail, WebCT e-mail, WebCT
discussion board, etc.  See the top of the syllabus for contact information
and office hours.  
2)  The Math Learning Center (Math Lab) located in PS 104\. Hours will be
announced.  
3)  The Casper College [Distance Education
Homepage](http://www.cc.whecn.edu/distance_ed/) for general information about
distance education.  From there, follow the link labeled [How to Get
Started](http://www.cc.whecn.edu/distance_ed/starting.asp) for more
information about registration, orientation, and the equipment requirements to
take an internet course. Take the [Creating Your Student Account on
WebCT](http://www.cc.whecn.edu/distance_ed/webcttutorial.htm) link for a WebCT
tutorial.  
4)  The [web site for our textbook](http://www.awlonline.com/bennett-briggs/).

ASSESSMENT:

1)  QUIZZES:  Problems from the text book will be assigned for practice.  Some
quizzes may be on-line (through WebCT).  Other quizzes that consist of
problems from the textbook or problems that require more work shown may be
submitted in other ways (e-mail, e-mail attachment, fax, regular mail, drop-
off, etc.)  There will usually be one quiz per week. It will be announced
ahead of time whether a quiz will be on-line or not.  
2)  PROJECTS:  The projects are a little more involved than homework
assignments.  Projects will require you to work with your text book, your
instructor, the internet, and other outside sources.  There may be some
research involved, and there will be a writing component with each project.  
3)  EXAMS:  Some exams may be on-line (through WebCT) and some exams may be
"pencil and paper" proctored exams.  The date and type of exams will always be
announced ahead of time.  Exams taken on-line must be taken during a pre-set
time period, and will be timed.  For example, if a test is given through
WebCT, you may take the test anytime during a three day period, but once you
start you must finish within one hour.

EVALUATION CRITERIA: An approximate breakdown of your grade in this course is
as follows (subject to change):  
        Quizzes:  about one per week, usually worth 20 points each  
        Projects:  probably two of them, worth 50 points each  
        Exams:  three of them, worth 100 points each  
        Final exam:  worth 100 points

Your total points earned will be divided by the total possible points to
arrive at your percentage.  I use the usual 90-100%=A, 80-89%=B, 70-79%=C,
60-69%=D, 0-59%=F.

REQUIRED TEXT, READINGS, MATERIALS:  
1)  "Using and Understanding Mathematics - A Quantitative Approach", by
Bennett and Briggs, 2nd edition, published by Addison Wesley is the required
textbook. This is a new edition and is _not_ the same edition that was used
last semester. There is also an optional student guide available for purchase.
You can purchase the textbook by going to the Casper College bookstore in
person or by visiting their web site at:  
<http://shop.efollett.com/htmlroot/storehome/caspercollege184.html>[  
](http://shop.efollett.com/htmlroot/storehome/caspercollege184.html)2)  A
scientific calculator. You will not need a graphing calculator, but if you
already have one that would be fine.  If your calculator only does addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division, you will need to buy or borrow a
scientific calculator.  A good scientific calculator will probably cost less
than $20 at most stores.  
3)  Access to the internet.

LAST DATE TO CHANGE TO AUDIT STATUS OR TO WITHDRAW WITH A "W" GRADE:  Friday,
March 22, 2001 will be the last day to drop this class.  No change to an audit
will be given.

STUDENT RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES:  
     Please refer to the Casper College Student Conduct and Judicial Code for information concerning your rights and responsibilities as a Casper College student.  
     If you have a complaint, problem, suggestion, etc. concerning this course, please consult with me, the instructor, first.  If we can't resolve the issue, we will then consult with the chair of the Physical Sciences division.    
     It is the policy of Casper College to provide appropriate accommodations to any student with a documented disability.  If you have a need for accommodation in this course, please make an appointment to see me or a Casper College counselor at your earliest convenience.

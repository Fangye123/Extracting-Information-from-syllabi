**HISTORY OF SCIENCE:   ORIGINS TO NEWTON**

* * *

**I** n this course we survey changes and developments in Western science
(natural philosophy) from earliest times through the Scientific Revolution of
the Seventeenth century. Lectures, discussions, and readings are concerned
with the origin(s), transmission, and development of scientific ideas, and the
emergence of new intellectual and language communities; particular emphasis is
given to changing views and conceptions of 'science, nature, and man.' There
will be a **One Hour Exam** in addition to a last **Take-Home Essay** ; class
attendance and participation in discussion is mandatory. Students may write an
optional extra-credit **Term Paper**. Office hours for Dr Hatch are Wednesday
3.00-6.00pm, and by appointment, 4123 Turlington Hall; Telephone: 392-0271.

(50%). Written take-home essay. This Essay exam is limited to 1000 words, the

add as much as one letter grade to final course grade. The paper is non
compulsory; no one is penalized for not choosing this option. The term paper
allows interested students to pursue a course topic in greater detail or to
identify an area not treated in this general survey. But it is important to
consider whether you have sufficient time to make a solid and rewarding
effort, given that required readings in this course increase in quantity and
subtlety for the Last Take-Home Essay. Kindly consult the _Study Guide_ for
details regarding topic selection, approval, submission timetables,
bibliography, and suggestions about research and writing. As always, students
should take full advantage of Office Hours for discussion and consultation.

regardless of their writing skills, are strongly encouraged to visit the

additional assistance.

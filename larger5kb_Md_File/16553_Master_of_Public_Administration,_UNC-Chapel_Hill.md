**Course Introduction**

This course will look at the role of technology in government and nonprofit
organizations, including implementation, cost analysis, data management, and
impact on citizens and clients. Specifically the course will touch on
Geographic Information Systems (GIS), networking (hardware, connectivity, and
software), software packages, training, Web Site design, security, and
management. Best of all, the course will draw on experts from around the state
and in the private sector who will visit the course as guest speakers,
including vendor demonstrations.

**Texts**

  * [Digital Convergence: How the Merging of Computers, Communications and Multimedia is Transforming Our Lives](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1890154164/qid=997969330/sr=1-2/ref=sc_b_2/107-6316930-3113308) by Andy Covell, Fredrick Whyte (Illustrator) (Paperback - December 1999) 

**Online Resources**

  * [Center for Technology in Government](http://www.ctg.albany.edu/)

  * [NC Center for Nonprofits](http://www.ncnonprofits.org/)

  * [Center for Public Technology](http://www.cpt.unc.edu)

  * [Fundsnet Services Online](http://fundsnetservices.com/) (Grants and Fundraising Portal)

**Assignments**

Most of the assignments will be reading for class discussion. Short written
assignments (usually 1 to 3 pages) will develop out of class discussion and be
assigned at the end of the class session, to be posted to the listserv. By
February 6 partners, teams, or groups will begin a IT management project with
a local government or nonprofit to be completed by March 13. The product
turned in for the project will be determined by the nature of the work. The
final project for the course will be the development of a course text and
online Web page for the work of all the projects. Level of pass (high, medium,
or low) will be determined by indivdiual assignments, class participation
(including listserv, e-mail, and discussion forum), and evaluation from local
government and nonprofit organization.

**Bulletin Description:  
** Procedural and data abstraction. Elementary abstract data types, including
stacks, queues, and their applications. Intermediate abstract data types,
including trees, heaps, hash tables, and their applications. External methods.

**Prerequisites:  
** Quarter prerequisite: CS-1622, Semester prerequisite: CS-1511. This course
also assumes a working knowledge of C.

**Course Objectives:  
** The course begins with a brief introduction to the C++ language and the
concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. The
basic design principles of object oriented programs are discussed and the
concept of abstract data types (ADTs) is introduced. The ADT concept is then
elaborated on in a series of assignments and lectures covering the basic ADTs:
lists, stacks, queues, tables, trees and graphs. By the end of the course, the
student should have mastered the main concepts of Object Oriented Programming
and have successfully completed programming assignments in C++ on each of the
basic ADTs.

**Texts:

  1. Robert Lafore, [ _Object-Oriented Programming in C++, 3rd Edition,_ ](http://www.mcp.com/sams/detail_sams.cfm?item=157169160X) Sams Publishing, Indianapolis, 1999, ISBN 0-57169-160-X. **Note:** There are a number of typographical errors in this book, mostly non-critical. I may try to compile a list of them with your help (let me know if you find one); unfortunately there is no list that is maintained by the publisher, as there is for the following text. 
  2. Berman, A.M., [ _Data Structures via C++: Objects by Evolution,_ ](http://www.rowan.edu/evolve) Oxford University Press, New York, 1997, ISBN 0-19-510843-4. **Note:** There are typographical errors in this text that you should be aware of. A list of them can be found at [ elvis.rowan.edu/evolve/errata.htm ](http://elvis.rowan.edu/evolve/errata.htm) 

**Course Requirements:  
** You are responsible for reading the assigned textbook material and for the
material covered in class, including:

  1. Lecture notes 
  2. Assignments and handouts 
  3. Programming assignments and homework 
  4. Films 

If you are unable to attend a class meeting, it is your responsibility to
obtain class notes, assignments, and extra copies of handouts. ALL ASSIGNMENTS
ARE DUE AT THE START OF CLASS ON THE DUE DATE.  Programming assignments will
be docked 25% per day if turned in late. All assignments must have a typed
cover sheet with your name, course and assignment title on it. All assignments
must be stapled.

**Equal Opportunity:  
** As instructor, I shall make every attempt to treat all students equally,
without regard to race, religion, color, sex, handicap, age, veteran status,
or sexual orientation. I encourage you to talk to me about your concerns of
equal opportunity in the classroom. To inquire further about the University's
policy on equal opportunity, contact the Office of Equal Opportunity, 255

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have any disability (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect your ability to perform in this class, please inform me at the start of
the quarter. I may adapt methods, materials, or testing so that you can
participate equitably. To learn about the services that UMD provides to
students with disabilities, contact the Access Center/Disability Services, 138

**Examinations and Grading:  
**

There will be two midterm exams, worth 100 points each. These are problem-
based exams in which you should expect to write C++ programs from start to
finish without the aid of any course materials or the text. Exams will be
handed back, reviewed and then re-collected in recitation. If you are unable
to attend recitation of the day exams are handed back and discussed you are
encouraged to come review your exams during office hours with the instructor.
Scores and total points are posted to the course web page. The two-hour final
examination is cumulative. There will be no make-up exams or course
"incompletes" without PRIOR consent of the instructor, and even then only in
VERY unusual circumstances.

Grades will be posted periodically on the class web page [
(http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs1521)](http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs1521)
using the last four digits of your student id number. If you wish to have your
scores posted using a number other than your student id you may email your
request to the instructor.

**Grading Procedures** Final grades are based on total points distributed
approximately as follows:

  * Labs and other assignments (approx. 400 points) 
  * Midterm Exam I (100 points) 
  * Midterm Exam II (100 points) 
  * Final Examination (200 points) 
Grades are assigned based on a percentage of the total points.

  * A- cutoff is 90% 
  * B- cutoff is 80% 
  * C- cutoff is 70% 
  * D cutoff is 60% 
  * F is below 60% 
These percentages may be lowered slightly but they will not be raised.

**Exam Schedule:** **Exam**|  **Points**|  **Date and Time  
---|---|---  
Midterm Exam I |  100 points  |  Wednesday, October 4, 11-11:50 in MWAH 195  
Midterm Exam II |  100 points  |  Wednesday, November 15, 11-11:50 in MWAH 195

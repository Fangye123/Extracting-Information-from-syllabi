**Welcome to History 3322, the history of the Vietnamese War.   This course is
designed to be a lecture course focusing on the prominent developments in
twentieth-century Vietnam and the United States intervention there.  We will
also use readings, discussions, and video presentations to supplement the
class lectures.  During the course of the semester we will examine the
fundamental issues in history of Vietnam and the American involvement in its
civil war-cum-revolution, including, but not limited to: the emergence of
Vietnamese nationalism and Communism and the rise of Ho Chi Minh; the battles
against French colonialism and Japanese occupation; putative independence and
the 1st Indochina War; the initial American commitment to French-occupied
Vietnam; the Diem regime in the late 1950s; the Kennedy and Johnson
escalations; the debate over U.S. intervention; the American air war; division
within the military over strategy; the Nixon approach; widening the war into
Cambodia; the "search" for peace; the final offensives; the antiwar movement
and the media; the POW and MIA issues; and Vietnam since 1975.  By the end of
the semester, each student should have a basic and working knowledge of the
Vietnamese war.**

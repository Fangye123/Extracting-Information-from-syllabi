Project ideas for Ornithology

Below are a number of ideas for your research projects, including some
relevant references for each. These by no means are all that can be done, just
some ideas to get you started thinking about different possibilities for
projects.

Another approach to designing a project is to do so by observing
concentrations of birds for a period of time, and generating testable
hypotheses about their behavior, feeding, spacing, or other things.
Suggestions for where to find good concentrations of birds would be any of the
parks in town that have both water and picnic areas (for example Reid Park,
Columbus Park, Ft. Lowell Park; plenty of grackle groups!), at other nearby
locations or parks (Sweetwater wetlands, Madera Canyon, Saguaro Nat. Park), or
at feeding stations (either already established, or one that you establish
yourself).

You will need to decide on a reasonable, workable idea for a project by Tue,
Jan 29th. At this time, you will hand in a brief proposal outlining the
research question, and a brief methods (One page roughly).

If you have ideas you wish to discuss, please come and talk to one of us.

    
    
     
    
    
    1.  Contextual Variation in song delivery.
    
    	Many birds exhibit temporal and contextual variation in their delivery of songs, 
    and in their responsiveness to the songs of members of their species. These variations 
    include short-term changes, such as locations in their territory, proximity to conspecifics,
    and longer-term variations, such as with phase of the nesting cycle, time of day or season, 
    and even in relation to weather conditions such as temperature. They also show variation in 
    their responses to playback of songs, both in the long- and short-term, mimicking their more 
    natural responsivity to the presence or absence of singing by other birds.
    	Many potential projects can make use of this variation, either studies designed to 
    quantify changes in song behavior at different nesting stages, different photoperiods 
    (dates), or in response to mates. We can also construct various types of tapes to broadcast 
    songs to individuals, and their responses to these tapes can be measured.

    2.  Relationships between habitat variables and nest density
    
    	The density or abundance of both number of birds of a particular species as well 
    as the number of nests of that species is often directly related to characteristics of the 
    habitat. At a broad level, most species show specific preferences for habitat types, 
    which upon inspection can be found to be determined by some aspect of the habitat, including 
    food resources that relate to foraging style, or availability of potential nest sites. Many 
    studies can be designed to examine the relation between a species' abundance or nest abundance 
    and some aspects of habitat. Species for which nests might be easy to find and identify 
    include verdins, phainopeplas, cactus wrens, nest cavities in saguaros (of gila or other woodpeckers, 
    or elf owls), or curve-billed thrashers. Habitat variables might include density of particular 
    plant species (e.g. cholla or saguaro cactus) or some estimate of average plant height. The 
    number of individuals of a particular bird species can also be related to plant species 
    density.

    3.  Behavioral responses to the presence of predators
    
    	As a way to avoid predators, birds learn to recognize their appearance and the 
    sounds they produced.  Being able to recognize predators is the first step to escape from 
    them. Once birds discover the presence of a predator they could respond by hiding, 
    reducing vocal communication, escaping from the area, or even attacking the predator.  
    Their responses will depend on the species of bird, the type of predator, they are facing, 
    their age and experience facing predators, or the stage of their annual cycle they are in 
    (breeding, molting).
    	The use of visual decoys and playbacks of predator sounds allow us to measure 
    behavioral responses to predators in an experimental way.  Comparisons between species, 
    habitats, and nesting vs. non nesting individuals are just some examples of different 
    projects that can be done in relation to this topic.

    4.  Plasticity in the use of nest building materials.
    
    	Birds tend to show preferences for material when building their nests.  In some 
    species individual birds tend to use the same materials to build their nests even if their 
    nesting sites show differences in the availability of these materials. Other species show 
    considerable plasticity in the use of building materials, resulting in a noticeable 
    variation in the structure of their nests. Changes in the use of different nest building 
    materials is usually related with the availability of material in the nesting sites. 
    	Different research question can be asked in relation to the differences in nest 
    building materials used by birds. Do desert birds living in urban areas use the same 
    materials to build their nests?  Are nest materials present in nests correlated with the 
    abundance of materials in the nesting territory?

    5.  Nest predation experiments using artificial nests and eggs
    
    	Nest predation is common and drastically reduces breeding success in birds.  
    It accounts for up to 88 percent of nest loses in some temperate and tropical habitats.  
    Because nest predation is a powerful force that can control population size, birds 
    tent to camouflage both their nests and eggs to protect them. To understand the pressures 
    imposed by predation on nesting birds several experiments have been conducted using 
    artificial nests and eggs.  
    	The use of artificial eggs allows use to answer different type of question. 
    They allow to have big sample sizes to compare nest predation rates among habitats, 
    compare day vs. night predation rates, or the role of microhabitats in nest predation.  
    The use of eggs made of modeling mass help to identify predators by looking at the marks 
    they left on the surface of the artificial eggs.  By painting eggs with different colors 
    and patterns, it is possible to evaluate the importance of egg marks as camouflage.

    6.  The Effect of Sugar Concentration on Hummingbird Feeding
    
    Hummingbirds are small nectarivorous birds with high mass-specific metabolic rates. In 
    order to meet their metabolic demands, hummingbirds rely on frequent meals of 
    sugar-containing floral nectars. Choosing optimal sugar concentrations to balance 
    energetic and osmoregulatory demands is essential for survival and successful migration 
    and reproduction. Therefore, it is important that these birds show a rapid behavioral 
    and physiological response to fluctuations in food availability and environmental 
    perturbations. It has been shown that when sugar concentration (i.e. energy density) in 
    artificial nectars is experimentally increased, nectar-feeding birds decrease their 
    volumetric food intake. Researchers have suggested that this is a compensatory response 
    to maintain a constant level of energy intake, possibly subject to limitations on sugar 
    hydrolysis and absorption (at high concentrations) or water processing (at low 
    concentrations).
    	Many potential projects can make use of this behavioral response to food energy 
    density. For example: Given a choice, will hummingbirds always choose the most concentrated 
    nectar, or will they choose a concentration close to that produced by most ornithophilous 
    plants (approximately 23% wt/vol sucrose)? Is there a nectar concentration above or below 
    which hummingbirds will not feed?

    7.  Are plumage characteristics an indicator of dominance in male birds?
    
    Plumage characteristics are regarded as outward displays of male dominance or body 
    condition, and therefore possibly reproductive success, in many avian species. For 
    example, dominance rank and aggressiveness of male house sparrows are positively related 
    to the circulating level of plasma testosterone at the establishment of dominance 
    relationships within flocks. It is though that the best morphological predictor of 
    dominance rank of male house sparrow is the size of their black throat patch (i.e. badge), 
    and males appear to use their badge for signaling their status in aggressive encounters 
    with other males. Rufous bush chats (found in the Old World) show a conspicuous tail color 
    pattern during nest defense, aggression, and courtship. Certain characteristics of these 
    color patterns appear to be associated with dominance, mate choice, and likelihood of nest 
    predation. Another example is provided by the mascot out our local NFL franchise: dominance 
    appears to be associated with the redness of a male cardinal's plumage, both during the 
    breeding and non-breeding seasons.
    	Many potential projects can make use of observations of plumage characteristics. 
    These projects, potentially examining the relationship of plumage and male dominance, 
    interactions with females, or possibly even observations of pairing would be based on 
    qualitative plumage and behavior scoring because you will not be able to capture birds. 
    House sparrows are abundant on campus, and northern cardinals (and congeneric pyrrhuloxias) 
    are easily found in Catalina State Park just north of Tucson. In addition, house sparrows, 
    cowbirds, starlings and house finches are abundant at the UA Dairy Barn facility.

In HE306 we will examine the definition and conventions of the novel.  First,
we will review the critical debate over the origins of this genre in the
eighteenth century.  Next, we will discuss the elements of novel and will
explore how these have changed over the last three hundred years.

**Course Policies**

**Format of Papers** :  I expect you to type on the computer all paper
proposals and final drafts.  Other assignments (including quizzes, tests, and
rough drafts) may be handwritten.  Please double space your papers, number the
pages, and put approximately one-inch margins on all sides. I will not accept
handwritten final drafts, nor will I make allowances for papers handed in late
because of computer, printer, or typewriter problems.

**Writing Assignments** :  You will write two four- or five-page papers.
After you have decided on a topic, you will write a short proposal (not more
than a page) in which you will briefly discuss your audience, your thesis, and
your plan of organization. You will also write one response paper and one
summary of a piece of criticism; a list of requirements for these assignments
will appear shortly.  Finally, you will have frequent reading quizzes and a
final examination.  
You must hand all papers in on time.  I will deduct a grade for each class a
paper is late.  Remember that the minimum requirement for passing this course
is to hand in all required essays.

**Final Grade:**

Essay One (final draft)        25%  
Essay Two                         25%  
Response Paper                   5%  
Critical Summary                10%  
Final Examination                10%  
Participation                        10%  
Quizzes                               15%

You will be allowed to revise the first major paper for a better grade if you
so desire.  I will average the original grade and the new grade together to
decide what goes in my records.  I will also drop the lowest quiz grade.

**Extra Instruction:** I encourage you to seek extra instruction during office
hours if you need help.  Students receiving a grade of C- or lower on any
essay must make an appointment for extra instruction as soon as possible after
getting the essay back.

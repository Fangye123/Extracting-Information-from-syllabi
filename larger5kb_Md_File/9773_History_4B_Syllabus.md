Remember that a book review and a book report are not the same thing. A book
report is a mere description or summary of the contents of the book. A book
review may contain some summarizing, but it must incorporate both analysis and
criticism as well. The criticism may be negative or positive (or a mixture of
both), but it is vital that you cite evidence to support the points you make.
A book review will usually answer some or all of the following questions. What
was the author's purpose in writing the book? What were the failings,
according to the author, of previous books on this subject? To what extent
does the author succeed in proving his/her case? What kinds of primary sources
did the author use (and how effectively)? What (if any) aspects of the book's
argument did you find surprising or enlightening? Were you convinced by the
author's arguments (why or why not?). For additional guidance, see the
suggestions produced by the History Department at the University of Calgary in
Canada: <http://www.uclagary.ca/review/review.html>.

Your book review must be accompanied by a copy of a substantial (over 500
words) review of the book from a scholarly journal, and **a copy of the review
must accompany your paper.** At the Reference Desk in the Davidson Library,
you can consult a useful guide, _How to Find Book Reviews._ Journals that
contain such reviews include the following: _American Historical Review,_
_English Historical Review,_ _Historical Journal,_ _Signs_ (for women's
history and culture), _Journal of Medieval History,_ _Speculum_ (for medieval
history), _Renaissance Quarterly,_ _Sixteenth-Century Journal,_ _Church
History,_ _London Review of Books,_ _New York Review of Books,_ _Journal of
Medieval and Renaissance Studies,_ _Journal of Family History,_ _Journal of
Social History,_ _Journal of Modern History,_ _Albion,_ _French Historical
Studies,_ _Economic History Review,_ _Journal of Ecclesiastical History,_
_Journal of the History of Ideas,_ and others. Your review must contain
discussion of the scholarly reviewer's points and your own response to them.
You may make use of more than one such review (and if you do be sure to append
a copy of each review you used)), but at least one is required. **_Papers that
are not accompanied by such a review and that do not incorporate its contents
in some way will receive a failing grade. Reviews from the Internet (including
comments by readers of books on the Amazon site) are not acceptable for this
assignment. *_**

* There are two exceptions to this rule. Book reviews published by the scholarly chat rooms under the umbrella of H-Net (<http://www.h-net.msu.edu/reviews>) will be allowed if you print out a copy of the review and attach it to your paper. On-line reviewing of this kind is, however, a fairly recent phenomenon. Therefore only books published in the last three or four years are likely to have been reviewed on the various H-Net lists. You might also find reviews in scholarly journals from another website ([www.jstor.org/cgi-bin/jstor/gensearch](http://www.jstor.org/cgi-bin/jstor/gensearch)).

_Grades:_ Grades will be calculated as follows: mid-term exam (20%); final
(40%); book review (20%); source essay (10%); section performance (10%). The
final exam will include essay questions posed by the Teaching Assistants, so
be sure to get the exam from _your TA_ because the exams will differ. The
final will also include IDs drawn from _WT_ that may not have been mentioned
or received much attention in the lectures. Please note that all elements must
be completed and that the two writing assignments must receive passing grades
if you are to pass the course.

_Cheating and Plagiarism:_ If you are caught **cheating** on an exam or
**plagiarizing** a writing assignment, the consequences will be serious and
can include **expulsion from the university.** If you are unsure what
constitutes plagiarism, err on the conservative side. Remember that when you
are using information from a published source of any kind or from a
professor's lectures, you must enclose any words that are not your own in
quotation marks and cite their sources in a footnote or endnote. In the case
of quotes from _Kings, Saints and Parliaments,_ _The West Transformed,_ or
from the book you are reviewing, a page reference in parentheses is
sufficient. Even when you are not quoting, if you are paraphrasing information
from such a source, a reference is necessary. You are entirely responsible for
knowing and following the principles of paraphrasing. You should never retain
a sentence pattern and merely substitute synonyms for the original words nor
retain the original words and alter the sentence pattern. For a fuller
statement about plagiarism, see the website for this course and the brochure
on academic honesty available at the Office of the Dean of Students. Note also
that it is a violation of academic integrity to submit the same work for
credit in more than one course.

We take no pleasure in having to state that offences against academic honesty
will be taken very seriously, but previous experience makes this statement
necessary. Be aware also that we are acquainted with the various web sites
where papers are available, so do not use such sources and attempt to pass
them off as your own.

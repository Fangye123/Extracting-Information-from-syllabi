Karen White, Assistant Professor  
Office: 207A | Hours: Tues/Thurs 10:00-12:00 or by appointment  
Phone: 621-5958 Email: [kmwhite@u.arizona.edu](mailto:kmwhite@u.arizona.edu)  
Class: Tues/Thurs 2-3:50, B12 Art

**Course Description**  
An advanced course in electronic imaging that utilizes the computer to create
both still and moving images and explore interactivity in visual communication
and personal expression. Studio projects will explore electronic imaging,
refine skills, and exploring the possibilities of digital video, animation,
interactivity, and time-based presentations. You will be responsible for
learning software, producing projects that explore these issues and developing
content, as well as researching contemporary artists, film makers, and
designers using digital media and presenting this information for analysis and
class discussions. During the semester, you will be producing a range of
projects. You are responsible for developing content and in-depth research and
process. A minimum of 3 academic references will be cited for all projects. In
addition, a detailed process book / journal will be required for this class
showing each project showing your notes, research, process sketches, mind
maps, word lists and verbal and visual ideas.The objectives of the class are:
To investigate the various approaches to typography and design in a time-based
medium; To investigate the various approaches to typography and design in an
interactive medium; To broaden the scope of traditional applications of the
medium, encourage experimentation in concept, style and format: To introduce
the history of digital media in the context of art and design. Throughout the
semester we will be working on projects and address some of these questions
directly within the framework your projects. During the course we will be
covering and you will be required to use the following and demonstrate your
knowledge in your projects of the following:

**Software:**  
Macromedia Director, miscellaneous Digital Video, Audio and other Web Design
software

**Formal Concerns:**  
Sequential Structures and Interactivity

**Historical/Conceptual Concerns:**  
Narrative Structures, History of Digital Media, Time-Based Work, Animation

Course content will be covered through projects requiring: research,
notations, roughs, comprehensives, and finished art, supported by handouts:
course lectures, critiques, one-on-one consultations, demonstrations, slide
presentations as well as writing assignments, readings, and discussions.

Graduate students will be responsible for completing all assignments with
rigorous investigation and exploration as well as develop one self-defined
project for the semester that references their personal interest and possible
thesis application. (This may or may not be one of the directed projects) A
formal review of this project will take place at the end of the semester
outside of class time. The Graduate student will write a one-page paper
describing the effects of the project towards further work and cite importance
of historical figures or theories influencing work.

**Evaluation**  
To be successful in this class, it is expected that you will work hard, bring
curiosity and enthusiasm to the class, and share your thoughts with the class
and instructor. Accolades will be given to those who reach beyond route,
predictable, traditional formats and materials for solutions while maintaining
a cohesive visual and conceptual idea. When you have investigated a problem
and still find that you need extra help, or if you have any questions about
the problem, I am available during office hours or by appointment or by email.
All projects are evaluated based on process, concept, and realization criteria
as demonstrated through sketches, thumbnails, storyboards, implementation of
process, analysis and revisions. Projects may be turned in after critique for
a revised grade as long as project is available for discussion during
critiques and feedback was taken into consideration of project.

Project 1: 10% Project 2: 10% Project 3: 10%, Project 4: 10% and Project 5:
30% 10% professionalism and class participation, 20% Research Oral
Presentation (A-E standard grading criteria)

**Attendance:**  
You are allowed 3 absences after which your final grade will be lowered by one
full letter grade for each subsequent absence. If you miss a class, it is your
responsibility to obtain any notes, instructions, or materials prior to the
next class. Three late arrivals or early departures constitute an absence. A
missed critique will result in one letter grade lower for project (ie. an A
project will be noted as a B).

**Supplies:**  
Journal/Sketchbook, | Digital Storage Devices (Zips or Jaz) at least 2 of each
(you must back up all work 2x!)

**Required Text**  
1) Director Demystified 7  
2) Six(+2) Essays on Design and New Media

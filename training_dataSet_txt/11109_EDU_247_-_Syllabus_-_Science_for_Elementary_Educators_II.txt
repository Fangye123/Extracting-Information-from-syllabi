Standards


 

The content development of this course fulfills 
              the requirements set forth by the:


National Science Education Standards
Minnesota Graduation Standards.

The standards that will be addressed in the course 
              are:




 
National 
            Science Standards




 

Standards for Professional Development for Teachers 
              of Science
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARD A:

              Professional development for teachers of science requires learning 
              essential science content through the perspectives and methods of 
              inquiry. Science learning experiences for teachers must involve 
              teachers in actively investigating phenomena that can be studied 
              scientifically, interpreting results, and making sense of findings 
              consistent with currently accepted scientific understanding. 

Address issues, events, problems, or topics 
                significant in science and of interest to participants. 
Introduce teachers to scientific literature, 
                media, and technological resources that expand their science knowledge 
                and their ability to access further knowledge.
Build on the teacher's current science understanding, 
                ability, and attitudes.
Incorporate ongoing reflection on the process 
                and outcomes of understanding science through inquiry.
Encourage and support teachers in efforts to 
                collaborate.

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARD B:
Professional development for teachers of science 
              requires integrating knowledge of science, learning, pedagogy, and 
              students; it also requires applying that knowledge to science teaching. 
              Learning experiences for teachers of science must 

 Connect and integrate all pertinent aspects 
                of science and science education.
Occur in a variety of places where effective 
                science teaching can be illustrated and modeled, permitting teachers 
                to struggle with real situations and expand their knowledge and 
                skills in appropriate contexts.
Address teachers' needs as learners and build 
                on their current knowledge of science content, teaching, and learning.
Use inquiry, reflection, interpretation of research, 
                modeling, and guided practice to build understanding and skill 
                in science teaching.




 
 SCIENCE CONTENT STANDARDS




 

Science as Inquiry Standard
In the vision presented by the Standards, inquiry 
              is a step beyond "science as a process," in which students 
              learn skills, such as observation, inference, and experimentation. 
              The new vision includes the "processes of science" and 
              requires that students combine processes and scientific knowledge 
              as they use scientific reasoning and critical thinking to develop 
              their understanding of science. Engaging students in inquiry helps 
              students develop

Understanding of scientific concepts.
An appreciation of "how we know" what 
                we know in science.
Understanding of the nature of science.
Skills necessary to become independent inquirers 
                about the natural world.
The dispositions to use the skills, abilities, 
                and attitudes associated with science.




 
PHYSICAL SCIENCE, LIFE SCIENCE, AND EARTH AND SPACE 
            SCIENCE STANDARDS




 

The standards for physical science, life science, 
              and earth and space science describe the subject matter of science 
              using three widely accepted divisions of the domain of science. 
              Science subject matter focuses on the science facts, concepts, principle 
              theories, and models that are important for all students to know, 
              understand, and use. Tables 
              6.2, 6.3, and 6.4 are the standards for physical science, life 
              science, and earth and space science, respectively.

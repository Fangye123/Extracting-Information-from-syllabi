**Course Description:**

> The first course in the physics of saturated flow in porous media. Topics
include ground-water occurrence, Darcian flow, well hydraulics, flow nets, and
layered systems flow. The basic concepts of pollutant movement and unsaturated
flow are introduced and case studies are analyzed. Prerec: ME 330 or CE 341 or
consent of instructor.

**Text:** Applied Hydrogeology by C.W. Fetter

**Basic knowledge required:**

> Water runs downhill  
>  Unit conversions  
>  Mathematical manipulation of an equation  
>  How to read and plot a graph (xy, semilog, log)  
>  Basic integration and differentiation



**Learning Outcomes:** At the completion of the course, the student will be
able to:

> Access information and equations from texts on groundwater  
>  Estimate groundwater recharge from stream elevation data  
>  Describe the differences between confined and unconfined aquifer systems  
>  Draw a flownet  
>  Predict steady-state groundwater flow between a source and sink  
>  Predict the transient drawdown of a water table subject to groundwater
withdrawal  
>  Determine aquifer properties from pumping test data  
>  Describe anomolies in pumping test data  
>  Understand basic water chemistry  
>  Predict the steady-state movement of a contaminant plume  
>  Determine and describe the zone of influence of a pumping well  
>  Understand basic carbonate equilibrium  
>  Describe major aquifer systems in Kentucky and the US

The university guidelines state that the minimum punishment for
cheating/plagiarism is an "E".

The class relies heavily on your ability to utilize the text by Fetter to
solve problems. You will be graded on your ability to identify the problem,
describe a solution procedure, locate the appropriate equations in Fetter, and
calculate the answer. All exams are comprehensive and open book ( **not open
notes** ).

Make-up exams will be prepared for students missing an exam because of a
University excused absence. There will be no other make-up exams.  
  

**Project:**

> Throughout the semester we are going to develop our skills to analyze
ground-water problems. Since communication will be an essential part of any
job you may accept after graduation, I think it is appropriate to have a
writing exercise. I would like you to write a **creative** , short story
describing a ground-water problem. The story may include people, aliens,
monsters, cartoon characters, courtroom scenes, villains, etc. **The project
must include the description of a groundwater problem and the equations to
support any conclusions that you derive from your story.** The entire scenario
should be fabricated, but should include correct fundamentals of groundwater
hydrology. I don't think a story can be developed and resolved in less than
four pages. I do not want to read more than 20 pages. You will be graded on
writing ability, story content, creativity, and accuracy of your ground-water
analysis. **The project is due on December 13.**

**General Comments:**

> Homework problems will be distributed. It is your responsibility to complete
the work. In addition, there are answered problems in the text to work and
many of the examples in the text are excellent. I expect you to work in groups
to complete and discuss homework. I do not recommend that you do this in other
courses as it can be considered cheating if you are receiving a grade. You
don't have to do the homework, but students that do the homework tend to do
better on the exams.

>

> Quizzes will be given at the end of every class period that does not contain
a pre-test or test. The quiz will generally cover material discussed during
that particular class. The quizzes will be graded on a 0-2 scale. A score of 2
will be given to students that understand the material, a score of 1 will be
given to students that have some idea of the material, and score of 0 will be
given to students that missed the quiz. Try to bring books and calculators to
each lecture.

>

> I have a policy of giving a pre-test during the lecture period prior to the
test date. I highly recommend that you not miss any of the pre-tests since
they give you an indication of the types of problems that may be on the actual
test. These are worked in class with immediate feedback from me concerning any
questions.

> I believe that the Fetter text is the best groundwater text available. You
should be able to get an A in the course without listening to me. If you read
the text, attend class regularly, work through the example problems, work the
homework problems, and understand the pre-tests, you should have little
trouble with the course.

**Course Description**  
This course introduces students to three major topics in political analysis:
the scientific method, research design, and statistics. The first component of
the course is devoted to the evolution of the scientific method, the basis for
scientific claims, and the application of empirical research. Students will
learn a brief history of science, and consider the challenges confronting
modern research. The second  component of the course introduces students to
mechanisms that can be used to "tell the story" of political causation.
Students will learn how to construct a good hypotheses, make valid causal
inferences, operationalize concepts, and use the comparative method.  The
third component of the course covers quantitative topics such as central
tendency and variation, measures of association, and regression analysis.  In
order to show the relevance and applicability of the different techniques,
real examples will be used whenever possible.  By the end of the course
students will have been exposed to the basic tools necessary to begin
conducting, understanding, and critiquing social scientific research.

**Reading Assignments:**

**Required Readings:**  
**[How We Know What Isn't so: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday
Life](http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2O0HU4I46A&mscssid=6GA7229GDXS12LS100CGND08M7HQ0FE6&pcount=0&srefer=&isbn=0029117062)**
(Thomas Gilovich)  
Gilovich reviews a number of fallibilties to which casual observations are
subject. The author's seeks to illustrate the importance of systematic
(scientific) methods to draw conclusions about the outside world. Gilovich
illustrates his points with vivid examples and supports them with the latest
research findings in a wise and readable guide to the fallacy of the obvious
in everyday life.

[**Social Statistics: A User-Friendly
Approach**](http://vig.abacon.com/catalog/abbooks/0,2371,0205140041,00.html)(Schacht
& Stewart)  
This text is written specifically for introductory social science students,
many of whom experience anxiety about statistics. Each statistical
concept/technique is illustrated by a recognized cartoon such as "The Far
Side," by Gary Larson, "Calvin and Hobbes," by Bill Waterson, and "Bloom
County," by Berke Breathed. Humor aside, this textbook contains in-depth
coverage of all the requisite statistical concepts. It simply transforms a
topic students frequently find boring, paralyzing or stressful into an
enjoyable learning experience; a technique that Schacht has successfully used
for nearly ten years.  

**Suggested Readings:**  
**[Designing Social Inquiry: Scientific Inference in Qualitative
Research](http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=2O0HU4I46A&mscssid=6GA7229GDXS12LS100CGND08M7HQ0FE6&pcount=0&srefer=&isbn=0691034710)**
(King et. al.)  
This book introduces students to conducting non-experimental, non-quantitative
research in a scientific manner.  Most of the information we receive about
politics and the world in general is qualitative, so it is important that we
understand how to make valid inferences based on qualitative data.

**[The Simpsons: A Complete Guide to Our Favorite
Family](http://shop.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=3M9MOGI42N&mscssid=6GA7229GDXS12LS100CGND08M7HQ0FE6&pcount=0&srefer=&salesurl=Rbn.com/&isbn=0060952520)**
(Groening  & Richmond)  
For longtime Simpsons fans and newcomers to the series alike, there's plenty
of great laugh-inducing information here. This glorious reference manual
dedicates one or two full-color pages to each and every episode in the first
eight seasons of The Simpsons, splitting the pages up to include a plethora of
Simpsons trivia. _While this book has nothing to do with any required topic
that will be covered in my class, I encourage students to read it nonetheless.
My leactures are based largely on a working knowledge of the Simpsons, largely
as a tool to keep students interested in the topic. If you've never watched
the Simpsons, and have no idea what I'm talking about, don't worry. You will
be fine. Being a Simpsons' fan like myself is by no means required. It merely
helps you enjoy the class all the more._

We will be using [SPSS](http://www.spss.com/) and Microsoft Excel, both of
which are available in the classroom and at computing sites around campus.  


**Course Requirements/Grading:**

  * Class Participation 10%
  * Homework 20%
  * Midterm 30%
  * Final Exam 40%

  
**How to Make the Best Grade Possible ***

  * Become familiar with the readings _before_ coming to class  
    *           Read the material as many times as it takes to understand it 
    *           Take notes as you read (either in the book or separately) 
    *           Present any questions you have (during class or office hours, or by [e-mail](mailto:woessner.2@osu.edu)) 
  *      Be an active participant during class 
    *           Take notes if you need to, but pay attention! 
    *           Ask questions/interact with the instructor 
    *           Challenge yourself, your classmates, _and_ your _instructor_  
  *      Take advantage of your instructor (me!) 
    *           Make sure I know your name, and help me learn it 
    *           Discuss assignments (and exams) with me BEFORE they are due 
    *           Utilize my availability via office hours and e-mail 
  *      Challenge yourself to do more than "get by." This isn't your run-of-the-mill stats class!

  
**Course Policies ***

     It is expected that exams will be taken when they are scheduled. Make-up exams will only be given in extreme situations with prior permission. Failure to take an exam without approval results in a zero for that test.  Late assignments will be lowered by one letter grade (10%) each weekday that they are late.    
     I strongly encourage you to come to every class meeting.  Attendance is not graded directly, but it is an important component of this course.  Some testable material will be presented in class that cannot be found in the textbooks.    
     All of the work you do in this course is expected to be your own. Absolutely no cheating or plagiarism (using someone else's words or ideas without proper citation) will be tolerated.  Any cases will be reported to the Committee on Academic Misconduct and handled according to University policy. Paraphrasing others' words is   
fine and often helpful; just be sure to credit the original source.  
     Students with disabilities are responsible for making their needs known to the instructor and seeking available assistance in a timely manner. Course materials are available in alternative formats upon request.

# 1\. Course Prerequisites

This course has the following prerequisite structure:

  * Operating Systems (4003-713), which requires: 
    * Computer Organization (4003-704) 
  * Programming Practices (4003-707) 
  * Introduction to Digital Design (4003-708) 

These are **prerequisites** , not **corequisites** \- to succeed in Computer
Architecture, you should have **already passed** all of these courses, or
their equivalents. Taking them at the same time as Computer Architecture **is
not sufficient!** See me immediately if you are missing one or more of the
prerequisites, or _**you may be dropped from Computer Architecture without
further warning!**_

# 2\. Books

The required textbook for this course is _Computer Architecture - A
Quantitative Approach_ , Second Edition, by John Hennessy & David Patterson;
Morgan Kaufmann, 1996. Make sure you get the **second** edition, as there are
significant changes from the first edition.

Not all of the material we will cover this quarter comes from this text; you
will have to depend on handouts and class notes for the other material.

The programming assignments for this course must be done in C++. Although one
is not required, having a C++ textbook is a good idea. One good reference is
_C++: How To Program_ , by Deitel & Deitel; Prentice-Hall.

# 3\. Grades

Your final grade will be based on three components: a midterm exam, a final
exam, and a series of programming assignments. In addition, homework
assignments will be made to give you the opportunity to practice various
techniques. The distribution between these groups is:

  | 25% | midterm exam,  
---|---|---  
  | 25% | final exam,  
  | 50% | projects  
  
## 3.1. Exams

Two exams will be scheduled for this course. The first is a two-hour midterm
exam; the second, a two-hour exam during finals week. The second exam will not
be comprehensive. As a somewhat deeper understanding of the material is
expected of graduate students, the graduate and undergraduate versions of the
exams may not be the same.

Currently, the best guess as to the dates of these exams are:

  * Exam 1: **Monday, January 21, 2002, 6:00-8:00pm, in 08-1305**   
  

  * Exam 2: **Monday, February 25, 2001, 6:00-8:00pm, in 08-1305** 

## 3.2. Projects

There will be three programming projects this quarter; as with exams,
undergraduate and graduate project requirements may be different.

Programming projects will be done using a component simulation class library
written in C++. This means that you must be able to do some elementary C++
programming. If you do not already know how to program in C++ or another
object-oriented language, _please let me know as soon as possible!_

## 3.3. Homework

Homework will be  posted to the course home page.

The homework questions will be largely quantitative analysis questions,
similar to the style of our text book. They will not be given on a regular
basis, but will be assigned when needed. Solutions will be passed out  later.
Note that homework assignments are not required; I still recommend that you do
them because they provide a good resource to help you prepare for the exams.

# 4\. Academic Honesty

I will not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty. The following is an
excerpt from the _1998-99 RIT Students Rights & Responsibilities_ handbook:

> Any act of improperly representing another person's work as one's own is
construed as an act of academic dishonesty. These acts include, but are not
limited to, plagiarism in any form, or use of information and materials not
authorized by the instructor during an examination.

>

> If a faculty member judges a student to be guilty of some form of academic
dishonesty, the student may be given a failing grade for that piece of work or
for the course, depending upon the severity of the misconduct.

Furthermore, the Department of Computer Science has adopted this [ Policy on
Academic Dishonesty](http://www.cs.rit.edu/doc/policy-dishonesty.shtml).

# 5\. Notes

  * **_Coursework:_** Unless otherwise specified in the assignment, all work you submit for grading must be your own. Code or ideas (specific algorithms, optimizations, etc.) obtained from or inspired by other sources must be properly attributed. 
  * **_Withdrawing:_** During the add/drop period (the first six days of the quarter), you may drop this course and it will disappear from your transcript. After that time, you can only withdraw from the course; the course will appear on your transcript with a grade of `W`. This quarter's deadline for withdrawing from courses is **Friday, January 25, 2002**. 
  * **_Examinations:_** If you are unable to take an examination for a good reason (by my standards), I expect to be notified **_BEFORE_** the exam takes place. Exams will be handed back to be gone over during class; they will then be collected and kept in my office. 
  * **_Project submission:_** Programming project solutions are to be submitted electronically by 11:59:59pm on the specified due date. Any day of the week is a valid due date. If hardcopy of your program, output and/or documentation are due, they are to be turned in at the beginning of the following class period.  **_DO NOT SLIDE ASSIGNMENTS UNDER MY OFFICE DOOR!_**
  * **_Grading:_**
    * This is a graduate core course. _Think about what this should mean to you._ You will be expected to incorporate all you have learned so far into this course; ie., you will lose points for sloppy, undocumented, unstructured code in a programming project submission, not following instructions, etc. 
    * Late submissions are generally not accepted without my prior approval. 
    * Your project submissions may be graded by a grader. If so, and you have complaints about your grade, first talk to the grader. If you are still convinced there is a problem and you are unable to convince the grader, come and see me. 
  * **_Warning:_** This course requires a significant amount of programming. You may wish to (re)consider whether you want to take any other programming course(s) along with it.

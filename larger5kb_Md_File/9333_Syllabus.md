**_Course Objective:_**

The aim of this course is to provide an in-depth sociological survey of
selected issues and problems of contemporary Southeast Asia (the countries of
Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei,
Indonesia, and the Philippines). The contemporary issues include political and
economic development, demographic change, ethnic relations, and human rights.
Since present conditions have been shaped by history, much of the first half
of the course focuses on understanding the social, cultural, and political
institutions of precolonial and colonial Southeast Asia.  


**_Books:_**

Mary Somers Heidhues. 2000. Southeast Asia: A Concise History. London: Thames
and Hudson.

Anthony Reid. 1990. Southeast Asia in the Age of Commerce: 1450-1680. Volume
1: Land Below the Winds. New Haven: Yale University Press.

in Southeast Asia. New Haven: Yale University Press.

Additional readings are available online from the course homepage.

**_Evaluation and Grading:_**

There will be a mid term exam on Friday, February 8th. The mid term will cover
the readings for the first five weeks (primarily the books by Somers Heidhues,
Reid, and Scott) and will also include questions on map identification. The
final exam will cover materials from the entire course and is scheduled for
2:30-4:20 pm on Wednesday, March 20\.

Students in the course must also write a term paper (about 20 pages) due on
the last day of the course. Students will also be expected to make
presentations on their papers during the last week of the course. Term papers
should focus on one of the themes from the second half of the source and
compare at least two Southeast Asian countries. Students must make an
appointment to meet with me during the first three weeks of a course to
discuss possible term paper topics. A one page outline of the term paper with
at least five possible references must be handed in by February 18. Final
course grades will computed as a weighted average of the exams (30% for each)
and the term paper (40%).

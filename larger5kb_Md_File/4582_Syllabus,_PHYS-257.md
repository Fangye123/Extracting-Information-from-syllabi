This course will introduce many scientific concepts that shape our
understanding of the physical world. A dynamic and changing Earth has formed
every piece of natural landscape around us. However, most of these changes are
not noticeable during the span of a human lifetime. They happen over thousands
or millions of years.

The first part of this course will examine geological time, the composition
and history of rocks/minerals, plate tectonics, hydrological cycle, and
weathering. Many of these subjects will be discussed with particular attention
given to their relevance within the construction industry. The latter part of
the course is devoted to the product of weathering (and plant decay) - soil.

Soil mechanics is the study of how soil will physically behave when subjected
to external influences or forces. This course will look at soil
characterization (i.e. laboratory and field-testing),
settlement/consolidation, compaction, bearing capacity, and OSHA safety
requirements for excavations. Mathematical equations will be used when they
are fundamentally important to working with a concept. Applications of
geotechnical analysis will be emphasized throughout this course. This includes
the study of dating techniques, seismic analysis, surface and ground water,
slope stability, and the engineering aspects of soils.

Course Grade:** Your course grade will be weighted according to the following
percentages:

                        21% Applied Geomechanics Activities   
                        16% Class Participation  
                        21% Exam 1 (February 25)  
                        21% Exam 2 (April 8)  
                        21% Final Exam (Monday, May 13, 12-1:50pm)

The **geomechanics activities** will be either in-class or take home
assignments. They will consist of numbered exercises. One of the exercises,
within each geomechanics activity, will be graded on a 5 point scale. If _all_
the other exercises have been completed one additional point will be given to
the score. The in-class activities will be due at the end of the class period.
The take home assignments are due at the beginning of class time on their due
date.

There will be several **class participation** activities during the semester.
They will consist of a question that will be answered by a group effort.   The
class will break into groups of no larger than 5 people and no smaller than 2.
Each group will answer the question as a team effort using [this
form](class_part.htm).  Each person in the group will receive 2 points for
completing the exercise.  Each person - in the group with the best argument -
will receive 3 points (completion plus one additional point).  At the end of
the semester, all students receiving a total points equivalent to receiving a
score of 2 on each activity, will receive a letter grade of an 'A' for this
activity.  Scores below this number of points will be graded on a curve.   (
_This is mainly an attendance grade.   Simply by completing the activities you
will receive an 'A' for 16% of your course grade_.)  This activity will be
completed in about 30 minutes.  I reserve the right to give no group 3 points
if all groups have given incorrect or poor arguments.

**Exams**

The exams will be 50% multiple choice and 50% short answer problems.  The
topics covered on the exams will be announced in lecture prior to the exams.
Scores will be posted onto the web from time-to-time.  These scores will be
listed by a random student code assigned on the first exam.

_No_ late geomechanics activities accepted and no makeup class participation.
If an exam is unavoidably missed (with a legitimate excuse), then an essay
makeup exam will be given. Only in cases for extenuating circumstances
(documentation required) are exceptions made.

Recommendations:**

About 80% of the class presentation materials (or lecture notes) are on the
Geology Web Pages. I would recommend that you read the lecture notes on the
web before it is presented in class. By doing this you will know what is or is
not on the web and can ask questions about topics that you didn't clearly
understand. You may find it advantageous to download all the lecture notes
(Not all the lecture notes are directly contained in the Sections web pages.
Some may be linked to the Sections web page.) and place them into a 3-ring
notebook. This way you can follow along with the lecture without being pre-
occupied with writing the lecture notes down. _**Be careful** \- having the
lecture notes on the web will either enhance your ability to learn the
material or make it easier to procrastinate and fall behind. Nothing can be
learned without taking time to concentrate hard on the subject matter - be it
out of a book or on the web. _ The computers in rooms 115 and 111 are
available for you to use to access the WWW during open laboratory. The open
laboratory times are posted outside the door and on the [physics department
home page](http://physics.uwstout.edu/). There are many other computers on
campus with WWW access that you can use.

Keep up with your reading and assignments. If you are having difficulty with a
particular concept or problem, please come and see me. I will be glad to help
out! I can provide you with an estimate of your current grade in the class at
any time if you stop into my office and request it. I grade on a curve. Such
that, you will receive a numerical grade on the course work and exams and then
I will determine where on the numerical grading to make the letter grade
boundaries. I will be considering many factors in determining these
boundaries.

I encourage you to work together on assignments and studying for quizzes and
exams. However, do **not** copy verbatim (or mostly verbatim in my judgment)
another person's work. Academic dishonesty will be dealt with harshly.
Copying another student's solutions for geomechanics activities and placing
your name on it **is dishonest**!   [[UW-System Academic Student
Code](http://www.wisc.edu/students/uws14.htm)]  Feel free to utilize the
discussion forum found on the geology home page. This is mainly a service to
you. Suppose you were working on a geomechanics assignment and found a small
part of it difficult. You may want to ask for assistance in the discussion
forum by posting a question and hope another student will provide assistance.
"Wholesale" solutions are not to be posted on the discussion forum (abuse of
the forum may get the privilege revoked). I may read the forum discussion from
time-to-time, but the main way to communicate with me outside of class is by
email.

If you have a special circumstance such as a visual or hearing impairment,
please stop into my office and we'll discuss ways in which your learning
environment can be optimized.

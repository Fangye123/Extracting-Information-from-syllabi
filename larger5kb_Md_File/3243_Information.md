Science 12, Introduction to International Politics, is aimed at introducing
students to the fundamental concepts, theories, and methods utilized in
studying international politics. By the end of the term students are expected
to have a more sophisticated and systematic outlook of international politics.
The course is divided into four parts. Part I deals, after a brief discussion
of the historical evolution of different international systems, with theories
and approaches that are utilized to study international politics. Part II will
examine some primary sources of conflict in global politics. In Part III we
will explore and examine the utility of diplomacy, international law, arms
control and other means in promoting global peace. Part IV will finally deal
with sources of conflict and cooperation in contemporary International
Political Economy. In particular, we will look at the North-South relations.
The gap between rich and poor countries remains wide, and poverty and
authoritarianism continue to persist in most developing countries.  
  
All students are required to purchase the two assigned books and to do the
reading assignments prior to class meetings. Students must also read the New
York Times on daily basis and be prepared to make intelligent comments on
major issues of world events. This will encourage you to develop a habit of
keeping up with world events in global politics. This should also help you
better understand the relevance of academic learning to the actual process of
decision making in both domestic and international politics. Regular
attendance and participation is required in this class. I will randomly call
on students to give short oral reports on assigned readings from either the
"Taking Sides" or the New York Times. The "lucky" student whose name is called
will highlight the important points underlined in the article(s), followed by
a class discussion involving all students in the class. Those students whose
names are called and are not present will be penalized. Class attendance and
participation will contribute 10% to your final grade. Please note that class
lectures do not necessarily follow the same exact materials discussed in the
book. However, students are responsible for both the assigned reading
materials and what is covered in class lectures. The precise outline of the
topics included in this class is provided below. We will try to follow the
outlined schedule, but I will inform you of necessary amendments should there
be any. There will be no make-up exams given unless a prior written notice is
provided by the student, explaining the circumstances under which he or she is
forced to miss an exam. Make up exams will be substantially harder.  
REQUIRED BOOKS:  

  1. Rourke, John T., International Politics on the World Stage, 5th ed. (Guilford, CT: Dushkin Publishing Group, 1995).

EXAMINATIONS AND GRADING:  
Your final grade will be based on three examinations (60%), class
presentations/participation (10%) and a 7-10 page term paper (30%). Each exam
contributes 20% to your final grade. The term paper must deal with an
important international issue, the subject of which must be approved by me. I
will provide you with a guideline as how to approach this research paper. In
terms of examinations, they will consist of both multiple choice and short
essay questions. The calculation of your final grade is thus based on the
following:  
| EXAM I (20%)| 60 points  
---|---  
EXAM II (20%)| 60 points  
FINAL (20%)| 60 points

**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
The goal of this course is to enrich our understanding of contemporary
politics in the Middle East. The core objective of the course deals with the
question of "how Middle Eastern is politics in the Middle East?" Although
there are many characteristics particular to the region that make
specialization in politics of the region necessary, Middle Eastern
governments, as well as people, are part of the developing world. To this end,
we will concentrate on selected topics that are pertinent to understanding
politics in this region within the broader context of
comparative/international politics. Given the time constraints and many issues
to cover, our approach will be broad and general rather than narrow and
focused. Students should be aware that there is a great deal of reading
involved int his class, and they are expected to actively participate in class
discussions. Students will be asked to summarize reading materials pertinent
to class lectures and discussions and to give oral presentations. Among
important topics we shall deal with are: (1) Islam and Politics; (2) The
Impact of Colonialism; (3) The State-Society relations; (4) Civil Society and
Democracy; (5) Arab (Palestinian)-Israeli conflict; and, (6) The U.S. foreign
policy toward the Middle East.  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**  
All students are required to do the reading assignments prior to class
meetings. Class participation is highly recommended as it will contribute 10%
to your final grade. I will randomly call on students to comment on particular
issues addressed both in class lectures and the recommended readings. Please
note that class lectures do not necessarily follow the same exact materials
discussed in the assigned books. Students are, however, responsible for both
the specified reading requirements and the materials covered in class
lectures.  
  
students are required to write a well-researched term paper for this class. An
abstract of your paper is due by the end of Week Four. Beginning approximately
in Week Seven, each student will give a brief presentation (approx. 10
minutes) of his/her research paper, outlining the research question,
methodology, and the preliminary findings of the paper. Research papers are
due no later than the last day of classes (Friday, March 14). Late papers will
be penalized.  
  
The precise outline of topics and reading assignments for each week is
provided for your use. We will try to follow the outlined schedule, but I will
inform you of necessary amendments should there be any. There will be no make-
up exams given unless a prior written notice is provided by the student,
explaining the circumstances under which he or she is forced to miss an exam.
Make up exams will be substantially harder.  
  
**EXAMINATIONS AND GRADING:**  
Your final grade will be based on two examinations (40%), class participation
(10%) and a 15-20 page term paper (50%). Both midterm and final exams are
weighed equally; each contributes 20% to your final grade. The term paper must
deal with a topic of interest and importance to the Middle East, the subject
of which must be approved by me. Exams will consist of short and long essay
questions. The final calculation of your grade is, thus, based on following:  
  
Midterm| \---| 20%  
---|---|---  
FINAL| \---| 20%  
CLASS PRESENTATIONS/| \---| 10%  
PARTICIPATION| |  
TERM PAPER| \---| 50%

**COURSE OUTLINE**  
This class will deal with the study and analysis of basic issues in
international relations and foreign policy. The primary objective of the
course is to familiarize students with the major concepts, theories, and
approaches that students of political science utilize to study foreign policy.
We will focus our attention on the US foreign policy in the post WWII era,
ending the course with an evaluation of the US past performances, and
prospects for the future. The course is divided into three parts. In Part I we
will study and discuss analytical perspectives on American foreign policy by
examining theories and approaches that are utilized in the field of
international relations to study foreign policy. Part II will trace back the
patterns of American foreign policy in the post WWII era to the present time.
Part III will be devoted to the study of both domestic (societal,
governmental, individual) and external (international) forces that are
responsible, to varying degrees, for the formation of American Foreign Policy.  
  
Students are required to do the reading assignment prior to each class
meeting. There is a substantial amount of reading involved in this class;
there are four books and a reading package, consisting of 41 articles. In
addition to regular class participation, students are asked for an in-class
research paper presentation and a brief written assignment on cases of U.S.
military/covert intervention abroad. Students will be divided into groups and
one elected student will present the findings of his/her group. I will provide
you with more information about this assignment later. Students also will be
randomly called upon to comment on particular issues addressed in both class
lectures and the readings. Please note that class lectures do not necessarily
follow the same exact materials discussed in the assigned books. Students are,
however, responsible for both the specified reading requirements and the
materials covered in class lectures.  
  
The precise outline of topics and reading assignments for each week is
provided for your use. We will try to follow the outlined schedule, but I will
inform you of necessary amendments should there be any. There will be no make-

The Post-Cold War era is filled with optimism and promises of prosperity and
development for all countries of the globe. A closer look at the international
political economy, however, points to very serious challenges that lay ahead.
The majority of the people in the world still live in poverty and in countries
where prospects for development are not as promising as those in the
industrialized democracies. "Economic development" remains, nevertheless, the
primary goal of political elites in most developing countries. On the
political front, many of developing countries are dominated by authoritarian
regimes, with military playing a central role in politics. Political democracy
is a luxury that many of the developing countries can not afford. The advanced
industrialized democracies of the West also have their share of economic and
political challenges (e.g. structural adjustment, the environment, nuclear
proliferation, etc.).  
  
The primary goal of this class is to introduce students to the fundamental
theories as well as debates and issues revolving around the study of
International Political Economy (IPE). In oreder to do so, we will first look
at the historical and contemporary developments in IPE. Part two of the course
will study and analyze the theories of IPE and their relevance to the actual
issues of importance to international actors.  
  
There is a substantial amount of reading requirement, and students are
expected to read the assignments in advance and actively participate in class
discussions. Students will be randomly called upon to give brief summaries of
the articles assigned. Note that 15% of your final grade will depend on how
much your participation in class help the rest of us learn. Students should
also note that class lectures do not necessarily follow the same exact
materials discussed in the book. However, students are responsible for both
the assigned reading requirements and materials covered in class lectures. The
precise outline of the topics covered in this class is provided for your use.
I will try to follow the outlined schedule, but will inform you of any
necessary amendments should there be any.  
  

**Course Requirements and Grading:**  

Your final grade will be determined based on midterm and final essay exams,
class participation, including an oral class presentation on a specific
research topic, and a research paper. I will hand out a list of essay
questions in advance and will select some of the same questions for your in-
class examinations. The topic of your research paper must be approved by me.
The midterm (15%) and final exam (20%) will contribute a total of 35% to your
final grade. The research paper is worth 50% of your final grade. Attendance
and participation (plus the oral presentation) will take care of the remaining
15% . Hence, the final grade is calculated based on the following:

  
| Midterm examination| 30 points| 15%  
---|---|---  
Final Examination| 40 points| 20%  
Research Paper| 100 points| 50%  
Class Participation & Presentation| 30 points| 15%  
| A| Grade Range| 200 - 185  
---|---|---

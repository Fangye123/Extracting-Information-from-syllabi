**_Understanding Global Cultures:_** ** _  
Metaphorical Journeys Through 23 Nations_ ** _, Second Edition_**  
**

**Author:[Martin J. Gannon](http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/mao/faculty/mgannon/) :
University of Maryland  
**

**Published By: SAGE Publications Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, London, New Delhi  
  
Pages: 472

**Paperback (0761913297):  October 2000, $34.95 **

**Description: **

**This book describes a method, the cultural metaphor, for understanding
easily and quickly the cultural mindset of a nation and comparing it to those
of other nations. In essence, the method involves identifying some phenomenon,
activity or institution of a nation 's culture that all or most of its members
consider to be very important and which they identify closely. Metaphors are
not stereotypes. Rather, they rely upon the features of one critical
phenomenon in a society to describe the entire society. The characteristics of
the metaphor then become the basis for describing and understanding the
essential features of the society. For example, the Italians invented the
opera and love it passionately. Five key characteristics of the opera are the
overture, spectacle and pageantry, voice, exteriority, and the interaction
between the lead singers and the chorus. These features are used to describe
Italy and its cultural mindset. Thus the metaphor is a guide or map that helps
the student of foreigner understand quickly what members of a society consider
to be very important.  **

**In the new edition of _Understanding Global Cultures_ the generic types of
cultural frameworks developed by Triandis and Fiske, and the torn and cleft
culture framework developed by Huntington, form the underpinning of the book.
These frameworks allow the reader to gain new insight into various cultural
metaphors and to begin to address the challenging issue of integrating
cultural and economic perspectives.  **

**Paperback (ISBN 0-534-55648-5):  2002, $26.95 **

**Description: **

**The book is intended for use as a supplement for courses in cultural
anthropology, sociology, history, English, and American studies. It is
designed for any course where the goal is to show remarkable aspects of our
U.S. culture. The book covers the subjects of family, kinship, class, and
language. It is valuable to professors who want to teach such topics as
ethnocentrism and relativism, the problems of cross-cultural experiences, and
the ethnographic method.**

**Anthropology has a long history of the "other," yet we can look right here
at home for the strangeness we seek. We often neglect to ask the questions
that reveal our own culture's underlying value and beliefs. In this volume, we
bring the American culture into focus. For students to understand the full
impact of ethnography, to experience cultural relativity and to gain a
foundation to build informed comparisons, students need a firm grasp of their
own culture--and need to use this volume. The Third Edition consists of 19
essays written by anthropologists and other scholars using an ethnographic
perspective. The essays enable students to understand themselves better by
focusing on their own culture and seeing it from a new perspective. This
collection gives anthropology a comparative perspective that provides a
reflective lens, a mirror, for understanding ourselves and the world in which
we live.**

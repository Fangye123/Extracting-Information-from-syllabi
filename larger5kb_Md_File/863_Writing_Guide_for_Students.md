##  
Writing Guide for 21H.301, 302 Students

* * *

## Requirements

  1. **You must develop your own topic.** Neither your recitation leader nor I will assign you a paper topic. We will be available to discuss potential topics at scheduled office hours and by appointment. But you must be ready; you should have notes, an outline, possible theses, etc. So, if you think you would like to write a paper called "Ancient Greece/Rome" you are not ready to come see us. If you would like to write about the development of Greek/Roman law, but are not sure how to focus your paper, come on in. 

  2. **Your paper must state a thesis clearly on the first page.** Papers without theses will be returned without grades, and must be re-written. 

  3. **Your argument must be rooted in and cite specifics from the assigned texts.** Mass your data. Make your claims. Defend them. You are not masters of all facets of Greek/Roman history. Build a case from what you _do_ know. Papers that do not cite from the assigned readings will receive an F. See [21h.301 Policies](http://web.mit.edu/21h.301/www/policies.html) / [21h.302 Policies](http://web.mit.edu/21h.302/www/policies.html). 

  4. **No outside research is expected or required,** but if you do choose to do outside reading, you must supply proper citations (footnotes, parenthetical references, Works Cited page). Feel free to use images, translations of Greek and Latin texts, etc. from the web (include URL). You _may not_ use non-refereed materials from the web. Use of non-refereed materials from the web will result in loss of one letter grade per source. If you don't know the difference between refereed and non-, ask me or your recitation leader. 

  5. **Formatting:** Typed, double-spaced, 11-12 pt. font, reasonable margins (1 inch), stapled, titled, pages numbered. Papers _may not_ be turned in by floppy, e-mail or other digital media. Your name, course name, recitation leader's name, and the date should appear single-spaced on the first page. A bibliography page is unneccessary unless you cite from secondary sources. Proofread your paper for mechanical and grammatical errors. Content impresses. Do not use cover sheets, plastic binders, folders, or silly fonts.  
  
A five-page paper should be five pages, not 4 pp. and 1 paragraph, not 5 pp.
with a first  page that starts halfway down. One deficient page costs one
letter grade. You are not the first to notice the magical effects of fat
margins, triple-spacing, fixed-width fonts and other paper-lengthening
gimmicks. Use them at your own risk.

## Procedure

### A. Getting started

Write a first draft. Do not hand in a first draft. Writing takes time. Give
yourself plenty of it. Review your notes from lectures and recitations,
brainstorm, test potential theses on classmates, roommates, me, your
recitation leader, etc., outline, write, and revise. If you are having trouble
getting started, you might try the following:

  * **The trash draft:** Once you have a topic, (1) spend 30 minutes writing down everything you can think of that relates to the topic. (2) Do something else for a couple hours, then (3) go back and underline the parts that seem worthwhile or interesting on a second reading. (4) Write a new draft based on the underlined bits. Repeat steps 2-4. A specific direction for your paper is likely to emerge from this process. 

  * **The hidden thesis:** Write a first draft based on a preliminary thesis, then use the conclusion to that draft as the introduction to the next draft. Remember, if you discover a better thesis in the course of writing, just dump the original; you are not bound to it. 

### B. Thesis and Conclusion

  * The first paragraph _must_ state a thesis. A thesis is not a hunch, feeling, opinion. It is a potentially falsifiable claim that you make and defend on the strength of the evidence as you understand it. Every paragraph should contribute directly to the argument. 

  * A conclusion is not a summary. It should persuade the reader that you have discovered and discussed something important. 

### C. Things to Avoid

  * A comparison-contrast paper is not a paper. A paper with the following structure will not succeed:  
  

    * Homer / Sallust feels one way about cheese and Herodotus / Tacitus feels another way;
      * list all episodes in Homer / Sallust that feature cheese
      * list all episodes in Herodotus / Tacitus that feature cheese
    * See, Homer / Sallust feels one way about cheese and Herodotus / Tacitus feels another way  

> Rather, claim that Greek/Roman attitudes about cheese were transformed in
the Archaic/Republican and Early Classical/imperial periods, as the different
treatments in Homer/Sallust and Herodotus/Livy show, for reasons Y and Z.
Evidence is interesting insofar as you make it so, by applying an intellectual
framework.

  * Do not spew lists. "Many social and political factors inform Achilles'/Aeneas' behavior in the _Iliad_ / _Aenei_ d," is a poor thesis. It imposes a list-like structure on your paper.   
  

  * Plot summary is not argument. Think of your classmates as your audience. They know the plot.   
  

  * Avoid panegyric: "One of the most important books in Western Civilization is Homer's _Iliad_ / Vergil's _Aeneid_ " The book is important to the extent that you make it so. 

### D. Use and Documentation of Sources

Ground your arguments in the sources. Do not refer to the difference between
Athenian and Spartan foreign policy without citing a specific example or
three.

  * **Parenthetical reference:** Refer to events or factual information by parenthetical citation, e.g.:  "But Miltiades' stay in the Chersonese was cut short by the prospect of conflict with the Scythians ( _Herodotus_ 6.40-41). "

  * **Short quotation with parenthetical reference:** Integrate short quotations: 

> Socrates introduces wage-earners as the class of people who have muscle,
"but nothing particular in their minds which makes them worthy to be partners"
(Plato, _Republic_ II = _Great Dialogues_ p. 168).

  * **Use Long Quotations (more than 3 lines) sparingly.** I am interested in what _you_ have to say. If it is _essential_ to quote a long string of text please observe the following rules: indent paragraph, single space, no quotation marks, blank line before and after quotation, parenthetical reference at end of quotation or end of preceding paragraph in the body of the text.

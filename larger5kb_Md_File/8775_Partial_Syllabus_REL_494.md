This is a partial syllabus for REL 494.

Spring Semester, 1999  
RELIGION 494:  Advanced Near Eastern and Mediterranean Archaeology

**There are no prerequisites for this course.**

Location: THH B9   Class Meetings: Tues & Thurs 9:30-10:50 AM

* * *

  
**Course Description:**  
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the study of archaeology
and excavated artifacts from the Ancient Near East with special reference to
the lands of the Bible (Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Syria,
Iraq, Iran, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Libya).  Through a combination of lectures,
discussions, and an independent research project based on the USC
Archaeological Research Collection, students gain an understanding of major
archaeological discoveries, excavation methods,  and the history, religion,
art and geography of the Ancient Near East.   The Archaeological Research
Collection will be used extensively both during lectures for illustrations and
directly by the students for hands-on study, conservation and documentation
projects.  Throughout, students will explore how archaeology and textual
(including biblical) history dialogue with each other as independent sources
that have been used to illustrate, amplify and adjust readings of the ancient
past.

Generally, classes will be divided into two parts.  The first part will be a
lecture and the second half will include a "hands-on" component with students
working with the objects in the collection, either on registration of new
objects to learn the characteristics of objects from various places and times,
conservation and repair of objects, or work on research for presentations.

This course is the second of a two-part series (which can be taken in any
order) along with REL 394 (Near Eastern and Mediterranean Archaeology) given
in the Spring semester.  Between the two courses the history of the Ancient
Near East from the development of agriculture onward through the Roman period
will be covered.  In both courses, students will work with ancient artifacts
in the research collection.  This course also gives you a good background for
the Spring 2000 course REL 499: Special Topic:  Practical Archaeology: Digging
Megiddo...Excavating Armageddon at the Millennium.  That course is a great
set-up for going on the USC archaeological dig in ISRAEL in the Summer of
2000!

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING PERCENTAGES:**

**There are no written final or midterm examinations for this course**.   You
should pay special attention to the Schedule of Assignments that follows for
the due dates of the assignments.  Also, you must have (or acquire) an e-mail
account and access to the world wide web (internet) to participate in this
class.  If you need help with this, talk to me;  all USC students can get one
easily.  I will frequently communicate with you via e-mail and several of your
assignments will require you to find and visit archaeological web sites and
possibly develop your own website project.

I.  **Class Participation** (30% of your grade)    300 of 1000 points  
Class and activity participation includes attending class, on-time arrival,
being prepared to take part in any class activity or discussion (by doing
readings, home assignments, including the visiting of various websites), and
completion of in-class assignments or homework.

*Attendance in class is not optional and students are responsible for the content of any missed lectures or discussions (which will show up on quizzes, and which can include information about upcoming assignments).  You will receive a zero for any class not attended unless you notify me in advance that you cannot be in class. Your class participation grade is computed as follows:   
(1)  participation in two off-campus field trips (one is to an outdoor
archaeological excavation simulation, and the second is a visit to a major
research library in Los Angeles)    (100 pts each; total 200 pts.)  
(2)  completion of the readings and in-class activities (evidence of this is
your active, intelligent participation in class discussions and completion of
class activities).  You receive a numeric grade for each of the class
meetings;  these are added up on a scale of 100 possible pts.

II.  **Four**   **quizzes** (up to two of these may be take-home assignments)
(30% of your grade) 75 pts each, total 300 of 1000 pts.  
Quizzes will include short answers to questions, with occasional multiple
choice questions and identification of locations on maps, or at home
assignments done using internet resources. The first map quiz is in addition
to the three graded quizzes; the first map quiz is NOT graded.

III.  **Final research project**   (8-10 pages) (40% of your grade)
400 of 1000 pts.  
Your project must include original research and may be either  
(1) an original research paper (or web presentation) on an object in the ARC
LAB  
OR  
(2) a paper (or website presentation) explaining the details of a certain time
period or particular excavated site specifically related to objects in the ARC
LAB

In order to complete the project successfully, your presentation should follow
all the guidelines as presented in the handout titled "Characteristics of A
Successful Class Project" which will be available on the class web site.

Important:  obtain Instructor approval for your topic prior to investing any
significant amount of time in your project.  Your topic should be chosen by
the third week of class at the latest.  You will present the conclusions of
your research to the class as either a web-based or illustrated oral
presentation.

ALL STUDENTS AGREE, BY SIGNING UP FOR THIS COURSE, THAT THEIR PAPER OR
INFORMATION FROM THEIR PROJECT MAY BE PUBLISHED ON THE USC ARC LAB OR THE WSRP
WEBSITE.

ALL COURSE REQUIREMENTS MUST BE COMPLETED.  ANY REQUIREMENT LEFT INCOMPLETE AT
THE END OF THE SEMESTER, AT THE DISCRETION OF THE INSTRUCTOR,  RESULTS
AUTOMATICALLY IN A FAILING GRADE.

¡¤ **First Module: Components of a CML syllabus** --This modules lists all of
the components of a regular syllabus and describes how they should be modified
for CML use. It also looks at those components which are unique to the CML
environment such as course advertising, table of contents, site maps,
interactive course calendar, use of guest presenters, student communication
processes, research teams, plugin page, guest book, search engine, peer
access, and hardware and software requirements.(41)  
  
**Objectives**  
  
**Directions for Objectives** : The possible objectives for this module are
listed below. You may select as many objectives as you want to meet your own
needs in developing materials for a course or for personal needs and skills.
Select from the objective list at least two which you want to accomplish.
Ensure that the presentation medium is available and that it is available
during the time you wish to complete the module (some synchronous media are
only available at certain scheduled times due to a need for synchronous group
meetings). Each objective is marked as to the presentation medium which can
lead to its accomplishment.  
  
1\. Identify a component of a syllabus which you would like to have in a CML
environment which is not listed in the hypertext. Describe it briefly, two-
three paragraphs.  
2\. Describe how you would write your biography so that it would attract
students to your course. Provide an example which you have developed, which
you would put in a syllabus, illustrating how you would do it.  
3\. Construct the "Expectations for the Students" section for a syllabus which
you would develop in your discipline.  
4\. Describe five products which you would want students to develop. Briefly
describe each of the products, in student appropriate language, and indicate
how students should evaluate them so that they know that they have been
created correctly.  
5\. Describe why students should take a CML course? Write an introduction for
your course which will sell CML as a better way to teach in your discipline
than is the traditional lecture.  
6\. Describe how you would use streaming audio as a component of your CML
syllabus. Outline a streaming audio script you would use to teach the first or
introductory lesson in your CML course (about ten minutes in length).  
7\. Write a critique of this presentation now that you have participated in a
streaming audio lesson.. What could be done to make it better? Should this
kind of approach be used to teach this lesson? Explain your answers.  
8\. Given a set of example syllabi, select five ideas which you would like to
incorporate into your course syllabus. Write a paragraph on each one
explaining why it is important to CML development.  
9\. Describe the various ways in which you could do the introductory page for
a syllabus, e.g., site map, cognitive map, TOC, etc. How should we lead
students to use our introduction to show how to navigate the syllabus? Write
your best shot on how you would introduce your syllabus.  
10\. Describe how you would teach a CML course. What are the different
approaches to teaching? Which of these are appropriate for CML? Describe how
you would share your teaching method with students, use student appropriate
language.  
  
  
**Directions for the Module and Activities in Four Formats**  
  
_General Directions for Module Use_ 1\. Read the text of the module.2. Read
over the questions, responses, and/or products which you may choose to respond
to or to make.  
3\. Select the presentation/response format which you desire.  
4\. Make the responses or construct the materials as requested. Be sure to use
the return receipt requested command if you email so that you know if your
message has been received. Include your signature block in any attachment or
posting so that you will receive credit for the question and so that others
can respond to you. Also selected emails may be posted and we would like to
give credit where credit is due.  
5\. Only respond to one question in each email. (This facilitates counting!)  
6\. If you select streaming audio make sure that you have loaded the
appropriate plugin. ( **Hot link to plugin page.)**  
7\. Be sure to indicate the question, the format (e.g., hypertext module), and
the module in the header section of all postings and email. Note that this is
not needed for thread discussions but is needed for synchronous discussions.  
8\. If you find or develop a "Neat Related Idea" post it to the bulletin board
of the same name which is available with this module. **(Hot link to bulletin

**COMPONENTS OF A COMPUTER MEDIATED LEARNING (CML) SYLLABUS**  
The Computer Mediated Learning (CML) Syllabus should contain all of the
required components of the regular syllabus. These components may be included
in a list distributed annually by the administration. Include all that the
institution requires. Listed below are the regular components of a syllabus
needed to describe a course using CML and some of the possible components of a
CML Syllabus which are either unique to CML or which need to be modified for
use in CML. See
_<http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/hccinfo/facdev/WriteSyllabus.html>_.  
**Course Prefix, Number, and Title:** The course prefix, number, and title
tell the student that he/she is in the correct syllabus. Numbers may be the
same across departments, but prefixes will change. It is always important to
insure that the student knows what document he/she is in, particularly if
there are many similar documents available on the university server. Some
universities use a common syllabus format and template and it is difficult to
distinguish one course from another except by the course number and prefix.  
**Course Advertising:** When the syllabus functions as a Web page for a
course, it should begin with a segment, which advertises the course. See
_<http://www.nyu.edu:80/classes/garbage/>. _ This information should be
provided at the top of the syllabus or in a header so that it will be easily
accessible to search engines, which may only pick up the first 100-200
characters on a page. Note that you may not see what is in the header but the
search engine will. Some search engines record the whole document, others only
headers or the first segment of a page. If you are drawing students at a
distance they need to find the course first. To assist students from other
locations, include information about how to access the course, its tuition,
start date, and other necessary details. The syllabus should contain
hyperlinks to appropriate sites so interested students can find other
necessary course information such as registration forms, etc. It is necessary
up front to indicate what the minimum hardware requirements for accessing and
participating in the online course will be and which, if any, downloadable
viewers will be needed on the students' computer. Links to a download page for
a needed viewer allows the student to easily follow instructions. See
_<http://www2.ncsu.edu/bae/people/faculty/walker/hotlist/graphics.html>_. ****  
**Table of Contents:** Provide a table of contents or an index if the syllabus
has many pages or page groupings (8 or more). For an example of a main index
see _<http://sanda.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS/index.html>_. For a large syllabus
start with a flow or block diagram of the components. For example see
_<http://128.172.170.24/gj/201/201.html>_. This will allow the use of the
fewest number of levels when linking pages together. Students should not have
to go through many levels or pages to get to the specific page they need to
read. Too many levels cause learner frustration.  
**Course Map/Website Map** : The course map is an alternative to a table of
contents. Sometimes it may represent a building with a variety of locations,
for example see ( _<http://itrc.uwaterloo.ca/~engl210e/>). _ Usually a course
map is graphical rather than outlined text, which is beneficial for some
visually oriented learners. See for example _<http://www.cl.uh.edu/INST5931/>.
_ It may, in fact, be useful to provide both a course map and a table of
contents and let the students select which one they want to use. For those who
are unsure about this, try putting a counter on the table of contents and the
site map and see if they both get use. ****  
**Instructor Name, Office Hours, and Biography:** The instructor's name and
office hours tell the student who the teacher is and when he/she can be
contacted. If there are teaching assistants who may also work with the
students, they too should be listed. Electronic office hours should be listed,
if provided. In some courses with some students, the instructor may also need
to spend some space convincing students that coming to office hours, in person
or electronically, does not brand them as slow. Learners, in our competitive
society, needing help or assistance may see the receipt of that help as a sign
that they are weak or incompetent. To avoid this stigma they may not seek help
when it is needed. Provide a picture of the instructor as well as information
about research interests, background. Instructors may want to provide a
bibliography of work so students begin to feel that they know something about
them. A curriculum vita may be appropriate. **(** See
_<http://www.geog.buffalo.edu/~dmark/> _ for a bibliography of work and
curriculum vita)  
**Telephone and Email Numbers (Office and Home):** Students should be able to
contact the instructor or leave a message either with a secretary or on voice
mail. This is particularly important when beginning a course, which is Web
enhanced, as many students may have problems with equipment, which the
instructor or technical staff will need to resolve. We assume that instructors
will provide email addresses. Others, which may be included, are phone
numbers, office address, home phone number, home address, home email. Will
synchronous office hours be provided? If yes, will these be email only, chat
room, phone or in person, or some combination of the above? If asynchronous
office hours are planned, how often will the instructor logon for this
purpose? The teacher should be explicit here so that the students will know
how long they will have to wait before they will have answer questions or
address problems. The more frequently the instructor is available, the lower
students' stress levels will be and the less delay they will experience in
developing the materials, which are needed for completion of the course.
Remember that a question unresolved usually means that the student is stuck
until resolution. List days (Saturday and/or Sunday) when email will not be
checked so students will know when to expect a response. Some instructors may
want to have an electronic open door policy, but they should provide times
when they do not have to answer email.  
**Prerequisites and Support Courses:** The students should know right at the
beginning if there are other courses which they should have had before they
attempt the course. Be sure to list both those in the catalogue and those that
the instructor assumes that they have had, even if they are not required. The
latter are sometimes important because the instructor may assume knowledge,
which is not available to some of the students. In an electronic format the
instructor may wish to include a pretest which students grade or a self test
which the student would grade to insure that he/she had the appropriate
background skills and knowledge's. (
_<http://www.EDsOasis.org/Spotlight/Chaparro/Chaparro.html>_ **)** This allows
students to select out of a course if they cannot do the entry level required
work. Both the instructor and the students will feel better if this is done.
If it is not done the instructor should provide appropriate remedial
instruction as needed.  
**Access to Text Materials:** List materials the student is responsible for
acquiring: books, readings, supplies, and the like. (See
_<http://www.jec.edu/kst/index.html>_ for book acquisition) Provide full
bibliographic information with the locations at which books and readings can
be acquired. This is particularly important when learners are at a distance.
If the teacher holds copyright, articles can be directly posted to the
Internet. Other articles may be available online. For example see the Internet
Public Library _<http://www.ipl.org/>. _ If copyright is not held, password
protect the articles and post them to the Web under the educational fair use
provision of the copyright law of 1976. See copyright policy at
_<http://iron.utsystem.edu/home/OGC/IntellectualProperty/cprtpol.htm>_ and
articles at _<http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/projects/copyright/index.html>_. In
Web assisted and/or enhanced courses, the student needs to know which parts of
the course must be accessed using the computer and any alternative ways in
which materials can be acquired, e.g., in a text library. The instructor
should introduce the textbook. Are there any alternative interpretations to
the material presented? If there are alternative procedures which ones are
acceptable for examinations? How are they expected to use the text? Should it
be read before logging on? In the readings list, list all of the readings and
their locations and any materials that will be provide for the students.
Indicate the sequence in which they should be used and the time line for their
use if required. Time lines are very important if the learners have to get
certain things done by definite dates. This is particularly true when doing
collaborative learning. If a reference list is available, this should be
included also.  
**Grading Procedures:** The grading procedures should be spelled out following
university regulations. The requirements for each grade level (A, B, C) need
to be clear and defensible. How are they calculated? What is the policy on
"I's" (incomplete) and "W's" (withdrawals)? What is the last date at which a
progress report is due to the students? (Follow university regulations.)
Grading criteria for papers and projects, as well as examinations need to be
spelled out. Any additional ways to make or lose points or credit needs to be
discussed in writing. Information about the ways that grades have distributed
in the past will help students decide if the class is right for them. (See
_<http://www.ilstu.edu/~gcramsey/StatII.html>_ for a description of previous
grade distributions). The grade distribution, more than anything else,
indicates whether or not mid-range students can be successful. Posting the
grade distributions from previous semesters can draw students to the class or
they can keep enrollment numbers down, depending on the grading philosophy.
For examples of previous group projects see _<http://cdl-
flylab.sonoma.edu/edesktop/WWW_Projects/StudentProjects.html>_.  
**Course Objectives and Outline:** In a typical syllabus where the teacher
determines what the students will learn, the course objectives should be
stated and an outline of the content to be covered should be presented. This
is helpful for the student as it shows clearly what the course is supposed to
be about. Objectives usually are called goals and are more general in courses
where students have some control over the content that they will explore.
Control based systems will have objectives, usually based in Bloom's Taxonomy
(Bloom et al. 1956). Choice based courses will list the purposes for which the
course was created so that learners can have some direction in selecting among
the offerings. Typically, choice based learners will not partake of all of the
purposes unless they are highly interested. (For an example objectives page
see _<http://edutech.educ.msu.edu/vital/syllabus.html>_**.**  
**Style/Mode of Teaching** : No matter what kind of course is presented the
instructor needs to spell out how the course will be conducted. A description
of a constructivist approach in a syllabus is provided at
_<http://www.coe.uh.edu/courses/cuin7317/>_.  
In a CML course, this is extremely important as some learners may not have
access to the appropriate equipment all of the time. In Web assisted and Web-
enhanced courses the student needs to know which parts of the course must be
accessed using the computer and if there are alternative ways in which
materials can be acquired. Instructors need to specify very precisely what the
structure is (unless it is the computer is used as a lecture vehicle), because
the learners are unlikely to be familiar with all the other approaches. The
various course structures are collaborative-teacher directed, collaborative-
learner directed, individualized-t-eacher directed, individualized-learner
directed, asynchronous teacher directed, asynchronous learner directed, group
synchronous-teacher directed, group synchronous-group directed, and a variety
of combinations of these. **** A good approach here is to write a clear and
succinct description of what the learners will be doing, and then have all of
the difficult words/concepts or those that the learners might not know in the
description, linked to definitions or explanations.  
**Course Calendar, Interactive** : Fully webbed courses should have an
interactive course calendar. This allows the instructor to modify the calendar
as the course goes along. It also allows the students to suggest that they
need more instruction or exposure to the material before they go on. This is
particularly true in synchronous courses. In many classes students really want
to have some time together. In a distance learning course this can only happen
in a synchronous CML environment. The interactive schedule can be used in
conjunction with email to set up a chat room where all who want can
participate in a real time interactive process on class issues.  
**List of Key Concepts:** The list of key concepts is like a glossary of
terms. It defines the terms and provides a set of examples. See
_<http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/glossary/index.html>_. Concept lists are
helpful in CML because learners do not have to pose questions to the group or
the instructor when they do not understand. This saves time and insures that
the shy students will have some idea of what the terms mean. In control
settings (those following traditional instructional design principles) the
instructor should post the key concepts list. In collaborative settings anyone
who has had a problem with a concept or who has received an email from a
classmate along the lines of  "What the ______ _______ does this word mean?"
can post the concept, definition, and examples to the list. In collaborative
settings students should be warned that some definitions might be
idiosyncratic unless a source for the definition is provided. (See Netspeak
for Internet terms at _<http://sunsite.unc.edu/horizon/mono> /CD/_
Internet_Glossaries/lingo.html or a content based hyperglossary at
_<http://www.cryst.bbk> .ac.uk/PPS2/ glossary/index.html_ ).  
**Use of Guest Presenters** : In some disciplines there is significant use of
guest presenters as part of the instructional process. This may be continued
in the CML environment. However, the teacher will have to educate both the
presenter and the students as to how the process works. In a synchronous
environment the teacher should ask the presenter to stop frequently and ask if
there are questions. Because the participants are not usually visible there is
no body language to read and presenters may not know when students are having
difficulty. The teacher will want to brief students about what the presenter
will talk about, and to provide an advance organizer to help the students
structure the new information. In an asynchronous mode the teacher will
provide times when the presenter will respond to questions if this done on a
synchronous basis. If questions and answers are to be done asynchronously then
inform the students of how often the presenter will respond and when he/she
will no longer be available. That is, when is the last time you can ask
questions on this topic? A syllabus, which uses a quest presenter, can be
found at _<http://www.uah.edu/colleges/science/biology/crsmat/bys519.html>_.  
**Expectations (Instructor)** : The instructor should spell out any
expectations, which are held about the behavior of students or the development
of products. (See
_<http://http.ecn.bgu.edu/users/mieng/wiu/write/syllabus.htm> _ for an
example) The more the students know about what is expected the more likely the
instructor is to get it and the more likely the students are to feel that they
are successful. This means that requirements, formats, styles used, problem
structures, report formats, etc., must be spelled out in detail. When possible
provide a checklist if the process contains many steps. (For a syllabus
including an example checklist see
_<http://deil.lang.uiuc.edu/ELCI/F96s1/Syllabus/syllabus.html>_ ) The better
the product is described the happier the instructor will be with the eventual
result. Teachers should make participation expectations clear and model
responsiveness. The expectations can be set either by the teacher or during a
brainstorming session where the students talk about what must be done to set
up an environment in which all can be optimally productive. In the electronic
environment the teacher must specify the number of logons, and the number of
postings that are expected from the students for a grade of "X".  
**Examinations and Major Assignments:** The evaluation and performance
components of a course should always be spelled out. See
_<http://westgate.vut.edu.au/~cp/>. _  
This forms a contract with the student and therefore the student is able to
allocate time appropriately among courses. Examinations and major assignments
should not be changed, except in the student's favor, without agreement of the
entire class.  
_Online Examinations_ **:** If examinations are put on line, there are
programs which will randomly present multiple choice items, with a different
set for each student, and score the student responses to the items. Other
programs will reorder the response choices while leaving the stems the same.
See _<http://www.unc.edu/courses> /ssp/tips/testing.html_ for tips on online
testing. Some instructors use diagnostic examinations as part of a computer
aided assessment process where the computer controls the difficulty level of
the assessment using a hierarchical difficult item set to stretch the student
cognitively and to assess the point at which the student will fail. The
purpose of this kind of assessment is to use diagnosis testing to route the
student around material that the student knows and thereby providing
appropriate levels of challenge and difficulty. For sample online questions
see _<http://www.dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/AP-Chem/AP-Free-Resp97.html>_. If
teachers follow control methodology how will they insure security for the item
sets? This is a question that should be answered. Test security can be
maintained by using different items for each student, or by having all take
the examination online at the same time, by reordering the response choices or
by providing different orderings of the same items and controlling the access
time to the test. Can in class exams be made up? Will the same item set be
used? These are other questions, which must be answered about online
examinations.  
_Online Assignments:_ In the assignment section specify clearly what students
are to do and how they should do it. Any products, which are required or
recommended, should be described here. (See
_<http://pilot.msu.edu/user/coddejos/index.htm#tutor>_ ) This could include
products to go into portfolios as well as things that learners may be required
to turn in. There are a number of questions that the teacher should try to
answer when developing assignments to be used at a distance (Roe, 1985). What
is the purpose of the assignment? Is the assignment the best or most
appropriate way of developing the skill? Are the students aware of the purpose
of the assignment? The students will do better and will work harder on an
assignment if they know why it is used, what they are supposed to gain from
it, and how this will help them in the real world. Is learning expected from
the assignment, or is it merely practice over material which is already known?
If learning is expected, do the students know what it is that they are
supposed to learn? How can the teacher insure that learning takes place? Are
the expectations clear? Do the students know the point value of the assignment
and how this relates to the overall grade in the course? What assistance will
the instructor, provide? Is there reference material available if it is needed
for the assignment? Are the assessment criteria clear, or is self-assessment
used? Will feedback be provided? Are make up assignments allowed? Can the time
deadlines be extended? (See Web exploration assignment
_<http://pilot.msu.edu/user/coddejos/homepage.htm>_ )  
**Extra Credit opportunities:** If students are allowed to do extra work for
extra credit, these opportunities should be included in the syllabus. All
should know that the opportunities are available and under which circumstances
they can participate. Many extra credit opportunities can be linked to
resources on the Internet to provide a start for the students who are
researching them.  
**Products Requested in the Syllabus** : It is usually best to start with
products which are easily developed. Beginning with small tasks allows the
students to learn to use the technology and helps to insure that they will be
able to complete and get satisfaction from the initial tasks. Teachers should
spell out in detail all of the products that they want. The more detail
provided the more likely the student will be to be able to figure it out. This
means that the instructor will have increased likelihood of receiving the
desired product in the desired format.  
**Model Papers/Projects** : In many courses teachers will want the students to
write papers and construct projects. Examples of papers and projects should be
provided. The important point here is to show papers and projects that are in
the "B" range, not the very best ones that have been received. Students will
work hard if they think that they can be successful but few will think that
they can compete with the very best of students. List all of the requirements
and guidelines for papers and projects. The more clearly projects are
described the more likely the teacher will get it. (See the Germ at
_<http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/courses/ennc986/germ.html>_ ). In a
collaborative, multigenerational setting all of the papers and some of the
projects can be displayed on the Web to gain an authentic audience and
examples should be linked to the syllabus. Here learners create for the next
generation (classes) use, see James (1997) at
_<http://www.soc.hawaii.edu/~leonj/leonj/leonpsy/gc/generations.html>_.  
**Policy on Attendance:** Attendance policies need to be spelled out. This is
not too important in an asynchronous environment, but if class meetings are
required either in person or on the Web it is very important for students to
understand how absences will be treated. ****  
**Due Dates** : Due dates for papers, projects, problem solutions, homework,
etc. should be included in the syllabus. Here again the students will plan
based on this information so instructors should not change the dates except in
the favor of the students.  
**Add/Drop Policy:** The university's add/drop policy should be printed in the
syllabus. An example of a policy handout is available at
_<http://test.dcn.davis.ca.us/go/dquaaa/Add_Drop.html>_.  
**Fees in Addition to Tuition:** If there are any fees, e.g., lab fees,
computer charges, activity fees, and the like, these should be spelled out in
the syllabus. The rationale is that some students may not be able to pay the
fees if they are large and the student's budget is small.  
**Statement to Cover Possible Changes in the Syllabus:** The syllabus should
say that it is a contract between the instructor and the students and
therefore it will not be modified except in writing. The teacher should not
modify the syllabus in any way that will make the students at risk, e.g.,
changing exam dates, number of assignments, etc. unless the change reduces the
amount of work for the students and it has been discussed in class or on the
Internet.  
**Disabled Students:** There is usually a standard paragraph which must be
inserted for disabled students that is something like this,  "If any member of
this class feels that he/she has a disability and needs special accommodations
of any nature whatsoever, the instructor will work with you and the Office of
Student Disability Services (or other appropriate title) to provide reasonable
accommodations to ensure that you have a fair opportunity to perform in this
class. Please advise the instructor of such disability and the desired
accommodations at some point before, during, or immediately after the first
scheduled class period." (OSU Policy Statement) Are there other provisions
which you will provide for disabled students such as low vision readers, text
for audio, and so forth. These additional provisions should also be specified
in the syllabus. See example at
_<http://www.dundeecoll.ac.uk/Sections/Advice/dold.html>_.  
**Statement of Academic Integrity** : Many instructors want to have a
statement of academic integrity included in the syllabus. This is usually a
result of having students misunderstand how much they could copy of an
original work, or other experiences, which we would relate to plagiarism. It
should be remembered that young students may have been trained in an
environment where copying from an encyclopedia was appropriate. Therefore any
statement should provide examples of what should not be done and an
explanation of why it should be avoided. See statement of academic integrity
at _<http://www2.ncsu.edu/ncsu/provost/info/hat/current/ch05/0604.html>_.  
**University Policies** : Some institutions require or recommend that
instructors include a variety of university policies in the syllabus. These
can easily be incorporated into the syllabus or linked to it depending on what
is required. Do not link the students to all university policies if they are
on the local area network (LAN). Only point them to those that are appropriate
for students.  
**Student Roster and Communication:** To enhance communication between
students, provide a student roster with students' email addresses and other
contact information the students themselves provide. From this list the
teacher can produce a listserv for sending broadcast messages to the whole
class when appropriate. For collaborative courses, the student address list is
essential for students to share their work, comments, and questions, and so
forth with others. Most collaborative projects will require whole class or
team interaction as well as one-on-one interaction. Listservs and email for
private messages can accomplish this very well. Teachers may also wish to have
a chat room or other synchronous interaction space to allow students to
interact in real time. (
_<http://www.specialeffects.com/~mandel/ircinfo.html>_ ) Students should be
asked to provide their email addresses. Those who volunteer can also include
their telephone numbers and addresses. However this should not be a
requirement, some will want privacy. Instructors will want to provide email
for students who do not have it and a listserv for sending broadcast messages
if this is appropriate. Most collaborative projects will require whole class
or team interaction as well as one-on-one interaction. Teachers may wish to
have a chat room or other synchronous interaction space, if they want students
to interact in real time. For mass message sharing, a listserv is most
appropriate.  
**Research Teams** : Some courses will be structured so that students, working
under faculty guidance, will form research teams. These teams may work on
class projects or they may be recruited from majors across classes. When the
latter is done a research teams page should have advertisements listing the
skills that the teams need (assuming that partial teams have been created) if
all teams are starting afresh. It is very important for some teams to have
specific skills these should be highlighted. Teams may create their own
research projects or the teacher may provide projects for them in various
stages of completion. See how to do research at
_<http://www.itools.com/research-it/research-it.html>_. Teachers may want to
have students become involved in data collection and dissemination Note that
this may require Institutional Review Board (IRB) permission if human subjects
are used. (See _<http://www.osu-
ours.okstate.edu/osuresre/comcer/humansub.htm>_ for an example IRB form). This
can be facilitated by having students conduct database collection, electronic
publishing, information exchange, pooled data analysis, and by taking tele-
fieldtrips. The latter is particularly useful in art history with the advent
of virtual museums. As students collect their own data the teacher may
introduce the concept of  "just-in-time learning". This idea comes from
manufacturing where parts arrive at the assembly point just in time. Assembly
plants do not have to store them or hold them in inventory. Just-in-time
learning functions in the same way. We do not teach the student to learn
something and squirrel knowledge away for later use, we teach him/her how to
find information and let the information be found when it is needed. This
makes the information more interesting, authentic, and meaningful, and,
therefore, more likely to be used and remembered. As students collect new data
and need new information it can be provided in this manner.  
_Collect Data_ ** _:_** For some class projects teachers may want to collect
data on the class so that they can conduct research on data related to
themselves. This is usually done to increase student interest and relevance of
the process. In these cases have a data collection section in the syllabus or
linked to the syllabus. This could be a questionnaire, a pretest, a discourse
history, a biography, or other numerical or non-numerical segment of
information which can be put together for student use. (This questionnaire was
linked from a geology syllabus home page _<http://www.wisdom.com/sv/sv-
inet1.htm>_ ).  
**Plug in Page** : For a complex syllabus, which is technologically,
sophisticated the teacher will need to have a plugin page. To find plugins see
_<http://www.creativegood.com/help/c064.html>_ This page would contain links
to all of the plugins that the student would need to load for the course. See
_<http://www.online.ddce.cqu.edu.au/west/config.htm>_.  
**Guest Book** : Many sites have a guest book where visitors can sign in and
leave an email address to get on a listserv which describes new happening on
the webpage. This may also serve as recruiting tools for the course the next
time it is offered. The site owner will have a list of people who were
interested enough in the course to look at it in some time during the last
semester. To set up a guest book see
_<http://www.theplanroom.com/subscribe/guestbook.html>_.  
**Search Engine** : If the site is very large or is complex the teacher may
wish to install a search engine. See
_<http://home.netscape.com/escapes/search/ntsrchdft-1.html>_.  
**List of Internet Scholars:** A teacher may also list Internet scholars who
will be available with the course at certain times. It is recommended that
teachers list when they will present and how long they will be available.  
**Lab Safety/Health Policy:** If students are required to use materials in a
laboratory course, include any health and safety rules and policies that are
required by the institution as well as any which should be impose in the CML
setting. See _<http://www.pp.okstate.edu/ehs/index.htm>_.  
**Peer access (Listserv and Individual Email** ): Peer access is usually
arranged electronically in fully webbed courses. Peers can be brought together
for discussion and collaboration in either a synchronous or and asynchronous
mode. Peer access can be controlled by the instructor, have all the messages
route through the instructor; or peer access can be student controlled through
the use of email, Listservs which all can post to, bulletin boards, or other
electronic media which students can use to communicate with their peers.
Students may provide email addresses to the instructor, to individual
classmates, or to the class as a whole. When the latter is done it should be
voluntary (some students may not want to share with everyone for privacy
reasons). Students may provide personal webpage URLs in the some courses so
that all may read about them and understand their collective backgrounds. This
is sometimes useful in the selection of teams if the students, rather than the
instructor do the team selection. **Readings/Materials/URL Lists** : Readings,
materials, and URL lists provide students with required or optional resources,
which can be used to support or extend the learning in a course. Many syllabi
will have weekly or module reading and reference lists. Reading lists contain
material, which all are expected to read and for which they are responsible.
Reference lists are more exhaustive and contain materials, which only some
students will be interested in and which only some will wish to explore. URL
lists provide links to papers and other materials on the Internet to which
students can link when information is needed. These readings may be on other
sites or they may be on the same server as the syllabus but protected behind a
firewall, with a password, for copyright reasons. See
_<http://www.cc.columbia.edu/~rosedale/>_  
**Previous grade distribution:** Providing previous grade distributions for
the course is useful in showing students who may be tentative in joining the
course that the course is one which provides an adequate number of high
grades. The grading distribution is unrelated to the rigor of the course in
most cases, it is related to the grading philosophy of the instructor. In a
control-based course the distribution should be normal or skewed to the right
(more high grades) if the course is criterion referenced. If the choice model
is used the distribution should be skewed right (more high grades) if
appropriate choices are given and the selection criteria for students is
adequate. Sophisticated students will understand these distributions and
courses with other distributional shapes will not attract as many learners at
a distance. Previous grade distribution systems, which advantage students,
particularly in the choice mode, will positively aid in recruiting students at
a distance.  
**Hardware/Software Requirements** : the level of sophistication and the
bandwidth requirements of the materials used in the course will determine
hardware and software requirements. The more
audio/video/multimedia/simulations/virtual reality that is needed the
larger/faster/newer the computer needs to be and the greater the amount of
memory is needed on the motherboard. Students will need at least a 486-model
computer if they are to deal with more than email as part of the course. If
graphics and full motion video are planned the largest available computer will
probably be needed. Modems should be at least 28.8 (KB per sec.). Faster
modems are available and may soon be able to be used remotely, off of a LAN.
However, only those, which connect

### Text

The textbook for this course is:

> _Logic Primer_ , by Colin Allen and Michael Hand (MIT Press, 1992).

At under $20.00, this text is a great buy (for which you have the authors, two
members of the A&M Philosophy Department, to thank: they wanted the publisher
to keep the price as low as possible). However, it is not a text intended for
independent study. It assumes that you actually have an instructor to supply
some explanations, discussions, enrichments, and the like. Thus, there is a
reason to come to class.

### Web Support

There is also web-based support related to this text at the Philosophy
Department's logic computing lab site (<http://logic.tamu.edu/>). In
particular, you will find there a creature called [_The Logic
Daemon_](http://logic.tamu.edu/daemon.html) with which you can check your
solutions to homework exercises, and a
[_Quizmaster_](http://logic.tamu.edu/cgi-bin/quizmaster) that will test how
well you're understanding the material. For that matter, you can read the text
itself online at <http://logic.tamu.edu/Primer/> (please note that, as the
copyright notice on that page specifies, you are not permitted to print off
copies). The course schedule further down on this page contains links to such
things as supplemental class notes. As exams are given, there will also be
links to exam results. In addition, you have secure access to your grades
(both password-protected and encrypted): see [getting your grades](getting-
your-grades.html) for the details.

### Lectures and Lab Sessions

This course (all nine sections) meets MW 8:00-8:50 for lectures (which usually
means presentations by the instructor in various more, or less, entertaining
styles). Since it's difficult to have a great deal of question-and-answer with
340 people, the class breaks down into nine sections, each with a lab time in
the Philosophy Department's Logic Teaching Lab (Bolton 019) on Thursday or
Friday. Lab sessions are your opportunity to ask your teaching assistant more
detailed questions, to work through solutions to problems, etc. You're also
welcome to use the lab at any other time (it has extended hours) except when
it's being used by another class.

### Formal course work and grading policies

Here are the formal requirements for this course:  **Exam**|  **Tentative
Date**|  **Proportion of your grade** |  Exam 1| February 21| 20% | Exam 2|
March 22| 20% | Exam 3| April 17| 20% | Final| May 5| 40%  In a sense, _all_
the exams in this course are cumulative, since the material you learn for each
exam is presupposed by the remainder of the course. I also substitute your
second-highest hourly exam grade for your lowest hourly exam grade, so you get
the opportunity to blow one exam.

#### Makeup Exams

If you really are prevented from taking an exam for reasons outside your
control, and if you give me a good account of those reasons (including
University-approved absences), then I will make arrangements for an
alternative exam time. However, it is your responsibility to tell me about
this as soon as you can. If you're ill, that means the first day you return to
class. If it's a University-approved absence, then let me know **beforehand**.

#### Homework

Doing homework is absolutely essential for learning logic, but I do _not_ keep
a record of what you've done. I'll assume you are responsible enough to do it
yourself _before_ class (that way, you'll get considerably more out of the
discussions of problems in class).

#### Attendance and Participation

I do not assign a formal percentage of your grade to attendance or class
participation. The benefit of attending class is that you learn a lot about
logic that will, among other things, be really helpful in taking the exams. If
you don't come to class, you will probably suffer.

### Academic Honesty and Its Opposite.

Academic dishonesty includes not only getting someone else to do your work
(with or without their knowledge) but also knowingly doing someone else's work
for them. This applies to take-home assignments as much as to in-class work.
Under Texas A&M's policies, students guilty of academic dishonesty may receive
lowered grades and other more severe penalties. For more details, see Section
20 of the _Texas A &M University Regulations_ (maintained on the University's
web site at <http://student-rules.tamu.edu/>).

## The Content of This Course

We will study two formal systems of logic: a simple system for sentential (or
propositional) logic, and an expanded system for predicate logic. For each of
them, we will study: (1) the formal language itself; (2) ``translation'' (of a
limited sort) from English into the formal language; (3) constructing proofs
of validity for arguments in the language; (4) a semantics, or model theory,
for the language.

### How to Study Logic

Logic isn't actually a very difficult subject. The formal languages we will be
studying are very simple---downright primitive, by comparison with natural
languages such as English. Most students will find that they can get along
pretty well in this course, provided they remember three important rules:

  1. DO THE EXERCISES. 
  2. COME TO CLASS. 
  3. DON'T GET BEHIND 
Courses in logic, like courses in mathematics or in a foreign language, are
cumulative and require that you learn certain skills. In order to learn any
skill, you've got to practice, which in this case means doing exercises.
Repetition is extremely important; you'll never succeed merely by reading
through the text. It's also essential to have some guidance on _how_ to do
logic, and that is what classes are for. Class is also the place to ask
questions about what you don't understand. And, since the material is
cumulative, it's very, very, very important to keep up: if you get behind, you
may wind up staying behind. If you find yourself having trouble with the
material, ASK FOR HELP EARLY. If you wait until April to try to catch up,
don't expect me not to say I told you so, because I just did, and so I will.
Of course, when you do exercises, you'd like to know if you are doing them
correctly. There are solutions for some of the exercises in the back of the
text, but in the case of proofs there are typically many correct solutions.
The best way to check yours is to use the _Logic Daemon_ ; this also has the
advantages that it will give you instant feedback, without charging you any
money, and that it works 24 hours a day.

### What Use Is Logic?

Among other things, formal logic aims at representing certain aspects of human
reasoning, especially those involved in such processes as deductive inference
and mathematical proof. Not surprisingly, then, logic has many applications in
areas where these aspects of reasoning are important. In the last few decades,
by far the most prominent of these has been computers, which are essentially
logic machines. But you say you're not interested in designing any computer
circuitry? Well, for most people, the largest benefit of studying formal logic
is something quite different. In order to construct deductions in a formal
logical system, you need to acquire certain skills that will turn out to be of
importance in the kind of strategic thinking you will probably need to do no
matter what your choice of career. One of these is figuring out how to reach a
desired goal with a given set of resources. Another is the habit of attending
precisely to what a statement says (and does not say). A third, more closely
linked to the application of logic to natural language, is the ability to see
important distinctions. Finally, if you acquire some appreciation for the
notion of a valid argument and for the distinction between valid and invalid
arguments, then you may find that you are not so easily swayed by the rather
large number of atrocious arguments that circulate around us every day.

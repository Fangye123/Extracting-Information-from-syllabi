### Description:

  
Irish theater critic Stephen Gwynn said of W. B. Yeats's play Cathleen ni
Houlihan, "I went home asking myself if such plays should be produced unless
one was prepared for people to go out to shoot and be shot." His comment
proved prophetic: many of the Irish men and women who fought in the 1916
Easter Rising spoke of Yeats's play as their inspiration. As this anecdote
suggests, writing and politics have been--and still are--closely and
explicitly intertwined in Ireland. In this course, we will look not only at
the literary and political responses to Ireland's history of British colonial
rule, but also the challenges to the politics of the Irish State articulated
by contemporary writers. We will explore a variety of genres, including
essays, poetry, film, and pop music; and we will examine works by a range of
authors and artists, including W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Patrick Pearse, Sean
O'Casey, J. M. Synge, Nuala ni Dhomhnaill, Seamus Heaney, U2, and Sinead
O'Connor. No prior knowledge of Irish history is expected; short historical
essays will be included in the readings.

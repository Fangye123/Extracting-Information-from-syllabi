Meteorology 302 fulfills a portion of the _Science_ requirement of the **Our
Violent Planet** cluster in Segment III of the General Education program.
This course is also a Core Course  in Area II:  **Physical Science** of the
Liberal Studies degree program.



Students should note that in order for this course to count towards fulfilling
your General Education Segment III requirement you must:  (i) fulfill the
other requirements of the cluster (found on page 174 of the _Schedule of
Classes_ ); and, (ii) be at least a Junior while taking any course in the
cluster.  The other classes in the cluster are Geology 302 (The Violent Earth)
and ONE of the following:  (a) Geography 402 (CESD) (The Climatic Challenge);
(b) Geography 600 (CESD) Environmental Problems and Solutions; and/or (c) PLSI
354 (Politics, The Environment and Social Change).



**Scope of the Course**



The general function of any course in the General Education program is to
provide students with the information which is a fundamental underpinning for
any well-educated individual.  Students may rightfully argue that they have
enough troubles filling out their majors program without the added burden of
taking on coursework which seems at best peripheral and at worst totally non-
relevant to their educational goals.  I believe that this attitude is
expedient and the end result of its implementation is that the student, upon
graduation, is not the least bit "well-rounded".  Such a student has limited
ability to make informed judgments about the issues which confront him or her
beyond those which fall into their narrow field of interest.



In the case of the present course, the instructor has designed the content to
help students become aware of some of the interesting and important aspects of
their immediate environment.  In terms of immediate impact on the environment,
severe local storms, major extratropical and tropical cyclones produce more
damage and loss of life than any other weather event.  The controls on these
physical processes can be understood at a conceptual level by the educated
layperson.



The science portion of the General Education program is also designed to
expose the student to the ways in which scientists do research.  The
definition of and testing of a hypothesis is fundamental to the advancement of
any discipline and is termed the "scientific method".  It is the instructor's
experience that students generally have a poor conception of what is involved
in application of the scientific method in the study of a problem.  The
present course is designed to help initiate the student to the scientific
method by presenting them with the results of a number of varied research
efforts into the understanding of destructive storms.  Hopefully, the students
will then be able to distinguish between the conclusions of valid

scientific research efforts and those of "fringe scientists" even though both
may be given equal weight in the media.



Segment III of General Education has an additional goal beyond those listed
above.  Courses in this segment should show that advancement in a particular
field has occurred because of interdisciplinary cooperation;  hence the
Segment III title **Relationships of Knowledge**.



 In the case of severe weather pheonmena, oceanographers and geologists can
contribute much to our understanding of the local controls on meteorological
events.  For example, sea-surface temperature and soil moisture patterns have
dramatic effects on a number of phenomena spanning many scales, from the
development of thunderstorm clusters to the path, number and strength of
winter storms.  Flooding and mudslides have as much to do the local geology
and geomorphology as they do to excessive rainfall.  While a detailed overview
of region-specific events is covered in other courses (e.g., Metr 356--
California Weather Events), the instructor will stress these general
interelationships when appropriate to illustrate the degree to which
"severity" of storms and other weather events is determined as much by human
patterns of settlement as it is to the strength of the weather event itself.



Finally, since no student has fulfilled the goals of a university education
unless he or she can communicate the learned information to others, one of the
requirements of Segment III is that students learn to pass on important
information in an effective manner, both verbally and in written form.  Since
this class is relatively small, this will be accomplished by both brief
written assignments and in brief oral reports.



**Logistics of the Course**



When one examines the weather-related "disasters" the last several years, a
number of events stand out clearly in terms of loss of life and damage to
property. Hurricane Andrew's path of destruction across southern Florida and
Louisiana in 1992 and the Oklahoma City tornadoes  of May 1999.  These events
were associated with weather phenonmena termed "severe storms" by most people.
Andrew was an example of a type of disturbance called a "tropical cyclone", in
which a special set of circumstances come together to produce an explosive
cluster of strong to severe thunderstorms, that eventually organized to become
a five hundered mile wide organized machine of destruction.  The tornadoes in
Oklahoma city occurred with a class of thunderstorm than in and of itself
seems to be designed by nature to maximize the destructive potential, the
"supercell."



Although these two damaging events stand out, actually both hurricanes and
supercells, in general, account for a disproportionate amount of the damage
and deaths related to weather phenomena, both in the United States in
particular, and the world in general.  Since my special background and area of
expertise is severe and unusual storms, the class will delve deeply into these
topics.   Lectures will be supplemented with my own slides and video tapes of
two of the types of storms which we will be discussing.  The personal tornado
videos were obtained on annual research trips to the Great Plains to study
severe thunderstorms.  This year's trip is May 21 through 8 June.



The point of view for this course will be to delve into the physical
mechanisms that produce these two types of explosive storms,  tropical
cyclones and  tornadic supercell thunderstorms.  Although some overview of
general meteorology will be provided, NO SPECIAL KNOWLEDGE IN EARTH SCIENCE OR
METEOROLOGY IS PRESUPPOSED.  There are no prerequisites for this course,
although the instructor presupposes that the students have had exposure to
high school geography, earth science, and mathematics.



The class will be of lecture format.  _Tests and assignments will be based
upon the lecture notes_ , supplemented by reading materials from the textbooks
and handouts.  **Although attendance will NOT be taken, students are
responsible for getting the lecture notes from a friend or another student.**

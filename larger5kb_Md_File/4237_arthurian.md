# _Arthurian Literature_

**

### DESCRIPTION:**

A survey of the origins and development of the Arthurian legend from the
earliest chronicles in the sixth century and later medieval French, Welsh,
Irish, and English Arthurian poems to modern adaptations of Arthurian
material, including films.  

### PURPOSE:

This course will investigate the major traditions associated with King Arthur
and his knights of the Round Table. We will witness the growth of the
Arthurian legend and investigate some of the reasons for its continuing

    II. Final Papers (approximately ten pages due at the end of the semester)
    
    The major written project in this course will be a paper on a modern treatment of the Arthurian legend which you will read in addition to the assigned reading material. In this paper you are asked to consider two points: the author's use of Arthurian sources and the work's artistic merit. In other words, you should consider how the writer makes use of the medieval materials related to Arthur and his knights and then determine whether or not the author has written an effective story or work of art. In writing this paper, also be sure to consider the following:
    
    1.  Does the writer reach a different conclusion or provide a 
    different outlook on the character(s)
    	 than does his or her medieval source?
    
    2.  How does the writer's source differ from the medieval sources?
     What does the author gain by altering his or her medieval source or including Arthurian materials in the story?
    
    3. Is the author's use of Arthurian materials appropriate to the point s/he or she wishes to make? Why?
    
    
    Choose one from the following list to write your paper on:
    
    Berger, Thomas. _Arthur Rex_.

    The long paper must be typewritten, doublespaced, with adequate margins, and submitted on the date due. Assignments will be graded on both form and content: strive for originality of thesis and cogency of argument, clear, coherent organization, and sufficient specificity and development. For additional help with writing pro_.
    
    Any student who wishes to do a creative project instead of the longer paper should see me well before the end of the course. In the past, exceptions have been allowed in my other courses for  students who
     have done various kinds of original projects, including a videotape
     of the first five ca of the Inferno, a poem from Virgil's point of view upon having to leave Dante at the end of the _Purgatorio_ ,
     a boardgame of _Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, a Second Cook's Tale_ (in Middle  English), and a cardgame based on _The Fellowship of the Ring_. Most students attempt to work into their projects  special avocational or professional interests.

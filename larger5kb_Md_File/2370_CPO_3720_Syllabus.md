**INTRODUCTION**  
  
With the end of the Cold War and the explosion of religious conflict in
various spots, the study of the relationships among religious groups is
increasingly important to disciplines within social sciences. One particular
set of relations has drawn the attention of political scientists and
historians as well: the complexity of coexistence of Jewish, Christian and
Muslim communities and governments. The Irish question, the surge of Islamist
movements worldwide, the fate of minorities under religious governments, Hindu
nationalism as well as the surge of Falung in China, are some of today's
important issues in comparative politics. These issues, and their impact on
Western policies, have paved the way to the emergence of a new area of study,
i.e., religions and world politics.  
  
Since September 11, 2001, and the subsequent geopolitical developments
worldwide, the link between militant religious ideologies and world
development became central. The tragic events in the United States and the
multiple declarations made by radical religious organizations are presently
reshaping a significant segment of international relations. The current
academic, intellectual and historic debate which accompanies this dramatic
evolution is impacting both the theoretical framework and practical equations
of World Politics.  
  
**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
The course will prepare students to understand the complexities of the
religious relationship between Christian, Muslim, Hindu, Jewish as well as
other communities and the impact of these relations on modern politics in
various areas of the world. The course will be useful to students of political
science, international relations, religion, philosophy, history, sociology and
humanities. The course will introduce various religious groups and ideologies.
Then, we will examine the emergence of religious civilizations, by using the
textbook of Samuel Huntington, The Clash of Civilizations. A third series of
inquiries will cover a variety of issues resulting from religious impact on
international politics such as: religious persecution worldwide, religious
minorities, religious-based conflicts, dialogue among religions, etc.  
  
**LEARNING METHODS**  
  
The course will primarily consist of class lecture and discussion. The
lectures will provide an analytical approach to the basic readings requested.
Discussions will focus on the various crisis and subjects of interests
selected in the assignments. In addition, the instructor has organized an in-
class lecture series with researchers in the field. Students will benefit from
an extended expertise and will be able to use that additional

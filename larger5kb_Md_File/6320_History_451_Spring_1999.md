---|---  
  
This course will begin with a brief review of how historians have interpreted
the American Revolution and a quick survey of the economy, politics, social
structure, and ideology of the colonies in the mid-eighteenth century so that
we will eventually be able to evaluate the impact of the Revolution on these
areas. We will then examine internal challenges to this status quo that
occurred before the Revolution, as well as the structure of the British
Empire. Next we will analyze the "imperial debates," or growing rift between
Great Britain and the colonies, that ultimately led to the Declaration of
Independence. We will then look at war on the battle front and on the home
front and at the Revolution's impact on African Americans and on women. We
will conclude with an assessment of the economic, social, political, and
ideological consequences of independence and of the "critical period," which
led to the adoption of the U.S. Constitution.

---|---  
  
CLASS PARTICIPATION:

This class will be run as a seminar and cannot be successful without your
active involvement. Therefore, your participation in class discussion is
required. You are to come to class prepared to talk about the week's readings.
Class participation will account for approximately 15% of your grade.

DISCUSSION LEADER:

Each student will be responsible for leading one class discussion. You should
prepare for this by reading the assigned readings thoroughly and critically.
Be able to make links among the readings. Do the authors take similar or
opposing points of view? What is their approach to history (social,
intellectual, political, cultural, economic, military)? What kinds of evidence
do the provide to sustain their theses? Are their arguments convincing and
why? Why did I assign them? What are the big questions that the readings
address? How does each reading contribute to answering these big questions?
When you are able to make such links among the readings, you will be able to
formulate questions to ask your colleagues in class, in order to get a good
discussion started. You are to provide me with a typed copy of the questions
you have prepared at the beginning of class. Your performance as a discussion
leader will account for approximately 10% of your grade.

READER-RESPONSE PAPERS:

Each week you are to turn in a typed reader-response paper on the assigned
readings at the beginning of class. These are short, informal papers giving
your reactions to the various readings. I will grade them on content, not on
style or grammar. Should you fall to turn in a paper on time or if the paper
fails to demonstrate that you have read the assignments, you will receive a
zero. These papers will account for approximately 20% of your grade.

RESEARCH PAPER:

You are to write one 8-10 page research paper, DUE APRIL 21, on a topic of
your choice, dealing with some aspect of the American Revolutionary era. You
must clear your paper topic with me by FEBRUARY 24. You must turn in your
paper's thesis statement and at least three supporting arguments that you will
use to uphold your thesis on APRIL 7. The paper assignment will be discussed
more fully in class. The paper will account for approximately 20% of your
grade.

EXAMINATIONS:

There will be one midterm examination and one final examination. The midterm
will be an inclass examination, consisting of an essay question and some short
identification questions. It will account for approximately 15% of your grade.
The final will be a take-home examination intended to make you synthesize the
course in some fashion. You will have at least a week to prepare it, and it is
DUE ON MAY 12, at 9:30 a.m. Slip it under my door if I am not in my office. It
will account for approximately 20% of your grade.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Students with disabilities are to provide their letters of certification and
accommodation within the first two weeks of class. The Disability Services
Office is part of Student Support Services, Main Hall 132. Phone: 262-3065.

PLEASE NOTE

To pass this course you must complete ALL assignments. I do not look kindly on
late papers, and, if I grade them at all, I will lower your grade accordingly.
Plagiarism on papers or examinations will be severely punished. At a minimum,
it will result in an F for the course. Incompletes (IFs) will not be given
unless I have granted prior approval or a genuine emergency exists. It is your
responsibility to contact me before finals week should you need to take an
incomplete and explain why one is necessary. I may or may not grant one.

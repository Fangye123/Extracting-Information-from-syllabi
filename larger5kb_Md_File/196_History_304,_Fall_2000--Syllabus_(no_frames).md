**_Brief description of course_**

The Renaissance was a time of unprecedented cultural creativity. It has also
been called the cradle of modern European politics, society, and culture. But
even scholars who agree that the Renaissance was important can disagree
vehemently about its nature, causes, and significance. In this course we will
attempt to define and explain the Renaissance; our main focus will be the
complex relationships between culture, society, and politics.

The course is organized in roughly chronological order, but its main focus
will be on themes and problems, not a continuous narrative. After discussing
the problem of the Renaissance as historians have approached it, and the
origins of the political and social world of the early Renaissance, we will
turn to society, the economy, and the material condition of life. We will then
turn to political forms and their transformations. Once we understand society
and politics, we can approach the two main forms of Renaissance culture,
humanism and the fine arts, as reflections and transformations of the social
and political realities of the Renaissance. We will then turn to culture in a
broader sense: gender roles, family values, religious and civic ritual. The
course ends with the dramatic shock of the High Renaissance and the fittingly
ambiguous political thought of Machiavelli.

Throughout the course we will be concerned not only with the fascinating
panorama of Renaissance life but also with the differences and continuities
between the Renaissance and the modern world. We will also develop models and
concepts for analyzing culture, society, and politics that can be applied to
many different situations, both historical and contemporary.

**Summary of requirements** : about 125 pages of reading each week (on
average), one 4-5 page paper, one 8-10 page paper, one take-home midterm, one
take-home final.

**_Course goals_**

This course has several different goals. By the end of the semester, you
should be able to:

  * Define "the Renaissance" adequately and defend your definition.
  * Explain the differences between politics, culture, and society, and discuss how they are related.
  * Describe the main characteristics and values of Renaissance humanism.
  * Describe the main characteristics and techniques of Renaissance art.
  * Explain how cultural ideals and social roles differed for men and women.
  * Describe Machiavelli's political thought and explain how it is related to humanist ideals and Italian political history.
  * Analyze and criticize the argument of a secondary source.
  * Interpret primary sources from the Renaissance and use them as evidence for historical arguments.

_**Your goals for the course**_

You have just read my goals for the course. You should now take the time to
reflect on those goals and think about any others you might have. You will
probably learn more from the course if you approach it with goals in mind.

**_Course structure_**

History 304 is a combined lecture-discussion course. Some days there will be
more lecture, others there will be more discussion. **The readings are
assigned _weekly_ , and you should plan to complete them by the Tuesday of
each week**. That way we can adjust the amount of time we devote to each topic
as we see fit without having to make last-minute changes to the syllabus. If
you absolutely can't finish all the reading for a week by Tuesday, read what
you can in the order it is printed in the syllabus, and catch up by Thursday.

**_Requirements and grading_**

This course is an upper-division history course. History, as a scholarly
discipline, requires a lot of reading, careful attention to detail, and
grasping difficult concepts. You should be prepared to spend three to five
hours per week outside of class on the reading, and a little more time when
there are assignments due.

**1\. Attendance and participation**  
You will not get much out of the course if you don't attend class to hear
lectures and participate in discussion. Much of what you need to know to
understand the Renaissance will be introduced in class, and you will be
expected to display knowledge of it in papers and exams. Athletes, musicians,
and others who will have to miss class for University purposes should give me
a list as soon as possible, but in any case by **September 28** at the latest.

You will not receive a separate grade for attendance and participation (but
see requirement 2). Good attendance and participation will be reflected in the
papers and exams.

**2\. In-class quickwrites**  
From time to time you will write 5-10 minute response papers in class. These
assignments will help prepare you for discussion and help me find out where I
need to be more clear. They will not be graded but they are **required**. If
you miss more than 3 of them, your final course grade will be lowered by one-
half letter grade for each missing quickwrite.

**3\. One 4-5 page paper (20% of final grade)**  
Due **Tuesday, October 10** , at 5:00 PM in my office, Herter 624. Topics for
the paper will be distributed by September 19 (three weeks in advance). You
may rewrite the paper if you are dissatisfied with the grade.

**4\. Take-home midterm exam (20% of final grade)**  
Distributed at the end of class on **Thursday, October 26**. It will be due on
**Tuesday, October 31** , at 5:00 PM in my office, Herter 624. There is no
reading for the week of Oct. 31. Students whose grade is lower than B on the
midterm may review the course material and take an oral examination to improve
their grade (to a maximum of B).

**5\. One 8-10 page paper (30% of final grade)**  
Due **Tuesday, December 12** at 5:00 PM in my office, Herter 624. Topics for
the paper will be distributed by November 14 (four weeks in advance).

**6\. Take-home final exam (30% of final grade)**  
Distributed at the end of the last day of class, **Thursday, December 14**. It
will be due on **Thursday, December 21** , at **noon** in my office, Herter
624.

**Option: term paper**  
Students interested in writing a 20-25 page term paper may do so instead of
completing requirements 5 and 6; the paper will count for 60% of the final
course grade. If you are considering this option, you must talk to me by the
end of September to discuss a topic and additional reading, though you can
change your mind later. This is a good option for those who want to explore a
specific topic in more depth. The term paper will be due at the same time the
take-home final is due.

**_Policy on late assignments_**

Late assignments will have the maximum grade reduced by one-half letter grade
for each working day they are late (weekends and holidays do not count).
Exceptions will be made only when an extension is granted at least two days in
advance of the due date, or in the case of a bona fide emergency
(documentation from a medical professional or the dean of students may be
required).

**_Policy on academic honesty_**

Plagiarism is grounds for failure in the course. Plagiarism consists of either
(a) copying the exact words of another work without both enclosing them in
quotation marks and providing a reference, or (b) using information or ideas
from another work without providing credit, in notes, to the source of the
information or ideas. Submission of a paper copied from another work, or which
contains fictitious or falsified notes, will result in automatic failure of
the course. Please refer to the [Undergraduate Rights and
Responsibilities](http://www-saris.admin.umass.edu/rights/) booklet for the
University's full policy on academic honesty.

**_Books for course_**

The following **required** books have been ordered through Food For Thought
Books (106 N. Pleasant Street, Amherst, tel. 253-5432). They are also on
reserve in the DuBois Library. I have given ISBN numbers in case you want to
order them yourself; I encourage you to support local businesses. Note:
Bookstores begin to return unsold books around the beginning of November, so
be sure to buy them while they're still available.

**_A note on readings_**

Because this course involves frequent discussions, you should bring your books
or a good set of reading notes to class.

The _Thames & Hudson Dictionary of the Italian Renaissance_ is required, but
readings are not specifically listed. Use it to familiarize yourself with
unfamiliar names and terms that you encounter in readings and lectures.

The course web page has an enhanced syllabus with an extensive set of
suggested readings, in case you are interested in pursuing any topic in more
depth.

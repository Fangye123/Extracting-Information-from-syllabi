Fifty years ago the British historian Herbert Butterfield started a stir by
arguing that the emergence of modern science between 1450 and 1700 'outshines
everything since the rise of Christianity and reduces the Renaissance and
Reformation to the rank of mere episodes, mere internal displacements, within
the system of medieval Christendom.'

Now, by tradition, the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century marks
a watershed in Western Civilization and Modern Thought {more recently, the
birth mark of imperial dominance} that challenged Christian revelations,
altered the world view of philosophers, permeated university curricula,
established new literary genres, and suggested new approaches for economic,
political, and social theorists. Until recently the Scientific Revolution, as
a periodization, was the acknowledged father and foundation--the very essence
--of Enlightenment.

Traditionally associated with an elite litany--beginning with Canon Copernicus
and resonating through Kepler, Galileo, Descartes, and Newton--the Scientific
Revolution is here honored as each major figure is addressed in
historiographic context. But there was more to the story, more players than
traditionally appear in survey texts. Clearly the status of each of the major
Heros--like the periodization itself--has shifted historiographically across
chronological, geographic, thematic, and methodological boundaries. In this
Colloquium we focus on the changes that have displaced the traditional heroes.
Here we give equal weight to lesser figures and to broader intellectual,
cultural, social, and institutional circumstances.

We have two objectives. First, to identify critical issues (involving specific
writings, activities, and practices) in the context of early modern life as
identified in primary readings and research. Second, and perhaps equally
challenging, we examine the assumptions and interpretations surrounding the
treatment of these issues by recent historians. Our goal is to situate a
clearly defined textual problem in broader (and sometimes conflicting)
interpretive contexts.  We want to understand why there are opposing
interpretations offered by various historical schools and traditions. The
ideal problem for your last Essay is a clearly identified and widely
acknowledged problem that has evoked the most varied interpretations. The
question is how and why historians often interpret the 'same thing' so
differently.  We pursue this issue throughout the seminar.

To that end, Colloquium participants will write and defend a critical research
essay. This essay will focus on clearly defined issues {e.g., the world;
observation; interpretation; practice} identified in primary sources through
individual research. The objective of the essay is to test the relation
between these issues and at least two relevant, possibly conflicting,
historiographic schools or genres. Full particulars of the essay--notably the
relation between specific 'scientific' texts and more general historiographic
interpretations--will be provided and discussed in class.

In addition to the critical essay, participants are expected to take an active
part in Colloquium discussions and to present their preliminary research to a
critical audience. Each of these requirements is built into the Seminar
schedule. Please note that attendance is expected, participation mandatory. If
students are interested in additional optional work, notably special projects
related to the Scientific Revolution, please discuss your interest with the
instructor early in the semester. **Office hours** for Professor Hatch are
Tuesday 3.00-6.00pm and by appointment, 4123 Turlington Hall. Students are
urged to take advantage of **Office Hours** for consultation and discussion.

Finally, please note there are major sections of my WebSite devoted to this
course.  Students are required to visit appropriate sections devoted to the
Scientific Revolution as well as sections dealing with Reading, Writing, and
other issues (for example, Taking Notes on Readings and from Lectures).  These
sections supply teaching and research resources (bibliography, secondary
readings, WebLinks, and SearchLinks). Importantly, the WebSite is accessible
24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The WebSite is located at:
<http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch> .  Suggestions for the WebSite are
welcome.

American Military History, 1607-1914





Courage, ideology or both? This statue commemorates the charge of 
    the First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment at Gettysburg on the second 
    day of the battle. Ordered to plug a breach in the Union line, the regiment 
    began the charge with 262 men. It contained the Confederate advance and 
    helped save the Union position on Cemetery Ridge, but at a cost of 215 
    killed and wounded: a percentage loss of 82 percent. This is generally 
    considered to be the highest percentage of casualties suffered by any Union 
    regiment in a single battle during the entire Civil War.

    Lecture Notes for Rest of Course

Thanks to our foray into the world of the Peace Camp, 
    we're about four lectures behind schedule.  So that we can concentrate 
    on the course's most important themes and avoid a forced march through the 
    remaining three weeks, I have placed an old (but serviceable) set of lecture 
    notes on the web.  These should supplement the material in For the 
    Common Defense.  Needless to say, they are not a replacement for 
    coming to class.
The link above will take you to an old syllabus, which in 
    turn has links to the lectures themselves.

Overview and Objectives
This course describes and analyzes the history of American military 
    policy from the colonial period to the eve of the First World War. It 
    focuses on the creation of American military institutions, the genesis of 
    policy-making and maintenance of civilian control over that process, the 
    interrelationship between foreign and military policy, the conduct of war, 
    and the influence of American society upon the armed forces as social 
    institutions.
Students will achieve an understanding of the main developments in 
    American military history, the ways in which these developments reflected or 
    shaped developments in general American history, and the main 
    interpretations advanced by scholars who have studied this subject. They 
    will also hone their skills at critical writing and analysis, and will gain 
    greater insight into the way historians explore the human condition.

How To Survive History 582.01
    A Guide for Undergraduates

Introduction
History 668.01 describes and analyzes the history of American military 
    policy from the colonial period to the eve of the First World War. It 
    focuses on the creation of American military institutions, the genesis of 
    policy-making and maintenance of civilian control over that process, the 
    inter-relationship between foreign and military policy, the conduct of war, 
    and the influence of American society upon the armed forces as social 
    institutions. It is an upper division course intended to be taught at the 
    graduate student level. It is also an elective; I therefore assume that 
    students have chosen to take it because they are interested and motivated to 
    learn the material.
The course requires about 100 pages of reading per week--sometimes more, 
    seldom less. If you accept this reality at the outset you will be all right. 
    If you assume you can pick up everything from lecture or from a light 
    skimming of the main text you will not do well. It's as simple as that. But 
    don't assume that you can blow off the lectures, either. For one thing, 
    paying attention to the lectures will help keep you on track, so that you 
    don't overemphasize some issues while ignoring others. For another, good 
    attendance helps generate a certain goodwill between instructor and student, 
    because it more or less demonstrates that the student is trying. That 
    goodwill can come in handy if you fall down on the mid-term and need a 
    little extra help. Finally, there is almost always a strong positive 
    correlation between good attendance and good course performance. So while 
    lecture attendance is not required, it is strongly encouraged.
Office Hours
Similarly, I encourage you to take full advantage of my office hours and 
    those of the teaching associate. As a practical matter, you may want to 
    visit him in preference to myself, since he will be grading your 
    examinations.
Examinations
The mid-terms and final are divided into two main parts: 
    "identifications" and essays.
1. Identifications
Identification questions call upon the student to identify and give the 
    significance of a given term. The identification portion of the answer 
    should define the term and/or discuss its important features. The 
    significance portion should link the term to one or more of the larger 
    conceptual issues raised in the course. Example:
Alfred Thayer Mahan - professor at the U.S. Naval War College, 
    prophet of seapower and author (among many other works) of The Influence of 
    Seapower Upon History. Mahan's work laid stress on command of the seas as a 
    key to national power and emphasized the creation of strong battle fleets as 
    the means by which this might be achieved. Denigrated commerce-raiding and 
    stressed the destruction of the enemy's main battle fleet as the most 
    appropriate objective. Significance: Mahan was the foremost proponent of the 
    ideas that underlay the creation of steam-powered, big gun steel navy in the 
    late 19th and early 20th centuries, and a major example of the new military 
    professionalization that occurred during this period.
Notice that this ID was answered in just four sentences. Try to be as 
    succinct when you write your own. Too often students will include a great 
    deal of extraneous information in their ID responses that improves their 
    grade not a whit. Just as often they will fail to address the ID's 
    significance; i.e., to place it in a larger context. Avoid making either 
    mistake.
2. Essay
The identification portion of the test is concerned primarily with the 
    student's understanding of the facts. By contrast, the essay is more 
    concerned with the student's grasp of the overarching concepts and how these 
    concepts organize and give meaning to the facts themselves. Students 
    frequently assume that the essay is just another way for them to demonstrate 
    what they know about the material that has been presented in class. This 
    leads them to do a "memory dump," which can have unpleasant consequences and 
    usually does, because an essay is intended to test your ability to think 
    analytically and to explain your analysis on paper. This involves, in turn:
a. an ability to write clearly, so that the reader is not baffled by 
    misspellings, grammatical faults, run-on sentences, etc.;
b. an ability to articulate a thesis; in other words, to orient the 
    reader to the question that will be answered and to explain why the question 
    is important;
c. an ability to prioritize. What issues are most important in answering 
    the question? What is the most logical order in which to present them? What 
    examples most clearly illustrate these critical issues?
d. an ability to avoid the irrelevant: everything you write should relate 
    directly and explicitly to the question posed;
e. an ability to write an essay that is proportional to the time allowed 
    for its completion. If you have 20 minutes to complete an essay, you must 
    tailor your depth of coverage so that you cover the whole question in 20 
    minutes, without omitting important points or overemphasizing one point to 
    the detriment of another.
Note: The exams will test you on the three additional books assigned in 
    the course. For the midterm, you'll be tested on Fred Anderson's A 
    People's Army; for the final, James M. McPherson's For Cause and 
    Comrades and Theodore Roosevelt's The Rough Riders.
Book Reviews
1. Selection of Books
You must choose two books from the bibliography in the back of 
    this packet, but you cannot choose books that are already part of the 
    reading for the course. The books should be related in some 
    way--chronologically, thematically, etc.--and you should examine the books 
    in a comparative fashion.
2. Content
I expect your book reviews to conform more closely to those found in 
    scholarly journals than to those in newspapers and general interest 
    magazines. In newspapers and magazines, the main point of the 
    review--besides telling what the book is about--is often to give the reader 
    a sense of the work's style and dramatic qualities. Academic reviews, on the 
    other hand, have a somewhat different agenda. Their purpose is fourfold: (1) 
    to explain briefly what the book is about, (2) to analyze its thesis, (3) to 
    offer a critical assessment of the book's strengths and weaknesses, and (4) 
    to appraise its historical value. While this is not intended as a rigid 
    formula, each of these points should be addressed in the course of your 
    review.
1. What the Books Are About - Offer the reader a brief overview of the 
    books' subject matter, but try to encapsulize each work within three or four 
    paragraphs. Identify the major events and personalities examined, key 
    concepts employed, etc., but do not summarize the books in detail.
2. Thesis - What are the authors' main arguments? What are they trying to 
    demonstrate or refute? Do they reach similar or divergent conclusions?
3. Strengths and Weaknesses - What do you think of the authors' theses? 
    Do they do a good job of proving it? What sources did they use--personal 
    experience, unpublished government documents, private manuscript 
    collections, published primary or secondary works? If the books deal 
    extensively with non-English-speaking nations, did they consult sources 
    written in the appropriate foreign languages? Do you think they addressed 
    all the relevant issues or can you think of some that they ought to have 
    examined but did not? What were the authors' qualifications for writing such 
    books? Did they have a particular ax to grind? Is their writing style clear 
    or is their prose convoluted and difficult to follow?
4. Historical Importance - How useful would an interested historian find 
    the books to be? What makes you think so? Most especially, place the books 
    within the context of one or more of the main themes and concepts discussed 
    in the course.
These questions and issues are intended as examples of what your paper 
    should cover. They are not a checklist. Some may be more relevant to the 
    books you select than others while you may come up with other questions not 
    mentioned here.
3. Format
Your review should be typed, double-spaced, and about eight pages in 
    length. It should be written clearly and free of grammatical errors and 
    misspellings. I AM NOT KIDDING.
On a separate cover sheet, give the review some sort of title and below 
    it, place your name, the course number, and the date. The book's 
    bibliographical data should appear at the top of the review: author, title, 
    place of publication, publisher, date of publication, number of pages. For 
    example:
Christopher Duffy, The Military Experience in the Age of Reason. 
    New York: Atheneum, 1988. Pp. xi, 446.
In instances where you quote directly from the works under review, a 
    parenthetical citation [e.g., (Duffy, 242)] is appropriate. If other works 
    are quoted, give the full citation in a footnote [e.g., Christopher Duffy,
    The Military Experience in the Age of Reason (New York: Atheneum, 
    1988), 242.] When in doubt, consult an appropriate reference work. One of 
    the best is Kate L. Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, 
    Theses, and Dissertations (5th ed., Chicago and London: University of 
    Chicago Press, 1987). It sells for about $7.95 in paperback and is readily 
    available.
In the past, I have received a number of book reviews that do not meet 
    the above criteria, with dire consequences for the student.
Possible Book Review Pairings
The list below offers just some of the many possibilities for comparative 
    book reviews. For other books, see the extensive bibliographies at the end 
    of Chapters 1-9 of For the Common Defense. You are not limited to 
    these possibilities. However, the two books you suggest must offer equally 
    good opportunities for comparison, and you must clear the books with me 
    beforehand.

**Course Description and Organization**

HIST 319L tackles three problems of historical interpretation: 1) how do
motion pictures represent the past; 2) how do historians and popular audiences
understand historical film differently; and 3) how can the history of Latin
America be understood through cinema. In addressing these problems, we will
look at scholarly and popular readings of a number of motion pictures that
purport to say something about Latin American history.

The course meets twice weekly for three-hour and fifteen-minute sessions. A
different film will be screened each session, to be followed by a general
discussion.

HIST 319L satisfies CORE requirements for Diversity (D).

**Course Requirements**

Throughout the course, all students should keep a **_Journal_** that engages
the main themes and problems raised in the films and readings assigned for
class. Major themes include: the question of historical (in)accuracy,
historical feel, scholarly vs. popular vs. commercial understandings of the
past, and the relationship between contemporary events and historical film.
Students are encouraged to use their journal to make connections between the
assigned readings and films seen outside of class. The Journal must be turned
in at the end of second, fourth, and sixth week of class.

The **_Writing Assignment_** is due Wednesday, July 5. The 5-7 page paper will
analyze one film as a historical text. See below for the list of possible
choices.

The [Final Examination](final.html). The open-note exam will be distributed at
our last meeting, Wednesday, July 14, and be due by 4:30pm, Friday, July 14,
2000.

All students are actively encouraged to seek out Professor Williams for
guidance in writing well-organized and engaging papers. Outlines and/or rough
drafts are welcomed.

**Grading Policies**

Final grades will be determined by the following formula:

30% Journal  
25% Writing Assignment  
25% Final Examination  
20% Participation

Active participation and lively discussions enrich everyone's learning
experience. It is important that all students use our in-class discussions to
engage the assigned materials and one another. Active participation will work
in your favor should your final grade fall on a borderline. The reverse is
equally true.

Late papers will not be accepted without prior approval. With the exception of
legitimate excuses, late papers may be subject to a grade penalty of one full
grade for each day late.

All University regulations concerning academic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. Violation of these codes may result in a failing grade and/or
referral to a University disciplinary committee. Should you have _ANY_
questions or doubts about citation and attribution, please see the your
teaching assistant and/or the professor.

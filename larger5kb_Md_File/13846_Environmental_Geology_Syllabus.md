### Earth Science Syllabus

Objective - The primary focus of this course is to:

  * Introduce the student to the dynamics of how planet earth works,
  * explore the major processes that shape the surface of the Earth,
  * investigate the interactions between the land, the sea and the atmosphere and finally,
  * to define the relationship between our planet and the rest of the heavens. 

Topics covered will include:

  * Introduction and the Scientific Method - you will have the opportunity to understand and apply the general nature of scientific thinking and how scientific knowledge is accumulated and tested to form theories.
  * Minerals and Rocks - we will explore the mineral world, their unique properties and look at some of the rock types that they often produce. We will also look at the different ways that rocks are created (from volcanoes, floods, mountain building processes and such) and distributed around the world, outline the rock cycle and discuss what these rocks tell us about the geologic history of areas.
  * Plate Tectonics and the Earth's Interior - we will walk through the development of the most important set of ideas that explain how planet Earth works and see the relevance of these ideas to processes and events that we witness on the surface of the Earth today. We will determine how these ideas pertain to earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountain building processes.
  * Surface Processes - we will also investigate processes (sometimes hazardous) that affect everyday life on Earth including landslides, streams and flooding, groundwater, glaciers, and wind and deserts.
  * Geologic Time - discussions will delve into the concepts of geologic time and what the geologic record tells us about the formation of the Earth and the origin of life.
  * The Ocean Environment - will focus on the physical dynamics of the ocean basins themselves, the mechanisms that induce changes into this environment and the mechanics behind surface and subsurface wave action..
  * The Atmosphere - the general nature of atmospheric conditions, the influence of solar energy on weather conditions, the nature and movement of water in the atmosphere, air pressure differences and winds, storms and weather trends, how all of these conditions define climatic conditions, and the influence of man on climatic conditions.
  * Astronomy - this venture will take us to the origins of the science of Astronomy, man's understanding of how our planet moves through the heavens and how this understanding has evolved through time. We will learn about the other planets in our solar system, what makes them similar and different to the Earth, and explore some of the tools astronomers use to explore the heavens. We will finish by looking outside of our solar system and explore the birth of the universe.

**Grades \- ** Your course grade will be determined by your performance on
three (3) exams (30% each) and three response papers (10%). There will be no
extra credit. Missed exercises without prior arrangement will be given a grade
of zero. Any form of academic misconduct will result in a grade of zero for
that exercise and will be reported to the Geology Department and the Dean of
Academic Affairs.  
  
**Exams** \- The exams will primarily consist of short answer questions and
will cover all material covered in class (response papers, readings, videos,
slides, lectures, quizzes, etc.) and assigned readings. If you must miss an
exam please make prior arrangements with me or, if ill, call and let me know
the problem. There will be no make-up exams without an excused absence. I am
most serious about this policy, you should be too. Probable exam dates:
Tuesday - January 8th, Tuesday - January 15th and Tuesday - January

[**Homework**](http://www.csus.edu/indiv/c/cornwell/earth/homework.htm) \-
Assignments will be given throughout the semester that integrates lecture
material with outside assignments. The homework should be chronologically
organized in a folder or portfolio. I will collect homework portfolios a
couple of times during the semester to check them for completeness. You are
expected to do ALL of the homework assignments, even if you miss a class or do
not complete the homework on time. Your portfolios can include additional
materials that show your interest in and mastery of Earth Science.

utilizing the linked web readings.

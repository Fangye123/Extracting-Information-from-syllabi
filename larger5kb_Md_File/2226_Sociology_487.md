**COURSE OBJECTIVE**  
The objective of this course is to investigate the role and relationships
between racial minorities, i.e., African- Americans, Native Americans,
Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, at each level of the criminal justice
system in the United States. Greater emphasis will be devoted to the
experience of African-Americans in this regard, since this sub-group has been
the subject of more extensive research in the field of criminology/criminal
justice. Although women and youth are also special minority groups which have
been discriminated against, they will not be included in the course in any
depth. These groups are covered extensively in Women in Crime and Juvenile
Delinquency courses offered by the Sociology Department.  
This course will provide a flexible forum for the discussion of racial
minorities, crime, and social policy by examining and evaluating criminal
statistics and race, trends and issues in measuring racial involvement in
crime; race and theories of crime; race and American law; racial minorities
and law enforcement; race relations and the police; race and the criminal
courts; capital punishment and race; race and correction systems; race and
parole; and institutional racism in the criminal justice system.  
In addition to the comprehensive examination of race and crime, attention will
be devoted to an analysis of the history and life experiences of each of these
minority groups in the United States in order to illustrate the
interrelationship of the criminal justice system and racial discrimination
that has led to institutionalized racism in the criminal justice system.  
Finally, the course will address alternatives to the present dual standard of
justice and the formulation of a social policy that could lead to a more
equitable justice system and a reduction in crime.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING POLICY**  
There will be two (2) written objective examinations, each weighted at 30
percent of the final grade. Each examination will consist of multiple choice
and essay questions. There will be no excused absences except for documented
medical or extenuating circumstances. Any permitted make-up may vary in style
and content from the original exam. The two examinations equal 60 percent of
the final grade.  
Additionally, each student is required to participate in a debate on one of
the following topics: theory, law enforcement, law/courts, capital punishment,
corrections, social policy (See Course Outline for specific debate questions).

> _Debate structure:_  
>  Chair/Discussant 10 minutes summary and analysis  
>  Pro (1-2 students) 5 minutes each for statement/3 minutes each for rebuttal  
>  Con (1-2 students) 5 minutes each for statement/3 minutes each for rebuttal

_Debate assignments:_  
Each debater will prepare a five (5) page statement of his/her position and a
two (2) page rebuttal statement. These papers must be typed double spaced on 8
x 11 paper (letter size). No later than one week prior to the debate, copies
of the debate statement must be given to the debate opponent and the
chair/discussant. The statment and rebuttal are handed in for grading on the
debate day. Each chair/discussant will prepare a 8-10 page, double-spaced,
typed paper summarizing both debate positions, augmented by readings, and
present this analysis at the end of the debate. This is due on the debate day.  
The debate statement cannot be late since the success of the debate depends on
receit of papers. The penalty for unexcused late late papers is 5% of the
Debate statement weight.

**Grading** will be objective, thus resulting in a percentage score: A =
100-90; B = 89-80; C = 79-70; D = 69-60; E = Below 60. **THERE IS NO CURVE**.  
**Weighting** Debate statement 20%; Debate presentation 10%; Debate rebuttal
statement 10%; Written examinations 60% (or 30% each)

**ATTENDANCE POLICY**  
Class attendance is _strictly required_ on debate dates. Absenteeism on each
such day will be penalized by one percent (1%) of the course grade. Seven (7)
absences will result in a failing grade (E) for the course.

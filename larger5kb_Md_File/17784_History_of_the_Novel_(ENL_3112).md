**Development of the Novel**  
  
The novel has become the most-read genre in English literature, a popularity
that has endured from the eighteenth century. Because novels are so highly
regarded, many have sought to find the precise moment of their birth. One of
the most commonplace assertions in English literary studies is that the novel
began in the eighteenth century, andthen steadily  "rose" in respectability
and  
technical mastery. During this semester, we will want to examine

  * why the novel as a genre was at first considered scandalous, and then became acceptable even admired; 
  * how the many and varied forms of prose fiction came to be classified as the novel; 
  * why we like to create a narrative of the birth and growth of the novel that itself seems invested in the story-telling techniques of the genre; 
  * how the novel participates in as well as reveals the culture it purports to record. 
  
To answer these questions and to achieve our lofty goals, we will read six
novels and a companion to the genre; participate in group presentations; write
two papers; talk, talk, talk, and talk s'more; and, in the end, take a final
examination that will demonstrate to your professor that you've thought about
the issues listed above and formed some of your own ideas about them.  
**  
Your responsibilities:**

  * **Individual:** reading, writing, discussing. Please arrive to class on time. Make sure you read and understand all handouts and announcements. If you miss a handout (because you missed a class), arrange to photocopy it from someone in your group. 
  * **Group:** Each small study group will have 3 to 5 students (depending on the final number of students enrolled). You must be a team-player and contribute to all in class written assignments and discussions. With those group tasks, you will turn in a report of your findings and discussions. 
  * **Class:** Contribute to discussions, listen to others' points of view, make relevant points, ask substantive questions, don't monopolize discussion. 
  * **Student to Professor:** Discuss literary works, paper topics, share successes, alert to problems. 
  
**Brief Description of written assignments and additional activities:**

  * **In-class writing.** For each novel, you will have a passage from the readings to respond to by writing a very short essay. Responding in writing to these passages will help you practice for the final examination and gain expertise with timed writing. These will be graded and contribute toward your participation grade. [We will discuss strategies for successful responses well before the first in-class response](icsample.html). These responses and your classroom participation figure as 30% of your grade. 
  * **Contexts presentation and essay**. In a dynamic and creative class presentation with the other members of your group, you will present what you've learned from a selected topic as it relates to the novel you're working on. Each group will be assigned to one novel and will be comprised of members who will be the  "resident student expert" on an assigned area of expertise. Your job as a group will be to help the class understand the novel in a fuller context. You will turn in a short paper (4-5 pages) that discusses the novel and the area of expertise you've worked on. This paper and class discussion are together worth 20%. [Presentations and Papers](present.html)
  * **Formal Essay.** 7-10 pages (1700 to 2000 words). You may use the research you did for the first paper, but this second paper must focus on a different novel read for this class. Your paper must conform to MLA guidelines. 20% [Assignment and assessment guidelines will be posted to the web site](fpaper.html). 
  * **Final Exam.** Several passages in the same mode as in-class writing tasks; short answer; essay. In-class; 2 hours. 30% 
  
**  
Miscellaneous Rules of the Road:**

  * I have a few quirks I'd like to share with you. I find it really disruptive when people stroll in late; I'm irked by people who disappear without a word for weeks on end and then show up outta nowhere. I'm generally easygoing, accommodating, and generous when legitimate problems come up for students. So, if you could just email me or call me to tell me what's up, I'd appreciate it. Also, I understand that many of you work. I put myself through an undergraduate education, so I know how hard it is to balance work and school (and many of you also balance partners and a family). My point is, you must learn to balance your many responsibilities. Find a balance you can live with, but also accept the responsibility of that choice. 
  * If you find that your health, work or family responsibilities mean that you will have to miss classes, you should make your health, family, and work your first priority and drop this class. 
  * If you lack any one of the formal written assignments, you cannot pass this course; if you miss more than seven hours of class time, you also cannot pass this course. 
  
Please turn off all cell phones, beepers, and watch alarms before coming to
class.

### Attendance Policy:

Students will find it difficult to succeed in the course unless they attend
regularly. However, your instructor does not believe in artificially
penalizing students by lowering grades for failure to attend classes. I do,
however, have a closed mind on absences from tests and late research papers.
Make-up tests will be given only when students can show a valid reason for the
absence.

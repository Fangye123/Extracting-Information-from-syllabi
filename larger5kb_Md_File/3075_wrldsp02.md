## Course Description and Goals

This course provides a general introduction to the history of the world over
the last 500 years, from approximately 1450 to the present. This period is
characterized by the rise of Europe and the gradual integration of the world
into an European/Western dominated global system. The course will be broken
down into three sections, the period from 1450-1750, the 19th century, and the
20th century. In each section, we will study seven different areas of the
world: Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, China, Japan, Africa, and
Latin America. Instead of trying to master the political history of each area,
we will concentrate on specific themes in each section, using the themes to
make comparisons between the different areas. A significant portion of each
class will be devoted to a discussion of primary source material and relevant
historical and/or contemporary issues.

In the first section of the course, we will try to gain an understanding of
different societies in the world from about 1450 to 1800. We will try to gain
an understanding of how peoples in different parts of the world governed
themselves and organized their economies in this period. We will analyze which
social groups made up these societies, and how people gained access to the
ruling elite. In other words, we will be comparing the political, economic and
social structures of these different areas of the world from around the 16th
to 18th centuries.

In the next section of the course, we will focus on the process of European
encroachment, examining how European nations gradually gained political or
economic control over most of the globe by the end of the 19th century. In
this section, we will compare and contrast the different ways European nations
gained control over other parts of the world--colonization, indirect control,
economic dependency, etc. We will examine how different areas attempted to
resist European encroachment and how they were transformed--and transformed
themselves--in response to European imperialism.

In the last section of the course, we will focus on the 20th century,
examining the process of decolonization and the strategies different
nationalist movements used to achieve independence. We will focus on the
development of the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union and
compare communism in the Soviet Union, China, and Latin America.

This course aims to increase students' knowledge of world affairs, and
stimulate students' interest in international developments, cultures, and
news. By the end of the course, students should have a deeper awareness and
understanding of the world in which we live: its history, state structures,
problems, and conflicts.

Grades:**

Your grade for this class will be based on:

**

  1. Class Participation** **and in-class writing assignments: 10%**  
Classes will be held twice per week; attendance at all classes is
**_mandatory**_. Students who miss more than two classes will not receive a
grade higher than "C" for class participation. Students who are late disrupt
the class, so three "tardies" will be counted as an absence. Learning must be
an active process, and regular attendance, preparation, and participation is
_essential_ to your success in this course. Students must come to each class
prepared to discuss the documents and issues listed in the syllabus so that we
can engage in successful class and small group discussions. The class will
engage in in-class writing assignments based on the reading on a random basis.

**

  2. Midterm Examinations: 40% (20% each)**  
There will be midterm examinations (short answer and essay) at the end of the
first two sections: February 25 and April 8. _Mark the date on your calendar
now_ ; there will be no make-ups for students who don't show up for the exams.

**

  3. Short papers based on the documents: 30% (15% each)**  
Each student must submit two short (2 pages) typewritten essays in response to
the "documents" questions listed below. **_Please pass in two copies_ :** one
copy will be returned. The essays must be based on the student's analysis of
the assigned documents, with explicit references (with parenthetical
citations) to the documents. This is a writing exercise, so essays must be
tightly constructed, well written, and PROOF READ! **All students will be
required to sign a pledge stating that they understand what plagiarism is and
that they will not plagiarize any part of their papers. _Students who attempt
to plagiarize any part of their papers will receive an "F" for the class and
be reported to the Dean and the Provost.**_ The essays may be submitted at any
point during the semester, but essays drawn from a particular time period must
be submitted within a week after we finish with that period. Each essay must
deal with a different time period **and** different areas of the world, so all
students must submit at least one paper by April 5. The last day to submit the
second paper is May 6, the last day of class.

**

  4. Final Examination: 20%**  
The exam will consist of short answer and essay questions.

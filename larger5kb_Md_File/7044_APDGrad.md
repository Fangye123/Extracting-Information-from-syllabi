**American Political Development**

  

_Course Description_  


The study of American political development offers scholars a vehicle for
exploring many dimensions of politics, state formation, and political life in
the United States. Accordingly, proponents of various analytical approaches
have turned to historical research over the past two decades. From a formal
theory perspective, history offers a rich source of cases that may be used to
test various propositions. Scholars who pursue the rational choice version of
new institutionalism have drawn upon historical evidence to develop a number
of significant concepts, including structure-induced equilibrium and
endogeneity. Practitioners of other approaches likewise have turned to the
past to better explain how the political system operates today. The
descriptive-narrative new institutionalists offer single-case longitudinal and
comparative studies to demonstrate the impact of past decisions on later
institutional, political, and policy development. This research has yielded
concepts like path dependence that have become a standard component in
accounts of institutional development. At the same time, scholars of American
political ideas and culture have traced the impact of debates, narratives, and
rhetoric on politics. American political development, in short, has become the
terrain upon which the different major approaches to the study of American
politics (and political phenomena more generally) engage each other and break
down many of the standard categories within the American politics field. The
results range from positive cross-fertilization to sharp and sometimes angry
debate.  


In this seminar we will examine a number of approaches to the study of
American political development. Note that unlike a history course, this one is
not organized chronologically. Rather, each session will be devoted to the
discussion of a different analytical approach. It is to be expected that there
will be some overlap in historical coverage; indeed, that overlap is
desirable, because it will help us understand how different approaches draw
upon different kinds of evidence and illuminate different aspects of the same
phenomenon. I have selected readings that I regard as "productive": that is,
they have either generated significant discussion or have given rise to
further research that employs the same analytical tools. Students will be
encouraged to consider how the material we cover in the course might be used
as a springboard for their own research, up to and including doctoral
dissertations, in American politics and other fields.  


_Course Requirements_  


1\. Complete assigned readings before class meetings. Certain students will be
asked in advance to prepare brief summaries of reading assignments and to
raise questions about an author's method and use of evidence as a basis for
discussion. All students are expected to complete the readings. I have limited
the number of pages in assigned readings to keep the reading assignment
manageable, though of course you may disagree with my notion of what that
means. The syllabus is also on-line at
http://maxweber.hunter.cuny.edu/polsc/polsky/index.html.  


2\. Attend class regularly and participate. Contribution to the class
discussion will be considered in the calculation of the final grade for the
course. Please note that you will be invited (but not required) to attend the
one or two meetings of the New York Colloquium on American Political
Development that will be held this term at the Graduate Center.  


3\. Complete the final exam. We will decide together whether the final exam
will be an in-class exercise or a take-home exam. Please note: either way, you
must complete the exam by the scheduled due date. I will grant extensions for
documented, valid reasons, and such extensions shall only be for a period
equal to the time you were unable to perform. Students who do not complete the
final exam will not be able to pass the course and will not be given an
incomplete grade.  


4\. Complete the research paper. As an 800-level research seminar, this course
requires a substantial research paper of standard journal-article length
(20-25 pages). I encourage you to select a topic that reflects your major
interest in political science insofar as that overlaps the content of the
course. For example, if comparative politics is your major, you may wish to do
a paper comparing some aspect of American political development to that of
another nation; if you are primarily interested in international relations,
consider doing a paper on the development of American foreign policy or on how
international events have shaped domestic American development; etc. The
research paper may use existing secondary literature to explain some aspect of
American political development or may rely upon original research using
archival and other sources. To get a sense of how research in American
political development is presented, I recommend you review issues of _Studies
in American Political Development_ or _Journal of Policy History_.  


I will require that you identify a topic and prepare a preliminary
bibliography by a specified date during the semester. Failure to do so will,
again, make you ineligible for an incomplete grade in the course. The schedule
of topics below contains many bibliographic citations that may serve as a
useful starting point for your research. Late in the term students will give
an oral presentation to the seminar in which they will state the central
theoretical problem or question that guides their research, identify the
specific historical outcome(s) they seek to explain, present a "causal story"
that connects causal factors to the outcome(s), and indicate their plan for
carrying out the research needed to investigate the posited causal connection.  


_Grading_  


Grading for the course will be based on the following:

Class participation and preparation: 25%

Final exam: 25%

Research paper: 50%

As indicated above, you must maintain "satisfactory progress" in the course in
order to complete it in good standing or to be eligible for an incomplete
grade. You cannot attend sporadically, fail to submit a paper topic or present
it to the class, tell me you are unprepared for the final exam, and then
expect to receive an incomplete. It is my goal to ensure that you have
finished all in-semester course requirements and made a serious start on their
research paper before the summer.  


_Books for Purchase_  


The titles listed here are available through the Hunter College Bookstore,
operated by Barnes and Noble, located at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street.
Note that these books are also on reserve at the Graduate School library.
Review the number of chapters assigned before you decide whether you wish to
purchase the book. Additional required readings have been compiled in a course
pack, which is also available for purchase at the Hunter College Bookstore.
One copy of the course pack has been placed on library reserve, too, but you
may find it inconvenient to use the reserve copy and I cannot guarantee
availability.

**Schedule of Class Topics and Assignments**  


Required readings are preceded by a double asterisk. You should read them in
the order in which they are listed. Additional readings for each topic (listed
alphabetically) are intended as a guide to further research. These readings
may be linked to the assigned reading by common methodology or substantive
overlap. I expect that one class session will be shortened or canceled so we
can attend the New York Colloquium on American Political Development, which
will be held at the CUNY Graduate School. If that happens, subsequent classes
will lag one week beyond the dates listed here.

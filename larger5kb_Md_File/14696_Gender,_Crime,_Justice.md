> > This course focuses on women as victims and as criminal offenders. It also
looks at the role women  play as workers in justice occupations. It draws on
the feminist critique of mainstream criminological theory and aims toward
formulating a feminist approach to issues of gender, crime, and justice.

>> ###  **_Course Grade_**

>>

>>  
> _10% Quiz:_ The quiz is given early in the semester so you can evaluate your
progress within the drop period. You will be asked to answer multiple choice
questions, define terms and explain a theory.

>>

>> _20% Exam 1, 20% Exam 2, and 20% Final_ : Your exams and final follow the
same format: objection questions, identification questions, and short essay
questions.

>>

>> _20% Paper_ : The assignment is  posted on the Web (see week one in course
schedule). To prepare for it, find a television show that 1) is about crime or
criminal justice, 2) features females in leading or recurring roles, and 3) is
good enough to watch on a regular basis. Tape two episodes.

>>

>> _10% Participation_ : Participation sessions are scheduled randomly
throughout the semester. They cannot be made up.  
>  
>>

>> ###  **_Rules of the Road_**

>>

>>  
> _Absences:_ Students are responsible for meeting all course requirements,
including getting the class notes which may contain changes to the syllabus,
for the days they miss. Excessive absences usually result in poor performance
on exams and papers.

>>

>> _Missed Exams_ : Students should arrange for an early exam if they plan to
be away for an exam date. Those who miss an exam are required to contact the
professor within 24 hours to discuss _the possibility_ of taking a make up
exam. To qualify for a make up test, students _must provide written
documentation to the professor_ that the absence was due to a change in
circumstance over which they had no control, e.g., sudden illness, last minute
job change, etc.

>>

>> _Late Papers:_ Papers are due by the end of the class period on the due day
designated in the syllabus. For each day the paper is late, a half grade is
deducted from the paper's earned grade. An "A" paper turned in 3 days late
would receive an "C." A "C" paper turned in 2 days late receive a low "D."

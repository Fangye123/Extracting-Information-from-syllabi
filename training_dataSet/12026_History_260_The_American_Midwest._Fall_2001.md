**Course description and required texts:**

This course offers an overview of America's heartland from the time of
European contact through the twentieth century. The term "Midwest" has been
applied to a large area - as many as twelve states - and implies that there is
a homogeneity about the region. In fact, the Midwest is diverse; it has a
rich, complex history, and it eludes clear definition. Often characterized as
hospitable and hard-working if wholesome and drab, Midwesterners themselves
are unclear about what it means to be Midwestern, though they sense that there
is something quintessentially American about it.  

Although the course considers the Midwest as a whole, it focuses on history of
the "eastern" or "lower" Midwest - the "Old Northwest" created in 1787. The
seventeenth century saw interaction among Native Americans and French
explorers, missionaries, trappers, and traders. Through the eighteenth
century, European powers and the new United States struggled to dominate the
region. In the nineteenth century, upland southerners, northerners, and
European immigrants settled as boosters praised the region as one of progress,
free labor, and prosperity, despite the displacement of Native Americans and
racism. The twentieth century was a time of industrialization, urbanization,
progressive politics and charges of provinciality, prosperity, a "rustbelt"
economy, and attempts at renaissance. As we look at this history, we can
ponder what being Midwestern means.

The required texts are:  

R. David Edmunds, _The Shawnee Prophet_  
John Mack Faragher, _Sugar Creek: Life on the Illinois Prairie_  
Lucy Eldersveld Murphy and Wendy Hamand Venet, eds., _Midwestern Women: Work,

Some required readings are on reserve in Duggan Library or online. There are
also several films.

exams: a midterm (25%) and a final (30%). Students are expected to take the

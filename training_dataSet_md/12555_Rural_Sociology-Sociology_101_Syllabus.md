### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course is designed to provide a general introduction to the discipline of
sociology. It is intended for students who have not previously taken a course
in sociology. The course provides an acquaintance with basic concepts
sociologists use to explain and understand the social world, and provides
interpretation and data on key social issues that face the nation and the
world.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES:

* 1\. To provide students with knowledge about the classical origins of sociology, as well as examples of contemporary social scientific research; 
* 2\. To introduce students to key sociological theories and concepts; 
* 3\. To introduce students to analytical approaches for achieving a critical understanding of social phenomena. 

### REQUIRED READINGS:

* Durkheim, Emile. 2001. The Elementary Forms of Religious Life; translated by Carol Cosman abridged with an introduction and notes by Mark S. Cladis. Oxford, NY: Oxford University Press. 
* Eve L. Howard. 2000.  Wadsworth Classic Readings in Sociology (Second Edition), Stamford, CT: Wadsworth. 
* Rodriguez, Luis. 1993.  Always Running, La Vida Loca: Gang Days in L.A.  Willimantic, CT: Curbstone Press.

* Watkins, William H. 2001.  The White Architects of Black Education: Ideology and Power in America, 1865-1954.  New York: Teachers College Press.

* **Recommended:** North, Douglass C. 1961.  The Economic Growth of the United States, 1790-1860. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall.

### REQUIREMENTS:

#### A. Examinations.

Three examinations (two preliminaries and one final). The two preliminaries
will be administered in regular fifty-minute class periods, and will consist
of closed-end questions (e.g., multiple choice) and open-end questions (essay
questions).

The final is take home and consists solely of essay questions. Students will
be given the exam questions during the final week of class, and must return
answers to their respective T.A.s no later than noon on the last day of study
period, December 11. For each day that the final exam is late, one letter will
be subtracted. So, for example, if an exam is turned in on December 12, the
highest grade that student could obtain is a B. No exams will be accepted
after December 13.

#### B. Attendance.

Students are expected to attend all lectures, movies, and discussion sections.
The lectures will not merely summarize the readings, and the discussion
sections will not be devoted to only reviewing the lecture and/or reading
material. Group discussion and verbal engagement is a critical learning
pathway in the social sciences.

Since discussion grades will be based partly upon attendance and the material
covered in section, it is essential that students attend these sections.
Situations may occasionally arise that will make it impossible for a student
to attend his/her own section. A student may attend another section if he/she
obtains **prior approval** of that section's T.A.

#### C. Discussion Sections.

Each student is assigned to a discussion section, which is led by a graduate
teaching assistant. The discussion sections meet once a week. Discussion
sections are designed to stimulate discussion and debate focused around a
basic purpose of the course: using sociology to understand the major forces
that are shaping the modern world. You and your classmates are actively
encouraged to develop skills using sociological concepts through discussions
with others about how societies are changing, why they are changing, and the
positive and negative implications of these changes. **Students are required
to read the section and lecture readings prior to attending section.**

#### D. Extra Credit.

Students have the option of pursuing one of two extra credit projects. First,
students may analyze school survey data collected by the course instructor,
and write a three to five page typed, double-spaced report. The data are
available on the course WWW page in three formats (SPSS, SAS and Excel), and
can be downloaded and processed on a personal computer. Data codebooks are
available from Beverley Wells in room 134 Warren Hall. To obtain extra credit,
students are expected to perform bivariate analyses on one dependent variable
that measures suicide: thoughts about suicide, suicide plans, or suicide
attempts. This project will be further described in lecture, but it should be
noted that students unfamiliar with statistical analysis may have difficulty
pursuing this option. The course is not designed to teach statistics.

Second, students may initiate an independent social science research project.
This could be, for example, field observation of a social movement. Three
requirements are necessary to obtain credit for this option. First, the
project must engage core concepts from the course. Second, the student must
provide documentation of primary or secondary data gathering and write a three
to five page typed, double-spaced final report. The final report must set out
a research question (or hypothesis), describe how the research activity
engages the research question, and then discuss the conceptual/theoretical
implications of the research.

Extra credit reports, along with accompanying documentation, must be turned
into the student's teaching assistant on or before the final section meeting.

#### E. Core Concepts

Sociology is a science organized around concepts. Therefore, a central task of
the course is defining, applying and reformulating scientific concepts. A list
of core concepts will be mained on the course web page, and this list will be
supplemented and modified as the course proceeds. When studying for class
examinations, students are well advised to consult this list, and to gain
familiarity with the concepts.

### Grading:

* Prelim 1 - 25 percent 
* Prelim 2 - 25 percent 
* Final Exam - 30 percent 
* Discussion Section - 20 percent 
* TOTAL - 100 percent 
* Extra Creidt - 10 percent 

Each student in this course is expected to abide by the Cornell University
Code of Academic Integrity. Any work submitted by a student in this course for
academic credit will be the student's own work.

#### Review Sessions

Review sessions will precede both prelims and the final exam. The time and
place will be announced in lecture and in section and be posted on the RS101
home page.

Ecological Imperialism:  
The Environmental Consequences of Early Modern European Expansion**

_Is this area of Texas more productive, more fulfilling of God's purpose-are
we playing our role of destiny with this broad expanse of Texas-then when
there were five thousand Indians here eating insects?  
_** -Bill Clements, successful candidate for Governor of Texas, 1978.  
  
  
In this course we will look at two kinds of environmental history: people's
perceptions of the natural world and also human interaction with the world
around them. These are somewhat distinct yet interrelated subjects. How people
regard nature influences the way they treat it. Conversely, their physical
environment influences their perceptions of nature. This environment imposes
limitations on humans, but also offers possibilities. How people view nature
influences their choice of which possibility they will pursue.  
  
This is particularly clear in the case of the Columbian "encounter". The
arrival of European humans in the Americas was a clash of several things.
Certainly it was a clash of cultural, religious, and political systems. But it
was also the meeting of quite different ecological systems, including flora,
fauna, and microorganisms. It was also a meeting of very distinct views of
nature, of humans' place in nature, and of the purpose of nature. While
factors such as greed and intolerance played a crucial role in the European
invasion of America, the conception of creation and the creatures that they
brought with them can be seen as equally important in contributing to that
conquest. Furthermore, the Europeans not only reshaped the societies they
conquered, but also the natural environment they encountered.  
  
In this course we will examine questions such as why it was that Europeans
conquered Americans, rather than the other way round. What help did they get
from plants, animals and microorganisms? Why did such non-human agents
generally help the Europeans but harm the native Americans? How did the
physical environment of the Americas change from 1492 to 1700? What effect did
this have on the indigenous inhabitants?

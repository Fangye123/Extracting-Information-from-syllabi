_Course Description

_ This course will guide the students through the past century of Russian
history, including the Romanovs, Soviets, and the current Federal regimes.  It
will be primarily a course of political history, though it will include
elements of intellectual, social and cultural history as required.  We will
seek continuities and change in the three regimes that have pushed Russia
along its course. |

A [pdf copy](SovietExper.pdf) of the syllabus is available.  You can also call
or [e-mail me](mailto:rb3@duke.edu) for one, or come to class or my office. |

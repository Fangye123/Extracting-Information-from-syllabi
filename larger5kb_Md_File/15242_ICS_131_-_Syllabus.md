### Course Description

    
    
    This course provides you with an introduction of computerization as a
    social process.  It examines the social opportunities and problems raised
    by new information technologies, and the consequences of different ways of
    organization.  Topics include computerization and work life, privacy,
    virtual communities, productivity paradox, systems risks.
    

### Prerequisites

    
    
    ICS 1A or Engineering 10 or Engineering ECE11
    ICS 21 or equivalent
    upper division standing
    lower-division writing requirement
    

### Required Text

    
    
    The required text for this course is:
    
            Rob Kling (1996).  Computerization and Controversy:  Value
    Conflicts and Social Choices.  (Second Edition).  San Diego, CA:  Academic
    Press.
    
    If needed, additional course notes will be made available through the
    engineering copy center.
    

### Grading

    
    
    This class is about ideas, feelings, opinions, perspectives, and above all
    else, expression.
    
    Tuesday in-class exercises:     10%     Other Notebook entries:         25%
    Thursday in-class quizzes:      10%     ics.131a participation:         5%
    First section summary:          5%      TRW and newsgroup exercises:    5%
    Second summary:                 15%     Discussion participation:       10%
    Third summary:                  15%
    
    You will express yourself in verbal discussion, in email, in writing, and
    in presenting.  There is further description of these assignments at the
    end of this document.
    

### In-class exercises

    
    
    Most Tuesdays involve an in-class exercise carried out by groups of about
    5.  Sometimes there is pre-class preparation for these exercises, but often
    there isn't.  After the first week, the groups are assigned, and
    periodically change.  Full credit requires making one of your group
    presentations to the class.
    

### In-class quizzes

    
    
    Most Thursdays include a brief in-class quiz.  Typically, these are
    open-book, focus on one reading for that week, and the quiz question is
    described in advance on ics.131a.
    

### Notebooks

    
    
    Your Course Notebook will contain one-page reviews of each assigned
    reading, along with the topic summaries and materials collected for
    discussion section activities. The Notebook will be graded the third,
    sixth, and final weeks.
    

### Notebook article reviews

    
    
    Each review should be on a separate page or pages, headed by the article's
    title and author. The review should first indicate the style (e.g. academic
    or informal) and audience for the article, then summarize in a few clear
    sentences the main argument of the article. Then you should describe your
    reaction or a personal experience related to the article of a part of it.
    Your personal experience, insight, reaction, or reasoned argument is
    essential.
    

### Topic summaries (with outside material)

    
    
    The readings are divided into six topics. You will write three 3-to-5 page
    section summaries, each tying together material from the assigned articles
    in one section. It should also cite 2 new sources; one can be another
    reading in the book, the second should be an outside source. Each summary
    should also contain your opinions and experiences related to the material
    in the section. Your first summary will cover the first reading topic. For
    your second summary you can choose either the second or third topic. Your
    third summary will cover one of the final three topics.
    

### Newsgroup participation

    
    
    Everyone posts at least 3 messages to ics.131a: your reaction to an
    assigned reading, and two responses to postings by other students.
    

### Discussion section activities and participation

    
    
    Some activities in discussion section require advanced preparation.
    

### Policy on missed exercises, missed quizzes, and late Notebooks

    
    
    In-class activities cannot be made up unless the instructor is notified in
    advance of the absence.  Notebook entries must be turned in together and
    lose 10% for each day late.
    

### Computer Usage

    
    
    You should use your UNIX accounts to access the bulletin board at least
    once a day.  The instructor and teaching assistant will post messages
    including details of the assignments in this fashion.  You will need to use
    email to arrange office hours, etc.  You will need to post messages to the
    needs groups to complete some of the assignments.

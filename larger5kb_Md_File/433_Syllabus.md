_Academic Integrity._ Students have the responsibility to know and observe the
requirements of _The UNCC Code of Student Academic Integrity_ (Catalog p. 25).
This code forbids cheating, fabrication or falsification of information,
multiple submission of academic work, plagiarism, abuse of academic materials,
and complicity in academic dishonesty. Any special requirements or permission
regarding academic integrity in this course will be stated by the instructor,
and are binding on the students. Academic evaluations in this course include a
judgment that the student's work is free from academic dishonesty of any type;
and grades in this course therefore should be and will be adversely affected
by academic dishonesty. Students who violate the code can be expelled from
UNCC. The normal penalty for a first offense is zero credit on the work
involving dishonesty and further substantial reduction of the course grade. In
almost all cases the course grade is reduced to an F. Copies of the code can
be obtained from the Dean of Students Office. Students are expected to report
cases of academic dishonesty to the course instructor.

_Disability Services._ Students with documented disabilities requiring
accommodation in this course should contact Disability Services in Fretwell
230.

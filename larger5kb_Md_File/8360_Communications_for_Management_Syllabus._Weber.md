![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**6\. FORM OF EVALUATION**  
  
**Class Assignments and Homework.** The [cases](../resources/caseanal.htm),
problems, and exercises assigned are to be done completely, neatly and on time
according to the more complete instructions given in class at the time of the
assignments. The classwork and assignments must be kept in a notebook that may
be checked periodically. The notebook will serve as a cross check against
instructor records.  
**![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
Term-Project Presentation. ** The research, on an approved _management
communication_ topic, will be presented to the class using presentation
software. Presentations of the research approximately seven to eleven minutes
in length will be made to measure the ability to communicate and clearly
inform the audience about the nature of the problem, background, methods,
findings, and conclusions of the project. The use of audio-visual aids is
MANDATORY during the presentation. Grades will be assigned on the basis of
peer and instructor evaluations and Certificates awarded to the presentations
judged most effective by the class.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**Examinations.** The examinations may consist of written communications
(letters, memos, etc.), multiple choice, true/false, and essay questions that
measure the ability to know and apply principles of good communication. [(Be
sure to use the Study Guide (password required.)](password/index.html) Other
types of questions may be included. The questions will cover the lectures,
class discussions, activities, videos, exercises, and textbooks. The mid-term
and final may include multiple choice questions on the test as well as
application exercises (memos, letters, etc.) prepared on the computer and
printed.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**7\. METHOD OF ASSIGNING LETTER GRADES**  
  
**Grades** are assigned based on the evaluations of each student's work
compared to others in the class and in previous sections of this class. The
percentages indicated in 5, above, and the grading system in the 1999-2001
University Catalog are factors. A system of [Stanines (Standard Nine-Point
Scale)](curve.gif) is used to calculate the value of grades. Letter grades (A,
B, C, D, or F) are assigned on the basis of the instructor's evaluation of
student work compared with the work of other students completing classwork. An
I (Incomplete) grade will be given only if sufficient, but not all, work has
been completed for good cause. The I may be changed to a letter grade only
when all work is completed according to University Policy.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**Bonus Incentive Points** (BIPs) may be earned to improve poor test grades,
make up for unavoidable absences or late assignments, etc., or to raise the
final grade received. Bonus work consists of additional work similar to
regular classwork. (Examples include: properly completed end-of-chapter
application exercises, questions, message analyses, grammar workshops,
arranging a guest speaker, [Periodical Reports--Abstract and Analysis with
Applications](../325/aa.html)). Up to a maximum of one letter grade may be
earned with BIPs. See instructor and web pages for additional details.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

**8\. POLICY ON ATTENDANCE , CLASS PARTICIPATION, AND MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS**  
  
**Attendance, attitude, and preparation** are important. Positive
contributions to the class can provide rich reciprocal learning experiences.
The right attitude means: a desire and willingness to study and learn,
preparation as directed, and putting forth effort even when it may be
inconvenient or difficult. It also means: being ready to answer questions when
called upon, volunteering answer to questions or asking questions (even when
you feel they may seem a little "dumb"), and actively listening to the
instructor and other class members. Carrying too many units, working too many
hours, etc., (usually symptoms of poor time management) will not be given much
consideration in the determination of the final grade.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

**Absences** (as well as tardies) will definitely negatively affect grades.
Make-up exams are exceptions, and only given on the basis of
instructor/student agreement for significant and compelling reasons. The total
number of absences/tardies, regardless of the reason, determine the grade for
this portion of the course. Memorandums to the instructor explaining necessary
absences can mitigate their effect and BIPs can help offset the impact of
absences. The attendance portion of the grade is calculated as shown below,
modified by attitude, classwork, and participation. ****  

**ABSENCES AND GRADES** (2 Tardies = 1 Absence)  
  
**Number of Absences**

  * 0 = A   

  * 1 = A-  

  * 2 = B   

  * 3= B-  

  * 4 = C   

  * 5 = D   

  * 6 or more = F 

![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**9\. STUDENT PREPARATION**  
  
Students are expected to have all lessons, papers, presentations, etc.,
prepared on the dates indicated, to come class with the required materials, to
take notes, and to read the assignments by the dates due. Assignments turned
in late will receive one-half grade lower than they would earn if on time.  
![](../arrowup.gif)  
  

###

  
**10\. ADD-DROP POLICY**  
Detailed information regarding "Add/Drop Policies and the Assignment of
Incomplete Grades" is available in the Student Advising Center, Building 6,
Room 218, from your Department Office, and from the University Catalog.

##  **_ECONOMICS 114  
SEMINAR IN AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY_**  
Meetings: Tues 2 - 5 p.m., 45 Evans

* * *

Economics 114 is an undergraduate seminar in topics in U.S. economic history.
This semester we will look at the "common wisdom" about various aspects of
economic history that we gain from popular films and assess the accuracy or
inaccuracy of that "wisdom" gained from film. In addition, term papers will be
required for this course. Economics 114 is especially recommended for junior
economics majors who anticipate writing a senior thesis. The term papers
written in undergraduate seminars can become the basis for a senior honor's
thesis.  


**_Adding the Course_**  
Enrollment is limited to 25 students. Economics 114 is heavily oversubscribed.
Most of the people on the waiting list will not be able to enroll in the
course this semester. You must have passed Economics 113 in a previous
semester in order to take this course. Priority is given to economics majors.  


**_Professor's Office Hours_**  
Professor Olney, 691 Evans Hall, 642-6083, MOlney@econ.berkeley.edu  
Drop-in: Mondays & Thursdays 2:30-3:30 p.m. Other times by appointment.  


**_Prerequisite_**  
Economics 113 is a prerequisite for this course. This prerequisite will be
enforced.  


**_Required Textbook and Reader_**  
There is no textbook or reader for the course.  


**_Goals for This Seminar and Strategy_**  
I have three primary goals for this course. First, I want you to acquire an
appreciation for the influence of pop culture; we often learn our "history"
from the movies. Second, I want you to further develop your critical thinking
and viewing skills. And third, I want you to develop research skills.  


To accomplish these goals, we will have four three-week "modules." During week
1's meeting, we will watch a film that either directly or indirectly offers
lessons about some aspect of U.S. economic history. We will watch with pen in
hand, and with an eye toward picking out what the filmmaker has stated about
the economy. During week 2's meeting, we will discuss what economic history we
saw in the film, develop research questions based on the "assertions" in the
film, and plan our research. During week 3's meeting, you will turn in and
discuss a 4 - 7 page paper reporting on the research you have conducted.  


In addition, your critical thinking and research skills will be developed
through the writing of a research term paper, discussed in detail below.  


**_Responsibilities and Requirements_**  
My responsibilities are to come to class prepared, encourage appropriate class
participation, promptly grade and return papers, be available during scheduled
office hours and as possible for scheduled appointments, and stimulate an
enthusiasm for economics, for history, and for learning.  


Your responsibilities are to attend and participate in the seminar three hours
per week, attentively watch the film during class time (or, if you are unable
to attend, in the Media Center of Moffitt Library within days of the class
viewing), participate in the research design, complete all assignments on
time, and write a term paper.

**_Course Grades_**  
Your course grade will depend upon your performance on the following, with
weights as indicated:  
Class participation         10 %  
Paper due February 18 15 %  
Paper due March 18     15 %  
Paper due April 15        15 %  
Term paper                    45 %

Students taking the course under the P/NP option must earn a grade of C- in
order to pass the course.

**_Special Accommodations_**  
If you require special accommodations due to learning or other disability, you
must speak with Professor Olney **no later than February 11.** You will need
to obtain an evaluation form from Disabled Students' Program (230 Golden Bear
Center).

**_Letter of Introduction_**  
For our second meeting, please write a one-page letter of introduction of
yourself to Professor Olney. Include your name and anything about yourself
that you would like to share. This may be typed or handwritten. It will not be
graded nor returned.

**_Term Paper_**  
An important requirement for this course is a term paper. You should choose a
topic in U.S. economic history. It need not be suggested by the films we
watch, but it should be about some aspect of U.S. economic _history_. All
paper topics must be approved by Professor Olney. Most students try to choose
a topic that is far too broad (for example, "Slavery in the U.S."). It is
simply impossible to write anything interesting on such a broad topic in 15-20
pages. For most people, the challenge is narrowing the topic down. For
example, "Evidence of Nutritional Attainment in African Slaves in the American
South" is a topic that is probably narrow enough to allow the writing of an
interesting and worthwhile paper.

If you do not have an initial topic of interest, I suggest two strategies.
First, thumb through your Economics 113 textbook and make a list of the topics
that particularly interested you. One of those topics might provide the basis
for a term paper topic. Second, go to the library and thumb through old issues
of _Journal of Economic History_ , _Journal of Interdisciplinary History_ ,
_Social Science History_ , or _Journal of Social History_. Keep a list of the
papers that particularly interested you. If neither of these strategies turns
up a topic that is of interest to you, then you really should not be taking
this seminar.

You will need to be well-organized in your use of time this semester in order
to complete the requirements for this seminar. To help you along, there are
three preliminary deadlines and one final deadline connected with the term
paper.  


**Topic Idea Due Tuesday, February 25**  
This should be a topic you have narrowed down at least somewhat. In class on
February 25, your classmates will help you refine your topic as need be.
You'll turn in a draft of your topic idea on February 25 and a refined draft
on March 4. Professor Olney will give you feedback on your topic idea.

**Bibliography Due Tuesday, April 1**  
This should be an annotated bibliography of at least seven items. At least one
item must be a primary source, not a secondary one. "Annotated" means that you
need to write a short paragraph about each item in the bibliography,
summarizing what is in the item and how it will be useful to your research.

**First Draft Due Tuesday, April 22**  
This can have some "holes" in it, but not many. There should be at least 10
usable pages of text in your first draft. The first draft should reflect a
carefully thought-out outline of the paper. It may not have all the empirical
work completed; there may be some literature you have not yet consulted; it
will still need some work. But it should be possible from this first draft to
have a clear idea of where you are headed with your final draft.

**Final Draft Due Friday, May 9, 5:00 p.m.**  
15-20 pages. Double-spaced. One-inch margins on all sides. Pages numbered.
Reasonable font size. Tables imbedded in text. Something you're proud of.

**_Academic Honesty Policy_**  
In fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be treated
harshly. Any evidence of cheating will result in a score of zero (0) on that
assignment or paper. Cheating on the term paper will result in a failing grade
(F) for the course. Incidences of cheating will be reported to the Office of
Student Conduct, which may administer additional punishment. Cheating includes
plagiarism. Plagiarism includes appropriation of whole passages with or
without credit, appropriation of words and phrases without credit,
appropriation of both main and supporting ideas without credit, and
paraphrasing without credit. Plagiarism also includes submitting a paper
written by someone else. If you are unsure of how to properly cite sources, be
sure to ask Professor Olney for guidance.

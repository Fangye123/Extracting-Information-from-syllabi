### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is an introductory survey of the content, concepts, and methods of
American Indian Studies. Exposure to the diverse American Indian cultures,
political systems, and social organizations inhabiting North America from time
immemorial to the present are explored through the use of oral traditions,
written literature, and art forms.

* * *

### COURSE PHILOSOPHY

A University classroom is one of the few places left on mother earth where
students have total intellectual freedom. We are all students, albeit with
abilities varying in sophistication and development. Therefore, do not be
hesitant to express yourself through oral and written exercises. Dialogue is
an important part of the learning process, especially in societies that are
historically based on oral traditions. We will in effect use dialogue to
reinforce other learning activities. I prefer that you share your thoughts
with the class.

This course should also be used to enhance your chosen career by obtaining a
multicultural view of our present day society. With exposure to another's
viewpoint, a better understanding of culture and its intrinsic workings should
enable you to have a clearer interpretation of how it affects people's
interactions.

* * *

### ATTENDANCE

Class attendance is mandatory. You are accountable for ideas, dialogue,
visuals, and discussions from assigned readings that will be shared only in
the classroom.

* * *

### ASSESSMENT

Your grade will be based on two examinations, the first scheduled before
midterm, the final as scheduled, a map test, and a genealogy project. This
class is also subject to unannounced quizzes. No extra credit work is
accepted.

Map Exam=50 points, Midterm=125 points, Final=150 points, Genealogy=50 points,
Attendance=25 points

100-93=A, 92-85=B, 84-76=C, 75-68=D, 67-00=failed to meet minimum standards

* * *

### COMPUTER LITERACY

You are encouraged to obtain access to and gain facility with the University
of South Dakota's computer network. I will periodically provide updates on
events, readings, and other pertinent matters on this syllabus and post them
on the Institute of American Indian Studies website.

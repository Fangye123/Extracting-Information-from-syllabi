**English 333: Theater in England**  
**CRN 52733**  
**Winter Session**

**Professor Russell A. Peck**

English 333 will be conducted in London and Stratford-upon-Avon between the
fall and spring semesters, from December 29, 2001, to January 12, 2002 (15
days). The course will include approximately 20 plays. London is the theater
capital of the world, with a stunning array of plays available every day. We
will see the best of what is running, with a diverse selection of plays from
all periods of drama over the past 2500 years, from tragedy and comedy to
pantomime and musicals. Most of the London plays will be in the West End or at
the Barbican or National Theatres, though we will make a point of seeing a
couple of plays on the fringe, where some of the best new theater originates.
We will make a day trip to Stratford-upon-Avon to see two plays, visit
Shakespeare's birthplace, and get a feel for an English village that dates
from antiquity. The schedule of plays seen over the past three years are
attached below. We will take tours of the National Theatre and the newly
restored Globe theatre, which traces its origins back to the late 1500's and
where several of Shakespeare's plays were first performed. There will be ample
time to sightsee, visit museums, shop, and explore. I have appended to the
syllabus of last winter two paragraphs describing all the "extra" activities
besides plays that students undertook during our fifteen days in London.

We will be staying at the Harlingford Hotel in Bloomsbury, near the British
Museum and the new British Library, the area in which Virginia Woolf and the
Bloomsbury group lives as did Charles Dickens and Karl Marx. The course
carries

4 credits. The registration fee is $1875.00, which includes tuition, housing,
play tickets, and transportation between London and Stratford. Students make
their own travel arrangements to and from London. A non-refundable downpayment
of $675 is due on October 5. The remaining $1200.00 will be billed to your
University account in December. You will need to leave the United States on
the evening of December 27 or the morning of December 28, at the latest.
Return flights may be scheduled for Sunday, January 13\. The UR spring
semester begins on Wednesday, January 16, 2002.

Although all students saw at least 22 plays, they were involved in a host of
other activities as well. Foremost, perhaps, is the fact that everyone got to
know London. We did a lot of walking during the day and often at night would
walk back to the hotel after plays, past the **British Museum** and
**Bloomsbury Square**. Everyone went to several museums to see special
exhibits as well as permanent collections. For example, the exhibits on The
Great Court, Picasso, and Correggio and Parmigianino at the **British Museum**
(though mainly people simply wandered through the vast number of permanent
holdings); the William Blake and Oscar Wilde exhibits at the new **British
Library** ; the Turner exhibit as well as the splendid 19th and 20th century
holdings in the **Tate Britain** ; exhibits on modern art, the nude, modern
architecture, machinery, history, and memory at the new **Tate Modern** ; the
fabulous permanent collections of Western European paintings in the **National
Gallery** ; the national archive of portraiture at the **National Portrait
Gallery** ; the brilliant Spectatular Bodies exhibit at the **Hayward** ; the
Dali Universe at the **County Hall, South Bank** ; the Hermitage Rooms, the
Gilbert Collection, and the treasures of Catherine the Great at **Somerset
House** ; the permanent collection of impressionist and post-impressionist
painting and the Early Renaissance Gallery of Flemish and Italian Art at the
**Courtauld Institute** ; the **Imperial War Museum** , with its holocaust
exhibit and exhibit on the history of spies in England; the **Churchill
Cabinet Rooms** , which are preserved as churchill and his staff left them at
the end of World War II; the watercolours of Turner at the **Royal Academy of
Art** ; the Imperfect Beauty and the Commercial Art exhibits at the **Victoria
and Albert Museums** ; the **London Theatre Museum** ; The Wilde Years at the
**Barbican** ; exhibits at the **Public Record Office** ; and the always
exciting **Natural History Museum**.  


Students also visited famous places in London, such as **The Tower** with its
special exhibit of the Doomsday Book, **Parliament** and Big Ben, **St. Paul's
Cathedral** , the restored **Globe Theater** and museum, **Hampstead Heath** ,
**Kew Gardens** , **Hyde Park and the Speaker's Corner** , **Buckingham
Palace** and the changing of the guard, **Westminster Abbey** and the poet's
corner, **Dickens House** , **Abbey Road** , **Kenwood House** with its
Vermeer collection, **Covent Garden** , **Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum** , the
**Wimbleton Tennis Museum** , and **Harrods** , as well as famous pubs like
the **Sherlock Holmes** , John Dryden's favorite pub **The Lamb and the
Staff** , and the **King's Head Pub** where actors of the Royal Shakespeare
Company gather after plays. In **Stratford** students visited Shakespeare's
birthplace, his grammer school, and Holy Trinity Church, where he is buried.
In London some rode the spectacular **London Eye** (the giant ferris wheel
built for the millenium that now graces the south bank of the Thames -- a
marvel of architectural beauty comparable to the Eiffel Tower in Paris).
Students also went to music events such as evensong at **St. Paul's
Cathedral** ; some went to hear the Cathedral Chamber choir sing Herbert
Howells' _Collegium regale_ and Francis Poulenc's _O magnum mysterium_ at
**Westminster Abbey** on one day and the Collegiate Singers performing Tomas
Luis de Victoria's _Missa O magnum mysterium_ on another. Several also went to
free noontime and evening concerts of secular music at **St. Martin of the
Fields**. And a few went to **Stonehenge** and **Windsor Castle**.

## Course Description

This course familiarizes students with fundamental issues and concerns that
underlie the practices of inquiry in political science. To this end, we will
contrast various contemporary schools of metascience, the prescriptions of
which condition those practices.

The political science faculty requires this course of all its doctoral
students because it provides conceptual foundations useful in students' other
courses and in their research planning. For these reasons, students should
undertake this course in their first year.

In previous offerings of this course, a few students expressed the anxiety
that the course fails to treat one or another of their most cherished
theoretical formulations. This is purposeful. We aim to recover the
_metatheories_ (or theories of theory) that underpin empirical political
theories. Specific theories of political action will arise naturally, of
course. However, if we are to achieve the goal of understanding the bases
available to us for theory construction, we necessarily must restrict our
focus to metatheory.

## Books

Each student should obtain a copy of each of the following books. They have
been ordered through the Orange Student Bookstore in Marshall Square.

  * Dallmayr, Fred R., and Thomas A. McCarthy, eds. _Understanding and Social Inquiry_. Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 1977. 
  * Kuhn, Thomas S. _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962. 
  * Lakatos, Imre, and Alan Musgrave, eds. _Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970. 
  * Magee, Bryan. _Philosophy and the Real World_. LaSalle, Indiana: Open Court, 1985. 
  * John R. Hall. _Cultures of Inquiry: From Epistemology to Discourse in Sociohistorical Research_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999. 
  * Putnam, Hilary. _Realism with a Human Face_. Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1990. 
  * Rescher, Nicholas. _Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge_. Albany: SUNY Press, 1977\. 
We will read all or most of most of these books. The exceptions are the essay
collections (Putnam, Dallmayr and McCarthy, Lakatos and Musgrave). We will
read about 25%, 50%, and 90% of each, respectively. Nevertheless, each is made
available for purchase since each is worth owning. Essays in these volumes
that are not listed as required reading should be considered suggested
reading. Additional readings will be distributed in class and/or placed on
reserve in Bird Library.

**Bulletin:** I have just learned that the Magee volume and the Dallmayr and
McCarthy reader are not presently available from their respective publishers.
Consequently, they will be placed on reserve. You may also be able to borrow a
copy from last year's students (i.e., most second-year doctoral students).

## Course Requirements

Each student will produce a final paper that reviews the intellectual
accomplishments of a faculty member in the Maxwell School. These reviews serve
two purposes. First, they exercise intellectual constructs discussed over the
course of the semester. Second, they encourage students to familiarize
themselves with the intellectual pursuits of a faculty member, perhaps one
with whom they wish to work.

To expose all students to a wide range of these intellectual pursuits, and
also to exercise students' skills in oral presentation, each student will
present in class a preliminary report of their final paper.

Student presentations will follow an in-class examination on the course
material. This examination will ask very general essay questions pertaining to
issues discussed in class and in the readings. Students may refer to their
books and notes during this examination.

Students are required to select in advance the faculty member whose work they
will review, and students will clear their selection with the instructor. As
they prepare their reviews, students are encouraged to consult with the
faculty members whose work they will review.

## Grading Criteria

Final grades for this course will be assigned on the following basis:

  * Examination (30%). 
  * Final paper (30%). 
  * Presentation (20%). 
  * Participation (20%). 
The presentation and paper grades will be assessed on the basis of the clarity
and thoughfulness of the work, with special emphasis on the integration of
course materials into students' reviews. The participation grade will be
assessed on the basis of the quality and quantity of students' participation
in seminar.

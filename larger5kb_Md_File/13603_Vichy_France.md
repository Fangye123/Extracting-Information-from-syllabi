**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course explores the French experience of World War II. Through primary
and secondary sources, we investigate Germany's occupation of France and
French collaboration with and resistance to the Nazis, in particular in the
Holocaust. We also consider the turn-of-the-century roots of these responses
in the Dreyfus Affair, the interwar spread of French fascism and conservative
authoritarianism, the rise of a Popular Front of the Left in opposition to
fascism, as well as how selective remembrance and forgetfulness contributed to
forging a postwar French national identity. World War II and the Holocaust
will thus be placed within the longer perspective of the French twentieth
century.

We will thereby examine one of the most fascinating, important, challenging,
and multifaceted subjects in human history: people's cowardly, indifferent, or
courageous responses to the unprecedented attempt to destroy an entire race.
In our focus on the French role in collaborating with or resisting this
attempt, a series of categories fundamental to human life and culture will
come under scrutiny. As Jews and French resistors escaped, hid, or were
killed, French men and women helped or failed to help in all areas. This
situation will force us to think critically about the importance of the
concepts of race and ethnicity, but also more generally of identity, community
and citizenship, as well as the relations of memory and history.

**COURSE STRUCTURE**

We begin by establishing the basic facts of the Occupation and the Holocaust,
moving to consider the particular roots of French antisemitism and the more
general cultural geography of the 1930s, before we focus intently and
extensively on the years 1940-1944. After setting the scene, each week is
organized around a theme. The themes follow each other chronologically, and we
spend a full eight weeks on the four years 1940-1944 from defeat to
liberation. The required readings are listed in the order that we read them,
available for purchase in the Bookstore, and placed on reserve in the Library
(wherever possible). The reading is not arduous, and is extremely interesting,
averaging less than 100 pages a week and ranging from scholarly texts to
memoirs. We will also view and discuss films.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

This course will be run as a seminar, which requires that you come to class
having completed the reading assignment for each week and are prepared to
discuss it. To help prepare you for these discussions, there is generally a
corresponding writing assignment for each reading. These include an analytic
**summation** of the text that indicates what is discussed in each section of
a text and gives some of your own analysis of the text (2 pages). When no
paper is required, we will generally begin class with a short **in-class**
writing assignment. There are also two **presentations** that will be done in
groups. Finally, you will write three short **papers** : one that analyzes how
Charlotte Delbo deals with the problem of representing the horrors of life in
the concentration camps, a second uses Tzvetan Todorov's _French Tragedy_ to
discuss the ethics of violent resistance to an oppressive regime and a third
that assesses Alain Finkielkraut's discussion of crimes against humanity and
the problems of justice in contexts of extreme state violence (5 pages). Both
the summation and all three papers are due in my box in the Department of
History by noon on the day of the class that they are due. Since this is a
relatively intense amount of reading and writing, there will be no final
examination for the course. All grading will be on the +/- scale.

> **_Graduate Students_**

The responsibilities for **graduate students** differ from those of the
undergraduates. Instead of the three analytic papers that the undergraduates
will write, graduate students will be responsible for two short **review
essays (** 10-12 pages). These can correspond to any of the topics that the
graduate students choose. The review essays will consider two additional books
not included on the syllabus. The choice of which topics graduate students
will write about will be made in consultation with me and grad students will
give a brief presentation of the topic they have written about on the day that
the class will discuss that topic. Grad students will additionally be
responsible for the **summation** (3 pages) and for the **in-class** writing
assignments.

**Overview and Objectives**

This course describes and analyzes the history of America's greatest crisis,
from its origins in the early nineteenth century through the abandonment of
Reconstruction in 1877, with some attention to sectional reconciliation and
the various ways in which the crisis is remembered. It interweaves the
political, military, social, economic, and cultural dimensions of this
experience in roughly equal proportions, with emphasis on the linkages between
them.

Students will achieve an understanding of the main developments of the Civil
War and Reconstruction era, the ways in which these developments reflected or
shaped developments in general American history, and the main interpretations
advanced by scholars who have studied this subject. They will also hone their
skills at critical writing and analysis, and will gain greater insight into
the way historians explore the human condition.

A Guide for Undergraduates**

Introduction

History 557.03 is an upper division course taught at an advanced level. It is
also an elective. I therefore assume that students have chosen to take it
because they are interested and motivated to learn the material. I also assume
that students have an appropriate background in American history, which is why
I strongly encourage you to have at least taken History 151 (American
Civilization to 1877) before attempting this course.

The course requires about 150 pages of reading per weekÂ—sometimes more, seldom
less. If you accept this reality at the outset you will be all right. If you
assume you can pick up everything from lecture or from a light skimming of the
texts you will not do well. It's as simple as that. But don't assume that you
can blow off the lectures, either. For one thing, paying attention to the
lectures will help keep you on track, so that you don't overemphasize some
issues while ignoring others. For another, good attendance helps generate a
certain good will between instructor and student, because it more or less
demonstrates that the student is trying. That good will can come in handy if
you fall down on the mid-term and need a little extra help. Finally, there is
almost always a strong positive correlation between good attendance and good
course performance. So while lecture attendance is not required, it is
strongly encouraged.

Office Hours

Similarly, I encourage you to take full advantage of my office hours and those
of the teaching associate. As a practical matter, you may want to visit him in
preference to myself, since he will be grading your examinations.

Quizzes

I administer quizzes weekly in order to test whether students have done the
assigned reading. The quizzes are not announced in advance. They consist of a
few (typically four) multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. The
questions are drawn from the most important arguments and historical
developments discussed in the readings. If you have absorbed the major points
of the assigned reading, you should do well. If not, not.

Examinations

2\. Essay

On Thursday of the quarter's fourth week you will receive a take-home exam
that will require you to write a 5-page essay on one out of three possible
questions. (The exam questions will also be posted on the Web.) The essay
should be typed, double-spaced, free of misspellings or grammatical faults,
and consistent with the guidelines set forth in Strunk and White's Elements of
Style. The essay is due in class the following Tuesday. NO LATE PAPERS WILL BE
ACCEPTED barring a serious emergency. Computer or printer problems do not
constitute an emergency and will not be accepted as a legitimate excuse.

An essay exam is mainly concerned with the student's grasp of the overarching
concepts of the course and how these concepts organize and give meaning to the
historical facts. Students frequently assume that the essay is just another
way for them to demonstrate what they know about the material that has been
presented in class. In fact, an essay principally tests your ability to think
analytically and to explain your analysis on paper. This involves, in turn:

a. an ability to write clearly, so that the reader is not baffled by
misspellings, grammatical faults, run-on sentences, etc.;

b. an ability to articulate a thesis; in other words, to assert a point of
view concerning the question being discussed;

c. an ability to prioritize. What issues are most important in answering the
question? What is the most logical order in which to present them? What
examples most clearly illustrate these critical issues?

d. an ability to avoid the irrelevant: everything you write should relate
directly and explicitly to the question posed;

e. an ability to write an essay that is proportional to the length allowed. If
asked to write a 5-page essay, you must tailor your depth of coverage so that
you cover the whole question in 5 pages, without omitting important points or
overemphasizing one point to the detriment of another.

Review Essay

You will write a 5-page review of ONE book from a list to be distributed in
the second week of the course.

I expect your book review to conform more closely to those found in scholarly
journals than to those in newspapers and general interest magazines. In
newspapers and magazines, the main point of the reviewÂ—besides telling what
the book is aboutÂ—is often to give the reader a sense of the work's style and
dramatic qualities. Academic reviews, on the other hand, have a somewhat
different agenda. Their purpose is fourfold: (1) to explain briefly what the
book is about, (2) to analyze its thesis, (3) to offer a critical assessment
of the book's strengths and weaknesses, and (4) to appraise its historical
value. While this is not intended as a rigid formula, each of these points
should be addressed in the course of your review.

1\. What the Books Are About - Offer the reader a brief overview of the book's
subject matter, but try to encapsulize each work within three or four
paragraphs. Identify the major events and personalities examined, key concepts
employed, etc., but do not summarize the books in detail.

2\. Thesis - What is the author's main argument?

3\. Strengths and Weaknesses - What do you think of the author's thesis? Do
she or he do a good job of proving it? What sources were usedÂ—personal
experience, unpublished government documents, private manuscript collections,
published primary or secondary works? Do you think they addressed all the
relevant issues or can you think of some that they ought to have examined but
did not? What were the author's qualifications for writing such books? Did the
author have a particular ax to grind? Was the writing style clear or difficult
to follow?

4\. Historical Importance - How useful would an interested historian find the
book to be? What makes you think so? Most especially, place the books within
the context of one or more of the main themes and concepts discussed in the
course.

These questions and issues are intended as examples of what your paper should
cover. They are not a checklist. Some may be more relevant to the books you
select than others while you may come up with other questions not mentioned
here.

Your review should be typed, double-spaced, and about four pages in length. It
should be written clearly and free of grammatical errors and misspellings.

On a separate cover sheet, give the review some sort of title and below it,
place your name, the course number, and the date. The book's bibliographical
data should appear at the top of the review: author, title, place of
publication, publisher, date of publication, number of pages. For example:

Gary W. Gallagher, _The Confederate War: How Popular Will, Nationalism, and
Military Strategy Could Not Stave Off Defeat_. Cambridge, Mass., and London:
Harvard University Press, 1997. Pp. viii, 218.

In instances where you quote directly from a work under review, a
parenthetical citation [e.g., (Gallagher, 26)] is appropriate. If other works
are quoted, give the full citation in a footnote [e.g., Gary W. Gallagher,
_The Confederate War: How Popular Will, Nationalism, and Military Strategy
Could Not Stave Off Defeat_. (Cambridge, Mass., and London: Harvard University
Press, 1997), 26.] When in doubt, consult an appropriate reference work. One
of the best is Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses,
and Dissertations_ (5th ed., Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press,
1987). It sells for about $7.95 in paperback and is readily available.

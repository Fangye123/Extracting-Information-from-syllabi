Your course grade will be drawn equally from the results of the four take-home
examinations, none of which will be cumulative.

The quality of your class participation is a factor that is hard to quantify,
but it will also be taken into account in determining course grades,
especially in marginal or exceptional cases.

Attendance is generally expected; punctuality and participation are required.

**HISTORY 499, FALL 1999** **  
SENIOR THESIS**  
The purpose of this course is to familiarize you with the process of
historical research and to help you write the capstone project required of all
history majors. You will be required to write an original thesis of
approximately 25 pages, based on relevant primary and secondary sources. You
are to pick a topic that interests you dealing with some aspect of U.S.
history, 1763-1877. Your final grade will be based _both_ on the quality of
the senior thesis (roughly 80%) and on class attendance and participation
(roughly 20%). Attendance is mandatory, and you are expected to complete all
assignments on time. You should not expect a grade of  "incomplete."  
  
Each of you will have, in addition to the professor, a student referee who
will critique your written work throughout the semester. You, in turn, will be
a referee for one of your colleagues. You must provide a copy of your work for
your referee and for me by 5 p.m. Tuesday evening. I will put a box on the
bookshelf down the hall from my office for this purpose.  
  
Required Texts:  
Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and
Dissertations_  
Richard Marius, _A Short Guide to Writing about History_ , 3d ed.

example, who or what influenced its author(s)? Did other author(s) state
similar ideas? To whom is the document directed? What was the author's purpose
in writing this document?

question #4?

to answer your question.

**_[READING QUESTIONS FOR FINAL
EXAM](http://www.niu.edu/~td0kru1/323/Questions.html)_**  
**__**  **WHAT COUNTS AS SCIENCE?**  
This course is an overview of the history of science from the ancient world
through the 17th century.  In it we examine those areas of knowledge and
technique that most modern people consider to be a part of science, and some
they do not.  A short list includes medicine, astronomy, mathematics,
construction engineering, physics, mining, navigation, hydraulic engineering,
and warfare.  How each of these areas did or did not belong to a scientific
discipline will be a recurring question of the course.

**WHAT DOES SCIENCE HAVE TO DO WITH HISTORY?**  
Until roughly three centuries ago, the collective equivalent of modern
scientists (certified, specialized experts) engaged a much narrower realm of
inquiry than science today encompasses .  Conversely, what we might consider
to be _applied_ sciences (medicine or engineering, for example) usually fell
within the purview of lay people; they had nothing like masters or doctorate
degrees, and were paid primarily for putting their skills to work, not for
expanding or   conveying knowledge.  Lastly, institutional support, so
important to current research and development (think of universities,
institutes, the National Science Foundation), has some famous parallels in the
ancient world (for example, the Alexandria Museum), but was insignificant
overall.

**WHAT DO HISTORIANS DO WITH SCIENCE?**  
So, for those three reasons, the place of science (including all the areas
listed above) in the societies of the past is as much a subject for historians
as for scientists -- and probably more so.  Along with the question of how
specific areas of knowledge or technique related to a scientific discipline,
we will ask continually what relationship they had to ordinary social life.
What forms of science (broadly defined) did particular societies value and
support?  What contributions did scientists make to the maintenance or
improvement of their communities?  Finally, as a component of the General
Education curriculum, our course sets these goals:

  * Strive for clear communication in spoken and written English.  Clarity allows you to demonstrate to others that you can understand and critically analyze a wide variety of  materials (historical documents and literature, modern commentaries and surveys).
  * Demonstrate an understanding of historical development, as well as an ability to apply interpretive skills to the examination of social and cultural values.  Identify and explain cause-&-effect relationships.
  * Be willing to explore the extent and importance of diversity during the period covered by this course in terms of gender, religion, and culture; science -- like behavior, economy, or art --  is shaped by environment.

Additionally, a willingness to read in NIU's Founders Memorial Library from
reserve and reference works, and to use the internet for specific topics, is
**_mandatory_**.   All presentations and writing assignments will require
modest amounts of outside reading.  The  [Class

[Relevant Books & Links](http://www.niu.edu/~td0kru1/bib/techno.html) will
give you a starting point.

**FORMAL REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES:**

  * **(20%)** Participation.  The structure of our classes often will be informal, with a mix of lecture, student presentations, and discussion.  Self-discipline in the form of preparedness, alert and regular attendance, participation, and courtesy toward other students is expected.
  * **(30%)** Two topical reports with a partner, one in the first half (weeks **I-VIII** ) and one in the second half (weeks **IX-XV** ) of the semester.  Each report consists of a joint in-class presentation, no longer than 10 minutes, after which presenters are expected to field or ask questions of the class.  At the time of the presentation, presenters are to turn in a joint written summary that includes a bibliography of works consulted and a very brief summary of their findings (no more than 3 pp). 
  * **(40%)** Total value of three exams, weighted as follows: **EXAM #1** = **10%** ; **EXAM #2** = **15%** ; **EXAM #3** = **15%**.   Make-ups will be allowed only in the case of documented medical emergencies.
  * **(10%) IN-CLASS ESSAY** (with outline).  You will have half of the time allotted for the final exam (i.e. approximately 50 minutes) to write your essay in a large-format "blue book."  The outline may include names and dates, and will be no more than 1 page, 12-point font: this outline _must be approved_ (and possibly edited) by me in class, **Thursday** ( **5/1** ), and will be turned in with the exam.

There is no prerequisite knowledge for this course; I do not assume that you
have had college-level classes in either history or the sciences.  On the
other hand, everyone is warmly invited to bring into the classroom any
relevant knowledge they do have.

**_Note on Cheating & Plagiarism _**All parties involved in a cheating
incident fail that assignment.  Written work that containins any text or ideas
that are not credited and properly cited, or was written by someone other than
the named author,  receives an F. Consult me or the _Undergraduate Catalog_
about any uncertainties.

**_What Has Helped Students in My Classes_**   Keep up on readings and, if you
feel yourself slipping, make yourself see me for a kickstart. Take advantage
of my office hours,  time after class, and email to talk  about readings,
lectures, unanswered questions, or upcoming assignments.  Put another way:
contact is part of my job and your tuition purchase.

>>>>> **Course Description**

>>>>>

>>>>> Welcome to English 201. In reading and writing about literature, we
discover our ability to inhabit others' minds and see through others' eyes.
Every sentence we read maps a nano-second in our culture's inner life. Every
sentence we write inscribes us, however faintly, into that consciousness. The
authors assigned in this course clinically dissect their own moment of
history, and ask us, as readers, to peel open the twentieth century, America's
century, and investigate how words have made us who we are. But what is said
is only half the story. These authors also interrogate how it is said.

>>>>>

>>>>> Words trigger a personal response in each of us and this course
emphasizes our creativity as readers and writers. It is not a search for the
'right' interpretation of Emily Dickinson or Zora Neale Hurston or Don DeLillo
but an investigation of how we, as individuals, create meaning from words. Why
do some lines of poetry never leave us and whole books vanish as if we had
never read them? How do writers use characters, images and voices to shape
their material and reach out to their audience? How do writers slide past our
prejudices, or leave us angry or lonely when we turn the page? Does the writer
provide only the raw materials, and we, the audience create a new story every
time we read?

>>>>>

>>>>> Close reading, a technique that involves the detailed analysis of the
language, tone, structure and ideas of a work, will balance intensive writing
in journals, in formal papers, and on-line to answer these questions. Once
achieved, the skills of the sophisticated reader and imaginative communicator
should not only help you to undertake advanced work in your major but also
equip you for critical thought and action in the world beyond GMU.

>>>>>> Course Requirements**

>>>>>>

>>>>>> [**Papers**](201paper.html)

>>>>>>

>>>>>> You will be asked to write 10 short, one-page papers (350 words
minimum) over the semester, with the first paper due in week three. The paper
should focus intensively on a single question related to each week's reading,
and I shall provide suggestions for paper topics one week in advance. You may
also choose your own subject, and write more than 350 words, if you wish. The
short papers allow you to write as you read, and enable me to offer much more
detailed feedback on your thinking and writing than the three- or four-essay
format.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Each paper should have an introduction, a conclusion and a thesis which
you argue through a logical sequence of paragraphs, and support with relevant
evidence drawn from your readings. Each paper should be typed and double-
spaced, and I do count words. Each writer in the class will be allowed one
late paper: thereafter, I shall deduct one grade for every day the paper is
late. Each paper may also be revised once, if you wish to develop an idea
further or improve your grade.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> [Reading partners](201partner.html)

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Working with a partner also stimulates creativity through the informal
exchange of ideas, opinions and arguments. Each writer in class will be
assigned a reading partner so that my comments are not the only feedback on
your work. When you submit your weekly paper to me, you should also give a
copy to your reading partner. Over the next week, partners should respond to
ideas, structure, and presentation in the paper and return thorough, legible
comments that might help their colleagues revise their papers. You should
think also of discussing readings and assignments together. We may switch
reading partners once during the semester.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> [Research Project](201research.html)

>>>>>>

>>>>>> You will be asked to develop a research project with a partner, and to
create a hypertext presentation of your conclusions suitable for posting on
the class web page at the end of the semester. This format allows each pair to
participate as thinkers and writers in the wider intellectual community beyond
George Mason. Do not worry if you are unfamiliar with the technology or with
the writing of hypertext. I plan to cover the basics in class, and the Media
Authoring Center offers intensive training in creating web pages (especially
if you do not wait until the last four weeks of the semester when every
student assigned a web project is lining up for help). The presentation
constitutes your major research project for the class: each writer should be
prepared to read, write and research imaginatively.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Reading Journal

>>>>>>

>>>>>> The reading journal should constitute your own personal record of your
encounter with the assigned readings and you may write as informally as you
wish. Copy into the journal phrases and sentences you admire or which provoke
ideas or reactions from you. Note down your own interpretations of paragraphs
or sections, your ideas for class discussion or questions you want to raise.
Write as you read: the journal should work as an active part of your reading
process. If you read a section, then try to write the journal entry later, you
may well forget your best ideas. Write one journal entry for each assigned
reading: I again plan to provide study questions to help focus your reading. I
read journals once a week and offer one-to-one feedback on your ideas.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Quizzes

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Ten quizzes. No trick questions. No make-up days.

>>>>>>

>>>>>> Class participation

>>>>>>

>>>>>> This course is a discussion and workshop class. Class participation
thus counts in the final grade. I am looking for evidence that you have
completed and thought about the assigned readings. I am also looking for your
willingness to participate in all class activities, whether full-class
discussions, small-group workshops or the on-line discussion group. Here I
give high marks for effort, not just for the intellectual quality of your
responses.

>>>>>>> **Conferences**

>>>>>>>

>>>>>>> One-to-one conferences are your time: bring a list of questions, a
paper you want to revise or requests for writing or research help. I schedule
some conferences formally but I am also available in the office every week. If
you do not understand an assignment, or are encountering difficulties with the
readings, please do not wait for an official conference time, or try to find a
solution via a quick question before or after class. Drop by during office
hours, make a specific appointment or send me a detailed e-mail. Most of my
enjoyment in this class comes from my encounter with your ides. I look forward
to talking to you.

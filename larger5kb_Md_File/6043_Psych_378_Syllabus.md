####  Prerequisites

Psychology 103 - Introduction to Psychology  
Psychology 215 -  Cognitive Psychology

####  Course Objectives

This class is intended to introduce students to the psychological
understanding of language.  In part, the course will be a survey of
psychological research and theory of language in its different aspects.   We
will also focus on particular issues for more in-depth treatment and
discussion.

Psychology 378 is intended to help you learn about language from a
psychological perspective, an area that examines aspects of meaning,
understanding, communication, speech, and language learning.
Psycholinguistics is part of the field of study called cognitive science, the
science of the mind that draws upon computer science, neuroscience and
philosophy as well as psychology and linguistics, and we will explore some of
these links.

In this semester¨ªs class we will examine the empirical findings and
theoretical models psycholinguistics.  Class work and assignments are intended
to help develop the reading, writing and analytic skills necessary for a
better understanding of the area.  We will spend class time in analysis of the
topics covered in the readings.

####  Course Requirements

**_Exams.  _** There will be 3 regular exams of equal length, and the final.
The final will be comprehensive covering all the topics studied.  Exams will
consist of short answer  and discussion questions.  Each regular exam is
worth 50 points and the final exam is worth 100 points.  
**_Assignments & participation. _** There will be four written assignments of
10 points each (roughly one page in length).  An additional 10 points can be
earned through active class participation and regular attendance.  
**_Paper & presentation._**  Each student will write a paper on a topic
approved by the instructor.  Papers may be reviews of the literature on a
topic, an account of a study carried out by the student,  or a theoretical
analysis of the topic.  Papers should be about 10 pages long and will be due
on the scheduled final exam date for the class. Students will make a brief (10
minutes) presentation to the class on their paper topic.  The presentation
will count for 10% of the grade for the paper, and the paper is worth 100
points.

**_Grading_**  
There is no grade curve.  There are 400 total points available and grades will
be assigned as shown below:  
  Grade | A  | B+ | B | C+ | C  | D  | F

####  Attendance policy

Class attendance is expected.  Students are responsible for all content and
assignments for each class.  If, for serious personal or medical reasons,
several classes are missed, please inform me of the reason.  A student may be
dropped from the class for excessive absence (that is, 15% or more of the
scheduled classes).

####  Makeup policy

I will only give a makeup exam for an excused absence;  this means that you
provide me with a written excuse from the Undergraduate Dean¨ªs Office.  The
makeup will be scheduled as soon as possible after the missed exam.

The Honor Code of the College of Charleston specifically forbids cheating,
attempted cheating, and plagiarism.  A student found guilty of these offenses
will receive a failing grade in the course.  Additional penalties may include
suspension or expulsion from the College at the discretion of the Honor Board.
See the College of Charleston Student Handbook for definitions of these

####  Open Door Policy

I encourage you to make use of office hours, or to make appointments if you
need to talk further outside class. I am usually in my office at other times
too, and available to talk to students. If my office door is open, then you
are welcome to stop by, ask questions, or just chat. If my office door is
closed, then either I am not there, or I am doing something that I don¨ªt want
interrupted. You will find that if I am in my office, then my door is almost
always open, so please drop by!

Course Description: |  
Introduction to the nature and scope of government information issued by the
Federal government as well as by the state, municipal and international
governments. Bibliographic control, acquisition, organization, maintenance,
and their reference use. Problem oriented approach. (UCLA General Catalog)  
_Course Objectives_ :  
1) To present a government information paradigm which will:  
A) define the scope of the government information specialist's concern; and  
B) explain the specialist's clarification and classification procedures for
answering government information questions;  
2) To describe the various formats (including paper, near print, microformats,
CD-ROM, and online sources, especially the World Wide Web) of government
information and their value to users of libraries and information centers;  
3) To examine the acquisition, organization, and administration of these
various formats;  
4) To develop basic skill in the procedural techniques of manual and
electronic bibliographic and literature searching appropriate to government
information;  
5) To demonstrate the ability to construct useful WWW pages or a research
oriented approach to government information; and finally,  
6) To foster a knowledge-based, problem-solving approach to government
information questions asked in library and information centers.  
Course Requirements:  
In order to accomplish these objectives, the following requirements are
necessary:  
1) attendance at lectures and field trips as well as handing in all
assignments on time. See class schedule for dates. Do the assigned and/or
optional readings to supplement lectures, to fill in details, and to pursue
areas of special interest to you. Study any handouts which are intended to
clarify complex relationships.  
2) Satisfactorily complete three exercises related to government information:
a) a US GPO [bookstore](bookstore.htm) paper; b) [a bill tracing
exercise](BILTRACE.htm); and c) answering a set of [reference
questions](refquestions.htm). You may work in groups (up to three) on each
these exercises.  
3) Complete a major project: either A) a publishable, research paper or B)
build a Webpage for a federal government cabinet level agency citing
government information resources. Again, you may work in a group of up to
three people of either A or B.  
Grading Criteria:  
  
For all papers, my evaluation will include: 1) appearance (e.g., conformance
to a particular journal's house style); 2) bibliographic style (remember to
use one of the government information journals' house style); and 3) clarity
of presentation. Webpages will be grading according to Rettig's
[criteria](http://www.onlineinc.com/onlinemag/SeptOL/rettig9.html).

Plagiarism will be reported to the Dean of Students and a DR grade assigned
pending final resolution.  
  
Grading Weights:  
Three Exercises (5% for US GPO paper; 25% for the bill tracing and 20% for the
reference questions), Research Paper or Government Agency Webpage (50%); a
total of four different assignments for 100% of grade.  
  
Due Dates and Penalties:  
See the class schedule below for due dates (right hand column).  
Late papers will be penalized substantially (i.e., a half letter grade per
session).

"Government documents are stiff, graceless things, scarcely the happiest
subject for spirited discourse among polite people." \--J. H. Powell  
"There exist no sources of historical information in a free and enlightened
country, so rich and so valuable, as its publick journals, and the debates of
its publick bodies and associations." \--Peter Force  
"...no modern library can give adequate reference service without access to
the publications of the U.S. Government." \--Boyd and Rips  
"A popular government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring
it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps, both. Knowledge
will forever govern ignorance; and a people who mean to be their own Governors
must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives." \--James Madison  
"We are getting 'documents to the libraries' but the slogan of GODORT is
'Documents to the People.'" \--Ronald P. Haselhuhn

**Description  
**

**The Vietnam War is one of the most important events of the twentieth
century, especially for the people of the United States and the people of
Vietnam. It affects powerfully the politics, culture and history of these two
nations. Understanding this war, especially for a generation that has no
memory of it, requires an examination of a wide variety of topics. The Vietnam
War has a lengthy historical background; it involves the intersection and
clash of Western and Asian cultures; it is defined by intense political
choices and conflicts; and its nature for the participants can only be grasped
through very personal and experiential media. Consequently, any course about
the Vietnam War should draw upon a diverse set of disciplines and
approaches.**

**This course is developed around a multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary
perspective on the Vietnam War. At any single campus, several faculty may have
the interest and expertise to provide such a approach; but this range of
capabilities is more likely found on several campuses. Until recently,
bringing together the faculty resources of several colleges for a course such
as this required prohibitively large travel and time costs. Information
technology now permits this inter-campus collaboration at a fraction of the
former cost and makes possible a much more complex course on the Vietnam
War.**

**We will use information technology to expand the arc of expertise,
interaction, and collaboration among students and faculty so as to better
understand the Vietnam War. This will occur through delivery online of
learning materials from three faculty at three institutions: lecture notes,
questions, specialized links, and interactive, multimedia learning modules.
Students at three institutions will experience a common course with
specialized sections from local campuses and will interact with each other in
posing and answering questions, clarifying issues, and expressing opinions and
judgments. Faculty from each institution will interact with students at each
institution in similar fashion; and faculty will interact with faculty in a
team-teaching context to challenge each other and students to push their
understanding and analysis of the Vietnam much farther.**

**Expectations:**

> **My expectations are simple: come to every class prepared to discuss and
analyze the material. You need to come to class on time. Each class missed
beyond three will result in a one-twelfth penalty to your final grade. You
must complete the assigned work on time. No late papers will be accepted.**

>

> **Because this is an experimental course, I hope you will approach it with
some flexibility and willingness to deal with the inevitable frustrations.
Your efforts to help make it work will be essential.**

**October 5 Paper Due:**

**You are to write a five - seven page paper describing the role you have
played in the simulation just completed. Describe the person/nation you
portrayed and the policies and proposals you made. Explain why you took those
positions, including how the documents and other materials led you to make
these proposals. (Be sure to cite the sources.) How were these ideas received
by the other members of your team and by other teams in the simulation? What
is your take on whether some outcome other that what actually happened was
possible in 1965? Explain your conclusion. What actually happened in the
simulation? How is that different from what actually happened? Why did those
differences occur?**

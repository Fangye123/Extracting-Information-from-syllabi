I. COURSE OBJECTIVES.**

The unfolding of social and natural events in the present context of regional
and global economic market development and integration affects the decisions
of management executives in virtually every business organization and the
ensuing viability of competing organizations and state economies to sustain
the impacts of unanticipated transformations in their environments.
Consequently, an increasing number of business organizations are conducting
commercial transactions on a regular basis with suppliers and clients in
foreign nations in order to maintain their viability and competitive
advantage. This trend towards greater levels of international commerce among
business organizations presents great demands and opportunities for
individuals who have the necessary technical expertise and interpersonal
skills required to manage international business organizations effectively.
The central mission of this graduate level course on international business
management is to provide relevant theoretical and practical insights so that
the real world of global business is better understood by students who aspire
to develop successful careers in international business management.

The specific objectives of the course and the learning outcomes which students
are expected to achieve in order to satisfy the requirements for this course
include:  

  1. Discern historical patterns and developments in the management of international trade and the advances in the generation and application of literary knowledge related to international business management.
  2. Develop a clear understanding of the conceptual frameworks and definitions of specific terms that are integral to the international management literature.   

  3. Attain a clear understanding of the various factors that help determine the appropriateness of different management strategies for different types of international ventures.  

  4. Examine ethical issues that are pertinent to international business management practices and to the personal value system of the student.  

  5. Explore and evaluate international management opportunities in regional locations and organizations where students may seek to pursue international business ventures or management career.

II. REQUIRED TEXTBOOKS.**

  * Holt, David H. and Wigginton, Kare W. (2002). International Management, 2nd Edition. Ft.Worth, TX: Harcourt College Publishers. 

(Other readings may be assigned by the instructor prior to some of the
scheduled session topics.)  

**  
III.COURSE ACTIVITIES.**

The course will consist of reading assignments, lectures, written reports,
video recordings, case studies, class discussions, and exams focusing on the
reading assignments, case exercises and lectures.  
Students are expected to perform with graduate-level competence the mental
operations on which the mastering of material in international business
management depends. These operations include:

  1. Knowledge: Demonstrating basic factual awareness of major ideas and course material.  

  2. Comprehension: Understanding meanings of written materials, including key ideas, issues and assumptions that are implied but not stated explicitly, i.e., "understanding the content, integrating it with previous material, and reading between the lines."  

  3. Analysis: Examining and comparing the parts of organizational systems, such as major causal links, direct and indirect effects, structural patterns, key processes, critical subsystems, and the inter-relatedness of these factors to each other..  

  4. Evaluation: Making judgments about system performance according to multiple criteria.  

  5. Application: Applying the knowledge gained from the lectures, readings, and previous experience to new situations..  
  

**IV.GRADING.**

Student grades for this course will be determined as follows:

  1. Midterm exam ..................................... 25%
  2. Collaborative case study reports........... 25%  

  3. Integrative case analysis........................ 25%  

  4. Final exam............................................ 25%  

  1. There will be a midterm exam focusing on material covered in the lectures, required readings, and class discussions. The midterm exam will consist of multiple-choice questions and short essay questions. The midterm exam will determine twenty-five percent of a student's final course grade.  
  

  2. The course grade is also based on collaborative projects in which students self-select into dyads in order to review and apply the central concepts covered in the reading assignments to one of the corresponding cases suggested for that particular session. Each student group is expected to prepare an oral report summarizing the case to the class and to lead the discussion of the selected case and its relevance to the session topic. Each student is expected to participate in at least two collaborative case projects. For each one of the collaborative case projects, each student is expected to submit a typed summary of the case analysis and its relevance to the corresponding course topics. These individual summary reports should not exceed a five-page limit. A student's performance on this project will determine 25% of the final grade for the course.  
  

  3. An integrative case analysis which applies pertinent course concepts and theories to illustrate important course issues in an organization that the student has been studying throughout the term will be due at the end of the quarter. This case analysis should be typed and double-spaced and approximately fifteen pages in length. This research report will determine 25% of a student's final grade for the course.

  4. There will also be a final exam focusing on material covered in the lectures, required readings, and class discussions. The final exam will consist of multiple-choice questions and short essay questions. The final exam will determine twenty-five percent of a student's final course grade.

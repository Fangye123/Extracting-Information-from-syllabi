## History 121B: Title - Making of the Modern World, 1750-1950

Quarter: Spring 2000  
Instructor: Edmund Burke, III

This course is the second in a two-quarter sequence on the history of the
world and its interactions with the West. It explores the origins of the
modern world from a new perspective. It is an ideal course for history majors
and others looking for a chance to integrate their understanding of modern
world history. Beginners can also learn much. (See below for more on this
course).

The aim is to encourage the student to develop a sense of the patterns of
modern history. Nonetheless, since a basic factual and geographical knowledge
is imperative, there will be weekly quizzes on terms and geographical places
drawn from lists to be handed out.

Topics include: revolutions in the Americas (the U.S., Haiti, Latin America),
slavery & abolition in the Atlantic world; race and class in South Africa and
the Old South; self-strengthening in Turkey and Japan, progress and cultural
conflict in Mexico; the culture of colonialism, the environment and modern
history; nationalisms in India, Turkey and China; the Cold War and the Third
world; economic globalization and the future of history.

Here's some thoughts on my approach: By 1750, Europe was on the verge of
global hegemony as a result of far-reaching changes deriving from the
industrial and democratic revolutions. The 19th and 20th centuries witnessed
the export of this dual revolution to the rest of the world. One result,
despite continual resistance, was the establishment of an international
division of labor and the incorporation of most world societies into the world
economy. A second result was the division of the globe by the chief European
states into spheres of influence, and formal and informal empires, and the
unprecedented expansion of white settlement in the Americas, Southern Africa,
and Australia. How this occurred, and to what effect, forms the subject matter
of this course.

Two concepts, nationalism and imperialism, will provide us with a way of
discussing the interaction of the world and the West during the past two
centuries. What is imperialism? What was its impact upon the old societies of
Asia and Africa? What is nationalism? How did world societies seek to resist
Western domination, and how were they eventually able to achieve independence?



### REQUIRED WRITTEN WORK

Two short papers, a midterm and choice of either a final exam or a term paper
on an approved topic. (Term papers must go through two drafts.)



### REQUIRED READING

The following required books have been ordered by the Bay Tree Bookstore. All
are in paperback. There will also be a Required Course Reader.

1\. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities (Verso)

2\. Eric Foner, Nothing But Freedom (Louisiana State University Press)

3\. George Frederickson, White Supremacy (Oxford)

4\. Kenneth Pyle, The Making of Modern Japan 2nd edition. (D.C. Heath)

5\. Alfred Crosby, Ecological Imperialism (Cambridge)

6\. Rabindranath Tagore, The Home and the World



At this writing (February 2, 2000) I have not decided if I'll use a textbook.
If I do, it will probably be: Peter Stearns, et al., World Civilizations, Vol.
2. (Harper-Collins).

History 150C - Twentieth-Century China

Gail Hershatter  
TA: Wenqing Kang  
MWF 8-9:10 AM  
Social Sciences 2 Room 179

This course will explore the history of China in the twentieth century,
focusing on the end of imperial rule, the sources and development of
revolution, attempts at socialist transformation, and the course and
consequences of economic reform. We will draw upon novels, short stories, and
films as well as translations of original documents.

The following books have been ordered at the Bay Tree Bookstore:

Spence, _Search for Modern China_  
Cheng and Lestz, _Search for Modern China: A Documentary Collection_  
Chen Yuan-tsung, _Dragon's Village_  
Yang, _Spider Eaters_  
Dutton, _Streetlife China_

We will be reading all these books except Spence's Search and Cheng and
Lestz's companion volume in their entirety. (These two books, however, are the
basic texts for the course.) Although backup copies are on reserve in the
library, it is strongly recommended that you purchase all the books. In
addition, a reader will be sold in conjunction with the course.

We will meet three times a week for a combination of lectures and discussion.
Weekly discussion sections are also required. Course requirements include:

**Mindful reading and wakeful attendance**. Complete the assigned readings
before each class session, and come prepared to share your opinions,
observations, and questions. Class sessions will be devoted to contextualizing
as well as analyzing the required readings. We will cover material in class
that enhances but does not duplicate the course reading; therefore attendance
and selective (not compulsive) note-taking are essential.

**Writing**. You will be asked to write weekly one-page reading responses and
two five-page essays on assigned topics, drawing upon the course readings. You
will also complete a map quiz, a midterm, and a final.

**Talking**. Most class sessions will be divided between lecture and
discussion, while sections will be devoted entirely to student debate and
discussion. Prepare to question, opine, and defend!

You can obtain more information about the course by contacting the instructor
at 9-4041 or by email at [gbhers@cats.ucsc.edu](mailto:gbhers@cats.ucsc.edu).

History 216A - Topics in American History: U.S. Working Class History

Instructor: David Brundage, Associate Professor.  
Email: [brundage@cats](mailto:brundage@cats.ucsc.edu)

The course is geared mainly to the needs of Americanists in the history
graduate program, but it is  
open to graduate students in other areas and disciplines as well.

The goal of this seminar is to provide graduate students with an introduction
to some of the key issues and debates in the field of American working-class
history and to give them a sense of where the field is heading. We'll begin
with some readings on E.P. Thompson and the "new labor history" in the U.S.
and with a look at some of the main critics of this approach. We'll come back
to these larger debates throughout the course as we examine the following
topics: emancipation and the emergence of wage labor after the Civil War;
immigrant cultures and proletarianization in the late 19th-early 20th
centuries; the character of the labor movement in the late 19th century; work
cultures, workers control and scientific management in the early 20th century;
the evolution of labor law and the state's role in shaping class relations in
the 20th century; gender and community as ways of understanding the emergence
of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in the 1930s; and black-white
relations in the CIO and in the post-war era.

Writing will include short weekly papers responding to the readings
(essentially annotations); and a paper at the end (15-20 pages), analyzing the
literature on a topic of the student's choice.

New Business  
  
B.2. The committee discussed the proposal to revise the Minor in Business
Spanish to include a business students' option. This option had been
disapproved by the APCC at an earlier meeting. It was true to the spirit of
the option that the C&CC had approved originally, and a motion to approve it
once again was made, seconded, and passed unanimously (attached).  
  
B.3. The committee then discussed a proposal for Honors in the Spanish Major.
Concern was expressed that students would not understand the requirement of an
"above average score on the proficiency exam." The proposal was approved
unanimously contingent on clarification of that score (attached with
clarifying language).  
**The committee returned to the order of the agenda.**

    2. W-I Review Process \-- The committee discussed a memorandum from Associate Dean Charles Schuster (former director of the Edison Initiative) in which he informed the committee that the W-I review process was at a standstill due to the inability to secure a quorum for meetings of the Steering and Oversight Committees. A proposal for a modified review process was presented. It was moved and seconded to approve the proposed process. Two amendments were moved, seconded, and approved unanimously:  

      * to add to the committee one L&S student who has completed a writing-intensive or Freshman Seminar course  

      * to amend the faculty membership to read "six faculty members (two each from the Humanities, Natural Science, and Social Sciences) who have taught writing-intensive or Freshman Seminar courses, appointed to staggered three-year terms by the L&S Course and Curriculum Committee  
The motion was approved unanimously as amended (attached).  
  

    3. The following course was approved for addition to the Seminar list:

    4. Discussion Item: Guidelines for Internships  
  
The committee reviewed drafts of guidelines, procedures, application, and
evaluation forms for internships, and discussed the need for these items for
departments that have not developed their own set of documents. Committee
members wish to continue the discussion at a future meeting, and they asked
Cindy to invite internship coordinators for Communication and English to
attend the next C&CC meeting.  
  
**The committee returned to the order of the agenda, but agreed to address
first those items that were the most pressing. Items skipped will be added to
the agenda of the next meeting as Old Business.**  
  
  

    5. Spring Meeting Schedule -- The committee approved the remainder of its meetings dates for the Spring: (Mar 11, Apr 1, Apr 22, and, if needed, May 13).  
  

  4. Old Business

**RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE  
FOR REVISION OF THE MINOR IN BUSINESS SPANISH**  
  

**

  1. Current Requirements for the Minor Program in Business Spanish  
(Not open to students in the School of Business Administration)  
( _Bulletin_ excerpt)**  
  
The minor in Business Spanish requires the completion, with a GPA of 2.5 or
above, of 18 credits, at least 9 of which must be at the 300 level or above
taken in residence at UWM, including the following:  
  
Bus Ad 100 | Introduction to Business | 3 cr  
---|---|---  
Bus Ad 330   | Organizations | 3 cr  
Spanish 332   | Business and Legal Spanish I | 3 cr  
Spanish 342 | Business and Legal Spanish II | 3 cr  
  
One of the following:  
Spanish 361   | Spanish Culture* | 3 cr  
---|---|---  
Spanish 363 | Spanish-American Culture* | 3 cr  
Spanish 365 | Topics in Hispanic Culture* | 3 cr  
  | (*these courses satisfy the GER distribution requirement) |  
  
Three credits in the following:  
Spanish 312   | Independent Writing | 1-3 cr  
---|---|---  
Spanish 347 | Introduction to Translation | 3 cr  
Spanish 361, 363, or 365 | if not selected above | 3 cr  
  
  
With the approval of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, instead of a
culture course students may take a course in anthropology, geography, history,
political science, or sociology that focuses on the Hispanic world. Students
are urged to take two culture courses as well as both the writing and
translation courses.  
  
An internship with a firm doing business in Latin America or Spain may
substitute for one of the required courses in the minor. Such substitutions
must be approved by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese in consultation
with the School of Business Administration which will assist students in
finding an internship.  
  
After completing all course work for the minor in Business Spanish, students
may opt to take an exam prepared by the Madrid Chamber of Commerce to test
foreign student levels of proficiency in Business Spanish. Students who pass
the exam are certified as having completed training in Business Spanish. There
is a modest fee for taking the exam.  
  
**

  2. Summary of the Proposed Change(s)**  
  

    1. Define the existing Business Spanish Minor as the "Non-Business Students Track."  

    2. Add a new "Business Students Track."  
  
**

  3. Justification for the Proposed Change(s)**  
  
The original proposal for a Business Spanish Minor contained a provision for
Business Administration students to substitute courses for the required
Business Administration courses. The proposal was not approved as submitted.
APCC members felt that Business students should not be allowed to count
Business courses taken as part of their Business programs toward completion of
this minor. The non-Business student track was approved. The Department was
encouraged to resubmit the proposal with a more rigorous option for Business
students. This proposal represents that reworked option.  
  
**

  4. Proposed Requirements for the Minor Program in Business Spanish**  
**( _Bulletin_ excerpt)**  
  
The minor in Business Spanish requires the completion, with a GPA of 2.5 or
above, of 18 credits, at least 9 of which must be at the 300 level or above
taken in residence at UWM. Students in the Business School must complete the
requirements in the Business Students Track. All other students complete the
Non-Business Students Track. Students are responsible for completing any
prerequisite course as well.

Spanish 312 | Independent Writing | 1-3 cr  
---|---|---  
Spanish 347 | Introduction to Translation | 3 cr  
Spanish 361, 363, or 365, | if not selected above | 3 cr  
  
With the approval of the Department of Spanish and Portuguese, instead of a
culture course students may take a course in anthropology, geography, history,
political science, or sociology that focuses on the Hispanic world. Students
are urged to take two culture courses as well as both the writing and
translation courses.  
  
An internship with a firm doing business in Latin America or Spain may
substitute for one of the required courses in the minor. Such substitutions
must be approved by the Department of Spanish and Portuguese in consultation
with the School of Business Administration which will assist students in
finding an internship.  
  
After completing all course work for the minor in Business Spanish, students
may opt to take an exam prepared by the Madrid Chamber of Commerce to test
foreign student levels of proficiency in Business Spanish. Students who pass
the exam are certified as having completed training in Business Spanish. There
is a modest fee for taking the exam.

  5. Recommendation for Action**  
  
That the amended Business Spanish Minor be approved effective Semester I,
1999-2000.  
  
Return to the Minutes  

  
  
  
  
**RECOMMENDATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SPANISH AND PORTUGUESE  
TO ESTABLISH HONORS IN THE SPANISH MAJOR**  
  
**Recommendation**  
  
That, effective Fall, 1999-2000, the Faculty of the College of Letters and
Science approved the establishment of Honors in the Major for the Spanish
Major with the following parameters:  
  

Students major in Spanish whose performance in the department proficiency exam
is above average ( "high intermediate") may apply to enter the Spanish "Honors
in the Major" program. Students will be awarded Honors in the Major upon
graduation if they do the following:  

  

  1. maintain at least a 3.5 GPA in all credits that count toward the major;  
  

  2. write, for an advanced course, a paper between 40 and 50 pages long in Spanish or in English on an original topic that has been well researched. The course instructor and another member of the teaching staff chosen by the Department's undergraduate advisor will evaluate the paper. The student will present the paper in Spanish at a public forum.  

  
**Rationale**  
  
A number of departments in the College of Letters and Science offer honors in
the major. This option provides a means of both challenging and recognizing
highly motivated, talented students who major in Spanish. The specific
requirements are in line with the requirements of other such programs.  
  
  
**Approved:**

**PROPOSAL FROM THE EDISON INITIATIVE STAFF TO THE  
L&S COURSE AND CURRICULUM COMMITTEE TO  
RESTRUCTURE THE W-I REVIEW PROCESS**  
  
**Proposal**  
  
That the L &S Course and Curriculum Committee rescind its prior action
creating a WIC oversight committee and a WIC steering committee;  
  
That the Committee create a W-I Subcommittee of the L&S Course and Curriculum
Committee composed of the following membership:  

  * One member of the L&S C&CC who will serve as chair;  

  * six faculty members (two each from the Humanities, Natural Sciences, and Social Sciences) who have taught writing-intensive or Freshman Seminar courses, appointed to staggered three-year terms by the L&S C&CC;  

  * one L&S student who has completed a writing-intensive or Freshman Seminar course;  

  * the Coordinator of English Composition ( _ex officio_ and non-voting);  

  * one L&S advisor, appointed by the Dean ( _ex officio_ and non-voting);  

  * one representative of the Dean's Office ( _ex officio_ and non-voting).  

  
That the W-I Subcommittee be assigned the following responsibilities:  

  * conduct an annual review of the W-I program and requirements;  

  * create and carry out the W-I review process;  

  * forward to the Course and Curriculum Committee recommendations for W-I status for appropriate courses.  

  
That this recommendation, if approved by the L&S C&CC, become effective
immediately upon receiving approval of the Dean of the College.  
  
**Rationale**  
  
The dual committee structure approved for the review of writing-intensive
courses has proved to be too unwieldy for the work of the committee(s) to be
accomplished in a reasonable time frame. Getting a quorum for the large
Oversight Committee has not been possible for some time. A smaller W-I
Subcommittee will be able to achieve a quorum. The proposed size of the W-I
Subcommittee is sufficiently large to enable timely revives of W-I proposals.
Because there are a number of W-I proposals pending, immediate action on this
proposal is needed.

  2. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION**  
  
_Introductory Statement Outlining the Objectives_  
  
Few would disagree that citizens, businesses, and governments at all levels
increasingly are affected by globalization of the economic, cultural, social,
political, and communication arenas within which we operate on a daily basis.
The case for institutions of higher education assuming a critical role in the
preparation of individuals who are able to function with ease in this
environment has been made elsewhere. With this broad goal as its focus, the
Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies degree program was developed around the
following objectives:  
  
X     | to provide writing, communication, analytical, and critical thinking
skills needed in a complex global environment;  
---|---  
X | to ensure acquisition of competency in a foreign language beyond the mini-
mal level of proficiency normally required in international studies majors;  
X | to transmit an understanding of the broad global environment;  
X | to provide in-depth comprehension of the culture of a particular country
or region of interest to the student;  
X | to provide first-hand exposure to the culture of interest through
mandatory study abroad; and  
X | to enable the study of a disciplinary focus with direct practical
applicability in the business and professional world.  
  
_Preparatory Curriculum_  
  
The preparatory curriculum is designed to provide a broad base in the liberal
arts and sciences in order to assist students in developing the writing,
communication, analytical, and critical thinking skills that they will need in
any internationally-oriented career. In addition, it provides a solid
foundation in international studies and related disciplines to help students
identify more focused areas of interest in the international arena. The
following requirements must be completed:  
  
X     | the English Writing Requirement of the L&S BA/BS degree;  
---|---  
X | the Math and Formal Reasoning Requirement of the L&S BA/BS degree (note:
Econ 210--see below--counts toward this requirement);  
X | the Seminar Requirement of the L&S BA/BS degree;  
X | the University's General Education Requirements;  
X | a single foreign language through the fourth semester AND Course 213
Grammar for Students of Foreign Languages, taken in the same language
curricular area;  
X | IntlSt 101, Intro to Comparative or Cross-Cultural Analysis: (Subtitle) (3
cr) or IntlSt 193, Freshman Seminar: (comparative or cross-cultural analysis
topic) (3 cr) [appropriate courses in other departments under development];  
X | Econ 103/104, Micro/Macroeconomics (6 cr), and either Econ 210, Econ
Statistics (3 cr), or Bus Ad 210, Intro to Management Statistics (3 cr);  
X | Pol Sci 106, Nations of the World (3 cr), Pol Sci 175, Intro to
International Relations (3 cr), or Sociol 103, World Society (3 cr)

Communication (3 cr)  
X | Bus Ad 100, Introduction to Business (3 cr);  
X | IntlSt 260, Introduction to International Careers (2 cr).  
  
It is assumed that students entering the University will possess basic
computer literacy. If not, they are advised to take an introductory course (at
least 2 cr) in computer literacy skills.  
  
To be admitted formally to the BAGS program, students must earn a 2.50 or
better gpa in the following preparatory courses: Bus Ad 100; Commun 101, 103,
or 105; Econ 102, 104, and 210; Intl St 101 or 193; [Language] 213; and Pol
Sci 106 or 175 or Sociol 103.  
  
_Core Courses_ (common to all tracks) - 27 credits  
  
The core courses serve to equip students with knowledge and skills more
directly focused in areas that are essential underpinnings of international
studies. The following requirements must be completed:  
  
X | Bus Ad 330, Organizations (3 cr);  
---|---  
X | Commun 350, Intercultural Communication (3 cr);  
X | Econ 396, International Economic Relations (3 cr);  
X | three courses, at least 3 cr each, numbered above the 213-level in a
single foreign language (9 cr);  
X | two courses at the 300-level or above in the anthropology, culture,
geography, history, politics, or sociology of a single foreign county or area
of the world (6 cr);  
X     | one course (at least 3 cr) at the 300-level or above in comparative or
cross-regional analysis.  
  
_Emphasis_ (various tracks)  
  
The emphasis area permits students to direct their studies toward a particular
disciplinary area in which they have a focused interest. The emphasis area
provides access to knowledge and skills that relate directly to a business
and/or professional career area. Students must:  
  
X     | select an emphasis area with a core of at least 5 courses (at least 15
credits) and  
---|---  
X | select two or more courses, at least 6 credits, from approved
international electives related to the emphasis area.

  3. RATIONALE**  
  
In fall of 1997, the Governor announced a new international education
initiative aimed at ensuring  "that young people throughout Wisconsin are
properly trained and prepared to become the first truly global generation."
This announcement stimulated the examination of activities supporting
international education on a variety of different fronts. Despite the
existence of international studies majors at a number of institutions of
higher education in Wisconsin, businesses indicate they are unable to find
employees who are sophisticated enough in the language and culture of many of
the foreign countries in which they aim to conduct business. Most
international studies programs require a minimal level of language competency,
and students can earn their degrees without spending any time in another
country. For Wisconsin to remain competitive economically, to retain its
position as a leader in education in a global environment, and to provide a
pool of professionals with the competencies needed for the twenty-first
century, it is essential to strengthen international and foreign language
education at all levels.  
  
In response to the Governor's charge, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
proposes the development of a new Bachelor of Arts in Global Studies. Through
its strong liberal arts preparatory curriculum, this degree program focuses on
the development of the communication and critical analysis skills that allow
students to respond and adapt easily in a rapidly changing world. It
strengthens the understanding of and ability to relate appropriately to people
from other countries and cultures through area-specific core courses in
anthropology, culture, history, and politics as well as a mandatory study
abroad experience. And it offers education directed toward the acquisition of
knowledge and expertise in areas directly applicable to the business and
professional world through internationally oriented core courses, various
areas of emphasis, and a required international internship. While the emphases
in the program are rooted in specific disciplines, the entire program
curriculum is multidisciplinary, linking intellectual perspectives from many
fields and bringing them to bear on international issues.  
  
  
**

  4. CONTEXT**  
  
4.1 History of Program:  
  
The origins of the proposed BA in Global Studies are to be found in the
expansion of international studies teaching and research following the
establishment of UWM's Title VI Center for International Studies in 1991. With
funding from the U.S. Department of Education, the Center strengthened the L
&S interdisciplinary Major in International Studies, made grants for
curriculum development to dozens of faculty members from various schools and
colleges, provided leadership for the reform and enhancement of foreign
language instruction, and contributed to the expansion of study abroad and
affiliations with overseas universities. US/ED and other grants received by
the Center, all earned in peer review competition, thus far have brought about
$2.5 million to UWM.  
  
A new phase was begun in 1996-97 when the Dean of the College of Letters and
Science (L&S) initiated an "Internationalization Across the College" program.
Prominent among the accomplishments of this initiative was a new structure for
the administration of foreign language teaching and new requirements,
including an international studies requirement, for the L&S degree. Equally
important, if not more so, the Dean appointed a committee on
internationalization that produced a comprehensive report and made numerous
recommendations, many of which currently are being implemented. A number of
grant proposals were written and submitted in an effort to increase resources
for this initiative. Although not all were successful, this effort did produce
significant funding for several new international programs.  
  
In 1997-98, the School of Business Administration (SBA) became a partner in
this internationalization effort. During the past year, L&S and SBA have
worked together on many projects relating to international studies. They
include joint projects relating to teaching, research, and community outreach.
They also include the design of UW's Institute for Global Studies (IGS), which
provides an administrative framework for the future expansion of international
studies and programs, both within each school/college and for collaborative
projects, including the proposed BA in Global Studies. Partial support for
some IGS projects, including some pertaining to the BA in Global Studies, is
being provided by a grant from the UW-System Central Investment Fund.  
  
4.2 Instructional Setting of Program:  
  
The BA in Global Studies will be housed in the Center for International
Studies and will be administered jointly by the College of Letters and Science
(L&S) and the School of Business Administration (SBA). Course work is drawn
from existing courses in L&S departments and in the SBA. It is anticipated
that some new cooperative courses also will be developed. Nine academic units
have prepared program emphases, and others are anticipated for the future.  
  
4.3 Relation to Mission Statement and Institutional Academic Planning  
  

> "Our education system, from K-12 through graduate schools, is not currently
organized to produce citizens and business leaders equipped to succeed in a
global economy ... Though some schools provide some elements of international
business education, we need a post-secondary system capable of providing
practical international business training ... Wisconsin business leaders need
our ... colleges and universities to prepare graduates for executive
leadership in international business development ... Unhappily, there is no
coherent statewide strategy guiding the development of these efforts, and no
mechanism currently exists for making resources accessible to the business
community." \- _Report of Governor Thompson's Wisconsin Export Strategy
Commission, 1994_

  
Echoing this report, Wisconsin business leaders have continued to voice
frustration over the lack of international educational programming and
services to meet their many urgent needs in our rapidly changing global
economy. The UW System Survey of Wisconsin Businesses, conducted in 1995,
documented these needs among businesses statewide and in Southeast Milwaukee,
in particular. The Strategic Plan for Business Education in the UW System,
adopted by the Board of Regents in 1996, calls for the development of high
quality international programs and services to serve Wisconsin businesses.
Wisconsin International Trade Council (WITCO) was asked by the Governor to
make further recommendations in this regard.  
  
Through a unique collaborative approach, the proposed BA in Global Studies
will offer the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee an opportunity to utilize the
advantages of its intellectual resources, urban setting, and strategic
alliances with the Wisconsin business community to address these challenges.  
  
The mission of BA in Global Studies is to enable the University of Wisconsin-
Milwaukee to respond in dynamic and innovative ways to the international
educational needs of its students. The proposed BA in Global Studies will
strengthen ties to and support the Wisconsin business and professional
communities through the program's internship requirement and by graduating
students who are qualified to work and live in a global world.  
  
4.4 Institutional Enrollment Management:  
  
This program is expected to attract Wisconsin students who otherwise would
seek specialized international education through programs outside the State.
It is anticipated that area businesses may encourage and support employees to
pursue the degree to increase their value to the company. Because
international specialty degree programs at the undergraduate level are not
numerous, students in surrounding states also may enroll.  
  
4.5 Comparable Programs Elsewhere in Wisconsin: none  
  
4.6 Comparable Programs Outside Wisconsin (as applicable):  
  
While specialized internationally focused degrees are not uncommon at the
graduate (particularly master's) level, they are uncommon at the undergraduate
level. There are numerous majors in international studies, within the State
and elsewhere, but baccalaureate degree programs are few. One of the best
known is offered through  "The Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service at
Georgetown University," which was founded in 1919. The Georgetown University
program requires that students pass a proficiency examination in a foreign
language, but the level of proficiency is generally equivalent to two years of
college course work. The UWM proposed program would ensure a higher level of
language competency through four years of required language study.

**Course Description:**

This course focuses on advanced concepts in quantitative methods for nursing,
including application to nursing problems and solution strategies using
computer software.

**Pre-requisites:**

ND Level II standing

**Course Objectives:**

At the conclusion of the course, the student will be able to:

1\. Analyze how information technology can contribute to the practice of
nursing, support the development of the profession and assist in the care of
individuals, work groups and communities.  
2\. Examine Informatics applications and their use in disease prevention and
health promotion.  
3\. Differentiate the use of decision support and expert systems in
identifying solution strategies for nursing practice and clinical
epidemiologic decisions.  
4\. Analyze the concept of the lifetime electronic medical record, define its
place in the information flow of the patient encounter and its impact on the
prevention of disease and promotion of health.  
5\. Utilize CWRUNET resources to accomplish course objectives including the
CANDO database, the World Wide Web and interactive tools from the United
States Bureau of the Census and the National Center for Health Statistics.  
6\. Demonstrate commitment and accountability to professional standards.

**Educational Support:**

We are available to meet with students who have disabilities to discuss
academic accommodations. In addition, please be sure to contact the
Coordinator of Disability Services, ESS, K. Smith Library Room 105, 368-5230.

**Student/Course Conduct:**

This course contains only a didactic portion. Students must turn in all
individual assignments, on time, in order to successfully complete NUND 222.
Students who turn in assignments after the due date without prior instructor
approval will automatically receive a failing grade (0 points) on that
assignment and are in danger of failing the course regardless of their
performance on other assignments.

Conduct, requirements, and grades in the didactic portion of the course are
the responsibility of the didactic faculty listed on the first page of this
syllabus. Classes will be a mix of lecture and discussion. Students are
expected to come to each class on time, to have read all assigned readings
before class, and to participate in classroom discussions.

All students must adhere to all policies listed in the Frances Payne Bolton
School of Nursing Handbook and Frances Payne Bolton School of Nursing
Bulletin.

**Conceptual Framework:**

Knowledge of information technology is essential for nursing to fulfill its
mission as a social force in the care of individuals, families, work groups,
and communities. Understanding concepts of epidemiology and introductory
Biostatistics will enhance the practice of nursing, the knowledge base of
nurses and the optimal delivery of client care. Understanding how information
systems enhance practice, education, administration and research is integral
to the nursing knowledge system.

**Learning-Teaching Strategies:**

This is a one semester course that will utilize lecture, demonstration, group
participation and individual effort to attain the objectives.  
    
  **Evaluation Methods:**  
**Evaluation will be based on process and outcomes.** **Process Measures** |
15% or 150 points | Process will include measures such as participation in
discussions, individual conversations with faculty, and group behaviors. Class
participation will be evaluated based on voluntary and responsive performance
individually and in groups. Per instructor prerogative, process points may
also be used for unannounced quizzes.

**Please note** : Process measures are an integral part of academic
performance. As such, they can determine your final course grade. 100%
performance on homework, quizzes and examinations does not guarantee an "A" in
the course. Your active participation in class, attendance and professional
attitude are also part of the final grade.  
---|---|---  
**Outcome Measures** |  85% or 850 points | There will be two outcome measures
including a midterm and a final examination. The percentage of each of these
outcome measures are explained below.  
1\. Midterm examination | 42.5% or 425 points | The examination will include
content from lectures, assigned readings, class discussion and assigned web
sites.  
2.  Final examination  | 42.5% or 425 points  | The examination will include content from lectures, assigned readings, class discussion and assigned web sites.  The examination will be comprehensive and conducted during final exam week.   
  
**Grading Scale**

Total Course Points: 1000 points

A = 90-100% 900-1000 points  
B = 80-89% 800-899 points  
C = 70-79% 700-799 points  
F = below 70% below 700 points

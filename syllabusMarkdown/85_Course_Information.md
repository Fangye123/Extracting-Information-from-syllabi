### Course Information

This course applies linguistic principles to the study of the English
vocabulary. We will examine the rich stock of morphemes, or meaningful
elements, in English words, and observe how these combine to derive much of
the vocabulary of English. Other topics investigated include the development
of the English vocabulary, derivational processes, pronunciation
(articulatory) processes, etymology (word histories), sound change and meaning
change, the linguistic relations of English, sources of new words, usage and
variation, and slang. No previous experience with Linguistics is required.

As far as possible, students will be encouraged to make their own
investigations and discuss their findings and questions about words in class.
Students will work to increase their mastery of English vocabulary from the
technical, literary, scientific and other domains by acquiring recurrent
morphemes and words incorporating them; and by generally increasing their
awareness of the structure, history, and use of English words.

**Course Objectives** : By the end of the course, the student should:

  * have an awareness of the internal structure of words and of the systematic relationships among words in English  

  * have a basic understanding of the history of the English language, with particular reference to the major periods of vocabulary expansion that it has undergone and how those periods are reflected in the modern lexicon  

  * understand some basic principles of language change that have affected the English language, including principles of sound change and meaning change  

  * know the basic stock of Classical roots and affixes that recurrently appear in English words; be able to interpret newly encountered words incorporating elements of that stock  

  * be familiar with a wide range of words and their origins, meanings, and domains of use; be able to apply the knowledge gained so as to be able to say something about the origin and/or meaning of unfamiliar words  

  * understand how the study of words can be used as an access point into knowledge and history of an entire culture, and be able to further pursue such knowledge via the study of words  

  * have a good working knowledge of the incredibly rich lexical resources available in the English language, providing a basis for increased mastery of the spoken and written language

A note on "Participation": Because of the physical layout of the room, it was
not really possible to have a discussion format. Students would be talking to
the backs of each others' heads, and the acoustics are so bad I could hardly
hear speakers in the FRONT of the room, where there is no resonance (no, I'm
not going deaf).

My solution is to make the baseline score for participation 4 out of 5 points.
The 5th point is earned by those who asked questions and made comments.

In addition to assigned readings specified on the syllabus, students are
responsible for reading class 'handouts' as they become activated on the web.
Exams will cover readings, class discussions, and 'handouts'. Quizzes will
cover the Morpheme Sets in the Appendix to the Denning and Leben textbook. See
Syllabus for schedule of quizzes and exams.

### Honor Code Issues:

To avoid unclarity about academic standards relating to use of the World Wide
Web, these standards are posted on the following links:

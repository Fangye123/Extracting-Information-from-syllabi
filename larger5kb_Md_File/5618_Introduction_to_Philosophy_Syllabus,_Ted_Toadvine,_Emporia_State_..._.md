**_TEXT_** :  
_Traversing Philosophical Boundaries_ , Max Hallman, ed. (Wadsworth, 1998).

**_COURSE GOALS AND TOPICS:_**  
The main objective of this course is to introduce you to philosophical ways of
thinking and train you to think and write critically about philosophical
issues. In addition, the course will introduce you to a wide range of
historical and contemporary perspectives on perennial philosophical questions:
what is the nature of the self? What is the nature of reality? How can I know
what is right? What is the nature of religious belief? Unlike courses which
place emphasis on transmitting content to be memorized, this course invites
you to reflect on the significance and meaning of your own life, and the role
philosophical reflection may play in it.

This course satisfies the General Education requirement in Literature and
Ideas (Basic Skills VI) for certain majors and is a Multicultural Intensive
Course.

**_COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING:_**  
Your final grade will be determined as follows:

6 quizzes @ 5% each   =                   30%  
4 in-class exams @ 17.5% each  =    70%  
                                                         \-----   
                                                        100% 

Quizzes, based on assigned readings and previous class discussions, will be
unannounced. These brief, open-book quizzes at the beginning of class are to
insure preparation for class discussion. Passing quizzes will require that you
CAREFULLY read all assignments on time and attend class. Makeup quizzes will
not be given for those who arrive late for class. Exams, including the non-
cumulative final, will include an "objective" (true/false, multiple choice,
short answer) and an essay component. You will need to bring blue books with
you for the final exam.

You will be expected to attend class and to come prepared to discuss assigned
material. Missing three classes will result in a full grade reduction. In the
event of an absence when a quiz is given or an essay is due, you must notify
me in advance of the absence or if there is an emergency as soon as possible
after the emergency. If you miss because of an emergency, I expect you to
document it. No make-ups will be given otherwise.

Academic dishonest of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes
plagiarism, the paraphrase or quotation of any published or unpublished source
without full and clear acknowledgement. The university policy regarding
academic dishonest, as explained in the Student Handbook (p. 37), will be
strictly enforced.

For help answering essay questions on exams, please read the Appendix in
Hallman, "Writing Philosophically" (665-684). Further assistance is available
from the Writing Center, 345 Southeast Morse Hall. You can check the Writing
Center hours or ask grammar and writing questions by calling the Grammar
Hotline, 341-5380. If you anticipate trouble with your writing, please consult
with the Writing Center or myself as soon as possible during the semester.
Students having trouble with writing fundamentals may be required to seek
assistance from the Writing Center as a condition for continuing in the
course.

If you have a documented disability and wish to discuss academic
accommodations or emergency evacuation, please contact me as soon as possible.

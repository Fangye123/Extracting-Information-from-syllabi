**Course Grading**

  1. Small Projects: 50% of your grade

  
OOP1, OOP2, Use case 1, Use case 2, Analysis, Analysis Pattern, Design, ...
UML Metamodel  
The exact number of projects is to be determined.  This list of project titles
will be linked to the assignments when they are ready.  Some projects are to
be done individually.  Others are to be done in teams of three students.  


  2. Midterm Exam: 25% of your grade

  
You are to work completely by yourself. Ask questions only of the instructor.
This will be done individually, in class.  


  3. Final Exam: 25% of your grade

  
You are to work completely by yourself. Ask questions only of the instructor.
This will be done individually, in class.

The grading scale is: 90-100 A    80-89 B   70-79 C    Below 69 F

Grades will be influenced by attendance and class participation. Your
participation will be used to judge whether youire keeping up with the reading
assignments.

**Course Slides**  
Course slides will be available as Adobe Acrobat files, as the course
proceeds, on line. You are encouraged to print them, bring them to class, and
take your notes on them.   We will also supply copies of the notes in class.

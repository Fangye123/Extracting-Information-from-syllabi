Overview
We will review empirical findings that support
or fail to support common beliefs about gender, the relationship of
gender to traditional issues in psychology (e.g., moral development,
personality, interpersonal relationships), and special issues
pertinent to gender, (e.g., parenthood, violence, and sexual
orientation). Class and small-group discussions, guest speakers, and
films will supplement reading material and provide more in-depth
examination of specific topics.
Course Requirements
Please Note: This course
will not be easy. It will be intellectually rigorous and intense. If
you are looking for an easy course, then this is not the course for
you.
The course requirements include doing the
reading, attending class, writing weekly discussion essays,
participating in small-group class discussion and exercises, reading
an on-line electronic discussion, PsychInfo assignment, taking the
quizzes, and also completing a final poster project.
Contact Hours and Class Attendance
We will meet each Tuesday and Thursday
9:30-10:50 in 242 Gerlinger and your attendance is expected.
This is not a course to take if you
anticipate missing more than one class meeting, as class discussion
quizzes and exercises are crucial to your success in the
course. Also, you will be working in a
small group in class and asked to complete various activities in your
small group. Your participation is part of the course requirements.
We also recommend that you check your email at least twice a week, as
important course information may be posted by the instructor on the
course listserv (see below for more about this).
Required Readings
Readings are assigned on a weekly basis.
Readings are to be completed BEFORE the Tuesday
class meeting for which they are assigned. There is one required text
book and two required books of readings, available for purchasing at
the book store. In addition there are readings on reserve for this
course at Knight Library. This course has a serious amount of reading
and you will not be able to do well on the quizzes or essays if you
do not do the reading. Each week close to 100 pages of reading must
be completed. Please do not take this
course if you cannot manage this amount of reading.

Grading and Requirements - More Details
Quizzes 100 points
SEVEN Quizzes will be given. Each quiz will be
worth 20 points. Your FIVE highest quiz scores will be added together
to determine your total quiz score. Because you may drop two of your
quiz grades, there will be NO MAKE-UP quizzes. The quizzes will be
challenging. They will be structured to assess your knowledge of the
readings, in-class films and lectures, and class discussions. The
format will include multiple choice, short-answer, and short essays.
The questions will primarily pertain to the readings assigned for the
week in which the quiz is given. Other questions will pertain to the
previous week's readings, classroom discussion, lecture, and/or
demonstrations. Sometimes a question will refer to material covered
earlier in the course, or issues discussed in our class listserv,
psygen@lists.
Discussion Essays 80 points
Written essays must be typed (or computer
printed) and one essay must be turned in each Tuesday (Weeks 2-9) at
the beginning of class. If you absolutely cannot type or
computer-print your essay, you must write it very neatly on nice
paper (e.g.: no pages written from a spiral notebook!). Each essay
should show you have put thought into the reading material, and be
designed to stimulate thoughtful class discussion about the reading
and/or related issues. Think of the discussion essay as an
opportunity to think deeply about the readings, to reflect on the
meaning of the material to you and your life, or to society and
scholarship. We will typically provide some specific topics to write
about for each week. The topics for the first assignment are below..
Each essay will be worth up to 10 points. A point will be subtracted
for each day late. We expect a one or two-page typed essay per week.
If you draw specific connections between the readings and your ideas
in your essay, you will probably get a better grade than if you fail
to connect your ideas to the readings.
ASSIGNMENT FOR ESSAY #1 (due April 6): For the
first essay you have a choice of two different topics. You must do
the reading for Weeks 1 & 2 FIRST or these questions will not
make sense! A) At this early point in the course, identify your
perspective on sex and gender as best you can. Think of where you are
along the two continua: minimalism to maximalism; and essentialism to
social constructionism. In what ways do you agree and/or disagree
with the feminist orientation described by the text (A&L)
authors? B) Collins includes many suggestions for introspective
analysis of issues of privilege and oppression. For example, in what
ways are you victimized within the social categories to which you
belong? In what ways are you an oppressor to others, reinforcing
their subordination? Who are you? What are the different aspects of
your identity? How do they interrelate with race, class, and gender?
Identify things that would be more or less difficult for you to do if
you had a different identity.
Library Assignment 10 points
A written library assignment worth 10 points is
due on April 15. The purpose of this assignment is to make sure you
know how to use crucial library resources such as "Orbis" and
"PsychInfo" -- you will need these resources for completing the
library research on your final poster project. The assignment must be
completed and turned in by April 15. You will need to use the World
Wide Web to do this assignment. A tutorial with information about the
library resources and the assignment itself can be found at:
http://axe.uoregon.edu/subjguid/psychology/psyc380/

Final Project: Poster 80 points
The final project will be an individual or
small-team activity that you do outside
of class meeting time. The final project will be in the
form of a written "poster." Details about the poster form can be
found at the poster guidelines page (
http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jfreyd/psygen/poster.html )
The project will present material you have learned and synthesized
about a particular topic in psychology of gender. You will pick a
topic fairly early in the quarter to learn more about. You will have
a selection of topics you can choose from. A "poster" in university
level psychology is not exactly the same thing as you may have
learned to do in high school. It does involve a visual presentation
and shortened text, but the point is not to show lots of photos or
pretty colors (although they may be used too) but to communicate
scholarly and intellectual material in a concise manner. Your posters
will be modeled on professional posters shown at professional
psychology conventions. During the last 2 weeks of class the posters
will be shared with the rest of the class. This is a very exciting
time, as we get to learn from each other. Students will display their
posters and classmates and the instructors will evaluate the posters.

Poster Project Teams: Each student will have the choice of
working alone on the final project, or, instead, with one, two, or
three other classmates (a maximum of 4 people may work together in a
team). We encourage the teamwork approach, because working
collaboratively is educational in its own right. The projects will be
graded on the same criteria whether produced by one, two, three, or
four people (thus it would really seem a good idea to work in
teams!). Project partners or teams must make a commitment to work
together by April 29. All students will be required to turn in a
final project participation and work evaluation form at the end of
the term. If you work on the project alone you will evaluate your own
work. If you work with a partner or team you will also evaluate
separately your and your partner's or team member's contribution and
work. These evaluations are very important and will be graded for
content and clarity and completeness. (See below for more information
on the team participation evaluations.)
In addition, each student or team must submit a planning abstract
for the final poster in advance of completing the project. The
planning abstract is due on April 22
An extra credit option is to publish the project on the World Wide
Web. (For WWW publication guidelines see
http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jfreyd/psygen/termweb.html.) Note: your grade on the final project will be
severely lowered if it is at all late. The completed poster (and the
WWW version of the final project if your group does that) is due on
Tuesday, May 25 by 11:00 AM. Classroom presentations will occur in
the Psygen Convention on May 27, June 1, and June 3 and attendance is
required during all these classes. More details about this
project will be given in class as the term progresses.
Participation 30 points
Participation is crucial in this course.
Participation includes in class discussion and on-line discussion
(see section below about how to subscribe to the class mailing list,
"psygen" so you can participate in on-line discussion). You are
required to subscribe to the listserv "psygen" by April 8. You are
not required to post anything on the listserv, although you may earn
extra credit by posting valuable contributions. You are required to
read the listserv messages at least twice a week. In-class
participation will largely be in the form of small groups. You will
work with a group throughout the quarter. Groups will sometimes be
assigned in class assignments that must be turned in. Each student
will complete an evaluation of each member of the group, including
self, and these evaluations will be used in helping determine your
grade for this part of the course. These evaluations are
very important and will be graded for content and clarity and
completeness. (See below for more information on the small group
participation evaluations.)
On-Line discussion: PsyGen
We will have an electronic discussion as part
of this course. It is essential that you get an e-mail account
immediately if you do not have one. Undergraduates at the UO can get
free accounts on the computer "gladstone" and typically use the
"Pine" e-mail system. For more information, see the Computing Center
publications "How to Get a Computing Account" and "Using Pine for
E-mail", available on line or from the Computing Center Documents
Room. If you have questions related to the use of gladstone or
e-mail, contact one of the Computing Center's consultants (CC rooms
233-239; phone 346-1758; e-mail consult@gladstone.uoregon.edu) rather
than the course instructor or TA.
On-line discussions will be conducted using a
course-wide mailing list (sometimes called a "listserv"), named
"psygen". By the second week of class you must subscribe to this
mailing list by sending an e-mail message from your e-mail account to
the program that manages the list, i.e. to
"majordomo@lists.uoregon.edu". In that message, leave the "Subject"
line blank, and in the body of the message include two lines:
"subscribe psygen", and "end".

--- Message Text ---
subscribe psygen
end
Once you have subscribed to the mailing list,
you can post messages to the class by sending e-mail to the address
"psygen@lists.uoregon.edu".
You are expected to read the on-line
discussions. Posting your own messages is optional. You may earn
extra credit for thought-provoking messages. However, in order to
avoid having the on-line discussion become unmanageable, each student
will also have a maximum number of posted messages (enforced if
necessary) of 2 per week. Also any given message should be no longer
than 50 lines of text. The on-line discussion will be an open-ended
discussion based on student interests and class discussions. The
instructor will also use the list to post important course-related
information.
Please see additional important information
about using email in this class at http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jfreyd/psygen/email.html

More About In-Class Small Groups
Near the beginning of the quarter the class
will be divided into small groups that will last throughout the
quarter. Groups will be made up of approximately 6 students and will
work together in-class. The maximum group size is 7 students and the
minimum is 5 students. The instructor will assign you to your group.
If you have a particular reason you cannot work within your group you
will have the opportunity to request a change. April 22 will be the
last day for changing group assignments; you may request on that day
to move out of your group and then, based on the instructor's
determination, you will be placed in a new group, space permitting.
Also on that date the instructor may move around some students if any
given group has become smaller than 5 students or other problems have
arisen.
Small groups will be responsible for
maintaining cohesion and equity. The group is responsible for
ensuring that everyone is contributing to the small group in as
equitable a way as possible. Each student in the course will be
required to complete an evaluations of every member of the small
group he or she is in (including a self evaluation). The information
on the evaluations will then be used by the instructor for
determining course points (see grade above). A well-functioning,
equitable group is likely to have very positive evaluations of each
member, provide help in studying for the quizzes, and facilitate a
friendly learning environment, so achieving such a group is in each
member's self interest.
Please note:
Your in-class small group is different from
your poster project team. The in-class group is from 5-7 students. The project
team is from 1-4 students. You are assigned to your in-class small
group. In contrast you select your own final project team.
Teams meet outside of class; groups meet
in class.
More About Participation Evaluations (in-class group and final
project team)
You will be required to turn in two separate evaluations at the
end of the term. These evaluations impact your grade and it is very
important you do a thorough job. One evaluation is for your in-class
participation and the other evaluation is for your final project
participation.
In-Class Group Participation
Evaluation. Your in class participation
is worth up to 30 points. Of these 30 points we will take into
account your self evaluation and the evaluations your group members
submit for you as part of the In-Class Participation Evaluation .
This evaluation addresses contributions of each member of the group
(including yourself) in group discussions. Your self-evaluation should be particularly thorough --
about one page long. We will also take
into account what we observed about your group functioning and your
role within your group. You must turn in your In-Class Participation
Evaluation by 11 AM on May 27th If you do not turn in your In-Class
Participation Evaluation you will lose 15 points. For every day it is
late you will lose 5 points. An insufficient evaluation will also
lose points (e.g. if you do not justify your ratings for
individuals).
You will assign a number between 1 and 10 (10
being perfect) measuring your evaluation of the participation of each
member of your group. First devise a system for rating the
participation of each member and briefly explain your system (e.g.,
you should be taking into account reliability, cooperation,
preparedness, creativity, leadership, and any other factors that
determined the contribution of each group member). Next, for each
group member starting with yourself, write the group member's name,
the participation rating you give to that person, then a brief justification of the rating for that
individual specifically.
Your evaluation should be TYPED and it should
use a format similar to the following: 



Your Name:  
Group name: 
Group number:
         

0. Briefly describe your
         rating system:

1. Your Name
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating

2. Name of Member
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating

3. Name of Member
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating

4 Name of Member
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating

5. Name of Member
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating

6. Name of Member
         
         Rating
         
         Justification for rating


Final Project Team Participation
Evaluation. Your participation in your
final project group is worth up to 20 points. Of these 20 points we
will take into account your self evaluation and, if you worked with a
partner or team, the evaluations your partner or team members submit
for you as part of Final Project Evaluation. This evaluation
addresses contributions of each team member of the project group
(including yourself) to the final project and presentation.
Your self-evaluation should be
particularly thorough -- about one page long. We will also take into account what we observed about
your project team functioning and your role within your team. You
must turn in an Final Project Evaluation by 5 PM on June 3rd. If you
do not turn in this evaluation you will lose 20 points. For every day
it is late you will lose 10 points. An insufficient evaluation will
also lose points (e.g. if you do not justify your ratings for
individuals).
You should first design and describe a rating
system, then evaluate each group member starting with yourself on a 1
to 10 scale. Your evaluation should be TYPED and should use the
format described above.
Extra Credit Up to 20 points
Extra Credit can be earned in a variety of ways
up to 20 extra points total. If you make especially valuable
contributions to class discussion, or if you make especially valuable
contributions to the email discussion, you may earn extra points. Or
you can get extra credit for a particularly terrific project. This
might include a special presentation or publishing your project on
the WEB (for WWW publication guidelines see http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jfreyd/psygen/termweb.html.) In general, if you do something creative, special,
contributive, and above-and-beyond the course requirements, you may
earn extra credit.
Additional Notes
Academic Honesty
All work submitted in this course must be your own and produced
exclusively for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations,
paraphrases) must be properly acknowledged and documented. For the
consequences of academic dishonesty, refer to the Schedule of Classes
published quarterly. Violations will be taken seriously and are noted
on student disciplinary records. If you are in doubt regarding any
aspect of these issues as they pertain to this course, please consult
with the instructor before you complete any relevant requirements of
the course. (Text adopted here as recommended from the UO web site
regarding academic honesty at:
http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~conduct/).

Students with Directory Restricted Access
This course includes required on-line
participation (electronic mail and World Wide Web). If you have
restricted access to your directory information and wish to have
special arrangements made for this course, please notify the
instructor immediately.
Students with Disabilities
If you have a documented disability and
anticipate needing accommodations in this course, please make
arrangements to meet with the instructor soon. Also please request
that the Counselor for Students with Disabilities send a letter
verifying your disability. [Counselor for Students with Disabilities:
Hillary Gerdes, 346-3211, TTY 346-1083,

A Special Note about The Nature of Discussions in this Class

In this class we will be discussing issues
which may have, at times, an intense personal significance for some
members of the class. There are no taboos for discussion topics in
this course. We will exercise and respect freedom of speech. At the
same time, we must take responsibility to ensure that we are
respectful of everyone's opinion and that we stay on topic. We will
be focusing especially on critical thinking and the use of empirical
data to evaluate theories about gender. If you find you are troubled
by material while taking this course, and need support or counseling,
please be sure to pursue that external support by seeking out a
supportive friend, counselor, and/or a social service. The other
class members and the instructor and TAs cannot fulfill that function
in a class this size and with the mission of an academic experience.
(Also see http://dynamic.uoregon.edu/~jfreyd/psygen/email.html for e-mail etiquette.)

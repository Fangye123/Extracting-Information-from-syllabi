Primitivism in 20th Century Literature and Art  
Wendy Faris  

  

* * *

**Description:** This course will investigate the inspiration that the arts of
indigenous societies have provided for modern western culture, and the ways in
which those arts have played a central role in the development of major modern
visual and literary movements. In a sense/ we will be studying the process by
which, beginning in the nineteenth century, and continuing through the
present, it has become necessary to put quotation marks around the word
"primitive" as it refers to cultural artifacts. Clearly, this process involves
an increasing appreciation of indigenous culture, but it also raises problems
on both sides of this cultural exchange. Most recently, this issue of
primtivism with its dangers of commodification and the appropriation of voices
and styles is situated at the heart of theories and controversies concerning
race, gender, and class, and elite versus popular modes in the study of
culture. We will keep those issues in mind, and read parts of several
important recent studies dealing with them, but our primary concern will be to
analyze particular examples of primitivist literature and painting. We will
focus on this modern painting and literature, but we will also extend our
discussions to include material from other fields, such as intellectual
history, anthropology, and psychology.

**Requirements:** In addition to participating in class discussions, seminar
members will write one or two papers totalling approximately 20 pages and make
one short class presentation.

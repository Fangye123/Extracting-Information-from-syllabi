Police and Policing is a survey course that focuses on the  role law
enforcement plays in the United States. It builds on the introductory material
in criminal justice to include reading, writing, and internet assignments
designed to delve into modern policing. The structure and history of police,
the nature of police work, including community policing, the debates over
police discretion, community relations, and police misconduct are covered in
this course.

##  Rules of the Road

> ##  _Make-Ups:_

Students who have conflicts on the days of scheduled exams should contact me
beforehand in order to arrange for an early testing date. Students who miss an
exam for reasons beyond their control should contact me as soon as possible in
order to be eligible for a make up. Emergency situations must be clearly
documented.

> ##  _Attendance:_

Students are expected to attend classes on a regular basis, although I allow
three absences per student during the semester. Excessive absences tend to
lower grades, especially by reducing participation points (15% of your final
grade).

> ##  _Due Dates:_

Assignments are to be turned in at the beginning of the class hour on the date
scheduled.  One half letter grade will be deducted for each day an assignment
is late.

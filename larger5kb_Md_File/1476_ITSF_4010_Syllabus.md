**Course Organization**

This course deals with anthropological concepts that illuminate the
sociocultural context of education as well as the role of educational
institutions in community, national, and regional development. Class lectures,
discussions and a film series are integral components of the course and have
been designed to complement each other and to add depth and dimension to the
semester's activities. Students are urged to take advantage of the
opportunities offered.

**Lectures**. Each class meeting will deal with a specific topic (see attached
schedule). The themes of the required readings roughly parallel those of the
lectures. Weekly reading assignments should be completed before each lecture.

**Discussion Group**. Participation in a weekly discussion group is
**required** of all students taking the course for **four (4) points** and
recommended but not required for those taking the course for three (3) points.
The discussion group will be led by Mr. Taddei and its schedule of meetings
will be arranged during the first class meeting.

** Film Series**. Films will supplement and complement course lectures and
topics. Consult the film schedule for further information

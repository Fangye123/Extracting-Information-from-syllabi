**College of Education Mission Statement: ** The unit (college of education)
prepares systematic, problem solving educators: reflective, technologically
skilled, interactive facilitators capable of versatile decision making in
diverse settings. The knowledge base of the unit contains three elements:
philosophical base, current research, and systematic problem solving.
Reflective experiences are the threads of commonality that bind the elements
together. ****



**Catalog Description** : A study of the major psychological theories, models,
research, and principles that apply to the teaching and learning process.
Special attention will be given to cognitivistic approaches.

3.     Identify and describe metacognitive and self-regulatory processes

4.     Be able to grasp the important issues in the acquisition of language

5.     Be able to relate cognitive processes to brain processes in a general way.

**Instructional Approach** : I will lecture some in this course, but we will
also engage in discussion and in a number of different activities. For
example, we will do some on line demonstrations of different cognitive tasks.
We will also do some cooperative learning activities. The first part of the
semester will focus largely on the Bruning et al. book. We will supplement
those readings with some from the Byrnes book. As we get further along we will
do some focused discussion of the Byrnes book, and add in the readings from
Bransford et al. and Jacob.



**Course requirements**



1.     **Article Review: ** Each of you **** will each do an article review from a scholarly article that addresses a cognitive psychology concept discussed in Bruning et al. It will account for 10 % of your grade.

2.     **Literature Review** : Each of you will write a review of research on a relevant learning topic. Your topic needs to be approved by the instructor prior to beginning the paper. Topics should be approved by me by March 26 at the latest. The review will be due on April 30. It will account for 25 % of your grade.

3.     **Thought Questions** : You will get a series of 5 thought questions throughout the semester. They will cover material from the lectures and discussions. Each question will be worth 12% of your grade.

4.     **Class Participation** : The remaining portion of your grade will be determined by your participation in various in-class activities. These will include demonstrations, group activities, and discussions. I will rate you on a 5 point scale to determine your participation.

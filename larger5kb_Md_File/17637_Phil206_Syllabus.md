>>> ###  Grading Criteria

>>>

>>> **     Grading will be based on attendance, participation in discussion,
and three papers.  The foundation of the class will be discussion of the
texts, highlighting the arguments presented, the system developed, and the
implications that follow.  Attendance is therefore mandatory.**

>>>

>>> **     In order to get to know and appreciate you as an individual,  every
student will be required to visit my office at least once during the semester.
Appointment sheets will be available during class, or attached to my office
door.  You will be encouraged to communicate by email for questions,
emergencies, or submitting work, but it is also important that we get a chance
to talk one on one at least once.**

>>>

>>> **     Three papers will be due by the end of the semester.  These papers
will be based on experience with three of the four systems covered in class.
Students will be asked to take a 24 hour period and live their life as if they
were a follower of one of the systems.  They will then be asked to
philosophically reflect on this experience in the form of an essay 7-10 pages
in length.  The first paper will be due by March 8th, the second paper will be
due April 5th, the third will be due May 3rd.** ****

>>>

>>> **     No work will be accepted late.  No hand written work will be
accepted.  You may submit your work by either email or computer disk, but you
need to check with me to make sure that I can access your work.  I reserve the
right to initiate reading quizzes if discussions show that the reading is not
being done adequately.**  
> **     75% of the grade will be based upon papers submitted.**  
> **     25% of the grade will be based upon attendance and participation.**

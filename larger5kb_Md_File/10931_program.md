**PUBLIC HISTORY PROGRAM CURRICULUM  **

**1981-2001**

     During its nearly twenty years of operation New York University's Program in Public History has reworked its curriculum and training process several times. One of the earlier (1984) changes followed from students' desires for closer ties between their reading and practical projects. Consequently we then created one semester course, Introduction to Public History. This course introduced new students in the program to a range of Public History literatures and methodologies; equally important, it fashioned a collaborative, hands-on project which would culminate in an all-day Public History Workshop for the relevant audiences. The course explored in broad problems that would be developed more fully in our three core courses: Local and Community History, History and Public Policy, and Media and History. In addition, separate units of the Introductory course concerned issues in Material Culture, Historical Fiction, etc. Several short, "applied" projects accompanied these studies 

     The distinctive feature of the Introductory course was the practical, collaborative exercise, a collective research project to which all participants contributed. In the first year that we offered the course (1985-86), the course centered on the gentrification of an urban community - the East Village - and in the second year (1986-87) \- the transformation of a social settlement house - Greenwich House in the Village. Functionally the collaborative research project paralleled the course work. Teachers and students alike readily admitted that the research component consumed the time and energy that was nearly equivalent to another course. The deadline pressure intensified because the semester's research was arranged for a public presentation/workshop at the end of the semester (along with final exams). In both years physical pressures alone dictated that the workshop actually be scheduled several weeks into the subsequent semester. While both workshops went well, most participants felt far more a sense of physical relief at the end than of intellectual or professional satisfaction. 

     For academic year 1987-88 the Introduction to Public History was a **two semester** course: the first, effectively a Research Seminar, explored the literatures and methodologies of Public History and applied this knowledge to the investigation of a common topic, in this case, a significant urban space, Washington Square; the second half of the course, a Colloquium/Practicum, converted the research into varied public formats, which drew collaboratively upon the previous semester's research. The two segments of the Introduction to Public History will be in their way self- contained; since 1988-89 - when the target of research was NYU itself - they have generally been taught by Profs. Paul H. Mattingly and Rachel Bernstein respectively, though, of course, both halves are closely co-ordinated for maximum effect. The separation of these two activities removed the hot-house effect of the previous years. The Public History introductory course then concentrated its research attention during 1989-90 on Union Square, another significant public space; in 1991-92 we concentrated on Chinatown and in 1992-93 on the renown Henry St. Settlement, which was celebrating its centennial. 

     For a host of pedagogical and fiscal reasons the Introduction to Public History will now be offered every **two** years. Although this introductory experience will not be offered during 1999-2000, each semester one of the courses especially designed for the Public History program will be available. During 1994-95 the Introduction to Public History continued our focus upon on the dynamics of New York City's Lower East Side and worked collaboratively with Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street. Especially noteworthy was this experience, not only for the high quality of the scholarship but the innovative reworking of the research into multi-media venues. We were particularly fortunate in working with the Tisch School of the Art Program in Interactive Telecommunication and the Department of Dramatic Writing, associations, which I hasten to add, we continued into the 1995-96 cycle, a comparative analysis of working class communities in both the Lower East Side (where we are collaborated with Seward Park High School) and Spanish Harlem (where we collaborated with the Museum of the City of New York, a member of the community). This Museum connection has developed into a formal partnership, which we have sustained into the 1997-99 cycle. Our thematic focus for this period and the following (1999-2001) cycle will be: "Public Activism in a Metropolitan Culture." 

     The students in every Introductory course have contextualized the sites and issues, and they have used both archives and material artifacts to develop historical interpretations of the area's past. Students working both singly and in groups have studied different facets of their common project and have prepared their work in "public" formats for the all-day workshop in May of the respective year. A synthetic statement of the program educational ideology can be found in "The Pedagogy of Public History" by Rachel Bernstein and Paul H. Mattingly, an article that appeared in the Fall 1998 issue of _The Journal of American Ethnic History_. 

**New Concentration in Public History**

     The expansion of the introductory course to two-semesters, however, has prompted further curricular changes. The three core courses, required for previous students and still required for those who seek the New York State Regents Certificate in Public History, will become "recommended only" for those who choose. It will now be possible, for those not taking the full 44 credit certificate program, to take a masters degree with a Public History concentration in 32 credits, the regular Department of History requirement. The required courses for the general program, which can qualify for the Departmental Minor, now stand as follows:   
    
  | Introduction to Public History | 8 credits  
---|---  
Oral History or Historical Statistics | 4    "  
MA Seminar in History | 4    "  
One of 3 PHP Concentration Courses | 4    "  
Electives | 12  "  
Total | 32  "  
  
     The courses in the Public History Program can constitute a Minor at the doctoral level.

Mattingly](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/history/public_history/faculty.html#Paul
H. Mattingly)

     The course will review the history of public history from Charles Beard to the present (ex: National Council on Public History's video _Public History Today_ ) and will examine the relationship between different public audiences and formats. In addition, all students will research a common topic, participate in discussion on relevant secondary literature and produce an original essay, based on primary sources, by semester's end.

Bernstein](http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/history/public_history/faculty.html#Rachel
Bernstein.)  
     The course will capitalize on the data base and practiced skills of G57.1750 and focus the class's energies upon the conversion of the previous semester's research into different media for a public presentation. Ideally this common project will be collaborative and capitalize upon new research upon the designated topic but also transform this research via teamwork into an all-day Workshop at the end of the semester.

     THE THREE FOLLOWING COURSES ARE HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR ALL PUBLIC HISTORY STUDENTS. _ONE COURSE ONLY_ IS REQUIRED FOR THE REGULAR MA DEGREE; _ALL_ ARE REQUIRED FOR THE MA PLUS CERTIFICATE FROM THE NY STATE BOARD OF REGENTS [44 CREDITS].    
| A) _Local and Community History_ (G57.1752) [4 CREDITS] Prof. Peter J. Wosh
or Adjunct Professor  
     Local and community history generates some of the liveliest and most engaging scholarship within the profession. It also provides a principal point of contact and collaboration between academic historians and their broader publics. All public historians need to think carefully and constructively about community formation, the complexities of incorporating community perspectives into their work, and the relationship between history and community memory. This course examines the literature of the field, paying special attention to classic works and path-breaking interpretations. It also seeks to bring graduate students into contact with curators, archivists, and public historians who work with communities. Students will visit and evaluate museum exhibits, historical films, preservation projects, and heritage sites as part of their ongoing coursework. A special emphasis involves the ways in which historians might innovatively interpret their work within local and community contexts. History as a collaborative and community based endeavor receives particular attention.

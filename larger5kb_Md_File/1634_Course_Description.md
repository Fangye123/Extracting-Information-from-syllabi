**__OBJECTIVES OF THE COURSE_ :_**

**To acquire an understanding of significant historical trends in various
areas of the humanities and their contribution to the intellectual history of
world culture in the period from antiquity to ca.1600 (for Humanities I) and
from 1600 to the present (for Humanities II)**

**To learn to cultivate an aesthetic appreciation of the fine and performing
arts and to understand interrelationships among the fine and performing arts
in both Western and non-Western traditions;**

**To become familiar with selected examples of literature, drama, fine art,
music, and philosophy and to be able to discuss matters of style and influence
with respect to these works; and**

**To foster an attitude of intellectual curiosity and inquiry about the
humanities and develop skills in writing and critical thinking from both
perceptual and conceptual standpoints.**  


**__ABOUT THE HUMANITIES I & IISEQUENCE_ :  _Humanities I and II will examine
ways in which different cultures and time periods address common issues and
concerns that have always been part of the human experience.The integrated
sequence of Humanities I and II differs from the traditional Area C offerings
in the Core by providing a historically comprehensive overview of the sweep of
artistic experience. In addition, it utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to
show connections among the disciplinesof the fine arts, music, drama,
literature, and philosophy as well as each discipline's own special way of
representing and giving voice to human concerns.**  
    
    
? | **__PLACE OF THIS COURSE IN THE CORE CURRICULUM_ :_**  Humanities I and II
are designed to fulfill, as a two-course unit, the requirements for Area C of
the Core Curriculum and must both be completed to meet Area C requirements.
Students who begin Humanities I therefore make acommitment to take the entire
sequence.  Humanities I is a prerequisite for Humanities II.

? | **__REQUIRED TEXT AND MATERIALS_ :_**

For Humanities I:  Gloria Fiero, _TheHumanistic Tradition_ , 3rd ed., Vols.
1-3  
_Student Study Guide for The Humanistic Tradition_ , Vol. 1

For Humanities II:  Gloria Fiero, _TheHumanistic Tradition_ , 3rd ed., Vols.
4-6  
_Student Study Guide for The Humanistic Tradition_ , Vol. 2  
  
? | **__CLASS FORMAT; ATTENDANCE POLICY_ :_** Classes will include both large-
group lecture sessions and small-group discussions(see course schedule).
Students are expected to attend class each day,having studied the text
material relating to the lecture that day and having reviewed material from
the previous day's lecture and discussion. Although attendance will not be
regularly taken during large-group sessions, itwill have an impact on your
grade in several different ways. First, you will be responsible for all
material presented in class, whether or not you are in attendance (if you are
sick, you should check with another student for that day's notes). Students
who regularly attend will be rewarded not only with greater knowledge and
wisdom, but also with points from pop quizzes that cannot be made up if you
are absent that day. Credit for small-group assignments will be reduced by one
letter grade if you are absent for one of the small-group discussions relating
to the assignment and by two letter grades if you are absent both days. Late
assignments will also be penalized one letter grade per day late.  
? | **__EXAMINATIONS; MAKEUP EXAMINATION POLICY_ :_** Each examination will
consist of two parts, each counting 50% of the exam grade.The first portion
will consist of multiple choice questions, all taken from the unit of study
that was just completed. The second portion will include several essay
questions, taken from a larger list of questions that will be posted on the
course's web site a week or more prior to the test. Essay questions will focus
on material from the unit of study just completed, but may ask you to place it
in the context of earlier material. Students will be required to bring a
scantron (#2052) and a clean bluebook to each examination. Students who miss
one of the midterm examinations due to illness may take a makeup examination
on the last day of class, while the other students do a general review. **The
content of the special makeup examination will be comprehensive over _both_
midterms.**Students who miss both midterm examinations will receive an "F" in
the second one; no makeup is possible for the final examination.  
? | **__CALCULATION OF THE COURSE GRADE__ :**

Examinations (2 Midterms + Final, 20% each)50%

Written Assignments from Small-Group Sessions30%

Miscellaneous Assignments, Pop Quizzes,etc.20%

(letter grades on each exam and assignment will be averaged to calculate the
course grade in the same manner as you calculate your individual GPA: i.e., A=
4.0, A-=3.75, B+=3.25, B=3.0, etc.)  
? | **__STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSITY HONORS PROGRAM__   will be expected to
complete an additional project for credit in this course. Details will be
available from the course instructors.**

Thomson Small Group Assignment

First off, remember the policy stated above under class format/attendance
policy:  "Credit for small-group assignments will be reduced by one letter
grade if you are absent for one of the small-group discussions relating to the
assignment and by two letter grades if youare absent both days."

Here's the intriguing assignment due Feb.9.

Write a well-detailed essay (three paragraphs minimum but take what you need)
on **_one_** of the following topics:

1.  We have seen that the term "Baroque" is an especially slippery term in that it is a "catch-all" for a wide variety of art works from different perods and nationalities in art from 1630-1750.  Compare and contrast two Baroque works of art, with special attention tothat very important feature of Baroque art:  the contrasting of darkand light (you might want to use such technical terms as "chirascuro,""spotlighting," "silhouette," and, more generally, "tenebrism"). Be sure to draw conclusions about the significance of the similaritiesand/or differences that your essay discusses.

2.  Choose a work of art the Fierotext considers a "Baroque" work of art and **_argue_** againstits classification as such.   For this topic, examine closely yourdescriptive terms for the Baroque and then consider how the work you havechosen does not quite fit the description.  What factors argue againstit fitting tidily under the descriptive term "Baroque?"

You can wow me by looking at "Baroque" works of art that go beyond what we
have covered in class:  these are easily available on the internet--for
example check out  the Web Museum's [gallery of paintings
.](http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/)

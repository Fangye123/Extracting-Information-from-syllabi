**_Required texts_ :**

1.  Roy Matthews and F. Dewitt Platt, _The Western Humanities, Vol. 2: The Renaissance to the Present_ (4th edition)   
2.  Roy Matthews & F. Dewitt Platt, _Readings in the Western Humanities, Vol. 2_ (4th edition)   


**_Course Description_ :**

     This course will track the development of the arts & ideas of Western Culture from the Italian Renaissance of the 15th century to our contemporary world in the year 2002.  Discussion of history, politics, philosophy, science, and religion will form the background for an examination of the artistic, architectural, literary, theatrical, and musical heritage belonging to contemporary Western societies such as our own. 

**_Course objectives_ :**

     Among the specific objectives are: to acquire a familiarity with the breadth and depth of the Western cultural heritage and an appreciation for the connections with our own aesthetic and ideological conditions, both societally and individually; to learn basic concepts important to the study of culture, their uses and implementation; and to gain skill in the critical evaluation appropriate to this endeavor.  More general objectives include: to enhance and enlarge aesthetic and perceptual capacities; to improve critical thinking skills; to improve communication skills; and to stimulate creativity. 

**_Course requirements_ :**

     Students will be expected to be WELL PREPARED for class: to field questions concerning the assigned topics, and to engage in discussion.  **ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY:** more than three absences will count against the final grade, 2 points subtracted from your total raw score for each.   Students who miss more than 3 full weeks of classes (9 classes total) -- FOR ANY REASONS -- cannot be given a passing grade for this course. 

    There will be five in-class tests and no Final Exam.  NOTE WELL: Make-up tests will be scheduled only in cases of true emergency, and only for those students who provide legitimate documentation AND contact me NO LATER THAN the day of the test.  Do NOT come to me at the next class, or a week later, and say, "Dr. K, I missed the test.  Can I take a make-up?"  And do NOT just leave me a phone message, or an email message, and hope that I get back to you.  It is YOUR responsibility to talk with me directly.  ALL make-up tests will be given on the final day of class.  Given the extra time to prepare for them, they will be more difficult than the original versions.  Each test counts 20 percent of the final grade. 

    The grading scale, which I follow strictly, is as follows: 

A 92-100; A- 90-91; B+ 88-89; B 82-87; B- 80-81; C+ 78-79; C 72-77; C- 70-71;
D+ 68-69; D 60-67; F below 60.  


**_Schedule of classes_ :** Topics & primary text.  (Supplemental passages
from Matthews & Platt's _Readings in the Western Humanities_ will be announced
each class)

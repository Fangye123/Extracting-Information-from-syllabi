**Introduction**

In this course, we explore the origins and foundations of the American
republic. Building on a sound understanding of the Constitution, we will also
examine the status and health of representative government in America today.
Throughout, the focus will be on your role as a citizen and ways you can be
more informed and more effective.

**Online, Group-Based Problem Solving**

This course is a "hybrid" course. One of component of the course is very much
like every other course you have probably taken--traditional classroom-based
instruction and discussion. The balance of the course, however, is online. You
will be required to read additional materials, complete a variety of learning
activities and collaborate with other students to succeed in this part of the
course. These experiences are intended to provide you with additional
flexibility and control over your learning and to empower you as a citizen by
equipping you with the tools you need to be a well-informed and effective
participant in the political process.

This course is also different in another important way. Instead of lectures
and note-taking, this class is centered on [problem-based
learning](../../../Web%20Pages/Jon's%20Page/academia/319R/pbl.html).

Typically, this is how problem based learning works: Students confront a
problem. Individually or in groups, students organize prior knowledge and
attempt to identify the nature of the problem. Students pose questions about
what they do not understand. Students design a plan to solve the problem and
identify the resources they need. Students begin to gather information as they
work to solve the problem.

**Course Objectives**

By the end of the course, you should be able to do the following:

1\. Summarize the key themes, concepts and ideas that underlie the American
Founding. These include:

  * Popular sovereignty

  * Representation and a republican form of government

  * Separation of power
  * Federalism
  * Auxiliary precautions
  * The Founders' views on human nature and civic virtue 
  * The role of morality and religion in public life 

2\. Identify and critically analyze key institutions and processes in the
American political system. These include:

  * The Executive, Legislative and Judicial Branches of Government

  * Checks and Balances

  * The Legislative Process

  * Voting and Elections

  * Public Opinion 

3\. Explain your duties and responsibilties as a citizen and demonstrate your
ability to be informed to participate effectively in the American political
process.

**Policies**

_Late Work_

Late work will not be accepted unless you contact me before you miss a
deadline for an assignment or a test. If you contact me before an assignment
is due or before you are to take an exam and you have a reasonable excuse for
turning something in late or missing an exam, you will find that I am flexible
and accommodating. You must simply contact me before the assignment is due or
before the exam is scheduled to be taken.

_Academic Misconduct_

While all students sign the honor code, there are still specific skills most
students need to master over time in order to correctly cite sources,
especially in this new age of the Internet; as well as deal with the stress
and strain of college life without resorting to cheating. Please know that as
your professor I will notice instances of cheating on exams or plagiarizing on
papers. See http://www.byu.edu/honorcode for specific examples of intentional,
inadvertent plagiarism.

_Discrimination & Accomodation_

Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination
against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives
federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in
education. Title IX covers discrimination in programs, admissions, activities,
and student-to-student sexual harassment. BYU's policy against sexual
harassment extends not only to employees of the university but to students as
well. If you encounter unlawful sexual harassment or gender based
discrimination, please talk to your professor; contact the Equal Employment
Office at 378-5895 or 367-5689 (24 hours); or contact the Honor Code Office at
378-2847.

Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning
atmosphere which reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities.
If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this
course successfully, please contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities Office (378-2767). Reasonable academic accommodations are
reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services
are coordinated with the student and instructor by the SSD office. If you need
assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on
the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance
policy and procedures. You should contact the Equal Employment Office at
378-5895, D-282 ASB.

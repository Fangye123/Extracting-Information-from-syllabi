**Objectives:**  
The objectives of the class are to encourage you: (1) to write and speak
clearly about history, (2) to analyze logically the material you encounter,

(4) to utilize materials available in the library and on the internet.
Ultimately, I hope everyone leaves the class thrilled about history and filled
with a desire to learn more about the past.

Relevant Information: The rule of thumb is to spend two hours outside class
for every hour of class. Consequently you should expect to spend about six
hours a week in addition to class time for this course. Become familiar with
material from both the lectures and the reading assignments. If you have extra
time, read about subjects that hold a special interest for you. Avoid trying
to do an entire review the night before the examination. There is simply too
much material for this approach to work. Class attendance will not be a factor
in grading, except in the ways it affects your participation in discussion and
your written performance. However, class lectures are not covered in the
outside readings, and each student will be held responsible for knowing that
material.

ADA Statement: This University abides by the Americans with Disabilities Act
and Section 504 of the rehabilitation act of 1973, which stipulates that no
student shall be denied the benefits of an education "solely by reason of a
handicap." If you have a documented disability that may impact your work in
this class and for which you may require accommodations, please see the
instructor during the first week of class to arrange accommodations. In order
to receive accommodations, you must be registered with and provide
documentation of your disability to the Disability Services Office, which is
located in the Psychology Building, room 232.

If you need extra help during the semester, it is your responsibility to
contact me. I am pleased to offer extra help, but expect reciprocal commitment
on your part.

Suggestions for improvement of the class are always welcome.

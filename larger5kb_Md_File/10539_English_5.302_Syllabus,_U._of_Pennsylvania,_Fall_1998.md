## Course Description

What does it mean to be Asian American? In this class we will discuss works by
and about Asian Americans to examine what is at stake in this kind of
identification both historically and politically. We will begin by setting up
the framework for our exploration. How do we define the terms _Asian American,
politics, identity,_ and _identification_? How do we define _ethnicity_ and
_race_ , and how are these ideas related to Asian American identity? What is
the history of Asian Americans, and what is the history of _representations
of_ Asian Americans? After laying this initial groundwork, we will examine how
Asian Americans have represented themselves in four novels and several short
stories. We'll discuss how aspects of identity, such as gender, class, and
sexuality, relate to issues of ethnicity and race. We will also examine
different models of identity and how we might understand Asian American
identity in relation to them. Finally, in looking at these texts, we will
focus on what it means to be an Asian American writer and how issues of
language relate to how (not just what ) Asian Americans write. We'll conclude
the semester by talking about how the issue of globalization affects what it
means to be "Asian American" and what implications this might have for the
future.

By the end of this semester, I hope you'll have a good understanding of the
various issues involved in what it means to be an Asian American. More
importantly, however, I'd like to give you a sense of how your own lives, your
own identities relate to large societal structures and issues. To this end, in
discussing how Asian American writing relates to Asian American identity, I
hope you'll come to a better understanding of what it means for _you_ to be a
writer and how your writing relates to who _you_ are both personally and in
society at large. We'll be focusing on two major genres of writing, the
personal narrative and the critical essay, but we'll also "dabble" in other
forms of writing to give you a taste of the different circumstances in which
you may encounter writing in your future life and what those circumstances may
ask of you. I'll be asking you to think of writing as a _process_ , and we'll
be exploring what the steps of that process are. However, most importantly, I
hope that, by the end of this semester, you'll develop more of a sense of
ownership over your own writing, a sense of confidence in your own abilities
as a writer. I hope that you'll be able to develop a personal relationship to
your writing, so that not only can you respond well to any writing situation
you're placed in, but you'll also be able to feel writing as something
powerful, empowering, and even spiritual.

Listserv (Th 11/12): Think about the style of Mona in the Promised Land. Give

is trying to do by using this style.

Listserv (Tu 11/17): Contrast Mona in the Promised Land to the other novels

Listserv (Th 12/10): Think about our discussion about theory and practice,

learned this semester be applied as "activism"?

Weekly Writing Assignment #1 (F 9/18): 1) Do a 20-minute freewriting in
preparation for the following. 2) Write a 2-3 page personal narrative. You do
not have to write about something having to do with Asian American identity or
literature, but you should write about something that matters deeply to you,
something that you really care about, and you should be sure that your
narrative has an ultimate point that you are trying to convey. Be sure to stay
specific and concrete throughout. Bring in 4 copies for your peer review
group.

Weekly Writing Assignment #2 (M 9/28): 1) Do a 20-minute freewriting in
preparation for the following. 2) Write 2 pages about a loss that has affected
you emotionally. As Natalie Goldberg says on p. 21 of Bones, "Don't be
abstract. Write the real stuff. Be honest and detailed." See also pp. 41-47 of
Bones re: detail. Do not rationalize. Instead, describe what it felt/feels
like.

Weekly Writing Assignment #3 (M 10/5): 1) Do a 20-minute freewriting in
preparation for the following. 2) Write a 2-page personal narrative serving a
particular purpose that is not directly personal (e.g. as testimony in a court
case, in a history text trying to prove a certain poiint, in a letter to a
Congressperson).

Weekly Writing Assignment #4 (M 10/12): Pick a word in Nisei Daughter, No-No
Boy, or Woman Warrior. Look it up in the Oxford English Dictionary (the OED)
at <http://oed.library.upenn.edu>, and in 2 pages discuss how the various
meanings of the word reflect or enable what it is that the text is trying to
say. (No freewriting is due with this assignment, though you're welcome to do
it anyway.) Use the "single term searching" option, not just the "definition
only" option. Look at the various definitions, but also the examples of usage.
You might consider also the dates when various usages were common and the
etymology of the word.

Weekly Writing Assignment #5 (M 10/26): Interview an older member of your
family about his/her experiences as an Asian American (or as an Asian in
America if that's how s/he identifies him or herself). Pick one especially
interesting element as a focus, and write 2 pages either (1) analyzing this
interview in terms of larger societal issues or (2) about the experience of
doing the interview itself. If you choose (1), it will sound more objective,
more like a newspaper column (not the factual ones, but rather the "in-depth"
articles that analyze a situation). If you choose (2), it will be more like a
personal narrative. (See the Natalia Rachel Singer article.)

Weekly Writing Assignment #6 (M 11/2): Write a 1.5-2 page parody of a critical
essay.

Weekly Writing Assignment #7 (M 11/16): Give me a working thesis for Essay #3.
You should go through the process we did in class together to revise your
thesis a number of times before turning it in. If you want to work on Mona,
start reading _soon_!

Weekly Writing Assignment #8 (M 12/7): (1) Pick a topic/issue relating to
Asian Americans that is of interest to you (e.g. Filipino American women's
issues, job discrimination against recent immigrants in Silicon Valley, etc.).
(2) Go to the Penn Library Homepage at <http://www.library.upenn.edu> and
start up LEXIS/NEXIS (located under databases from the main homepage). (3)
Select the "General News" category, and find any articles on your subject in
what LEXIS/NEXIS considers "major newspapers" in the last six months. (4)
Compile a bibliography of the articles that you find (eliminate duplicates due
to the same article appearing in different editions of the same newspaper).
Make sure to use MLA format to cite your articles. (5) Select three articles
to read (and make them significant or important ones; don't make them cheesy
little teeny ones). (6) Find the address of your congressperson, and write a
1.5-2 page (double-spaced) letter to that person about this issue. Be sure to
have a "thesis" (a focus, a point) to your letter. (I.e. make sure it's clear
to the congressperson what the purpose of your letter is.) (7) Print up a
single-spaced version of the letter, and mail it.

Essay #1 (F 10/2, 4pm): Starting _from scratch_ , take the best element in
Weekly Assignment #1 and use that as your starting point to write a 2-3 page
personal narrative. Turn in Assignment #1 with Essay #1. What I'm asking you
to do is reconceptualize Assignment #1. This is a "revision" in the sense of
revisionging: rethinking the fundamental assumptions, goals, organizational
principles, etc. behind Assignment #1 to make large conceptual leaps rather
than merely minor changes.

Essay #2 (F 10/23, 4pm): Write a 3-4 page critical essay on Nisei Daughter or
Woman Warrior. (If you want to work on No-No Boy, you must see me first and
get it approved.) By "critical essay," I mean do a literary "close reading" of
the text. (Your "research" here is your close analysis of the text.) Turn in a
20-minute freewriting and 1 copy of your essay to me. You'll also need 3 or 4
copies (depending on how large your peer review group is) for the other
members of your peer review group, due the following Tues., 10/27.

Essay #3 (F 11/20, 4pm): Write a 5-page critical essay on either Native
Speaker or Mona in the Promised Land. See Weekly Writing Assignment #7.
Remember to do a 20-minute freewriting beforehand, and you'll need 3 or 4
copies for your peer review group, due the following Tuesday.

## Requirements

### Reading Preparation

In terms of reading preparation, you'll need to do two things before you come
to class each day:

  * Read the assigned texts (or viewing the assigned film) at least once and be prepared to discuss them in class 
  * Read all of the listserv postings and be prepared to respond to them in class 

### Class Participation

In this class I hope that you will learn as much from one another as you will
from me. To that end, active class participation is a must. How can you
participate? By asking questions, by sharing your thoughts, by listening
carefully to others in the class, and by responding thoughtfully to the ideas
they present. I want this place to be a safe space where you can try out new
ideas and where we can all experiment and take risks in our thinking. If you
find it difficult to speak up in large groups, you might try jotting down your
questions and ideas as your read and then referring to them in class. You can
also use the course listserv to continue class discussions and to raise issues
that we didn't get a chance to address in class.

### Email Listserv Postings

**You must have an email account to participate in this class!** I'll be
splitting the class into two groups, a Tuesday group and a Thursday group.
Half of the class will be responsible for posting to the class listserv by 6
PM the day before each class meeting. Often I'll ask you to post your thoughts
about the assigned texts. Sometimes my listserv questions will be more
directed. Listserv postings should be no more than 300 words, and you should
read everyone's postings and come to class prepared to discuss them.

### Reading Journal

You'll need to buy a journal or some kind of notebook for this class. As you
read, jot down what interests you about the text, any questions you have, how
you feel about the reading, and any other responses you may have. You should
write approximately one handwritten page before each class period. Then bring
your journal with you to class and take notes on class discussion in the same
journal. I'll be spot-checking these journals at random, unannounced
intervals, so _you must bring your journal with you to class every day!_

### Weekly Writing Assignments

Every week I'll ask you to do some kind of short writing assignment, usually
no longer than two pages typed, double-spaced. I'll expect these to be turned
into my mailbox no later than 4 P.M. every Monday. (The only exception to this
is the first assignment, which will be longer and due on a Friday instead.)
Sometimes these assignments will require some additional research or work
before you'll be able to write them. (For example, you might be asked to do an
electronic search in a particular library database.) My goal for these
assignments is (a.) to give you lots of practice writing, (b.) to expose you
to different genres and styles of writing, and (c.) to help you learn some
skills (such as research) that are not directly related to writing but are
often the prerequisites of good writing.

### Workshop Writing Assignments

Occasionally I'll ask you to do some kind of short writing assignment for an
in-class workshop (a thesis statement exercise, for example). It's important
that you complete these assignments thoughtfully and on time, since your
ability to participate and get something out of class on these days will be
determined by how well you've completed these assignments. Some workshops may
also involve writing that you'll do in class.

### Peer Review

One good way of improving your writing is by getting as much feedback as you
can. For each of your essays, you'll be receiving feedback from your peers as
well as from me. You'll also be learning how to give feedback to other people.
We'll practice first by doing a model peer review workshop and then breaking
up into smaller groups. We will be doing three peer review sessions this
semester, in addition to the model peer review workshop.

### Essays

You'll be writing three essays for this course that will become finished
products: one personal narrative and two critical essays. For each essay I'll
ask you to do four things: (1) a 20-minute freewriting exercise, (2) a graded
first version turned in on the due date, (3) as many ungraded revisions as you
like, and (4) a graded final version turned in at the end of the semester in
your portfolio. Since this class believes in writing as an ongoing process,
I'll be giving you comments that are geared toward further revision. We'll be
talking about your essays during individual conferences both before you turn
in your first version (so you'll have a chance to discuss your ideas with me
ahead of time) and after your first version (so you'll be able to get verbal
as well as written feedback from me in preparation for your revisions).

### Portfolio

At the end of the semester, I'll ask you to turn in a portfolio of all your
written work. (I'll give you more directions about this as the time
approaches.) Your portfolio will include (1) your reading journal, (2) your
weekly writing assignments, (3) your workshop writing assignments, and (4) a
packet for each of your essays that will include your freewriting, the first
graded version, the peer reviewed version, any interim revisions, and the
final version of each of your three essays. I'll ask you to mark any changes
from revision to revision by using a highlighter pen on the sections that have
been changed. In many cases, your essay may change completely from one version
to the next. In these cases, you'll want to just draw a box around each page
with your highlighter pen.

### Individual Conferences

I'll be scheduling five individual conferences with each of you outside of
regular class times. Each conference will last approximately 15 minutes, but I
encourage you to let me know if you would like to schedule an appointment in
addition to these meetings or if you would like to have a longer conference.
(To compensate for this extra time outside of regular class meetings, a couple
of the regular class sessions may be canceled.) These conferences are meant to
give us a chance to talk one-on-one about any questions you have about your
writing or the class in general. They will also give me a chance to help you
with upcoming papers before they're due and to give you more feedback on
previous papers prior to revision. I encourage you to jot down questions or
issues you would like to discuss prior to each conference and bring your list
with you, so that I can make sure to address whatever is most important to
_you_.

## Policies

### Grading

  * Letter-graded written work 50% 
  * Other written assignments 25% 
  * Participation and preparation 25% 
Any penalty for attendance problems will be deducted from this total.

Reading preparation and class participation constitute the "Participation and
Preparation" part of your grade.

Email listserv postings, your reading journal, your weekly writing
assignments, your workshop writing assignments, and your peer reviews of
others people's papers are all a part of the "Other written assignments"
grade. These assignments are graded on a done/note done basis, rather than
given a letter grade. (If you don't do them, though, your grade will suffer.)

To determine the portion of your grade devoted to letter-graded written work,
I'll be averaging the first and last versions of each of your essays to get a
"final" grade for each of the essays. Then I'll be averaging all of these
"final" grades together to arrive at your overall grade for this portion of
your grade for the course. In determining this portion of your final course
grade, I'll also be taking into account your improvement over the course of
the semester. (So, for example, if your initial grades on Essays #1, 2 and 3
are C+, B, and A-, respectively, and the grades on the last versions of each
of those essays are B, B+, and A, respectively, then the "final" averaged
grade would be B- for Essay #1, B/B+ for Essay #2, and A-/A for Essay #3.
These "final" grades for each essay would then be averaged together to
determine the portion of your course grade devoted to letter-graded written
work. B-, B/B+, and A-/A would average out to somewhere between a B/B+ and a
B+. Taking improvement into account, I'd bump it up to a B+.)

### Attendance

**Attendance is very, very, very, very important!** This is a
discussion/workshop based class, so without you there is no class. You may
miss one class meeting without penalty, but you must attend all other class
meetings unless you have obtained my permission _in advance_ or can document a
medical or family crisis after the event. Attendance is also required at each
of the individual conferences scheduled with me outside of regular class
times. Students with 1 unexcused absence will be graded a third of a grade
lower for the course (for example, a B+ gets lowered to a B); students with 2
unexcused absences will be graded two-thirds of a grade lower for the course
(a B+ becomes a B-); students with 3 unexcused absences will be graded a full
grade lower for the course (a B+ becomes a C+); students with more than 3
unexcused absences will fail the course. _Frequent tardiness will also affect
your grade,_ so be here and be on time.

### Late Papers

Because we'll be doing so much writing and because we're on a tight schedule
that involves peer review and multiple drafts of each paper, it's important
that you turn your papers in on time. Unless you have a documentable medical
excuse or a family crisis or I have given you an extension _in advance_ ,
papers that are submitted after the due date but before or at the next class
meeting will be marked down one-third of grade. Papers submitted later than
that will be marked down one-third grade for every subsequent class meeting.
_Extensions will only be considered if requested at least one class meeting in
advance of the due date._

### Collaborative Writing/Plagiarism

I encourage you to work with one another to become better writers and better
thinkers by sharing your ideas and giving feedback on each other's work.
However, the work you submit to this class is expected to be your own. When
you want to refer to someone else's ideas (even the ideas of someone else in
this class), you _must_ properly acknowledge your sources. Sometimes this
involves providing appropriate citations in the body of your writing and
additional bibliographic information at the end. Other times it involves using
footnotes correctly. If you have questions about how to cite a source
properly, consult a style manual or ask me. If you submit work that has been
copied without attribution from some published or unpublished source, or that
has been prepared by someone other than you, or that in any other way
misrepresents somebody else's work as your own, you will face severe
discipline by the University! Work that is your own work but has been
submitted to more than one class for credit is also considered plagiarism
unless you have obtained the permission of all course instructors involved
prior to handing in the work. For more detailed information, see the College
of Arts and Sciences' pages on academic integrity at
<http://www.sas.upenn.edu/college/rules/academic_integrity.html>.

###  Teaching

Econ 1060: The Political Economy of Race, Ethnicity, Gender, and Class (cross
listed as Women's Studies 106)      This course examines economic inequality,
across classes and across demographic groups, in the United States. We
consider a variety of economic analyses of these forms of inequality,
including those of the neoclassical and "political economy" schools. A primary
purpose of the course is to examine inequality locally, in Utah and Salt Lake
City. This course fulfills the university's "diversity requirement."

Econ 1740: US Economic History      This class is a broad survey of US
economic history from colonial times to the present day. Issues relating to
social history, labor markets, and inequality are especially emphasized. The
course fulfills the "American Institutions" requirement. It is designed to
appeal to individuals who have no experience studying economics.

Econ 3100: Labor Economics      This class introduces students to many of the
primary tools and topics of the economic analysis of labor markets. The
primary focus is on neoclassical theory, but other approaches are examined.

Econ 5140: Discrimination in Labor Markets      This class examines the
various models that economists have used to study the problem of labor market
discrimination. It also examines the evidence regarding discrimination and
evaluates the various models in light of this evidence. Antidiscrimination
policy is also discussed. While racial (black/white) and gender inequality are
given primary emphasis, students will be able to study other topics through
independent research projects. Students are expected to have taken Econ 201
and Econ 202 before enrolling. This course fulfills the university's
"Diversity Requirement." To see the web page for this course for Spring 2001,

Econ 5470: Industrialization and Development: The American Case      This
course covers the emergence of an industrial economy in the US from the early
19th century through the present day. Topics which receive particular emphasis
include technological change, change in the standard of living, demographic
changes related to industrialization, and gender and ethnic inequality. This
course fulfills the upper-division communication/writing requirement.

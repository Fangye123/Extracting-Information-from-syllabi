Graduate students are welcome to register for R credit, but not for E credit.  
  
**Paper**  
     Each student will write a paper of ten to twelve pages, comparing two works of history dealing with the same general subject. The paper should analyze and compare the approach, use of evidence, and overall interpretation and conclusions of the three works (rather than simply summarizing their arguments.) It should judge how well each author succeeds in what he or she sets out to do, and indicate which of the works you find most persuasive, and why. The paper is due at the ta sections during the week of April 24. Below is a list of significant works from which to choose, organized by subject. Those who wish to write on other topics or books should speak to me, or to your discussion section leader, as should those seeking guidance on choosing topics and books. I have not included studies of specific individuals, but it is perfectly acceptable to compare, for example, two biographies of Andrew Jackson or Frederick Douglass.

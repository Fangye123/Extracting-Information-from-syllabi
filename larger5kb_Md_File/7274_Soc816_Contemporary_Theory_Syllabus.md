_**RESPONSIBILITIES:**_

There is a lot of work to do in this seminar - for all of us.  
  
---  
  
**_FIRST:_**

Each one of you will be responsible for providing a critical overview (~3-4
pages) of the readings for one Tuesday during the semester -- to which every
other member of the seminar will then respond (1-2 pages).

The initial " **Commentique** " is due **Monday at 6pm** and the **Responses**
are due **Wednesday at 6pm**. This will allow us to have a shared and evolving
series of questions and perspectives BEFORE the seminar. This way I do not
wholly set the agenda and the conversation is already started before we
gather.

This process will be executed using the university's WebTalk software. This
program can be found at: [http://clcgi.cl.msu.edu/~rudya/cgi-
bin/soc816/webtalk/system](http://clcgi.cl.msu.edu/%7Erudya/cgi-
bin/soc816/webtalk/system)

We will review the software on the first day of the seminar it is very simple
to use. There are **Topics** \-- one for each week -- and there will be
triplets of **Conversations** \-- one for the _commentique_ , one for the
_responses_ , and one for my _summation_. The central expectation is that
everyone in the room will have read the readings as well as the WebTalk
"Conversations" __**before**__ class. Again, the goal is to reduce the amount
of silence we experience and prodding I have to do. We will collectively set
the agenda for the session at the beginning of each meeting.  
  
**_SECOND:_**

Because of the relative shortfall in theorists from "the South" included in
the syllabus, each of you will be required to write a final paper on such a
person. Defining the range and in/exclusiveness of the category will be
interesting, I'm sure.

I will require

  1. a decision on a theorist, and peer review partner, by the first session after Spring Break (3/15/01), 
  2. an outline of the paper, with a general thesis statement, by 4/5/01,
  3. a draft for peer review by Monday 4/23/01,
  4. and a review by class time on Thursday 4/26/01.

The papers will be due the Thursday of Exam week (5/3/01).

**_EXPECTATIONS:_**

**You cannot do well in this class unless you are actively engaged in the
seminar. Nevertheless, I am fully cognizant that some folks participate orally
more than others do. For those who speak less often in the seminar, your
weekly written work will be of additional importance. The majority of your
grades will come from the weekly papers, the research paper, and seminar
participation. There is no absolute formula for grades, among other things
improvement over the semester can and will count for a lot - though this is
NOT advice to do shoddy work at the start.**

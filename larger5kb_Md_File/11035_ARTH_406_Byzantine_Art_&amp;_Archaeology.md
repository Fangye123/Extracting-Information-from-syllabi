assignments are associated directly with visual material on the class Web
site. All students are expected to digest all of the readings and to submit
all assignments. Class attendance is essential. Absences will be reflected in
the final grade for the class. All readings are on reserve in notebooks
labelled "ARTH 406" in the [ Art

Grading:

Grades will be based on assignments, both take home and in class. Class
participation is considered essential. The three "at-home" assignments will
constitute 60% of the grade. Assignments completed in class will form 30% of
the grade (absorption of the required readings will be essential in order to
complete these assignments). The remaining 10% will be based on participation
in discussion.

Write a thoughtful, cohesive essay re: your chosen film, addressing some of
the questions on the reverse that you feel are most appropriate to your film.
Please emphasize your own personal reactions to specific issues/scenes in the
film. Please don't simply tell me what you think I want to hear, and don't
worry about offending me. I really want some gut-level reactions here!

Category One: Does this film seem to have a particular point of view regarding
the role of women, both in society at large and in their interpersonal
relationships with men? How is it displayed? Is the dominant sensibility or
culture portrayed in the film patriarchal or matriarchal ? How are the
relationships between women portrayed as being the same or different from the
traditional portrayal in movies of relationships between women and men? If you
are heterosexual yourself, what do you find intriguing/different/universal/
offputting/etc. re: the relationships between women in the film? Do you feel
you learned anything of value, or did the movie make you uncomfortable, and
why? If you are gay or lesbian, what rings true for you personally? What seems
contrived?

Category Two: In what ways are the major gay characters in the film like or
unlike yourself or people you know? Do you feel the movie provides a realistic
portrayal of a gay "culture" that extends beyond mere sex? Several of these
films deal with a common theme of alienation/heterosexual prejudice. If these
ideas are depicted in your chosen film, do you think they're realistically
portrayed? Why or why not? Do the experiences of one or more of the characters
in the film make you think in a new way about how life and relationships may
be more challenging for gay people than for heterosexuals? Did you learn
anything of value? Gain a new perspective? Ever feel uncomfortable? Why? What
rings true or seems contrived?

Category Three: Most of the questions above apply. In addition to these, what
other challenges are faced by HIV+ characters, as well as HIV- characters who
are forced to deal with HIV less directly? Do you feel that your chosen film
may have served a purpose in educating an audience at a time when AIDS issues
were less understood in our society? How might this film help to heal the
wounds of those effected by HIV/AIDS?

HUM 210 PAPER #4: A-Z. Two pages. Handwritten papers and papers without
folders will not be accepted. Your folder should also contain papers #1 - #3.
DUE R 4/12

  1. Base your paper on Antonia's Line or choose one of the following for extra credit points: 

_Xiu Xiu_ ; The Sent-Down Girl (+7)  
(China/USA 1999; Joan Chen)

_Girlfight_ (+3.5)  
(USA 2000; Karyn Kusama)

_Love and Basketball_ (+3.5)  
(USA 2000; Gina Prince Bythewood)  
_Love and Basketball_ may be chosen only if not previously chosen for paper
#3.

  2. Write a well-developed and thoughtful essay discussing your reactions to this film. Consider some or all of the following: 
    1. Does this film seem to have a particular point of view regarding the role of women, both in society at large and in their interpersonal relationships? How is it displayed?
    2. In your opinion, does this film make a feminist statement? What is feminism to you, and how is it manifested in the film's message? 
    3. How are relationships between the sexes portrayed as being similar or different from the traditional portrayal in movies? 
    4. Are the male characters portrayed differently than what you are used to seeing in more mainstream Hollywood fare? 
    5. How would this movie be different if a man had directed it? Would it have been made at all?
    6. In all three films the female protagonist meets with rejection because of her failure to conform to a traditional female role. How would you respond to this character if you met her? How do you feel about the portrayal of women in traditionally masculine roles? 

Please use specific examples from the film to support your assertions. over ->

OR...

Paper #4 Plan B: re: Antonia's Line

Two pages typed, in a folder with papers #1-#3. Due R 4/12  
This option worth 3.5 extra credit points.

  1. Read the reviews by Guthmann and McAlister. Consider what each has to say about Antonia's Line. Choose one review with which you agree and one with which you disagree.
  2. Develop a position paper in support of either the views of Guthmann or the views of McAlister. In supporting your position, make direct reference to both reviews as well as to the film. Quote the reviewers and cite specific examples from the film to support your assertion that Antonia's Line is either "a lovely film with great feminist and humanist values" (McAlister), or "an odd mix of schmaltz and anti-male orneriness" (Guthmann). 

HUM 210 PAPER ASSIGNMENT #2: Two page minimum, typed. Due R 2/15 in a two-
pocket folder. Handwritten papers and papers without folders will not be
accepted. Folder should include paper #1.

  1. Read Chapters One thru Three in the textbook. 
  2. Rent and view either Red (+5) or Twin Falls Idaho. 
  3. Referring to the text for guidance, write three well-developed paragraphs, one answering each of the following about one of the films: 

For Red:

    1. What, in your opinion, is a major theme of the film? State the theme in a single sentence, then develop a substantial paragraph explaining your opinion. Use examples from the film to support your case. 
    2. What is your opinion of the symbolism inherent in the use of the color red in the film? What meanings seem to be attached? What is the director saying thru the dramatic use of red? Which characters seem to be closely associated with red and why? Use specific examples to support your ideas. 
    3. What is your interpretation of the broken glass motif and its possible meanings? Use examples to support the development of a complete paragraph. 

or...

For Twin Falls Idaho:

  1. What, in your opinion, is a major theme of the film? State the theme in a single sentence, then develop a substantial paragraph explaining your opinion. Use examples from the film to support your case. 
  2. Identify and explain at least two of the major symbols/metaphors used to depict the plight of the twins in the film. Does the presence of these symbols/ metaphors enhance your emotional response to their situation? How? 
  3. In what ways do you feel irony is present in the film? Is there at least one example you can relate that depicts either Dramatic Irony, Irony of Situation, of Character, Setting, Tone, etc? Be specific in developing a complete paragraph. 

As with all of your papers this semester, I am less concerned with "right" vs.
"wrong" answers than I am with your ability to think critically and interpret
beneath the surfaces of things. No answer is "wrong" as long as it is fully
supported with specific examples and valid reasoning. Red presents the greater
challenge, I believe, and papers will be graded accordingly.

_Difficulties and Successes I've Had:_

Student response was overwhelmingly (almost entirely) positive.

This has been a valuable and rewarding experience for myself and for my
students. The only real danger I've encountered has been the possibility of
doing a disservice to each diverse community by trying to cover too many
topics in too little time. Spending only one class period on Gay/Lesbian
perspectives or two classes on African American perspectives is better than
not teaching them at all, but at times I worried that in my desire to give
breadth to the diversity issue I may have disrespected some populations by
having to present complicated, worthy issues in an overly-simplified,
truncated fashion. Really wish I had more time to do justice to all!

COMMENTS COMPILED FROM STUDENT EVALUATIONS:

100% of respondents said they would recommend this course, as taught by this
teacher, to friends.

Loved the world-wide array of films. I never would have seen some of this
stuff, but I'm glad I did.

I found all the diversity topics valuable because they were things I hadn't
observed before. Being a film major, a background in world film history helps
me to open my mind to different concepts and styles.

Most valuable was female/feminist!!! Power to the women! It's good to show men
things that they might not usually see.

I learned that all of these topics were valuable (and enjoyable). Of course
there are always certain topics that make you feel sick (like people getting
beat-up), but that's what makes them valuable. All of the diverse topics
covered taught me a lot about the human race around the world.

I thought the African-American topic was most valuable, or the gay/lesbian.
They challenge people's minds for equality. That is something that always
needs to be addressed.

I especially appreciated the feminist and the gay/lesbian topics, just because
they are avery day issues that we encounter often. I believe most people are
somewhat complacent when they need to be the opposite. I appreciated covering
these topics because it brings them to people's attention and HOPEFULLY
inspires them to think and grow.

I particularly enjoyed the weeks spent on China and gay/lesbian perspectives.
I thought they were interesting and very informative.

I found the Chinese films to be the most interesting. Neorealism and magic
realism were also very enjoyable topics. I found the feminist topic
interesting but less valuable.

I've always been a pretty anti any-movie-that-is-in-a-different-language kind
of person, but watching clips in class made me get off my ass and go see
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, which was definitely a good thing. The paper I
liked least was the African-American paper. Maybe it was the movie (probably),
but that was the only thing I did not enjoy doing.

I found gay/lesbian most valuable because I know several gay people who I love
very much and they need to be represented more often as the kind of people
they are. I enjoyed learning about China but it just didn't hit as close to
home, literally or figuratively.

It isn't that I didn't enjoy the China thing, but it felt like it went on too
long. I was hoping for another day to be spent on the gay/lesbian.

I am definitely leaving this course enriched.

Some subjects like African-Americans in film were too broad and seemed rushed.
I would have been better if you had narrowed the focus more. China I loved and
got a lot out of.

_Syllabus / Course Outline:_

HUMANITIES 210: CONTEMPORARY CINEMA  
INSTRUCTOR: DARRELL COPP  
OFFICE HOURS: MWF 11:30-12:30, TR 9-10  
OFFICE: LC-331  
PHONE: 423-6357  
TEXT: _The Art of Watching Films 5thh ed._ Boggs/Petrie.

COURSE DESCRIPTION: In this course we will study contemporary films and the
people who make them. Film as an interdisciplinary art form is explored in two
ways: 1) We will isolate each of the elements that make a film. 2) We will
explore the many ways in which film enriches and educates audiences through
the evocation of various points of view, cultures, and lifestyles. This
semester you will be exposed to Film through diverse, multicultural
perspectives.

DISCLAIMER: Films and clips depicting adult subject matter, sexuality,
violence, drug use and explicit language will be shown. Your continued
attendance in this course beyond the first day indicates your willingness to
be exposed to these and other subjects and to deal with them in a mature and
open-minded manner.

COURSE OBJECTIVES AND OUTCOMES:

  1. To recognize film's influence on contemporary communication processes. 
  2. To enhance perception in the process of viewing films, and to develop critical skills in evaluating film as an art form. 
  3. To identify and use film terminology correctly. 
  4. To raise questions regarding values stimulated by film 
  5. To identify some of the major figures who have made great contributions to Contemporary Cinema.
  6. To learn how the medium of Film can enhance our lives by showing us ways of life that are different from our own. 

ATTENDANCE: I don't want no scrubs! A scrub is a fool who can't get no "A"
from me! Attendance is required because the majority of the material covered
will be seen, discussed, and evaluated during class. Because of the nature of
the class, there will be no make-up of any missed course material,
assignments, or in-class presentations. Your attendance and participation are
an important part of your final grade. Each student is allowed two free
absences. You will lose 10 points from your final grade for a third absence,
10 more for a fourth. If you are absent more than four times you will be
dropped from the course. This includes absences of any kind, for any reason.
Attendance will be taken every day at the beginning of class. If you arrive
after attendance has been taken, it is your responsibility to make sure I have
noted your arrival in my book. Arriving late will cost you one half-absence (5
points), as will leaving early. The Final Exam period for this class is on R
5/17. Failure to attend class on that day will result in a "0" attendance
grade for the entire course.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

It is necessary for every student to own/have access to a VCR (a DVD player
would help, but is not necessary). Additionally, you must have the financial
means to bear the cost of renting a number of videos and attending at least
three theatrically-screened over the course of the semester.

480 - 539 = B  
420 - 479 = C  
360 - 419 = D  
<360 = F

EXTRA CREDIT: There are many opportunities for extra credit in this course.
For each assignment you will have a choice of films to view. Films listed with
a "(+5)" beside the title are worth 5 points more than the other choices for
that particular assignment. Choosing the "(+5)" films can really add-up over
the course of the semester. You will also have the opportunity to write an
extra 50 point paper at the end of the course which will replace your lowest
50 point grade.

PAPER REQUIREMENTS: Length of papers as listed for each assignment is a
minimum requirement, based on 12-point type, double-spaced, with 1 1/4"
margins, not including a separate title page. Any paper not meeting the
minimum length requirements will be penalized. Papers that are not typed will
not be accepted All papers will be presented in a two-pocket folder. Over the
course of the semester your papers will accumulate in this folder so that I
may assess your progress from one paper to the next.

PLAGIARISM: Representing the work of others as your own constitutes grounds
for failing this course. NEVER use ANYTHING written by ANYONE else without
citing your source.

LATE ASSIGNMENTS: Late papers are accepted at a penalty of 10% per calendar
day. Papers are due at class time on assigned date. Papers arriving after
class has begun will be considered late. Presentations are due on the assigned
day and may not be made-up. Any student failing to present on his/her assigned
day will receive a grade of "0" for the assignment.

HELPFUL ADDRESSES: Over the course of the semester you may need to find one or
more videos that are unavailable at most major chains, such as Blockbuster.
The best place in the Valley to find older and foreign films is the Burton
Barr Phoenix Central Library, located on Central Avenue just South of
McDowell. Get a library card and videos can be borrowed free for one full
week. Perhaps the best selection of foreign and non-mainstream videos for rent
can be found at Movies on Central, also on Central Avenue just South of
Camelback. Scottsdale Video, on the Northeast corner of Thomas and 68th
Street, also has a better-than-average selection of older and foreign films.
For research purposes, the most logical website from which to begin is the
Internet Movie Database at us.imdb.com. Some other good websites for keeping
up with the movies include Roughcut.com, ain't-it-cool-news.com, Film.com, and
Inside.com.

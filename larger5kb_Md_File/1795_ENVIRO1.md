**_Class Description_**

Taken in consecutive semesters and taught by the same team of instructors,
History/Political Science 15A/B fulfills the state of California's American
Institutions and Ideals code requirements for US History, US Constitution, and
California Government. When successfully completed, History/Political Science
15A/B counts for six units of General education requirements in Social
Sciences and Comparative Systems. Keep in mind that you must complete the
entire two-semester sequence in order to fulfill these requirements. Either
semester alone will satisfy none of these requirements. If you have already
taken Political Science 1 or Political Science 101, you may not take
History/Political Science 15A/B.

**_POLITICAL SCIENCE_**

__

The political science subject matter in this course has been designed as an
introduction to government through the study of political institutions in the
United States and California. A central component of the course deals with the
manner in which the government of the United States is now, and has been from
its inception, approaching a truly democratic system. We will devote
considerable attention to the political process as it has developed from
important underlying political theories to evolving and increasingly
democratic institutions. We will investigate the impact of social
participation in the United States and in California from a multicultural
perspective including the interaction between civil rights, civil liberties,
and linkage institutions. In so doing we will cover the development of public
opinion, gender relations, campaigns, campaign funding, interest groups, and
the process of policy formation and implementation. The course will encourage
critical thinking about these processes and their implications for the
American political system. In addition to the required readings, I will also
occasionally show videotapes that analyze and discuss political issues.
Students are responsible for reading, lectures, and all videotape material.

**_HISTORY_**

The historical components of this course cover the development of United
States history from Reconstruction to the present. There are of course many
topics, which can and will be covered in this class. They will range from
economics and politics to social movements, military history, and others.
However, the main emphasis will be to give the student a foundation of
information, including the basic facts and themes, which will allow him/her to
understand the important events in United States history and further his/her
studies with more in-depth investigations. We will be looking at the major
personalities, causes and affects, and historical facts which are relevant to
each major subject. We will also present both the conventional and alternative
interpretations of subjects whenever possible. Information will be presented
in a multicultural framework, including both conflict and consensus
perspectives of the choices and options available to individuals and groups in
their social, economic, and political relations. The focus will be on the
development of a multicultural society and the interactions, including
cooperation and conflict, as these many and varied peoples have dealt with
social, economic, and political issues.

**_STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES_**

You will learn to analyze current social and political events, relate them to
their historical precedents and recognize the individual roles played by the
many elements that make up our diverse society. Through diverse reading
assignments, the text, and lectures, you will learn about American history,
government, and institutions from the nation's beginnings to our present
society. By the end of the two-semester course, you should be able to
recognize the key events and issues that formed the nation and be able to
explain the interactive role of those events in producing today's political,
social, and economic problems and institutions. Because History/Political
Science 15 A/B involves multidisciplinary material you will learn to draw from
a wide spectrum of sources for information and apply that information to
current political, economic, and social situations.

**Methods of Evaluation:**

Quizzes - 25%  
Midterm - 25% (March 17th)  
Paper - 25% (Due May 5th)  
Final - 25% (May 24th)

**Examinations**

Each examination will consist of two essay questions randomly chosen from a
list of four that will be distributed one week prior to the examination.
Quizzes will be in a variable format. You will take twelve quizzes - we will
drop the lowest two quiz scores. Examinations will cover readings, lectures,
and videotaped material. Any student that engages in an act of Academic
Dishonesty will receive an "F" for the course and will be referred to the
appropriate campus official (see pp. 446, 447 catalogue). Students must take
examinations on the day they are scheduled. No makeup examinations will be
administered without compelling medical reasons and documentation. Crises, if
they occur, must be communicated to the professor before the examination.
Makeups are not a right, they are a privilege.

**Paper**

The paper will be a 6-8 page critical analysis, argument, or discussion based
upon the presidential primary process in this country. A detailed description
of the required elements will be distributed in class. Any student may bring
rough drafts of their paper to the instructors and receive detailed feedback -
rough drafts must be dropped off in class at least one week prior to the date
the paper is due - and will be discussed during office hours or by appointment
with either instructor.

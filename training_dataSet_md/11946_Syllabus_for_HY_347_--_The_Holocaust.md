## THE HOLOCAUST

This course introduces students to Nazi Germany's systematic mass murder of
Jews in Europe during the Second World War. Topics to be covered in this
course include Jewish life in Europe prior to the 20th century; the origins of
the hatred of Jews, usually called antisemitism; the development of Social
Darwinist and National Socialist ideologies; the origins of Nazi racial
policies in the 1930s; Nazi eugenics and euthanasia campaigns; the war of
annihilation waged against Jews under Germany's control during World War II;
the mass murders of other groups during the war; Jewish resistance to the
Holocaust; and the help or lack thereof offered by non-Jews to mitigate the
Holocaust.

Class time will consist of primarily of (1) lectures with frequent pauses for
questions and dialogue; and (2) video presentations.

The choice of material presented in the course presupposes students have
satisfactorily completed the second half of the Western civilization survey
(History 102).

The course will be very intellectually and emotionally demanding; but the
reward will be great and you will never forget this experience.

**_Office Hours and Student-Professor Contact:_** My office hours are Monday
and Wednesday from 7:40 to 8:40 p.m. If these hours do not fit your schedule,
you should feel free to ask me for an appointment or to call one of the phone
numbers above. If I am not available when you call, please leave a message.

Please do not wait until catastrophes strike before phoning or coming to see
me outside of class. It would also be great to talk with you about the course
or anything else even when things are going well.

Those of you with access to electronic mail are strongly encouraged to e-mail
me at the address at the top of the syllabus. In many cases e-mail will prove
the fastest way to get a definitive answer from me. I will also welcome any
comments or suggestions you may wish to submit via e-mail.

**_Required Books:_** Students should purchase the four required texts.

> Ronnie S. Landau, _The Nazi Holocaust_  
>  Richard Glazar, _Trap with a Green Fence_  
>  Primo Levi, _Survival in Auschwitz_  
>  Sara Nomberg-Przytyk, _Auschwitz: True Tales from a Grotesque Land_

**_Grades:_** Your grade will be determined by one of the following sets of
percentages, according to your choice.

Midterm essay exam  
Final essay exam (non-comprehensive)  
Paper  
Class participation

| 35%

The difference between these two methods concerns your score on the midterm,
and your desire to improve it. If you do not perform as well as you would have
liked on the midterm, you may elect to take a comprehensive final exam that
will count for 55% of the course grade, thus lowering the weight of your
midterm exam to only 15%. If you are satisfied with your midterm grade, or if
you do not wish to take a comprehensive final exam, you may take a final that
covers only material since the midterm.

No extra credit assignments will be allowed. The standard grading scale will
be used on all work: A=90-100; B=80-89; C=70-79; D=60-69; F=below 60.

**_Class Participation and Attendance:_** Your attendance in class is
required. Each student may miss as much as one week's worth of class (200
minutes) without the need to provide any excuse, since it is assumed you will
be missing class for emergency purposes only. Subsequent absences will be
excused only for very serious illness or family emergencies. Students with
jobs should consider as the term begins whether their work and class schedules
are in harmony, and adjust them accordingly -- even if it means having to drop
this class.

Each twenty-five minutes of class time that students miss after the excused
period will result in a loss of one point of class participation credit, up to
the maximum of ten points. Thus, since each evening class is 100 minutes long,
missing an entire class after the excused period will cause a loss of four
points. Students who miss more than three weeks' worth of class for any reason
may be failed for the course.

Frequent verbal contributions of good quality may result in increased credit
for participation.

**_Midterm and Final Exams:_** Two in-class essay/short-answer exams will be
given: (1) the midterm exam will take place on Monday, February 9; (2) the
final will take place on Monday, March 16 at 6:00 p.m. The midterm will cover
topics raised prior to February 9; the final will cover topics raised since
the midterm, unless students elect to take a comprehensive final as discussed
above. More details -- especially concerning the material for which you will
be responsible on each exam -- will be announced verbally in class.

**_Paper Assignment:_** Each student will write a typed, ten-page fictional
first-person account by a victim of the Holocaust. The paper will be due
Wednesday, March 11 at the beginning of class. More details on the paper will
appear on a subsequent handout. Late papers will be marked down five points
per day or fraction thereof, up to a maximum of twenty points.

**_Attendance and Make-Ups:_** The University _Bulletin_ puts it the best: "An
individual student is responsible for attending the classes in which the
student is officially enrolled. The quality of work will ordinarily suffer
from excessive absences."

Students who miss the midterm exam and expect to make it up should present
written proof of extreme and unavoidable circumstances compelling the
student's absence at the specific time of the exam. Such excuses have a better
chance of being accepted if you call or e-mail me before you miss the exam. If
in doubt, call. I'll be glad to hear from you.

Remember: failing to attend class may adversely affect your class
participation grade.

**_Honesty:_** All the work you do in this course should be the product of
your own studying and thinking. For the exams in class, you may use only the
knowledge in your own heads. For the paper, you may use as sources only class
notes, course readings, selected films we have seen in class, and your own
imagination. I don't expect to have to do this, but I do reserve the right to
award an F for the entire course to any students who do not comply with these
standards of honesty. Do all your work yourself and you'll have no problem.
But, once again, if in doubt, call. I'll always be glad to hear from you.

**_Warning:_** Any information on this syllabus may be superseded by verbal
announcements in class. Please be here every time!

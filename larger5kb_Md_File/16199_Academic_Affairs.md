## Overview

Welcome to a survey of Western Civilization to 1789. In the course of the next
sixteen weeks we will be covering the development of Western Civilizations
from its origins in the Fertile Crescent, subsequent transformations as that
culture passed westward through ancient Greece and Rome, the changes wrought
during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the division of Christendom
following the Reformation, and the rise of secular ideologies up through the
eve of the French Revolution. In essence, we are going to dash across five or
six millennia in the comparative blink of an eye. We are also trying to
include more of the non-Western world in our narrative. Naturally, this means
that much material will receive only slight attention, and an even more
atrocious amount of information will be ignored completely. With that minimal
apology out of the way, I hope that you will find the class challenging,
informative, even occasionally entertaining.

Although you may indeed be at the mercy of this professor's editorial whim,
this does not mean students are sponges who should do no more than simply soak
up lectures and then have that same information wrung out of them during
exams. Even with a narrative as seemingly set as that of ancient and medieval
cultures, there is still much for room for differing interpretations, and this
course will strive to give students the opportunity (if not the obligation) to
choose (or manufacture) the one that strikes them as best. Obviously, then,
this class will ask you to think critically, weigh information for its worth
and relevancy, and build cogent, defensible opinions. The exams will be
looking for both your command of the historical record itself and evidence of
deeper analysis of the issues involved. While developing your understanding of
the material, feel free--be eager even--to question/challenge/verify the
interpretations presented by the instructor.

Let me re-emphasize the last sentence above: you will have to grapple with the
information presented in this class, not simply and only memorize it. I will
be asking you many questions throughout the semester; be ready to answer them.
On the other hand, "be not afraid." Oftentimes, there is not a decisively
correct answer, and I will simply be seeking to learn which conclusions you
have reached. Obviously, then, your participation in class matters and will
reflect your preparation.

  

## Grading and Assignments

_**Exams**_ : There will be three exams, of a form to be discussed later,
which will be weighted so as to give students the benefit of experience. Thus,
the first is worth 15%, the next one 20%, and the final exam 25% of the course
grade. While no test is cumulative, each is built on the assumption that you
actually remember material from previous exams. The make-up policy for missed
exams is as follows: if you know in advance that you will miss a test, see me
about the possibility of arranging an alternate test time. If an emergency
comes up which will not allow such advance planning, present me with some
token evidence (severed limbs are not necessary), and we will arrange
something. No one may miss the final; to miss it is to fail the course.

_**Quizzes**_ : At three fixed dates--and two surprise ones--in the semester,
I will give a small quiz (of the multiple choice and true/false variety)
designed to make certain that you have not become a zombie. The lowest of
those five grades will be jettisoned in the final computation of grades so
that the remaining four will be worth 10% of the final grade.

_**Book Review**_ : There will be two of these, hopefully (for your sake and
mine) no longer than three pages in length apiece. Each will be worth 15% of
your grade. For full details on the nature of this assignment, and the canon
of available choices, see the on-line guidelines at
<http://home.nwciowa.edu/~sisaac/Enfer/Trexler.htm> .

  

## Course goals

The goals (or should I say fruits?) of a history course are as numerous as the
books which historians produce. At the broadest level, though, historical
study encourages and hones critical analysis of the questions which most
concern us. And these issues are themselves countless, but in the most generic
terms, they most often center on the relations of people with one another,
with themselves, and with the supernatural. We will be asking "why?" rather a
lot. Why did they think that? Why did they assume such a thing? Why does the
past appear simultaneously alien and similar? Even as we ask these questions,
others lie implicitly underneath: why do I think what I think? What are my
prejudices and assumptions? How does a Judeo-Christian heritage sway my
conclusions?

Naturally, neither you nor I can know how increasingly critical your thinking
is becoming unless you express yourself. Thus, we encounter the final goal:
development of your writing skills. All three of your exams will have one
large essay. And there are the response papers. The book review, however, will
be the fullest opportunity both to stretch and demonstrate your ability to
express _**your**_ conclusions about historical events and historical
scholarship. I will post on my web site a selection of texts (all available
either at Ramaker Library or through me), from which you may choose. The
review should be three pages long (standard fonts and sizes). Therein, you
will need to: a) present the author's argument/thesis; b) summarize the
evidence used; and c) evaluate whether the author's argument is convincing. Do
not hesitate to disagree with a scholar if you think he/she has overlooked
important issues or evidence, misinterpreted information, or missed any
further opportunities to persuade you.

  

## Lecture and Reading Schedule

The three primary sources which you will read for this class each correspond
to one of the sections below, and to that section's concluding exam. I urge
you to read them at the times indicated below for the maximum benefit of
explanatory material. In addition, the reading assignments from Sherman and
Salisbury's _The West in the World_ (S &S) ought to be done before you come to
class. The information provided by that text will do much to color in the
background of the points I will be stressing in lecture.

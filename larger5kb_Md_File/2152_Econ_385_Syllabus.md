**Description.** This course will deal with primary and secondary education in
the United States. It will examine a variety of questions about the role of
education in the economy and about economic aspects of the educational system.
After some discussion of the problems of education in the U.S. and of their
connection to the economy, the course will turn to the historical development
of public education in the United States and to different theories that
purport to explain that development. A considerable portion of the course will
be devoted to particular controversies \-- for example: the issue of school
choice, merit pay for teachers, the equalizing or disequalizing impacts of
schooling, charter schools, the importance of education in making the U.S.
"more competitive." Students will be expected to draw on their own experiences
in addressing such questions as: does education make people more productive?
if so, how? does education affect people's behavior in ways that make them
"fit" better or worse in the large enterprises of the economy? whose interests
are served by the structure of our educational system? how does the
educational system affect economic, social and political equality?

**Requirements.** **Attendance is required.** Your course grade will be based
on class participation, a short paper, a term paper proposal, an in-class
exam, and a term paper. Information about each of these factors affecting your
grade is at the end of the syllabus. _Note especially the information about
late papers and term paper proposals._ Due dates and the role of each item in
determining your grade are as follows:

  | _Due Date_ | _Share of Grade_  
---|---|---  
Short paper | Thursday, March 1 | 20%  
Term paper proposal | April 10 | 10%  
In-class exam | April 26 | 25%  
Term paper | Due on Friday, May 18 | 45%  
  
**Office hours**. My office hours are 9:00 to 10:00 on Tuesday and Thursday. I
realize, however, that many people cannot meet me during my office hours. So
you can always call me or e-mail me (phone number and e-mail address above) or
catch me at class, and we can make an appointment. Also, I will usually be in
my office early in the afternoon on Tuesday and Thursday, and sometimes during
the middle of the day on Wednesday (as well as other random times during the
rest of the week).

**Note**. I do not accept papers or paper proposals by e-mail. You must supply
me with a hard copy.

**COURSE OUTLINE AND READING ASSIGNMENTS**

Classes will be based heavily on group discussion, and in order to take part
effectively in that discussion you will need to do as much of the reading as
possible ahead of time. However, because it is difficult to judge exactly how
long our discussion will continue on each topic, the times in the outline are
only rough estimates. I will keep you posted regularly regarding where we are
and where we will be going in the next several classes.

PART I -- Weeks 1 and 2  
INTRODUCTION: WHAT ARE THE PROBLEMS?

**

What is "education" and what are the economic roles of education? Is the U.S.
educational system in "crisis"? How well or badly are schools preforming? Are
schools teaching people to be "productive?" Insofar as schools are teaching
people to be "productive," what exactly is it about schooling that makes
people more productive? Are schools contributing to equality? What are schools
doing and what should they be doing? What is the "education production
function"?

PART II -- Weeks 3 - 7  
EDUCATION AND THE ECONOMY: QUESTIONS OF HISTORY AND THEORY

**

How has the educational system developed in the United States? What has been
the role of schooling in U.S. history? Why have schools developed the way they
have? What is the connection between the type of work people do and the type
of education they receive? What are the economic functions of schooling? What
are the schools "producing"? What are their "inputs" and "outputs"? How is
their technology chosen? What is the educational production function? How does
our explanation of the economic functions of schooling depend on our
particular analysis of how the economy operates? How have different groups --
e.g., different racial groups -- fared differently in the history of U.S.
schooling? How do different theories regarding the role of education answer
these questions?

EDUCATION AND INEQUALITY

**

To what extent are the problems of our school system in the United States
problems of economic inequality? Why are there inequalities in the school
system? Does the school system create equal opportunities or does it
regenerate inequalities? What is the role of tracking? How do different
curricula and different "hidden curricula" reduce or generate social and
economic inequalities?

SCHOOL REFORMS AND CONTROVERSIES**

Is there a need for "reform" of the public school system? What is the nature
of the "the problem" in the schools? How does the nature of the problem affect
reform choices? To what extent is the nature of teaching a problem, and,
insofar as it is, how can this problem be overcome? What opportunities are
their for "choice" plans? What are the implications of the different choice
plans? What are characteristics of reform programs currently being implemented
-- e.g., in Massachusetts? How should we appraise these reform programs? (As
background for this part, please review the readings from Part I and read E.

al, MAKING SCHOOLS WORK: IMPROVING PERFORMANCE AND CONTROLLING COSTS, 1994.)

C. Other Controversies

**

Insofar as time permits, we may take up other controversies relevant to the
economics of education, such as: what role for charter schools? does money
matter? what is the role of teachers' unions? tracking versus de-tracking?
Resources for the discussion of these topics may include additional readings,
student reports, or guest speakers. In all cases, there are substantial
possibilities for connecting the discussion to current issues of educational
reform in Massachusetts.

CLASS PARTICIPATION

**

Because I want this course to draw on your own educational experiences as well
as upon your own direct insights into the course material, I want you to take
part actively in class discussions. Accordingly, I will take your class
participation into account when determining your final grade. However, **class
participation can only affect your grade positively**. If, for example, you
earn a  "B" on the basis of written work and attendance but have demonstrated
through class discussion an active involvement with and understanding of the
course material, your final grade could be an "A". On the other hand, if, for
example, you earn an "A" on the basis of your papers and you have attended
regularly, you will receive an "A" even if you have said nothing in class.
Likewise, don't worry about saying things in class that might be "wrong." Most
often, they will not be wrong. In any case, they will not hurt your grade.
While I hope to rely largely on voluntary participation, **I may at times call
upon students to comment whether or not they volunteer** (but, remember, you
cannot hurt your grade by your responses).

**

ATTENDANCE

**

**Attendance in this class is required.** This is one of the ways I try to
assure that you keep abreast of the readings and class discussions. Also, we
cannot have effective class discussions if people do not attend. **Attendance
means attendance for the entire class period.** Students who arrive very late
or leave very early will be considered as absent.

You will be allowed 2 unexcused absences without those absences affecting your
grade. **For each additional unexcused absence, you will lose 3 percentage
points on your grade.** **In addition, any person with a total of more than 6
unexcused absences will fail the course.** Excused absences are rare, and to
grant an excused absence I would generally require some external verification
of your reason for being absent; for example, if you are too sick to attend,
you should obtain a note from a doctor.

Also, since attendance is a required part of the course, any person who misses
an excessive number of classes cannot complete this course even if there is a
good reason for all or some of those absences \-- e.g., prolonged illness.
**Any person who misses more than 8 classes, _regardless of the reason and
regardless of whether they are excused or unexcused absence_ , cannot get
credit for the course.**

**

THE SHORT PAPER

**

For the short paper due on Thursday, March 1, I will give you a set of topics
to choose from. You will be able to write your paper on the basis of class
discussions and lectures, the readings, and your own experience. You may,
however, consult additional sources if you find that useful. The paper must be
at least 1200 words long (though high quality papers will probably be longer),
and it must be typed, double-space.

**

TERM PAPER

**

Your term paper will be due on Friday, May 18. It may be turned in either at
my office or at the office of the Department of Economics. The paper must be
at least 3,000 words in length, and must draw on several sources beyond the
course readings; the paper must be typed, double-space. It will count 45% of
your grade. I urge you to get started on your term paper as soon as possible;
doing so will make your life easier. _Your paper topic must have my approval_.
To obtain my approval, you must turn in a proposal including a page (several
paragraphs) explaining what you want to do, an outline, and a preliminary
bibliography. These proposals are due on Tuesday, April 10. I will distribute
a list of suggested topics, and I will give approval to a wide range of other
topics. My principal goal is to get you to use the knowledge and information
you will have gained in the course to examine the economic issues connected to
some aspect of school reform.

**

LATE PAPERS AND PAPER PROPOSALS

**

**Short Paper.** Due on Thursday, March 1. For each day the short paper is
late it will be marked down one-third of a grade \-- e.g., from a  "B" to a
"B-" \-- and for a weekend it will be marked down a whole grade. Thus a "B"
paper that does not reach me until Monday, March 5, will receive a "C-".
_Short papers will not be accepted after Friday, March 9._

**Term Paper.** Dure on Friday, May 18. For each day the term paper is late,
it will be marked down one-third of a grade \-- e.g., from a  "B" to a "B-".
Thus a "B" paper that does not reach me until Monday, May 21, will receive a
"C". Please note that the due date for the term paper is after classes have
ended. If you turn you paper in on the due date it can be delivered to my
office or my mail box in the Department of Economics office. If, however, you
turn your paper in late, you will need to make special arrangements to get it
to me. (You may not send the paper to me via e-mail.) _No term papers will be
accepted after Monday, May 28._ Also, a person who turns in a term paper late
may receive an  "Incomplete" for the course, even if the paper comes in before
May 28.

**Term Paper Proposal.** Due on Tuesday, April 10. For each day the term paper
proposal is late, it will be marked down one-third of a grade -- e.g., from a
"A-" to a "B+". Once a proposal is so late that it receives an "F", then for
each further day it is late one-sixth of a grade will be taken off the term
paper itself. Thus, for example, if a term paper proposal would receive a "C"
if turned in on time but it actually turned in a week late, then the proposal
itself will receive an "F" and the term paper itself will be marked down one-
third of a grade.

Any of the above may be modified for good reason. A "good reason" can almost
always be externally verified (e.g., by a copy of a hospital bill).

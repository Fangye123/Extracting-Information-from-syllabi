This course deals with methods of third party intervention with an emphasis on
mediation and facilitation.  The course takes an academic approach to the
study of mediation but includes practical applications and experiences.  The
course initially addresses mediation theory.  Following  that, the course will
focus on mediation in specialized settings.  To the extent possible,
practitioners in some of these settings will meet with the class (guest
speakers).  This course includes a number of  "role plays," offering you the
opportunity to serve at least once as a mediator, once as an
observer/evaluator, and twice as a disputant.

**Course "Rules of the Road"**

**1.   Attendance. ** This course emphasizes discussion; it needs your active
participation!  Excessive absence results in the loss of "second chance"
privileges (more than 10% of the class).  Please plan on attending class; the
disputes need you!

**2.   Readings. ** Reading exercises our brain and cuts down on MTV viewing
time, so it must be good!  Everyone will read:  
** Moore, C. W. (1996).  The Mediation Process, 2nd ed.   San Francisco:
Jossey-Bass.  
** A set of articles in a Valley Library reserve reading packet (to be
determined).  
COMM 544 students will read:  
** Baruch Bush, R. A., & Folger, J. P. (1994).  The Promise of Mediation.  San
Francisco: Jossey-Bass.

**3.   Assignments. ** COMM 444 students will complete one exam, a final
project (mediation or facilitation case, arbitration decision evaluation,
mediation training design/assessment, etc.), and write two or three papers.
COMM 544 students will take the exam, write three papers, and complete a final
project.  The two required papers  are a mediator evaluation-self paper and a
mediator evaluation-observer paper.  The other paper, optional for COMM 444
and required for COMM 544, includes options such as a mediation
theory/research critique (article, research report, book), interview of a
professional or community mediator, or evaluation of a mediation program.
Please type or "word process" your papers.  Although I evaluate your work
based on substance, pay attention to style: proofread and spell-check your
paper, and number your pages.

**4.   "Second Chance" opportunities and late papers. ** If you maintain
excellent attendance (defined as no more than 170 minutes or one class-
equivalence of absence), you may re-write or re-do papers, the exam, and
project, even into the next term.  Written work should be turned in on time.
I accept late papers, but for each  
week a paper is late, it will lost 10% of its "weight" (one day equals one
full week).   If you miss class when you are assigned to mediate or observe,
you will have to evaluate the mediator from the disputant role at 75% of the
paper's original value.  The exam must be completed when it is scheduled.
Late work is evaluated whenever I can get to it and cannot be "re-done."  Late
papers/exams cannot be re-written or re-taken.  I tend to apply more rigorous
grading standards to very late papers.

**5\. Grades.  ** Requirements differ for "B" and "A" grade goals.  To earn a
specific grade you must not simply "do" the work; you must write work of a
quality appropriate for that grade.

Grade Goal        Med. Critique    Med-S Paper   Med-O Paper    Exam
Project                 Commit 444: A  | 10 | 15 | 15 | 25 | 30 | 05  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
444: B,C,D | xx | 15 | 15 | 35 | 30 | 05  
544 (Grad) | 10 | 15 | 15 | 25 | 30 | 05  
  
The commitment grade denotes my assessment of your commitment to and
involvement in the course.  Please note that I use the +/- grading system.
Your course grade is computed by multiplying the value of the grade received
for each assignment (i.e., 12 for an A+, 10 for an A-, 8 for a B, 2 for a D,
etc.) by that assignment's weight and summing the results for all assignments.
For example, the weighted grades for a student who received all B's would sum
to a total of 8, or B.

**6.   Grade Standards.**  Evaluation of performance and achievement involves
judgments of quality.  Please note that I view quality of work as
significantly different from (and more important than) quantity of effort.  
The A range is for excellent to outstanding performance and superior
achievement.  
The B range denotes good to very good performance and substantial achievement.  
The C range indicates standard, acceptable, average performance and
achievement.  
The D range is for substandard performance and marginal achievement.  
An F is given for unsatisfactory performance and achievement.  
An I is given only for documented emergencies or other extraordinary
circumstances.  An Incomplete is not a "dead" or finals week option as a
stress management tool.

**7.   Walker's schedule. ** Office hours are Mondays and Wednesdays
1400-1600, Tuesdays from 900-1100,  and I welcome  appointments.  Please note
that I am a department chair; have natural resource management training and
facilitation projects currently underway in Minnesota and Texas; teach another
class ("environmental conflict resolution") this term; am speaking at a number
of conferences (e.g., Colorado and Arizona), and am trying to complete a
number of essays and a book.   In other words, like you, I have a busy
schedule.  I'll do my best to be accessible.  By the way, I am much more
responsive to email than the telephone.

**8.   Weekly Seminar. ** For COMM 544 students (COMM 444 students are
welcome, too) will meet in a weekly discussion group, the time to be arranged.
Attendance will be optional.  These meetings will focus primarily on the
graduate student reading material, e.g., the Baruch Bush & Folger book.

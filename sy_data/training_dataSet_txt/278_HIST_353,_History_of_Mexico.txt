REQUIREMENTS Assignments
Assignments
for this class will include
    reading, writing, and special projects. Readings maybe
assigned not only from the text,
    but also from photocopied materials, library books, and
Internet sources. Students are
    responsible for all work assigned in this class, whether or
not they are present.
    Assignments must be completed on time. Late work will be
penalized unless you have a good
    excuse, and no assignments will be accepted more than one
week late. All students are
    expected to participate regularly in class discussions.
  


Attendance and
Punctuality 
Students are responsible for material covered
and assignments regardless of
    whether or not the student has an excuse. Students are not
permitted to leave class before
    the instructor dismisses them, unless they have received
prior permission from the
    instructor. The WN policy is not in effect in this class, as this is a 300 level class. The last day to withdraw is October
      26.   


Special Note on Academic
Honesty 
Students should be aware that a
university is a community of scholars
    committed to the discovery and dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without freedom to
    investigate all materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting
findings, and proper
    acknowledgment of credit, such a community can not survive.
Students are expected to adhere
    to the highest traditions of scholarship. Infractions of these
traditions, such as
    plagiarism (cheating), are not tolerated. Misrepresenting
someone else's words or ideas as one's own constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism
occurs, the instructor has the
    right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks appropriate. One guideline holds that
    the first offence results in failure of the assignment, the
second offence in failure of
    the course.  
  


Class Participation

Class
Participation: Preparation: since
    students are expected to participate in class discussion, it
is important to complete all
    the assigned readings before coming to class. Students are
expected to understand the
    material, or at least have identified what they do not yet
understand in order to ask
    questions in class. All students are expected to come to
class prepared to discuss the
    assigned material.Students are expected to observe normal
courtesy in class. They are
    expected to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to refrain from
    personal conversation, and to avoid any other behavior that
disturbs others. A student who
    does not observe these courtesies maybe asked to leave the
room.

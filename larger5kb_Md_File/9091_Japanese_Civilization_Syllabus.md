**A NOTE ON PRONOUNCING JAPANESE:**

**Vowels are pronounced approximately as in Italian: just remember " _pasta_ ,
_prego_ , and _tutti frutti._ " Long marks (called "macrons"*) over the vowels
"o" and "u" indicate not a change in sound but rather a prolongation in time,
roughly twice as long as normal; it is as though the vowel were repeated (and
in fact, in the Japanese writing system, the "long" vowels are written as two
syllables, and some systems of romanization reflect this by using "oo" for _o_
and "uu" for _u_ ). The distinction between short and long vowels is a basic
part of the Japanese language, and can often distinguish the meaning of two
words: for example, _k osho_ means "negotiations," while _kosh o_ means
"broken"; _ogawa_ is a "small river," _o gawa_ is a "large river"; _kuki_
means "stem" but _k uki_ is "air."**

**Note that by convention, macrons are usually omitted from very common proper
nouns like Tokyo, Kyushu, and Shinto (which should properly be T okyo, Kyushu,
and Shinto), and from common nouns that have become anglicized and do not
appear in italics, such as "daimyo" and "shogun."**

*** Because vowels with long marks are not part of the ASCII character set,
they are often difficult to transmit digitally across platforms; the emerging
convention to deal with this problem is to use the circumflex as a substitute:
hence, you may increasingly see " o" and "u" [as on this Web page] instead of
proper macrons.  With the current generation of Web browsers in particular,
macrons are not yet possible, so the circumflex is the best approximation.
(The code, if you are interested, is "&xcirc;" where "x" is the vowel over
which you wish to place a circumflex.)**

**Course Description**

Content

This course will trace the historical roots of the Anglo-American legal system
and its philosophical foundations. Areas covered include the relation between
church and state, criminal law and punishment, property law, and the
foundations of government authority.

Skills

This course is designed not only to teach you the ideas of others but also to
help you develop and present your own ideas. Class discussions will help you
to articulate your thoughts on issues presented in the reading and to
anticipate objections. The writing assignments are designed to help you learn
to formulate your arguments clearly and concisely. Making the effort to state
your meaning precisely in writing will help you in thinking through your
arguments.

General Education Credit

Area II, Traditions that Shape the Western World, in the General Education

  * There will be three short paper assignments. You may revise either or both of the **first two** paper assignments in response to comments; your paper will then be regraded and the new grade will replace the original grade.
  * There will be a midterm and a final exam. Study sheets will be provided for each test.
  * Papers **must** be submitted on the dates specified on the syllabus. Papers (including revised papers) submitted outside class, or at a later date, will not be graded. It is your responsibility to make sure that your computer does not eat your paper.
  * Tests must be taken on the scheduled dates. **No** make-up tests will be given. In case of documented illness, the student will be entirely excused from the test and the final grade will be computed from the remaining assignments.

The Course: This course covers a period in the history of the United States
during which dramatic transformations took place in the country's economy,
social structure, cultural and intellectual life, political system, and
relationship to the rest of the world. We will be exploring all of these
through reading and discussing primary and secondary works. We will focus on
the changing class structure of the United States, the shifting role of the
government in country's economy and social relations, the transformation of
the relations among the races and between the sexes, the burgeoning levels of
immigration, changing ideas about governance, the evolution of the "modern"
presidency, and the creation of "modern" America.

Readings: The following required books are available at the bookstore and are
on reserve at Schaffer Library:

Nell Irvin Painter, _Standing at Armageddon_ Jacob Riis, _How the Other Half
Lives_  
Robert McMath, _American Populism: A Social History_ W. E. B. DuBois, _Souls
of Black Folk_  
Kathy Peiss, _Cheap Amusements_  
Jane Addams, _Twenty Years at Hull House_ Charlotte Perkins Gilman, _Herland_  
William Tuttle, _Race Riot_

Other readings will be handed out in class and placed on reserve at the
library.

Assignments and Grades: There are four components to the course. You must
complete all of the requirements in order to pass this course.

  1. Class participation and assignments (20% of your grade): You are expected to attend class and to complete the assigned reading for each week on time. There will also be brief homework assignments and in-class exercises, both graded and ungraded. While discussion will be incorporated into each classroom session, Friday sessions will be devoted to discussion of each week's reading. Complete the reading from the Painter book by the beginning of the week and the additional reading as soon as possible, but in no case later than Friday. In preparation for the Friday class, each student is encouraged to contribute at least one posting to an open-ended on-line discussion of the reading, as well as to participate in the classroom (see separate handout on on-line participation.) Attendance will be taken; unexcused absences will adversely affect both your grade and your learning in this course. 
  2. Essay -- due September 27 (15% of your grade): As part of our study of the Spanish-American and Philippine Wars, you will prepare a 4-6 page critical essay based on sources available on-line at http://web.syr.edu/~fjzwick/ Late papers will be penalized. (See separate handout on imperialism paper.) 
  3. Debates (week of October 21) (30% of your grade): At the end of the first week of class, you will be assigned to a team that will take the affirmative or the negative on a political issue that was current during the Progressive Era. Teams will research the issue and draw up arguments to be presented in an in-class debate. (See separate handout on debates.) 
  4. The final exam (35% of your grade).

Note: this is my syllabus for the first course I have taught on this period.
There are 30 students in the course. Union College, where I teach, has a
trimester system, with 10 week terms in which we are supposed to fit a course
that would fill a 14 week semester elsewhere. I would welcome any comments,
suggestions or questions at my e-mail address posted below.

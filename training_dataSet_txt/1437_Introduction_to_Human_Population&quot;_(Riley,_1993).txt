INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN POPULATION
Sociology 222b, Spring 1993 
Department of Sociology and Anthropology 
Bowdoin College
Meeting times: MWF 11:00-12:00 
Location: Cleaveland 123
Instructor: Nancy Riley 
Office: 2nd Floor, Ashby House Ext: 3636 
Office hours: MW: 3-4:15 PM ; T: 1:30-3:00 and by appointment

This course will introduce students to the study of human
populations from a sociological perspective. The course will deal
only very superficially with demographic methods and I assume no
previous training in statistics. Although we will touch on the
consequences of population change, especially as we discuss
population policies, the course will focus on the processes of
population change -- fertility, mortality and migration -- and on
the reasons for demographic change. We will read a number of
classic and more recent readings from the population field, as
well as selected critiques of population research and policies.

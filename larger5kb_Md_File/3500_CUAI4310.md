**Catalog Description:** Prerequisites: Admission to teacher education, CUAI
4200, CUAI 4210, CUAI 4220, and CUAI 4230. This course addresses methodology
and theories for teaching and learning elementary mathematics (K-8) with
attention paid to problem solving, diversity, current technologies, assessment
(including diagnosis and remediation), current issues in mathematics
education, reflective teaching and learning, and the application of
mathematics to everyday life.

**Additional Course Information:** This course is designed to be taken
concurrently with CUAI 4300, SCED 4320 and CUAI 4330 (with same section
numbers). Thirty hours of field experience is included in this block.

**Relation of Course to College Program and Philosophy:** This course is
designed to provide pedagogical knowledge that builds on students' content
knowledge in the area of mathematics. It provides experiences that focus on
reflective teaching, critical thinking, diversity, and collaborative learning
and enables prospective teachers to call upon a variety of tools to best
engage their students in the learning of mathematics.

**The following INTASC Standards are addressed in this course** :
#s1,2,3,4,5,7,8, and 9

**Course Objectives:**  
To learn and practice a variety of strategies for the planning and teaching of
mathematical concepts, appropriate to different learning styles to develop
appropriate materials and to make discriminating use of commercially produced
materials for the teaching and learning of mathematics to develop an awareness
of the current issues in mathematics education, including issues of equity and
diversity and the implications and applications of the NCTM Standards to learn
how to apply technology in the elementary mathematics classroom for teaching
and learning to gain an awareness of the various ways in which mathematics can
be assessed in the classroom setting to relate knowledge of contributions of
various cultures gained from the social studies education experience to the
field of mathematics to integrate mathematics with other content areas such as
science, the fine arts, language arts , and social studies to investigate
resources available, including professional journals, electronic and
technological resources, and professionals in the field to increase knowledge
of mathematical content, and to increase awareness of the real-world
applications of mathematics in a variety of social contexts

**Course Topics:** See attached schedule at the end of this syllabus.

**Requirements:**  
\- ATTENDANCE: Attendance is extremely important, and will be considered in
your final grade. You cannot participate if you are not present. Classwork is
difficult to make up through class notes; much of  
what we do in class will be hands-on, activity-based work. However, attendance
by itself does not insure a high grade; it is a necessary but not sufficient
condition. The instructor will not be responsible for re-teaching class
content if you do miss class. If you must be absent, make sure that you have
made arrangements with a classmate to take notes and pick up any handouts.

\- PARTICIPATION: Everyone is expected to be actively involved during class -
working, questioning, and problem solving. You are expected to contribute to
class discussions with thoughtful, reflective remarks.

-EXAMS: There will be two exams (mid-term and fractions). The mid-term exam will be take-home, and the fractions exam will be hands-on. The written exam must be returned by the date and time indicated on the exam. If you turn your exam in early, make sure that you hand it to me; department secretaries, graduate assistants, student workers, etc. are NOT responsible for turning in your work. Exams which are late will lose 10% of the total allotted points for each day they are late (that includes   
weekends). All exams must be legible; any that are not will be returned to the
student for rewriting. The fractions exam will require that students sign up
for a 15-minute time slot during the week of November 22 - November 29, during
which they will exhibit their ability to teach basic operations with
fractions.

-MANIPULATIVE-BASED MATH LESSON PLAN: See the description of this assignment on the web page. The lesson must use manipulatives to introduce a new mathematical concept; the lesson must not be of the drill and practice variety. See sample lesson plan for an example. Also check out the evaluation criteria. 

-NUMERATION PICTURE FIELD ASSIGNMENT: See the description of this assignment and the evaluation criteria on the web page. 

-CUISENAIRE ROD ASSIGNMENTS: You are required to complete two assignments dealing with the use of Cuisenaire Rods in the classroom: A Rod Staircase Poster, and a Rod Rug Book (rugs for red, light green, purple, yellow, dark green, black, brown, blue, orange and rOrange). 

These will be discussed in class when we begin using the materials
(staircase), and when we begin discussing the teaching of fractions (rug
book).

-MATH SOFTWARE EVALUATION and LESSON PLAN: You will be required to become familiar with at least one piece of mathematics software. This may be software demonstrated during class, borrowed from your instructor or another source, or it may be software used during your field placement. You are to 1) create a lesson plan using this software, 2) field test the lesson (and the software) with a small group of children in your field placement, and then 3) evaluate the software and 4) reflect upon the lesson. You will submit the lesson plan, the reflection, and the software evaluation to your math methods instructor. 

-INTERNET RESOURCES LIST: You are required to identify a minimum of 30 Internet resources that are appropriate for students, either as a source of mathematical problems, or as a resource for understanding or exploring mathematics. Ten resources will be appropriate for grades K-2, 10 for grades 3-5, and 10 for grades 6-8. The information will be presented in table format, with the following information:

Standard(s)

-MATHLINE VIDEOCLIP EVALUATIONS: View 2 Mathline videos and critique. \- 10 points each for 20 points total. 

-FINAL PROJECT: Students will work in groups of four to create a technology-based integrated science and mathematics Web Quest. Your instructor will discuss the requirements for this class on the morning of September 13. Initial planning time will be provided during class, but students will be expected to complete the majority of this work outside of class. Projects will be shared on the final day of class, December 6, beginning at 8:15 a.m. in room 207. This project is worth points in both math and science methods. 

GRADING: will be based upon the following percentages of total points:  
A 95% or greater     C+   80%  
A- 92%                   C     77%  
B+ 89%                   C-   75%  
B 86%                     D+  72%  
B- 83%                    D    70%

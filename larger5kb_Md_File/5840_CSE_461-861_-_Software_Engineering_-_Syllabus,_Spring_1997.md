#  Course Syllabus

### _Course Prerequisites:_

CSE 310 or any basic data structures course

### _Course Texts:_

  * _The Mythical Man-Month,_ 20th Anniversary Edition, by Fredrick Brooks, Addison-Wesley 1995. 
  * _Classical and Object-Oriented Software Engineering,_ Third Edition, by Stephen Schach, , Irwin 1996.

### _Course Overview:_

The course will familiarize students with concepts in the field of software
engineering. A broad view of the different ways in which software engineering
is approached will be presented, with some focus on the issues of requirements
engineering, interactive systems and user interface design. Students will
become familiar with the issues involved in large-scale software development,
the software life-cycle and its stages, CASE tools, object-oriented design and
analysis, interactive systems design, and software maintenance, among others.
A team design project will be assigned in which students will put the
techniques to practice by developing a medium-scale software application for
clients outside the class.

### _Grading:_

Students will be graded on the items listed below. Projects will be done in
teams of 3-5 people. Quizzes will be closed-book, but a sheet of notes will be
allowed. Essay assignments will be explained in detail through a Web page. All
project reports will be created in HTML (essays and quizzes will be
hardcopies).

Graded Item |  Undergrad  |  Grad  
---|---|---  
2 Quizzes | 20% | 12%  
Essay | 10% | 8%  
Grad Essay |  | 10%  
Project: | 70% | 70%  
Requirements, Project Plan | 10% | 10%  
Design | 10% | 10%  
Mid-term [assessment of group members](461-assessment.html) | 10% | 10%  
First prototype | 10% | 10%  
Second prototype | 10% | 10%  
[Assessment of group members](461-assessment.html) | 10% | 10% | Final Report
| 10% | 10%  
  
### _Final Grades:_

Letter grades will be assigned at the end of the course. Final grades will be
based on a competitive curve. At least the top 25% students will receive an
'A'. Graduate and undergraduate students are graded separately. Students will
be informed of their standing at intervals throughout the course. Final grades
are _not_ negotiable. Unless there are mathematical errors, I will be
unavailable to discuss final grades (see the _Newsweek_ article posted on my
door for a general view of my attitude on students bartering for grades).
Borderline cases will be considered with extreme care, and fair grades will be
rendered.

### _Attendance Policy:_

Students are expected to attend all lectures. Absences will not relieve you of
meeting course requirements. See the _TA_ to pick up any material handed out
in class. Make-up tests will only be allowed for those having a notice of
illness from the Student Health Center or a family physician. Late assignments
and reports will be downgraded one letter grade for each 24-hour period after
the due date (all due dates are at the _beginning_ of class period).

### _Lecture Transparencies:_

Hardcopies of the slides used in lecture will be handed out before the
lectures. If you miss class, hardcopies will be available from the TA.

### _Group Projects:_

The class will be divided into groups of 3-5 people that will develop
applications for external clients. Some of the clients will be from industry,
such as PEED and Union Pacific, and others will be from the university,
including some projects from my research group. Students will be responsible
for forming groups. Students will give formal presentations in the form of a
proposal, status reports, and final report. Grading criteria and project ideas
will be posted in a project Web page.

On occasion, students take advantage of group work, letting other members
perform the bulk of the work while they reap the benefits of a good grade and
can spend more time on other classes. This happens only occasionally, but it
will not be tolerated in the course. Two policies will help prevent this:

  1. Twice during the semester, group members will be asked to fill out a detailed survey on other group members. The aggregate score (throwing out scores deviating more than 25% of the average) will become part of the student's grading score. The survey will be posted on the Web (with password access) so students can see early what criteria they are being graded on. Merely attending meetings won't be enough. Group members must be prepared for meetings, make good suggestions, perform their share of the work, and work well with other members. 
  2. Students experiencing problems with a student should let me know there's a problem. Do this _**early in the semester.**_ My experience is that group members wait until it's too late to take action. My objective is to ensure that each group member has the opportunity to succeed. I will handle the situation and ensure there is no animosity while resolving the problem. Usually, a brief discussion will clear the matter up entirely.

** Course summary:  **

The course is designed as a year-long sequence to satisfy the College Science
component of the Core. My goal is to use Astronomy as a vehicle for
illustrating the modes of thought and breadth of perspective the enterprise we
call "science" provides. The first semester is confined, rather parochially I
must confess, to our solar system. Beginning with the most fundamental aspect
of science -- observation of the natural world -- we will see how our model
for the solar system and our place in it developed. The physics of light and
gravity will be explored. We then study the planets -- not by memorizing the
number of moons each has, but by looking at their common features and their
differences in terms of their internal dynamics, their surfaces, and their
atmospheres. The issue of global warming (on Earth and on other "globes") is
an example of the thematic approach used here. A discussion of the recent
discovery of planetary systems around other stars takes us another step closer
to a quantitative discussion of life elsewhere in the Universe. Study of
meteors and comets allows us to construct a detailed history of the solar
system's formation.

The second semester of the course focusses on how stars are born, shine, and
die, the creation of the elements, the formation of large collections of stars
we call galaxies, and the origin of the Universe itself.

** Prerequisites and Requirements:  **

**Prerequisite:** None, but high school algebra and latent curiousity are
assumed.

**Requirements:** This course satisfies the College Science Requirement and
the General Studies Science Requirement. It satisfies the Barnard Quantitative
Reasoning requirement IF you choose the single-author problem set option (see
below). In addition, it satisfies the Barnard Science Requirement IF you are
also signed up for the Laboratory course
[C1903](http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~jake/lablist.html), a SEPARATE one-
point course which meets one night a week. All other students are welcme to
sign up for this lab course also if they are interested. Sections will be
arranged during the second week of the semester; options include 6-9 or 7-10
on each night, Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday, and 6-9 on Wednesday. This
course CANNOT, however, be used to satisfy both Barnard requirements
simultaneously -- you must choose one or the other.

*The lowest score (which can be the one you blew off) will be dropped. 

**You may work together on the problem sets in groups of less than or equal to
three. Each group must provide only one set of solutions which includes the
names of those who contributed; all group members will receive the full credit
awarded for the work accomplished.

"The Cosmic Perspective" (Second edition) by Bennett et al.. Note that the
first edition may be substituted with only a small loss of the most recent
information and possible confusion on page numbers.

A list of aesthetically pleasing, intellectually challenging, and even helpful
Astronomy links may be found
[HERE](http://www.astro.columbia.edu/~kay/news.html), including the Astronomy
Picture of the Day and Hubble's greatest hits, a solar system simulator, a
comprehensive list of world-wide astronomy websites, and news updates from
NASA, science museums, and astronomy magazines.

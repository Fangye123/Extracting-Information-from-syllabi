**Course Description:  
** **  
** This course will survey the history of work and the worker in the United
States, with an emphasis on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. We will
consider issues such as shifting styles of work, the changing nature of
working class life and community, the evolution of organized labor movements,
and the relationship of workers and unions to the state. Issues of change in
the nature of work and working people will, of course, include race and
gender. In general, the course will connect labor history to the broader
patterns of American political, social, and economic history.  
  
**Course Objectives:  
** **  
** This course has several objectives appropriate to an upper division
introduction to the history of American labor:  

  1. To examine the ideas and themes which have shaped American labor. In specific, the student should gain an understanding of and critically reflect on developments such as those listed in the course description: the nature of work and the workplace, working class life and community, organized labor, workers and the state, and the relationship of class, race, and gender. The major topics addressed by the course are listed in the class schedule.  

  2. To acquire factual knowledge. This does not imply the memorization of facts but rather an introduction to what historians call "historical evidence"--people ( _who?_ ), places ( _where?_ ), events, ideas, trends ( _what?_ ). This evidence is the basis for understanding the history of work and working people in the United States. We will spend time with primary sources as well as secondary ones. We will also evaluate the assumptions, arguments, and claims advanced by the writers whom we study.  

  3. To learn basic concepts (theories, if you prefer) useful in understanding _how_ and _why_ the nature of American labor has evolved has changed over time.  

  4. To apply these concepts in order to make sense of the massive amount of available evidence. That is, the course should provide an opportunity for interpreting _what_ happened, _why_ it happened (and _why then?_ , as opposed to some other era). This means that we will become familiar with some of the major interpretive frameworks that historians have applied to the history of American labor.  

  5. To assess the significance of this material (the _so what?_ question) by asking why something is worth knowing. This process of explanation and interpretation is central to the historian's craft. As we practice understanding people and processes, we will gain a sense of how historians work.  
6 To develop oral and written expression through large- and small-group
discussions. Attention will be paid to the ability to present orally
evaluations and/or conclusions regarding the evidence consulted in the course.
In addition, each of us will develop questions for consideration by the class
and, on occasion, lead discussion of those questions.  
  

**Course Requirements:  
**  
The requirements are: class attendance, required readings and films listed
below, two exams and a comprehensive final, one research paper or an oral
history community service project, and demonstrated engagement with the course
material. A few words about of these requirements:  
Regular  **class attendance** is both essential and required . If one is going
to miss a class, the instructor must be contacted in advance.  Unexcused
absences will cause a reduction in grade .  
**Reading assignments** are to be completed before the class meeting for which
they are assigned. In addition, there will be several small reading
assignments handed out in class. There will be both large- and small-group
discussions based on the readings. Success in this class depends on reading
the assignments. Please note that the reading load varies from week to week
and plan accordingly. In general, however, the standard college expectation of
two hours of homework per hour of class applies to this course. That is, one
should anticipate an average of six hours of homework per week.  
**Exams** will be based on the material presented in class as well as the
readings. Students may bring to the exams one 8 1/2 X 11 inch study sheet with
whatever information you wish written on it. These study sheets may be
prepared in conjunction with other students, must be in your own handwriting,
and must contain your signature. They may not be typewritten or word
processed. They may not be photocopies. They will be collected at the end of
the exam. Sheets which do not conform to these rules will not be allowed. Each
exam score replaces the previous exam score, if the former is a higher score.
For example, if a student scores 70 on the first exam and 80 on the second,
s/he will have two exam scores of 80. If s/he scores 90 on the final exam,
s/he will have a score of 80 and two scores of 90. No make-up exams will be
given. In cases of medical or other emergency, the final exam grade will be
counted in place of the missed exam as long as permission is given  prior to
the original test.  
In brief, the **research project** (approximately 8-10 pages in length) will
report on the history of a labor action in Minnesota's past. A list of
possible topics will be circulated. Your choice must be approved by the
instructor and should be made early in the semester. A bibliography
(describing a minimum of five primary and secondary sources on the subject)
and an outline must be turned in before the paper is submitted. The paper
itself will be returned with comments in order to make revisions. Consult the
class schedule for the specific due dates.  Each step in this writing process
must be completed and the first version of the paper should be resubmitted
with the final version to receive full credit. Please, no late papers.  
The **oral history project** involves interviewing, recording, and
transcribing an interview with a retired union member. A list of interviewees
drawn up by the AFL-CIO will be circulated in class. Consult the class
schedule for the specific due dates.  Each step in this process  must be
completed and the tape of the interview should be submitted with the
transcript to receive full credit. Please, no late interview transcripts.  
Then there is the matter of **engagement** with the course. Engagement has
been defined as  
a cognitive and affective process, enabled by the relationship between student
and teacher, that stimulates curiosity and leads to focused attention, the
discovery of connections and satisfaction with learning.  
In particular, we will make connections between different aspects of the
American labor history discussed in our readings and films. We will also make
connections to contemporary issues. Demonstrating engagement includes, but is
not limited to, active participation in class activities. Therefore, each
class member is expected to participate in all small- and large-group
discussions of the course material. In addition, everyone should be prepared
to lead at least one class discussion. Feedback will be provided by the
instructor and the other members of the class. The grade for engagement and
will be determined by a mixture of instructor-, peer-, and self-assessment.
To promote this dialogue, each student must meet with me at least once before
the first exam. In addition, students are encouraged to make use of electronic
communications via e-mail and our on-line newsgroup (bulletin board)
"augsburg.his". We will experiment with different forms of electronic
communication throughout the semester.  
Augsburg College has an Academic Honesty Policy which can be found in the
Augsburg Student Guide. It is your responsibility to read and understand that
policy. All students will be asked to sign the following honesty policy
statement:  
I have read and understand the policies of Augsburg College regarding academic
honesty. I understand how they apply to this course, and I pledge myself to
abide by the policies and work to create an atmosphere of academic integrity
on the campus.  
You are encouraged to ask questions about the application of the policy in
this course.  
Students working with the CLASS Office should contact me about any necessary
accommodations.  
  
**Grading:  
**  
Grading will follow College policy. Grades will be assigned according to the
following point scale:  
  
Exam #1 - 100 points  
Exam #2 - 100 points  
Final - 100 points  
Participation/Engagement - 100 points  
Paper/Oral History Project - 100 points  
  
500 total possible points  
275 = 0.5  
300 = 1.0  
325 = 1.5  
350 = 2.0  
375 = 2.5  
400 = 3.0  
425 = 3.5  
450 = 4.0  
  
This grading scale is based on the Augsburg College Catalogue's definition of
grades as applied to this course.  
  
2.0 Meets basic standards for the course. This involves meeting the objectives
described above. Basic standards include regular class attendance,
demonstrated engagement, knowledge of the material covered in the course, the
appropriate evaluation of evidence, and the ability to make connections.  
  
3.0 Achieves above basic course standards.  
This means that all course objectives have been met and that command of the
material and the ability to think historically go beyond the basics by
demonstrating an ability to organize the material independently.  
  
4.0 Achieves highest standards of excellence.  
This means mastery of all aspects of the course material. Work at this level
is based on critical thinking at high levels which synthesizes a wealth of
evidence in drawing conclusions.

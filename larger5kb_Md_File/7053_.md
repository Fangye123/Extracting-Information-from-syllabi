Office Hours: Monday evenings, before and after class, and by appointment.

Seminar Format: Each week the seminar will devote its attention to the
critical evaluation of selected writings on a major topic in U.S. political
history in the 20th Century. Students will complete the required reading and
come to class prepared to discuss the topic for the week. Each week's
discussion will be led by students who have prepared reviews of books on the
assigned topic.

  
  

Book Reviews: Each student will present the seminar with two oral and three
written reviews of books taken from the list of books in the syllabus. Student
reviews will be no longer than three type-written single-spaced pages.
Students are responsible for duplicating their reviews for distribution to the
seminar at the beginning of the class period. (Two copies for the instructor)

  
  

Reviews should contain the following: a brief biographic sketch of the author;
the author's point of view and influencing assumptions; a statement of the
scope of the work; the author's thesis statement (implied or directly stated);
an evaluation of the author's research design, sources, use of evidence, and
effectiveness of presentation; a brief summary of the substantive content of
the book; the major contribution(s) of the book; the book's place in the
literature; and, finally, your own impressions of the book.

  
  

Historiographical Review/Interpretative Essay: Each student will write a 12-15
page historiographical essay reviewing and interpreting the literature on a
relevant topic in 20th Century U.S. political history. Topics must be approved
by the instructor. Essays will describe a problem, issue, event, or subject;
they will present historians' views of the topic and analyze interpretative
issues. For topics lacking a large secondary literature, you should include
comments on principal primary sources.

Students are required to present a one-page precis and preliminary
bibliography by **February 28**. Progress reports (brief oral presentations to
the seminar) will be given on **April 21**. Papers are due in Hilty's mailbox
in the History office (913 Gladfelter Hall) no later than Noon, **May 9**.

  
  

Final grades will be based on class participation (15%), the quality of the
two oral reviews (10%), three written reviews (30%), the precis and
preliminary bibliography (10%), and historiographical essay (35%).

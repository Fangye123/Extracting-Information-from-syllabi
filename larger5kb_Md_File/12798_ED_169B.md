lecture outline  
detailed lecture notes and readings

This course introduces ways of thinking about and seeing the history and
culture of the United States as revealed in everyday built environments. The
lectures survey basic landscape elements that Americans have used from 1900 to
the present, including homes, highways, farms, factories, stores, recreation
areas, city districts, and regions. The course encourages students to read
landscapes as records of past and present social relations and economics, and
to speculate for themselves about the cultural meanings of ordinary
surroundings.

The reader and AC 15 will be available at Copy Central, 2560 Bancroft Way. The
other titles will be at Campus Textbook Exchange, 2470 Bancroft. If you cannot
afford them all, the texts are listed in order of importance.

**Requirement Set One** \--If you have NOT taken the "A" course:

1\. Taking the AC 15 Oakland field trip  
2\. Midterm exam with slide interpretation 20%  
3\. A six- to ten-page research essay 40%  
4\. Final exam 40%

If you have already taken the "A" course, you have a choice of two different
grading options, as shown below.

**Requirement Set Two** \--Options if you have already taken the "A" course:

The new essay option: Write a new research essay for 40% of your course grade.
As with other students in the class, your midterm will count 20% and the
final, 40%. [Note: new essays or book comparisons are due on the same date
that research essays are due. See the course outline.]

The book comparison option: Since you have already written a full-sized essay
for the other half of the course, you might want to develop some of your other
critical and writing faculties. If so, select a pair of contrasting books from
the book comparison guide at the back of the course reader, and then prepare a
critical and evaluative comparison of those two books, from 3 to no more than
5 pages long.* Some of the book pairs are on reserve in the ED Library. You
might consider simply buying the pair of books you report on, since most of
the suggested book pairs are available in paperback and all are classics. Your
book comparison will count for 20% of your grade; the midterm, 20%, and the
final, 60%.

**For more information:**

Previewing assignments. If you have not yet bought the reader (which has all
assignment guides at the back), the guidelines for the assignments are posted
outside Paul Groth's office, 486 Wurster Hall.

Finding Paul Groth's office. Room 486 is in the south (short) tower of
Wurster, facing the law school and College Avenue. For those new to this part
of the campus, remember that Wurster Hall has two fourth floors. The red
(north) elevator and the stairs on the north tower of the building will not
work. Use the blue (south) elevator and the south stairs to find Room 486.

OUTLINE OF LECTURE TITLES**

**To see is to think. To think is to put together random bits of private
experience in an orderly fashion. Seeing is not a unique God-given talent, but
a discipline. It can be learned.

DETAILED SYLLABUS OF LECTURES AND READINGS

Over and over again I have said that the commonplace aspects of the
contemporary landscape, the streets and houses and fields and places of work,
could teach us a great deal not only about American history and American
society but about ourselves and how we relate to the world. It is a matter of
learning how to see. (J. B. Jackson, author and inventor of this course, 1984)

Believing, with Max Weber, that humans are animals suspended in webs of
significance they themselves have spun, I take culture to be those webs, and
the analysis of it to be...an interpretive science in search of meaning.
(Clifford Geertz, anthropologist, 1973)

Although delving for cultural meaning is as much an interpretive art as it is
a science, this course takes up Geertz's theme. Together we will examine the
key physical webs of American culture: how they evolved, their past meanings,
and how they express and create webs of significance which still surround us.
Similarly, we will learn to see the effects of social and cultural forces in
our ordinary landscapes. The aim, in general, is to connect our eyes to our
brains as we consider our everyday surroundings.

NOTES**

**About late work:**

1\. _We cheerfully accept late papers_ , but work is graded and returned in
the order received.  
2\. _Papers are due at the_ beginning _of class_ \--that is, when the lecture
formally begins. Work received after the lecture begins is considered late,
and receives a reduced grade.  
3. _The grades of late papers are reduced_ , one third of a grade (from an A to A-, A- to B+, and so on) for every week after the deadline. For grading purposes, weeks start at the beginning of the Tuesday class period. We can accept no student work after the beginning of the final exam. 

**Return of final exams and final grades.**

If you would like us to MAIL you your final exam and final grade, give us a
large self-addressed envelope stamped with the appropriate amount of postage.
Your exam will follow you anywhere. For news of your grade alone, give us a
stamped postcard.

All other final exams will be placed in the hallway across from Paul Groth's
office (486 Wurster) until July 1st. After July 1st exams still languishing in
the hall will be discarded.

**About using library reserve readings.**

The required course texts (including the Oakland Tour, AC 15), and one copy of
this reader are on overnight reserve in the ED Library, 210 Wurster Hall. For
those writing book comparisons instead of a new paper, the leading pairs of
books are on one-day reserve. The library staff have asked us to include these
instructions for locating reserves in the GLADIS online catalog:

1\. _Look up course name (CO) or instructor name (IN)_. For this course, you
would type F CO ENVD 169B.

2. _Gladys should then display the titles on reserve_.

3\. _Identify the appropriate title_. Write down the library location and call
number. Items listed as "IN PROCESS" are not yet available.

4\. _To see whether or not an item is checked out, SELECT THE TITLE by typing
the line number._

5\. _Bring the call number (e.g., NA112 G71 no 5, or FC182) to the Circulation
Desk,_ and Library staff will check the book out to you for the specified time
period. Note: There is a limit of 2 reserve items per person at a time.

Type HELP COURSE (CO) or HELP INSTRUCTOR (IN) for more specific instructions.
Type HELP ABBREVIATIONS for a list of official course abbreviations.

### _Academic Life_

| **ADMINISTRATION**  
  

The Vice President for Academic Affairs provides overall leadership for the
academic agenda of the University. The Deans of the four undergraduate
colleges, the Dean of the Graduate School - Arts & Sciences and the Dean of
the Law School report to the Vice President. The Dean for Enrollment
Management, who provides supervision for Admissions, Financial Assistance, and
the Registrar also reports to the Vice President for Academic Affairs, as does
the Director of the Falvey Library, the Director of International Studies, and
the Office for Research and Sponsored Projects.

The Dean of a school or college has, under the general supervision of the Vice
President for Academic Affairs, particular charge of a school or college, its
faculty, and its student body. Department Chairs and Program Directors report
to the Dean of the appropriate college or in some cases to the Vice President
directly. The graduate aspects of departmental responsibility in Liberal Arts
and Sciences fall under the specific jurisdiction of the Dean of the Graduate
School.

Departmental Chairpersons are responsible for the for formulation and
execution of academic, administrative, and fiscal policies of the department
within the context of the broader policies set forth by the University.

**ACADEMIC POLICIES**

For your convenience, the following academic policies are reprinted here.
However, in academic matters, this handbook is considered subordinate to the
applicable University Catalog, academic handbook, or most current
communication from the college dean.  
  
**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY AND PLAGIARISM**  

As a community committed to the Augustinian ideals of truth, unity and love,
Villanova University prides itself on maintaining the highest standards of
academic integrity and does not tolerate any form of academic dishonesty or
misconduct. Dishonesty (including plagiarism) in any assignment, test or
examiniation is punishable by the grade of F and is to be reported, through
the deans, to the Vice President for Academic Affairs. A second offense will
result in the dismissal of the student from Villanova University.

In addition, each student who takes an examination is expected to sign the
following statement, which is printed on the official University examination
booklets.

I___________(your name) have not had any unsanctioned prior access to this
examination and will conduct myself in an honest manner in regard to all
aspects of this examination. Unless authorized by the course professor, I will
not discuss the contents of this examination, in general or specific terms,
until the examination is administered to all students.  
  
**CODE OF ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**  

Academic integrity is vital to any university community for many reasons.
Students receive credit for doing assignments because they are supposed to
learn from those assignments, and the vast majority do so honestly. Anyone who
hands in work that is not his or her own, or who cheats on a test, or
plagiarizes a paper, is not learning, is receiving credit dishonestly and is,
in effect, stealing from other students. As a consequence, it is crucial that
students do their own work. Students who use someone else's work or ideas
without saying so, or who otherwise perform dishonestly in a course, are
plagiarizing or cheating. In effect they are lying. Such dishonesty, moreover
threatens the integrity not only of the individual student, but also of the
university community as a whole.

Academic integrity lies at the heart of the values expressed in the
University's mission statement and inspired by the spirit of Saint Augustine.
When one comes to Villanova, one joins an academic community founded on the
search for knowledge in an atmosphere of cooperation and trust. The
intellectual health of the community depends on this trust and draws
nourishment from the integrity and mutual respect of each of its members.

The following are some rules and examples regarding academic dishonesty. Since
academic dishonesty takes place whenever anyone undermines the academic
integrity of the institution or attempts to gain an unfair advantage over
others, this list is not and cannot be exhaustive. Academic integrity is not
simply a matter of conforming to certain rules; it must be understood in terms
of broader academic purposes of a Villanova education.

1\. Cheating:

**While taking a test or examination, students shall rely on their own mastery
of the subject and not attempt to receive help in any way not explicitly
approved by the instructor; for example, members shall not try to use notes,
study aids, or another's work.**

Such cheating includes trying to give or obtain information about a test when
the instructor states that it is to be confidential. It also includes trying
to take someone else's exam, or trying to have someone else take one's own
exam.  

2\. Fabrication:

**Students shall not falsify, invent, or use in a deliberately misleading way
any information, data, or citations in any assignment.**

This includes makingup or changing data or results, or relying on someone
else's results, in an experiment or lab assignment. It also includes citing
sources that one has not actually used or consulted.  

3\. Assisting in or contributing to academic dishonesty:

**Students shall not help or attempt to help others to commit an act of
academic dishonesty.**

This includes situations in which one student copies from or uses another
student's work; in such situations, both students are likely to be penalized
equally severely. (If the assisting student is not enrolled in the particular
course, the Hearing Panel will formulate a suitable and equivalent penalty.)
Students are responsible for ensuring that their work is not used improperly
by others. This does not include team projects where students are told by
their instructor to work together.  

4\. Plagiarism:

**Students shall not rely on or use someone else's words, ideas, data, or
arguments without clearly acknowledging the source and extent of the reliance
or use.**

The most common way to acknowledge this reliance or indebtedness is to use
footnotes or other documentation. It is the students' responsibility to show
clearly when and where they are relying on others - partly because others may
wish to learn from the same sources from which the original writer learned.
Since this indebtedness may be of many kinds, some definitions and examples of
plagiarism are listed below.  

A. Using someone else's words without acknowledgmnet. If you use someone
else's words, not only must you give the source, but you must also put them
within quotation marks or use some other appropriate means of indicating that
the words are not your own. This includes spoken words and written words, and
mathematical equations, whether or not they have been formally published.  

B. Using someone else's ideas, data, or argument without acknowledgment, even
if the words are your own. If you use someone else's examples, train of
thought, or experimental results, you must acknowlege that use. Paraphrasing,
summarizing, or rearranging someone else's words, ideas, or results does not
alter your indebtedness.  

C. Acknowledging someone else in a way that will lead a reader to think your
indebtedness is less than it actually was. For example, if you take a whole
paragraph worth of ideas from a source, and include as your final sentence a
quotation from that source, you must indicate that your indebtedness includes
more than just the quotation. If you simply put a page number after the
quotation, you will lead the reader to think that only the quotation comes
from the source. Instead, make clear that you have used more than the
quotation.  

The examples above constitute plagiarism regardless of who or what the source
is. The words or ideas of a roommate or of an encyclopedia, or notes from
another class, require acknowledgment just as much as the words or ideas of a
scholarly book do. Introductions and notes to books also require
acknowledgment.

The examples above constitute plagiarism even if you simply forget to include
a reference, forget that you used a certain source, or forget that you found
certain ideas or a certain argument or certain data in a source. You are
responsible for taking careful notes on sources. Notes must clearly identify
the information you have obtained and where you acquired it, so that later you
can acknowledge your indebtedness accurately. Do not look at a source without
having something handy with which to take such notes.

You need not provide footnotes for items that are considered common knowledge.
What constitutes common knowledge, however, varies from academic field to
academic field, so you should consult with your instructor. In general, the
harder it would be for someone to find the fact you have mentioned, the more
you need to footnote it.  

5\. Multiple submission of work:

**Students shall not submit academic work for a class which has been done for
another class without the prior approval of the instructor.**  

In any assignment, an instructor is justified in expecting that a certain kind
of learning will be taking place. Handing in something done previously may
preclude this learning. Consequently, if a student hands in work done
elsewhere without receiving his or her instructor's approval, he or she will
face penalties.  

6\. Other forms of Dishonesty:  

Acting honestly in an academic setting includes more than just being honest in
one's academic assignments; students are expected to be honest in all dealings
with the University. Certain kinds of dishonesty, though often associated with
academic work, are of a different category than those listed above. These
kings of dishonesty include (but are not limited to) the following:  

A. Misrepresenting oneself or one's circumstances to an instructor (for
exmple, in requesting a makeup exam or a special due date for an assignment,
or in explaining an absence).

B. Forging parts of, or signatures on, official documents (including both
university documents, such as drop-add slips or excused absence slips, and
relevant outside documents, such as doctors' notes).

C. Taking credit for work in a team-project even when the student has made
little or no contribution to the work of the team.

D. Stealing or damaging library books.

E. Unlawfully copying computer software.

These serious offenses will be handled by the University's disciplinary
procedures.  
**CLASSROOM EXPECTATIONS**  

1\. A professor will normally provide at the beginning of each semester, an
outline of the lectures, activities, assignments, and grading system
appropriate to the course.

2\. Examinations - final examinations are given in every course at the time
and place designated. Special permission is necessary to resolve conflicts in
schedules. A student has a conflict if two of his/her examinations are
scheduled at the same time or if three of his/her examinations are scheduled
on the same day. In the event of a conflict in examination schedules, the
student must request in advance a special examination to be given by one of
the instructors in accordance with the following directions. Extraordinary
difficulties encountered in effecting such an arrangement will be resolved by
the deans of the respective colleges. Guidelines: a. group departmental
examinations take precedence, b. major or required courses should take
precedence over electives, c. regular courses should take precedence over
repeat courses.

Absence from a semester examination, except for a conflict, requires written
permission from the instructor, and the student must present it, countersigned
by the dean of the college, at the time of the make-up examination.

Credit by Examination may be gained three ways; a. advanced placement program,
b. departmental examinations, c. college level examination program.

Information about these is available through your academic college.  
  

3\. Class Attendance:

Freshman class and laboratory attendance is compulsory except as noted below:
approved athletic participation, approved field trips, certified serious
illness, death in the immediate famity, or approved placement activities. The
Student Absence Card, available from the dean's office, must be presented to
the dean no later than 4:30 pm on the day the student returns to classes.
Excused absences allow the student to make up tests and do not count toward a
failure in the course. Absence from class does not release the student from
the work.

First year students should complete the excused absence request form in their
dean's office and receive from the dean's office either an "excused" or
"rejected" absence card. If a student was at the Health Center, the Health
Center will issue the "excused" absence card.

A freshman will receive a grade of XF (failure) whenever he/she has been
absent unexcused once more than double the number of weekly meetings for the
course.

For sophomores, juniors, and seniors the individual instructor sets the
attendance regulations for the course section the instructor teaches. It is
the responsibility of the upper class student to present an explanation of
absence and supportive evidence to the faculty member, who has the
responsibility of deciding whether the absence should be excused. Questions
raised by either the upper class student or the instructor concerning
attendance should be referred to the chairpersons of the department offering
the course.

4\. Plagiarism - dishonesty in any assignment, test or examination is
punishable by the grade of F and is to be reported, through the deans, to the
Vice President for Academic Affairs. A second offense will result in the
dismissal of the student from Villanova University.  
  
**DROP AND ADD PROCEDURES**

1\. Drop/Add - students will be notified of the more restrictive Drop/Add
policy through their college dean.

2\. Authorized withdrawal from a course must occur during the first 5 weeks of
the semester. Freshmen are allowed the opportunity to withdraw (WX) from
courses up to nine (9) weeks after the commencement of classes, acknowl-
edging that the time to complete their degree may be extended and that they
have informed their parents, where appropriate. After this period of time, the
dean of the college is the final authority for granting or refusing the
exception based on the documentation presented. If a student stops attending a
course without an Authorized Withdrawal, a grade of Y will be assigned. This
computes into the quality point grade as an F.

3\. Change of major must be approved by the dean of the college having
jurisdiction over the program the student wishes to enter.

4\. Withdrawal from the University is granted by the dean of the appropriate
college.  
  
**GRADING**

1 . Grade reports are computed at the middle of each semester and at the end.
These reports are mailed to each student. Mid- term grades are not a part of
the permanent record.

2\. Definition of grades;

At the beginning of each semester, as part of the course syllabus, every
faculty member will explicity declare, in writing criteria for grading to
students in his or her courses and, during the semester, will provide as much
information as possible with respect to an individual student's progress and
the evaluation of the final grade assigned:  
  
A is the highest academic grade possible; an honor grade which is not
automatically given to a student who ranks highest in the course, but is
reserved for accomplishment that is truly distinctive and demonstrably
outstanding. It represents a superior mastery of course material and is a
grade that demands a very high degree of understanding as well as originality
or creativity as appropriate to the nature of the course. The grade indicates
that the student works independently with unusually effectiveness and often
takes the initiative in seeking new knowledge outside the formal confines of
the course  
A-  
B+  
B is a grade that denotes achievement considerably above acceptable standards.
Good mastery of course material is evident and student performance
demonstrates a high degree of originality, creativity, or both. The grade
indicates that the student works well independently and often demonstrates
initiative. Analysis, synthesis, and critical expression, oral or written, are
considerably above average.  
B-  
C+  
C indicates a satisfactory degree of attainment and is the acceptable standard
for graduation from college. It is the grade that may be expected of a student
of average abiity who gives to the work a reasonable amount of time and
effort. This grade implies familiarity with the content of the course and
acceptable mastery of course material; it implies that the student displays
some evidence of originality and/or creativity, and works independently at an
acceptable level and completes all requirements in the course  
C-  
D+  
D denotes a limited understanding of the subject matter, meeting only the
minimum requirement for passing the course. It signifies work which in quality
and/or quantity falls below the average acceptable standard for the course.
Performance is deficient in analysis, synthesis, and critical expression;
there is little evidence or originality, creativity, or both.

While composing their grade criteria, faculty will seriously consider the
official University grade definition guidelines and will incorporate them as
appropriate to the nature of the course.

3\. Pass/Fail regulations which apply to all colleges: a. Pass/Fall is shown
on the transcript but not included in the quality point average. Credits for
courses with Pass grades are included in credits earned. b. Failures need not
be repeated, c. P is equal to the grade D or better. d. Student must opt for
P/F within the time frame indicated in registration information each semester.

Each college may have additional regulations governing the pass/fail option.
This information is available from the college dean.

4\. In addition to passing all required courses, a cumulative quality point
average of at least 2.0 is necessary for graduation. The quality point average
is determined by big the number of credits for each course limes the quality
points earned, and dividing the total quality points by the total credit hours
attempted.

5\. Rank in class is determined by the cumulative quality point average. No
student will be ranked who is not carrying the equivalent of 12 credit hours.
Only credits earned within Villanova University or in formally approved inter-
institutional programs will be considered. Credits earned at other colleges
are not counted in the quality point average.

6\. Academic Probation - The Academic Standing Committee, at the end of any
given semester, may take the following action: subject to probation or
dismissal - all students with less than a 2.0, subject to dismissal - seniors
with less than a 2.0, juniors with less than a 1.95, sophomores with less than
a 1.80, freshmen with less than a 1.60.

Satisfactory progress toward the degree, as delineated above, is not to be
equated will being a student in good standing. A student in good standing is
one who has a cumulative quality point average above 2.0.

Normally a student on academic probation will be allowed only one semester to
achieve the required quality point average. While on academic probation, a
student's course load is limited to five courses (4 in the College of liberal
Arts and Sciences) and is not eligible to participate in extra or co-
curricular activides.

7\. Dean's list (full-rime students only) - To qualify, a student must have a
semester average of 3.25 in the College of Engineering, 3.5 in the College of
Nursing, 3.5 in the College of Commerce and Finance, and a 3.5 in the fall and
spring semesters of the academic year in the College of liberal Arts and
Sciences with no non-passing or missing grades on the *semester(s) report.

academic program at Villanova, taken for a grade.

9\. Transcripts - official transcripts are available by applying in person or
by writing to the Office of the Registrar. There is currently no charge for
this service. Normally, requests can be processed within two weeks of the
notification date.

10\. Each faculty member has on file in the department office a list of office
hours set aside for student advisement and consultation. Students are
encouraged to meet with faculty members at these times, or by arrangement, to
discuss their progress in courses and to develop more effective strategies for
mastering their discipline.

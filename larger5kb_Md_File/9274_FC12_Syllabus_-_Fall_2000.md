_Indian civilization is a complex weave of many traditions and cultures. In
this course we take a long trajectory through the history of the subcontinent,
studying and following some of the threads that shape this complexity from the
Indus civilization to today. We will read primary sources from the Vedas and
Upanishads,   the Buddhist and Jain movements,  the Mahabharata and the
Bhagavad Gita, the Bhakti poets and songsters, the Sikh gurus,  Muslim kings
and Sufis, and nineteenth & twentieth century thinkers, reformers, poets, and
nationalist leaders. _

Divinity Ave.). Also on reserve in Lamont and Hilles Libraries. In addition to
the required reading, a Foreign Cultures 12 Reserve Anthology will include a
carefully selected group  of supplementary readings for many of the sections
of the course.  These articles and book chapters will take you one step
further in thinking about each of the topics. Within a few weeks, we will also
provide some annotated bibliographies on the course  website that may well
serve as the starting point for your term paper.

**FILMS**

There will be a set of films shown in the semester that will be integral to
the course.  The film times will be at 4:00 and again at 7:00 on Thursdays.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

(1)   Active section participation. Five short three-page reflections on the
reading will be due in section during the weeks of Feb. 13, Feb. 27, Mar. 12,
Apr. 2, and Apr. 17. There is no mid-term exam.  These, along with your
section participation, will cumulatively constitute 1/3 of the course grade.

(2)  Term Paper. This gives you a chance to explore a topic germane to the
subject matter of this course and close to your own interests as they develop.
This paper should be about 15 pages in length.  An extensive term paper
bibliography will be posted on the web, and guidelines for the term paper will
be distributed. You should begin discussing  your interests with your section
leader early in the term, and look through materials we cover late in the
semester to discover possible topics there. Your own paper topic and
bibliography should be submitted in final form to your section leader by
Monday, May 1.  The paper is due the last day of reading period: Wednesday,
May 16, by 5:00 p.m. in Barker 307.  The term paper will constitute 1/3 of the
course grade.

(3)   Final Exam on Wednesday, May 23. The exam will constitute 1/3 of the
course grade.

**GOALS OF THE COURSE:** Anthropology 3250 is designed as a survey of the
native cultures that inhabited Mexico, Central America and South America
before and at the time of European conquest.   Although technically an
archaeology course, our knowledge of the subject is gained through
archaeology, ethnohistory, sociocultural anthropology, mythology and a variety
of other related disciplines.  Because of the multitude of complex societies
occupying the area and the limitations of an eleven week quarter, a small
number of well-documented cultures have been chosen for intensive study (see
lecture schedule below).  The course will explore the character of
precolumbian civilizations in regard to their art, political systems, economy,
technology and religions.  Due to the wealth of religiously inspired art,
emphasis will be placed on iconography and comparative religious systems.  
  
     In addition to its formal subject matter Precolumbian American is also somewhat of a palimpsest,  an old parchment on which the surface writing is only the most obvious and superficial of many layers of deeper, more ancient writings.  Woven through the structure of Anthro 3250 is also an examination of the worldviews of the original inhabitants of Mesoamerica and the Andes, with the implicit assumption that the worldview of the Moche, Maya or Incas may have some relevance to our life at the end of the 20th century.

**GRADES:** This course uses a two-tiered, contractual grading system. If you
wish to be considered for an 'A' or an 'A-', you must write a research paper
in addition to exam and participation requirements; if you wish to set your
grade ceiling at a 'B+', you can forego the paper and only need to fulfill the
exam and participation requirements. See the table below for details.

Since many of you will find that the volume of new material in this course is
quite heavy and the online delivery method is unfamiliar, consider taking the
course Credit/No Credit. If you have not taken a course with this grading
option, you can read about it in the [online
catalog](http://www.csuhayward.edu/ecat/19992000/i-120grading.html#section2)
and and do it online through [eSailor](http://esailor.csuhayward.edu/). The
last day to file for this option is TUESDAY _ **,**_ _April 16_ _.  
  
  
_**BLACKBOARD LECTURES AND EXERCISES:** The 38 online slide and voice lectures
listed above along with various interactive exercises, periodic exams, the
online gradebook, etc. are delivered via the CSUH "Blackboard" application
**.** You can log in to your Blackboard site from a button at
<http://www.csuhayward.edu/csuh_students/csuh_students.html>**.** There you
will also find a button called "MyInfo." Be sure that your correct and current
email address is in the system. Without a correct email address you will
receive none of the esential mass emails that I send to the class.

**  
EXAMS:  ** The exams will consist of approximately 50% objective questions
which test specific, factual knowledge and 50% essay questions which test your
ability to synthesize and interpret larger concepts. The objective questions
generally will be of the true-or-false and multiple-choice variety. Your
ability to synthesize information and concepts will be tested through essay
questions. You will be presented with a choice of several essay questions from
which you will choose one or two to answer.  
  
The exams sometimes will include slides/drawingsto be identified. Aside from
the images presented during the online lectures you can review imagery and
concepts on the web site ["Images of Ancient
America"](http://isis.csuhayward.edu/alss/anth/miller/3250/index.html) which
was developed originally for the Fall 1999 classroom version of this course.
Reviewing the material on this site is not necessary for a successful Anthro
3250online experience, but it certainly will be helpful.

**RESEARCH PAPER OR PROJECT:**   If you select the "'A' possibility option for
this course, you will need to write a _problem-oriented_ research paper of 10
pages or more,   dealing with a prehistoric Mesoamerican or South American
culture.

The paper should conform to university-level research paper standards.  This
implies that it should:  
1) define an analytical problem or controversy of scholarly interpretation in
the field(s) of Mesoamerican or Andean prehistory and attempt to both present
evidence relevant to the subject as well as draw some conclusions concerning
it.  
  
 2) be organized in something like -- Introduction (Background), Presentation
of evidence (Data), and Conclusions (your balancing of the evidence and
interjection of your personal opinion).  
  
 3) contain a bibliography and a standard system of text citation (I recommend
_American Anthropologist_ or _American Antiquity_ style; an example of
_American Antiquity_ style can be found in my and Richard Burger's Chavin
article in the _Precolumbian America_ reader. Basically this is an  "in-text"
citation system (e.g., Coles 1987:173-174) that does not require actual
footnotes or endnotes).

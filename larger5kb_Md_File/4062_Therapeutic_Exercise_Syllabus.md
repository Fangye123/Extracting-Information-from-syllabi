**ATTENDANCE POLICY:** Class attendance is essential for success, as well as a
thorough understanding of the material.   Excused absences may be granted if
prior notice is given, or for illness at the discretion of the instructor.
Students missing class for athletic events need to give **1 week** prior
notice and complete all assignments prior to departure.  It is the student's
responsibility to request any additional work or assistance from the
instructor upon returning from the absence.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**   The theory and practice of comprehensive
rehabilitative programs including determination of therapeutic goals and
objectives, selection of therapeutic exercises, methods of evaluating and
recording rehabilitation progress, development of criteria for return to
competition and the physiological effects of tissue trauma/wound healing and
inactivity/immobilization.  3 credits.  Prerequisites:  PHED 210, 386, PHYS
101.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

    * Demonstrate an applied knowledge of the effects of inactivity, immobilization, wound healing and trauma, and their implications in regard to rehabilitation and functional progressions of rehabilitation programs.
    * Understand the physiological process of wound healing and tissue repair and its implications on the development and progression of an appropriate rehabiliation or re- conditioning program.
    * Interpret appropriate measurement and functional testing procedures as they relate to therapeutic exercise.
    * Objectively measure strength and range of motion as a basis for developing individualized rehabilitation or re-conditioning programs
    * Describe common surgical techniques and pathology that may affect the implementation of a rehabilitation program.
    * Use assessment and evaluation techniques to determine appropriate rehabilitation plans for returning to physical activity.
    * Demonstrate proper care and functional progression for post-surgical cases, including an understanding of the rehabilitative guidelines associated with typical surgical procedures.
    * Display an applied knowledge of passive, active and resistive exercise.
    * Display an applied knowledge assessing rehabilitation goals and objectives and the role they play in the assessment of functional progressions and criteria for return.
    * Apply theory and principles asociated with special therapeutic exercise techniques, including proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation and joint mobilization techniques.
    * Apply rehabilitative concepts to fit specific joint and surgery cases.
    * Interpret physician notes, post-operative notes and physician prescriptions as they pertain to a rehabilitation plan.
    * Develop and monitor a rehabilitation program for specific athletic injuries.
    * Inspect therapeutic exercise equipment to ensure safe operating condition.

  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

__Exams__ :  
2 written and 1 Final comprehensive

    * Primarily objective in nature (true/false, multiple choice, identification, short answer)
    * Final exam may have more subjective quality (application of previous ideas in a case study format)
1 Midterm and 1Final practical

    * Primarily task oriented (perform a specific procedure)
    * Final practical may have more subjective quality (application of previous ideas in case study)

  
__Quizzes:__  
There will be 6 quizzes spread throughout the semester.   The highest 5 quiz
grades will count toward the final grade.

__Surgical Observations:__  
Students will be required to view three surgeries, and select one on which to
write a procedural report, as well as a literature review.   The details for
this assignment can be found on the course web-site.

__Physical therapy observations:__  
Students will spend 8 hours observing Licensed Physical Therapists in an
outpatient physical therapy clinic.   The purpose of the observations is to
gain an understanding of the rehabilitation process from a new perspective.
The student will write a summary of the observations.  The objectives for this
assignment can be found on the course web-site.

__Student Presentations:__  
Students will select a condition/injury requiring a rehabilitation plan.   The
purpose of the assignment is to allow the student to develop and carry out a
thorough plan for an injured athlete.  A written review and oral presentation
will be made to the class.  
    **_Rehabilitation Notebook :_**   
    Students will submit an exercise plan for their selected body segment.  The plan will consist of therapeutic   
    exercises written in an organized format.  The class will compile these in a notebook that each   
    student can keep for future reference.  Grading will be based on individual contributions. 

__In Class Assignments:__  
    _Lab Activities:_   
    Students will submit written summaries and answers to questions from in-class lab activities. 

__Rehabilitation Technique Practice:__  
Students will be required to practice techniques outside of the classroom.
Proof of this practice can be demonstrated via video tape, or signed
documentation from certified athletic trainers.

__Lab sessions:__  
Students are expected to dress appropriately for lab exercises.   Bring a pair
of shorts and a t-shirt to class each day.  


**GRADING POLICY:**  
Each scoring opportunity will be given a point value.   Final grades will be
based on total points out of 800 points for the semester.  The breakdown is as
follows:

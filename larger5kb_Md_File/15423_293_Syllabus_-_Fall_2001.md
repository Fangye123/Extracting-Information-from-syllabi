COURSE GOALS

In an ideal world, this course would enable us to know how it feels to walk in
our sisters' moccasins, huaraches, and bound feet. It would free our minds of
racist and sexist limitations, leading us to engage the Other in passionate
strategies of compassion, learning from American Indian, Chicana, and Asian
women what it is to be a 'minority' in the US of A. Want to try riding their
words into another reality?

COURSE STRUCTURE

The way to get where we want to go is by listening. To listen well is a
difficult art, but one we need facility in. Our course structure is reading
and discussion. Since the point in studying these authors is to hear voices
that have been suppressed, we can begin by listening to each other and to
ourselves, recognizing that we all have had many experiences living inside our
own skin and gendered body. One kind of listening is reading, which also
demands that we open ourselves to the voice of the Other. You will be expected
to write a piece of literary criticism. We will also engage in some project or
activity that has a strong component of non-mainstream culture, research a
topic, give a report on it, and write two short-answer essay exams.

WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS

Self-Reflective Analysis/Journal  
Literary Analysis Essay  
Two Essay Exams  
Report on Non-Mainstream Activity

PARTICIPATION, ATTENDANCE, LATE ARRIVALS

Since discussion is at the core of this course, attendance is required. I'll
give you up to three excused absences, but anything beyond that puts your
grade at risk. Six absences will lower your grade by one full letter; eight
and you will fail the course. I will warn chronically late students once.
After that I will count each late appearance as an absence. The participation
portion of your grade involves your being in class, being prepared, and
participating in discussions. To be a good student involves taking an active
role in your education, so speak up!

* * *

FINAL COURSE GRADE

I grade objectively. I do not discriminate on the basis of race, age, gender,
sexual preference, religion, or national origin. I do NOT grade on a curve.
You are NOT competing with each other; you are collaborating. Part of your
grade depends upon how well you listen to and support others. If you wish to
challenge the final grade I assign, you must do so IN WRITING--HARD COPY ONLY.

I will arrive at your grade by combining grades for your self-reflective
writing, essay, short-answer exams, report on non-mainstream activity,
participation, class attendance, and quizzes.

  | Self-reflective writing | 15%  
---|---|---  
| Literary Criticism| 20%  
| Short-answer Essay Exam| 15%  
| Short-answer Essay Exam| 20%  
| Activity Report| 15%  
| Participation| 10%  
| Quizzes| 5%

LATE WORK

I will not accept late work unless previous arrangements have been made. If
you feel that this policy will present a problem you can speak with me or find
another section. If your work is late for legitimate reasons (excused absence,
documented emergency), I will confer with you regarding make-up work.

* * *

QUIZZES

I will give occasional unannounced quizzes on the assigned reading material.
These cannot be made up.

PLAGIARISM AND CHEATING

Plagiarism is the unacknowledged presentation of another's writing or ideas as
your own. This might mean various forms of copying or putting someone else's
ideas in your own words. Plagiarism is intellectual theft. If I discover
plagiarism in anyone's work, I will automatically fail that person for the
assignment in which the plagiarism occurs. Cheating on assignments, exams,
quizzes, tests, will being the same consequence--a failing grade for the
assignment.

General Information**  
**  
Registration:  
** To receive credit for this course, you must register and attend three (3)
sections. The purpose of each is discussed below. The sections are:  

  * a lecture section (sects. 001-002)  

  * a recitation section (sects. 003-024)  

  * a clinic section (sects. 025-054) _(also known as "workshops")_  

**None of these are optional!**  

A laboratory requirement is fulfilled by registering for and attending the
_General Chemistry I Laboratory_ (V25.0103) course. **It is a separate,
2-credit course.**  
**  
Materials:  
**The _required materials_ for this course are:  

  * Textbook - _Chemistry: The Central Science,_ 8th Ed., by Brown, LeMay, and Bursten  

  * Molecular models - A set of molecular models is necessary. The _Foundation Set_ (by Jones and Bartlett Pub.; available at the NYU Book Center) is suggested.  

  * Scientific Calculator - Your calculator must be capable of evaluating logarithms, performing exponentiation, and calculating trigonometric functions. It must have at least an eight-digit display and you must be able to switch _manually_ between scientific notation and decimal notation. Most standard scientific calculators have these features and they are priced as low as $20.  

The _optional materials_ are:  

  * Solutions to Red Exercises (to accompany _Chemistry: The Central Science_ ), by Wilson  

**  
Lectures:**  

The lectures for this course are your primary source of chemical instruction,
course requirements, and class announcements. The schedule of lecture topics
appears on the first page of this syllabus. I will do my best to follow the
schedule; any modifications will be announced during lecture. Attendance is
not taken during lecture. However, to do well in this course you must attend.
I will deviate from the text occasionally and I may emphasize material
differently than does the text.  

Simply attending the lecture is not enough though. The exams and quizzes are
written under the assumption that you have attended lecture _and_ read the
text. In fact, the lecture s will make more sense if you _read the chapter
before attending the corresponding lecture_.  

The lectures have class sizes of approximately 200 and 300. Feel free to raise
your hand to ask a question. However, for more individual attention you should
utilize your recitation and/or clinic classes. _Please be considerate during
lectures and refrain from talking_ (or snoring!).  

The large class size makes it necessary for me to use a computer for all
written and graphical materials. The _basic_ lecture notes are prepared in
advance. Since I will not be writing the presentation by hand, it will be
difficult for you to copy everything into your notebooks at the rate at which
it appears on the screen. Therefore, shrunk down versions of the lecture notes
are available to you in advance. You may purchase copies of them at the Unique
Copy Center (on Green St., between 8th and Waverly). These lecture handouts
have certain portions deleted (e.g., some example solutions, some definitions)
so that you _will_ need to remain alert and do _some_ writing. In addition,
the handouts have LOTS of margin space so that you can add additional
information from the lecture (as I said, just the _basic_ notes are prepared).
I tend to say a LOT more than the lecture notes do, so that there are plenty
of things for you to write down. The handout is not the complete lecture, nor
is it a duplicate of the text. It will certainly **not** replace attending the
lecture. On the other hand, a combination of the handout (with extra notes
added) and the text will serve as an excellent study tool for the exams and
quizzes (and MCATs, if they lie in your future).

**Recitations:  
**

Recitations are intended to provide a small class environment where you can
ask questions that require answers too extensive or specific for the lecture
setting. In other words, this is where you get more individual attention. You
can ask questions about lecture material or homework assignments. The
instructors are either graduate students or our best advanced undergraduates.
All of them are experienced teachers and chemists.  

Recitations meet once per week for 1:15. Most of that time is yours to ask
questions. The last 10 minutes is devoted to a weekly quiz that allows you,
and us, to gauge how well you are doing in the course. Your instructor has
been told to restrict the quiz to exactly 10 minutes so that all sections have
the same amount of time (so don't argue with them about it). Since the quiz is
designed to last for 10 minutes, it has a different format than the
examinations. However, if you do well on the quizzes, you will probably do
well on the exams. If you do not do well on the quizzes, then you definitely
need to get help **before** the exam!  

Your recitation instructor will have weekly office hours. Make sure that you
know where and when you can meet with them. This is your opportunity for true
individual attention.  

Transfers between recitation sections is discouraged and will require written
permission from me (Prof. Halpin). There will be **no transfers allowed during
the first three weeks of the semester**. If after having tried your section
for three class meetings, you present a reasonable request for transfer, I
will consider it. Taking a quiz in another section to replace a missed quiz or
to avoid missing a quiz will also require _written permission_ from me.
_Unauthorized transfers or quizzes will result in no credit_. Most of the
recitation sections are already filled to capacity and these restrictions are
necessary in order to preserve the "small class" format.

**Clinics:  
**

The clinics are another small class environment, though the emphasis is on
students working together. The instructors are our best advanced
undergraduates. It is intended that they act as moderators, while you and a
few other students team up to work on problems. _This is one of the best ways
to study chemistry._ It is called _cooperative learning_. **Attendance is
taken at your clinic and it is mandatory that you attend and contribute.** You
might try getting together with your group outside of class as well to
complete your homework and study.  

**_The clinics will begin on Friday, Sept. 22_**. A clinic week always begins
on Friday and concludes on a Thursday. There are no clinics on weeks that
would begin with an exam day (no clinics 10/13 - 10/19 and 11/10 - 11/16).
Students registered for Thursday clinic section will need to make up for the
Thanksgiving holiday on some other day of **7th** _clinic week_ (i.e., between
11/17 and 11/22). Students registered for a Friday clinic section will need to
make up for the day after Thanksgiving holiday on some other day of the
**8th** _clinic week_ (i.e., between 11/27 and 11/30). The last clinic week
will be 12/8 - 12/13. Students registered for a Wednesday clinic section will
need to make up for their last clinic (12/13) on another day of the **10th**
_clinic week_ (i.e., between 12/8 and 12/13) because 12/13 runs as a Thursday
at NYU!

**The Course Web Page:**  

There is a page for this course within the NYU World Wide Web site. The URL to
use is  
http://www.nyu.edu/classes/inorg  
An account with the NYU Information Technology Services (ITS) has been
established for each student in the course so that you will be able to access
an appropriate computer even if you do not own one.  

The web page contains the syllabus (i.e., this document), the names of the
recitation instructors and contact information, a list of auxiliary materials
and internet links, the homework assignment list, numerical answers to the
latest homework assignment, and, **most importantly** , a list of _class
announcements_. In this last item, I will post information about the course
that you need to know, such as exam locations, what is available on reserve at
Bobst, which lecture notes are available, which sets of homework answers are
available, etc. I'll keep it up to date and it will be a lot easier to access
"the page" than to find me, so you really ought to use it.  

**I will NOT be putting the lecture notes on the web page.**  
This is _NOT_ a "distance learning" course.

**Problem Sets:**  

The homework assignments and their due dates will be given to you during the
first lecture. You must carry out the assignments and hand them in to your
recitation instructor on the due dates in order to receive credit. The
homework that you turn in must be legible, with problem numbers listed, with
work leading to your answers shown, on stapled pages, with your name and your
NYU ID number. The homework is worth only a few percentage points of your
grade. However, those points might make the difference between two letter
grades. More importantly, _if you don't do the homework, you will not perform
well on the quizzes and exams._ No matter how well (you think) you understand
the material, unless you can rapidly and correctly solve problems, you will
not do well in this course. You must practice and gain the experience _before_
the quizzes and exams.  

Late homework will not be accepted. Medical excuses for missed recitations do
not cover homework. If you miss a recitation, turn in your homework at the
next meeting. Of course, it will be accepted at that later date _only_ if you
missed the previous recitation.  

Numerical answers to the homework problems will be posted on the course
webpage. This is so that you can determine if your answer is correct or not.
If it is not correct, and you do not know how to correct it, _ask about that
problem in your next recitation class_. Do not try to obtain copies of the
complete solutions because, while they might make perfect sense once you see
them, you will not gain anything from the problem unless you work it out
yourself.

**Missed Quizzes and Exams:  
**

Everyone gets sick occasionally. I know that. Yet statistical evidence shows
that students are especially susceptible to contagions just before an exam.
Until medical research leads to a preventative for these regular epidemics, I
have a few rules to help you to maintain your health. The first rule is:
unless you can produce verifiable documentation on a physician's stationery
that specifically states that you were too ill to attend _on the date of a
quiz or exam_ , the missed work counts as a zero (0). Long sad stories, notes
from your mom, and even visible injuries are not sufficient. If you have
always been the stoic type who never visits a doctor, I suggest you start to
seek medical attention when you are ill. _**All_ documentation should be given
directly to Prof. Halpin**. _All_ documentation should be annotated to show
what work you missed and should show the section number and instructor's name.
_All_ documentation is subject to verification. I will need to _keep_ the
documentation, so if you'll need it for another course, make a (good) copy for
me. If you miss a quiz or a midterm exam for medical reasons, you will **not**
be given a make-up (that means **no make-ups** ), but I will adjust your other
scores to account for your absence. This means that everything else counts a
little more for you (Caution: This may be hazardous to your GPA). If you miss
the final exam on December 22 _and_ you provide acceptable documentation, you
may take a make-up in May 2001. Yes, I am strict about this. But it's the
least that I can do to safeguard your health and help you to avoid those nasty
pre-test illnesses.  

If you have a Friday recitation and miss a quiz, or if you know in advance
that you will miss a Wednesday recitation, then you can obtain written
permission from Prof. Halpin to take the quiz, for that occasion, in another
section. If you need to attend a different clinic for one week, you may obtain
permission from Cesar Grullon or Julie Kaplan (in 1001 Main) to attend an
alternate section _at which you must get written verification from the
instructor that you attended and participated_. **You are limited to a maximum
of two (2) clinic make-ups per semester** (the Thanksgiving and 12/13 make-ups
don't count as one of these two).

**Conduct:  
**

If you are caught cheating in this course, you will receive a grade of F and
your actions will be reported to the Dean of your school. Cheating in this
course has some of the characteristics of an arms race. Every once in a while,
someone invents a new method to cheat and, shortly afterward, we develop a
method to detect it. However, unlike a real arms race (where destruction is
mutual) _only you can get hurt_ in this case. You can destroy your entire
career in an attempt to score a few extra points. Think about that. It isn't
worth it. This _has_ happened three times in the last four years. Let us not
have an incident this year!  

Cheating includes carrying _any_ unauthorized written material during a quiz
or exam, storing _any_ information in your calculator (which we'll check for),
talking to _anyone_ other than an instructor during a quiz or exam, copying
work from another student, changing an answer on a quiz or exam after it has
been graded, and anything else that would give you an unfair advantage over
other members of the class.

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have a documented disability, you can arrange to take quizzes and/or
exams at the _Center for Students with Disabilities_ (240 Greene Street, 4th
Floor). It is your responsibility to make arrangements with that office and
with me before the first quiz or exam.

**Religious Holidays:  
** If you have a religious obligation that prevents you from attending, I
recognize your right to miss class. The procedure for a quiz or exam is
similar to that for medical excuses, except that _you_ can write the
documentation. Please specify the date of the absence, the reason (i.e., what
holiday), and give the section number for your recitation. Clinics missed for
religious reasons must be made-up. Therefore, you should speak with Cesar
Grullon or Julie Kaplan (1001 Main) **in advance** and they will arrange an
alternate clinic for you to attend that week.

**Grading:  
**

You will be graded according to a fixed point scale. There are no curves,
there is no reason to compete with your colleagues, and you _might_ all get
_A_ 's if the grades are high! The point values for the course components are:  
QUIZZES| ..........| 60 points  
---|---|---  
HOMEWORK| ..........| 20 points  
CLINICS| ..........| 40 points  
EXAM 1| ..........| 90 points  
EXAM 2| ..........| 90 points  
FINAL EXAM| ..........| 100 points  
TOTAL| ..........| 400 points  
  
The grading scheme will be:  
370-400| ..........| A  
---|---|---  
350-369| ..........| A-  
330-349| ..........| B+  
305-329| ..........| B  
285-304| ..........| B-  
265-284| ..........| C+  
240-264| ..........| C  
220-239| ..........| C-  
200-219| ..........| D  
< 200| ..........| F  
  
I reserve the right to lower the cutoff numbers (making it easier), but I will
not raise them. However, don't count on them changing at all.

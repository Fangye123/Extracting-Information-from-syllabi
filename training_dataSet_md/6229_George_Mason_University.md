**DESCRIPTION**

**The course will present data communications fundamentals and computer
networking methods, using the ISO 7-layer reference model to organize the
study. Attention will be focused on the protocols of the physical, data link
control, network, and transport layers, for local and wide area networks.
Emphasis will be given to the Internet Protocol Suite. Students will program
simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project.**

**Prerequisites: CS571 and STAT344 or equivalent; ability to program in
C/C++.**

**Project: We will use the Network Workbench (NW), software developed at GMU
that simulates a protocol stack and displays the results, using a text
interface. Students will create modules for Internet stack layers and run them
in the NW environment. NW will be available via IT &E computing labs in
ST2-18, 133, and 137 and by dial-in. A version that runs under Borland C++
Builder (version 5) and Microsoft Visual C++ (version 6) also is available.
Well documented code must be submitted by email to the TA for grading (submit
the module you programmed, plus diskout.txt, as ATTACHMENTS CLEARLY LABELED
WITH FILE NAMES). Additional projects are available for extra credit. The
CS656 Project TA is Rong Wang, email rwang@cs.gmu.edu, office hours 1600 to
1800 Monday and 1600 to 1800 Wednesday in room 365 S&T2. She also is available
by appointment at other times, for example after class (send email at least 24
hours in advance to set up appointment).**

**The project is documented in one of the required texts. Copies of class
slides, software and documentation for the project are included with this text
on CDROM. Additional project information will be found at
http://netlab.gmu.edu/NW.**  


**GRADING POLICY**

**Midterm exam 30%, Project 35%, Final exam 35%.**

**Project credit breakout: DLC1, DLC2, DLC3, LAN1, WAN2, TRN1 and INT3 five
points each; extra credit LAN2, WAN3, WAN4, INT1, and INT2 two points each.**

**Missed exams must be arranged with the instructor BEFORE the exam date.**

**Assignments are due by 7:30PM on assigned date. Late assignments lose 10%
per class credit.**

**All students are expected to abide by the Honor Code as stated in the GMU
catalog and elaborated for Computer Science.**

**Grading is proficiency-based (no curve), cutoffs will be in the vicinity of
(but not higher than) A   93; A- 90; B+ 87; B 83; B - 80; C 70.** ****

**Extra credit is available by doing extra projects, however no student who
fails the final exam will receive a grade higher than C, regardless of extra
credit earned.**

**Course notices and assignments will be provided via email. Students are
responsible to have an email account and provide an address to the instructor.
osf1.gmu.edu or other email addresses may also be used. Course materials (for
example, homework solutions) will be available though the course webpage,
http://netlab.gmu.edu/compnets. Students are responsible for assigned readings
and all material outlined in lecture slides.**

**Internet-based course delivery: classes will be available on computer

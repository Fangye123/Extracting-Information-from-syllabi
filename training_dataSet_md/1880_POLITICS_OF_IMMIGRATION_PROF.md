**OBJECTIVE**

Today a record number of people are leaving their home countries and migrating
to other nations or spending part of their lives in refugee camps. There are
many reasons for this, including civil war, ethnic strife, natural disasters,
the breakdown of communist block, economic pressures and the simple hope for a
better life. These massive population movements are generating complex
problems for national and international policy makers as well as the migrants
themselves. The purpose of this course is to examine the causes and impact of
international migration and the public policy issues that are created by the
movement of people from one nation to another. Students should complete this
course with the ability to understand and analyze international and United
States' policy development on immigration.

"Every year millions of people leave their countries, fleeing violence,
discrimination or repressive regimes; searching for employment; or eager to
join their families. These flows are truly global as people move from south to
north, from east to west, and from one developing country to another. Some
countries welcome immigrants; others merely permit them to enter; still others
do what they can to seal their borders. Some governments see migrants taking
jobs that others do not want, adding cultural diversity, and often
invigorating the economy through their enterprise. They particularly welcome
migrants with whom they have a special cultural kinship. But more often,
governments fear that migration will mean a loss of jobs for their citizens,
cultural swamping, ethnic conflict, and higher welfare costs. They regard
migrants as a threat to their political stability and national security and as
a source of conflicts with other states. Weiner, _The Global_ _Migration
Crisis_

> Exams will be essay and the final exam will be cumulative. Students will be
responsible for one policy paper of 10 to 12 pages (for detail information
click here). Required class participation includes regular attendance,
prepared discussion in class and completion of in-class and out-of-class
exercises. Much of the material which will be covered in class is not fully
covered in the texts.

> All assignments not completed on time will be given a "0." Makeup exams or
extra time for other assignments will only be given under extraordinary
circumstances and will require prior discussion with the instructor (with the
exception of emergencies which will require documentation). Extra-credit may
be earned by analyzing additional journal articles (see class handout for
further information). No extra credit analyses will be accepted after December
3.

**CLASS FORMAT**

> Most class sessions will include a lecture and/or discussion on the assigned
topic. Everyone is expected to read the assignments before class and to come
to class ready to discuss that day's readings. There will also be some in-
class assignments (e.g. group discussions and brief presentation on a
particular reading) and out-of-class assignments. Your class participation
grade depends on your presence and the quality and quantity of your verbal
contributions. I understand that in-class participation is difficult for some
students, but your learning experience is often directly proportional to your
participation. Quality of participation is more critical than quantity.

>  
>

> Class etiquette is also important. First, please come to class on time. If
you need to arrive late on occasion, please feel free to enter the classroom
quietly. I would rather have you in class for part of the time than not at
all. Second, please come to class ready to focus on the topic under
discussion. It is rude to whisper back and forth on other topics, work on
other assignments or read the _Alligator_. It is a distraction for everyone in
the room. Finally, all beepers and cell phones should be turned off during the
class (the sole exception to this is an urgent family emergency).

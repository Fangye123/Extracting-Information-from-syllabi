Description:** This course introduces you to major political, economic, and
social changes in the United States from the time of European "discovery" to
the Civil War. It will help you to develop analytical skills [not just what
happened, but some of the reasons why] as well as learning how to articulate
your ideas both verbally and in writing. We will look at major events such as
the American Revolution, rapid economic expansion, and the growth of sectional
tensions from the point of view of the ordinary American.

At the end of this course students will be able to:

> > _

>>

>> Summarize_ the major events in American history through 1865

>>

>> _

>>

>> Analyze_ primary source documents

>>

>> _

>>

sound position on an historical topic

>>

>> _

>> Compare_ historical events from the perspective of different groups and
account for any variation

**

Requirements:** You will have 5 assignments on class readings other than the
Brinkley text, 3 will be quizzes and 2 short response papers. The quizzes will
take a variety of forms (short answer, true/false, multiple choice, etc.). In
the 1 page papers you might be asked to identify the historical significance
of a particular source and explain your choice [why is this document
important? How does it help us to better understand the past?], or to write on
any of the themes of the text itself. These papers will prepare you for class
discussion as well as the exams. There are 5 of these assignments on the
syllabus. You must complete 4 of the 5. If you choose to complete more than 4,
the 4 highest scores will be used to compute your grade.

There will be 2 in-class exams and a final exam.

Course Policies**: You are expected to attend all lectures (as per new
university policy, attendance will be taken) and to complete the readings
before the first class meeting each week. Attendance and participation are
assigned as a part of your grade. After two absences you will begin to lose
points. If you will be gone for job related requirements, sporting events,
doctor=s appointments, illness, etc. use these two Afree@ absences.

Any absences after two will only be excused at the instructor=s discretion and
in extreme circumstances (hospitalization, death in the family, etc.) and with
appropriate documentation. Please do not e-mail me telling me you will be
absentBthat is why you get two freebies. After two absences, if you feel that
you have extenuating circumstances warranting an excuse, please come and see
me in person during office hours.

Response papers assigned as homework are due at the beginning class. Late
assignments will lose one-third of a grade for each day they are late,
including weekends and holidays. Make-ups and late papers are allowed only in
exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation.

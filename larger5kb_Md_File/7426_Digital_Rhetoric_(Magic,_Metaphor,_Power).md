**Description**

What are we talking about when we talk about the internet? How does language
structure our opinions of the internet and its relationship to culture? This
class surveys current discourse (utopic, dystopic, and other strands) about
the internet as it shapes and is shaped by a variety of competing forces.

The first part of the course will focus on recent digitally-inflected notions
of narrative and interactivity (with a special interest in"materiality" in
relation to a conference being held on campus in October). The second part of
the course will pay special attention to issues of and interdisciplinary
arguments about governance,  
identity, and community. While we will attend to the historical specificity of
the internet, we will also reach back, as needed, to consider the critical
reception of the telegraph, the telephone, radio, and so on.

The readings for the course will mix theoretical texts with print-and Web-
based cultural journalism and videos from fields such associology, computer
science, art, film, and literature.

Course work will include regular responses to the readings, a collaborative
project, and a significant paper on a topic of interest.

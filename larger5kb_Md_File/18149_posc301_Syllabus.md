**State and Local Politics**

**Purpose:** These are especially important times to become more knowledgeable
about the politics and policies of state and local governments and their
interactions with the federal government. As events   in Florida this past
presidential election illustrated, state politics and policies play a vital
role in elections.  Ongoing energy problems in California point out that
states are responsible for important basic services.   This course will
address these issues while engaging in a critical examination of state and
local governments and their governing capacities within the context of the
debate over the proper size and scope of the federal government and the
"devolution revolution." We will explore the social and economic
characteristics, legal structures, political processes, fiscal strength,
leadership resources, and policy choices of state and local governments. The
overall emphasis will be on understanding similarities and differences among
the states, the possible impacts of changes at the federal level on state
politics and public policies, and interpreting current events in state and
local politics.

Students will have the opportunity to act out their own strategies for
political influence and community leadership during a role playing simulation
of decisionmaking in a medium sized city. Active class participation is
**necessary** during the simulation and is encouraged throughout the semester.

**Books:** Available at the University bookstore.

**Grading:** There will be three exams based on readings and lectures. These
exams will include short answer and essay questions and will require both
recall and synthesis of course material. Each exam will count for 20% of the
final grade. Two papers are also required. One paper, on the local government
of your hometown, will count 25%. The other   paper, worth 10%, is based on
the role playing simulation . The remaining 10% of the grade will be based on
how well you play your role during the simulation. _Attendance during the role
playing simulation is required_. You will lose 5% from your final grade if you
miss more than 1 class during the simulation without approved excuses.

The paper assignments are described more fully at the end of this syllabus.
Please note due dates. Please plan ahead and start working on the  local
government paper immediately.  
    


ASSIGNMENTS

Students are encouraged to read a daily newspaper and to bring articles
related to state and local politics to class to share. I often hand out copies
of articles of current interest. If you miss class, check with the teaching
assistant for missed handouts. You are responsible for these at exam time.

**Local Government Paper**

In 4 - 7 typed, double-spaced pages describe, critique and **analyze** your
hometown's governmental arrangements, political life and current issues. The
paper should indicate that you are aware of the current state of public
affairs in your community regardless of how exciting or mundane they may be.
In the past students have used local newspapers, parents, neighbors, and
public officials as sources of information. Do not hesitate to call your
government offices (city hall or township office) for information. Most of
them have printed information describing the basic structure of the local
governments, current office holders and budgets. If you interview the mayor or
some other official, be aware that his or her perspective may not be the only
one. Do not rely on one interview as your only source of information. You may
mention (this means **very** briefly) physical, demographic and historical
features you think are important influences on current politics and life in
your community.

The emphasis in this paper should be on analysis and evaluation of your
current local government, what the important issues are and how well  your
local government is addressing them. **HINT:** Review the readings from the
local government section of the syllabus. Do some of the questions or themes
raised in the readings apply to your local government and politics? Beyond
this general hint, here are some questions that you should answer in your
paper. What is the structure of your local general purpose government?   Are
there any special districts which provide services to residents? How are local
politics conducted ( e.g., highly partisan, open or by small clique)?  Do you
have any recommendations for changing the politics, policies or governmental
structures in your hometown?  


**Simulation Paper - Papers are due April 5 th in class.**

Describe the important characteristics of the role you are to play during the
simulation.  Which issues are important to your role?  How would you define
"success" for this role? How do you plan to be successful in your role?  What
tactics, strategies or political style will you try out? Will it be an easy or
hard role to play? Why?

Papers should be about 3-5 pages in length.

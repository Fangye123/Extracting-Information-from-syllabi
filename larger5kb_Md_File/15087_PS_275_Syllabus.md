         This seminar seeks to understand the origin, importance, and consequences of political parties (especially, the two major political parties) in the United States.  The typical kinds of questions we will investigate include, "Why are there political parties?" "When and how might they 'matter,' and, if they do, to whom?" and "How, if at all, are they related to the workings of democracy?"  Political parties likely have attracted and continue to attract as much normative as scientific questioning (to the extent these are separable domains).  Here, we will focus primarily on the scientific.  Doing so is especially appropriate in this case.  That is because political parties are not -- at least in the U.S. -- institutions separate from the politics of this republican democracy.  In rational choice parlance, political parties are "endogenous" to democracy, that is to the citizens and politicians.  To ask normative questions about parties, therefore, is actually to ask normative questions about democracy.  Thus, to attach normative values to political parties, per se, requires a "scientific" understanding of their role in democracy.  As a result, whether your interest is normative or scientific or both, you must understand political parties scientifically and you must do so first before you can judge them normatively. 

         There are, it seems to me, two ways to study the major American political party.  One could study them in comparison to political parties elsewhere, or one could study them in historical perspective.  Both ways are valuable.  We will examine them in (cross-national) comparative perspective in an early section that examines different kinds of "party systems" (in quotes, because that phrase has several meanings) and their relationship to the larger governmental and electoral settings.  There remains, of course a lot more to the (cross-national) comparative study of political parties.  We will assess the major U.S. party in historical perspective (which is, after all, a "longitudinal" rather than "cross-sectional" version of comparative politics).  I do so because a) I enjoy doing so, and b) it is my belief that historical sequencing (aka "path dependence" or "political development") is important -- probably in general in politics, but likely to be especially so in the case of political parties. 

         We will begin with an introductory section that includes consideration of some of the current views of the problems of American politics and by some definitions of (American, major) political parties.  We will then look at three topics in comparative parties:  some basic perspectives; electoral institutions and party systems; and democratic forms and political parties.  The two major topics, then, are first the relationship between elections and the number of political parties; what is commonly called "Duverger's Laws."  The second examines the relationship between the larger set of governmental and constitutional rules, using the (slightly dated but still major) work of the immediate past President of APSA (Arend Lijphart). 

         We then examine a portion of the actual history of American parties, but do so in a way that raises three themes, the topics of the three subsections.  The first is the importance of ideas, especially in the formation of republican-democratic institutions.  The second looks at "time's arrow," that is looks at institutional development and change in a way more or less monotonic with time. The third topic is "time's cycles," or repetition, cycling, or at least discontinuities in history that fundamentally break the monotonic "march of history." 

         The next three sections look a political party in its contemporary guise (the parts that I find substantively interesting, and about which most have been written).  First, we look at various theories of party identification and the possibility that party in elections means something different from party in the electorate, touching also on so-called party "decline" and its possible resurgence.  The next section looks at theories and applications of said theories about parties in governance.  The final section actually builds on the preceding and is fully empirical.  It looks at what parties in government are presumed to do while governing -- make policy.  Here we will look at some of the evidence that appears to argue that parties may not make much different in policy making in the U.S., especially the argument of David Mayhew. 

          ** _Assignments:_**   We will discuss these in class, but expect grading to be based on seminar participation and a substantial paper (or a jointly agreed upon substitute, such as three shorter not-original-research papers).  The former requires having completed the readings in advance of the class, and thus, you are graded in part by how successful the class is.  The original research paper would be circa 25-30 pages.  The topic, on a subject arising out of the course, must be approved and a proposal turned in prior to November 1.  The paper (or alterntive) must be turned in by the regularly scheduled final.   
  Readings:  I have ordered nine books (all in paper).  You may want to
consider alternative strategies, especially with respect to Niemi and Weisberg
(we are selecting only a portion of the collection reprinted here, these are
excerpts rather than full reprints, and you may have already or want the full
length, feature versions), the Gimple (recommended) and the Shafer books
(these are not particularly "keepers on the shelf" type of books, or things
you will need to review for Ph.D. exams, but topical books), and the Shepsle
and Weingast reader (we are reading only a few of the selections, all were
published in LSQ).  Articles are also to be arranged. The books are:

Stanford  
 University Press, 1988).

list of some overall goals we strive for in this course:  
        The students shall develop an appreciation of mathematics, its history and its applications.   
        The students shall become confident in their own ability to do mathematics.   
        The students shall become mathematical problem solvers.   
        The students shall learn to communicate mathematical content.   
        The students shall learn to reason mathematically.

This course is aimed at the needs of elementary education majors and as such
is the first part of a three-course, 12-credit sequence (MATH 155-255-355).
This is a "content" course rather than a "methods" course (teaching methods
are addressed in the latter two courses in the above sequence). It is what
people generally call a "Liberal Arts Mathematics Course", meaning that it
covers a wide variety of topics, has an emphasis on problem solving, and uses
a historical and humanistic approach. Consequently, the course is considered
appropriate for the general education requirements and is open to all
students.

There will be a few assignments not generally included in a mathematics
course, but which will, I hope, make your experience in this class more well-
rounded than in a typical algebra course. These include the following:

**_Mathematical Autobiography_** : Due: Monday, September 13. _Point value:
25._ This will be a 3-5 page paper in which you explore your life as a math
student. I think it is especially appropriate for education majors to reflect
on your past mathematical life, and to consider what methods and styles worked
for you in the classrooms throughout your K-12 career. Try to be specific and
try not to make this a "blame the teacher" paper.

**_Portfolio_** : Due: Friday, December 10. _Point value: 40_. It is important
to an artist or a photographer to assemble a "portfolio", a collection of
their work which is representative of their skills and interests. The same is
true for a student of mathematics. During this course you will be working many
problems, some of which will be "breakthrough" efforts, when you finally
understood how to do something or which you are proud of because your write-up
was so well done. You will choose FIVE problems along the way which you want
to include in your portfolio; for each of these problems you will include a
nicely organized re-write of the problem along with a brief reflection paper
on why you chose that particular problem and on what you learned from the
problem. Each of the five problems (the write-up and the reflection paper
combined) will be worth 8 points. I expect at least one page for each problem.

**_Group Labs_** : At a number of points during the course you will be working
on a "lab" in small groups. I believe that students learn in a variety of
ways, and that while studying alone can be valuable, for many working on
problems in small groups can enhance student learning significantly. Even
though you will be working in a group of three or four people, each person
should turn in a paper; I want to see each person's expression of the
solutions to the problems \- and if you each get a graded paper back it will
give you something to study from. It is important that each person contributes
their input into these labs. I will randomly assign groups, although I am
willing to consider rearranging them as time passes, when, for example, a
student drops the course. It happens.

The grading procedure is quite straight-forward. "A" = 90% or more of total
possible points, "AB" = 87% or more, "B" = 80% or more, "BC" = 77% or more,
"C" = 70% or more, "CD" = 67% or more, and "D" = 60% or more. We will probably
end up with about 800 possible points. My advice is simple: if you wish to
earn a decent grade, make sure that you keep up with your work and that you
turn in ALL the papers which are to be graded. I find that the surest way to
receive less than a "C" is to make sure you miss some classes and fail to turn
in all your work!

Attendance is important in this class. There is really never a "good day" to
miss because we will either be covering new material or working in groups on
some problems. I will not formally reduce your grade for poor attendance, but
I will take attendance throughout the course so that I can apply the 2-day
rule when we take those practice exams (see above). I can also tell you that
poor attendance is one of the best ways to hurt you overall chances of
success.

Late assignments is also something you should avoid. For one thing, if I am
going to be able to get your work graded in a timely fashion so that it will
do you some good for study purposes, you need to get it turned in on time.
Another reason is that since we will be moving from one topic to the next, it
is important that you are not spending your time doing work you should have
done a week or two earlier instead of focusing on what we are doing at the
moment. Therefore, I have a rule on late assignments: 10% of the total point
value of a given assignment will be subtracted from your score for each of the
first 3 days past the due date. Beyond 3 class periods, I will no longer
accept late work. In general it is better to turn in work even if it is not
entirely finished than to hold on to it.

Final Comments: I believe firmly that you as the student are the learner, and
that "to learn" is an active verb; you must be actively engaged in the
learning process, and this is best accomplished by your DOING mathematics. I
am not here to show you how much I know - I am here to be "a guide on the
side, not a sage on the stage". Please feel free to ask questions in class,
either of me or of your group-mates. Please feel free to come to my office to
discuss problems you might be having. Please feel free to go visit the
learning center for tutoring help if necessary. The bottom line is that you
must take responsibility for your own learning. Please believe that
"Mathematics is not a spectator sport!"

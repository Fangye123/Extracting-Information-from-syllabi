**Mission Statement of the Darden College of Education**  
  
Old Dominion University's major purpose in its education program is to prepare
individuals who have knowledge of their discipline, ability to practice state-
of-the-art instruction with students of various cultural and socioeconomic
backgrounds, and attitudes which reflect commitment to teaching and learning
as well as lifelong professional growth and development.  
  
**Course Description**  
  
This course introduces general education teachers to the legal and educational
needs of teaching students at risk and with disabilities. Emphasis is placed
on characteristics of students with special needs and procedures for effective
academic, behavioral, and social integration of these children in the general
education classroom. (Lecture 3 hours; 3 credits) Prerequisite: junior
standing  
  
**Course Purpose**  
  
The purpose of this course is to prepare the professional educator to
effectively teach the range of students found in the typical public school
classroom. This range includes the special needs of students who are disabled,
gifted and talented, culturally diverse and/or students at risk for school
failure. The intent of the course is to examine the educational program of
inclusion and to clarify the roles and responsibilities of professional
educators who serve mildly disabled and other special needs students. The
focus is on knowledge of current research and "best practices" for
accommodating special needs students in the mainstream and collaborating with
special education and other support personnel to develop effective
instructional programs. This course will afford the professional educator the
opportunity to improve practices and extend his/her career commitment.  
  
**Course Competencies**  
  
Upon successful completion of the course, the student will possess the skills
necessary to:  
  
1\. Define related terms such as integration, mainstreaming, least restrictive
environment, at risk, inclusion, and special education.  
2\. Delineate and apply effective teaming skills, roles and problem solving
techniques.  
3\. Specify learner characteristics of special needs students, gather
information about them, and identify approaches for individual success.  
4\. Discuss current research practices and issues related to integration,
mainstreaming, inclusion, and accommodating special needs students.  
5\. Describe the history of progressive inclusion of students with special
needs.  
6\. Describe effective teaching strategies for environmental, curricular, and
behavioral adaptations for special needs students in any subject area.  
7\. Specify evaluation and grading procedures available and alternative
practices involving students with special needs.  
8\. Identify legislation specific to special education and the process defined
therein (to include IEPs, continuum of placement options, referral, evaluation
and eligibility process, and 504 plans).  
9\. Describe the preparation process for mainstreaming students into the less
restrictive environment(s).  
10\. Practice within the CEC Code of Ethics and other standards and policies
of the profession.  
11\. Demonstrate awareness of the potential for cultural mismatch and bias in
order to adjust your assessment, instruction and curricula to reflect a
variety of cultural experiences and languages.  
  
**Course Requirements/Evaluation Procedures**  
  
******_Chapter Tests._** **** There will **** be a test following
approximately every three chapters. This is done to maximize retention of
course content. Each test is based on assigned readings, lectures, class
discussion and assignments and is worth 15 points. Tests are similar in
format: multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short answer. The final exam
is cumulative, short answer essay, and counts for 20 points.  
  
**_Course Project._** Each ESSE 506 student will negotiate with the instructor
to pursue a learning experience that relates directly to their professional
major/needs or scholarly interests and to the objectives of the course. A
signed contract will be prepared prior to the midterm that outlines the course
project and will accompany the final product for a total of 25 points.
Alternative Option: The student may choose to present a class lecture on a
specific topic as scheduled during the session, e.g., cooperative learning.
**(Due Date: April 11)** ** __**  
  
******_Journal Reviews._** Each ESSE 406 student will submit five journal
reviews of articles related to their professional major/needs or scholarly
interest and the objectives of the course. The content of the review will
follow the attached format and will be submitted on one single-spaced typed
page. Each journal review will be worth 5 points for a total of 25 points.
**(Due Dates: Jan. 29; Feb. 14, 28; March 19; April 4)**  
  
******_Course Notebook._** Each student will maintain a course
journal/notebook according to the instructor's procedures. It will contain a
minimum of 10 reflections regarding the course topics, news articles, media
presentations, web searches, etc. The notebook will be checked for a total of
10 points. **(Due Date: April 18)**  
  
******_Grading._** Total points accumulated during the semester represent a
quantitative measure of performance. Qualitative aspects, e.g., class
attendance, preparedness, participation, and clarity of written assignments,
will be taken into account in the assignment of the final grade.  
Grading Scale: |  93 - 100 points = A| 79 - 77 = C+  
---|---  
92 - 90 = A-| 76 - 73 = C  
89 - 87 = B+| 72 - 70 = C-  
86 - 83 = B| 69 - 60 = D  
82 - 80 = B-| Below 60 = F

**Students with Special Needs**  
  
In accordance with institutional policy, a student who wishes to receive some
instructional accommodation, because of a documented sensory and/or learning
disability, should meet with the instructor to discuss those accommodations.  
  
**Attendance**  
  
Regular attendance and participation is viewed favorably in borderline grades.
Absence from class has a negative influence on learning and mastery of course
content. Much of the content for the completion of assignments is provided
through lecture and discussion. This information will not be readily obtained
if the learner does not attend. If a student must miss a class, he/she is
expected to follow the course syllabus and have the initiative necessary to
cover properly the material missed. **The student must meet all course
deadlines and be present for all class presentations and tests.**  
  
**Honor Pledge**  
  
In all course activities and assignments the honor system of Old Dominion
University applies: students are required to record the honor pledge on all
material submitted. If plagiarism or any other violation of the honor system
occurs, the student will receive a "0" on the assignment.  
  
_"I pledge to support the honor system of Old Dominion University. I will
refrain from any form of academic dishonesty or deception, such as cheating or
plagiarism. I am aware that as a member of the academic community, it is my
responsibility to turn in all suspected violators of the honor system. I will
report to Honor Council hearings if summoned."_  
  
By attending ODU, you have accepted the responsibility to abide by this code.
This is an institutional policy approved by the Board of Visitors.  
  
**Code of Student Conduct**  
  
"University students shall conduct themselves in a manner compatible with the
university's educational mission and shall be disciplined for misconduct
adversely affecting that mission." Appropriate conduct by students is assumed
in the college classroom. Students do not have the right to engage in behavior
which is disruptive in the classroom and guidelines are designed to provide
faculty members with options when confronted with disruptive students.  
  
**Withdrawal**  
  
A syllabus constitutes a contract between the student and the course
instructor. Participation in this course indicates your acceptance of its
teaching focus, requirements, and policies. Please preview this syllabus and
the course requirements _as soon as possible_ If you believe that the nature
of this course does not meet your interests, needs, or expectations, if you
are not prepared for the amount of work involved-or if you anticipate that the
class meetings, assignment deadlines or abiding by the course policies will
constitute an unacceptable hardship for you-you should drop the class by the
drop/add deadline, which is located in the ODU Schedule of Classes.  
  
**Use of APA style for Written Work**  
  
Special education professionals take pride in producing written work that is
free of errors in punctuation, spelling, grammar and syntax. All written work
in this course must conform to the writing style used by professionals in
special education, i.e., the writing style of the American Psychological
Association (APA). For general guidelines regarding the use of APA style,
please see the web sites that follow. For specific issues, please reference
the _Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association_ (5th ed.),
available in the reference section of ODU library.

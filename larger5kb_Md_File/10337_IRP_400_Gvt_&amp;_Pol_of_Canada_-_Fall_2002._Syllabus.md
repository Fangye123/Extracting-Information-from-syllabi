**Syllabus  
IRP 400: Government and Politics of Canada  
Instructor, Krisan Evenson  
Fall 2002 - Online course**  

![](maple-leafy.gif)

**This syllabus has information that will change before the course starts, and
for every day during Fall 2002 that we meet. The links will not likely
function yet, and you should check back here as the course evolves.**  

    
* Welcome to IRP 400, the course that will take you to Canada! This syllabus is the **'home base'** of the course, where you'll find all the lecture notes, most of the assignments, and lots of fun and interesting links to help you in this online course. This syllabus with its links is the authority on your obligations for the course. Be sure that you have the correct set of obligations for the course, which has changed somewhat based on the evaluations in past semesters.   
    
* Make sure that you check back to the online version of this syllabus _at minimum_ as often as we have class. I will add web sites, hints for your assignments, details about your main term paper, etc. **DO NOT BE SURPRISED**. (If you print the syllabus, you won't see the changes if/when I make them).   

_Most importantly_ , I will add lecture and class notes on the days of our
virtual classes. Each time you come here, there should be something new. I
upload lecture notes by the class days--Tuesday and Thursday. Because of the
way the academic calendar works, there are two or three times when you'll need
to turn something in on a Friday or Monday, but I'll only subject you (!) to
new material on Tuesdays and Thursdays. If you get an error when you click on
the class notes, chances are I haven't put them up yet, so you should look on
the Announcements page before thinking that something is wrong. Assignments
are due on the days indicated in the syllabus, _regardless_ of your location
on the globe, the current health of your computer, or your vacation plans.
When you do the assignments is up to you, as long as they reach me on the date
indicated. Again, class days are Tuesday and Thursday. The planet I live on
has days of 24-hour length, so you can hand in assignments from 12:01am on
Tuesday until 11:59pm Tuesday night. Same goes for Thursdays.

* * *

**To get the most** out of a growing knowledge of Canada without feeling
overwhelmed, take it a little at a time.  
_**First**_ , check out ["On this Day" ](http://www1.sympatico.ca/cgi-
bin/on_this_day), and find out interesting little tidbits that all happened in
Canada on the day in question. There is a link to this site every day we have
class. For example, "January 18, 1971, in Quebec City, Quebec - Quebec
requires English-language schools in the province to teach French as a second
language."  
_**Second**_ , I will ask you to choose a newspaper in Canada to read
regularly. Visit its website often, so that you begin to get a "feel" for the
place. (I will ask you about which paper you'll be reading early in the term,
and there will be questions for which you will need to have been reading
regularly in order to answer). Treat it as if you moved to a new town, and
wanted to find out about the "local scene." One proviso: make sure it is an
actual newspaper, rather than a site that just gives you the news sweep of the
day (CNN, CBC, Yahoo news, etc., will not cut it).  

* * *

_**Key to the syllabus:**_

To help you navigate the syllabus and course a bit, I've put in some icons.
You'll notice that I'll link lecture notes every class session, and have
bullets for items to check out, and to read. If you click on lecture notes and
they don't come up, it's likely I haven't put them on yet. I've divided each
week by white lines so you can see how things are broken up. Tuesday and
Thursday are class days, with the exceptions noted above. Here are some other
icons:  
![](mapleleaf.gif)**for the "On this Day"** feature for Canadian history.
These icons always come with the link attached, so all you have to do is click
to stay on top of things. Located on the lecture notes. It's the gentle way of
learning Canadian history I mentioned above.  
![](lecture.gif)**for lecture notes**. There are at least one set per day;
sometimes the material lends itself to two sets, because we make a transition,
or the file size is easier to handle.  
![](rdg.checkit.gif)**for reading assignments**. Here are the [required
textbooks](IRP400-F02.texts.htm). Make sure you have the right editions! These
icons appear on the day the reading is **due**. Most textbook chapters are 20
pages or fewer. You'll also notice links to non-textbooks reading assignments,
especially to web pages.  
![](devil01.gif)**for writing assignments**. These little folks appear on the
*day things are **due**.* When you start the assignment is up to you, as long
as they reach me on the date due. They are each less than 1000 words, or about
a page or 2.  
![](yourturn.gif)**for your class comments**. Each class day you'll see this
icon on the lecture notes. Show me that you've prepared and been in class by
sending for-credit comments on the readings and lecture. You should put these
comments on the discussion section of the class website--not only to me but to
the whole class, because that's the point of a discussion. Your comments
should be cogent and worth your classmates' time.  
![](zap3.gif)**for assignments related to the term project**. Each lightning
bolt denotes a step in the term project. Like the devils, these lightning
bolts appear on the *day things are **due**.* When you start the assignment is
up to you, as long as they reach me on the date due. They are either a
paragraph, a statement, or some step in the preparation of the project, to
help you break up the work so that, again, it's not overwhelming.  
  
  
Items indicated by these icons form the basis of your grade. Information about
the assignments related to these icons is located on the "Contract" section of
the website. There is a link to the Contract section below. If you have
questions later about your grade, I will likely refer you there.

    ![](devil01.gif)Assignment. Research the Oka crisis of the early 1990s. How was the situation handled along the borders of the US State of New York, and the Canadian Provinces of Ontario and Quebec? What does this tell you about the variety of political subcultures involved? (just 300 words will do the trick)

    ![](devil01.gif) Please fill out the [**Final Surveys**](psc331sp01.finl.eval.htm). They do help me plan improvements to the course--I'll be offering this course again, and on the survey, I ask you what you think about future formats for the course.   

* **Please check back in to the syllabus and the website.** University College also wants you to fill out for them an anonymous evaluation form. For some reason they have trouble getting people to do this. Demonstrate to them that Canadian(ist)s do not hesitate! (even if you have terrible things to say about me or the course!)

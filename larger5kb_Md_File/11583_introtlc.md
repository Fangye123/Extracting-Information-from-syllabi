**Course Description:**  
    This course serves as an introduction to the different ways in which the different disciplines of the Liberal Arts examine the development and impact of technology. It explores the changes in society, culture and behavior that spur, accompany and react to technology. The course focuses on new and emerging forms of information technology and the issues that surround them. However, it also entails the study of general theory concerning the interaction of technology and culture and the histories of technology that have shaped or serve as comparisons for the world today.   
    This course is required as an introduction for students enrolled in the Technology, Literacy and Culture concentration. At the same time, students not part of the program are encouraged to take this class. It's broad scope and open, seminar format are likely to be insightful to a wide range of majors. As part of this format, students will take part in frequent discussions, a number of collaborative group projects and a variety of online forums. Students are not expected to have prior knowledge of web publishing, web design programs or extensive experience using the web. However, even technophobes will gain competency in their use by the end of this course.   
    Students will be expected to have e-mail and webspace to complete projects and participate in the course. Most assignments will be completed and published online, on personal web space. To be able to publish on the web, you will need a ACITS computer account validated for a UNIX system (if you are already a UT Student) or have web access from a private internet service provider (such as Geocities, AOL or Earthlink).  To open an ACITS  account, or to get an existing one validated for one of these machines, go to the Help Desk or go online [here](http://www.utexas.edu/computer/accounts/). Bring your UT ID. For more information, call the Help Desk at 475-9400. We will cover setting up webspace the first day of class and all students are required to have space up and running by the second class period. We will discuss acquiring free web space from sources like Yahoo, however personal web space at this University and from most service providers is not free. While I personally disagree with this policy, the cost of web space should be equated to the cost of textbooks--they are a necessary expenditure if you take this course.   
    This course is taught in a computer lab and much of the work can be completed during class. However, there will be computer based work that must be done outside of class. Students who use their own computers will need to acquire appropriate software. 

Assignments and Grading  
    All assignments are due at the beginning of the class period. The majority of work will be done, and displayed, online in student's personal web space. A description of assignments is available [here](http://www.tlc.utexas.edu/courses/spring2002/introtlc/assignments.html). No grading curve is used in this course--students have the potential to excel or to fail entirely on their own merits. Final grades will be based on assignments as follows: 

  Class participation                                           15%  
  Web Site                                                         5%  
  The Webby's                                                   15%  
  Non-textual Communication                             15%  
  Internet Development                                       10%  
  LINUX/open source                                        10%  
  Cell/Wireless Ethnography                               30%

    The course is arbitrarily deemed as worth 1000 points, so an assignment worth 25% of the grade will be worth 250 points. Letter grades are given on a strict A-B-C-D-F scale (90%-80%-70%-60%-50% and below). 

    There is no final exam. However, most project are comprehensive in nature and students are expected to reflect upon topics brought up throughout the course. 

Readings, Course Materials and Software  
    Readings will provide background and in depth study of issues discussed in class--they are supplements, not replacements for class attendance. All readings are expected to have been completed by the date listed in course schedule and students should be ready to answer questions about the texts in class. Readings include numerous web based articles (realize that changes may be made in online readings as they are updated and, sometimes, taken off-line), a reading packet available at Abel's Copies (University Towers, 715 W. 23rd St., Suite D, 472-5353) and two short books, _In the Beginning was the Command Line_ by Neal Stephenson (Avon Books, 1999, ISBN 0-380-81593-1) and _The Victorian Internet_ by Tom Standage (Berkely Publishing Group, 1999   ISBN 0425171698), readily available at the Co-op or from one of many online or brick-n-mortar book stores.   
    Along with the assigned text books and personal web space, students should purchase media to store and move files. The lab computers are equipped with Zip drives. It is suggested that you purchase your own Zip disk (available at the Co-op or any other computer supply store). If you wish to use floppy disks instead, bring to each class AT LEAST FOUR disks (2 for work, 2 for backup) AND a disk carrying case to protect them from the trauma of your backpack or bag.   
    Specific software will be needed to complete the assignments. All necessary software is loaded on the computers in the classroom. Students using their personal computers must determine what software they find necessary and purchase it on their own. You are NOT required to purchase any particular software, but your ARE required to find access to particular software. Software we will be using includes:   
    Netscape Communicatior: including the Navigator web browser and Composer HTML editing program, available free from [Netscape](http://www.netscape.com).   
    File Transfer Protocol (FTP) and TELNET programs: available as part of the UT Connect Software Package ($10 at the Campus Computer Store) or as free- or share-ware from [Downloads.com](http://www.downloads.com). 

Class Policy  
Attendance  
Because of the hands-on seminar nature of the course, students are REQUIRED to
attend all sessions. Students who miss more than THREE sessions unexcused will
receive a failing grade no matter their grades on the assignments. If you must
miss class, you are expected to contact the instructor prior to your absence
or as soon as possible afterward. Medical or other excused absences will
require proper documentation. As per University policy, students may be
excused from class for obserbvance of religious holy days provided you give
notice of intended absence during the first week of class or 14 days prior to
the missed class.

Participation  
Class participation is an essential part of this course. Students are expected
to be ready to participate in oral discussions and online (e-mail, web forums,
etc...) activities throughout the semester. A significant portion the learning
will occur in discussion and collaboration with the instructor and other
members of the class. Do the readings and come to class prepared talk.
Students are expected to participate.

Late Assignments  
Projects, drafts and other out-of-class assignments are due at the beginning
of the class period for which they have been assigned. Late assignments of
this type will be be docked one letter grade (10%) for each day they are late.
Short out-of-class assignments and in-class projects will not be accepted
late. There will be no makeup work permitted in any case.

Honesty  
All work submitted must be your own. You may discuss assignments together, but
all that you write should be yours. If you wish to incorporate someone else's
ideas, you must acknowledge your source whether or not you quote the material
directly. When using web based materials, such as is done in this class, it is
very easy to use other's work. But, remember, it is also easy for me to find
the original source. If you have questions about the use of source materials,
see me before turning in the assignment. Plagiarism is a serious offense in
college. See the [Student Judicial Services statement on Academic
Integrity](http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/academicintegrity.html).
Serious cases of plagiarism will result in failing the course and possibly
expulsion from The University. Do not use editing services other than those
provided by the Undergraduate Writing Center or the Learning Skills Center.

Accomodation of Disabilities and Special Needs  
This course will be taught according to the University's policy on the
accomodation of disabilities. Students who need accomodations should contact
the University Extension's Senior Administrative Associate or Services for
Students with Disabilities (SSD) (471-6259/471-4641 TTY).

Complaints, Problems, etc...  
Please bring all complaints to the instructor first. I'll be happy to try to
quickly resolve any problems that may arise. If you must miss a class session
or project deadline, it is always best to contact the instructor prior to any
absence.

Open Access Policy  
Most assignments and student projects will be completed on personal web space.
Please understand that these pages will be accessible to almost anyone with
web access, both within and outside The University. Keep this public nature in
mind when you decide to place material on the web. Critique of your own and
other's work is an important part of web design, so be prepared for a public
viewing of much of what you publish on the web. However, don't be afraid of
using the web in this manner--this is not a competition and you will be graded
only on your own merits and abilities.

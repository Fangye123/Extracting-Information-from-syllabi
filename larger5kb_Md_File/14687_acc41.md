_Text Web site_ :  The text web site is a good source of various resources to
help students in their study of intermediate accounting.  It is located at
[www.wiley.com/college/acc/kieso](http://wiley.com/legacy/college/bcs/0471363049/wave_s.html)

_Answer Key_ : Copies of the problem answer key are available on reserve in
the James B. Duke Library.  


_Class Format_ :  We will begin the study of each chapter with a discussion of
the chapter, focusing on the more complex material.  Frequently, an
intermediate chapter will begin with a brief recap of material covered in your
introductory accounting course.  We will generally not spend time discussing
this material, therefore you may find your introductory accounting text useful
in reviewing and simplifying background information before reading the
intermediate material.  You will be responsible for all of the chapter
material (whether specifically discussed in class or not) unless otherwise
noted.    Accordingly, if you have questions regarding a particular topic that
is not discussed, please raise them in class.  As a part of the chapter
discussion, we will often work problems in class to further reinforce certain
concepts discussed.

_Written Assignments from the Text_ : Each reading assignment will be
accompanied by a written assignment, certain of which will be collected. Such
assignments will be collected as soon as the class discussion of the related
material is completed.  Collected assignments will not be covered in class
unless requested and are worth a total of 11 points.  The assignments are
designed to help reinforce what you have learned and identify areas where
further work is needed.  Accordingly, you do not have to get each item correct
to receive full credit.  You must, however, make a good faith effort to work
each problem in its entirety.  Assignments that do not show significant effort
will earn no points.    Late written assignments will not be accepted unless
you have an excused absence.

![](towncrier.htm)_Outside Readings and [Communication
Exercise](communication.htm)_ : Because it must meet the needs of an ever
changing business environment, Accounting is a discipline that is constantly
evolving.   To give you an understanding of this aspect of accounting and to
insure that you are aware of the most significant issues facing the profession
today,  I may occasionally assign outside readings relating to current
accounting issues which we will discuss in class.  The readings may also be a
source for exam questions.

Effective communication skills are important in this class and in the "real
world".  Accordingly, during the term I may assign short papers, cases or
other written communication exercises.  These exercises may, among other
things, require you to read an article and provide your reactions to the
material read, complete a case study or complete a group exercise.   Your
grade will be based on the substance of your comments as well as your ability
to communicate your thoughts clearly and succinctly.     A due date will be
announced at the time the assignment is given.  If an assignment is submitted
after class on the due date, it will be considered "late" by one day. Your
grade will be reduced by one full grade each day it is late.  Communication
exercises will make-up no more than 10% of your total grade.

_Professional Development_ :  In order to broaden your understanding of
accounting outside of the classroom you will be asked to complete several
professional development activities during the term.  Such activities will be
worth a maximum of 20 points.  The activities that you may choose from and
their designated point values are listed below.  Except for the bond
amortization spreadsheet, which is required, you may select any combination of
activities towards your 20 point total.  In order to encourage you to
experience a variety of activities, those designated by a * may be used only
once.  All other activities may be used a maximum of two times.  Written
reports related to these activities should be prepared in good form (among
other things, good form means the report should be typed and free of spelling
and grammatical errors).  For one of your activities (this excludes
spreadsheet preparation) you must make a brief presentation to share what you
have learned with the class.  I will randomly schedule the presentations
throughout the term.

Furman Hall). |  5

on your experience.  Include in your report a discussion of future meeting

(but are not limited to) duties, computer and communication skills needed for

discussing why you found the site to be of interest. |  3  
* In conjunction with our study of Chapter 13, use Lotus or Excel to prepare a bond amortization schedule using the effective interest method. |  3  
* Use Lotus or Excel for an accounting application other than a bond amortization schedule.  You must obtain my approval regarding the application you have selected  prior to completing this activity. |  TBD  
Other - if you have an idea for a professional development activity that is
not included above but that you believe would be meaningful, feel free to
discuss it with me. |  TBD  
  
_Exams_ :  There will be four exams during the term.  Exams will be held
outside of normal class meeting hours (generally in the evening or late
afternoon) to allow for adequate time to test the material covered.  Each exam
will be 2 to 3 hours in length.

Exams will not be reviewed in class in their entirety.  However, you may
review your test in my office outside of class and I will be happy to discuss
any questions that were not covered in class.

_Class Attendance and Participation_ : Attendance is a very important part of
this course and is expected.  Although no specific points are given for
participation, your participation  is encouraged and may marginally effect
your grade.  On occasion, the class will be divided into groups to work
particularly challenging problems.  When this occurs, please keep in mind that
your participation and contribution to the group effort is important to the
learning process of the entire group.

You will be held accountable for material discussed in class that is not in
the text.

University policy will be followed regarding the handling of excessive
absences (see the current Furman University Catalogue).

_Final Grade_ :  Your final grade will be determined based on your total
number of points earned as a percentage of the total points available.

Grading Scale A |  = | 90% - 100%  
---|---|---  
B |  = | 80% - 89%  
C |  = | 70% - 79%  
D |  = | 60% - 69%  
F |  = | Below 60%  
  
_Academic Integrity_ :  Your enrollment in this class signifies that you
accept the rules of academic honesty provided in the Helmsman. Any violation
is grounds for an "F" in this course.  Cheating on assignments, plagiarism,
and other similar conduct will result in immediate dismissal from this course.

_Students with disabilities_ who need academic accommodations should contact
Dr. Sarah Fletcher (ex. 2998) at the Office of Disability Services in Plyler
Hall 1 (basement).   After meeting with her, contact me.   It is important
that you do this early in the term.

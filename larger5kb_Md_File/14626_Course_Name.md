###  **Overview:**

This introductory course looks at the fundamental elements in women's place in
our rapidly changing world.  It explores the social, cultural, economic,
educational, religious, and political arenas and examines how women relate to
themselves, others, and the world in which they live. It is designed to start
with the cultural "givens" which have been used to define women and some of
the forces that shape these definitions.  We then see how women define
themselves.   Emphasis is placed upon helping the student to learn techniques
of critical analysis and to integrate course material into her/his daily
living experiences.

**Objectives:**

Upon successful completion of the course, students should  
1)  be able to recognize the major issues facing women today, including the
social forces that have helped to shape these issues  
2)  have an understanding of and be able to better articulate  the nature and
development of gender  
3)  appreciate the differences among women that spring from race, ethinicity,
class, and sexual identification  
4)  be able to identify and intellignetly analyse significant elements of
social change or atsis affecting women  
5) be able to use the tools of gender analysis in other contexts  
6) have improved oral and written communication skills

Students will be divided into small discussion groups which will meet as
announced and be led by a trained student facilitator.  Although your
facilitators will not be grading you, they will take attendance, and
**_attendance is required._   ** Each session attended will count 1 point
toward your final grade.  Being late to group will earn you 1/2 point only.

All students are **_required_** to get a university email account and check
the class "collabra" board. Failure to do so will affect grades.  Extra credit
opportunities and helpful study questions for exams will be posted on the
class collabra page.  This can be found at

###  **Required Books: ** All books are available at University Text, 2119
Bellflower, Long Beach, (562) 985-1326

Everyone Reads the Class Text:  
Hunter College Women's Studies Collective,  1995.  
**_Women's Realities, Women's Choices_.** 2nd edition, New York: Oxford
University Press

Everyone is required to read one of the following for the term paper:

**_The Handmaid's Tale_ , **by Margaret Atwood... frightening award-winning
story of the USA after a take-over by the Extreme Religious Right. Can it
happen here?

_**The Left Hand of Darknes** s_, by Ursela Le Guin...winner of Hugo and
Novello Awards, an adventure on a planet where natives are sexual neuters,
expect for certain times when they can become pregnant OR impregnate. This
book was a real shocker when first published.

**_Woman on the Edge of Time,_** by Marge Piercy...a Puerto Rican woman
wrongly institutionalized in a mental hospital finds a friend from the distant
future.  This is a wonderful story of power relationships and gender roles in
3 different worlds

**_The Gate to Women's Country,_** by Sherri Tepper...a biological and
sociological argument of two societies, one of women and non-violent men, and
the other of warrior men who are the lost brothers, sons, and lovers of the
women in Women's Country

**_The Mists of Avalon,_** by Marion Zimmer Bradley... a female perspective of
King Arthur's Tales, a fictionalized ancient clash between the principles of
matriarchy and patriarchy, Goddess worship

**_Thendara House,_** by Marion Zimmer Bradley...on the planet Darkover, where
women are valued for the ability to produce heirs with psychic powers, the
only alternative is the society of the Free Amazons

There is also a **_required_** packet of readings available at  Copy Pro,
corner of Atherton and Palo Verde. The reading assignments are university-
level.  As announced in the schedule of classes every semester, you are
expected to study 3 hours a week for every unit you take. **_That means that
students should expect to spend 9 hours a week studying for this class!_** In
weeks where there is a lighter reading assignment, they are urged to read the
book for the Alternate Visions term paper. Time should be scheduled carefully
to make sure you get everything done.  


###  **Assignments:**

 There will be 3 exams and a final, all of them multiple choice.  The grade on
the lowest exam will be dropped. Any missed exam will be the dropped one.
Students are expected to attend classes regularly. Lecture will not exactly
duplicate readings, so students are encouraged to **_make a friend now in
order to get notes if class is missed!_** Better still, make 2 friends; one
might take lousy notes!

Four 2-page essays of 500 words each on assigned topics are due during the
semester as indicated on the syllabus.  With the exception of the essay on the
Women's Resource Center, essays 1 week late or more will not be accepted.  All
papers mustbe turned in during class in order to be on time!!!

All students will do the Alternate Visions term paper. It pulls together
everything learned in class and demonstrates the ability to do critical
analysis.  It is very demanding because it forces one to think, but students
tell me they enjoy it.  The paper is a written analysis of one of the novels
from the attached list, using the critical techniques learned in class.  These
books are science fiction and/or fantasy genre, and present worlds where the
roles of women and men are very different from what we are used to on Earth
now. A guideline is in the xeroxed packet.  **_Follow this carefully in
order to get a passing grade!_**

Students are **_strongly encouraged to see me during office hours concerning
your paper._** I am very willing to take extra time and go over your outline
and discuss the book with you.  This is very likely to help you get a better
grade on the project.  **No untyped papers of any kind will be accepted and
any paper not turned in in the class when it is due will be considered late
and downgraded accordingly.** Late term papers will be downgraded for every
week they are late, beginning with the end of class when they are due.  In
addition, term papers turned in after the last class of the semester (although
graded) will not have detailed comments nor corrections.  


###  **Grades:**

Grading is done on a simple point system so you will always know what your
grade is, and if you need to do extra credit.  90 or more points = A, 80 = B,
70 = C, 60 = D, and anything under 60 points = F.  Opportunities for extra
credit are available, consisting of attending an event (TBA) and writing up a
2-page (500 word) summary of it.  Each event = 1 point, maximum extra credit =
5 points.  
    
   Quizzes (20 pts. each, one dropped)  |           40  
---|---  
  Alternate Visions Paper  |           20  
Group Meetings  |              9

**Withdrawals:  ** If you find you need to drop this class, it is your
responsibility to do so before week 13! University Policy permits drops after
this time ONLY in case of accident or serious illness.  Typically withdrawal
in this category involves a total withdrawal from the campus.  Request for
permission to withdraw under these circumstances must be made in writing on
the forms available from the Office of Enrollment Services.

**Cheating & Plagiarism: **For those students who have not written a term
paper before, please be aware that using someone else's ideas or words as if
they were one's own (without giving due credit) is considered plagiarism.
Cheating and plagiarism may be dealt with severely.  The faculty member may
react anywhere from assigning an "F" to referring the student for expulsion
from the university. Make sure you cite your sources!

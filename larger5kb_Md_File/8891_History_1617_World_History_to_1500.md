**Course Description:**

This course provides a survey of world history from the beginnings of
civilization to 1500 CE. The prehistoric and early literate societies of
Egypt, Mesopotamia, China and India are investigated first. A review of the
classical societies that developed in these areas and in Europe follows. The
course concludes with an examination of the medieval period in Europe and a
short investigation of the formation of civilizations in the Americas and
Oceana. Cross cultural interactions are noted throughout the course and are
especially important as the Europeans begin exploration and exploitation of
the rest of the world around 1500 CE. **

Attendance Policy:**

Attendance is the prerogative of the student, however, you are expected to be
present and participate in class discussions. You must arrange with the
instructor if exceptional circumstances require make-up tests. Instructor
office and home phones have answering machines and e-mail is checked on a
regular basis, so you can always reach me.

**Tests and Quizzes:**

There will be four objective tests in this course. Test I covers chapters 1 to
3, Test II will review chapters 4 through 6, Test III will cover chapters 7
through 10 and Test IV the remainder of the course. We will discuss the nature
of the tests the first week of class. Before each test, you will receive a
list of map locations and study terms to help you prepare for that test. Make-
up tests not arranged before the test was given can still be taken, but the
test grade will be reduced by one letter grade.

There also will be other quizzes and/or essays assigned in the course of the
semester. Some of these assignments will be in the form of short papers that
will be done at home and then discussed in class. In class quizes can not be
made up unless you have an excused absence.

The four tests will be worth sixty per cent of your final grade, the quizzes
and other assignments cover the remainder. Any evidence of cheating on a test
or quiz, or plagarism on an essay will result in a 0 grade and likely student
conduct action. (See 3.6.1 Student Code of Conduct in your _2001-2002 Student
Policy and Advising Handbook_.)

Total Points Possible = 500. A = 450; B = 400; C = 350; D = 300.

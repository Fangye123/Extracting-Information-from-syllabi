  |   |   |   | **Ken Pennington received his Ph.D. in Medieval History from
Cornell University in 1972.   In 1971 he moved from Ithaca even deeper into
the snow belt and began teaching at Syracuse.  In the Fall of 2001 he moved
his home to The Catholic University of America.  His areas of interest are
ancient, medieval, and early modern legal history, the history of
constitutional thought, political theory, church history, history of
universities, and paleography. Ken has the misfortune of coming out of a
Scandinavian gene pool but attempts to correct this biological problem by
spending as much time as possible in Italy.  He directs a school in Sicily
each October at a place called Erice where a faculty and a student body from
Europe and North America look at the history of law in a magical setting on a
mountaintop next to the Mediterranean.  During the summer [when he is sailing
on Lake Ontario or the Chesapeake](Summer1998.html), he responds very well to
being called "captain."  He is the author or editor of twelve books and over
seventy articles.  Over the past four years, he has used the www. as a tool to
teach history in the classroom and is now convinced that just as pasta should
be a part of every meal the web should be in every classroom. **

**In his research he has been particularly concerned to illustrate how the
norms created by the medieval[ _Ius commune_ ](learned.htm)shaped medieval
institutions, thought, and society. This page will provide links to his
Curriculum vitae and publications, the syllabi of his classes, the the
_History of Medieval Canon Law Project_ , the _International School of the Ius
commune_ at Erice, Sicily, and edited texts of medieval legal works. Click on

  **History of Medieval Canon Law**  
---  
![](profess3.gif) | **In 1986, Wilfried Hartmann (Universit at Tubingen) and
Ken Pennington began to organize a team of international scholars to write a
new History of Medieval Canon Law. After meetings in San Diego, Bad Homburg
(Frankfurt), Rome, the project was launched with over fifty scholars from
thirteen countries participating. The first volumes of the project are now in
press. A total of eleven volumes will be published. [Click here for
details.](djhftit.htm)**  
**As part of this project, we will publish a bio-bibliographical guide to
medieval canonical collections and jurists. The first volume is in press. The
second volume covering the period from 1140 to 1500 will be published later.
We have placed a draft version of the second volume on the Web for interested
scholars. In return, we hope that any additions or corrections to the entries
will be sent to us for inclusion.** |  **[Bio-Bibliographical Guide of
Canonists 1140-1500](biobibl.htm)**

**Medieval Legal Texts**

**The following links are to Johannes Teutonicus's Commentary on _Compilatio
tertia_. I published the first two books in 1981 (see publications) and am
preparing (slowly, I'm afraid) books three, four, and five for publication.
Until the text is ready to be printed, I shall maintain a corrected and up-
dated transcription of Johannes's Commentary based on the best manuscript,
Admont, Stiftsbibliothek 22 on the Web.**

**Baldus de Ubaldis**

**I have been working on the consilia of[Baldus de Ubaldis](BALDBIO.html) in
the Barberini manuscripts of the Vatican Library. These manuscripts were
originally in Baldus's library and offer invaluable insights into how he wrote
his consilia. The mansucripts demonstrate how Baldus revised them, sometimes
several times. I have edited three consilia from the Vatican manuscripts that
illustrate his methodology.**

placed here to aid scholars who wish to use the computer to search the texts.
These texts files did not keep their formatting commands when I put them on
the Web; consequently they must be consulted in their published form to

**Articles on line**

**Web publishing has several advantages over print: an author can update the
text and provide signposts in them that indicate what is particularly
important (good for using them in class).   The text is never "fixed".  In the
following articles I have added an index at the beginning that highlights the
points that I think are most important.  They also differ from the printed
versions of the articles in smaller and larger ways.**

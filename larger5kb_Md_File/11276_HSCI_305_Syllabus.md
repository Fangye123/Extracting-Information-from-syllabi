### Aims and Methods

     The purpose of this seminar is to acquire an understanding of the nature, development, role, and significance of technology as a dynamic element in human society.  In other words, we will be studying the social history of technology, a vast subject area, both in time, and in conceptual approaches.  To geve us a path through this area, we will use a few "texts" to provide focus, continuity, and a point of departure for looking at the subject in different ways.

     For example, at a very basic level, one can approach the history of technology either as a study in the humanities, illuminating human nature, or as one in the social sciences, yielding causal relations and predictive power.  In fact, we will want to try the social sciences viewpoint in considering technology assessment, but, at the same time, our focus on the "unexpected" consequences of technology will involve us in a study of human nature.

     In recent years historians of technology have stressed ideology, complexity, and system as important factors in the development of technology and in the characterization of its nature.  They have also broadened their concerns to provide context from the point of view of the environment, of "consumers," and of women.  These and similar factors are significant for understanding and reconstructing the technological past.  They are also important for analysing and evaluating what are taken to be the salient features of the interrelationships of technology and society.   



**Course Requirements**

Class discussion (30% of final grade)  
evaluation based on attendance, plus frequency and quality of participation.  
Paper (6-10pp) (20%)  
Term Project (30%)  
Comprehensive final examination (20%)

**Term Project**

The purpose of the term project is to study specific areas of personal
interest, and to apply newly acquired knowledge critically where appropriate,
while following a method and narrative discipline relatively unusual for an
academic exercise. Conventional history of technology is rather linear
straightforward narrative, chronological, and causally relatively simple. Such
histories oversimplify the complex interrelations of humans and technologies,
which form a rich and interwoven historical tapestry. It is extraordinarily
difficult to try to write history unconventionally, but the attempt to do so
is well worth the effort it takes to acquire a novel comparative perspective.  
To that end, we begin by viewing James Burke's videotape series CONNECTIONS.
Each of the ten one-hour episodes about technology and culture is to be viewed
(group watching, when possible, is strongly recommended); we discuss them
briefly in class, approximately one episode each week.  
For the term project, each student [or group of students] is to prepare an
additional episode. To the extent felt possible, the narrative should indicate
visual and audio context [scenes, pictures, models, music]. A shooting script
is acceptable, as would be a filmed episode or even a dramatic Power Point
presentation. Most people feel more comfortable with the conventional format
of a term paper.  
Students present their new episodes in class, beginning the week before
Thanksgiving week to ensure everyone has a chance to perform. Presentations
are limited to 15 minutes [the equivalent of about 6 double spaced typed
pages], so that a 10 minute question and discussion period may follow each
one.  
Students should clear topics and provide a rough outline (~1pp) by Thursday,
October 17, the first class after Fall Reading Period. Final written drafts or
scripts/tapes of the episodes are due by 5:00 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 6, the last
day of fall semester classes.

**Critical Paper**

George Basalla's The Evolution of Technology presents an unusual and
provocative theory of technology: an evolutionary model for understanding
technology's history and development. Students are to read Basalla's book and
write a critical evaluation of it. Papers (6-10 pp) should be handed in by
Thursday, Oct. 31.  
Because students will have already become familiar with the different
approaches and interpretive stances of Mumford, Gimpel, Cardwell, Pacey, and
White, the evaluation should ideally also be comparative.

**Texts**  
_  
_

|  Lewis Mumford | _Technics and Human Development_ (THD)  
---|---  
  |  -Volume I of the Myth and the Machine, takes us by an interpretive (some
say controversial) from prehistory to the middle ages.  
Jean Gimpel | _Medieval Machine_ (MM)  
  | -A broad and useful introduction to the revolution in medieval technology.  
DSL Cardwell | _Turning Points in Western Technology (TPWT)_  
Arnold Pacey | _The Maze of Ingenuity_  
  | -These two texts begin with medieval technology, and bring the historical
account to the twentieth century. Cardwell gives some of the internal history
that is not Mumford's purpose to recount; his book is a more conventional
historiography, yet still interpretive. Pacey's work covers similar ground,
but from a complementary viewpoint.  
James Burke | _Connections_  
  | - _Connections_ , a lively, clectic and journalistic work, has much more
detail than its parallel TV series or its successor, _Connections 2_.
_Connections_ should be read at the rate of one chapter per week. Although the
material usually will not match the current reading, either chronologically or
topically, we will briefly discuss its salient features (themes,
interpretations, historiography) each Thursday.  
George Basalla | _The Evolution of Technology (ET)_  
  | Develops an evolutionary model of technology's growth and change, from
nature-facts to artifacts. Innovation-mutation, selection pressures.  
  
  
Additional articles supplement the texts and are available as a course packet
from Mrs. Seeley, Bronfman 189, at cost.  They are, in order:  
  |

  * L. White, jr., _The Life of the Silent Majority_   (LSM)
  * L. White, jr., _Technology in the Middle Ages_   (TMA)
  * L. White, jr., _Technology Assessment from the Stance of a Medieval Historian_  (TA)
  * L. White, jr., _The Act of Invention_   (AI)
  * L. White, jr., _Historical Roots of Ecological Crisis_ (HRE)
  * L. Mumford, _The Pentagon of Power_ (POP)
  * M. R. Smith, _Technological Diterminism_ (TD) 
  * L. Marx, _Postmodern Pessimissm_ (PP)

**Class Meetings**  
Classes will be in seminar format, consisting of discussion of the salient
viewpoints, arguments, weaknesses, metaphysics, etc. presented in the assigned
reading, plus any other critical, analytical, or contextual remarks thought
relevant.

[SHOT](http://shot.press.jhu.edu/associations/shot/index1.html)  (Society for
the History of Technology) publishes a journal, Technology and Culture, that
contains many excellent articles covering a variety of topics.   One issue
each year contains a bibliographical update.

The list above may prove useful in forming ideas about how to start your
Connections episode, and what events you might like to include in it.  As you
move to refine and expand the structure and character of your episode, you
will find there are many fine and interesting books on more specific topics,
such as on industry (electrical, chemical, automotive, computer), on
engineering, on categories (power, communications, transport, military,
textiles, metallurgy, materials, domestic technologies), etc.

If you start early enough, you may be able to identify useful articles you
would like to have, which, if not held at Williams, could be ordered on inter-
library loan.  If you haven't ordered such articles before Fall Reading
Period, however, you can't count on their arriving in time for your
presentation.

Under the [Resources](../../resources.html) section of the History of Science
website are helpful materials for the history of technology, including some
useful links to sources and other reputable links.  There are many other
potentially useful Internet sites which may help you, but beware the time sink
factor.

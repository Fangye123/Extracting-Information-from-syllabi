Course Description:

Finance 375 provides students with an overview of the U.S. financial system, with an emphasis on debt markets.  After studying the flow-of-funds in the economy and the operation of U.S. capital markets, we will examine various theories of the term structure of interest rates.  We will then explore bond pricing and volatility methods in depth, and gain exposure to various fixed income derivative instruments.  Throughout the semester, students will work on a variety of problem sets and assigned readings.  In addition, students will each complete two cumulative examinations and several individually prepared financial analyses.  Throughout, students will gain exposure to financial analysis resources such as MS Excel and @Risk.

**Course Description**  
This course is a survey of California Native American Cultures. The main
temporal focus will be the late prehistoric and early historic periods. This
time period (sometimes called the  "ethnographic present") will permit us to
utilize detailed ethnohistoric and ethnographic records as well as recorded
oral histories, while at the same time permitting us to get a glimpse of
cultures before extreme change brought about by European contact. However, we
also take a brief look at the earlier prehistoric period (utilizing mostly
archaeology) as well as the effects of European and American contact from 1539
to the late 1800's. Most of the course will involve consideration of the
indigenous groups in each of California's major geographic\cultural regions:
The Deserts, Southern California, Central California, Northwestern California,
the Sierra Nevada, and Northeastern California. For each region, we will
discuss the relevant cultural groups, language families, economic practices,
social organization, material culture, and ideology. Frequently, the course
will utilize the perspective of cultural ecology: the theoretical view that
ecology significant affects cultural practices and institutions..

**Course Grading**  
Grades for the course will be based on a midterm exam (30%), a final exam
(30%), a paper (30%), and attendance and participation (10%). Look for
guidelines to the paper on the course web page. Note that there are several
deadlines for the paper during the quarter. Exams will consist of short answer
and short to medium essay questions. Students will be expected to bring a Blue
Exam Booklet for the two exams.

**Academic Honesty Policy**  
The instructor expects and requires academic honesty for both the exams and
papers. This means that each student must do all of the work and that each
exam and assignment must be the student's own intellectual, creative product.
Academic dishonesty includes plagiarism, inadequate citations, copying
answers, and other forms of cheating. It will result in the student receiving
an "F" grade and referral to the Office of Judicial Affairs.

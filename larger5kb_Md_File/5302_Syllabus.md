 **Instructional Goals:**

This course is part of the LCSC General Education requirements. These core
requirements develop skills in communication, computing, and mathematics, as
well as knowledge of how to make use of the arts, literature and natural and
social sciences in daily life. The primary goal of the Integrative Component
is for the student to develop interdisciplinary abilities in values
clarification through critical examination of exemplary problems in history
and the contemporary world.

**Within these guidelines, the instructional goals of NS350 are:**

> 1\. To expose the student to the idea that science is a way of understanding
our universe by producing responsibly supported explanations (scientific
knowledge).

>

> 2\. To provide the advanced LCSC student with the opportunity to examine the
relationship between science and society by exploring the topic of risk and
the ethical choices attached to it.

>

> 3\. To encourage the student to consider the relationships of science with
other influential human endeavors (the mass media, religion, education, and
economics), which should lead to the realization that science is a rich and
diverse product of our culture.

 **Learning Outcomes** (of the student):

1\. Demonstrate the ability evaluate scientific attempts to establish
correlative and causative relationships between variables.

2\. Demonstrate recall memory of and distinctions between several classic
moral philosophies and evaluate the student's own decision making criteria.

3\. Demonstrate the ability to assimilate web-presented information and
discuss that information in an Internet hosted forum, in a civil manner,
within a prescribed context.

4\. Demonstrate understanding of and critical thinking about science by
thoughtfully discussing, in written individual and group modes, several
controversial scientific issues. Pertinent questions include:

> 1\. What background scientific knowledge is necessary to understand the
issue?  
>  2\. What are the scientific facts that are not in dispute?  
>  3\. What are the scientific facts in dispute?  
>  4\. How does the media portray the issue?  
>  5\. How does the public respond to the issue?  
>  6\. How does the government respond to the issue?  
>  7\. What are the economic consequences of acting (or not acting) on the
issue?  
>  8\. How do our decisions about the issue reflect our moral philosophy?  
>  9\. Can a particular position receive adequate moral justification?

5\. Demonstrate ability to find relevant resources from the primary literature
on the issue, synthesize these resources into a coherent presentation on the
issue, and present these findings in a professional format.

6\. Demonstrate understanding of, and critical thinking about, how science
fits into your world by thoughtfully writing about and participating in
discussions of the relationships of science and the media, religion,
technology, government, and education. This understanding include the ability
to distinguish the process of scientific inquiry (scientific research) from
the knowledge it produces (scientific knowledge), from the people who do it
(scientists).

 **A candid discussion to help you understand NS 350 Grades:**

I design my courses with a level of difficulty appropriate to the course-level
(this is a 'junior' level college course and is designed to that level). I can
assure you that the level of work required is exactly appropriate for this
course level. Grading your performance is complex and difficult. In this
course, the optimal outcome is the ability to fully integrate concepts from
ethics with ideas from science and to think and write critically about this
interaction. Your NS350 grade will reflect both effort and achievement. I
would remind you that **by definition** a 'C' is an average grade meaning that
most of you are likely to make a 'C' in this NS350 course. Those of you that
work harder, do a better job and more clearly demonstrate the ability to think
and write critically will make a 'B'. Simply doing all the work will not
result in an 'A' or a 'B'. While I do clearly post points and let you know
your standing in class I will also honestly tell you that by design it is
difficult to attain an 'A' in my classes.   For those of you that do make an
'A' you will have earned it and you will have clearly demonstrated excellence.
To give you a better idea of what I expect I have compiled a list of
characteristics of students that have earned grades of 'A' and 'C' in this
course in the past:

> **Preparation **  
>  **A:** Always prepared for class; reading and writing assignments are  
>  done ahead of time; attention to detail allows them to occasionally correct
the professor; frequently bring interesting, unusual and or additional
material to class for discussion.  
>  **C:** Assignments prepared with minimal interest or care; not always
prepared for discussion, work frequently done at the last minute.  
>  **Attitude**  
>  **A:** Shows real interest in the class and subject; often asks interesting
questions or makes thoughtful comments.  
>  **C:** Little enthusiasm; mentally removed from class; body language
frequently screams boredom.  
>  **Results **  
>  **A:** Written work clearly displays optimal critical thinking, written  
>  work at a high college level (no mistakes and excellent content).  
>  **C:** Inconsistent or mediocre work indicates some concept of what is
going on but clearly shows student has not mastered the work. Writing reflects
a lack of critical understanding and frequently contains errors.

Failure to participate and hand in assignments **ON TIME** will result in a D
or an F in the class. If you do not meet the educational outcome requirements
for this class (see paragraph above) but do put significant effort into this
class you will make a 'D'. A grade of 'D' reflects a substandard
accomplishment either as a result of not completing all work, not meeting the
educational objectives or doing an overall 'poor' job. I will award an 'F' for
a bad faith effort on your part or if you fail to complete the course. **I
will only award an Incomplete in the most extraordinary circumstances and ONLY
if you have completed a minimum of 80% of the course points**. I will not
award an incomplete just because you get behind or because you feel you can
make a better grade by taking an incomplete.  If you do not meet these
criteria you may drop or withdraw from the class within the college time-frame
for dropping or withdrawing (I will not make exceptions here either; if you
decide to withdraw past the deadline then you are stuck with an actual letter
grade - it is YOUR responsibility to know the drop and withdraw deadlines!);
otherwise you will get an 'F' if you fail to complete the class.

 **Grading Criteria:**

|  Debate | 200 points; Human cloning  
---|---  
Human Cloning Paper | 200 points; Ethical essay written after debate.   Must
be submitted as an email attachment.  
Position Papers (4) | 240 points; #1 is 40 points, #'s 2&3 are 60 each and #4
is 80 points  
Assignments (11 total) | 210 points; First is 10 points; remaining 10 are 20
each  
Feedback (4) + Profile | 25 points; Each item counts 5 points  
_Discussions_ | _125 points; Participation in discussion group graded on a
curve_  
**Total NS350 Points:** | **1000 Points**  
  
|

|  A | >= 940 points  
---|---  
A- | 900 to 939 points  
B+ | 870 to 899 points  
B | 830 to 869 points  
B- | 800 to 829 points  
C+ | 770 to 799 points  
C | 730 to 769 points  
C- | 700 to 729 points  
D+ | 670 to 699 points  
D | 600 to 669 points  
F | <600 points  
  
|

Note that an 899 is a B and not an A. In order to make the grade you must
accumulate enough points for that grade. In the unlikely case of a borderline
grade (i.e. 899.5 etc.) I will use scientific rounding and/or your class
participation and attitude to determine your final grade.

 **Class Rules**

  1. Participation is mandatory for this class. There is overwhelming evidence that a positive correlation exists between participation and academic success.   

  2. There will be penalties for late papers. In general, late papers will be docked 5% for each day past the scheduled due date. Exceptions to this rule are rare and must be arranged with me in advance.   

  3. **Do not give a peer or a professor any kind of paper unless you have kept a copy!** I reserve the right to ask for a second copy of anything you have handed in.   

  4. All papers and exercises must be typed.  All assignments will be submitted from browser forms or as attached word-processing documents via email.  **I will not accept faxed assignments or mailed in paper assignments.**  

  5. LCSC has an Honor Policy. This class about sharing ideas. However, I consider it a violation of the college's academic honesty rules for any student to use any material from a previous NS 350 class. In addition, in all written work, you must endnotes to acknowledge the ideas of others as reflected by quotations or paraphrasing. In short, if you use some else's ideas and do not give them appropriate credit then you are stealing (Plagiarism) and will be subject to the appropriate consequences.   

**Work Load**

The Idaho State Board of Education (ISBOE) expects you to be in class 45 hours
and to work 90 hours outside class for a standard three credit college class.
For this CIP class you should spend six to nine hours per week for fifteen
weeks, **not including time spent to sort out technology problems you might
encounter**. The total time of 135 hours spent for a 3 cr. class only includes
time spent in class and studying for that class; it does not, for example,
count driving to and from class or trying to figure out how to make a computer
work. Some of you might require more than 135 hours to accomplish the outcome
performances described above, others of you will need less. My experience has
been that most of you will need about the standard amount of time so please
**budget your time** carefully!

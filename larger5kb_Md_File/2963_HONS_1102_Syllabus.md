**Methodology**

     In the colloquium on medieval civilization, we will be looking at several major cultures which developed across the world between approximately the sixth century C.E. and the sixteenth century C.E.  These cultures have, we believe, several features in common: they understood themselves to be heirs of previous cultures which they regard as in some sense as "classic" and worthy of imitation; they take the issue of the relation of society to the divine as a central focus; they are hierarchically organized at every level of society; and they are "imperial" in the sense that they understand their society's values and structures to have universal value and therefore a universal political form, in theory if not in practice.  We will study the literature and arts of the era as an "archeological" endeavor, digging deep to uncover what the texts, art, and architecture reveal about their social contexts and the author's/artist's views about God, world, human nature, knowledge, purpose, and power.
**_

Structure:_**

    This colloquium will consist of discussions led by the professors (for the most part) on the topics listed below. The readings and other assignments noted for each topic are to be done before class, as they are the basis for class discussions. Since this syllabus will be under constant revision, please check the electronic version regularly for updated assignments. Many of the assignments will require your accessing web documents through links on this syllabus.

**_

Expectations:_**

    **This is a six-credit course, which represents a time commitment of some fifteen to twenty hours per week (which includes your six hours in class). The course will have a mid-term examination and a comprehensive final examination, the dates of which are listed on this syllabus. You will be expected to attend and report on at least one academic or cultural event on campus this semester. There will be an ongoing research project, which will cumulatively count for 25% of your grade.   The details of this assignment are available on the link below.  The two exams will constitute half of your grade for the course; the other quarter of your grade will be based on the other work in the course, and on your attendance at and participation in the class.**

> **Since this course is very much a cooperative enterprise, involving
discussion of a wide variety of materials, you are expected to be present at
all meetings of the class, on time and prepared to participate in the day's
discussion.  Lateness to class and late return from the break are rudeness to
the rest of the class.  As a courtesy to your classmates, you are expected to
turn off your pagers or cell phones so as not to interfere with the class
discussions.  **

>

> **The course syllabus is a dynamic document, reflecting the development of
the course over the semester; you should check it before every class.   You
will also be expected to attend at least two cultural events on campus and
hand in one-page reviews of the events.  **

Theocentricity, Hierarchy, Empire. **

 **  
How do 'we' understand/acquire/read/build the meaning of texts, objects,
events, space, eras? OR "Can't anything be simple anymore?" Discuss
expectations, research paper requirement, information technology.**

**One of the innovative aspects of "medieval" culture was the development of
religion as the understanding of sacred texts; we will discuss the origins of
this mindset in second-century BCE Judaism as well as in nascent
Christianity.**

****The allegorical mind was characteristic of medieval civilization; we will
be discussing the multivalency of the medieval mind.**   Read the texts from
Maimonides and Origen on John to see their sense of the multiple layers of
meaning to be found in the texts they are commenting on. **

Murzaku  
Sweeney  
Webb ** |  | **Development of early Christianity **

**One of the principal characteristics of medieval society was the centrality
of the issue of God to all aspects of society.   In Europe, that issue was the
result of the conversion of Europeans to Christianity, or, perhaps more
precisely, the Christianization of these peoples.  The cross of Justin II, at
right, was made in Constantinople in the early 6th century and presented by
the Emperor Justin II to the pope in 560.  The form of the cross, made of gold
and encrusted with precious gems, demonstrates the imaginative fusion of
wealth, political power and religious hope so characteristic of medieval
society. ** | **![wpe1.jpg \(6586 bytes\)](1102.h1.jpg)**

**Controversy, consensus, creed, and cultural confluence. Continue work on
uses and understandings of scripture, including allegory.  **

**Questions for reading:   Can we see a development of understandings of the
meaning of Jesus in the early middle ages? How do creeds arise? How is
orthodoxy and heterodoxy derived?  **Be prepared to discuss why the Gospel of
Thomas was not admitted into the Christian canon.   In what ways are the
creeds of the Council of Nicaea and of St. Athanasius different from the
Gospels?   How does Augustine reconcile the Christian church with imperial
Roman civilization?  ****

Murzaku  Webb** | **Christianization of the Empire and of the barbarian
tribes.**

**Questions for reading:  
How did the process of "Christianization" of Europe take place?  
What syntheses of cultures (Greco-Roman and Germanic), religion, literatures
and imagination coincide in the development of western Christianity and in its
portrayals of Jesus?  
How did the bishops of Rome establish their authority beyond their own city?  
How was the Christianization of the barbarian peoples connected with the
development of the Christian church as an institution? **

**Find the correspondences between the societies shown in Tacitus' _Germania_
, _Beowulf, The Wanderer_ , and the _Dream of the Rood_.   How does the
crucifixion account in the latter differ from the gospels' versions?  How does
the _Rood_ use dream imagery and paradox?   Can Beowulf be allegorized as
Christ?**

**Research assignment:   click [ here ](figures.html) for the details of your

the Christian church as an institution: in the West as a substitute for the

of the Germanic tribes led to the development of a new form of literature, in
which we can see the tensions between the ancient beliefs of these tribes and
the Christianity which they adopted.**

**Sweeney  
Webb ** | **Scholasticism and the Universities**

**Why is the movement in Western Europe known as scholasticism so named? How
would you describe the social, philosophical, religious dimensions of this
movement? What were the repercussions of and reactions to this way of thought?
In your preparation for this class, pay particular attention to Anselm's
argument as he attempts to give a rational demonstration of his belief that
God exists, and then to the nature of Thomas' handling of the same question.**

**Note the way in which Anselm's style is very close to that of Augustine in
the _Confessions_ , while Thomas takes a stylistically very different approach
to the same question.  Note also that Thomas is disagreeing with Anselm's
conclusions, and coming up with a different _kind_ of answer to the question.
**

**What kind of conclusions can you draw about the change in the way people
thought, from looking at these two different kinds of argument?   Do you agree
with Anselm?  with Thomas?  Why?**

**You may be amused by some of the documents on life in the early medieval
universities.   Things aren't as different as you may think!**

**Research assignment: hand in a three- to five- page paper discussing the
cultural world in which your character lived and worked.   Depending on
circumstances, this may entail such matters as religion, philosophy, politics,
art, music, social history, and any other issues necessary to place that
individual in his/her proper context.  You must include appropriate
documentation of the print and web sources of your information.**

[](http://www.knight.org/advent/summa/summa.htm)******The bus will leave from
the Art Center (the red barn) at the Main Gate of campus at 8:15 a.m. Be there
on time, so we can get to the Cloisters promptly.  We will return in time for
you to get to a 1 p.m. class.   This trip is in class time; your participation
is not optional.****

****In preparation for this trip, review the materials for the February 26
class.   Think particularly about the philosophical implications of the shift
from the romanesque to the gothic, and be prepared to look for the growing
emphasis on the individual and particular that is characteristic of the
gothic.  You will be required to hand in a one-page description and analysis
of one object from the Cloisters collection; this assignment will be due on
March 7.****

will trigger discussion of the central issues these items illustrate.   The
questions developed for the exam appear below.****  
**3/12** | **Theocentricism and Hierarchy: Cosmic, societal, literary**

**How does Dante's Inferno capture essential characteristics of the medieval
view of the cosmos, the use and meaning of religious symbolism and the concept
of societal/religious justice? Themes: hell, sin, redemption, the medieval
cosmos, the view of the "other" , the allegorical mindset, eros as a danger;
the mystic  journey **

**Imagine that you will be discussing the Inferno as one of the items you will
use for the second questions of your midterm exam, and prepare discussion
points for that answer.**

**Course description**  
Critical thinking about the diverse influences shaping the life sciences.
Topics include evolution and natural selection; heredity, development and
genetic determinism; biotechnology and reproductive interventions. We
interpret episodes in science, past and present, in light of scientists'
historical location, economic and political interests, use of language, and
ideas about causality and responsibility. You address the course material on a
number of levels: as an opportunity to learn the science and interpretive
approaches; as models for your own teaching; and as a basis for discussions
about practices and philosophies of education, construed broadly as a project
of stimulating greater citizen involvement in scientific debates.

**Assessment and Requirements**  
Your grade will be based on the components below, which are described in more
detail in the course packet and weekly handouts. For each of the two parts of
the grade, completion of "basic work" (= 80% of assignments) gives you an
automatic B+. To have a chance--but not a guarantee--of getting a higher
grade, "additional work" is taken into account (see course packet for details
and rationale).  
  
Written assignments and presentations, 2/3  
A. Project: This should concern critical thinking about the influences shaping
some aspect of the life sciences, past or current. A sequence of 5 assignments
(initial description, annotated bibliography, narrative outline, class
presentation, complete draft, and 2000-3000 word final report) is required.  
B. Journal excerpts (see E. below) (submitted 5 times during weeks 2-12 = 5
assignments).  
C. Clippings packet: A compilation of items from current magazines,
newspapers, and websites (= 1 assignment).  
Participation and contribution to the class process, 1/3.  
D. Prepared participation and attendance at class meetings.  
E. Journal with weekly responses/notes on readings, class discussions,
clippings, websites, and study questions. Collected for perusal mid-semester
& end.  
F. Minimum of two in-office or phone conferences on your project and other
written work.  
G. Optional* End-of-semester Portfolio demonstrating the development of your
work (*for "additional work" grade only).

**Texts and Materials**  
Course reader (xerox packet) in installments from PT. Get a three ring binder
to hold the packet and other xeroxed handouts.  
On reserve in Healey library:  
Folders of additional readings  
Binder of newspaper clippings  
Binder of previous students' assignments  
Additional information about classes, assignments, and other tasks will be
provided in regular handouts (which will also be posted on the course
website).  
You need a workbook/journal to carry with you at all times and an organized
system to store loose research materials (e.g., a 3 ring workbinder with
dividers and pockets, an accordion file, or file folders).  
Additional cases and lesson plans (part of a text in development) will be
linked to the course website.

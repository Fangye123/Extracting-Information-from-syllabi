>> ** **

>

> **This course is designed to give you an opportunity to gain valuable
experience in the areas of instructional design and multimedia authoring. The
course covers both theory and practice of (a) hypertext and multimedia, and
(b) instructional design.**

>

> **Computers are refiguring ideas of text, writing, reading, and the
instructional process. These changes can be felt at all levels of society,
from the way the entertainment industry is growing, to new arenas of business,
to the way education is conceived.**

>

> **Reading is no longer about sitting down with an object known as a book and
paging through the content. Writing is no longer about letters that form words
being printed on a paper page. Computer technology allows us to add graphics,
color, video, and sound to our words, increasing the ways we might communicate
a message to an audience. At times, the best way to communicate is to
concentrate on one or a selected few of these sign systems; at other times the
most effective communications incorporate all of these media. This course will
give you the chance to examine the theories behind some of the technological
changes that are affecting the seemingly "low-tech" activities of reading and
writing. We will look at rhetorical theory generally and how hypertext makes
us rethink historical ideas about communication. We will also examine the
strengths and weaknesses of different media as communication tools. More is
not always better in the world of multimedia, and we will look at why this is
the case. By the end of the semester you will have an understanding of which
technologies facilitate particular kinds of communication and how you might go
about making such decisions for the new media that emerges throughout your
lifetime.**

>

> **In addition to the theoretical and analytical work in this class, you will
have the chance to examine, in depth, the way technology is affecting
education by working with a faculty member to develop multimedia course
materials. During the internship portion of the course, you will learn to
apply principles of instructional design, as well as how to analyze currently
available technology in order to make the best choices in an educational
environment. You will be working on teams throughout the semester, but the
course also includes a variety of opportunities for class members to
communicate about their projects as the semester proceeds.**

> **At the beginning of the semester you will be assigned to a team. In
addition to working consistently on the project to which you are assigned
(approx. 10-12 hours a week), you will also be expected to complete the
following assignments:**

>

> ** **

>

> **1\. Read the articles listed on the syllabus and attend the four Thursday
sessions.**

>

> **2\. Collaborate with class members. This should include regular
contributions (at least once a week) to a course listserv. This electronic
discussion list will serve as a forum for you to share ideas, questions, and
problems with one another. This listserv is also a place for you to discuss
the articles that are assigned during the part of the semester when we have no
official class meetings. The articles in Sociomedia will be assigned
throughout the semester as the basis for online discussions. A schedule for
the readings will be announced at the second class meeting. Think of the
listserv as our virtual classroom.**

>

> **Collaboration also includes contact with your assignment partner, and
possible MOO work.**

>

> **3\. Write a needs analysis for your project.**

>

> **4\. Complete a team/project visitation.**

>

> **5\. Present your project to the class. During the last week of the
semester (time/date to be announced) we will schedule the groups to present
the work they have accomplished during the semester. Each student will be
expected to present and attend the other presentations.**

>

> **6\. Reflective progress journal. This journal will be a place to document
your work through the project. It is also a place where you can come back to
the ideas presented in the first few weeks and examine how they relate to your
project. We will look to your work here as a chronicle of the semester, and we
will expect some version of the problems faced during the project and how you
managed to resolve them. Also, the journal should illustrate an understanding
of the theoretical issues as they relate to the work you performed during the
semester. The journal will be graded on a pass/fail basis.**

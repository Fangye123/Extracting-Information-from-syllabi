**II. COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  


History 352 is a **SURVEY** of the thousands of years of history of the Middle
East and North Africa. This is clearly a formidable undertaking. This task is
even more daunting when you realize that at various times peoples from this
region have expanded into the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), a large
area of southeastern Europe (e.g. the country formally known as Yugoslavia),
and parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, I am setting certain
chronological, geographical and thematic restrictions on what we are to cover.
Some of these restrictions are as follows:

    1. The Middle East extends eastward by most reckonings as far as Afghanistan. We will, however, not emphasize Persia (Iran), Afghanistan, and the Islamic states which were a part of the former Soviet Union.
    2. We will begin our study with the 6 th century AD/CE, the century in which the Prophet Mohammed was born.

**IV. BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES (and COMPETENCIES):**

continuity overtime, organize historical evidence, and ask and answer critical

critical interpretation and understanding of the past.  In addition, a student

have regarded as aesthetically pleasing and the ways in which they were
produced.

**V. EVALUATION CRITERIA/GRADING SCALE:**  


1\. Grades will be based on three examinations, writing assignments, and class
participation. Each exam will be based on the units of study immediately
preceding it and will be written in a **blue book** which may be purchased in
the book store. The class may determine the size of the blue book to be used.

    
  Exams will each count 3 x 20% | 60%  
---|---  
Individual Assignments | 30%  
Class Participation | 10%  
TOTAL | 100%  
    


**NOTE:** YOU SHOULD NEVER MISS A SCHEDULED EXAM. UNLESS THE ABSENCE IS
EXCUSED WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION, THE MAKE-UP EXAM GRADE WILL BE REDUCED BY
ONE LETTER GRADE AS A PENALTY FOR ABSENCE. MAKE-UP EXAMS ARE AT THE SOLE
DISCRETION OF THE INSTRUCTOR.

**SPECIAL NOTE ON ACADEMIC HONESTY:** Students should be aware that a
university is a community of scholars committed to the discovery and
dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without the freedom to investigate all
materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting findings, and proper acknowledgment
of credit, such a community can not survive. Students are expected to adhere
to the highest traditions of scholarship. Any infractions of these traditions,
such as plagiarism, are not tolerated. Though we do not anticipate any such
occurrence, for the record, misrepresenting someone else's words or ideas as
one's own, constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism occurs, the
instructor has the right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks
appropriate. One guide line holds that the first offence = failure of the
assignment; the second offence = failure of the course.

  Grades and their numerical equivalents are as follows:

_Numerical Limits_ |  _Letter Grades_  
---|---  
92 and above |  A  
               83-91  |  B  
               73 -82  |  C  
               64-72  |  D   
               63 and below  |  F  
    


2\. INSTRUCTOR POLICIES  
  a. **MAKE-UP WORK**

      1. **EXAMS:** Unless the absence is excused with proper documentation, the make-up exam grade with be reduced by one letter grade as a penalty for absence. Make-up exams are at the sole discretion of the instructor **.** Missed exams caused by an excused absence must be made up **WITHIN ONE WEEK** unless illness or emergency necessitates a longer absence from school.
      2. Missed due date of the assignment. This applies to writing assignments- **-SUBTRACT ONE LETTER GRADE.**
      3. No make-up work will be accepted the last week of classes.
b. **EXTRA CREDIT** may be earned through cultural reaction papers turned in
with the exam.      **[GUIDE](cultreacpap.htm)**

c. As a rule, I do not give an incomplete. If you choose not to complete the
class please formally withdraw from it.

**VI. COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

**Assignments:** Assignments for this class will include reading, writing, and
special projects to include:

    1. Short Paper/Oral component--Debate format--topics to be furnished separately
    2. Current Events Notebook
    3. Country Profile--Worldwide Islam

**Attendance and Punctuality:** **Students are responsible** for material
covered and assignments.

**Class Participation:** All students are expected to come to class prepared
to discuss the assigned material, so it is important to complete all the
assigned readings **_before_** coming to class. Any student may, at any time,
be called upon to recite or to write a short essay on the assigned material.
Short quizzes may be given on assigned materials at any time. Students are
expected to **_understand_** the material, or at least have identified those
items that they do not yet understand in order to ask question in class. The
instructor will assume that students know the material and are prepared to
discuss it. Students are responsible for all work assigned in this class,
whether or not they are present. Assignments must be completed on time.

Students are expected to observe normal courtesy in class. They are expected
to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to refrain from
personal conversations, and to avoid any other behavior which is disruptive
and disturbing to others. A student who does not observe these courtesies may
be asked to leave the room.

This course is designed to help improve your proficiency in note-taking,
library skills, logical and analytical thinking and writing, and critical
evaluation.

**VII. TEACHING STRATEGIES**  


The mode of presentation for the course will be lecture/student discussion.
There will be opportunities for cooperative learning. I encourage peer
teaching and recommend students to work together through study groups. I want
to emphasize the critical analysis of data--information you read and see on
film/video and the communication of your ideas supported by facts. While these
skills are important to the course work at hand, they are most important in
your life's work where you read, listen, evaluate, articulate, communicate
your understanding, ideas, and opinions on a daily basis. These activities
will give you practice in these areas.

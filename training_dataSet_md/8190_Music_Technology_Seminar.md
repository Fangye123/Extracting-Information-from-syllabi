**A First Assignment: Text Formatting** **           **(top)

  * Begin with a text document on a musical topic. A term paper from a previous music course would be suitable. Edit the document using MS Word.
  * Plan to enhance this document in several steps. Try to visualize an ideal design, which might include hyperlinks, use of graphic images, and audio.
  * Convert the text document to an HTML document.
  * Experiment with some interesting formatting features: font styles, indents, tables, etc.

* * *

**Assignment 2: A Media-Enchanced Web Page on a Musical Topic.** **
**(top)

Projects will be submitted for a grade. Employ all the following elements: An
HTML document on a musical topic with text, table, graphics, sound, and
navigation links. Strive for interesting content, elegant design and practical
functionality.

  * Format: HTML generated with _Dreamweaver_ or other means.
  * Table: any functional application of a simple table
  * Graphics: Photoshop optimized for web, embedded in HTML document   
\- music notation screen shot  
\- Scan  
\- Original art work (graphic diagram, etc.)

  * Sound   
\- Use SoundEdit 16 to convert from audio CD to AIFF and trim excerpt  
\- Use MediaCleaner to convert from AIFF to MP3  
\- Use sample HTML from [Chopin example](ChopinMP3/goToMP3.html) provided
(Thanks fot the help, Cyrill!).

  * Links: internal and external  

An excerpt from a larger work in progress is acceptable, but all work

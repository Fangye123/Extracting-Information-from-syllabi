**Introduction** : Theory and Practice of Science (TPS), versions of which
have been offered at Columbia College since 1981, is designed as a substantive
alternative to the traditional "science for non-scientists" undergraduate
course. The premise behind the TPS approach is that, by introducing some
elementary mathematical intuitions and techniques, original scientific papers
(rather than textbooks) can be used as the basis for studying what science is
about, what scientists actually do, and how the theory and practice of science
evolve. In this course we'll introduce some principles and techniques from
discrete mathematics, probability, and statistics, and then examine a
development in the history of biology, the discovery of the structure of DNA,
reading original works by Mendel, Morgan, Sturtevant, Avery, and Watson &
Crick (among others). Our time in class will be spent in a combination of
lectures and discussions about the experiments, theories and practices of
science during this period, and their consequences for our thinking and
judgments about more contemporary scientific activities (e.g. the Human Genome
Project).

**Details** : This is a nine-week course that meets on Wednesdays and
Thursdays, from May 29th through July 25th, from 1-3:30 p.m., with recitation
sessions on Wednesdays from 3:30-5 p.m. There will be no class on July 4th,
the make-up class for that date scheduled for Friday, June 7th.

**Requirements** : Students are required to attend class, read the assigned
books and papers carefully, and to complete several homework sets throughout
the term. There will be a 3-hour final exam in which students will have to
analyze a contemporary scientific article they have never before seen.

**Readings** : Most of the science papers we'll read are available on the Web,
or will be made available in class, and copies of all of the papers will be on
reserve in Butler Library. The following texts are also required (and can be
purchased at Labyrinth Books):

  * Schrodinger, Erwin. _What is Life?_ (Cambridge University Press, 1992 [1944]). 
  * McCarty, MacLyn. _The Transforming Principle_ (W. W. Norton, 1986). 
  * Watson., James. _The Double Helix_ (New American Library, 1991 [1968]) 

The following texts are recommended but will not be assigned:

  * Dennis, Carina et al. The Human Genome (Palgrave, 2002). 
  * Judson, Horace Freeland. The Eighth Day of Creation, Expanded Edition (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1996). 
  * Kevles, Daniel and Leroy Hood. The Code of Codes : Scientific and Social Issues in the Human Genome Project (Harvard UP, 1993). 
  * Paul, Diane. The Politics of Heredity : Essays on Eugenics, Biomedicine, and the Nature-Nurture Debate (SUNY Press, 1998). 

Xeroxed excerpts from _The Scientific Experience_ , v. 2, by Goldstein, Gross,
Pollack and Blumberg will also be assigned.

**Options and Contacts** : I will teach an optional recitation section (which
will serve as my office hours too) on Wednesdays, beginning on June 5th. I can
also be reached by e-mail at: rbb@brown.edu. I can arrange additional office
hours if necessary.

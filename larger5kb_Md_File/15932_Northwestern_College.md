Think of the past as space expanding infinitely beyond our vision. . . . Then
we choose a prospect. The higher it is, the wider and hazier our view. Now we
map what we see, marking some features, ignoring others, altering an unknown
territory . . . into a finite collection of landmarks made meaningful through
their connections. History is not the past, but a map of the past, drawn from
a particular point of view to be useful to the modern traveler.

Henry Glassie, _Passing the Time in Ballymenone: Culture and History of an
Ulster Community_ (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1982), 621.

It is no easy matter to tell the truth, pure and simple, about past events;
for historical truths are never pure, and rarely simple.

David Hackett Fischer, _Historians' Fallacies: Toward a Logic of Historical
Thought_ (New York: Harper Colophon, 1970), 40.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

**_What is this course?_** The course is  "a study of problems relevant to
history as a scientific and humanistic discipline" (NW Catalog). It can be
counted either for history or philosophy credit (but not both). Themes
considered will include the history of history (a.k.a. historiography),
analytical philosophy in relation to historical knowledge, objectivity,
causation, argument, and narration, the historian's self, the historian and
advocacy, and the relation of a Christian worldview to such issues.

**_What will class meetings be like?_** The course will meet once a week. It
will be taught more on the model of a seminar, which means, for one thing,
that the student should not expect a lecture course. There will be some
lectures, but other major components of the course's format will be general
discussions and student oral reports. The seminar model is based on the
instructors being guides for the student's learning through reading,
discussion, research, and writing.

**_What will be expected in general of each student?_** The workload of the
course reflects its upper division level and its seminar mode. _Attendance_ at
all class meetings is, of course, expected. Some 3000 pp. of _reading_ will be
required, including reading in relation to research. Regular _discussion_ of
assigned reading is expected. A research paper with oral report, two take-home
essay exams, an oral presentation of a written reading analysis, and a reading
journal will provide ample opportunity for _critical_ _writing, oral
presentation,_ and some _research._

**COURSE OBJECTIVES (WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS COURSE SHOULD MAKE):**

  1. Acquire an overview of the history of history (historiography) in the western tradition, since historians, of all people, should have some sense of the history of their own discipline. "[God] has made everything suitable for its time; moreover he has put a sense of past and future into their minds . . ." (Eccl. 3:11).
  2. Become a more critical historian through reflecting on various challenges and ambiguities entailed in historical study and knowledge. "I too decided, after investigating everything carefully from the very first, to write an orderly account for you, . . . so that you may know the truth concerning the things about which you have been instructed" (Luke 1:3-4).
  3. Become a humbler historian through reflecting on the paradoxical role of the historian. "For now we see in a mirror, dimly . . ." (1 Cor. 13:12).
  4. Become a historian more firmly grafted into Christ through learning to connect historical understanding and practice with a Christian worldview. "Those who abide in me and I in them bear much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing" (John 15:5).

  2. _TASK:_ The paper is to explore the chosen topic in light of a) the particular issue or historian, b) relevant primary and/or secondary material, and c) relevant course material. _NOTE: To keep the historiographic focus in mind, remember that the primary documents are those of historians, and that the task is to focus on what historians do, and why._
  3. _PRIOR TO COMPLETING THE PAPER:_

>   1. _In class on Oct. 9,_ each student will hand in a) a paragraph
description of their proposed topic and focus and b) a working bibliography of
at least 3 items. The _proposal and bibliography_ may be handwritten or typed.

>   2. _In class on Dec. 11_ each student will make an _oral report_ of their
research. Each report should

>

> >   * be 10-15 minutes long;

>>   * cover the following (not necessarily in this order): a) what is your
topic, b) what led you/interests you about the topic, c) what are the major
elements you cover in the paper, d) what thesis and/or claim(s) do you make
about your topic in relation to course material and/or issues, and e) anything
else relevant that you wish to raise.

>>   * be followed by _general discussion_.

>>

  4. _SPECIFICATIONS:_ two (2) copies, typed, title page, double-spaced, 12-16 pp. of text + notes (end- or foot-) The notes should adhere to the Chicago/Turabian form as discussed in the appropriate links in [Course Links](phlinks.htm).
  5. _DUE:_ in class, Dec. 11.
  6. _EVALUATION:_ The most important factors in evaluating the paper include a) how well does the student meet all the stipulations above? b) how thoroughly (in light of the reading and issues of the course as well as of the topic) has the paper been thought through and researched? c) how insightful (in light of the reading and issues of the course as well as of the topic) is the analysis? and d) how lucid and cogent is the presentation?

**_B. TWO TAKE-HOME ESSAYS will constitute 30% of the course grade_**

  1. _ESSAY #1 will constitute 15% of the course grade:_ A mid-course essay question asking for analysis, synthesis, and integration of course readings and discussions will be distributed in class Oct. 2; it is due two week laters, Oct. 16, in class.
  2. _ESSAY #2 will constitute 15% of the course grade:_ A final essay question asking for analysis, synthesis, and integration of course readings and discussions will be distributed in class Dec. 11; it is due a week later, Dec. 18, by the scheduled final period.
  3. _FURTHER SPECIFICATIONS:_ typed, double-spaced, 4-5 pp., references to be done at the end of sentences and/or paragraphs in shortened form, e.g., (Mink article, p. 207).
  4. _EVALUATION:_ The most important factors in evaluating the essay include a) how well does the essay address the entire question that is asked? b) how accurately, thoughtfully, and thoroughly are course materials used in support of the answer? c) how insightful is the analysis? and d) how lucid and cogent is the presentation?

**_C. An APV (Another Point of View) will constitute 15% of the course
grade_**

  1. _TASK:_ Each student will have an assigned article or chapter that they will read and a) on which they will write synopsis and critical analysis, 2-3 pp. typed and double-spaced, making copies for all class members as well as instructors, and which, after distributing the copies of the written APV to the class, b) they will orally present to the class.
  2. _DUE:_ per signup list circulated in class.
  3. _FURTHER SPECIFICATIONS:_ begin the written APV with the author, title, source, and date of the article or chapter as a title header. The student's name and the date of the presentation should be in the upper right or left hand of the first page.
  4. _EVALUATION:_ The most important factors in evaluating the APV include a) how clear of a synopsis of the article/chapter is provided (the rest of the class will not have read the item, so this synopsis will be their primary basis of knowledge about the assigned piece)? b) how thoughtfully is the reading related to issues of other reading for the evening and, more generally, for the course? c) how lucid and cogent is the presentation, oral as well as written?

**_D. CLASS PARTICIPATION will constitute 15% of the course grade_**

  1. _READING JOURNAL_

  * _For each class for which there is assigned reading_ each student should hand to one of the instructors at the beginning of class a written journal entry relating to some aspect of that class's reading.
  * A journal entry should consist of one or more paragraph (150-250 words), handwritten or typed, that responds to or reflects on some aspect of the reading.
  * Since the instructors will keep these journal entries, they should have the student's name and the day's date on them, and the student should have a copy of the written item for their own use if they desire to refer to it in discussion or before the instructors return it to them.
  * The journal entries will be graded with either a "+" (90-100%), a ">" (80-89%), a "<" (70-79%), or a "-" (below 70%), depending on a) how well the journal entry convinces the instructors that attentive reading of assignments has been done and b) how thoughtfully the entry raises a question, poses a problem, connects disparate material, clarifies an issue, or otherwise shows intellectual engagement with the reading in relation to issues of the course.

  2. _CLASS PARTICIPATION_ as a portion of the grade combines the overall evaluation of the reading journals by the instructors with an overall assessment of student participation in classes.
  3. _STUDENT PARTICIPATION IN CLASSES_ assumes that you have done the assigned reading; the instructors will look for evidence of this beyond the reading journals. Participation also includes classroom etiquette as well as engagement, e.g., contributing to the general thrust of the discussion, suggesting an alternative perspective or another important consideration, offering constructive criticism of one's own or another's ideas, deferring to other students who participate less, evidencing a grasp of the material in the assigned reading, and so on.

|  **Course Introduction**  
---  
In this class, students examine the era of history known as "The Gilded Age."
This was a time of unparalleled economic expansion that profoundly altered
political and social arrangements by the late nineteenth century. After the
Civil War (1861-65) America completed a transportation and communications
network, which in turn facilitated the tremendous growth of the industrial
sector. Thus, identifying and understanding the causes of "industrialization,"
are a major focus of the reading and lectures in 147B. Additionally, the
consequences are explored as well. Students will be required to analyze the
impact of economic change on politics, society, and cultural practices, with
special attention to the rise of protest movements against the emerging
industrial capitalist system.

---  
Ballard C. Campbell, ed., _The Human Tradition in the Gilded Age_  
Robert C. McMath, Jr., _American Populism: A Social History, 1877-1898_

Questions on the _The Gilded Age_ and _The War with Spain_ will be on the
final exam. My suggestion is that you read the former by week 5. The latter
has specific page assignments (you don't have to read the whole book) in week
10.

There will be weekly reading assignments from the website. The vast majority
of website assignments are very small, so please do not be alarmed by this
part of the readings. There are also weekly
["handouts"](../private/handouts/handouts.html), which are small study guides
for the lectures.

**I. course description:**  
  
     Natural History of Vertebrates is a course designed for biology majors. The objective of the course is to provide an in-depth study of the vertebrates. Topics will include the origin and evolution of vertebrates, and their ecology, behavior and specializations. The lecture will also introduce the theories concerning the evolution of the vertebrates and the evidence that supports those theories.  
    Even though the lecture course (ZO 556) is a separate course from lab (ZO 557), both courses support each other. You can not take one course without the other, that is you must be concurrently enrolled in both courses. To this end you must pass the lecture to get a passing grade in lab, and you must pass the lab to get a passing grade in lecture. IF YOU FAIL EITHER COURSE, YOU MUST REPEAT BOTH COURSES.  
  
**II. pre-requisites:**  
  
     You must have completed biology of animals and lab (ZO 214/215) or its equivalent. That course will give you a basic understanding of animals and their evolution and organization. Natural History of Vertebrates will then build on this information.  
  
**III. course organization:**  
  
     Material will be presented primarily in the form of lectures and reading assignments from the text. Lecture will cover the points to be learned and will direct your study from the text. You can not expect to pass Natural History of Vertebrates without intensive study outside of lecture (2 hours of study for every hour in class). The material presented in the latter part of the course will be based on material presented in the first part of the course, therefore you will have to commit the material to long term memory. In addition, the final exam is comprehensive.  
  
    I have placed notes from the lecture on a web site. I am assuming that you will read these notes each day before coming to class. In addition, there will be material for which your are responsible that may only be presented in these notes on the web site. Do not ignore these notes; they are not optional material.  
  
**IV. grading:**  
  
     Your grade will be determined based upon the total points earned on examinations, a term paper, and some small homework assignments. There is no provision for doing extra or outside work to improve your grade.  
  
    A  = 92.0% to 100%     A-  = 89.0% to 91.9%     B+  = 86.0% to 88.9%     B  = 83.0% to 85.9%     B-  = 79.0% to 82.9%     C+  = 76.0% to 78.9%     C  = 70.0% to 75.9%     D  = 60.0% to 69.9%     F < 60.0%  
  
**examinations:** Three tests plus a final exam are scheduled for the semester
(see class schedule). The final exam is comprehensive. Each test is worth 100
points. The final exam is worth 200 points, 100 points over material since the
last test and 100 points over material from the entire semester. This yields
500 possible points on the exams. If you have to miss an exam for whatever
reason, I would appreciate it if you would make arrangements before hand to
take the exam. If you have several other tests scheduled for the day of an
exam or some other catastrophe befalls you, you may postpone the test a day or
two. IF, BEFORE YOU TAKE THE EXAM, YOU DISCUSS THE EXAM WITH ANY CLASSMATE(S)
FOR ANY REASON, EVEN TO ASK HOW LONG THE TEST IS, YOU AND THE CLASSMATE(S)
WITH WHOM YOU TALKED WILL RECEIVE AN AUTOMATIC "F"; NO QUESTIONS ASKED!!! The
make up exam may not be the same test as that taken by the rest of the class.  
  
**term paper:** The paper is worth 20% of your grade (125 points). The term
paper must be a review article about some aspect (for example; evolution,
behavior, foraging ecology, reproduction, energetics) of a taxon of
vertebrates (order, family, genus, or species). This article should be an in-
depth summary and discussion about your topic. This assignment is in two
parts.      First, a literature search plus a 2-page summary of two of the
articles from the [primary literature](revpaper.htm#primary) is due at the
beginning of class on 27 February 2002 (late penalty points apply, see below).
You must include the print-out from the [online computer search for
citations](http://www.emporia.edu/libsv/ressubj.htm) in the Basic Biosis
database in FirstSearch, your summary of the two articles, plus a copy of the
two articles. This summary must be at least 2.0 full pages, but not more than
3.0. The summary must be typed exactly in the style of the term paper that is
due later in the semester and statements that you make in the summary must be
supported with appropriate citations that are then listed in the "literature
cited" section at the end of the paper. The two articles must address the same
topic and your summary must indicate the relationships between the two papers.
For example, one paper builds on the work of a previous paper, or the two
papers present opposite views of the same topic, or the two papers reach the
same conclusions but use different methods. The summary should include why the
authors performed the research, how they did the research, what they found,
and a discussion of the results. Also include a paragraph discussing why you
chose your particular topic. This summary is worth 25 points. The summary will
be graded upon your ability to summarize the findings and its grammatical
correctness. Be sure to read the ["Instructions for Review Papers in Natural
History of Vertebrates"](revpaper.htm) and pay particular attention to the
sections on citing literature and plagiarism.  
    The second part is the paper itself, which is worth 100 points. There is no upper limit to the number of citations that would be appropriate. You should use as many as is possible concerning your topic, however, minimally the literature cited section must contain at least 12 citations, with at least 9 of these from the [primary scientific literature](revpaper.htm#primary). Your paper should be typed and double-spaced and at least 10.0 pages of text (this means to the absolute bottom of the tenth page), exclusive of the literature cited. For additional information and directions see the ["Instructions for Review Papers in Natural History of Vertebrates"](revpaper.htm). PAPERS THAT DO NOT MEET THESE VERY MINIMAL REQUIREMENTS CAN EXPECT A GRADE NO HIGHER THAN 70 OUT OF 100 POINTS (A "low C"). The format of your paper must follow exactly the style given in the "[Instructions for Review Papers in Natural History of Vertebrates](revpaper.htm)". Your paper will be graded on its scientific content and the coverage of the topic, in addition, the paper will be graded on grammar, clarity, and freedom from typographical and spelling errors. Papers are due at the beginning of class on 3 May 2002\. A 5-POINT PENALTY WILL BE ASSESSED IF IT IS TURNED IN AFTER CLASS. In addition, another 5-point penalty will be assessed for every day that the paper is late, and of course, days during holidays and weekends count as days late. Plagiarizing your paper from some other source or collaborative efforts with other students will be considered cheating and will result in a grade of zero for your efforts. Be sure to carefully read the section on plagiarizing and quoting from other sources in ["Instructions for Review Papers in Natural History of Vertebrates"](revpaper.htm#plagiarism). In addition, if you turn-in essentially this same paper for a different class, I will consider it cheating and give you a zero on the paper. Be sure to review the [Policies on Academic Dishonesty](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/dishbiol.htm) of [Emporia State University](http://www.emporia.edu/) and the [Division of Biological Sciences](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/biology.htm).  
  
**biography** The reason that I have required an autobiography is so that you
can begin to develop an understanding of who scientists are and how they came
to be scientists. This autobiography will introduce to one of the major
scientists of recent times. In addition to learning about the person about
whom the book is written, you will also see how the work of one scientist fits
with the work of other scientists. I hope that you will find the book
interesting of itself, however, there will be several homework assignments
associated with the book and these will not be accpeted late. If you have to
miss class for whatever reason, you can e-mail the answers to me by 5:00 PM on
the due date and I will still accept them. The text of your answers must be
embedded in the e-mail message. Do **NOT** send your answers as an attachment.  
     If you are using **Hotmail as your e-mail provider** , you will need to set your e-mail properties to "plain text only", otherwise I can not print your messages and ultimately grade your answers. If you can not accomplish this, then you should plan on handing in your answers in class. **You are responsible** for getting these answers to me in a form that I can read.  
  
**V. attendance:**  
  
     I will sometimes take attendance, even though I will not count lack of attendance against you. However, if you do not come to class, you will be unable to check if your understanding of the material is adequate. You should be committed enough to your education to come to class, otherwise you are just wasting your money.  
  
**VI. academic dishonesty:**  
  
     Plagiarism, which was mentioned above and is described in more detail in the ["Instructions for Review Papers in Natural History of Vertebrates"](revpaper.htm#plagiarism) will result in a zero on your term paper. In addition, any student who permits another student to use his/her work will get a zero on the assignment. Finally, any copying or other forms of cheating during a test will result in a zero on that exam. The Chair of the Division of Biological Sciences will be informed of all acts of academic dishonesty and the action taken against the offender. Be sure to review the [Policies on Academic Dishonesty](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/dishbiol.htm) of [Emporia State University](http://www.emporia.edu/) and the [Division of Biological Sciences](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/biology.htm).  
  
**VII. home page:**  
  
     There is a home page for this course on ESU's World Wide Web server. In addition, to the notes and the syllabus, there will be other information on the server that will be useful to you during the course. I would strongly encourage you to take advantage of this information during the course.

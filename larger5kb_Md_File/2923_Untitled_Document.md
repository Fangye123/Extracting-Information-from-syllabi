**Description** : Detailed study of the theatre history, theory, and
performance from its earliest manifestation to the late middle ages. We will
emphasize the connections between the social and historical circumstances of
the respective periods and their manifestations in drama and performance.
While the bulk of the material will cover the Western theatre, we will study
some African and Asian theatre, and we will spend considerable time on the
role of women in the theatre and the feminist critique of the Western theatre
traditions. The aim of the course is to familiarize you with the particular
periods and geographical areas of the theatre, and to develop a body of
knowledge that will allow you to see the connections as well as the
contradictions that form our understanding of it today.

  
**Writing** : Writing helps you to organize your thoughts and ideas in a
coherent form. To that effect writing papers will be an important part of the
course. In addition to the paper and exam requirements listed below, you will
be asked to write a short three-paragraph seminar paper for each class which
will form the basis for the seminar discussion. (see hand-out) Your papers and
take home exams will follow one of the standard formats as listed in "The
Everyday Writer" by Angela Lunsford. All papers need to be turned in on time
and the failure to do so will lower your grade.

  
**Performances and Creative Projects** : You will participate in two creative
projects. In the first project, (during the week after fall break) you will
present an acting/directing scene from one of the plays we have read. The
second project will be your final creative project and you will have the
choice of either presenting an acting/directing scene or you may choose to
present a scenic or costume design for one of the plays, masks, creative
dances or interpretations of the themes, or an other creation. I will ask you
to consult with me on the scope and the form of the final project with me in
advance. The projects will require space and material allocation from the
department, and it is important that all questions be cleared prior to the
actual presentation.

  
**Attendance and Class Etiquette** : The nature of a seminar requires your
presence. A successful seminar is based on discussion, and an informed
discussion presupposes the knowledge and prior reckoning with the material.
Please note that the recommended number of study hours for each semester
credit is three hours. That makes for about 12 hours of preparation a week.
Your short seminar papers should help you to facilitate such informed
discussion. You should treat your classmates with respect, engage them in a
positive way, and disagree respectfully. I encourage everyone to speak out in
the class but I strongly discourage dominating the class by two or three
strongly opinionated individuals.

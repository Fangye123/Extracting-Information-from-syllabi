> This syllabus is posted on the History Department website at
http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~history/courses/syllabi/201.htm During the term,
we will add relevant links of historical interest to the web version of the
syllabus. Check back periodically and you'll be on the information
superhighway to the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

> This is a course in American history from its beginnings through about 1830.
It is the first term of a three-term introduction to American history but each
term can be taken separately. Although we shall look at the political,
diplomatic and intellectual history of the period, the emphasis in the
lectures will be on social history. We will try to understand how different
groups--European, African and Native American; men, women and children; free
and slave; rich and poor--interacted with each other and with their
environment. How did these encounters form and alter American society?

>> Course Format and Requirements

>

>> This class will meet for lectures MWF 9:00-9:50. Attendance at the lectures
is strongly recommended. You will be responsible for material covered in class
as well as the readings. In addition to the lectures, each of you has signed
up for a one-hour discussion session each week. The discussions will focus on
the assigned books (other than the textbook) and documents in the course
packet; they will provide you an opportunity to clarify and respond to issues
raised in the lectures and other reading assignments. We will also use the
discussion sessions to review for exams and your paper. The first two exams
will be given in your sections too. Your discussion session leader will give
specific assignments for each week. Attendance at your discussion session each
week **is required**.

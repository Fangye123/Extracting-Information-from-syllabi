HISTORY OF ISLAMIC CIVILIZATION

This course focuses primarily on the formation of Islamic civilization in the
medieval Middle East and its diffusion out of the  
Middle East in late medieval and early modern times. While it was in seventh-
century Arabia that the Prophet Muhammad received the revelation and
established the first Muslim community or umma, Islamic civilization emerged
out of a much longer and more complex process that spanned chronologically
several centuries and geographically the whole area from Spain to Northern
India to Central Asia. We begin with a survey of the history of the umma from
its roots in seventh-century Arabia through the Mongol invasion and the formal
end of the Caliphate six centuries later. We then take up major institutional
and organizational patterns that were developed by medieval Islamic societies:
worship practices, shari'a law, sectarian divisions, the politics of
conversion, the concept of dhimmis ("protected" non-Muslim subjects),
household and military slavery, patterns of gender inequalities, patterns of
rural vs. urban life, modes of cultural transmission, etc. Next we examine
patterns and means through which, after the Mongol invasion, Islamic
civilization continued to spread into new areas and became incorporated into
local cultures extending all the way from Anatolia and the Balkans to Africa,
India, and Indonesia.

The point of the course is not to offer any systematic examination of modern
and contemporary issues, but rather to familiarize students with basic
concepts, patterns, and institutions and to offer a historical background
against which modern issues can be then better studied and understood. Toward
the end of the term we nevertheless attend, albeit briefly, to a number of
central concerns for modern and contemporary Muslim societies: the use of
Islam as a mode of protest; the centrality of gender to the politics of
modernization, identity and authenticity; and issues brought about by the
recent process of the globalization of Islam.

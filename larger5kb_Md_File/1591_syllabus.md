**PHILADELPHIA UNIVERSITY** \- School of Architecture and Design

A 331  History of Architecture and Interiors I                Fall 2001

**Type of Course** :    Conducted in a lecture format with occasional group
discussions, this is a three-credit required history/theory course for all
students in the architecture and interior design programs.

**Description** :    The first course in a four-term sequence in the history
of architecture and interiors, this class surveys key examples of Western and
non-Western architecture and interiors produced from Prehistory through the
beginnings of Christianity and Buddhism.  By tracing significant historical
themes, lectures emphasize the visual and conceptual components of the major
monuments of Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Students compare and
contrast the various historical styles and acquire a working vocabulary for
both analyzing and evaluating the built environment, as well as painting,
sculpture, and the decorative arts.

**Objectives** :    The primary objectives of this course are to instill:

| ![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| awareness of the theories and methods of
inquiry that seek to clarify the relationships between human behavior and the
physical environment;  
---|---  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| awareness of the diversity of needs,
values, behavioral norms, and social and spatial patterns that characterize
different cultures, and the implications of this diversity for the societal
roles and responsibilities of architects;  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| understanding of the Western architectural
canons and traditions in architecture, landscape, and urban design, as well as
the climatic, technological, socioeconomic, and other cultural factors that
have shaped and sustained them;  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| awareness of the parallel and divergent
canons and traditions of architecture and urban design in the non-Western
world; and  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| understanding of the shifts which occur --
and have occurred -- in the social, political, technological, ecological, and
economic factors that shape the practice of architecture (this is accomplished
by forming comparisons between artists, architects, and designers, diverse
periods and circumstances.

**Required texts** :

Blakemore, Robbie.  **History of Interior Design and Furniture, from Ancient
Egypt to Nineteenth Century Europe**.   Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1997.

Kleiner, Fred S., Christin J. Mamiya, and Richard G. Tansey.  **Gardner's Art
through the Ages**.   11th ed.  Harcourt College Publishers, 2001.

Trachtenberg, Marvin and Isabelle Hyman.  **Architecture from Prehistory to
Post-Modernism**.   Abrams, 1986.

**Procedures** :    During slide lectures, students are encouraged to discuss
the material at hand as well as take notes to assist them in studying for the
three exams.  Students will be required to visit the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology as part of a research
project.

**Completion requirements** :  The grade for this course is based on the
following (a student missing an exam or an assignment automatically fails the
course)

![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| three exams
50 %  
---|---  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| research project
40 %  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| participation and attendance          10 %  
  
**Exams** :    Exams consist of slide identification, short answers based on
slides, and identification of key terms.  You are responsible for works
discussed in class and reproduced in required textbooks or hand-outs.  Topics
lists provide the factual information you need to know (title of work,
artist/architect/designer, period, culture, location, and approximate date);
lectures and readings provide other important information about the works.
Make-up exams will not be given, unless the student can document a serious
illness or death in the family which conflicted with the exam.

**Visual Analysis / Research Project** :    See hand-out

**Attendance and Comportment** :    Class attendance and promptness are
critical for success in the course.  If you miss a class, it is your
responsibility to get notes and hand-outs from a classmate.  More than ten
absences results in a final grade of "F" for the course; arriving late for
class three times is the equivalent of one absence.  All assignments must be
submitted on or before the deadline.  Eating and drinking in class are not
permitted.

**Honesty** :    Cheating and plagiarism are prohibited by your Student Code
of Conduct and will be strictly enforced.  Even unintentional plagiarism is
wrong and ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse.  Plagiarists
misrepresent the ideas, words, or work that rightfully belong to another as
their own.  The proper use of the ideas, words, or word of another requires
that you acknowledge your source -- simply that you give your audience or
reader all the information needed to read or view the original source.

**Student archives** :    You are required to retain all work completed in
this course.  Some student work, representative of the course, will be
photographed for the School's records and some may become a permanent part of
the archives.  We retain our students' work because the assessment of student
work is important in securing accreditation by both FIDER (for interior
design) and NAAB (for architecture).

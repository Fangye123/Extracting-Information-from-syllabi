**OBJECTIVES**

As its title suggests, **"Introduction to Japan"** (or "Raw Fish 101" as it is
often called) is a basic introduction to Japanese history, politics, and
culture for undergraduates. This subject is also required of graduate interns
who will be placed in Japan under the auspices of the MIT Japan Program.

"Raw Fish" combines lectures, seminar discussion, small-team case studies, and
web page construction exercises, all designed to shed light on contemporary
Japan.

The course is organized around four substantive topics:

  1. Politics and History, 
  2. Education and the Workplace, 
  3. Economy and Technology, and 
  4. Community/Civil Society. 

Each topic is addressed in three separate class meetings. The first will be a
lecture, with time for Q&A.; The second will be a seminar discussion based
upon carefully selected readings on the same topic and guided by students'
questions. After we have had four sets of lectures and seminars on the topics,
we will have four sessions in which students will be responsible for two kinds
of classroom presentations:

  1. a group presentation of the issues associated with a case study provided by the instructors, and 
  2. The presentation of a web page developed by a second group of students. 

This course is, as advertised, merely an "introduction." We hope that you will
be stimulated to elect other subjects offered at MIT or elsewhere related to
Japanese studies, consider selection of a concentration in Japanese studies,
and/or travel to Japan for a closer look at this critically important,
technologically advanced nation.

* * *

**ORGANIZATION AND REQUIREMENTS**

The class will meet weekly on Monday afternoons. One additional two-hour
evening section to discuss the Web page and case study assignments is added on
31 October. Also, a double session has been scheduled for 2 December in order
to allow each group to make its final presentation. Pizza (and possibly sushi)
will be provided both evenings.

There are six requirements for the course:

  * Assigned readings 
  * **Mandatory** attendance at class 
  * Active class participation 
  * Two Discussion Questions **integrating the lecture and seminar readings** to be **e-mailed** to instructors **before** each seminar session. 
  * Case study presentations: The case studies require students to take and defend a point of view, based on what s/he has learned from lectures and seminar readings. By engaging the student in debate and critical thinking, we aim to enliven the key issues faced both by Japanese citizens and by students who encounter Japan. 
  * Web page construction: Groups of students will build and present to the class a web page that addresses the core concepts and information sources pertaining to that week's topic. 

There are no examinations in this course. There are no paper assignments.
Grades are pass/fail.

**PROCEDURE FOR CASE STUDIES AND WEB PAGE PRESENTATIONS**

This course will end with four sessions divided equally between a case study
exercise and presentation of a web page built expressly for the seminar. In
order to make learning from the case studies and web pages effective (and
hopefully fun), we will divide the class into four teams, one for each topic:

  1. Politics and History, 
  2. Education and the Workplace, 
  3. Economy and Technology, and 
  4. Community. 

Each team will be responsible for one case and one web page during the
semester.

* * *

**CASE STUDIES**

In developing the team's case study presentation, team members should meet to
discuss and prepare a coordinated presentation in class for 10-15 minutes on
their designated day. A discussion topic and exercise questions are appended
to each case. Each team should select a captain who will coordinate a
discussion on the case either in person or via email with his/her team
members, summarize the discussion, and forward the results to TA Pat Boyd
(email: [jpboyd@mit.edu](mailto:jpboyd@mit.edu)) no later than the Tuesday
preceding the class. You should use your imagination and what you have learned
from lectures and readings to come up with inventive solutions to the problems
each case study presents. Other teams should come to class prepared to discuss
the case. Make sure to check the guidelines for preparing case studies, at
<http://web.mit.edu/17.s21/www/cases.html>.

* * *

**WEB PAGE CONSTRUCTION**

The assigned group is responsible for meeting in person or electronically to
discuss the contents and format of a web page related to their assigned topic.
As with the case study presentations, a captain should be selected who will
coordinate the page and present the concepts to Pat Boyd no later than the
week before its demonstration in class. We will have set up a computer with
projection capabilities for that session. Use as many of the resources of the
Web as is possible, but go beyond the Web when necessary. The objective is to
establish a site filled with useful information about a new institution or
product **for the intended target**. For each topic the designated team will
choose one of three suggested themes and construct a web site for presentation
to the class.

The web pages must be compelling and must reflect the information that you
have learned about Japan. Consider carefully what part of the Japanese or
foreign population you are trying to reach and why. You should draw from your
readings as well as other published material on Japan. Your web page should be
a sophisticated reflection of careful study and understanding of the
situation. The team leader should present with the help of one or two others.
The presentation should be an explanation and a defense.

**Politics and History (pick _one_ theme)**

  1. A web page promoting a new political party to Japanese voters that promises major structural reform.
  2. A web page describing the Imperial Household to foreigners.
  3. A web page for Japanese citizens describing a new government office to promote activities that would foster better Sino-Japanese relations. 

**Education/Workplace (pick _one_ theme)**

  1. A web page aimed at for Japanese parents to advertise a new private school focusing on a curriculum to promote creativity. 
  2. A web page appealing to potential employees that promotes a Japanese start-up software firm currently having difficulty recruiting from leading universities. 
  3. A web page for a work relocation service to help workers who have been  "restructured."

**Community/Civil Society(pick _one_ theme) **

  1. Advertisement on web page for a new community center with activities in a working class district with a large and diverse immigrant population. 
  2. A police department web page explaining their responsibilities and services to the community. 
  3. A web page for the National Association of Shinto Shrines to attract donations from the public. 

**Economy and Technology (pick _one_ theme) **

  1. A web page for a _keiretsu_ -affiliated electronics company seeking to introduce new telecommunications products to the Japanese market during the current recession. 
  2. A web page to promote a new R&D; center for local firms, established by a prefectural government. 
  3. A web page by a freign investment comopany to attract savings from Japanese middle class investors. 

**We hope that you will, as always, be as creative as possible. But do make
sure you inform your creativity with an appreciation of contemporary Japan.**

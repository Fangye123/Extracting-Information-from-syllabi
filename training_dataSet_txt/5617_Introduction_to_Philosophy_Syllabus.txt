I. COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course introduces the general nature of philosophical thought, and its 
basic methods and goals. The material covered includes selections by both 
historically important and current philosophers (e.g., Plato, Descartes, 
Russell, Frankfurt, Williams) on such classic philosophical topics as the 
existence of God, the nature of right and wrong, and the possibility of 
knowledge. Through our readings and discussions we will also attempt to reach a 
clearer understanding of ourselves (personhood), our relationship to other 
people (moral responsibility), and our relationship to the world around us 
(freedom of the will). Some of the general skills students will develop include 
the formulating and defending of theoretical positions and the ability to think 
critically about difficult and abstract issues.

III. CLASS REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING SCHEME
Requirements.............................................Percent of 
Final Grade
  Class Participation......................................................10% 
  
  Midterm Exam............................................................25%
  Paper...........................................................................30%
  Final Exam..................................................................35% 
  

About the Requirements:
Class Participation--One thing this requirement covers is your 
class attendance (if you don't attend class you can't participate in it). 
However, to get an "A" for class participation you must do more than just show 
up; you have to contribute to class discussion. You are expected to show up 
having read the assignment for the day and ready to talk about it.  Note:  Anyone who has unexcused absences for more than half the class meetings automatically fails the course.
The Midterm Exam--There will be a timed, in-class midterm exam at the 
  end of February. The exam will consist of short answer questions and an essay.
The Required Paper--There will be a 4-6 page paper due in late 
  March. Topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is due, and all papers 
  are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late papers will be 
  subject to a substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out 
  how much).
The Optional Paper--There will be a second, optional 4-6 page paper 
  due in late April. Topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is due. 
  If your write the optional paper, then your paper grade will be the higher of 
  the two you receive.
The Final Exam--There will be a timed (2 hour), in-class final exam 
  given during the scheduled exam time for the class (5/7 for Sec. 07; 5/2 for Sec. 08). The   final will consist of short answer questions and essay questions heavily emphasizing, but not limited to, the material covered since the midterm.

IV. CLASS FORMAT
The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want to 
encourage discussion. I hope that you will all have views about the topics we 
will address, and I want you to express and explore those views. It is the 
nature of the issues we will be considering that people's views will differ. You 
are encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when anyone says something 
you disagree with, but everyone should always keep in mind that disagreement is 
not a personal attack. Philosophical discussion thrives under this kind of 
interaction and often stems from disagreement. At the same time, philosophical 
discussion aims at reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't 
reach agreement every time, but we should aspire toward it.
 
V. TOPICS AND READINGS
Most of the readings will be from the Perry and Bratman book. These will be 
listed by their page numbers in parentheses. Readings from the Nagel book are 
listed by chapter number.
A note about the readings: Philosophical writing is often subtle and 
  difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking 
  that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read at least 
  twice. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second pass 
  taking notes. 
The course will be divided into 5 units.  Those units and the readings for them are as follows.

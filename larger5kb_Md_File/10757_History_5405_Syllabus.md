  **Overview** This graduate reading seminar is intended to familiarize
students with the most significant scholarship on some of the important issues
of southern history since the Civil War. Although the class is not
comprehensive, students should gain a broad command of the literature on the
modern South. The emphasis is overwhelmingly on recent scholarship; the field
of southern history has been evolving rapidly in the past decade or so and
older interpretative paradigms are crumbling. Even so, historiographical
introductions, which will open each seminar class, should familiarize students
with older scholarship. My goal is to offer a seminar which will provide you
with a sound grasp of material which may appear on your qualifying exams,
which might be relevant to future classes you may teach, or which may inform
your future research interests.  
  **Assigned Readings:** There are only three assigned readings that the class
will read collectively:  

1) Eric Foner, _A Short History of Reconstruction, 1863-1877  _  
2) Ed Ayers, _The Promise of the New South: Life after Reconstruction_  
3) Numan Bartley, _The New South, 1945-1980_  

Copies of these books are available through Amazon.com.

On those weeks when there is no specific assigned reading, each student should
select one book from the list of "Suggested Individual Readings." In other
words, each student will be expected to read a book a week, but not
necessarily the same book that any other student in the class is reading. This
method of collective reading will allow, indeed demand, that the class pool
its collective knowledge. Discussion will be enriched by multiple
perspectives. You must keep up with the reading. The structure of the seminar
rests upon the contributions of each student; you must be prepared to
contribute your knowledge of specific works to the discussion. Each book must
be read, and read carefully.  
  **Assignments:** Each student will be expected to complete a variety of
written assignments. These assignments are intended to hone critical,
analytical skills and to present them in a variety of forms comparable to
those commonplace in scholarly journals.  
    
Each student will:

1) deliver 1 (one) historiographic introduction to a seminar class. The
introduction will be a 15 minute survey of the historiography on the week's
particular topic. The introduction will frame the day's discussion and
familiarize the class with older historiography. The presenting student will
turn in a 7-8 page historiographic essay on the day prior to the seminar
meeting at which she/he will present.

2) produce 4 (four) 500-750 word reviews of four of the works that he/she read
during the  
semester. This task is intended to develop each student's ability to write
crisp, concise, but analytically rigorous reviews along the lines of those
published in scholarly journals. Each review will be due during the class in
which the specific work is relevant. I will gathered the reviews and posted
them on a web site so that by the conclusion of the class each student will
have access to peer reviews of a broad swath of the recent scholarship on the
modern South.

3) write a 20 page historiographic essay on a topic of the student's choice
(pending my  
approval). The essay may address a specific topic (e.g., the black middle
class and the rise of segregation, white women and religious reform during the
Progressive era) or a broad thematic issue (e.g., gender and southern labor
history, postmodernism and the historiography of southern culture). Once each
student has selected a topic, I will expect her/him to familiarize
herself/himself with the relevant literature. The essay should explain the
historiographic significance of the topic, trace the evolution of scholarship
on it, and offer some critical assessment of how the scholarship may or should
develop in the future.

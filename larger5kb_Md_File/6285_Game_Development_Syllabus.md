**Course Description:** This class is a practical primer for anyone interested
in a career in the rapidly evolving industry of video gaming. It is an
intense, project based course in which we will closely follow the actual game
development cycle, with each team producing a complete PC game.

**Objective:** My objective is to give anyone who is interested in entering
the gaming industry the skill set necessary to compete. Developing video games
takes a myriad of talents: art, programming, design, and most importantly, the
ability to work in a team and communicate with others. There are also a number
of myths about what it's  "really like" to work for a game development
company, and hopefully this course will give a better idea of what it's really
like.

**Course Policies**

**Preparation and Attendance** : This is a hands-on course. Although
attendance is not technically required, it is encouraged as strongly as
possible. You are a member of a team, and **constant** communication with your
team is necessary. It is not sufficient to  "get your assignment", skip class
for two weeks, and show up when it's due. Requirements and designs change
almost daily, and you must keep up with the most current design, as well as
contribute ideas of your own. There will be no "grunt workers" in this class.
There will also be numerous peer evaluation periods, where everyone evaluates
everyone else's work, and you are expected to attend.

**Academic Honesty** : Student relationships are built on mutual respect and
trust. Students must be able to trust that their teachers have made
responsible decisions about the structure and content of the course and that
they are conscientiously making their best effort to help students learn.
Teachers must be able to trust that students do their work conscientiously and
honestly making their best effort to learn. Acts that violate this mutual
respect and trust undermine the educational process. They counteract our very
reason for being here at Rensselaer and will not be tolerated. Any student who
engages in any form of academic dishonesty wiil receive an F in this course
and will be reported to the Dean of Students for further disciplinary action.
The Rensselaer Handbook defined various forms of Academic Dishonesty and
procedures for responding to them. All of these forms are violations of trust
between students and teachers. Please familiarize yourself with this portion
of the handbook.

**Gender-fair language** : Because the way we speak and write affects the way
we think, everyone in this course is expected to use gender-fair language in
all discussions and writing. A guide to gender-fair language is available from
the Writing Center and from the Library.

**Grading:** Your grade will be mainly determined by one thing: whether you do
what you say you will do. For this reason, the scope of your project is
absolutely critical. Once your team establishes your game on paper, it will be
reviewed by myself and the support personnel, to determine whether your
project is too easy or too difficult. From that point on, grades will be
determined by the quality of work at each milestone. See the following table:  

|

**Milestone**

|

**Percentage of Grade**  
  
---|---  
Treatment | 5%  
Preliminary GDD/TDD | 10%  
All Specifications | 15%  
Prototype/LDD | 15%  
1st playable | 15%  
Alpha | 15%  
Beta | 25%  
  
  
Peer evaluations are for constructive criticism only, your grades are not
dependent on them. However, at various milestone deadlines (not all 7), you
will evaluate your teammates, which do factor into your grade. There is no
final exam.

**Assignments/Milestones:** The milestones are defined as follows:  
_Treatment_ \- 2 page  "vision statement", designed to convey idea of game to
publisher.  
_Preliminary GDD/TDD_ \- 5 pages each, a Game Design Document and a Technical
Design Document. Includes conceptual art, begins to discuss game architecture
and high-level data structures/classes.  
_All Specifications_ \- Compete Game Design Document, Art Design Document,
Technical Design Document, Engineering Design Document, and Audio Design
Document (optional)  
_Prototype/LDD_ \- Level Design Document (level maps, usually on grid paper,
includes hazards and obstacles) and concept game engine. Prototype defines
look and feel (art style), as well as player handling and gameplay. Some
character animations.  
_1st Playable_ \- Player handling (interface) refined, includes at least one
full level. Contains some special effects, and included enemies with
accompanying AI  
_Alpha_ \- Game is feature complete. Contains all levels and content, game can
be played from start to finish. May still contain some placeholder art. Buggy!  
_Beta_ \- Finished! (or so you think) No obvious or glaring bugs. This is
where you would send the game for final QA and external testing before
declaring it to be Gold.

**About the Instructor** : I am the Technical Director of the Minds & Machines
Laboratory and Program here at RPI. I've been here for a total of seven years
now, having received my B.S. in Computer Science and Psychology in 1998, and
an M.S. in Cognitive Systems Engineering in May 2001. I have been interested
in gaming all my life, and have background training in game design, general
programming, graphics programming, artificial intelligence, interface design,
body language, cognition, and clinical psychology. My interests are very
broad, ranging from hypnosis to origami to application development to
professional wrestling.

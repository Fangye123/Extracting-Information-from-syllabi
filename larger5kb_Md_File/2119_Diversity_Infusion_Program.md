*Makeups only with instructor's permission 

**Withdrawals** : It is the student's responsibility to withdraw officially
from class if personal circumstances require it. The deadline for student-
initiated withdrawal is Friday, March 9.

** **Attendance** : This course depends upon classroom input, data collection
and discussion. Attendance, good listening skills, effective note taking and
classroom contributions are essential in order to do well on tests.

The instructor may assign extra credit opportunities throughout the semester.
These papers must be typed in order to be graded and to receive extra points
which are added directly to the student's total.

You as a student can compute your grade during the semester by taking the
number of points you haver earned and dividing them by the number of points
available to that date. For instance, if you have taken two tests (totaling
73), attended all classes and earned 2 extra credits for a total of 100 out of
125 for an 80%, a B.

**Students agree to accept and to comply with these requirements by choosing
to remain enrolled after receiving these course conditions.**

**Cell phones, watches and pagers must be turned off during class and
especially on evaluation days. If this is a problem for you, see me
personally.**

Effective Note taking: (adapted from Paulk's "Cornell System")

  1. **Record** concepts/ideas from lecture. Leave space on pages. Highlight key words.
  2. **Revise** by filling in omissions after class or during breaks.
  3. **Reduce** ideas/facts to concise phrases or key words from notes taken.
  4. **Recite** : Tell yourself and teach it to others.
  5. **Reflect** upon the material and process it.
  6. **Review** ; go over it at least 6 times.

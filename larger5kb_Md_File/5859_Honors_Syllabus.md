This class traces the history of Western Europe from the time of the ancient
Greeks and Romans through the age of Shakespeare. Its focus is largely
political. We will look at the birth of democracy under the ancient Greeks,
the decline of republican institutions during the middle ages, and the rise of
constitutional monarchy after the English civil war.

**Course Requirements and Grading:**

Requirements for the course consist of three tests, a research paper (8-10
pages) and an oral presentation. The tests and exam will contain map
identifications, reading  & analysis and essay questions. All questions will
be drawn from your lecture notes and readings. NO MAKEUP EXAMS WILL BE
PERMITTED except under extraordinary circumstances.

Ten percent of your grade will be based on your attendance and class
participation. When I total your grade at the end of the semester, I will add
up the following percentage points: 0-1 unexcused absences = 5; 2-3 unexcused
absences = 4; 4-5 unexcused absences = 3; 6-8 unexcused absences = 2; 8 or
more unexcused absences = 0. Your performance in class will be assigned the
following characteristics and percentage points: "talks, asks questions" =
4-5; "doesn't talk in class but works well in small group discussion" = 3;
"barely adequate performance" = 2; "not present and accounted for" = 0.

Absences are excused for any illness or injury, for participation in any
university-sponsored event, and for a death or serious illness in the family.
Absences are not excused for weddings, family excursions, and carelessly-
scheduled travel itineraries. A note, signed by a nurse, physician, R.A., or
other University official, is necessary to excuse an absence.

Your final grade in the course will be based on the following:

    60 % Three tests, each worth 20 %  

     30 % Research paper and oral presentation

**Course Objectives:** History 202 introduces the student to the basic
outlines of American History from 1877 to the present. The focus is on social,
cultural, political, and economic development in the United States. Topics
include prominent people, ideas, and events that shaped the path of American
history, with a special focus on the lives of ordinary people, women, African
Americans, and Native Americans.

Each student should gain a general knowledge of American history appropriate
for an educated human being. Students should learn how to develop informed and
critical judgements on major long-range trends in American life. Each student
should gain an understanding of the international and multi-cultural
dimensions of the American experience.

Through essay examinations, written exercises, and question and answer
periods, students should learn how to read, write, and speak English clearly
and correctly. Each student should learn how to use the resources of Love
Library and the various computer labs on the UNL campus.



**Requirements:** Attendance at all lecture sessions is essential. Tardiness
and talking during class is rude and has no place in the academic community.
The instructor asks that in the event of an absence, students either telephone
or e-mail the reason for missing class. If the student must be late, please be
considerate to fellow classmates and do not cause a disturbance when entering
the room.

There will be at least 10 quizzes throughout the semester as well as one mid-
term and one final examination. The other major portion of the grade will be a
writing assignment based on the additional readings.

Students must take all quizzes and examinations on the scheduled day. **If any
quiz or examination must be missed only a WRITTEN EXCUSE regarding the death
of an immediate relative or personal injury (i.e. smallpox, surgery, etc.)
will be viewed as legitimate reasons for missing class. Any make-ups will be
taken at the end of the semester.**

Each student should get an e-mail account and become familiar with the use of
the Internet as portions of this class will be made available on a home page.

the significance of each is essential for full credit. Part two will be an
essay question drawn from lecture, the readings, or both.

Each student must submit at least one blue book per exam with their name
written on the outside cover at least one week prior to the scheduled exam
day. Blue books will be distributed to the students on the day of the exam.

There will be at least ten quizzes throughout the semester to be held on
unannounced Fridays. They will be based on that week's readings from the text,
additional books, or reserve assignment. Each quiz will be worth 10 points.

[The writing assignment, to be distributed later, will be worth 50
points.](Writing.htm)

It is possible to gain 350 points during the semester, but in the event that

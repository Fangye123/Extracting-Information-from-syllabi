# Course Requirements

## Required Texts

Carol Sheriff, _**The Artificial River: The Erie Canal and the Paradox of
Progress 1817-1862_**  
Steven Mintz, _**Moralists and Modernizers: America's Pre-Civil War
Reformers_**  
Jack Larkin, _**The Reshaping of Everyday Life: 1790- 1840_**  

## Readings

All articles listed as JSTOR readings, can be found by clicking on the button
located next to the article name or by doing a search via the JSTOR logo
button in the reference section of this syllabus. You should always print
JSTOR readings and bring them to class. Other readings can be found in the
required texts or in reserved reading at UGA Library. You should also
photocopy reserved readings and bring them to class.  
  
**Tests:** There will be NO tests in this class.  
  

## Writing:

1\. Each student will write two 5-page reviews of books.
**Click[here](4000read.htm)** to see the list of suggestions, with their
scheduled due dates. **Click[here](reviews.htm)** to see which books your
classmates have already picked out to review. This is not a book report, but a
review. For a journal with good examples, click
[here](http://www.press.jhu.edu/demo/rah/). You can also find examples of
history book reviews in [JSTOR](http://www.jstor.org/jstor/). Each written
review will count 10% toward the final grade.  
  
2\. Each student will also complete a 10-15 page research assignment in which
s/he will place at least three related antebellum newspaper articles (from
Athens) in historical context. A database of newspaper articles will be
provided by the instructor. Please bring a dos-formatted disk to class to
receive a copy of this windows-based database. However, students may ask for
access to other topics after consulting with the instructor. Click
[here](http://h-net2.msu.edu/~africa/citation.html) for a version of the
Turabian manual of style for citations in the footnotes and the bibliography.
Use the general citation framework, although the specifics of this site are
aimed at electronic sources. A fuller description of Turabian style footnotes,
endnotes, and bibliographies can be found on a handout in the library, located
on a shelf directly opposite from the reference desk. If you still are in
doubt about how to do notes and bibliographies, purchase a copy of _Turabian's
Manual for Writers of Term Papers_ at the bookstore. The research assignment
will count 35% of the final course grade.  
  
3\. Each student must also prepare a version of the research assignment in
html for permanent publication on the Athens/Clarke County Regional Library
web site, as part of the county's bicentennial celebration. I encourage your
best efforts, since the result will be available on the web for all to see for
some time to come. Web publication will count 5% of your grade. To see a
tutorial of how to insert html codes into your papers, click
[here](http://www.gactr.uga.edu/exploring/html.html).  
  
4\. A quick note about plagiarism. Plagiarism is the quoting or the
paraphrasing of any portion of another author's words or ideas without giving
full credit to the original author. In short, it is theft of intellectual
property. It violates UGA's honor code, and will be dealt with SEVERELY.  
  
5\. **Paper Deadlines:** As in a job, deadlines cannot be ignored without
serious consequences. Missing one will negatively affect my assessment of your
job performance. All deadlines are for the start of class period, and I expect
you to hand deliver it to me, in class.

## Presentations:

1\. Since each week will have 6 to 8 book reviews due, those reviewers will
act as a team to plan and implement the pedagogy (the teaching) of the class
for the week in which his or her book review is due, in order to share the
information from the book with the rest of the class.  
  
2\. Each team will meet independently of class to plan the techniques of
introducing their information and incorporating a discussion of the readings
required of all students of the class. The plan must seek to involve the rest
of the class as active participants, so that I can evaluate the preparedness
of each student. I encourage creativity in making your lesson plans, but I
also require that each team meet with me a week prior to their week to explain
their plan and each team members' role in implementing the plan. I reserve the
right to veto a plan at our meeting prior to the day of your presentation, but
I don't anticipate doing so. Examples of different interactive pedagogical
approaches might include (but would not be limited to): a game show, a debate,
a trial, a panel discussion, role playing, etc. Each team sets the parameters.
Be creative. We may wind up video taping the student directed classes.  
  
3\. Each presentation counts 15% of the final grade. The final 15 minutes of
each week will be taken up with an evaluation of the content and competency of
that week's teaching by the students who received the instruction. I will
consider these evaluations when assigning presentation grades.  
  

## Participation:

Active participation in class discussions will count 10% of your final grade.
Student presenters will evaluate the participation of their classmates by
ranking them according to their interaction with the pedagogical plan. The
instructor will use these evaluations, in conjunction with his own
evaluations, in determining each student's final participation grade. To see
current student evaluations both by presenters and by student participants,
click [here](4000eval.htm)  
  

## Attendance:

1\. Since part of your grade is based on your participation, attendance is
required. I will check role daily. Three unexcused absences will result in an
instructor initiated withdrawal from the class with a failing grade. Failure
to prepare for class is equivalent to failing to attend. If it is apparent
that you are not prepared for class, I will dismiss you from class, and count
the dismissal as an unexcused absence. I will be the sole judge of who is
prepared.  
  
2\. An unexcused absence of a team member during the week of their
presentation will result in instructor initiated withdrawal of the student
with a failing grade. Lack of preparation will equal an unexcused absence.

to go. This field trip is actually for another class of mine, but If you want
to go, I will include you in our transportation plans. If I've made space for
your and then you fail to show up, I will be very unhappy. So don't say you
plan to attend unless you are really serious about it. See the [Georgia

homepage, before you go, so you can do some advance research, and plan your
research trip wisely.

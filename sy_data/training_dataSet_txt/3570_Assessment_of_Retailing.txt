Assessment Results


Educational Quality and Completeness

All students in the College of Hospitality, Retailing and Sport Management are required to
complete a set of course requirements in English, History, Foreign Language, Science,
 Mathematics, Humanities and Social Sciences prior to graduation. To insure quality of 
instruction in the Major, all core retailing courses are taught by 
permanent Retailing faculty.
Course Progression and Grade Requirements

All undergraduate students are required to meet the minimum progression of the Department. 
Overall grade point requirements and grade point deficit actions are monitored and acted 
upon by the College of Hospitality, Retailing and Sport Management.
Student Satisfaction
Student Course Evaluations 

The average course evaluation for the college is consistently 
above 4.0 on a 5.0 scale for the past five years. These results are 
consistent with the high quality of our teaching faculty, and with our
 commitment to providing the best undergraduate retailing program 
available in the Southeast.
Academic Advisement/Mentorship 

All faculty are required to post office hours on their course 
syllabus or beside their office doors and to be available in their 
office a minimum of one hour for each hour of class taught. 
Furthermore, all undergraduates are assigned to a faculty advisor 
when entering the department. Although students are free to change 
advisors; under normal circumstances one faculty member will be the 
student's mentor and advisor for his/her entire undergraduate career.
 All faculty are involved in this advisement process and no 
professional or student advisors are used. Students must meet with 
their advisor a minimum of once per semester. Failure to do so results 
in the inability of the student to register for the following 
semester's classes.

**The purpose of History 505 is to introduce the beginning graduate student to
the fundamentals of historical method. In lectures, readings, and discussion,
instructor and students explore major questions pertinent to the professional
practice of history, including the nature of the discipline itself, the nature
of historical "fact," and problems inherent in assessing the reliability,
meaning, and relevance of historical evidence. The course also includes
practical experience in research design, bibliographic and archival research
and note taking, internal criticism of historical sources, analysis,
synthesis, writing and editing. Each student will produce a paper based upon a
guided program of original research.**

**This course is conducted as a seminar. Webster defines a seminar as "a group
of advanced students studying under a professor with each doing original
research and all exchanging results through reports and discussions."
Accordingly, the traditional instructional methods of lecture and examination
are deemphasized, while a greater responsibility is placed upon the individual
student to prepare materials for presentation in class.**

  **CORE TOPIC.** If we are to learn to work as historians, we must have
something to work on.   For this reason, there will be an established core
topic of inquiry. This quarter, the core topic is "U.S. Foreign Policy in the
Early Cold War, 1945-1969." All papers must relate to this topic in some clear
fashion. The core topic is chosen because of its considerable intrinsic
interest, and because of the abundance of primary sources available locally to
support your research.

**READINGS.** Each student is expected to purchase and read the following
books, which are available in the University Bookstore:  
  Barzun, Jacques, and Henry F. Graff. _The Modern Researcher_. 5th ed. New
York: Harcourt, Brace, Jovanovich, 1992.  
---  
Brundage, Anthony. _Going to the Sources: A Guide to Historical Research and
Writing_. Arlington Heights, Ill.: Harlan Davidson, 1989.  
Strunk, William, and E. B. White. _The Elements of Style_. 3rd ed. New York:
Macmillan, 1979.  
**[Turabian, Kate L.](505turabian.htm)** _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers,
Theses, and Dissertations_. Rev. by John Grossman and Alice Bennett. 6th ed.
Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1996.  
  
In addition, you are expected to master and apply the principles set forth in
the following article:  
  **[Merrill, Horace Samuel.](505merrill.htm) ** "Basic Rules for Writing
History." ****_The Maryland Historian,_ ser. 1, no. 1 (Spring, 1980), 3-10.  
---  
We will discuss these books and the Merrill article at length in class. They
should be a permanent part of the personal library of anyone professionally
engaged in the practice of history or in any other activity which involves the
writing of reports based upon the collection and analysis of evidence.

**HANDOUTS.   **History 505 involves many handouts.  These handouts are
available for photocopying at the Circulation Department Reserve Desk,
Prescott Memorial Library.  They are also accessible via the Internet.  Some
handouts are .htm files and can be accessed directly from the links provided
in this syllabus and accompanying documents.  Others are .pdf documents and
must be accessed via **[Electronic Reserve](505eres.htm).  ** For a master
list of handouts and the appropriate links to them, access the **[Handouts
Checklist.](505hand.htm)**

Handouts will **_not_** be distributed in class.   It is your responsibility
to retrieve them and bring them to class on the night for which they are
assigned (see **Course Calendar** ).

**INTERNET AND E-MAIL.**   By Friday, September 14, 2001, you must supply me
with a valid, active e-mail address.  All students enrolled at Louisiana Tech
University are entitled to free networked computer access.  If you do not have
Internet access on your own and have not already opened your Internet account
at Louisiana Tech, please do so without delay.  This is done at the Computing
Center in the basement of Wyly Tower and it requires a valid student
identification card.  In History 505, we will use e-mail to communicate with
one another between class meetings.  Also, you will need reliable access to
the World Wide Web, because the syllabus and other required materials will
**_not_** be distributed in hard copy.

**RESEARCH PROJECTS.** In order to gain practical experience in both research
and writing, you will undertake a research project on a topic chosen in
consultation with the instructor. Topics chosen must be appropriate to the
aims of the course, that is, they must be such that there are sufficient
_primary sources_ available locally to do them and that they can be completed
within the limited time available. The "research" phase of the project must be
completed early enough in the quarter to permit due attention to the "writing"
phase. I will encourage you to adhere to a rigorous timetable by requiring a
series of scheduled individual tutorials.

**TIME LINE FOR PRESENTATIONS:** You will communicate the results of your
research in both written and oral reports as follows (see **Course Calendar,**
below, for specific due dates):  
  **What?**   |  **When?**  
---|---  
**Progress reports.** Intermediate oral reports made in seminar (approximately
two to five minutes). |  Weekly  
**Individual Tutorial Sessions:**   Exhibition and explanation of research
materials as specified in advance.  | Weeks 2, 4, and 8  
**Mid-term oral report.** An oral report given at mid-term, briefly describing
the _primary_ and _secondary sources_ you have found to be most useful for
your research and discussing any problems of access or interpretation
(approximately ten minutes). |  Week 5  
**Annotated bibliography.** Consisting of at least twenty-five items, a
written, annotated bibliography to accompany the mid-term oral report. This
bibliography will be duplicated for distribution to all members of the
seminar.   If you are not certain how to annotate a bibliography, see
Turabian, 6th ed., item 9.36. |  Week 5  
**Preliminary draft.** A preliminary written draft of the final paper to be
submitted on the date specified, edited by me, and returned to you for
revision. |  Week 7  
**Final draft.** The final draft of the research paper, which will not be
shorter than twelve pages or longer than sixteen (excluding notes and other
scholarly apparatus). The final draft will incorporate revisions and
corrections and will be prepared according to accepted professional standards.
|  Week 9  
**Final oral presentation.** An oral presentation (fifteen minutes maximum)
devoted to the paper topic. |  Week 10  
**Oral critique.** An oral critique (approximately five minutes) of another
student's paper, as assigned by the instructor. |  Week 10  
**Written critique.**   A written summary of your critique (approximately 100
words). |  Week 10  


**OTHER ASSIGNMENTS.** In addition to the major research project, I may also
from time to time make short reading assignments or assign practical exercises
to be done at home and discussed in seminar the following week.

**ASSESSMENT.** Most assignments and tasks are ungraded, but I will provide
you with frequent detailed assessments of your progress, as well as
opportunities for self-assessment. The final assessment (final grade) will
rest most heavily on the finished product, that is, the final draft of the
research paper, with appropriate weight given to the effectiveness of the
final oral presentation and the assigned oral and written critiques of another
student's paper.

**GRADUATE SCHOOL FACTS OF LIFE.**   The working assumption in the Department
of History is that, as graduate students, you are aware of and accept the
following "facts of life."  To leave no doubt, I include these handy
reminders:  
  **GRADUATE SCHOOL FACTS OF LIFE**  
---  
**1** |  Except in cases of clear necessity, a serious graduate student does
not "cut" seminar meetings, arrive late, or leave early. Work involving class
participation cannot be "made up."  
  **2** |  Assignments and presentations are due at the time and date
specified. Because one important objective of this course is an introduction
to professional responsibility, considerable emphasis is placed on the timely
and proper completion of assigned tasks. **Substantial grade penalties may
result from missed deadlines, regardless of reason.**  
**3** |  All written work prepared for submission in a seminar will be
typewritten or word processed and double-spaced. Papers will adhere to
professional standards of presentation as set forth in **[Turabian's _Manual
for Writers_](505turabian.htm)** and in the **[History 505
Guidelines.](505guide.htm)** **Written assignments which do not meet these
standards will be returned unread.**  
**4** |  All written work submitted must be logically organized and free of
grammatical, punctuation, spelling, and typographical errors. Careful
proofreading is essential. It is assumed that you understand that, in this
respect, there is no difference between an "English paper" and any other kind
of formal writing.  
  **5**  
  | **No paper will be accepted for graduate credit which does not meet the
following minimal criteria established by the Department of English for
passing freshman composition courses:**   | There must be a stated thesis and
stated topics that control the development of the essay.  
---  
There must be coherent, specific, and logical development.  
There may be no more than ten (10) serious errors (e.g., sentence fragments;
run-on sentences; comma errors; subject-verb agreement errors; verb form
errors; pronoun case, agreement, and reference errors; and modifier errors).  
In the unlikely event that I find you to be seriously deficient in matters of
English composition, I will counsel you to repeat English 100 and 102 before
proceeding with further graduate-level work.  
**6** |  Examinations of the traditional sort are ordinarily not part of the
seminar experience. However, I reserve the right to administer a written
examination at or near the end of the quarter should I determine that the
attitude or performance of the class as a whole warrants an additional
assessment measure.  
**7** |  A serious graduate student will never discard or misplace handouts,
class notes, reading notes, or other written work once the term is over.
Issues discussed in class and in student projects tend to surface again during
the comprehensive examinations.  Specifically, issues discussed in History 505
will come up again in every seminar paper you write and in your MA thesis.

critique of another person's paper.   Turn in a 100-word written summary of
your critique._  


**IMPORTANT:** Approximately 25 minutes will be required for each presentation
and response, so the final seminar meeting may exceed the scheduled time
period. This is regrettable, but necessary, and you should plan accordingly.
Should the class prefer, I will happily schedule a second meeting during the
same week to complete the presentations.

**AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.**   If you require special testing or
classroom accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you must
meet with me immediately so that I can make the necessary arrangements early
in the quarter.  All requests for accommodations under ADA must be accompanied

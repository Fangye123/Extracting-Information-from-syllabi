[**OUR TENTATIVE SCHEDULE**](http://www.intermath-
uga.gatech.edu/tweb/gwin1-01/ClassDocs/schedule.htm)

**Prerequisites** :

You must be a middle school mathematics teacher or administrator to take this
course. Teachers are expected to have basic knowledge about the operation and
use of a computer. Teachers are expected to have mathematics technologies in
their school or home in the form of a Graphing Calculator 3.0, Excel (or other
spreadsheet), and Geometer's SketchPad. Teachers will need internet access and
Netscape is recommended.

**Objectives** :

> To become familiar with and operational with using technology tools in doing
mathematics.  
>  To use application software to solve mathematics problems.  
>  To use application software to create mathematics demonstrations.  
>  To use application software to construct new ideas of mathematics for
yourself.  
>  To engage in mathematical investigations using software applications.  
>  To engage in some independent investigations of mathematics topics from the
middle school curriculum or appropriate for that level.  
>  To communicate mathematics ideas that arise from mathematics applications
on a computer.  
>  To communicate mathematics ideas using various technology tools.  
>  To use general tools such as word processing, paint and draw programs,
spreadsheets, and the Internet to facilitate mathematics investigations and
communication about mathematics investigations.

**Course Description** :

This course will concentrate on using various software applications to solve
mathematics problems, to organize pedagogical demonstrations, and to set up
problem explorations. All materials for the course are maintained by an
Internet Web page site and students will create and use web documents in the
course.

The emphasis is on exploration of various mathematics contexts to learn
mathematics, to pose problems and problem extensions, to solve problems, and
to communicate mathematical demonstrations.

The following technologies will be used:

> Hand Held Calculators such as TI-81, TI-82, or TI-83  
>  Graphing Calculator 3.0 (from
**[http://www.pacifict.com](http://www.pacifict.com/)** )  
>  Geometers SketchPad (from
**[http://www.keypress.com](http://www.keypress.com/)** )  
>  Spreadsheets (recommend Excel)  
>  Web Page Browser (recommend Netscape 4.76)  
>  Web Page Authoring Tool (recommend Netscape 4.76)  
>  Time on computers -- in the workshop and at home or school

You can not expect to accomplish what you should from this course without time
on the computers that is in addition to the time we have in class. The usual
expectation of 2 hours study outside of class for every hour in class is
probably a minimum.

**Course Assignments** :

> There is no textbook. All assignments will be given and turned in via the
Web. We will have access to and learn to use various network tools.

**Grades and Requirements** :

>  
>  Grading is a necessary part of what we do and it is my intention to base
grades on performance in meeting the requirements of the course. This
performance includes the following:

>

>> 1.Attendance  
>  2.Participation

>>

>>>   * on the computer

>>>   * working with others

>>>   * class discussions

>>>   * investigations

>>

>> 3.Write-ups  
>  4.Lessons

A.There will be 13 Assignments, each corresponding with a different unit on
the InterMath Web site. There will be a "Write-up" for each assignment.

B.Each person will develop a personal Web Page for the course.

C.There will be a set of "Write-up" projects. These are the "homework" for the
course. Each Write-up will be prepared as an HTML document (i.e. a Web Page
document) and linked to your personal web page.

D.The Lessons are the follow-on part of the course. They will be a part of
your personal web site but eventually will be placed or linked to a library of
lessons available to all InterMath participants. Some examples (not
necessarily all "good" examples) are found at " **[Sample Instructional
Units](http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu/EMT669/units.html)** " on my web site.

E.What is a WRITE-UP?

> The "write-ups" represent your synthesis and presentation of a mathematics
investigation you have done --usually under the direction of one of the
assignments. The major point is that it convincingly communicates what you
have found to be important from the investigation. A write-up should
communicate the essential material you have synthesized from your
investigation. The format could be entirely in a word-processing document.
After all, an HTML document is basically a word processing document with
links. The HTML format, however, can combine narrative, pictures, and program
applications in a dynamic document. Write-ups should be posted to your
personal Web Page. If you work as a team on a write-up, post the write-up into
each team member's Web Page but label collaborative effort. Criteria should
include correct mathematics, use of technology, and how well you commuicate.
"Solution" might be another word for "Write-up."

F. Lessons

> The "lessons" are to be your creations of material to incorporate technology
into classroom lessons. The material can be individual lessons or a unit of
material. Your criteria should be on its usability in your classroom or in
other peoples classroom and something you feel good enough about to share with
colleagues over the web.

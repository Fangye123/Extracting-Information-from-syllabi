#### Course Objectives

After completing this course, you should be able to critically examine claims
made about human behavior--whether these claims are made by talk-show
"experts," journalists, or behavioral scientists. More specifically, after
completing this course, you should be able to:

  * Explain why psychology is a science in a manner that would convince both an average person and a physics major.

  * Evaluate research on the basis of its construct validity, internal validity, external validity, statistical validity, and conformity to APA's ethical principles. 

  * Conduct a literature review on a topic in psychology. 

  * Design, conduct, and analyze the results of a survey.

  * Design and analyze the results of factorial experiments.

  * Write a research proposal that conforms to APA style and format.

#### Grading

Much of the grade in this course is based on your performance on objective
exams (seven 10-point quizzes, one 80-point exam, two 100-point exams, and the
200-point final exam).

In addition to these objective items, your grade will be based on my
evaluation of two  projects:  the  field experiment, and the research proposal
\--100 points each), and your performance on lab and class assignments (70
points).

Approximate cut-offs for each grade are

90-100% A

80-89% B

70-79% C

60-69% D

0- 59% E

The course requires at least as much work as a four-credit course (remember,
this is a four-credit course, not a three-credit course). The workload is
heavy, but you are often allowed to correct your mistakes.

Note that each time you miss lab or fail to complete an assignment, you will
be docked one letter grade.

#### Overview of Projects

There are two main projects:

The Field Experiment Project

The Research Proposal

Along the way, there will be additional, smaller projects (library search
tasks, APA style assignments, etc.) that should help you in accomplishing
these larger projects.

#### Obtaining/Reporting Materials

Your text is all you really need. However, we will take advantage of the
Internet and a variety of computerized instructional materials. Thus, you will
be able to use the Web to view documents and to download tutorials.

###  Assignments, Exams, Homework, Quizzes

#### Field Experiment

You are expected to help design, conduct, and analyze the field experiment.
Failure to do so will result in reducing your final grade by an entire letter
grade.  
In addition, you are to write up an **APA style** report of the experiment.  
**This write-up must be your own work.**  
Copying from other people will be considered a serious violation. How serious?
Penalties may include flunking the course and expulsion from the university.  
The report must include a title page, a method section, a results section, and
a reference section. The report does **_not_** need to have an abstract,
introduction, or discussion section.  
Important note about the reference section: The reference section will
probably include only one reference, a reference to the White article that we
used as a model for this study. The key is to put the reference in APA style.
It seems easy, but, in the past, very few students have been able to do it
correctly. For example, it is not unusual for students to get 3 out of 10
points on the reference section.  

**Purposes:**

  1. To show that you know APA style.   
Knowing APA style is a goal of this course and will be important for your next
two write-ups (the scale project and the research proposal). You will also be
expected to write papers in APA style for other psychology courses at Clarion.
Even if you do not go on to graduate school, the ability to write a report
that looks professional and does not waste words (two hallmarks of APA style)
should serve you well.

  2. To develop a better understanding of how articles are organized.   
Once you understand what should be included in each section of the paper, you
should have an easier time understanding articles that you read.

  3. To show that you can apply some of the knowledge from Chapter 6 to this study.   
So please, do **not** confuse an independent variable for a dependent
variable, random assignment with random sampling (if you're not sure about the
distinction, try this [ tutorial](http://www.randomizer.org)), control group
with experimental group, or the value of "t" with the "p" level. Finally, do
not misinterpret null results (review Table 6-2).

**Length:** It should be about 4 pages long, although a paper with a perfect
score could be as short as 3 pages or as long as 6 pages. I suspect that most
papers will be 5 to 6 pages long.  

**Helpful Hints:**

  1. Since you will be **graded primarily on conforming to APA style** , you should consult the Chapter 14 tutorial. In addition, I would suggest looking at the sample paper (Appendix D), as well as reading Chapter 14 (at the very least, use the checklist at the end of Chapter 14). 
  2. The instructions the protocol team had you copy down may be useful in writing the method section. Also, in writing the procedure section, discuss what happened to participants. Don't talk about procedures you followed ("as a group, we calculated a mean") that have nothing to do with what participants experienced. After reading the procedure section, the reader should know how the participants were treated. 

**Due Date:** The write-up is due November 6.

#### Research Proposal

For this project, you will **NOT** conduct a study. Instead, you will write a
proposal. Ideally, this proposal is for work you **might** carry out next
semester with a faculty adviser--but that is up to you and the faculty member.  
The proposal **must** be for a study that uses a factorial design (see chapter
8) and at least one of your factors must be a "true" independent variable.
More specifically, you **must randomly assign** individuals to different
levels of that variable.  
In addition, you **must hypothesize an interaction**. Put another way, one of
the variables in your design should be a moderator variable (see Chapter 2).
Put yet another way, you will have at three hypotheses to discuss (one for
each main effect and one for the interaction).  
**You are strongly encouraged to meet with me individually to discuss your
research idea.**  
Your introduction should begin with a justificiation of why your research is
important (see Chapter 14). For example, you are encouraged to explain how
your research expands on previous research. **Do not forget to cite relevant
research and to cite studies that back up the claims you make**. The
introduction must end with your predictions for the main effects and the
interaction, a justification for each of your predictions, and a reference to
a graph that pictures your predicted effects.  
Your results section should simply describe how you plan to analyze your data.
That is, how you will get a score for each participant and what statistical
test you will use to analyze your data. Often, this section will only be two
sentences long.  
The discussion should start  "If the results are as predicted," and then go on
to review your predictions for the two main effects and the interaction. The
latter part of the introduction should emphasize future research that could be
done and implications of the research.  
Proposals that strictly adhere to APA format (see checklist in Chapter 14),
seem to be well thought out, and make a convincing case for the value of doing
the research will get high grades.  
The paper must contain abstract, introduction, method, results, discussion,
and reference sections, as well as a title page.  
**Length:** The paper should be between 7-10 pages long. The introduction
should be at least one and half pages long and the discussion should be at
least a page long.  
**Due Date:** The proposal is due by the beginning of class on December 13.

  2. Turn in a one-page, typed set of instructions that White might have given his researchers. To develop those intstructions, read the "General Method" section, as well as the other Method sections. Your instructions would include detailed advice about: 
    1. Who to approach 
    2. What the researcher should say when approaching a participant 
    3. How to deal with questions 
    4. What to say to the participant at the end of the interaction

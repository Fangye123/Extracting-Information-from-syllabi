**Make-Up Exam Policy:** Please mark your calendar immediately with exam dates

supporting documentation to the Office of Distance Learning Student Support in

the scheduled exam. Generally, make-up exams are essay in format so it is
highly recommended that you arrange to take your exam at the scheduled time
indicated in the syllabus.  
  
**Reviews:** Two review lectures will be given. Reviews will be designed to

self-addressed stamped envelope to the office of Student Support, or mail it
to:

4202 E. Fowler Ave.  
Tampa, FL 33620.  
Please include your name, your SSN, and which course(s) you are enrolled in.  

**Note:** A great deal of controversy has been made about the teaching of
traditional Western philosophies and histories during the last 20 years or so.
Feminists and other groups have documented the fallacies and misconceptions of
this approach to history. I urge you to thoroughly enjoy and enrich yourselves
with the information given in this course, but at the same time I encourage
you to look and read other histories outside the boundaries of the traditional
Western paradigm.

**The following essay is paraphrased and taken from the preface to
_HomoAestheticus, Where Art Comes From and Why_ by Ellen Dissanayake.**  
    One of the most striking features of human societies throughout history and across the globe is a prodigious involvement with the arts. Even nomadic people who own few material possessions usually decorate what they do own; embellish them, use elaborate poetic language for special occasions; and make music, sing, and dance. All known societies practice at least one of what we in the West call "the arts," and for many groups engaging with the arts ranks among their society's most important endeavors. This universality of making and enjoying art immediately suggests that an important appetite or need is being expressed.   
    General readers, not familiar with the arcane discourses of today's art world, may not be aware of the recent changes in consciousness that go by the general label of "postmodernism." In the larger society, "modernist" art (what used to be called "modern art"\- everything from the works of French impressionists to the stuff that is not immediately recognizable as art and what most people would dismiss as something one's child could make just as well) has scarcely been assimilated. Indeed, even the art of the Old Masters remains unfamiliar and foreign to the great mass of society.  Thus the squabbles of a bunch of artists and intellectuals may seem to be of little consequence.  
    These arguments encapsulate, however, a larger debate that is occurring in late twentieth century America, the debate between those who wish to preserve the two thousand year old heritage of Western, Greco-Roman, Judeo-Christian civilization and those who consider this heritage to be seriously inadequate. A growing movement criticizes the traditional Western interpretation of art and culture, with its Eurocentric bias, for its neglect or outright oppression of non-Western cultures (who are increasingly visible and vocal in multicultural society) and of women.   
    Defenders of Western civilization rightly fear that its very preservation and future at stake, and wonder what a society that does not esteem symphonies, museums, and the wisdom of "the Great Books" could possibly offer in their place. No wonder that some of the most conservative defenders of the status quo overreact and attempt to stifle all but the most innocuous and familiar forms and themes.   
    Looking at the arts today we find a confused state of affairs. The buying and selling of artworks is a billion-dollar business and thousands of people throng to major art exhibitions, however the arts remain more perplexing than insightful to the majority of those people. Some believe it is rare, valuable made by geniuses and sanctified by its presence at museums. Some others insist that it is a kind of pretentious folderol that most people quite obviously manage to live without. Still others believe art to be something that should disturb, challenge, provoke, and ultimately challenge people to liberate themselves from stagnant tradition. Contemporary philosophers of art admit that they cannot define their subject anymore. "We entered a period of art so absolute in its freedom that art seems but a name for an infinite play with its own concept." (Arthur Daunt 1986.)  
    The establishment may be hyper defensive because it is not easy to justify the relevance of art in a society where it costs so much, and where art competes with educational, health, and environmental claims on finite funds.   
    Because of the grand, somewhat forbidding garments that art has accumulated over the centuries, it is difficult, when asked what is art that it should take priority over hospitals, and schools, to discern if there is anything really there, or if so what the naked creature underneath might really be. Many practitioners of arts are united in their dissatisfaction with the "high art" view. Upon critical and careful examination we have discovered that what has been orthodox, and established as sacred has often masked repression and narrow-minded elitism.  Postmodern thought has opened a door to a new consideration of the place that art has had or might have in human life.   
    Still, despite this fresh air, it must be acknowledged that many have found sustenance and even transcendence in their experiences of the fine arts and have good reasons to remain convinced that these sources and occasions are real and valuable. Repudiation of the whole Western civilization is a harsh and rash response to admitted social inequities, so that post modernist remedies that recommend flushing the baby away with bath water can well seem even more misguided than malady.  
    Over the past century a distancing between people and art has occurred. To earlier generations art was a divine and mysterious visitation. Today it becomes further and further detached. Yet acquaintance with the arts at other times and places reminds us that they have been overwhelmingly integral to people's lives.  
    Even when we are told that "beauty" and "meaning" are socially constructed and relative terms insofar as they have been used by the elite to exclude or belittle others, most of us still yearn for them.   
    It is the theory of some that art would be viewed as an evolution of human behavior that is natural and intrinsic and that it is fundamental to humankind.   
    Artist and art teachers may find a biological justification for the intrinsic importance of their vocation quite welcome and everyone, particularly those who feel a loss or absence of beauty, form, meaning, value, and quality in modern life, sho

**Description:**

This course aims to provide students with a working knowledge of the religion
and civilization of Islam. This will include a look at Islam as a religion, as
well as the culture, civilization and institutions that resulted from the
synthesis between Islam and the intellectual, cultural, spiritual and other
expressions and aspirations of the various Muslim peoples. In addition to
indentifying the core beliefs, practices and sentiments that defined the
Muslim Community, we will look at those issues that came to form the focal
point of ongoing debate and disagreement, which produced "tendencies" and
"orientations," interaction among which resulted in the tensions (sometimes
dynamic, at other times less so) that defined Muslim history. We will visit a
number of the "major" communities (commonly considered to be part of the
Middle East) in their historical encounter with Islam. We will also look at a
number of Muslim communities in other parts of the world, including places
where Muslims are a minority. We will end with a discussion between Islam and
modernity and Islam in the West (specifically in the U.S.).

**Text:** The main text for this course will be J. Esposito, _Islam: The
Straight Path_ , Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988 (1st edition), along
with a coursepack, available at Accucopy.

**Grading:**

Grading will be based on student participation in class (10%), performance on
the midterm exam (25%), final exam (35%) and the final term paper (30%). The
final term paper is to be approximately 10 double-spaced, typewritten pages.
It must clearly reflect each student's independent RESEARCH on a topic of his
or her choice. In choosing a topic, students should conduct a preliminary
investigation into the availability of _quality_ sources in languages in which
they are proficient.

**Internet sources:** Student who wish to use the internet should do so
responsibly. Just as with any book, the fact that a statement appears in print
neither guarantees its validity nor insulates the student from possible
criticism. One should be particularly careful about web-sites that are
inordinately biased one way or another. All internet sources used in the term
paper must be fully downloaded (such that the source is clearly indicated) and
submitted along with the term paper. _Failure to do so will adversely affect
grading._

**Due Date:** The term paper will be due on Thursday, 13 April. No late papers
will be accepted unless the student submits a written request explaining his
or her need for an extension. One copy of this letter should be addressed to
Prof. Sherman Jackson and another to the chair of the Near Eastern Studies
Department, Prof. Alexander Knysh. It will be responded to within 48 hours or
the next class meeting, whichever comes first. _The submission of a request
for an extension is not a guarantee that one will be granted._

**Statement of Academic Integrity:** It is assumed that the final term paper
represents the unassisted effort of each individual student. Any and all
instances of plagrism will fetch an automatic F. If you have any question
about the propriety of any form of collaboration with anyone, please consult
Prof. Jackson _in advance_.

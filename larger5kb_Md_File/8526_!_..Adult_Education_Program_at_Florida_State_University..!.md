OBJECTIVE

The central objective of this course is to explore differences and
similarities among the strategies and programs of adult education that have
been developed in different countries around the world - and to discover what
can be learned from the comparison.

METHODS

To accomplish this purpose, we will begin by considering the method of
comparison itself and its uses in education. What do we get from comparing the
approaches to organizing and facilitating adult learning that are
characteristic of different social systems and cultures, and how can we do it
most effectively?

We will then exercise and develop our comparative and inquiry skills by
examining adult education practice in different cultures from five points of
view:

  1. assumptions and practices regarding _adult learning and development;_
  2. patterns of _provision and participation_ ;
  3. uses of _educational technology;_
  4. adult education _policy and finance_ ; and, finally,
  5. the nature of _professional organization_.

READING

Our basic text for the course is Albert Tuijnman, (Ed.) International
Encyclopedia of Adult Education and Training, second edition, New York:
Pergamon Press. 1996. Class members are welcome to buy the text (and can do so
by arrangement with the instructor); but, as it is quite voluminous and
expensive, you may also choose to receive photocopies of the specific articles
that we will be reading and simply pay for those. A certain number of
additional photocopied readings on particular programs and experiences in
adult education will likewise be furnished, and a supplemental set of works
will be placed on reserve.

Expectations of students in this course are the following:

  1. Regular class attendance and active participation in discussions and assignments
  2. Preparation of five "comparative cameos" - one for each section of the course, discussed below.
  3. Completion of a take-home examination at the end of the course.

"COMPARATIVE CAMEOS"

In each of the five sections of the course we will be doing a comparative
exercise, which will involve class members individually selecting two case
illustrations of the topic under consideration to compare with each other and
to draw lessons from. In the Policy and Finance section of the course, for
example, this could entail comparing systems for funding adult education in
Sweden and the United States, or comparing lifelong learning policies in Japan
with those in France. In the Adult Development and Learning section, you might
decide to compare attitudes toward aging and learning in Indian culture with
those in Latin America.

Materials for the comparison will be derived from our required readings and
from supplemental materials that will be made available or that you can easily
locate in the Curriculum Resource Center, Strozier Library or on internet.
Each paper must be no more than 4 pages long, inclusive of references.

TAKE HOME EXAMINATION

The final examination will be a take-home exercise designed to assist you in
drawing together some of the main lessons and insights you have obtained from
the course. You will NOT be expected to do any new reading or library research
for it, but simply to draw on the material you have already read and the notes
taken in class. It will also be designed to be completed in four hours of
time.

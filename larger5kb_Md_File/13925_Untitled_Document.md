course of the semester.

**Course Description**

This course explores processes of environmental change, examining them in
their proper ecological, geographical, and historical contexts. The course
also addresses the multi-faceted relationship between human beings and their
surroundings as well as changing definitions of environment and nature.
Geographically the course will focus on the area of the present United States
from pre-history through the present. The semester will begin with an
assessment of landscape, then will move on to address the ways that different
human cultures have used and interacted with that landscape through 15,000
years, beginning with American Indians and then focusing on European
settlement and occupation of the continent. Major themes will include changing
ways of using the land, changing attitudes toward nature and wilderness, and
the evolution of environmental politics in the U.S. Students learn in
different ways, and this course will offer several means of assimilating
information: lectures, discussions, reading, writing, and field trips. Each
period lasts 75 minutes. Most class sessions combine lecture and discussion.

**Course Objectives**

The first objective is to introduce students to the important topics and
themes of American environmental history. By the end of the semester students
will know a basic story of how Americans have interacted with the natural
world. The second aim is to develop academic skills in critical reading,
critical thinking, and analytical writing. The instructor expects to educate
students in American environmental history through assignments that will
strengthen reading, writing, and analytical skills.

**Communication**

I would like to be as accessible to you as possible. I will hold open office
hours, on a first come, first served basis, three hours per week (Tuesdays and
Thursdays, 3:00 to 4:30) in my office in ST 203D. In addition, I will be happy
to make appointments at any time we can both agree on. Please visit me to talk
about any aspect of the course. I use email daily during the week, but rarely
on weekends. Send me a message (cunfer@southwest.msus.edu) and I will happily
reply. Please do not call me at home.  
  
**Grades**

Final grades will be based on the following assignments:

Pre-exam 5%  
Attendance 10%  
Outside-class activities 15%  
Pop quizzes 10%  
Midterm exam 15%  
Local environmental history paper 25%  
Final exam 20%

**Attendance** The instructor will keep roll throughout the semester.
Attendance at all class meetings is required. Over the semester students may
miss two class meetings without penalty. After that the attendance grade will
drop by 10% for each additional missed class, regardless of reason. No
explanations or excuses are needed for missed classes, but the above procedure
is firm.

**Pop Quizzes** Students should always bring this syllabus and the currently
assigned books to class. From time to time throughout the semester class will
begin with a brief pop quiz over details of the current reading assignment or
of the syllabus. Students will be free to consult their syllabus and books,
but may not share them with others.

**Outside-class activities** Over the course of the semester students will be
required to attend three outside-of-class activities related to environmental
history and to write one paragraph summaries of them. Most of these activities
will focus around the Regional Water Conference to be held at SSU on March 21
and 22. Students should reserve as much time as possible on those two days to
attend sessions of the conference. There also may be other occasions during
the semester when the instructor will announce relevant activities that will
fulfill this requirement.

**Classroom Courtesy**

I promise to treat students with respect. I will work hard to arrive on time,
to be well-prepared for class, to return graded assignments promptly, and to
treat each of you as intelligent, feeling human beings. I expect the same from
you. Please do not come to class late. In class, I ask that you refrain from
sleeping, reading the newspaper, eating, talking except when appropriate, or
otherwise distracting the class. Pagers and cellular telephones are not
allowed, and if one rings I will ask you to remove it from the room.

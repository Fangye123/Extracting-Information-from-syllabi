**Primary Sources for Historians**

  * Paul Halsall has created a series of Internet Sourcebooks that reproduce out-of-copyright primary texts for use in teaching. They are a _terrific_ resource. Halsall began this project with the [Internet Medieval Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html) and has followed up with the [Modern History Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html).  This is a goldmine!  Hundreds of sources in areas such as the Early Modern World, Scientific and Industrial Revolutions, Latin America, the Middle East, the World Since 1945....and the list goes on!  To top it all off, there are links to African, East Asian, Indian, Islamic, Jewish, LGBT, and Women sourcebooks.  Check this one out! 
  * [Women and Social Movements in the United States, 1830-1930](http://womhist.binghamton.edu), directed by Kathryn Kish Sklar and Thomas Dublin, consists of sets of selected primary documents focusing on specific questions related to women and social movements in the United States between 1830 and 1930. 
**History on the Web**

  * [American Museum of Radio](http://www.antique-radio.org/sounds/index.htm): Sounds from the history of radio broadcasting, including original shows from the golden era of radio, advertising, and broadcasts of historical events such as FDRs "Declaration of War" and Eddie Cantor's musings on the Stock Market crash. 
  * [The Sixties Project:](http://lists.village.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Sixties.html) Primary and secondary sources from America in the 1960s, including manifestos from SNCC, SDS, and the Black Panther party.
  * [Clash of Cultures](http://www.history.ohio-state.edu/projects/clash/).  America in the 1910s and 1920s, with tips on how to teach the topics of nativism, prohibition, and the New Women, among others.
  * The following four sites are associated in various ways with The Center for History and New Media ( <http://chnm.gmu.edu>) at George Mason University:  


    1. Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution ( <http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/>), a new site launched in August 2001, provides an accessible and lively introduction to the French Revolution as well as an extraordinary archive of some of the most important documentary evidence from the Revolution. Ten overview essays cover the major topics in the history of the revolution, including, the social causes of the Revolution, the fall of the monarchy, women and the Revolution, the story of Napoleon, and the legacies of the Revolution. Two additional essays consider "How to Read an Image" and "Songs of the Revolution." The site also provides a rich collection of documentary evidence, including 338 texts, 245 images, and a number of maps and songs. Lynn Hunt of UCLA and Jack Censer of GMU served as principal authors and editors. The site is a collaboration of the Center for History and New Media (CHNM) and the American Social History Project at the City University of New York (ASHP; <http://www.ashp.cuny.edu/>), supported by grants from the Florence Gould Foundation and the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH).  


    2. History Matters: The U.S. Survey Course on the Web ( <http://historymatters.gmu.edu>): Designed especially for teachers of U.S. History Survey courses, History Matters provides an excellent starting point for exploring American history on the Web. WWW.history serves as a gateway to the Internet, providing an annotated, searchable guide to more than 500 high quality web sites as well scholarly reviews of sites (published in collaboration with the Journal of American History). The site also offers unique teaching materials, such as Many Pasts, a feature containing close to 600 first-person primary documents about the experiences of "ordinary" Americans in text, image, and audio. Talking History, a series of online discussion forums, offers teachers the opportunity to engage with leading scholars on key subjects in the U.S. Survey. Fall 2001 forums include Reconstruction with Eric Foner and Internationalizing U.S. History with Thomas Bender. Additional teaching resources include Digital Blackboard (model teaching exercises using Web resources), Syllabus Central (annotated syllabi offering creative approaches to teaching), and Students as Historians (examples of student work on the Web). Past Meets Present provides essays that place such current issues as capital punishment and gun control in a historical context. Secrets of Great History Teachers offers online interviews in which distinguished teachers share their teaching strategies. History Matters was produced by CHNM and ASHP with support from NEH and the Kellogg Foundation.  


    3. History Departments around the World: CHNM offers a comprehensive and searchable database of almost 1,200 History Departments around the World. The database is an excellent resource if you are looking for the email addresses of other historians. Many department Web pages also include detailed biographical information on their entire faculty as well as information on their programs and requirements. A quick search is available at: <http://chnm.gmu.edu/> A more detailed search page can be found at: <http://history.gmu.edu/chnm/departments.php>  


    4. ECHO: Exploring and Collecting History Online--Science & Technology ( <http://chnm.gmu.edu/echo/>) is designed to promote and improve the history of science and technology on the Web. Funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, ECHO will accomplish this in several ways: through a directory that has collected, categorized, and begun to annotate more than 2,600 sites on the history of science and technology; by consulting with and assisting other historians who wish to explore the unique ways the Internet can aid and expand their work; through free, easy-to-use Web-based software tools like the ECHO Survey Builder that allow historians to collect history online without advanced computer skills; and through outreach to those who took part in and experienced the scientific and technological advances of the twentieth century, leading to a vibrant electronic archive of first-hand accounts.

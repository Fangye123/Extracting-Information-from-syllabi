#### Prerequisites

HCI 440 and HCI 430. The HCI 430 prerequisite may be waived if the student has
programming experience.

#### Overview

This course teaches the concepts and practices of user-centered design in the
development of interactive Web pages. Students will learn enough technical Web
programming, including HTML and Javascript, to develop client-side prototypes.
Projects include developing and testing interactive prototypes of Web sites.

#### Goals

  * Learn how to apply principles of user-centered design (UCD) to Web development. 
  * Learn client-side programming in order to develop testable interactive prototypes of Web sites.
  * Acquire an overall understanding of Web technology.

#### Projects

  1. Four individual Web assignments using HTML and JavaScript
  2. User and task analysis for proposed Web site
  3. Conceptual design
  4. Horizontal and vertical prototyping
  5. Full prototyping

#### Grade Determination

20% (40 points)  | Individual assignments (10 points each)  
---|---  
20% (40 points)  | Group Projects (10 points each)  
20% (40 points)  | Group Report  
30% (60 points) |  Quiz (20 points) and Test (40 points)  
10% (20 points) |  Group participation  
  
Students receiving more than 90% of possible points are guaranteed at least an
A-, more than 80% at least a B-, more than 70% at least a C-, and more than
60% at least a D.

#### Policies

While attendance does not comprise a formal part of the grade, students are
expected to attend all classes and participate in in-class exercises. Class
will start promptly at 5:45. Students are individually responsible for
material they may have missed due to absence or tardiness. Furthermore, since
some group work will occur during class, a student who misses class will
jeopardize their standing with the group.

All group projects will be completed in groups of three or four. While
students will have some control on group selection, the instructor reserves
the right to modify groups in order to meet course objectives. While the group
may assign a primary role to each group member, all group members are jointly
responsible for the entire assignment. Generally, each group member will
receive the same grade. However, in some cases, additional credit may go to
those who make an exceptional contribution to a project and reduced credit to
those who contribute little to a project. Such adjustment of credit would be
made in addition to the grade awarded for group participation.

Quizzes and tests can only be made up with a serious documented excuse (e.g.
illness, death in the family). A make-up quiz or test must be arranged as soon
as possible and always before the student attends the next class meeting.
Arrangements involving other excuses require prior permission from the
instructor.

Late projects will be accepted without penalty until 2pm the day following the
due date. Projects turned in later than 2pm the day following the due date
will not be accepted. For projects requiring a working prototype, the working
prototype must always be ready for testing by classtime.

Assignments submitted by email are generally not accepted.

#### University Policies

**Plagiarism:** The university and school policy on plagiarism can be
summarized as follows: Students in this course, as well as all other courses
in which independent research or writing play a vital part in the course
requirements, should be aware of the strong sanctions that can be imposed
against someone guilty of plagiarism. If proven, a charge of plagiarism could
result in an automatic F in the course and possible expulsion. The strongest
of sanctions will be imposed on anyone who submits as his/her own work a
report, examination paper, computer file, lab report, or other assignment
which has been prepared by someone else. If you have any questions or doubts
about what plagiarism entails or how to properly acknowledge source materials
be sure to consult the instructor.

**Incomplete:** An incomplete grade is given only for an exceptional reason
such as a death in the family, a serious illness, etc. Any such reason must be
documented. Any incomplete request must be made at least two weeks before the
final, and approved by the Dean of the School of Computer Science,
Telecommunications and Information Systems. Any consequences resulting from a
poor grade for the course will not be considered as valid reasons for such a
request.

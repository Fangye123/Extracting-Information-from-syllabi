A lawyer without history and literature is a mechanic, a mere working mason;
if he possess some knowledge of these, he may venture to call himself an
architect.  
          \-- Sir Walter Scott, _[Guy Mannering](http://www.bartleby.com/304/)_ (1815; New York: E. P. Dutton  & Co., 1906), 259.  

The _Laws_ of a country are necessarily connected with every thing belonging
to the people of it; so that a thorough knowledge of _them,_ and of their
progress, would inform us of every thing that was most useful to be known
about them; and one of the greatest imperfections of historians in general, is
owing to their ignorance of law.  
          \-- [Joseph Priestley](http://www.woodrow.org/teachers/chemistry/institutes/1992/Priestley.html), _Lectures on History_ (Birmingham: Pearson and Rollason, 1788), 149.  

The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience. The seed of
every new growth within its sphere has been a felt necessity. The form of
continuity has been kept up by reasonings purporting to reduce everything to a
logical sequence; but that form is nothing but the evening dress which the
new-comer puts on to make itself presentable according to conventional
requirements. The important phenomenon is the man underneath it, not the coat;
the justice and reasonableness of a decision, not its consistency with
previously held views. No one will every have a truly philosophic mastery over
the law who does not habitually consider the forces outside of it which have
made it what it is....  
          \-- [ Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.](http://search.biography.com/print_record.pl?id=15942), review _of A Selection of Cases on the Law of Contracts. . ._ , 2d ed.,   
             by Christoper C. Langdell, _American Law Review_ 14 (1880): 233.

**T** his course concerns itself with the interaction between the legal system
and social change in what is now the United States. Chronologically, the
course materials run from the colonial period to the New Deal, although the
nineteenth century will receive particular emphasis. A principal focus is the
interrelationship of law, social life, economy, and ideology.

 **WARNING** :  Like all law school courses, this course contains material
that some students may find offensive.  For example, the readings for this
course document instances of fornication, transvestism/hermaphrodism, and
bestiality, as well as murder and other violence.  This course is an elective,
and any student likely to be upset by this material should consider dropping
the course.

The [assignments](docs/assign.html) indicate the topics into which the course
will divide. These topics include colonial regulation of economy, morality and
labor; slavery and racism in seventeenth-century Virginia; the Revolution; the
Constitution; the legal profession; public lands; native peoples; property law
in the early nineteenth century; corporations; women and family; morality and
social welfare; criminal justice; antebellum slavery; reconstruction; late-
nineteenth-century populism and industrialism; legal education; legal realism;
and the New Deal.

The course consists of 27 lectures of 75 minutes apiece.  During the lectures,
students should feel free to raise questions and initiate discussion as may be
appropriate.  Participation in class discussion is on a voluntary basis.

Prior familiarity with U.S. history is not necessary.  The lectures and
reading will provide whatever extralegal background may be essential, and
students should feel free to raise questions in or outside class.

          Course Objectives


Our primary focus in this interdisciplinary legal studies course is the 
        persistence in the United States of inequality based on class, race, and 
        gender. We examine the legal system from a critical perspective, incorporating 
        material from law, history, sociology, and other disciplines. This is 
        not a "how to do it" technical course. Instead, Law and Inequality 
        is designed to increase your ability to critically analyze issues related 
        to inequality and to present your views clearly, logically, and systematically, 
        supporting your conclusions through reasoned analysis.
Much of the material we will read and discuss is controversial. It is 
        designed to present empirical evidence and value-based arguments that 
        challenge our ordinary views of American law and society. What is the 
        nature and extent of inequality in the United States today? How and why 
        has the legal system historically favored the rich and discriminated against 
        poor and working people, racial minorities, and women? To what extent 
        can the legal system be used to achieve social change? And--an increasingly 
        important question today--why do so many people insist that inequality 
        is no longer a problem?
Make sure you understand the requirements in this syllabus and in related 
        handouts. The class format, requirements, topics, and grading system are 
        somewhat flexible. Suggestions, comments, and general discussion about 
        the course or other matters are welcome during my office hours or at other 
        times.

General Expectations and Class Participation


Class discussion is the heart of this course, both in small groups 
        and in the larger class. You should come to class prepared to ask questions 
        about what you have read, to evaluate the material, and to express your 
        own reasoned views on controversial issues. Your participation should 
        demonstrate that you have carefully read the material and thought about 
        its implications.
Many of the controversial value questions we discuss have no "right" 
        or "wrong" answers. The personal views you express in class or in papers 
        do not affect your grades, so please feel free to say what you 
        really think and to disagree with the books, with me, and with other students. 
        However: it is important to support your views thoughtfully, demonstrating 
        an understanding of the issues. Rather than simply dismissing viewpoints 
        that conflict with your own, you should evaluate such viewpoints and analyze 
        the issues they raise. Listen to what others have to say and try to 
        understand their perspective.
General class participation counts 15% of your grade. If you find 
        it difficult to get a word in or if you are not used to participating, 
        talk to the instructor. Perhaps we can structure things so that you're 
        more comfortable. If you tend to dominate discussions, please give others 
        a chance. Although participation is important, quantity is less important 
        than quality.
You cannot participate if you are not in class. Regular attendance 
        is required to enable productive discussions. Repeated absence 
        results in a lower grade for participation. Frequent absence results 
        in a failing grade for the course. Regular attendance with minimal participation 
        in discussion receives a C for participation. You are responsible for 
        all material and schedule changes discussed in class.
College students generally are expected to work about two hours outside 
        class for every hour in class. Thus, you should plan to average eight 
        hours a week on outside assignments for this four-credit course.




Group Project


Each student will take part in a group project focused on economic 
        class and ideology; racism; and/or sexism. The project culminates in a 
        class presentation at the end of the semester. Your group has a 
        great deal of leeway in how to approach this. For example, you might produce 
        a written report identifying a problem and advocating a solution, or model 
        legislation, a broadcast-quality video, or an Internet World Wide Web 
        site. Your focus can be either national (e.g., "Racial Issues in the Presidential 
        Campaign") or local (e.g., "Sexism at UIS" or "The Consequences of Class 
        Differences in Springfield").
The class will be divided into three or four groups early in the semester. 
        Each group will decide how to approach its issue, taking into account 
        course readings, current events locally and nationally, and your own interests. 
        Each group will meet with me to finalize its plans. I expect you to meet 
        with your group outside class throughout the semester, do library and 
        other research, coordinate your work with others in your group, present 
        a clear position in class, and respond to questions and critiques raised 
        by others.
The group will provide occasional progress reports in class throughout 
        the semester. By September 30, each group will submit a 
        brief outline showing how you are organizing your work (what you 
        intend to do, who is responsible for what, etc.).
After your class presentation, each group member will complete 
        a Group Project Peer Evaluation Form to evaluate the work of the 
        other group members.
Each student in the class will complete a Presentation Evaluation 
        Form, evaluating the presentation as a whole.
The project counts 30% of the course grade. Half your grade 
        is based on your own work on the group project, and half on your group's 
        efforts as a whole: for example, were major topics covered, without obvious 
        gaps or excessive overlap? Was the outside research comprehensive? Did 
        group members succeed in working together? Was the presentation interesting?

If you do not have
        the time, interest, or patience
        to work outside class on a group project with other students,
        you should not take this course.





Papers


You will write three substantive papers throughout the semester. In addition 
        to the instructions here, follow the General Guidelines For 
        Papers handout for content and form.


Class Inequality and Sexism Papers
Write two brief papers (between 500 and 750 words) reacting to, and 
        analyzing, material in Rothenberg's text. Topics:

Class Inequality Due no later than September 30 (15%)
Sexism Due no later than November 25 (20%)

Clearly identify the reading(s) you are analyzing. The paper should 
        demonstrate or prove a main point explicitly indicated in your first 
        paragraph. Do not summarize the readings, merely express agreement 
        or disagreement, or comment superficially on a variety of topics. Instead, 
        develop a single theme as you analyze issues that relate 
        to the course, express and justify your own views, and explain why 
        alternative views are wrong.
For example, do not simply agree with an author that inequality is bad, 
        or say that people should teach children not to discriminate, or claim 
        that an author's article is either brilliant or ridiculous. Instead, pinpoint 
        the controversy; this often relates to the author's ideological perspective 
        on the underlying problem's origins and possible solutions.
The ideal paper is an analytical, persuasive, and personal discussion 
        of a single controversial point in the readings. I am not asking 
        you to be "objective"--I want to know what you think--but you do 
        have to be fair in presenting and analyzing alternative perspectives 
        as you reflect upon, and justify, your own. Make sure, also, that you 
        do not simply repeat comments made in class.
Although these papers are brief, they are not easy to do. They 
        typically require that you revise several drafts in order to narrow your 
        focus.


Racism/Affirmative Action Paper
Due October 28. 20% of course grade.
Write an essay (between 5 and 8 pages) in which you analyze the 
        issue of affirmative action as portrayed in George Curry's Affirmative 
        Action Debate. In assessing this book, you should also take into account 
        related material in Rothenberg, class discussion, and current news coverage 
        of race-related issues.
In terms of the paper's focus, follow the General Guidelines for Papers 
        and the instructions listed above for the Class Inequality and Sexism 
        papers--but assess the Curry book as a whole, not just a single reading 
        in it.




Graduate Students


Graduate students are expected to meet all regular requirements at a 
        graduate level of competence. In addition, graduate students must write 
        a research paper or complete an alternative project, which you should 
        discuss early in the semester with the instructor. Other course modifications 
        may be made as appropriate.




Self-Evaluation Paper


Your self-evaluation paper, due December 16, provides an opportunity 
        for you to assess your work in this course and to reflect on what you 
        have learned about the subject matter and about yourself. The typed paper 
        should be at least 500 words.
Evaluate your learning with respect to the course as a whole and each 
        course component: attendance, class participation, assigned reading, papers, 
        and group project. You should (a) reflect on what you have learned, critically 
        examining your strengths and weaknesses in each area using specific examples; 
        (b) give yourself a grade using the criteria described below; and (c) 
        explain the reasons for your grade. Although I will not grade the evaluation, 
        it is required. A thoughtful, thorough, honest self-evaluation can 
        make the difference in the case of borderline grades.




Grading


Teachers at UIS are required to assign grades. This is a difficult, frustrating, 
        and sometimes destructive task. I am glad to provide evaluative feedback 
        in the form of written comments and one-to-one conferences, but reducing 
        a subjective evaluation to a single letter is a gross oversimplification.
Grading fosters excessive competition at the expense of real learning, 
        and makes distinctions among you for the benefit of social institutions 
        over which you have little control. Although the significance of any single 
        grade is often minimal, I know that worrying is inevitable when your overall 
        GPA affects graduation honors, admission to postgraduate education, and 
        careers.
To reduce your anxiety, I strongly encourage you to take the course 
        on a Credit/No Credit basis. If you do so, instead of a grade your 
        transcript will indicate Credit (for undergraduates receiving at least 
        a C and for graduate students getting at least a B) or No Credit. Remember, 
        though, that in order to receive a C, all work must be completed in satisfactory 
        fashion, with regular attendance.
For those of you who want me to grade you instead, I take the task 
        seriously and try to avoid grade inflation. Grades on assignments 
        reflect my honest appraisal of your work so that you can assess your progress. 
        I use the grading system described in the UIS catalog, modified by pluses 
        and minuses:
A = Excellent B = Good C = Fair D = Marginal But Passing U = Unsatisfactory
Final course grades are based on the weighted average of all assignments, 
        though I may give less weight to a single grade that is much lower than 
        your others. Students who work hard to meet all course expectations, read 
        carefully, attend class and participate regularly, and routinely produce 
        good work normally receive a B.
If you have questions or concerns about your grades, please see 
        me.

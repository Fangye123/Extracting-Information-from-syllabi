Purpose of the Course


"Research Methods" is a required course for all students pursuing the 
     Master of Science in Education degree with a major in Workforce Education 
     and Development. The overall purpose of the course is to introduce basic 
     vocabulary, concepts, and methods of educational research. Students learn 
     the language of research, various methods for conducting research, how to 
     identify and synthesize research literature, how to plan a research study 
     that improves the practice of education or training, and how to formally 
     report research findings. The more specific purpose is for students to 
     develop a sample research proposal.
     Many students have misunderstandings about the nature of WED 561, one 
     result of which is taking the course in the last semester of their graduate 
     program. Then, if the paper isn't finished during the semester, students 
     may have to register for an additional semester. 
Students are encouraged to take the course during the first half of 
     their graduate program. One is not expected to have a research problem 
     identified before taking the course. Rather, part of the course instruction 
     is designed to assist students in the systematic identification of a 
     research topic. Students should also be aware that the development of a 
     research problem and proposal and the evolution of a research study is best 
     conducted over a period of several semesters rather than being concentrated 
     in a final, hectic semester. 

General Objectives




Understands basic concepts and definitions of educational 
          research. 
Selects a tentative research problem that will be subsequently 
          developed into a research proposal. 
Knows and uses library reference sources and services. 
Understands how to develop Chapter One of the research 
          paper/proposal. 
Understands how to develop Chapter Two of the research 
          paper/proposal 
Understands how to develop Chapter Three of the research 
          paper/proposal. 
Knows APA rules and guidelines related to writing formal research 
          reports. 
Understands how to develop Chapter Four of the research 
          paper/proposal. 
Understands how to develop Chapter Five of the research 
          paper/proposal. 


Instructional Units


Each general objective provides the focus for an instructional unit 
     containing multiple specific objectives and assignments designed to 
     facilitate the objectives. Beginning with Unit Four, in-class instruction 
     is directed toward the application of relevant concepts to the preparation 
     of a sample research proposal.
     One cannot expect to master the subject of educational research in a 
     single semester. And, the schedule format (evening, weekend, or summer) and 
     number of students enrolled affects what can be accomplished in a given 
     course. Students can anticipate completing the first seven units during the 
     course. Units Eight and Nine, however, are optional (*) and will be 
     instructed to the extent that time permits. Most students should expect to 
     enroll in WED 593 (or 599) and work with their program committee to 
     actually conduct and report the research (i.e., the focus of Units Eight 
     and Nine). 
New WED Department policies require students to purchase instructional 
     units. The instructor will provide details regarding cost and availability.

Assignments and Requirements




Complete instructional units and related exercises as directed. 
          Come to class prepared. Actively participate in discussion of relevant 
          topics. 
Complete hands-on "library use exercise" (Unit Three) as directed. 
          Assignment due on ____________________. 
Prepare a three chapter research proposal in accordance with 
          outline provided in Unit Two (approximately 15 typed pages). 
A draft of Chapter One is due on ____________________. 
The completed proposal is due on ____________________. 
Complete a final examination covering objectives, assignments, and 
          class lectures for Units One through Six 


Grading 

A conventional letter grade (A - F) will be assigned based on the 
     following criteria:
     

10% - Library exercise 
40% - Final exam 
50% - Research proposal 

The instructor will explain in class specific grading procedures and how 
     final grades are calculated. Test norms will be provided showing how 
     previous WED 561 students performed. 

Policies and Standards


The majority of students complete assignments satisfactorily and 
     on-time. Out of respect for the majority of students who meet deadlines, 
     one letter grade is deducted for any work turned in late. Attendance is 
     expected. It is recognized, however, that personal and professional needs 
     and responsibilities may sometimes require students to miss a class. 
     Preceding or following an absence, students should contact the instructor 
     to obtain handout materials. Students should also make arrangements with a 
     classmate to obtain notes. A third absence results in one letter grade 
     deduction. A fourth absence results in failure of the course. An INC grade 
     is not a student option; it is given only at the discretion of the 
     instructor.
     Informal attire is permitted, but please dress in a manner appropriate 
     for a university classroom, including removing hats or caps. Coffee and 
     other drinks may be consumed during class, but no food is to be eaten in 
     the classroom.

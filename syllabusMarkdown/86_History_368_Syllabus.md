  ![](Acrobats.jpg) | **W** e are all interested in gender relations and sex
in our own way. Each strikes at the sensitive core of our being. Few topics
generate heat and controversy so readily today. Decisions made in the first
centuries of the Christian era still haunt us. They affect all of us, whether
we acknowledge the faith that produced them or not -- atheists, non-believers
and even many non-westerners included.

**T** he history of western attempts to deal with the problem of marriage and
sexuality thus has a special claim to our attention. A glum tale of the
continuing influence of the dominant white male it does seem. Marriage is
society's main framework for the control \- some would say repression -- of
sexuality and reproduction, activities with a supreme power to explode into
violence and confusion. For the historian intent on a comprehensive view of a
culture, it offers quite as good a starting point as politics, one with its
own still fresh perspective. This is not a "professional" exposition of the
History of Sexuality, which has become a specialty of its own, but an
exposition of what is known, what is knowable, and how these findings affect
our overall understanding of the Medieval West.  | ![](Birdnet.jpg)

**T** his will be very much a **reading-and-discussion** course. Lectures will
review the readings in historical perspective and supplement them. Friday
discussions (in small groups) will usually take off from samples of original
source material, in English translation, intended to spur critical examination
of the readings. Students will certainly bring to the course a wide variety of
preoccupations and theoretical starting-points. They are encouraged to voice
their own thoughts and feelings about the issues uncovered, and to listen to
those of their companions.

**T** he period to be studied ranges from the first Christian centuries up to
the eve of the Reformation. We begin by clarifying in outline the process by
which the theologians and canon lawyers produced an ideal and a workable
definition of a binding Christian marriage. We then seek to explain the
character of the synthesis that emerged. Armed with the legal and theological
context of marriage, we can then proceed to some more specific topics, such as
homosexuality, rape/abduction, prostitution, bawd and literary attitudes
towards sexuality. Previous classes have found the material not just
fascinating but on occasion hugely enjoyable. The hope is to end up with some
idea of how the reality compared with the Church's "ideal" and, in some sense,
to assess the product that came forward to the Reformation, and to us, who
still suffer (?) under its legacy today.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

1\. **_Prelim Exam on the Legal Development of Christian Marriage_**. This
will be a take-home, consisting of short questions answerable from the
readings of Weeks I - V. [ **15 % of Final Grade** ]

2\. **_Dossier of relevant Biblical Texts_**. You will come across frequent
Bible citations in the readings. Make yourself a list of those you find
interesting in a file. You may use any Bible version that is available to you,
online versions included.

> The Bible most used in the period was some kind of Latin "Vulgate". Make me
explain.  The English-language _Douai Bible_ [Olin BS180. 1888], that follows
this closely, is in the Medieval Studies Reading Room, Olin 404, also at  <
**<http://www.cybercomm.net/~dcon/drbible.html>** >.

A copy of this preliminary list of citations will be due before leaving for
Spring Break. From it, you will select about 6 texts for brief (max. of 1 page
each) comment (eg on the different medieval readings and responses). This
dossier is to be submitted by the start of Week XIV ( **May 1** ). **[15 % of
Final Grade]**

3\. **_Chaucer as a source for attitudes on Marriage and Sexuality_**. Each
student will be assigned on a random basis **_one_** of a list of selected
Canterbury Tales, and should be prepared, if called on, to make a brief
presentation on his/her assigned Tale in Week XIII. It is **your own
responsibility** to acquire well in advance a text (e.g. a xerox) of this.
**[5% of Final Grade]**

4\. **_Term-Paper_**. This will be an upper-level research paper, say, 20+ pp.
long. See me in Office Hours to agree a title and discuss materials before
**Friday April 14**. The paper **must** be in by 5 p.m. **Monday, May 8** , at
the start of Study Week.  
**[60 % of Final Grade]**

5\. **_Readings & Class Participations_** [ **10% of Final Grade** ]. It is
especially important to make an early start on the reading, whose weight
varies from week to week. This is an **__intensive-reading__** class. I
reserve the right to produce (on a Wednesday) spot quizzes on the week's
reading; these will consist of 3 questions easily answered by those who have
done the reading. That way everyone will be capable of contributing to class
discussion. I demand no vast originality, and will give credit simply for
launching good questions at the instructor. The whole class benefits from a
student prepared simply to voice, for example, his or her difficulties with
the readings. **The Friday sections** are a **full part of the class** ,
indeed its main point, and attendance is essential. (Obviously class
**attendance** , including any make-ups is also **__mandatory__**.) Please
make yourself known personally in **Office Hours** to one or both of us early
in the semester; these too are an integral part of the course, which you
should treat as a resource and use to review progress or discuss points of
interest.

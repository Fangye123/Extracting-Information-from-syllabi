##### The Course:

> Public administration, mirroring much of U.S. society, is undergoing rapid
change. Three major social trends, globalization of the economy, devolution of
power to sub-federal levels, and the adoption of innovative governance
practices, are radically reshaping the practice and role of public
administration. This course, the graduate level introduction to the field of
public administration, focuses on the concepts, issues, and problems of public
management  and policy formulation, and examines the role of public sector
innovation at local, state and federal levels. We will also touch upon the
applicability of public administration concepts to non-profit (a.k.a. third
sector) management.

> The course will cover the general nature and environment of public
administration, including evolutionary changes in its meaning, context, and
significance. During the term, further attention will be given to
organizational concepts, political theory, decision-making and the policy
process, personnel systems, budgeting, and financial management,
intergovernmental relations, and administrative responsibilities.

> As this class is being taught at a graduate level, we will use a seminar
approach, rather than a classical "lecture approach." Thus class participation
both in class, and on-line (electronic) communication will be a significant
component in evaluation for grades.

##### Course Objectives:

> ![](Bullet5.gif) To understand the theoretical foundations of American
public administration and the criticisms surrounding their assumptions.

> ![](Bullet5.gif) To examine alternative models of American public
administration and the distinction between public and private sector
management.

> ![](Bullet5.gif) To overview the public policy process with particular
emphasis on the role of public managers and the political and legal contexts
within which they operate (media included).

> ![](Bullet5.gif) Develop increased awareness and understanding of staff
roles within public agencies, including both operational and ethical
considerations.

> ![](Bullet5.gif) To examine and put into practice the key managerial skills
that are required for successful public management.

> ![](Bullet5.gif) Develop research methods and on-line skills relevant to
public administration.

Manual._ NY: Prentice Hall.

##### Evaluation/Requirements:

Much of public administration relates to problem assessment, problem solving,
evaluation of alternatives and communication of these findings. In the real
world (as distinct from the academic) we rarely have "quizzes." As such the
assessment of performance in this class will be based on participation, a mid-
term examination, evaluation of two projects, communication of work performed
(presentations),and final take home exam.

Assignment 1 20% Background/Position Paper

Mid-term exam 15% Take Home

Assignment 2 20% Policy Analysis Paper  
Final Examination  30% Take Home Exam  
Attendance and Participation  15%

Each paper will be typed and prepared according to a recognized format
(provided). Typically they will be about 7-10 pages.

In general class will consist of discussion of the framework text material and
the accompanying case(s).

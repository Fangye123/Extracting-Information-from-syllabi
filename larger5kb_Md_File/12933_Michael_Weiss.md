  Welcome to the class website for 'History of Western Civilization 103.'
This term we begin with the Industrial Revolution, when machine power replaced
human and animal power as a means of production.  We will explore several
other history themese, such as 'Revolution and Romanticism,' 'Imperialism,'
World Wars I and II and the Cold War.  
     There will be three short papers due, each of which will be presented to the class.  The instructor expects to bring to class some member of the community who will discuss his experiences involving some aspect of European history.  In the past we have had WW II fighter pilots and Holocaust survivers come to class.  
        Attendance and timely submission of assignments is expected if the student wishes to pass the course .

**_WEEK #1:   APRIL 1-5_**  
   This week we had a look at the syllabus.  Also distributed was a list of 52
videos, _The Western Tradition_ series available in the LB Library.   #31-52
are on two-hour reserve at the front desk. #31-40 are relevant to this week's
chapter.  #41-42, on the Industrial Revolution will help you on next week's
chapter.  
    We covered Chapter 21 in the TEXT, which was about Napoleon and the Revolutionary Legacy.  Class lectures were on this topic as well as the background, which included the Scientific Revolution, The Enlightenment, and the French Revolution.  We saw parts of several videos on the career of Napoleon Bonaparte.  Please read Chapter 22, on the Industrial Revolution for your first class session next week.  
     The instructor distributed a sheet on how to do the first supplementary assignment, on Chapter 6:  'Work, Old and New.'  Each student was given an individual source.  If you didn't get one simply pick one.  We will begin our oral reports on this chapter on your first class session of next week.  The written assignment is due on your last class session of the week or no later than 3:00 P.M. in the instructor's office, T-224.  **To find additional information, go to the Internet History Sourcebooks, listed above.

web pages on the Industrial Revolution.  Indispensible if you're need info on
this era.

**_WEEK #2:   APRIL 8-12_**   This week we completed Chapter 21 and discussed
the decline and fall of Napoleon Bonaparte and saw a video on the revolutions
in Latin America and how they were affected by Bonaparte and the French
Revolution.  See _The Buried Mirror_ in our library 'The Price of Freedom.'
We also began Chapter 22, on the Industrial Revolution and saw part of an
excellent video, _Locomotion.  
   _The supplementary assignment, Chapter 6, 'Labor Old and New' was collected
--written form--on Friday.  The oral presentations beganin mid-week and will
continue through next week.  
     Next week we will began Chapter 23 in the text, which discusses the 'Politics and Culture of the Nation-State.'  We will discuss the unification and/or growth of France, Germany, Italy, and the United States.  
     Thursday, April 18 is an inservice day for the instructors. No classes on that day.  
  
 ** _WEEK #3:   APRIL 15-19_**   During this short week we covered many
things:  the unification of Italy and the revolutions of 1830and 1848.  We saw
a short video snippet on the 1935 version of _Les Miserables_ by Victor Hugo,
illustrating the problems of the poor in France.   We also examined the
problems of mid-nineteenth century French women through the video _Madame
Bovary_ from the novel by Gustave Flaubert.  
     On your first class session of next week we will go over all the midterm questions.  If you miss this class you will miss an irreplaceable guide to the midterm.  We will also began discussion of Chapter 24 in the text.  We will cover the Second Industrial Revolution as well as the New Imperialism and the New Immigration.  Classes will be treated to a segment from _Journey to America_ , in which you will see the journey of your ancestors across the ocean.  
     We will continue with the oral supplementary reports.  
  
 ** _WEEK #4:   APRIL 22-26_**    We covered Chapter 24 this week:  'Industry,
Empire, and Everyday Life.'  To make everyday life seem real the instructor
has been shows segments of 'The 1900 House' for 5-10 before each class.  The
videos are available in the LB Library.  Don't be concerned if the video is
being shown as you enter the room:  you're not late, nor are you expected to
know the material in these videos.  
      Subjects covered this week were:  'The Second Industrial Revolution,'  'The New Immigration,' and 'The New Imperialism.'  A particularly excellent video to see on the New Immigration is on the shelves of our library:  'Journey to America.'  
      The questions for the midterm were distributed this week.  If you've missed them look in the plastic pockets outside the instructor's office, T-224.  The midterm is to be taken in the LRC unless special arrangments are made.  
    Please read Chapter 25, 'Modernity and the Road to War,' for next week.  
We will definitely complete the oral reports next week.  
  
 ** _WEEK #5: APRIL 29-MAY 3_**    This week was somewhat unusual in that the
instructor was called back to New Jersey on Wednesday evening due to a death
in the family.  Inhis absence an excellent video was shown to the afternoon
classes.  It is entitled 'Summer of Sarajevo' and deals with the reasons for
the outbreak of World War I.  
  
 ** _WEEK #6: MAY 6-10_**    With the return of the instructor we covered
Chapter 26 in the text, which examines World War I.  Students presented some
of their oral reports on the supplementary chapter on World War I.  Midterms
were returned to students who took their exam on time and who indicated their
class day and time of day.  The instructor has five different 'History of
Western Civilization' classes, so it is very helpful if you provide this
information.  
  
**_WEEK #7:   MAY 13-17._**   On your first session of this week we will cover
the battles of Verdun and the Somme, the U.S. entry into the war, and the
collapse of Germany.  From there we will go onto to the peace treaties of
Versailles and how they paved the way for the misery after the war as well as
for World War II.  We will continue with the oral presenatations on World War
I.  The written papers on the supplementary are due on your first class
session of the week.   Be sure to read Chapter 27 for your second class
session of the week.  This chapter deals with the period after World War I,
the reoad to World War II, and World War II itself.  
  
 ** _WEEK #8:   MAY 20-24_**    We are now officially one week behind, so
please push everything down one line in your syllabus.  This week we will
cover the first half of Chapter 27 in the TEXT, from the chaos and disorder of
the post WW I 1920s and the rise of Stlain, Mussolini, and Hitler to the road
to World War II.  Our next supplementary assignment will be discussed on your
last class session of this week.  We have changed the supplementary to a
different one.  It is Chapter 13, 'Selling a Totalitarian System.'  The
written is due on your first class session of next week, which is when we will
begin the oral presentations.  
      We have completed the supplementary oral presentations on the WW I chapter in the MWF 9:00 and 10:00 classes.  Your last chance in the MWF 12:00 class to present is on Wednesday.  If you are in the TuTh 11:00 class you need to be in class this Tuesday to present.  
  
 ** _WEEK #9: May 27-31_**    This week we continued with the oral
presentations and discussed World War II and the Holocaust.  Please note that

 ** _WEEK #10:   JUNE 3-7_**   We will complete World War II and the Holocaust
this week and, if time, will cover the Cold War, from 1945 through 1953.  We

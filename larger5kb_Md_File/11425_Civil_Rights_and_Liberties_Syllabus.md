American Constitutional Law is the product of a variety of forces: informal
power and formal authority; interpretation and calculation; propriety and
practicality; mistake and happenstance. The collusion and collision of these
forces define the scope and expanse of our individual rights and liberties.

You are taking this course at a particularly important moment. The U.S.
Supreme Court of recent terms has issued several decisions that have
fundamentally altered the nature of our rights.

Three goals guide our efforts this semester:

> We will develop a better understanding of the current state of our rights
and liberties. Our interest here is specifically focused on the meaning of the
words and phrases found in the Bill of Rights of and the Fourteenth Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution. Because "the Constitution is what the Supreme Court
says that it is," we will focus our attention primarily upon the decisions of
the Court.

>

> We will determine the extent to which the Court has given what each of us
considers to be the appropriate form and function to our rights and liberties.
In other words, when faced with controversies involving components of the Bill
of Rights and the Fourteenth Amendment, does the Court "get it right"? While
we must abide by the decisions of the Court, we do not have to agree with
them. The Court, composed of fallible human beings, can and does make
mistakes.

>

> We will then figure out where the first two goals, in combination, lead. To
that end, you will have the opportunity to examine several legal controversies
that have yet to make their way to the Court. You will attempt to resolve them
on the basis of the current state of the law combined with your perceptions of
the appropriate course of action.

This class and its material are not easy. But a good faith effort on your part
and mine should produce an interesting, challenging and ultimately rewarding
semester.

**GRADING**

A. Case Opinions - Part I (minimum of two opinions) 40%  
B. Court Preparation and Collegiality 15%  
C. Case Opinion - Part II (one opinion) 30%  
D. Course Participation 15%  
  
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A. _CASE OPINIONS - Part I_ (minimum of two opinions)

You will be divided into "courts" (of approximately seven people each) for the
purpose of discussing and deciding several legal controversies (the details of
which I will provide). All controversies are active disputes at some level of
the U.S. federal court system. On February 9 and 11 and again on March 23 and
25, you will meet with the other members of your court to discuss and decide
these disputes. Attendance at these sessions is mandatory.

Out of these deliberations, the members of your court will produce a single
majority opinion for the Court. In addition, members will produce, as
necessary, concurring and/or dissenting opinions. Each of you is responsible
for writing two majority, concurring and/or dissenting opinions as members of
a court.

This portion of your course grade is worth 40%; your grade will be based only
on the opinions for which you are the lead author. Each opinion that you
author will be weighted equally.

A handout entitled Supreme Court Decisions - which I will provide \- contains
a detailed explanation of the procedures to be followed for this assignment.
It also includes a detailed discussion of the form, style and substance of
written opinions. Please read it very carefully and follow its instructions to
the letter.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

B. _COURT PREPARATION AND COLLEGIALITY_

You have two responsibilities to the other members of your court:

> 1\. You must come to the conference having carefully read all the relevant
material - case descriptions, potential precedents, and relevant statutory
language - and formed tentative views on the most appropriate resolution of
each dispute.

>

> 2\. After opinions have been assigned, the lead author(s) of the majority
opinion and, as necessary, dissenting opinions will begin the work of writing
drafts for circulation among the members of the court (concurring opinions
need not be circulated). Lead authors are responsible for writing initial
drafts and circulating them within approximately two weeks of the court
conference in which the case is decided. Members of the court who agree with
the position taken by the lead author of an opinion will then have
approximately one week in which to thoroughly read and make extensive comments
on the draft and return it to the lead author. The specific deadlines for
written work are listed below.

This portion of your grade will be based upon:

> 1\. your preparation for and participation in your court's oral
deliberations, and  
>  2\. your cooperation and effort in the timely writing of your opinions and
editing of opinions written by your colleagues.

On the last day of class, you are to provide me with a confidential evaluation
of each member of your court and suggest a grade (out of 15 points) for each
court member on the basis of his/her performance in terms of:

> 1\. the extent of their preparation for and performance during conferences,  
>  2\. the strength of their writing on initial drafts of their opinions,  
>  3\. the substance and detail of their comments on drafts of your work, and  
>  4\. their general level of cooperation.

I will not be bound by the suggested grades, but I do find them helpful.

You are to notify me immediately if a member of your court has been
particularly uncooperative.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C. _CASE OPINIONS - Part II_ (one opinion)

In addition to the legal controversies you will decide as a member of your
court, you will also be responsible for individually deciding and writing an
opinion in one case (the details of which I will provide sometime after Spring
Break). The handout entitled Supreme Court Decisions - which I will provide -
contains a detailed explanation of the procedures to be followed for this
assignment. It also includes a detailed discussion of the form, style and
substance of written opinions. Please read it very carefully and follow its
instructions to the letter.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

D. _COURSE PARTICIPATION_

There are three ways in which you can contribute to our semester-long
discussion.

> 1\. The edited case opinions in our texts have been divided into two groups.
First, there are those cases that all of us are to read. For each class
meeting, you are responsible for carefully reading and reflecting upon the
edited Supreme Court opinions (and accompanying narrative) assigned for that
particular day. At the beginning of each meeting, I will circulate an
attendance sheet. You are to sign your name, then indicate the materials you
are prepared to orally review. I will then "volunteer" those who have
indicated their preparedness. You should therefore read the assigned text
narrative and case opinions with the goal of being able to explain their
content.

>

> As to case opinions, there are three primary components:

>

>> a. the legal questions raised by the facts  
>  b. the reasoning of the majority and, as relevant, concurring and/or
dissenting opinion(s), and  
>  c. the significance of the case.

>

>  
>  When you are called upon, you are not to read from the book. Rather, you
are to summarize the materials in your own words. You will be evaluated based
on:

>

>> a. the number of classes in which you indicate a willingness to orally
review the assigned material,  
>  b. the amount of material you are prepared to discuss, and  
>  c. your ability to accurately and completely clarify the material when
called upon to do so.

>

> 2\. There are also a number of cases that have not been assigned to the
entire class, but are nevertheless important to the purpose of understanding
the evolution of constitutional law in the area of individual rights and
liberties. Therefore, for most class sessions, particular members of the class
will be responsible for reading a specific case not assigned to the class (for
the sake of fairness, longer opinions will be divided among several people).
You will then be responsible for giving the class a brief (1-2 minute) summary
of the case based on the components listed above. You will be evaluated based
upon your ability to accurately and completely clarify the assigned material.

>

> 3\. It is not enough to memorize what the justices wrote with respect to a
particular controversy. It is  
>  equally important that you think carefully about whether you agree with the
way the Court interprets and applies the relevant law to a given set of facts.

You will be evaluated based on the extent to which you become involved in our
analytical discussions of the logic enunciated in specific opinions and the
quality of your contributions. Your contributions to these discussions must
have their basis in legal and/or political considerations (and not in
emotional reactions).

**SUBMISSION DATES / GRADING POLICY**

COURT CONFERENCE I:

> Conference - February 9/11  
>  Majority and dissenting opinions circulated - February 25  
>  Majority and dissenting opinions returned to authors March 2  
>  All final opinions due to instructor March 30

COURT CONFERENCE II:

> Conference - March 23/25  
>  Majority and dissenting opinions circulated - April 8  
>  Majority and dissenting opinions returned to authors - April 13  
>  All final opinions due to instructor - April 27

With the exception of April 27, all materials are due at the beginning of
class on their respective due dates. Final drafts of Conference II Opinions
are due by 5:00 p.m. on April 27.

Because I am requiring only approximately three pieces of written work (and no
quizzes, tests or other major projects), I expect your work to be of the
highest possible quality. These opinions must be well-written, precise and
strongly support your position with legal reasoning and appropriate precedent.
You must follow the guidelines set forth in the handout entitled Supreme Court
Decisions.

WARNING: I am a stickler - to put it diplomatically - for precision and
detail. My approach to grading reflects this. I will assist you in producing
high quality work by being available to discuss the written opinions at a
mutually convenient time.

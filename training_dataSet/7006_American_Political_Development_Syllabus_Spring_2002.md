**American Political Development**

  

_Course Description_  


The study of American political development offers scholars a vehicle for
exploring many dimensions of politics, state formation, and political life in
the United States. Accordingly, during the past two decades proponents of
various analytical approaches have embarked upon historical research. From a
formal theory perspective, history offers a rich source of cases that may be
used to test various propositions. Scholars who pursue the rational choice
version of new institutionalism have drawn upon historical evidence to explore
a number of significant concepts, including structure-induced equilibrium and
endogeneity. Practitioners of other approaches likewise have turned to the
past to better explain how the political system operates today. The
descriptive-narrative new institutionalists offer single-case longitudinal and
comparative studies to demonstrate the impact of past decisions on later
institutional, political, and policy development. This research has yielded
concepts like path dependence that have become a standard component in
accounts of institutional development. At the same time, scholars of American
political ideas and culture have traced the impact of debates, narratives, and
rhetoric on politics. American political development, in short, has become the
terrain upon which the different major approaches to the study of American
politics (and political phenomena more generally) engage each other and break
down many of the standard categories within the American politics field. The
results range from positive cross-fertilization to sharp and sometimes angry
debate.  


In this seminar we will examine a number of approaches to the study of
American political development. Note that unlike a history course, this one is
not organized chronologically. Rather, each session will be devoted to the
discussion of a different analytical approach. It is to be expected that there
will be some overlap in historical coverage; indeed, that overlap is
desirable, because it will help us understand how different approaches draw
upon different kinds of evidence and illuminate different aspects of the same
phenomenon. I have selected readings that I regard as "productive": that is,
they have either generated significant discussion or have given rise to
further research that employs the same analytical tools. Students will be
encouraged to consider how the material we cover in the course might be used
as a springboard for their own research, up to and including doctoral
dissertations, in American politics and other fields.  


_Course Requirements_  


1\. Complete assigned readings before class meetings and prepare seven two-
page summaries. I have limited the number of pages in assigned readings to
keep the reading assignment manageable, though of course you may disagree with
my notion of what that means. The syllabus is also on-line at
http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~apolsky/. Over the course of the semester you
are required to submit seven typed summaries of assigned readings. These
summaries will be due at the start of the class session at which the reading
will be discussed. I do not accept late summaries for any reason. I often ask
certain students in advance to be ready to lead the discussion of specified
readings and to raise questions about an author's method and use of evidence.
It makes sense to write summaries of readings you are designated to discuss.
As indicated below, the course grade is based in part on the summaries.  


2\. Attend class regularly and participate. Contribution to the class
discussion will be considered in the calculation of the final grade for the
course. (See below under grading.)  


3\. Complete the final exam. We will decide together whether the final exam
will be an in-class exercise or a take-home exam. Either way, you must
complete the exam by the scheduled date. I will grant an extension only for
documented, valid reasons, and I will give you only as much time as you were
incapacitated. Students who do not complete the final exam will not be able to
pass the course and will not be given an incomplete grade.  


4\. Complete the research paper. As an 800-level research seminar, this course
requires a substantial research paper of standard journal-article length
(20-25 pages). I encourage you to select a topic that reflects both the course
content and your major interest in political science. For example, if
comparative politics is your major, you may wish to do a paper comparing some
aspect of American political development to that of another nation; if you are
primarily interested in international relations, consider doing a paper on the
development of American foreign policy or on how international events have
shaped domestic American development; etc. The research paper may use existing
secondary literature to explain some aspect of American political development
or may rely upon original research using archival and other sources. To get a
sense of how research in American political development is presented, I
recommend you review journals like _Studies in American Political Development_
or _Journal of Policy History_.

I will require that you identify a topic and prepare a preliminary
bibliography by a specified date during the semester. Failure to do so will,
again, make you ineligible for an incomplete grade in the course. The schedule
of topics below contains many bibliographic citations that may serve as a
useful starting point for your research. Late in the term students will give
an oral presentation to the seminar in which they will state the central
theoretical problem or question that guides their research, identify the
specific historical outcome(s) they seek to explain, present a "causal story"
that connects causal factors to the outcome(s), and indicate their plan for
carrying out the research needed to investigate the posited causal connection.
All papers must be completed by the end of the summer vacation period and
submitted to me by September 1, 2002.  


_Grading_  


Grading for the course will be based on the following:

Class participation and preparation: 25%

Final exam: 25%

Research paper: 50%

The class participation grade will be based upon the summaries and
participation. Timely completion of seven summaries establishes a base
participation grade of A-. If you submit fewer than seven, the base
participation grade drops to B; if you submit fewer than four, to C+. The
participation grade will also reflect your active, thoughtful contribution to
the discussion. As indicated above, you must maintain "satisfactory progress"
in the course in order to complete it in good standing or to be eligible for
an incomplete grade. You cannot attend sporadically, fail to submit summaries,
fail to identify a paper topic or present it to the class, tell me you are
unprepared for the final exam, and then expect to receive an incomplete. It is
my goal to ensure that you have finished all in-semester course requirements
and made a serious start on your research paper before the summer, and to have
you complete the course by September 1, 2002.  


_Books for Purchase_  


The titles listed here are available through the Hunter College Bookstore,
operated by Barnes and Noble, located at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street.
Note that these books are also on reserve at the Graduate School library. Less
expensive used copies of several titles are available on-line through
Amazon.com. Additional required readings have been compiled in a course pack
available from Campus Coursepaks, Inc. I will explain how this may be
purchased at the first class. One copy of the course pack has been placed on
library reserve, too, but I strongly recommend that you buy it.

This course is aimed at discovering the history of women of African descent in
the Americas, with a particular focus on the United States. We will be
studying black women in their indigenous environment of Africa, through the
Middle Passage, in slavery, and in freedom. We will address such issues as
labor, the black family, cultural expression, and racial identity (in
comparative perspective). We will think about the methods and tools with which
black women's history can be reconstructed. For example, we will discuss the
uses of orality, narrative, fiction, and film in representing the experiences
of black women. (11/15)

Examines the major issues in African studies, includes the cultures, political
systems, arts, and history of the continent. It is intended to provide the
student with a deeper understanding of traditional and modern African
lifestyles. It examines the European conquest and colonization of Africa in
the nineteenth century against the background of the Arab and Atlantic slave
trade from Africa. As an interdisciplinary course it will enable the student
to  evaluate questions concerning the role of African heritage in shaping the
experiences of Black peoples throughout the world. (11/14)

Africa is a vast and diverse continent whose political and cultural complexity
continues to elude Western scholars, journalists and observers. If you want to
acquaint yourself with the rich and abundant vitality of modern Africa as seen
through the eyes of Africans, then this course is for you! This course
introduces some major contemporary writers and film directors in Africa, and
will examine some of the historical, political, social and ideological forces
that shape modern African cinema and literature. Each week we will also
explore the music associated with regions from which our readings are drawn.

Through lecture, discussion, films, and a variety of readings (including

changes in culture and community, livelihood and landscape, and systems of

link between everyday experiences of "ordinary" people and broader historical
processes affecting the continent.  (14/100)

Africa is a continent few Americans know in depth. Despite historical
connections between the United States and Africa, ignorance rather than
understanding has been characteristic. Yet how can we, as Americans, best
learn about this fascinating continent? This seminar will utilize several
novels and films by Africans to help us understand better 1) why the high
hopes of independence were not fulfilled, 2) what accounts for the
"Afropessimism" of recent years, and 3) how current political and economic
restructuring are underway.

Museum Studies  
![rule](ruleahh.gif)

Museum studies offer an opportunity for students in diverse fields to broaden
their background in areas that may later be useful in employment as well as
invaluable for cultural enjoyment. Although listed for administrative purposes
in the Department of Sociology and Anthropology, these courses are suitable
for students not only in anthropology, but also in art, biology, geology, and
history.

The Museum-related classes that will be offered in the Fall Semester of 2002
are: **Museum Fundamentals** , Anthropology 4365, Tuesdays, 1:30-4:00 pm,
Museum Rm 207 (see syllabus downpage), and **Independent Study** ,
Anthropology 3379, Time To Be Determined. Both courses are taught by Adjunct
Professor Florence Schwein, the Centennial Museum Director.

Students taking classes at the Centennial Museum have the opportunity of
working on individualized projects.

During the Fall Semester 2001, Holly Mattice helped with the restoration of a
ca. 1940s diorama depicting mining in the new world. Holly (in back) and
Museum Director Florence Schwein are seen working on the exhibit. Photograph

Student Gwen Pratt worked on identifying images on Ben Wittick's glass plates
in the Centennial Museum's collections. Curator Scott Cutler, above, shows how
glass plate images were digitized in order to facilitate this research
project. The image being digitized in this photograph is shown below.

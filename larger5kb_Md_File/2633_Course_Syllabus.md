**COURSE DESCRIPTION AND GOALS**

Music is art as well as science. To be able to comprehend it to the fullest we
must, therefore, be able to appreciate both its emotional and intellectual
content.

The aim of this course is very simple: To provide you with the tools for a
basic understanding of music. It will not make you a musician or teach you how
to write music. It will, however, give you the necessary background to
understand what is going on technically when you are listening to music so
that your experience is not limited to a wash of sound that produces a certain
feeling.

The course will concentrate on  
a) The development of an attentive style of listening,  
b) The introduction and systematic study of the building blocks of music,  
c) Enhancing awareness of the main musical styles of selected western and non-
western cultures, and  
d) a brief overview of the main periods of music history.

> _**Software Requirements**

> You will need the most recent browser that supports functionality such as
Java, JavaScript, and frames. Your browser should also allow you to turn
"cookies" on. I recommend Netscape Navigator 4.7 or Internet Explorer 5.0 or
greater. You also need to install the RealPlayer for PC, or RealPlayer  for
Mac from RealNetworks in order to play the course audio material.   The
software for the course is also available on an "Installer" CD-ROM included
with the course CD-ROM.

_**E-MAIL ACCOUNTS**

Next, you will need an e-mail account. Your E-mail address is established when
you sign up with an Internet Service Provider. Check with your ISP if you do
not know what your E-mail address is. If you already have an E-mail account,
you may use this address for this online course. Remember that you will need
an ISP to access classes off-campus. **_You must have an E-mail address prior
to starting the class._

Note:** You will need your own E-mail account to participate in the course.
You will not be able to use accounts belonging to other students because of
the confusion this causes.  Several e-mail sources
([hotmail.com](http://hotmail.com), [yahoo.com](http://mail.yahoo.com)) are
available online.

_

_**INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS**

If you are planning on working on your online course from home, you'll need to
obtain Internet access through a commercial Internet Service Provider (ISP).

Note: It's very important that you sign up with a service provider as soon as
possible. Set up time may take as long as 2-3 weeks and you will need to have
this in order, and tested, before the course gets well underway!

_Computer Access on Campus - Coastline Information Commons/ROOM 103

You can use the Information Commons located at the Garden Grove Center/1st
Floor Room 103 to do your course work. You must use the headsets provided at
each PC computer station in order to listen to the course music examples
without disturbing other lab users. For days and hours of operation, please
check the course web site and click on "Information Commons".

For any other questions, please contact Professor DeWitt by E-mail, voice mail
or post your message on the course web site.

**COURSE FORMAT

**

Over the last several semesters, OMA has been offered using the powerful
combination of CD-ROM technology and the incredible resources of the World
Wide Web (WWW). The online distance education format has challenged many
traditionally held assumptions about teaching and learning. I will not go into
the many ways this has happened. I will, rather, let this exciting adventure
unfold and reveal its lessons to all of you.

There will be no lectures in this course. Actually, we will be at the opposite
pole of the lecture paradigm. In this course, you are expected to communicate
constantly with your classmates via electronic mail and Discussion Forums, and
to cooperatively learn concepts, solve problems, and complete projects. This
will be a major component of the learning experience.

This is a fully paperless class. All course materials, including the musical
examples on CD-ROM, will be accessed electronically. Electronic mail (E-mail)
and Discussion Forums will be the main source of information and interaction
among us.

However, you must be fully conscious that despite its present state of
sophistication, computer technology is, for many reasons, quite immature.
Expect to encounter many hurdles along the way. Don't be frustrated by them.
Learn from your shortcomings and those of the technologies that we will be
using.

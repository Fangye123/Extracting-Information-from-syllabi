> Course Description

>

> Since the publication of Janet Emig's famous case study _The Composing
Processes of Twelfth Graders_ , qualitative research methods have played an
important role in the field of rhetoric and composition. Arguably the most
common form of human subjects research in composition and literacy studies,
qualitative research methods are also making an appearance in rhetoric
studies, where appreciation of the rhetorical situation often requires the
rhetorician to "be present" for the communicative event. In this course we
will study qualitative research methods in rhetoric, composition, and literacy
studies, focusing particularly on the questions and methods that have been
motivating the field in the last 10 years. In addition to reading and
critically evaluating the research you will study in this course, you also
will learn how to conduct qualitative research. Among the contexts for
research we will explore will be classrooms, online learning environments, and
community settings. We will work through the process of conducting qualitative
research, from the formation of research questions to the analysis of data.
One of our central questions will be how to conduct ethical person-based
research.

>

> I will provide an environment in which you and your classmates will feel
safe to learn. It will be your job to participate in discussions with good
will and basic respect for others' views, work hard, stay motivated, and speak
up when anything we do seems unclear to you. Unlike many courses, the subject
matter of this course is the development of your own research and critical
thinking skills, development that will not occur without practice.

>

> **Attendance and Participation**. Regular attendance and participation
(regular=no more than one absence). In this postmodern age, nothing happens
outside of language. You must show up and participate if we are to "construct
meaning" together. At the graduate level, I will assume that you will be
prepared for class, on time, and offer productive discussion of the course
texts. Productive discussion will not involve disparaging the views of
classmates; furthermore, all students will be expected to provide explication
and even-handed critique of the authors read in class. It is far more
difficult to "read with" an author (that is, understand the author's purpose,
audience, context for writing, basic assumptions and overall place in the
tradition) than to "read against" him/her (which requires only that one
maintain a single theoretical view against which to read all texts). Criticism
involves both processes. Within these guidelines, I hope we will all stretch
ourselves as scholars.

>

> **Responsibilities to Peers**. Participate as an editor in the drafting
process (substantive and timely comments will be assumed). Participate in
online discussions when asked to do so. For this class, you must have access
to the Internet on a regular basis. A class listserv will be used for
announcements and continuing discussions begun in class.

>

> **Major Assignments**. Your major work for the semester will be a
qualitative research study that you conduct throughout the semester. The first
assignment will be a seven-page double-spaced, typewritten paper that presents
part of your research. The second assignment will be the literature review for
your project. The final project will be a 15-20 double-spaced, typewritten
paper that presents your research for the semester. The papers are designed to
build on each other, so that the literature review will become a part of the
final project, and the analysis you present in the first paper may become a
subsection of the final paper. In preparing your bibliographies and in
attributing sources you must follow one method of citation, e.g., the New MLA
Style. Plagiarism is professional suicide both here at UA and "out there" in
the publishing world. Please see me if you have questions about how to
attribute ideas or words to others.

>

> **Extensions**. Major projects must be turned in at the beginning of class
on the day they are due. You may take advantage of one two-day extension
sometime in the semester on any assignment except the draft of the final
paper, which will be workshopped in class. I give incomplete grades only to
students with a family emergency or grave illness. Missing deadlines for
written work will result in a reduction of the final grade for the course.

>

> **Assignment #1: Interview or Observation Study**  
>  Due date: Monday, Feb. 26

>

> Your first assignment for this class will be a brief observation study,
ethnographic interview, or oral history that you will conduct and analyze. The
purpose of this assignment is to give you experience with qualitative research
methods. Your analysis of the study will be due on Feb. 26th and should be
approximately seven pages in length (double-spaced, typewritten, 1" margins).
You will not be penalized for writing more than seven pages, but in any event,
try not to go over nine pages. You should also append your fieldnotes to the
paper (xeroxed copies of handwritten notes will be fine). If you have the
permission of your informant, you should use an audiotape. In this case, you
will hand in both the pertinent transcribed sections of your taped
interview/observation and your fieldnotes. You may find that one afternoon of
observations of one person may yield far more than seven pages worth of
analysis. If so, choose one or two insights from your observations for your
analysis. Bring double-sided, single-spaced copies of this assignment (w/o
fieldnotes and transcriptions) for your classmates.

>

> Almost any setting or collection of informants is a potential source of data
for your research; you will need to discuss possible sites, samples, and
topics with me to make sure that you have a feasible project. Because you will
be conducting research all semester, you will want to choose your site
carefully. _One absolute rule is that covert research is not permitted; you
must have the written approval of the people you study for the research for
this assignment_. If you are studying a setting where you have a prior role,
or are interviewing people with whom you have a prior relationship, you need
to discuss with me and/or the class special issues that this relationship
raises, and you should deal with these issues briefly in your final report.
Issues discussed in class are absolutely confidential; you may not discuss any
aspect of others' research and/or research issues with anyone outside this
class. We need this confidentiality to ensure that everyone feels comfortable
raising the often unusual and difficult questions that arise during field
research.

>

> Recently I met a linguistic anthropologist who admitted that it took him a
month to work up the courage to approach a group he hoped to study in Africa.
It took me a similar amount of time to begin approaching my potential
informants. Reluctance to approach new potential informants is not just an
issue for novice researchers; it is also a problem for veteran researchers.
So, be sure to begin your search early. You will need time to lose your nerve.
You will need time to set up appointments with your informants if you are
interviewing them and time for some informants to blow you off. You will need
time to transcribe tapes. You will need time to analyze all the data. It is
rough that first time or two, but approaching informants will become easier as
you go along. Here is my warning: only extraordinary reasons for extensions
will be suffered--and given--gladly. And extensions are for two days only. My
first question to you will be, when did you get started? So get started!

>

> **Assignment #2: Literature Review and Working Bibliography**  
>  Due date: Monday, Mar. 26

>

> Your second assignment for this class will be a literature review. The
purpose of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to compile sources
for and to define your research question for your classmates and me. You will
want to write the literature review as you would the opening of any research
paper. Your goal will be to make a space in the field for your own research.
That means that you should find the related literature and explain how your
work relates to it. For example, you may argue that your work _extends_ the
findings of other researchers. Or you may argue that there has been no work
like yours, but that you are guided by similar work in another area. Or you
might argue that your work refutes the work of others. Your literature review
should be at least five pages in length. Append a working bibliography of at
least 10 sources. Your bibliography should follow the new MLA Style. Bring
copies of the literature review and bibliography for all your classmates.

>

> All research begins with a literature review. A literature review is
provided at the beginning of any research report or proposal to explain what
problem in the literature the researcher proposes to address and/or what
methods he or she will use. The review links the researcher's work with the
work of others in the field. In the dissertation proposal, the literature
review establishes that the work of the PhD candidate is original and
constitutes a real contribution to the field he or she is joining. So at the
heart of the literature review are two rhetorical functions: establishing that
the author is joining an ongoing conversation in the field and establishing
that the author is not repeating what has been done before. The sources that I
am asking for in the working bibliography will form the substance of the
literature review for your final project.

>

> When I begin a new research study, the first task is to "read up" on my
subject. I cast a wide net, looking for any published work that can help me.
Generally I begin by looking at the bibliographies of articles I already know
about. Then I work through the indexes of journals that tend to publish
articles on my subject (this is especially necessary with journals like
Rhetoric Review that tend not to be indexed in on-line databases). When I have
exhausted these avenues, I work through Dissertation Abstracts, the MLA
Bibliography, and online databases like FirstSearch (an OCLC database) or
ERIC. If all else fails, I post a query to a listserv group or ask another
scholar. It is important to do your own research before asking others for
help.

>

> You do not need to wait until the first assignment is completed to complete
and hand in this assignment. In any event, you should not wait until the first
assignment is completed to begin working on this project. It can take a week
or more to get a library book that is out on loan and up to two weeks to get
an article mailed to you from another library. In addition, if you plan to
conduct further research for the final project, you probably will need to
begin it before this deadline.  
>

>

> **Final Project: Research Report**  
>  Due date: Mon., Apr. 30

>

> Your final assignment for this class will be a report of your research for
the semester. The purpose of this assignment is to give you an opportunity to
produce a potentially publishable essay reporting on research that you have
conducted this semester. Rhetorically, the research report exists to
contribute to our knowledge in the field of rhetoric and composition. You
should look specifically at _Research in the Teaching of English_ , _Written
Communication_ , or _College Composition and Communication_ for examples of
how research is reported in scholarly journals. You will see that the parts of
the report vary depending on the expectations of the journals. RTE and WC
essays tend to look more scientific, whereas CCC essays are more theoretical.
You should follow a format from one of these three journals.

>

> Some of you may wonder whether the observation or interview study that you
have conducted thus far has yielded enough data for such a project. Please see
me as soon as possible to discuss whether additional research is warranted. If
your question is, "would it be better to continue to conduct the research?"
the answer is yes. While you may feel you have enough research at this point,
your audience will always want to know that you have conducted more rather
than less observations or interviews. The more the better. At the same time,
there is an end to every project, and the life of your project may be close to
an end. So much depends on your informants' patience and time and the quality
of the data you already have.

>

> You will be assigned a date to present your findings and a draft of your
paper for peer review and group discussion on Apr. 16th or Apr. 23rd. Please
see the course policies for guidelines on the draft of this paper. Failing to
prepare the draft as directed may affect your final grade for this assignment.

Public opinion is an essential component in many theories of representative
democracy. Yet, early empirical research on mass beliefs questioned the
existence of an informed, rational public, and raised considerable doubts over
the prospects for creating a more "deliberative democracy." However, research
over the last twenty years, which has been greatly informed by cognitive and
social psychology, has expanded our understanding of the origins,
manifestations, and consequences of public opinion. Can public opinion play
the role we expect of it?

This course is designed to introduce the student to the contemporary study of
public opinion. Though potential topics for this course are vast, we will
concentrate our attention on four main questions: what is public opinion, what
are the forces affecting the formation of public opinion, what is the
distribution of opinion on major issues and towards government, and what are
the consequences of public opinion in modern politics. Students will be
expected to develop an understanding of the theoretical nature of public
opinion and convey this understanding through class participation, written
assignments, and two examinations. In order to stimulate class discussion and
learning, you will be expected to complete the assigned readings _before_
class sessions (I have no problem with calling on people to participate).

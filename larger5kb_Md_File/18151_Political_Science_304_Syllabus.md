**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** _This course involves an examination of the structure
and function of state and local government in the US. Special attention will
be given to the inter relatedness of state and local government; to the impact
of the federal government upon state and local governments; to the issues of
power and decision-making at the state and local level; and to the public
policy issues faced by state and local government._

In essence what this course is about is answering the eternal question of
politics: **Who gets What, When, How, and Why?** What you should get out of
this course is a better idea of what **tools and resources** you need as a
citizen to influence government at the state and local levels.

**GOALS: As a result of taking this class you will learn...**

  * how **political culture** and **federalism** shape public policies at the local and state level; 

  * how local and state government is organized; 

  * how local and state officials respond to political pressure from **interest groups, lobbyists, the media** and the **citizenry** ; 

  * how local and state officials make **public policies** ; 

  * what are the major public policy issues in local and state politics today? 

**ASSESSABLE OUTCOMES: As a result of taking this class students will...**

  * know the rules of the political game as it is played in local politics and in the Oregon legislature; 

  * know how to strategically think about getting local leaders and legislators to address a major public policy question; 

  * be able to analyze the major political issues which impact state and local government; 

  * be able to compare and contrast Oregon politics to the political culture of other states; 

  * be able to work collaboratively in a group gathering data/information and synthesizing that data; 

**GRADING POLICY:** your final grade for the course will be based upon
assessing your performance in the following areas we agree to listed below.

Given the importance of class participation, it's crucial to structure our
class to maximize student input. Each class day, minus those evening sessions
where we have a guest speaker, a student discussion leader will begin class by
summarizing the major points in the assigned readings. This should take
approximately 15 minutes. To facilitate this process the student leader will
photocopy a single, typed, one page outline of their summary to be distributed
to the class. Please make 10 copies. You can use our Social Science Division
copy machine for this purpose. Additionally, the other students should come to
class with a question on the reading responding to a major issue or question
raised in the readings. The questions/commentaries should be 1/2 to 1 page in
length. Each student will turn their question in at the end of the class.
These questions will be used to open up discussion after the presentation by
the student chapter(s) leader for the day. Given this approach the
instructor's role will be to facilitate this process and to add new
information to the discussion, not to lecture to the class. In this way, the
learning experience in the class will be collaborative and highly
participatory, not an instructor monologue. See below for the student leader
assignments in brackets [...]:

**Class Attendance and Participation: 30%**  
[as agreed, you will have two excused absences, after that absences will cause
your grade in this area to be lowered significantly...]  
**Analytical Essays (3): 30%**  
[the topics for these essays should deal with an issue emerging from the
readings and/or class discussion prior to the due date of the essay, length
4-6 pages, double spaced]  
**Policy Issue Analysis: 30%**  
[please consult with the instructor as you develop your paper - no later than
mid-October]  
**Group Presentation: 10%**  
[this event replaces your final exam which is why it is scheduled at the time
for the final; this abides by a college requirement that the final exam period
be used in a way consistent with the course...]

**Issue Analysis:** Using resources **outside** the class texts, write a 10-15
page double spaced paper (not including footnotes and bibliography) analyzing
the issue of **Campaign Finance Reform in Oregon** as it evolved in the
passage of Measures 6 and 9 in the November 1994 election and the subsequent
finding by the Oregon Supreme Court that these two measures were in violation
of Oregon's Constitution.

Each student is to study a different aspect of this issue: possible topics are
the 1) philosophical issues behind this reform and its opposition; 2) the
practical consequences this issue has for campaigns and elections; 3) the
campaign for and against these measures; 4) the pros and cons of using ballot
measures to make public policy decisions; 5) the role of the court system in
public policy issues; 6) the partisan lineup on this issue in the Oregon
legislature and among lobby groups; 7) the role of the media in the campaign;
8) the long term impact of this issue on Oregon politics. **DEADLINE: Dec. 8th
- 4 pm**

**Grading Criteria** on your **ISSUE ANALYSIS:** Length 10-15 pages, double
spaced, with appropriate footnotes and bibliography. Must be typed on
computer.

Grade:

**A:** mechanically clean, well-developed, very insightful analysis regarding
your policy issue; no thesis problems; well organized; excellent use of
evidence to support analysis and policy recommendation(s);  
**B:** marginal mechanical problems, good development, good insights/analysis,
marginal thesis problems; no major organization problems; good use of evidence
to support analysis and policy recommendation(s);  
**C:** adequate mechanics, fair development, merely basic insights/analysis,
significant weaknesses in the thesis; organization not clear; evidence not
clear relative to analysis and policy recommendation(s);  
**D:** weak mechanics, weak development, marginally valuable
insights/analysis, major problems in the thesis; poorly organized; poor use of
evidence to support analysis and policy recommendation(s);  
**F:** poor mechanics, lack of development, lack of insights/analysis, no
clear or poor thesis/badly organized; no visible use of evidence to support
analysis and policy recommendation(s);

These criteria will be applied in a more general way to your in class essay
exams.

**_You may trade dates for reports, but YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THERE BEING A
REPORT ON THE DATE I HAVE GIVEN YOU._**

_Bibliography and Reports_

Undergraduates will read a biography shown to and approved by the instructor
on some individual from the period of the course. Part of the grade on this
report will be based on the quality of the biography you choose, so you should
begin discussing your choice with the instructor as early as possible. You may
choose a figure from any field--business, education, law, military, politics,
entertainment, religion, the arts--except that you may not use members of the
royal family.

Your report should take 15 minutes and should emphasize primarily the shape of
the person's career. Thus, it should cover the following points as thoroughly
as possible:

1\. the social position of the subject by birth,  
2\. who gave him/her the first big break, and why,  
3\. what personal characteristics helped after that,  
4\. the length of time it took him to establish himself, and  
5\. his permanent impact on the course of English history.

Do not simply give us a summary of the life. If there is time left after
addressing these questions, you may fill up your time with any good stories
that are left over.

At the end of your report give us your assessment of the book itself:

1\. What seems to have been the author's main interest or purpose in writing
it?  
2\. Did he or she have a thesis to maintain about the character?  
3\. What did the author do especially well or especially badly?  
4\. Could you tell how solidly it was based on the evidence.

Be ready to answer a few questions about the character after you are through
with the report.

To locate biographies, use the subject search on LUIS, or consult the main
bibliographies for this period (shelved in the reference area of Library West
and can also be consulted in my office):

Godfrey Davies and Mary Keeler, _Bibliography of British History: Stuart
Period  
_ Stanley Pargellis and C J Medley, _Bibliography of British History:

_

_The Eighteenth Century

_

These bibliographies are getting out-of-date, so ask the instructor for other
possibilities. If your biography is not clear on certain facts of the
subject's life, try the _Dictionary of National Biography_ , also in the
reference area.

There is one other bibliography which might prove helpful:

William Sachse, _Restoration England, 1660-1689_. It is in a newer series,
which now looks like it will never be completed. We are, presumably, awaiting
computerized bibliographies--in essence, better subject search capabilities
from computerized catalogues like LUIS.

_Graduate Reports_

Students taking the course for graduate credit will write a paper (of about 10
pages or 2,500 words) on some controversy among historians. Such subjects
might be suggested by browsing through the bibliographies listed on the
undergraduate syllabus, or by looking through the last ten years of such
specialized journals as:

ENGLISH HISTORICAL REVIEW  
HISTORY (the journal of the Historical Association, England's equivalent of
the American Historical Association)  
PAST & PRESENT  
JOURNAL OF ECCLESIASTICAL HISTORY  
ECONOMIC HISTORY REVIEW  
ALBION  
JOURNAL OF BRITISH STUDIES  
HISTORICAL JOURNAL

to see what seem to be the most burning issues. Book reviews often refer to
such controversies. And of course, you should talk to the instructor about
your ideas. In general, the more authors you cite the better.

You might also try

Richard Schlatter, _Recent Views on British History  
_ G. R. Elton, _Modern Historians on British History  
_ J. S. Morrill, _Seventeenth-Century Britain_ (reshelve these volumes)

The report should contain:

1\. the issues which divide historians on your subject,  
2\. the reasons for the disagreements,  
3\. the state of the sources which have been, or could be, used,  
4\. what it would take to resolve the problem, or the reasons why it will
never be resolved.

Alternatively, students may present a paper of the same length on the
scholarly career of one of the following historians of our period:

Lewis Namier (political)  
Herbert Butterfield (political, intellectual)  
William Lecky (social, intellectual)  
G. M. Trevelyan (social, political)  
J. H. Plumb (political)  
Norman Sykes (ecclesiastical)  
Dorothy Marshall and M. Dorothy George (economic, social)  
George Rude (social)

Such a report should cover the following points:

1\. the theories, interpretations, themes or subjects with which this
historian is associated,  
2\. an outline of his/her training and professional career  
3\. major publications  
4\. your own observations of his/her method, favorite sources, and tendencies.

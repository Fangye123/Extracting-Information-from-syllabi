**_Objectives:_   To learn the types of psychopathologies of children and the
theoretical approaches for understanding these failures in adaptation.**

**_Expectations:_**

**1\. Students are expected to attend class in order to benefit most from the
course.**

**2\. Quizzes and exams can be made up only under the following conditions:**

**     a. The reason for the absence is illness, illness of a family member
which would prevent class attendance, or attendance at a professional meeting
of some type.  No other reasons will be accepted for making up work.**  
**     b. You inform the instructor personally and in writing ahead of time,
if possible. It is your responsibility to contact the instructor to schedule
make-ups.**

**3\. Have your reading assignments completed before the quiz over the
material.   This usually means reading and studying each assignment at least
twice.  It is strongly recommended that you also outline reading assignments,
make glossaries of new terms, and not use highlighting as a substitute for
these two methods.  For the exams, it usually means it will be necessary to
reread chapters and study notes you have made.**

**4.   The three exams are all essay and require application of concepts to
case studies.  You will be given outlines of lectures.  To study for these
exams, it is strongly recommended that you prepare an essay for each section
of the lectures.  You will need to review your answers and make sure you can
generate them during the exam.**

**5.   The final exam is comprehensive.  It is a multiple choice exam that
covers all the childhood difficulties we have studied.  Questions will be over
the presentation.  Also, for this exam, you will need to know
incidence/prevalence  and gender ratios for the following childhood
problems:**

**                         a.  autism**  
**                         b.  learning disabilities**

**                         e.  conduct disorder**  
**                         f.  depression**  
**                         g.  obsessive compulsive disorder**

**                         i.  fears and phobias**  
**                         j.  Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder**

**6.   To receive graduate credit, students will make a presentation to the
class on a topic relevant to Behavior Disorders.**  


**In addition, on the final exam you will be given a series of brief case
studies and will be asked to "diagnose" the children.   The possible diagnoses
are in the list above.**  


**6\. Any form of cheating will result in an "F" for the course and referral
to appropriate university authorities.**

**In addition, there will be multiple choice quizzes covering the graduate
student presentations.   They are not calculated into the grade.    Students
must obtain 60% or higher or there will be a reduction of one grade level on
the final grade for the class.  This criteria will be easily met if students
attend classes and attend to the presentations.**

Students in HIS 371 / 571 were asked to read Conrad Totman's
Japan Before Perry, Kenneth Pyle's The Making of Modern Japan,
Karen Brazell's translation of The Confessions of Lady Nijo, Donald
Keene's translation of Four Major Plays of Chikamatsu, Natsume Soseki's
Kokoro and Junichiro Tanizaki's The Makioka Sisters; these
served as required reading for HIS 371 / 571. The following statements
seek your evaluation of these texts.




Japan Before Perry was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE / VALUABLE
in increasing my understanding of traditional Japanese civilization and
culture.

The Making of Modern Japan Perry was WORTHLESS
/ ADEQUATE / VALUABLE in increasing my understanding of modern Japanese
civilization and culture.

The Confessions of Lady Nijo was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE
/ VALUABLE in increasing my understanding of the transition between the
Aristocratic and the Military-Aristocratic eras in traditional Japanese
history.

Four Major Plays of Chikamatsu was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE
/ VALUABLE in increasing my understanding of Military-Bureaucratic period
Japanese civilization and culture.

Kokoro was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE / VALUABLE in increasing
my understanding of Meiji era Japanese civilization and culture.

The Makioka Sisters was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE / VALUABLE
in increasing my understanding of pre-World-War-II Japanese civilization
and culture.

 I would RECOMMEND / DISCOURAGE this approach to reading
assignments in subsequent offerings of this course.

 


COMMENTS:


 

 
 
3. Two analytical essays (the first on on The Confessions
of Lady Nijo or Four Major Plays of Chikamatsu and the second
on either Kokoro or The Makioka Sisters) were required assignments
for the course. Testing was limited to a series of five quizzes spaced
throughout the semester. Together with class attendance and the completion
of a series of Interest Inventory Journal assignments, these written exercises
provided the basis for evaluation in the course.
 


 This evaluation procedure was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE
/ VALUABLE in stimulating my study of Japanese history and culture.

This evaluation procedure was WORTHLESS / ADEQUATE / VALUABLE
in assessing my knowledge of Japanese history and culture.

The quiz format now in use should be MAINTAINED / CHANGED
TO IN-CLASS ESSAY EXAMS / CHANGED TO IN-CLASS OBJECTIVE SHORT ANSWER EXAMS.

The number of quizzes required should be MAINTAINED AT PRESENT
LEVELS / MORE FREQUENT / ABANDONED IN FAVOR OF ALTERNATE EVALUATION PROCEDURES.

The essay assignments provided a VALUABLE / ADEQUATE / WORTHLESS
opportunity to review and consolidate my understanding of Japanese life
and culture.

The Interest Inventory Journal assignments proved a VALUABLE
/ ADEQUATE / WORTHLESS opportunity to assess, during the entire duration
of the course, the breadth and depth of my interests in Japanese culture
and history. In retrospect I feel I was able to pursue my identified interests
FULLY / TO SOME EXTENT / NOT AT ALL in the course of my study for HIS 371
/ 571. I have found my identified interests DEEPENED / ALTERED SUBSTANTIALLY
/ MODIFIED TO SOME DEGREE by the course of study I have just completed.

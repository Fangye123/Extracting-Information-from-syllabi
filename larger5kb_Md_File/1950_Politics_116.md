# Politics 116

# World Politics

**_

Purpose and Structure of the Course_**

This course will introduce some of the basic concepts in the study of world
politics. It is a survey course and assumes no prior knowledge or experience
in the study of International Relations. The first half of the course will
focus on the traditional perspectives in world politics; the second half of
the course will emphasize new challenges to the study of world politics. The
course will be run as a lecture, although questions, comments, and discussion
are always welcome.

**_Course Requirements_**

There will be a weekly quiz on the readings, discussions, lectures, and
current events.  I will take the ten highest grades from these quizzes (which
means you can miss some or I will drop some low grades).  The quiz grade will
constitute 50% of your final grade.

There will be an exercise in [navigating the World Wide
Web.](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/navigate.htm) The [project
](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/project.htm)will count for 50%
of your final grade.

**_Procedural Matters_**

The readings in the syllabus highlighted in blue and underlined are on the
Internet and can be accessed at:
http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/syllabus.htm.  There are no books
to purchase for this course.  However, you are required to keep abreast of
current events in world politics, and I strongly urge reading a prominent
daily newspaper.  A subscription to a newspaper would be highly recommended.

My office is 103 Skinner, and my office hours are Monday nights, 7-9 and

complex, and it serves as a useful example of the questions you may wish to
think about as you design your own site.  I have assigned this site so that
you can read about the causes of World War I.  The information is definitely
available on the site, but the organization of the site makes it difficult to
find the causes of the war.  Think about how you would redesign this page for
students who wished to find the information you think important).

### Course Description

The subject matter of this course is the history of Europe from around 1300 to
around 1500. The course emphasizes Italy and especially the Italian
Renaissance, but we will pay some attention to events north of the Alps as
well. How will this course work? We will meet once face-to-face on the first
scheduled class meeting on January 17, 1995. From then on, students will use
the required readings as their primary source of information. They will
supplement these with some readings, including short essays by the professor
(Skip Knox), that will be available on-line. Class discussions will be
conducted electronically as well. For more information on the computer
technical details, click [here](techref.html).

### Assignments

#### Term Paper

The term paper is to be a minimum of 10 pages long (15 pages for graduate
students), not including front and end matter. It can be on any topic within
our period, but you must use at least three different book-length sources
(graduates must also use journal literature). For term papers I prefer end
notes over footnotes.

I would like your term paper turned in both electronically and physically. The
physical version must be double spaced.

#### Discussion

Class discussion is handled on the list. I expect everyone to participate
fully. While I will not grade on sheer volume, I regard two contributions a
week to be a bare minimum and expect to see three to five from most of you.

The quality of the participation is the most important factor. Quality covers
originality or insight demonstrated, as well as the clarity of the
communication. While on-line discussion is not formal writing, the more
thoughtful your participation and the better expressed, the better your grade
will be.

#### Diplomatic Reports

These are short reports written weekly. Each of you will choose a city or
state that will be yours for the semester. Each week you will write a report
on what of significance and/or interest was going on your state during a
quarter century span (see the Course Schedule).

These reports are not scholarly works. Write them as if you were a diplomat
from Florence making a report to the signoria on conditions in foreign lands.
Such reports naturally covered political conditions, but they often also
contained information on economic trends, peculiar social customs, and
(naturally) court gossip.

The intent of these reports is that the whole class can become better informed
about various places in Europe. Have some fun with this. You do not need to
cite sources for this exercise, but of course you cannot make things up,
either!

### Computer Details

#### Resources On-Line

A number of resources will be available on-line via the Internet. Some of
these will be supplementary, but others will be required reading. Since you
are reading this document you already know how to get to the resources -- use
some sort of WWW browser (Lynx, Mosaic, Cello). You can access the browser on
campus from any of several labs. You can access from home by dialing into
BSUINFO.

#### Class Discussions

All class discussion will be handled through a Bitnet list. To participate,
you **must** have an e-mail account (available from the Data Center in B-116).
Once you have the account, send a message to

    
    
    listserv@idbsu.idbsu.edu

. Leave the subject line blank. The text of the message must be

    
    
    sub hy309-l first last

where _first_ is your first name and _last_ is your last name.

You should get a message back within a few minutes telling you that you've
been added to the list. That message will contain further instructions on how
to use the list most effectively. Once you've joined the list you are welcome
to post messages, even if the semester has not yet started.

Working from Home You can get to mail and to the Web from home. You must have
a computer with at least a 9600 baud modem (14.4 much preferred), and you must
get the Trumpet software -- regular communication software won't do the job.
If you have your own SLIP software it may work, but BSU cannot support it. Get
Trumpet.

Start by going to the Data Center in B-116. There you can get your e-mail
account and the booklet with the orange cover about student computing at BSU.
Around page 15 is instructions on how to get Trumpet, install and configure
it, and how to dial in.

Trumpet is actually two programs. One, TCPMAN, does the dialling but nothing
more. The other part (Trumpet) lets you read mail. You will, in addition, need
a Web browser. You can use either Netscape or Mosaic. These can be found at
the same site as you found Trumpet. They are in the Internet directory.

If you have questions about this, or need help, call me or come by the Faculty
Computer Lab in SMITC-209.

    students, particularly Muslim
    students, from all over the subcontinent, West Asia, and Africa. The
    city is also a centre of lock
    making industry with considerable population of highly skilled but
    poorly paid workers.
    
    General Information
    
                                         
    
      SADA is a voluntary organisation, registered under the Societies Act
    (1860). It has its
      registered office at Aligarh. Its primary goal is to empower people
    through awareness.
      SADA aims at facilitating all possible initiatives and interventions
    ,in the areas of literacy,
      education, health, environment, human rights, and consumer rights,
    etc. Networking, helping
      and sharing are its main modus operandi.

                              About the city of Aligarh
    
                                         
    
      Aligarh, a district and town in Uttar Pradesh, is located 130 km's
    south east of New Delhi,
      the Capital of India. It lies on the Delhi-Calcutta national train and
    road routes. It is more
      famously known for its traditional cottage and small scale industries
    in Locks and Brass
      Hardware. One of the eleven central universities, The Aligarh Muslim
    University, is also
      located here. Like other such small towns, Aligarh has its share of
    issues and problems:
    
           A virtual breakdown of civic amenities, like water supply, roads,
    sewerage and
           garbage disposal systems. 
           A large population, requiring basic facilities and help in
    education, health care, medical
           facilities and employment. 
           It has also been the focus of several studies on child labour
    working in Lock and
           Brass Industries. Several attempts have been made in the past to
    highlight their plight
           and hazardous nature of their work. 
           Aligarh has also experienced frequent communal violence in the
    past, resulting in
           hardships and dislocations to a large group of people. 
           Having a large, central university, has provided both challenges
    and opportunities.
           Though there are several school and colleges, they are
    insufficient to cater to the
           increasing population. There is a need for vocational
    ,educational, career guidance and
           counseling at several level.
    
       
    
                            What SADA is trying to do
    
                                          
    
           To form networks, at local, national and international levels.
    This will result in sharing
           of resources, experiences and training of people and
    organisations working in similar
           areas. 
           To provide support, guidance and help to individuals and groups
    engaged in similar
           work in and around Aligarh.

           workshops for trainers and activists. 
           To use mass media, through sponsored articles and contributions,

           awareness about democratic and secular values.

    Chipko Movement, India
    
    Category of Activity
    Environment and Sustainable Development 
    
    Brief Description
    From their origins as a spontaneous protest against logging abuses in Uttar Pradesh in the Himalayas, thousands of
    supporters of the Chipko movement, mainly village level women, have won bans on clear felling in an number of
    regions and influenced natural resource policy in India. The name of the movement comes from a word meaning
    "embrace". The women practiced satagraha - non-violent resistance, and interposed their bodies between the trees and
    the contractors' axes, thus becoming the environmental movement's first tree huggers. [Note: Did not participate in
    Study Conference in New York, 22-24 Sept. 1995]

    The forests of India are a critical resource for the subsistence of rural peoples throughout the country, but especially in
    hill and mountain areas, both because of their direct provision of food, fuel and fodder and because of their role in
    stabilising soil and water resources. As these forests have been increasingly felled for commerce and industry, Indian
    villagers have sought to protect their livelihoods through the Gandhian method of satyagraha non-violent resistence. In
    the 1970s and 1980s this resistance to the destruction of forests spread throughout India and became organised and
    known as the Chipko Movement. 
    
    The first Chipko action took place spontaneously in April 1973 and over the next five years spread to many districts of
    the Himalaya in Uttar Pradesh. The name of the movement comes from a word meaning 'embrace': the villagers hug
    the trees, saving them by interposing their bodies between them and the contractors' axes. The Chipko protests in Uttar
    Pradesh achieved a major victory in 1980 with a 15-year ban on green felling in the Himalayan forests of that state by
    order of India's then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Since then the movement has spread to Himachal Pradesh in the
    North, Kamataka in the South, Rajasthan in the West, Bihar in the East and to the Vindhyas in Central India. In
    addition to the 15-year ban in Uttar Pradesh, the movement has stopped clear felling in the Western Ghats and the
    Vindhyas and generated pressure for a natural resource policy which is more sensitive to people's needs and ecological
    requirements. 
    
    The Chipko Movement is the result of hundreds of decentralised and locally autonomous initiatives. Its leaders and
    activists are primarily village women, acting to save their means of subsistence and their communities. Men are
    involved too, however, and some of these have given wider leadership to the movement. Prominent Chipko figures
    include: Sunderlal Bahuguna, a Gandhian activist and philosopher, whose appeal to Mrs. Gandhi results in the
    green-felling ban and whose 5,000 kilometre trans-Himalaya footmarch in 1981-83 was crucial in spreading the
    Chipko message. Bahuguna coined the Chipko slogan: 'ecology is permanent economy'. 
    
    Chandi Prasad Bhatt, one of the earliest Chipko activists, who fostered locally-based industries based on the
    conservation and sustainable use of forest wealth for local benefit. 
    
    Dhoom Singh Negi, who, with Bachni Devi and many village women, first saved trees by hugging them in the 'Chipko
    embrace'. They coined the slogan: 'What do the forests bear? soil, water and pure air'. 
    
    Ghanasyam Raturi, the Chipko poet, whose songs echo throughout the Himalaya of Uttar Pradesh. 
    
    Indu Tikekar, a doctor of philosophy, whose spiritual discourses throughout India on the ancient Sanskrit scriptures and
    on comparative religion have stressed the unity and oneness of life and put the Chipko Movement in this context. 
    
    A feature published by the United Nations Environment Programme reported the Chipko Movement thus: 'In effect
    the Chipko people are working a socio-economic revolution by winning control of their forest resources from the
    hands of a distant bureaucracy which is concerned with selling the forest for making urban-oriented products.' 
    
        "The solution of present-day problems lie in the re-establishment of a harmonious relationship between
        man and nature. To keep this relationship permanent we will have to digest the definition of real
        development: development is synonymous with culture. When we sublimate nature in a way that we
        achieve peace, happiness, prosperity and, ultimately, fulfilment along with satisfying our basic needs, we
        march towards culture." Sunderlal Bahuguna

           We believe in Gandhi's  maxim of "production by masses" instead of "mass production" 
      
    
                          The objective of the organisation is to create technological infrastructure for
    generation of
         employment and workplaces in areas with low capital investment and high labour usage. The idea is
    to create
         jobs where most people live, i.e. rural areas in developing countries and not in urban areas where
    they tend to
         migrate. It was considered that the objective can be achieved by dispersing and decentralising
    industries and
         by developing technologies for them 
         and also developing new processes and new products to give more work to rural industrialist. This
    envisages
         utilisation of local skills and resources by promoting income generating activities and by
    harnessing
         decentralised and renewable sources of energy and improving habitat, human settlements in the rural
    areas for
         improving quality of life.

         Student Level Courses: These are designed for students enrolled in existing institution awarding
         degree or diploma. The present courses however, do not have features that promote a critical
    understanding
         of the subject in relation to society and environment. While the course work would attempt to
    bridge this gap,
         it is planned to organise it in conjunction with field projects on appropriate technology  to
    provide
         opportunities for understanding of practical difficulties in the  process. The course can be
    planned in the
         existing degree or diploma awarding institution with field work in S.I.A.T. premises . Successful
    students will
         be given higher diploma  in appropriate technology. In the long run, however, we hope to develop a
    full time
         student course work in different areas of specialisation for students completing intermediate
    education. These
         courses are organised in the following subjects: 
    
         1. Agricultural processing of village produce. 
         2. Renewable sources of energy. 
         3. Small cottage industries for rural area. 
         4. Survey of all equipment used un the rural areas like potter`s wheel, weavers loom,

         5. Better utilisation of  resource in rural areas like  paddy husk, saw dust, tree  seeds, barks, 
             leaves  etc. 
         6. Design and development of machinery and equipment to be operated by human and 
             animal power. 
    
           
    
    
            
         Professional Level: This course work is designed for professional officers in the field of
    development
         and welfare, bank managers, programme administrators at the block level, planners and policy makers
    of
         appropriate technology, and the teachers so that they could acquire a broader understanding of
    concepts, and
         practices, views and techniques and take more informed decisions in their particular spheres of
    activities. The
         duration of the course work is kept flexible to accommodate the time and information needs of

                            Z-133/34 Sector XII
                            Noida 201 301
                            Uttar Pradesh
    
    
    Project Holder:         Ms. Anjina Rajgopal
    
    Project Title:          BALKUTIR
    
     
    Background Details including situational analysis
    
    Sai Kripa, the branchild of Anjina Rajgopal, came in to existence in 
    1988 as a non-profit society whose main objectives were to provide 
    parental love, food, education and a little of dignity to those children 
    who were rendered homeless due to circumstances beyond their control.  
    Since its inception, Sai Kripa has successfully turned into a 
    full-fledged organization with diverse activities detailed below.
    
    Balkutir
    Balkutir is a home for orphan children, started in 1990.  There are 22 
    children in Balkutir at present.
    
    Sai Shiksha Sansthan
    Started in April 1991 with 80 students and four teachers, the Sai 
    Shiksha Sansthan consists of children (including those from 
    Balkutir) that are primarily first generation learners.  Their 
    attendance tended to be very poor since the children went to 
    the fields to help their parents.  However, as the children and their 
    parents begin to understand the value of education, they come to school 
    regularly and take a lot of interest in studies.  Consequently, the 
    class strength has increased to 145 students.  Accordingly, the number 
    of teachers has also increased to 7.  Initially the classes ranged from 
    lower kindergarten up to class II.  They have now gone up to class IV.  
    Sai Kripa is currently attempting to register the school.    
    
    Vocational Training Center
    The tailoring unit of Sai Kripa was set up in December 1992.  The idea 
    is to help the older children and the women of Balkutir.  The women from 
    the neighboring localities and those in distress come to Sai Kripa to 
    get training in this field so that they can be independent in a couple 
    of years.  The center also helps to generate income for Sai Kripa.
    
    
    
    Objectives of the Organization
    
    Philosophy and aim: A child is orphaned or abandoned for no fault of its 
    own.  As a human being, he/she has every right to lead a decent life and 
    society in general is duty bound to provide the necessary means and 
    opportunity to such children.  
    
    a) To provide a home for orphaned or abandoned children.
    
    b) To provide a creche for the children of working mothers.
    
    c) To provide a temporary home for needy children
    
    d) To provide basic education and awareness of health and hygiene to  
       street children.
    
    e) To provide vocational training and adult literacy classes to women.
    
    
    
    Review of CRY Support During the Financial Year 1995-96
    
    CRY continued to support Sai Kripa's Balkutir program during 1995-96.  
    Though the program was designed to have 15 children, at the end of the 
    year, the number had increased to 22 children.   What follows is an 
    account of the progress the children of Balku tir during the past year. 
    
    1) Rajat :  the first child in the Balkutir program is 17 years old 
    now.  Since he is mentally retarded and physically handicapped, it has 
    become very difficult for him to concentrate on any trade related 
    education.  During the past year he was involved in the income 
    generation program of the organization like tailoring, wood carving, 
    etc.  He also does the gardening in the green belt given to the 
    organization by NOIDA authority.
    
    2) Meera: She found it very difficult to continue her studies since she 
    was 14 years old and was in class IV.  She left the school and is now 
    training in tailoring and knitting at the vocational training and income 
    generation program of the organization.
    
    3) Raju: Raju is 13 years old and was promoted from class V to class 
    VI.  He is very good in studies .  He admires animals and birds so 
    much.  So Balkutir looks forward to see him as a veterinarian.  
    
    4) Sangeeta: Sangeeta,11, was promoted to class II during the year.  She 
    has been helped out her psychological trauma problems and has made good 
    progress in her education.
    
    5) Sanju: Sanju, 9, was also promoted to class II.  He is healthy and 
    performs excellently at studies.
    
    6) Sethi: Sethi has been with Balkutir since 1994 and has been promoted 
    from Lower to Higher Kindergarten at the age of 11.
    
    7) Raffi: In class I, this 9 year old is healthy both physically and 
    mentally and performs well at school.
    
    8) Sachin: Sachin came to Balkutir as an infant and is now three years 
    old.  A handsome child, he now attends play school
    
    9) Sruti: Sruti was a pre-mature child, 6 days old when she was admitted 
    to Balkutir.   She is now 4 and attends play school with Sachin near their home.
    
    10) Pallavi: Pallavi is 3+ now and attends pre-nursery.  She is enjoying

    13) Rohit and 14) Arati are one year old children who have completed a 
    year with the program.
    
    9 children joined the Balkutir family during the past year bringing the 
    total up to 22.  Of this total 14 are supported by CRY.  Sai Kripa 
    raised funds to the tune of $3000 during the year and this was used to 
    look after the additional children.
    
    The children are growing physically and mentally in an improved 
    atmosphere.  They are happy and full of hope for the future.  They 
    celebrated children's day this year.  Anjina Rajgopal known to the 
    children as `mother' ensures that each child gets love, care and 
    friendship and thus encourages their growth in a happy environment.
    
    
    Non Financial Support Rendered & Necessary
    
    *       $300 worth of Material support given
    *       Staff training was organized by CRY
    *       Professional support is needed in planning the program
    *       Project holder needs training in fund-raising
    
    
    Planning for the year 1996-97
    
    CRY will continue supporting the integrated growth of 15 children during 
    the year 1996-97.  The support, both financial and non-financial will be 
    utilized toward providing the children facilities for their physical, 
    mental, educational and other development.
    
    Sai Kripa has consciously decided to place a ceiling of 25 children in 
    the program.  They plan on finding suitable avenues for 
    directing/forwarding the children that come during the next year to 
    various adoption centers.
    
    
    Budget
    
    An amount of $7000 has been recommended for Sai Kripa for the year 
    1996-97.  Detailed budget is available upon request.

    			Little Stars School Project  
    
    Little Stars School, Varanasi 
    ("Free Education Only for Street, Poor & Helpless Children") 
    
    
    Project Description 
    Little Stars School was started by Asha Pandey on July 1, 1996 in Varanasi. The aim of this project
    is to provide education to
    those children who due to extreme poverty do not have the opportunity to go to school. The
    education provided at this school
    encompasses "practical, social, moral, physical and spiritual aspects of Indian culture." Mrs.
    Pandey started this school for 15
    students in her home and now would like to expand this to 100 students. 
    
    
    Estimated Amount 
    Approximately US $23,000 to build a 3200 sq. ft. school that can house students. 
    They intend to initially build: 
    * large hall 
    * 2 toilets 
    * 4 classrooms 
    * storage space 
    
    Of course they're looking for donations of any amount. Asha-Syracuse 
    has donated $1k so far and all of the school expenses (teachers salary, 
    etc. is being donated by Asha-Berkeley). 
    
    
    Benefit 
    Her aim is to provide these students with a solid educational foundation on which they may choose
    to build further. For
    example, she currently educates the 15 children up to 5th grade. Her goal is that "by receiving
    good education at this institution,
    children will be able to continue their education starting from sixth grade standards by obtaining
    admission into any state or
    privately run Hindi medium schools." 
    
    
    > The Little Stars School: A Brief Overview 
    > 
    > The Little Stars School, developed by Asha Pandey, began on July 1,
    1996. It
    > was founded with the hope and intention of growing and developing as
    the
    > children who come also develop and grow.
    > Asha Pandey is the project coordinator. She received her M.A. in
    psychology
    > from Banaras Hindu University, as well as completing a one year
    teacher's
    > training course. Upon graduation, she worked for 2 years as a teacher
    at the
    > Ram Niwas school, as well as at the St. Atulanand Central school, both
    in
    > Varanasi. At St. Atulanand"s there were 65-70 children under her
    supervision
    > in the classroom. The methods at this school were not beneficial to
    teaching
    > or learning for that matter and Mrs. Pandey became bored with the
    monotony of
    > the existing system. Children could not learn because they were not
    receiving
    > the attention or the support that they needed. Everyday she saw
    children in
    > her neighborhood who were not in school. Mrs. Pandey talked to the
    parents of
    > these children about sending their children to school for a few hours
    a day;
    > she asked the children if they wanted to come. It was then, with
    community
    > support on her side, that she decided that she would create a school,
    based on
    > her experience, for those children who were forgotten by the
    educational
    > system. 
    > The aim of this project is to provide an education to those children
    who, due
    > to extreme poverty have not had the opportunity to go to school.
    Children who
    > are orphans, who work to contribute to meager family earnings and
    those who
    > beg. This school is now operating from nursery level to 1st/2nd
    standard and
    > it is the project's aim to develop the school up to 5th grade
    standard. It is
    > the school's goal that, by receiving a good education at this
    institution,
    > children will be able to continue their education starting from 6th
    standard
    > by obtaining admission into any state or privately run Hindi medium
    school.
    > The education provided at this school has to encapsulate and convey
    practical,
    > social, moral, physical, and spiritual aspects. Care is taken to
    discover
    > every child's hidden talents and special capabilities in order to
    encourage
    > and develop each childms character. 
    > There are 75 children presently enrolled at this school; they range in
    age
    > from 4- 14 years. These children are either from the neighborhood of
    the
    > school (Assi), or are brought in by rickshaw from the main ghat
    > (Dasashwamedh). The children from Assi are mainly Bengali and most
    live in a
    > small shanty town located next to Varanasi's last ghat. Dasashwamedh
    is
    > Varanasi's largest ghat; it opens up to the main bazaar and is quite
    different
    > from Assi's residential and more relaxed atmosphere. The children from
    the
    > main ghat are homeless. Many families came from Bihar or neighboring
    villages
    > in search of work; then without money or resources to return home,
    they have
    > settled along the ghat's periphery. The project has given priority to
    those
    > children who are extremely poor and without basic resources; for this
    reason
    > the Dasashwamedh children have been accepted. These children are
    brought up
    > in a completelydifferent environment from many Indian children. Child
    labor in
    > India is a viable means for added income. Children living amongst
    poverty
    > begin working at a very small age; whether it is with their parents or
    older
    > siblings. Some ways these children are employed include: picking up
    trash in
    > front of stores, begging, working in road side stalls selling tea or
    tobacco,
    > pushing food carts, and/or working at others' houses cleaning and
    washing
    > clothes. For these children and their parents, school is not a top
    priority;
    > every member of the family is expected to contribute what they can to
    family
    > resources, even if for only a few rupees a day.
    > The parents of these children who are employed drive cycle rickshaws,
    wash
    > dishes, clean clothes, cook for others, or sweep the streets (which
    are all
    > low paying and seen as degrading jobs). Some children have parents who
    are
    > alcoholics or drug addicts and many abuse their children, other
    childrenms
    > parents beg or steal, and some children have no parents at all.
    > These children need to learn more than the basic survival skills they
    have
    > soaked up since childhood. They know how to live from day to day, but
    they
    > must be taught that a better life exists beyond their immediate
    surroundings.
    > Therefore it is crucial that this school have an alternative type of
    structure
    > to work with these children's special and specific needs. 
    > >From the beginning, this school has been run as a Non-Formal
    Educational
    > Institution. Five days a week class begins at 9:30 a.m. and continues
    until
    > 12:30 p.m; on Saturday school is 1/2 day. The schedule allows children
    to
    > work after class if necessary, thereby ensuring regular attendance.
    Another
    > aspect of this project is to insure the health and safety of these
    children.
    > Due to the lack of basic necessities in their lives it is this
    projects' goal
    > to be able to provide nutritious food on a daily basis as well as
    basic health
    > care. These facilities are necessary when children come to school with
    > problems such as: hepatitis, fevers, wounds, lice, etc., all of which
    > interfere with a good learning environment. 
    > Apart from Mrs. Pandey, there are four other teachers formally working
    at the
    > school. This allows the children to be divided into five groups
    according to
    > their level of learning, development and ability. Ideally, there would
    not be
    > more than 15 children per teacher so that each child is able to
    receive the
    > personal attention which is essential for the learning process. The
    true
    > interests of children can be seen and encouraged by having a
    curriculum based
    > on reading, writing, mathematics, as well as singing, recitation, and
    arts and
    > handi-crafts. In addition, everyday basic hygienic practices are
    taught to
    > these children, thereby encouraging health and improved personal
    standards of
    > cleanliness. The teachers at this school are not merely interested in
    > teaching children the rudimentary subjects but also to teach
    self-respect,
    > self-discipline and self-motivation. 
    > Despite the outnumbering odds against them, these children are
    learning. At
    > the start of this project the children came to school extremely dirty
    and
    > unkempt, many spoke constantly in vulgar words (a reflection of their

    importance
    > of coming to school with clean hands, feet and combed hair, and
    behaving with
    > proper manners. Many of these children have had no previous experience

    to
    > listen to directions. Now when the children come to school they are

    > educated with teaching degrees. They are given the freedom to
    structure
    > their classes as they wish. Through my own observation they are each
    doing
    > a wonderful job. Mrs. Pandey is working with a new nursery level
    teacher
    > who does not have much experience but is willing to learn. This new
    teacher
    > is enthusiastic, focused and doing well in teaching these children in
    the
    > very first stage of school. The school is now divided as follows:
    > - Bharti Patel teaches nursery class - children in this class are of
    > the widest range in age and education. Children are put into this
    group
    > to test their level of learning. Many children are not yet learning
    > the alphabet while others are beginning to be taught the concepts of
    > the first letters. The nursery class is the largest with approximately
    > 25 children.
    > - Gayatri Pandey teaches lower Kg - This class has approximately 15 -
    20
    > children. In this class the children are working on fine tuning their
    > knowledge of the Hindi and English alphabets and Hindi and English
    > numbers.
    > - Sangeetha Kumari teaches the Upper Kg class - The children in this
    class,
    > for the most part, have been attending the school since it began and
    are
    > progressing at a normal rate. They are working on mantras and
    > dictation as well as simple math equations.
    > - Asha Pandey teaches a small group of children who are between
    levels. She
    > has the smallest class as she also supervises the activities in all
    the
    > classes. The children in her class are preparing to enter either the
    > lower or upper Kg. 
    > - Sunita Upadhya teaches the combined 1st & 2nd class. For the most
    part
    > the children are the oldest in the school and are taught complex
    > dictation, reading for comprehension, more complex math and are
    introduced
    > to the English language.
    > During the winter season the school hours are 9-12:30 pm. Over the
    past
    > seven months the school has been running quite smoothly. The
    competency of
    > the new teachers creates a disciplined atmosphere without the
    overbearing
    > tactics necessary when a school is out of control. The methods of the
    > teachers is extremely interactive. The teachers are constantly giving
    > one-on- one attention to their students and the children work hard
    knowing
    > that they are under close observation. I saw the older children taking
    > responsibility for the school upkeep and helping with the new and
    younger
    > students. The structure of the school is really teaching these
    children
    > what it means to be in school. They are learning how to behave
    properly
    > and understand the need to take their studies seriously. These
    children look
    > to their teachers not only for answers to homework questions; they
    look to
    > their teachers as a means of personal support and recognition and as a
    way 
    > to build a strong sense of self. Even more The Little Stars School has
    > become a place for these children to be somebody special.
    > Due to the support of the ASHA organization the school has better
    equipment
    > for teaching and learning. The children sit on nice carpets and mats,
    there
    > are plenty of pencils, notebooks etc, the teachers sit at desks
    allowing them
    > to organize materials and to have a clear cut role of authority in the
    > classroom. In addition the children are given a nutritious snack/meal
    of
    > chickpeas and vegetables at the end of every day ensuring that they
    are
    > eating at least one proper meal a day. Currently a volunteer names 
    > Christoph comes in from Assi and cooks. After he leaves, Asha will
    locate
    > a permanent cook for the school.
    > 
    > I was able to visit the new land which has been purchased over the
    last
    > few months due to the support of Ashas uncle in Sonoma county. The
    land
    > is a five minute walk from the schools present location. As money
    > becomes available and student numbers increase, the blueprints include
    > possibilities for a 2nd and 3rd floor. The school has entered into a
    new
    > neighborhood and the accessibility for the children of the Nagwa -
    Lanka
    > area has created more opportunities. 
    > 
    > Concerning the confusion over the building costs I have also included
    > the> proper figures as of March 1998. The cost per square foot, all
    > inclusive (electrical, plumbing, glass), is 350 Rs (~$10 US). It is
    > necessary to begin building as soon as possible in order to relocate
    the
    > school to its permanent address. For total construction of the
    building
    > plans is approximately $23,000 US. The cost of partial building (which
    > would allow the school to begin running) is as follows:
    > 1 Large Hall
    > 1 Class Room
    > 1 Lounge (which would be used as a temporary classroom)
    > 1 Hallway
    > 1 Toilet
    > 1 Stairway
    
    > At 921.18 square feet totals $9211 US for construction. The figures
    > previously sent were only a rough estimate and unfortunately were
    quite a bit
    > lower than the current need. Once the school is relocated however the
    added
    > expense of rent will be eliminated, saving the school money in the
    long run.
    > Asha and I have looked at the architectural plans and have concluded
    that this
    > is the minimum building required to relocate the school. She is also
    asking
    > her uncle to donate money to build the entry way, office and kitchen.
    > During the early stages of construction the toilet in the office will
    have a
    > temporary outside entrance for childrens use. 
    > 
    > Asha Pandey asks for as much help as possible understanding however
    that
    > her request is large. Any contribution from the ASHA organization is
    accepted
    > with the deepest of gratitude and respect. As the members of ASHA

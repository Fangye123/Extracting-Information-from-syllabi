Provosts on Portals is a project designed for  AASCU provosts and chief
academic officers.  It is the result of a partnership between the American
Association  of State Colleges and Universities and the Teaching Learning
Technology Group to explore just-in-time learning for very  
busy senior university officials.  The topic for the first pilot project is
web portals, an emerging phenomenon that promises to revolutionize the ways
universities can communicate and create community.  

Participants receive very brief e-mails, in a sequenced order, providing
information on various aspects of web portals.  The e-mails  contain links to
sample web portals, papers about portals, and other resources.  Participants
receive two e-mails a week, starting on October 2nd, and ending in mid-
December.   If you are new to this material, one suggested approach is to
sequence these lessons in the order in which they were presented.

![](imgs.res/dirchock.gif) **introduction **  
An examination of Japanese films of the 1980s and 90s within the context of
theories of cultural identity and difference. How do films replicate and
refute notions of cultural identity and nationhood, particularly when
transnational capitalism increasingly homogenizes cultural difference? The
cult of Kurosawa, rhetorics of national uniqueness, Orientalist cinema and
sexuality, translated nostalgia, nuclear and imperial criticism,anime and its
implications, Kitano Takeshi as international filmmaker. Films include works
by Kurosawa, Imamura, Oshima, Itami, Otomo ("Akira"), Kitano, Suo.

![](imgs.res/padpaper.gif) **logistics **  
The class meets once a week, Tuesday from 3:15-5:45 in Building 200, Rm. 303.
Attendance is, of course, mandatory. All readings for the week must be
completed before class (preferably before the screening).  
Requirements include a short take-home midterm, in-class final, and final
paper. Students are strongly urged to discuss paper topics with the instructor
as soon as possible. Office hours are Mondays 3:00-5:00 and Tuesdays
11:00-12:00 (or by appt.)

![](imgs.res/padpaper.gif) **newsgroup **  
There is a class newsgroup, to which students are strongly recommended (read:
"required") to post opinions, ideas, and other musings about readings,
screenings, and lectures. Participation in both class discussion and the
newsgroup will determine class participation grade.

![](imgs.res/popcorn.gif) **screenings**  
A screening of assigned films will be offered every Monday at 7:00, beginning
April 3 in Building 200, Rm. 313. You are required to attend all screenings.
If you are unable to attend a screening (only acceptable excuses are natural
or personal catastrophes), you may try to relive the big screen experience by
watching the tiny video screens at Meyer. Videos of all required films are on
reserve.

![](imgs.res/openbook.gif) **readings**  
The only required text is the bulky course reader available at the campus book
store (Note: to keep costs down, only required readings are in the course
reader. All readings [including optional and recommended readings] are on
reserve at Meyer Library). There are no required books to be purchased, but
the optional reference work, Bordwell and Thompson's Film Art: An
Introduction, (highly recommended for those who have little experience with
academic film courses) is available on reserve. Furthermore, I have posted
numerous articles, clippings, anecdotes, etc. on the website that are
unavailable in the reader or through reserve. Read them without spending a
cent or stepping outside the comfort of your room. For a detailed listing of
all readings, please refer to the _[syllabus](AL75.00/syl.html)_.

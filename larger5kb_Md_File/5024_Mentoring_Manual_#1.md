**1.   Preamble**

The educational philosophy of Le Moyne College is rooted in the Jesuit
tradition, which endeavors to "educate the whole person"--in mind, body and
spirit. At Le Moyne, "educate the whole person" means that students are given
a solid liberal arts curriculum of required courses, in addition to a
practical, field-specific curriculum of study in their major; that courses in
all disciplines explore the value-laden dimensions of human experience; and
that student involvement in extra-curricular activities (such as sports,
campus ministry, and volunteer projects) is viewed as integral to the
development of the whole person.

The foundation of Le Moyne's liberal arts education is the Core Curriculum,
required of all students at the College. Except for one natural science and
one social science course, the Core consists entirely of humanities courses:
9-12 credit hours in English, 9-12 hours in philosophy, 6-9 hours in history,
and 6-9 hours in religious studies, spread over a student's four years at Le
Moyne. If you teach core courses, you will have in your classes not only
humanities majors, but students from every discipline and major the College
offers.

Core courses are designed to teach the critical writing, critical thinking,
and analytical skills that will serve students in whatever other classes they
take in college, and in whatever disciplines or professions they pursue
following graduation. Core courses are also designed to assist students in
acquiring knowledge, attitudes, and values that will help them become good
citizens of the global community and lead meaningful lives. As you design and
as you teach core courses, you must keep these requirements in mind. Since
elective courses in the various humanities disciplines teach the same skills
and kinds of knowledge, you should consider these skills and knowledge the
foundation of your teaching at Le Moyne.

You can best put the educational philosophy of the College into practice in
your courses by creating a supportive rather than an adversarial environment
for your students. Because many Le Moyne students initially lack intellectual
self-confidence, they respond best to a friendly, open classroom atmosphere
that encourages and supports them as they "learn how to learn." They also need
the requirements for the class to be clearly laid out at the very beginning of
the semester. Once an open, supportive atmosphere is established and students
gain confidence in their ability to do the work for the course, most students
will perform all that you require of them, and often much more. Conversely, an
atmosphere they perceive as hostile or adversarial will cause most of our
students to lose self-confidence and to retreat into silence and non-
participation. In this case, the needs of "the whole person" will not have
been met.

Scholarship enriches your teaching by invigorating you and by keeping you in
touch with the latest work of other scholars in your field. You must strike a
balance between your scholarly activities and your teaching responsibilities,
so that neither one is neglected in favor of the other.

Service is important as well. The Le Moyne College faculty is a community
whose governance requires the college-wide and departmental service of its
members. By serving on committees, task forces, and working groups, you not
only ensure a strong faculty voice in the academic life of the College, but
you also model for your students collegiality at its best.

**2.   Teaching**

1\. What sort of students can you expect in your classes?

> _ * Demographics of the student body_

>

>   * Le Moyne students are a relatively homogeneous group.

>   * In 1997, full-time undergraduate enrollment stood at

>   * 1768.

>   * \--74% of students live on campus.

>   * \--94% are from New York State.

>   * \--65% attended public schools.

>   * \--85% are Catholic, 14% Protestant.

>   * \--59% are male, 41% female.

>   * \--95% require financial aid; many choose the

>   * College because its tuition is relatively

>   * low and it is consistently rated in the top

>   * 100 "Best Buys" among colleges.

>   * \--1997 SAT averages are 536 verbal and 542 Math.

>

>

> _ * Academic preparation and skills_

>

>   * The academic preparation and skills of our students vary widely,
especially among first-year students.   For example, some 40 incoming students
a year place out of ENG 100 (College Writing) because they have met Le Moyne
standards in Advanced Placement or college-level English courses while in high
school.  Another 40 students place into ENG 099 (Introduction to College
Writing) as a result of low scores on diagnostic English tests administered to
all incoming students.

>

>

> _ * Typically, Le Moyne students:_

>

>   * are polite, friendly and generally cooperative

>   * are often reticent in class

>   * lack intellectual self-confidence

>   * require a great deal of individual attention

>   * need guidance to become independent learners

>

2\. If you are teaching a 100-level or 200-level course, you should

  * Expect the "lowest common denominator" to be lower than you think. Who won the American Civil War? What is a sonnet? You cannot presuppose that students know these things.
  * Expect to teach study skills, disciplined work habits, and use of the library.
  * Expect to teach grammar, reading comprehension, and close analysis of texts, regardless of your discipline.
  * Expect to teach techniques for writing papers and taking essay exams.

3\. If you are teaching a 300-level course, you should

  * Expect to continue teaching grammar, reading comprehension, and close analysis of texts, because our students profit from constant reinforcement of these basic skills.
  * Not presume that the course number corresponds to its level of difficulty. Note, for example, that in the English Department, elective courses are **_all_**   numbered from 300-399. Thus Basic Studio Operations (CMM 305) and Advanced Studio Operations (CMM 306) both have numbers in the low 300s.
  * Realize that in an introductory 300-level course, you may need to introduce basic vocabulary, concepts, and practices of the discipline or field, as well as provide elementary-level models, worksheets, and exercises. In some courses, you will literally have to teach students how to turn on the equipment they will be operating during the course.
  * Expect that in more advanced 300-level elective courses, students will be better acquainted with the basics of the discipline and will be more independent as learners. Be sure to discuss the course numbering practices of your department with the department chair.

4\. If you are teaching a 400-level course, you should

  * Expect to be teaching mostly fourth-year students capable of considerable independence if nudged. Writing skills, especially grammatical and analytical skills, still need reinforcement.
  * Realize that while most courses with 400 numbers are fourth-year Core seminars open only to seniors, some 400-level courses are Special Topics courses (elective courses on a special topic, offered occasionally). These courses will enroll the same population as the 300-level electives: third- and fourth-year students, with a few second-year students.

5\. Regardless of the level of course you are teaching, there are things you
can and should do to facilitate student learning and develop your own skills
as a teacher.

  * The Academic Support Center can provide valuable assistance to your students. Be sure to alert them to its existence and refer them to various branches of it as you deem appropriate. Services include the Writing Center, the Mathematics Center, and a variety of services for Learning Disabled students.
  * Talk with your colleagues about teaching, covering everything from the larger issues of teaching philosophy to the mundane concerns of test design and syllabus preparation.
  * Study syllabi from previously-taught sections of your courses. Your department chair has files of syllabi.
  * Create a course syllabus that tells students everything that you will require, including due dates. Go over the syllabus with them on the first day of class.  
\-- Give this syllabus a great deal of thought; it should be more than a
simple checklist.  
\-- Justify each assignment you make, at least to yourself.  
\-- Be rigorous, but reasonable; don't ask the impossible.  
\-- Make each assignment pedagogically worthwhile, and avoid "busy work."

  * Nurture your students' self-confidence, especially in the first few weeks of the semester.
\-- Accentuate the positive by couching criticism in language that does not
destroy self- confidence. Encourage effort.  
\-- Expect to _teach students_   how to make meaningful contributions to class
discussions.  
\-- Never make students feel uncomfortable about asking questions,
particularly at the beginning of the semester. You can establish a positive
tone (or a negative one) in a very short time.  
\-- Ask students to come in for conferences to review tests and papers with
you. **_You_**   must initiate such communication; don't wait for students to
come to you. Just knowing that you are concerned can build a student's
confidence.  
\-- Learn your students' names as quickly as possible. Students at Le Moyne
are individuals, never numbers.  
\-- Develop in-classroom strategies to engender peer respect.  
\-- Develop in-classroom strategies to create student ownership of the
classroom environment.  
\--Help your students understand behaviors that make professors uncomfortable:
failing to show up for appointments, carrying on conversations in class, etc.

  * Be creative! Try to do something stimulating, creative, or just a little bit different in every class session. Assign or encourage creative projects or paper topics or class presentations, thus making students partially responsible for the success of the class.
  * Listen to your students. Indeed, ask your students what problems they are having with the course, and listen to what they say. Monthly course assessments are extremely useful; anonymous written assessments work best.
  * Be flexible. If something isn't working, change it. Sometimes your students will have good suggestions about how to modify an assignment or an aspect of the course to improve student performance.
  * Sit in on colleagues' classes. Talk to your colleagues about teaching; gather ideas and try them out.

**3\. Scholarship**

1\. Le Moyne College is primarily a teaching institution.

  * Excellent teaching is **_always  _** informed about, and by, ongoing scholarship.
  * Such scholarship may take a variety of forms, as outlined in the _Faculty Handbook_.
  * It is expected that some of this research and scholarship will result in refereed publication.
  * Each department has its own expectations or requirements in the area of scholarship.  
\-- Expect your chair to circulate news of conferences, calls for papers, etc.

  * Expectations of scholarly productivity for tenure and promotion are also held by the Committee on Rank and Tenure.  
\-- All faculty possess full rights under the First Amendment which the
process of tenure and promotion may not and does not infringe. No one should
feel that the free expression of opinion within accepted parameters of
collegiality and respect will exercise a negative impact on such decisions.
Feel free to discuss this with your mentor.

  * Neither scholarship nor teaching should be pursued to the exclusion or detriment of the other.

**4\. Service**

1\. Advising Students

  * Know what you're talking about or find someone who does. Remember that the accuracy of the advice you give is very important to the academic progress of your advisees.
  * Act as a guide, not as a parent. Give them information, show them that you care, and leave the rest to them. Reassure them that you'll be there if they need you, but that you aren't going to be looking over their shoulders.
  * Be a good listener, and be attentive to non-verbal communication.
  * Treat your advisees with respect, even if you were not respected in graduate school.
  * * Learn why other departments do what they do. Even the most foolish-looking requirement usually has a reason behind it, and you can't properly advise or advocate for your advisee if you don't understand it.
  * If someone wants your advice about graduate work, ask the student to provide you with an unofficial transcript. You need an accurate portrayal of the student's college career.
  * Refer students with disabilities to the Academic Support Center immediately. The ASC arranges assistance of all kinds for students with physical or learning disabilities.
  * Refer students who need extra help with their writing to the Writing Center. Refer students who need extra help with math to the Math Center.
  * Inform your advisees that the College Catalog for the year in which they entered Le Moyne is a legal document. They and the College are bound by its contents.
  * If you want to learn about major requirements and curricula quickly, apply to serve on the Pre-Law Committee, the Health Professions Advisory Committee, or the Curriculum Committee.
  * Keep your door open. Anything for which the door must be closed doesn't belong in your office. Refer students to the Academic Dean, Counseling Center, or Campus Ministry, as appropriate.
  * Keep away from close personal relationships with advisees. The relationship is by definition fiduciary and unequal.

2\. Faculty are contractually obligated to serve on one committee per year.

  * Participation in **_all_**   forms of service is neither required nor expected.
  * Junior faculty should select carefully from the list below and discuss options with the mentor.

3\. A Service Checklist for Discussion Between Mentor and New Faculty

_____ First-Year advising  
_____ Moderating student activity groups  
_____ Participation in student life activities  
_____ Community service  
_____ Departmental service  
_____ Faculty Senate committee work  
_____ College-wide committee work

**5.   Survival Skills**

1\. What do junior faculty need to know to survive and thrive?

  * The mail room: where it is, how it operates, what is departmental policy on mailings. Obtain mailbox assignment and key in mailroom.
  * Photocopying facilities and the Print Shop: locations and policies. Obtain faculty photocopying card from department chair.
  * See department chair to obtain office key and faculty computing room key.
  * See Security Office to obtain parking sticker for faculty parking lot.
  * Secretarial help and Work/study assistance: what is available, and when.
  * Computer assistance, including use of the VAX for the professor and for class work.
  * Library facilities, including Inter-Library Loan.
  * Bookstore policies and charges.
  * Audio-Visual services.
  * Registrar's Office: Blue books, Scantron forms, chalk, whiteboard markers, grade books.
  * Variable Grading Program for personal computers.
  * Use of Recreation Center.

2\. Remember that Le Moyne is a very small place. Everyone knows everyone
else, and a great deal of departmental business is conducted informally.

  * Expect your teaching life to be an open book.
  * Expect any comments made to a student (in a conference, on a paper, in class, after class, in your office, or in strictest confidence) to be a matter of public record among the student population before nightfall.
  * This means that any exception made for a single student will probably have to be made for all students.

3\. When in doubt, ask questions. Colleagues, support staff, _and_ _students_
will be happy to help.

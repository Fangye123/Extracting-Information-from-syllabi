** ** **MF890: CONTINUOUS-TIME MODELS IN FINANCE**

This course will provide an introduction to the use of continuous-time models
in finance. Although we will use continuous-time models, emphasis will be on
the economics of the problems studied rather than on the mathematics. You will
find that the assigned readings are highly technical and difficult. I expect
that you will read them anyway with a view toward two questions: first, what
economic insight is contained in the article, and second, abstracting from
difficult mathematical issues, how is the model set up and solved? You should
view this course as an introduction to the use of continuous-time models to
answer interesting questions in finance.

**Text**

The two assigned texts are:

John Hull, _Options, Futures, and other Derivative Securities_ 3rd ed.,
Prentice-Hall, 1996

David Shimko, _Finance in Continuous Time: A Primer_ , Kolb Publishing, 1992



Another more difficult, but more complete text is:

Jonathan Ingersoll, _Theory of Financial Decision Making_ , Rowman and
Littlefield, 1987.

The following is a compilation of many of the classic articles in the field:

Robert C. Merton, _Continuous-Time Finance_ , Basil Blackwell, 1990.

Course Requirements

Assigned problem sets will be graded (40% of the grade), and there will be a
final exam (60%). You are responsible for readings marked with a *. These
articles are in the reading packet, available in the bookstore.

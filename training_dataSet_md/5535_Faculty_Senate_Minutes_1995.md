**Social Science Curriculum Committee** Meeting Minutes November 9, 1995

The Social Science Curriculum Committee met at 3:00 p.m. on thursday, November
9, 1995. Members present include: Brady, Geiger, Haferkamp, Kruse, Risser,
Suliman, and Suziedelis (for Fischel).  

1\. Dr. David Risser was unanimously elected to be the committee's convener.  

2\. A discussion on whether people presenting or supporting proposals to the
committee should be present during discussions and voting of the committee on
their proposals followed. A consensus was reached that the committee will
discuss proposals and vote in committee and with noncommittee people not in
attendance.  

3\. The African American Studies minor proposal. Discussion centered on the
appropriateness of wording in the proposal referring to independent study
credit. Because of budget considerations, requiring independent study may not
be feasible for all minors. A Brady/Risser motion to approve the proposal if
all references to independent study are removed from the proposal was adopted
unanimously.  

4\. PSYC 336, Psychology of Human Adjustment. A Risser/Geiger motion to
approve PSYC 336 as a writing (w) course was adopted unanimously.  

5\. EDW 5--, Geography Education Tools and Skills (K-12). A Geiger/Risser
motion to approve EDW 5--, as a workshop for high school teachers to be taught
during summer 1996 was adopted unanimously.  

6\. Program change for Geography Majors. A Suliman/Riusser motion to require
all students to earn a grade of "C" or higher in all of their Geography
courses to graduate with a BA or BSE degree in Geography was adopted
unanimously.  

7\. ECON 327, Women and global Economic Development. This course was approved
by the Economics Department on November 15, 1991; the Social Sciences
Curriculum Committee on April 14, 1992; and the Undergraduate Curriculum and
program Review Committee on April 25, 1995. A Geiger/Risser motion to release
ECON 327 from the moratorium on the approval of new courses for general
education credit was adopted unanimously.  

8\. Change in the number of BUAD 301, Legal Environment of Business. A
BRady/Risser motion to change the number of BUAD 301 to BUAD 202 was adopted
unanimously as a minor change needing no further approval.

**RE:** | |  | **ECON 327, Women and Global Economic Development**  
| |  |  
DATE: | |  | November 8, 1995  
  
The above course was approved by the Faculty Senate at their second meeting in
September 1995. Concurrently, the President put a moratorium on all courses
since the beginning of the Fall Semester, 1995. In other words, the above
course cannot be taught unless special permission is granted by the President.
At the Faculty Senate meeting held on November 7, 1995, the Provost was
approached to grant permission to include the above course in the Economic
Department's offerings. The justification is as follows:  

A. This course is an integral part of the Women's Studies minor program.

B. I attended the workshop to develop perspectives in Women's Studies early in
the 1990's.

C. It took almost three years for me to develop the course and have it
approved by the Faculty Senate.

D. I will be retiring at the end of the Fall Semester, 1995. The Department
has advertised to fill my position. The advertisement calls for specialty in
Women's Studies. (See Attachment A.)

If the University wants a strong Women's Studies minor program inclusion of
ECON 327 is most important. The Provost mentioned that in order to have this
course released from the moratorium, such a request hads to go through the
respective channels.  

Hence, I am requesting the Curriculum Committee approve my request to release
this course. If approved, this request may be sent to the Undergraduate Course
and Program Review Committee for their approval. Thank you.

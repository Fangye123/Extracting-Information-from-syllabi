**Description**  
  
This PhD seminar is the first in a two-course sequence on theoretical and
analytical approaches in international relations. In this course we survey
twentieth-century debates through about the mid-1970s, with a few exceptions;
contempory IR theory and analysis ("neo-" to "post-") is covered in SIS-703.
Although many of the works you will read during the semester are considered
classics, this is not a course on "classical" international theory (ancient,
mideaval, rennaissance, etc.). Nor will you encounter works whose impact is
evident primarily outside the Western tradition of international relations
scholarship (e.g., Eastern or Islamic schools of thought). This is very much a
survey of the modern Anglo-American discipline of international relations,
including some works by non-Anglo-American writers that have had a lasting
impact on the discipline.  
  
The first half of the course covers scholarship representative of three
theoretical traditions in international relations: realism, liberalism, and
radicalism. We then pause to consider some analytical and epistemological
issues relevant to IR theory. After that we turn to some of the main
approaches to foreign-policy analysis, and lastly we take up normative
international theory. The organization of the material is both thematic and
chronological -- thematic in that each week's reading and discussion will
focus on a particular perspective, tradition, or approach in international
relations; chronological in that competing approaches have often unfolded in
critical response to scholarship of the previous generation.  
  
  
**Readings**  
  
All required readings have been placed on two-hour [
reserve](http://www.aladin.wrlc.org:8000/cgi-
bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?PAGE=rbSearch&SEQ=20010825112205&PID=17810) at the
university library. I leave it to you to purchase books from your preferred
source and according to your interests and pocketbook. Many of the assigned
readings are still in print and others can be located online through a network
of rare and used book sellers (e.g.,
[bibliofind](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/subst/books/misc/bibliofind.html/)).  
  
In this course we will not be using a text that reviews or integrates the
theoretical literature in international relations, but a handful of such texts
do exist and you might find one or more of them helpful after your initial
exposure to the literature (while preparing for your comprehensives, perhaps).
James E. Dougherty and Robert L. Pfaltzgraff provide probably the most
comprehensive survey in their _Contending Theories of International Relations_
(1997). Fairly sophisticated introductory discussions of the main theoretical
traditions as well as contemporary approaches can be found in Scott Burchill,
Andrew Linklater, et al., _Theories of International Relations_ (1996). In
_Political Theories of International Relations_ (1998), David Boucher grounds
his discussion of modern IR theory in landmark works of political philosophy
and theory, as does Michael W. Doyle in his _Ways of War and Peace: Realism,
Liberalism, and Socialism_ (1997). For a historical overview of the field's
development, see Torbj orn L. Knutsen, _A History of International Relations
Theory_ (1992).  
  
  
**Requirements and Evaluation**  
  
In addition to your active involvement in seminar discussion (25% of your
course grade), you will be asked to write a 6-7 page book review (25%) and a
12-15 page take-home final exam (50%). Books for review should be selected
from the list at the end of the syllabus, although I am happy to consider
alternative book assignments.

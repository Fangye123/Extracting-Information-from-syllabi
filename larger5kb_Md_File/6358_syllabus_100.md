**COURSE OBJECTIVES**

This course is designed to help students better understand eight of the most
significant American novels written before 1900 in terms of their historical
contexts as well as subsequent critical controversies. Another objective is to
develop students' close reading and critical thinking skills and to improve
students' ability to express themselves through speaking and writing.

2\. **Attendance and participation** are requirements of this course. If you
miss more than three classes, I will deduct two points from your final grade
for each additional class you miss. (For example, if you miss five classes and
your numerical grade for the course is an 81, it would turn into a 77.) For
the purposes of grading (lateness of papers, class participation, in-class
writing) I do not distinguish between excused and unexcused absences. I will
give between six and ten quizzes over the course of the semester; in most
cases they cannot be made up.  


3\. **Short papers and presentations:** By the third day of class I will give
you a schedule for presentations and paper due dates. You will write two
reviews of scholarly articles or chapters and two q-h-q's.

Reviews of scholarly articles should consist of about 500 words of careful
summary followed by 150-250 words of evaluation. I will provide more advice in
class; I have also placed information on summary writing on reserve. The
articles will either be in the required edition of the novel under
consideration or on reserve in the library.

Q-H-Q stands for Question-Hypothesis-Question. First you pose an issue
question (not a question of fact) regarding the assigned reading for that day.
Then you write a brief essay (about 500-750 words) to support a hypothesis in
response to that question. Finally, you present another issue question
suggested by your hypothesis. The Q-H-Q requires no outside research. It is
not a report--it is an original, thoughtful response to what you've read.

On one of the two days you're scheduled to turn in a review of a scholarly
article, you will also give a brief oral presentation of your review to the
class (5-10 minutes). You will do the same with one of your Q-H-Q's. The
presentation is worth 10 points (the equivalent of about two quizzes).  


4\. **Criteria for graded writing** : I look primarily for **content**
(evidence of original thinking, sufficient detail, use of outside sources when
appropriate) and **development** (logical organization of sentences into
paragraphs and paragraphs into a coherent essay). Next I am concerned with the
**clarity** of your sentences and your **ability to vary sentence structures**
, and on the **mechanical correctness** of your writing.

***Late penalty: one letter grade for each class period an essay is late. I
will not accept any written work after May 3.***

On a 100-pt. scale, A = 91-100, B+ = 87-90, B = 81-86, C+ = 77-80, C = 71-76,  
D = 65-70, and an F = 64 or lower.

5\. **Improving** : If you want to improve your grade(s), talk to me about how
you can write better essays or perform better on exams and presentations:
that's what I'm here for. However, I will not allow you to retake an exam,
rewrite a paper, or do an additional assignment for extra credit.

### Course Description:

    How and why have archaeologists sought out the past?           In many ways, the field of archaeology began with moments of discovery in the Mediterranean and the exploration of the ancient civilizations of Greece, Rome, Egypt and Western Asia. This course will follow archaeology as it has developed in this part of the world, focusing on key advances and famous discoveries such as the investigation of Pompeii and Herculaneum, Napoleon's exploration of Egypt, the pursuit of Troy, Mycenae, and the Trojan War, and the tomb of Tutankhamun. The course will also discuss the growth of scientific archaeology in the latter half of the 20th century and the goals and methods of current archaeological research projects.       For each of these moments we will look at contemporary events, excavator's field notes, and the popular reception of archaeological discoveries. We will see how archaeology has changed during the last 250 years, and how wealthy aristocrats, colonial officials, nationalist causes, textual traditions, collectors of art, and scientific advances have all influenced the field. The history of this discipline, the men and women behind it, and the progress made will be chronicled, as we explore the scholarly, political, and cultural dynamics surrounding archaeological investigation in our discussions. As the course progresses, students will not only have gained knowledge of the history of archaeology, but also be able to re-evaluate their idea of a "great discovery".

### Required Texts:

P. Bahn, The Cambridge illustrated history of archaeology (Cambridge 1996).

B. Fagan, Eyewitness to discovery: first-person accounts of more than 50 of
the world's greatest archaeological discoveries (Oxford 1996).

E. Peters, The crocodile on the sandbank (Mysterious Press 1975).

Note: There is a substantial amount of reserve reading assigned for this
class. Students should consult the supplemental [List of Reserve
Readings](Reserve.html) in addition to this syllabus. You may read or xerox
these readings at the library, or you may borrow on short-term loan a binder
with all the reserve readings from the instructor and xerox them for yourself.

### Course Policies:

1) Attendance is mandatory and will be recorded. Excessive absences will lower
your participation grade; more than five unexcused absences will prompt the
instructor to contact your academic advisor or dean. It is critical that you
attend class in order to master the course material. You will, however, be
excused for religious obligations, or medical, personal, and family
emergencies if you notify the instructor.

2) Readings, both from textbooks and on reserve, are required and essential
for making the "Great Discoveries" in this class. It is important for you to
complete the reading prior to the lecture for which they are assigned, so that
you will be an informed and intelligent member of the audience. Your
participation in the class is encouraged every day, and is critical during
"discussion sections" indicated on the syllabus, when we will consider
particularly interesting ethical issues involving archaeological discoveries.

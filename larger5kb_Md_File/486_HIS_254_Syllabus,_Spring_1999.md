## Syllabus for HIS254, Spring 1999

#### This course is a survey of the social institutions, value systems and
political organization of Sub-Saharan Africa since the 16th century but with
particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries. Successful completion of
this course satisfies the Cross-Cultural Requirement for the
[U.K.](http://www.uky.edu) University Studies Program because it emphasizes
how non-Western civilizations reflect values and systems of thought which
depart from our traditional ways of thinking.

#### Class Format and Grading:

This class is set up primarily with a seminar-type format: the instructor is
not the primary lecturer. The topics under consideration will follow the units
of African history listed in the course outline, but each day's agenda will be
determined by class consensus. You are encouraged to bring in guest lecturers
and appropriate artifacts to share in discussions and you will be expected to
incorporate the information into your coursework. In addition, you will choose
to be a part of a "home team": this team should help you study and they will
expect you to prepare well for the team exam days. This class is not confined
to a physical classroom nor scheduled class times, but continues on the Web
(see the address above) so that you can learn when you are ready to learn
best. Your grade will be calculated on a 100-point scale, where A = 90-100, B
= 80-89, C = 70-79, D = 60-69, and E = 59 & below. To succeed, you will
fulfill the following requirements:

2 Team Exams (midterm and final)| 50 points  
---|---  
Nation Case Study| 25 points  
Topic Essay on the Novels (due April 2)| 15 points  
Class Attendance and Participation | 10 points  
  
  * **2 Team Exams:** Both exams will consist of objective type questions to be discussed by your home team and answered as a group during the classtime allotted. The midterm will count for 20 points and the comprehensive final will count for 30 points.
  *  **Class Participation:** Participation in class discussions will be assessed. All students are expected to attend all classes due to the discussion nature of the course. More than three unexcused absences will lower your final grade 10 points. An excused absence is one in which you have contacted me beforehand and made alternative arrangements for what you have missed. You are responsible for officially withdrawing before midterm (March 12th) if attendance becomes problematic.
  *  **Nation Case Study:** You will be expected to contribute constructively to your team's presentation and discussion of issues in a chapter in the Global Studies: Africa text. Each home team will lead the class in a nation case study discussion after a formal presentation. The opportunity to receive full points will be allotted only to those teams who actively engage the class in discussion. I am happy to help you plan in advance how to engage your peers in discussion. This is a team effort, and if you are unsure how your team will perform you should contact me in advance to talk this over.
  *  **Topic Essay:** The two required novels have many common themes and topics on which to base your reflective essay. This essay is an individual effort, however I expect you to show how you have learned from your colleagues and class discussions how complex your chosen topic can be. You should write a 5-8 page essay (typed), turn in a rough draft no later than March 26 (after Spring Break), and final draft no later than Friday, April 2nd, 4:30 p.m. in my mailbox in Moloney Blg 226.

####  Policy On Attendance, Withdrawals, And Incompletes:

Regular class attendance is expected, and will be measured by your home team.
Mere physical attendance is important, however, your team will also decide on
the quality of your participation in order to determine whether or not to
continue including you in the group. Therefore it is your **prepared**
attendance which is a valuable part of this course. You may withdraw from this
class on your own at any time before midterm, but after that date you will not
be allowed to withdraw (except for non-academic related emergencies) because
your team will be relying on you. Incompletes are given only in emergencies
and only when there is a minor amount of the course left to complete. For you
to receive an "I" grade, you must submit a written contract on how you plan to
make up the work, and this contract must be signed by me, my department chair
and the Dean of Academic Affairs before the last day of classes.

#### Cheating/Plagiarism:

Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated, and any infringement of the
L.C.C. Student Code will be dealt with swiftly and completely. The first
offence will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question; and you will
not be allowed to submit any further work without a conference with me during
which you show me a draft of your work. The second offence will deserve a more
public hearing by the Division Chair and Ombud. If you are not sure what
plagiarism is, please read the Student Code and listen to the audiotape
"Slaying the Plagiarism Dragon" by Dr. Patricia C. Kuett, found in the L.C.C.
Library A-V shelves under the call number PN/167/K83.

#### Policy On Late Work:

Keeping up-to-date with each requirement is your responsibility. If you miss a
class or any specified deadline, you MUST contact me in advance, but if you
wish to receive credit for a scheduled assignment, you must first negotiate
with me to find an acceptable compromise deadline. You will not be allowed to
make up for a responsibility you have in this class unless you have
communicated with me and made alternative arrangements before the deadline.

####  Assumptions and Guidelines for Discussions

For the purpose of our discussions in this course we agree that:

  * We are all teachers and learners since we all have multiple identities (including but not limited to those based on our race, gender, age, class, sexual orientation, ethnicity, abilities, region, appearances, talents). 
  * Societies construct meanings of gender, race, place, time, etc. 
  * Oppression (i.e., racism, sexism, classism, heterosexism) exists. 
  * One of the mechanisms of oppression is that we are all systematically taught misinformation about our own groups and about members of both dominant and subordinate groups. 
  * We will not blame ourselves or others for the misinformation we have learned in the past, but accept responsibility for not repeating misinformation after we have learned otherwise. 
  * We will not blame victims for their oppression. 
  * People (both the groups we study and the members of our class) always do the best they can. 
  * We will actively pursue information about our own groups and those of others. 
  * We will share information about our groups with other members of the class and never demean, devalue, or in any way "put down" people for their experience. 
  * We will actively combat the myths and stereotypes about our own groups and other groups so that we can break down the walls that prohibit group cooperation and group gain. 
  * If members of the class wish to make comments that they do not want repeated outside the classroom, they can preface their remarks with a request and the class will agree not to repeat the remarks. This will help to create a safe atmosphere for open discussion.

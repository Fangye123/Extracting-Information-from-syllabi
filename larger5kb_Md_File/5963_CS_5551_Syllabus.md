**Bulletin Description:  
** Introduction to major topics: handling input data, menus, user feedback,
command-line systems, window systems, interface management systems, use of
color, help systems, error handling and avoidance, and design for users with
disabilities.

**Prerequisites:  
** Quarter prerequisite: CS 3620, Math 3320 or #, Semester prerequisite: CS
2511, Math 1297 or #, or the equivalent if you are a transfer student.
**Important note:** The computer science bachelor's degree program at UMD is
accredited by CAC (the Computing Accreditation Commission). One of the CAC
requirements is that all students _must_ satisfy the prerequisites in order to
be admitted to a course, so if you have not passed the prerequisite courses,
you must drop this course (if you have any questions about this, please see
the instructor after the lecture or during office hours).

Also, the software that we will be using for this course requires that all
programs be written in C or C++

**Course Objectives and Content:  
** This course provides an introduction to the theory and practice of
designing a user interface to an application program. The following is a rough
outline of the material that I hope to cover in the course. From the
theoretical point of view, we will cover general principles, theories, and
guidelines of interface development, software tools, direct manipulation and
virtual environments, multiple-window strategies, and information search and
visualization. On the practical side, we will discuss and program with the X
Window System, including the X resource manager, using widgets (manager
widgets, menus, dialogs), handling events, using color, graphics contexts,
handling graphics images, text, and using the X graphics primitives.

**Equal Opportunity:  
** The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons
shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without
regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital
status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual
orientation. As instructor, I am committed to upholding University of
Minnesota's equal opportunity policy. I encourage you to talk to me in private
about any concerns you have related to equal opportunity in the classroom. To
inquire further about the University's policy on equal opportunity, contact
the Office of Equal Opportunity, 255 DAdB, [

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have any disability (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect your ability to perform in this class, please inform me at the start of
the quarter. I may adapt methods, materials, or testing so that you can
participate equitably. To learn about the services that UMD provides to
students with disabilities, contact the Access Center/Disability Services 138

**Texts:**

  1. Douglas A. Young, _X Window Systems Programming and Applications with Xt, OSF Motif Edition, Second Edition,_ P T R Prentice Hall, Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1994, ISBN 0-13-123803-5. 
  2. Ben Shneiderman, _Designing the User Interface, Third Edition,_ Addison Wesley Longman, Inc., Reading, Massachusetts, 1998, ISBN 0-201-69497-2. 

**Course Requirements:  
** You are responsible for reading assigned text material and for material
covered in class, including:

  1. doing the reading assignments from the text 
  2. the material covered in the lectures 
  3. obtaining assignments and handouts 
  4. turning in programming assignments and homework  

If you are unable to attend a class meeting, it is your responsibility to
obtain class notes, assignments, and extra copies of handouts from your study
partner. **Note:** all assignments are due at the _beginning_ of class on the
due date (unless otherwise specified) -- they will be docked 25% per day if
turned in late.

**Assignments and the Course Directory:  
**

As mentioned above, all the programs in this course will be using the X Window
System, and so must be written in C or C++. The programming assignments should
adhere to the [ Computer Science Lab Report
Format](assignments/labinfo/labformat.html).  Initial versions of programs,
makefiles, and libraries will be maintained in the Course Directory:
**`/opt/local/studata/COURSES/cs5551`**  
There is a **README** file in that directory that explains what is in the
files and subdirectories.

**Examinations and Grading:  
**

There will be a midterm exam, worth 100 points and a final exam worth 200
points. These exams are closed book.  The final exam will be comprehensive.
Exams will _not_ be given early, and makeups must be justified by dire
circumstances described to the instructor _before_ the time of the exam. It is
Department of Computer Science policy not to return final exams, however they
are kept and you can look at your exam in the instructor's office. The section
**Final Examination Conflicts** on the [ Final Examination
Policy](http://www.d.umn.edu/catalogs/current/umd/gen/final.html) web page
explains the UMD policy about having more than two final exams on a single
day.

### Exam Schedule:

**Exam**|  **Points**|  **Date and Time  
---|---|---  
Midterm Exam |  100 points  |  Monday, March 11, 1-1:50 p.m. in HH 302  
Final Exam |  200 points  |  Monday, May 13, 12-1:55 p.m. in HH 302  
  
Scores and total points will be posted periodically on the "` Grades`" page of
the class web site:  
[
http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs5551/grades](http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs5551/grades)  
using the last digits of your student id number. If you wish to have your
scores posted using a number other than the last digits of your student id,
you may email your request to the instructor.

**Grading Procedures:** Final grades are based on total points distributed
approximately as follows:

  * Labs and homework assignments (approx. 300 points) 
  * Midterm Exam (100 points) 
  * Final Examination (200 points) 
Grades are assigned based on a percentage of the total points.

  * The A- cutoff is 90% 
  * The B- cutoff is 80% 
  * The C- cutoff is 70% 
  * The D cutoff is 60% 
  * Below 60% is an F 
These percentages may be lowered slightly but they will not be raised.  
**Important note:** In the past, students have tended to do better on the lab
and homework assignments (average = 99%) than on the midterm (80%) and final
(86%) exams. Thus class averages going into the final exam tend to be higher
than after the final exam. This leads to the following two pieces of advice:
(1) keep your average as high as possible by doing well on the lab/homework
assignments, and (2) study carefully for the exams, using the review sheets,
so that your average isn't brought down by poor exam scores.

COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES: HI 100EA surveys world history from the
origin of civilization to around 1200 CE. The course emphasizes doing history
by introducing students to primary sources--works produced at the time under
study--and the methods historians employ to interpret them; this will be
supplemented by lectures and text material that demonstrate how historians
shape material into historical narratives and arrive at interpretations of the
past. Students will be taught how to think historically as well as learning
the broad outlines of world history and the basic information about the
period. The course also addresses requirements for general education by
developing students' abilities in reading intelligently, writing effectively,
and processing information. (Hand-outs prepared by the history department
covering each of these skills will be handed out with this syllabus.) These
skills will be developed in part through direct encounters with primary
sources, with some lectures employed to acquaint students with the methods
with which historians deal with such sources. Lectures and text readings will
also augment students' reading and interpretive abilities. Reading and writing
skills will also be developed and assessed through both take-home and in-class
tests, as discussed below.  


COURSE REQUIREMENTS: The required text for HI 100EA is Richard W. Bulliet, et
al., _The Earth and Its Peoples_ , vol. A, Second Edition. Students will also
be required to read three primary source selections through the course of the
semester, from choices indicated on the syllabus or choices of their own
approved by the professor. These will be available at the library reserve and
at the professor's office, and some are also available on internet sites;
students will not have to purchase additional texts.

The syllabus indicates a range of primary sources. Students do not have to
read all of them. Students will select one of the suggested primary sources
for each test period (three over the course of the semester), or they will
select alternative primary sources of their own, subject to the professor's
approval. This allows students to tailor their readings to their specific
interests; the professor's selections are designed to give students a sense of
the range of possibilities in terms of thematic focus, genre, and area of the
world. Lectures will provide students with some assistance in how to read and
interpret primary sources.

The three hour examinations will each have both in-class and take-home
components. The in-class examinations will consist of short identification
questions and essay questions; they will cover material in lectures and
assigned text readings. Students are expected to provide blue books for the
in-class portions of tests; these are available at the Washburn Bookstore. The
take-home portion of the test will consist of a longer (3-5 page, typed) essay
question concerning the primary source the student has chosen. Questions will
be designed both to ensure that the students have actually read the primary
sources they have selected and to make them connect their reading of the
primary source with other knowledge (from text and lectures) of the period and
place in which it was composed. For the first two tests, questions for the
take-home portion will be available at the review session preceding the in-
class test, and the essays will be due the class following the in-class
examination, at the beginning of class. For the final, the take-home portion
will be due on the last day of class. The final examination will not be
comprehensive, covering only material covered after the second examination.

In-class and take-home portions of tests will each be graded on a 100 point
scale. On in-class tests, identification will be worth 20 points (4 points per
identification), and essays will be worth 40 points each. Take-home portions
of the test will also be worth 100 points. The final grade will consist of an
average of these scores. Active class participation will be taken into account
as a positive factor in borderline cases or, at the discretion of the
professor, to raise grades up to one level higher when participation seems to
indicate that the student has a better grasp of material than test averages
indicate. Evidence of cheating on in-class tests or plagiarism on take-home
portions of the tests will result in automatic failure. What plagiarism
consists of and how to avoid it in writing assignments will be discussed in
class before the first test.

Students who are having difficulties with either the reading or writing
demands of the class should avail themselves of assistance from departmental
tutors or from the English Department's Writing Center (Morgan 257). Students
having trouble with the material should also meet with the professor during
scheduled office hours (or by appointment).

Students with disabilities may identify themselves voluntarily to the Services
for Students with Disabilities Office (SSWDO) to request accommodations. The
office is responsible for assisting in arranging accommodations (including in-
class notetakers, test readers and/or scribes, adaptive computer technology,
and brailled materials) and for identifying resources on campus. New requests
for accommodations should be submitted two months or more prior to the date
services should begin; however, check with the SSWDO office as soon as a need
may arise. The SSWDO office is at Morgan Hall 150; their phone number is
(785)231-1010 ext. 1629. Students may also voluntarily identify themselves to
the instructor to discuss accommodations.

Class attendance is not required. Students should be aware, however, that
lecture material will not duplicate text readings, and students will be
responsible for lecture material on tests. And, obviously, routine absence
will prevent active class participation. Students who miss scheduled tests or
due dates for take-home test portions will be required to provide valid
excuses for their absence.

**SYLLABUS**  
Fiction of Iran and Central Asia (in Translation)  
CAS 3601/5601; MELC 3601/5601

Conceptual Frame:

This course deals with oppression both in its domestic mode and in the modes
by which the industrial world (the West and the Soviet Union) exploits the
human and natural resources of the region between the Persian Gulf and Tibet.
Rather than directly, as would a course in the Political Science Department,
this course examines the dynamics of oppression in urban and rural centers as
these are portrayed by the writers of fiction native to the area. The course
specifically deals with political oppression, especially as it applies to
women.

Objectives:

  * Acquaint students with cultures other than their own.   

  * Show students that oppression, unless "institutionalized," does not recognize race, gender, class, and nationality boundaries; furthermore, that oppression is experienced differently depending on one's sex, social status, and political leaning.   

  * Allow students to view the West and the US through the eyes of the peoples from other cultures.   

  * Teach students that different cultures have different values and, consequently, different issues to tackle; what is a major issue in one  culture might not necessarily be an issue in another.   

  * Allow students to observe situations in cultural context and analyze and assess the impact of their dynamics using the values of the same culture.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
This course is designed to add to the social and cultural dimensions of your
work in Honors 122. In this course, we will use semiotics (the study of signs
and symbols) to "read" 19th. and 20th. century North-American culture.
Employed in cultural studies (an interdisciplinary field using, in particular,
sociology, literature, anthropology, psychology, history and philosophy), the
semiotic method can teach us to formulate arguments about the nature of the
world in which we live. As the editors of _Signs of Life_ pointed out,  "one
of its precepts is that its job is to reveal interests and ideologies, not to
_judge_ them." This latter undertaking is difficult and the encouragement to
be more self-conscious about our opinions and points of view can sometimes
seem to be intrusive. But we must remember that the goal of our study in this
class is to try to understand our contemporary beliefs and desires "within a
social and cultural context." We will see how movies, rituals, advertising,
and social institutions both reflect and shape our own experiences. In
particular, we will consider social signs and symbols to raise historical and
economic issues as we seek to describe and analyze the world we live in.  
REQUIRED READINGS:  
L. Frank Baum, _The Wonderful Wizard of Oz_ (ill. Lisbeth Zwerger, 1900/1996);

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
1\. Four formal papers (two short -- 3-4 pages; two slightly longer -- 5-6
pages);  
2\. 8 micro-analyses -- 2-3 pages. These will first be marked with suggestions
for improvement on content, structure, project... Then you will correct the
essay using the teacher's suggestions and you will return it for a final
grade.  
3\. final group project and presentation;  
4\. other requirements: regular attendance (including movies); readings and
assignments done on time; ACTIVE class and group participation; 2 individual
conferences to discuss your work and scheduled by the teacher during both
parts of the semester.  
GRADING:  
1\. formal papers: 10% 10% 15% 15%  
2\. micro-analyses: 30%  
3\. group presentation: 10%  
4\. other requirements: 10%  
GRADING POLICIES/STANDARDS:  
We use pluses and minuses as indicated below (A-, B+, B-, and C+). Good papers
will include statements supported by examples and evidences from relevant
readings. Written work will be graded on grammar, content, style, organization
and clarity. Spellcheck and proofread all papers before submitting them.  
A: 93-100; A-: 90-92: this is awarded for superior understanding of all
concepts, for impressive presentation in written work, sophisticated
interpretation and style, imaginative projects that go beyond the assignment,
and insightful class participation. For surprising me!  
B+: 87-89; B: 83-86; B-: 80-82: this indicates above average mastery of the
material, clear, well-produced and thoughtful written presentation.  
C+:77-79; C: 70-76: this is for average or adequate mastery of the material,
understanding of factual material, and just competent written presentation.  
D: 60-69: this suggests less than satisfactory preparation of factual
material, and poor written work--minimum effort and writing problems requiring
follow-up from a writing center tutor;  
F: 59 and below: unacceptable as college level work, with serious writing
problems requiring intensive help.  
0: work not handed in on time (contact me before due date with serious
problems).  
CLASS POLICIES:  
_Attendance:_ It is the stated policy of the university that "students are
expected to attend class periods of the courses for which they register."
Because of the direct intellectual engagement required by the material,
regular, _punctual_ attendance is essential. This class is designed as a
community of learners, and because of the nature of our group interactions,
each one of you has a responsibility to your fellow students to attend
classes. Poor attendance by students undermines the work of the whole; be
courteous, prompt, and save absences for illness only. Students who miss
classes and are not prepared should not have unreasonable expectations about
their final grade.  
_Academic honesty_ : Academic honesty is expected. The GMU Honor Code is found
in the University Catalog and applies to this and all other courses. Cheating,
plagiarism are expressly forbidden. For quick reference, plagiarism can be
defined as (1) presenting as one's own the words, work, or opinions of someone
else without proper acknowledgement or (2) borrowing the sequence of ideas,
the arrangement of material, or the pattern of thought of someone else without
proper acknowledgement. A serious academic offense, plagiarism is grounds for
failing at least the assignment if not the course. Your work must be your own
new work, done for this course alone.  
_Style_ :  
All out-of-class assignments must be typed, double-spaced with one-inch
margins and must include a header in the upper, right-hand corner of the first
page. The header must include your name, the date, the class number and
section, and the assignment title and/or number. All pages but the first must
be numbered and the paper stapled. Do not use a cover sheet. Font size should
not be larger than 12 points. Consistently following the basic style is part
of the grade.  
_Paper submission/late policy:_  
All papers are due at the beginning of class, on the assigned date. Papers
left in my mailbox, papers handed in at the end of class or later that day,
are late papers. In cases of illness/serious emergencies (justified by a
doctor's note or appropriate printed documents) contact me prior to the
assignment date (or as soon as possible). I make these policies so that all
students are treated equally. Also because the class is large and the writing
and rewriting is substantial, I need to have your papers so I can get them
graded promptly. NO PAPER ACCEPTED AFTER THE LAST DAY OF CLASS, DECEMBER 9,
1999.  
_Exam and oral presentation policy_ : since your oral presentation is part of
a group project, it cannot be rescheduled and if you miss the oral
presentation, you will receive an F for the missed presentation (10% of
grade).  
\- In-class written work can only be rescheduled if a medical note is provided
upon your return to class.  
  
NOTE: We may not get to discuss all the material on the syllabus, but if it is
in the syllabus, you are responsible for it. Please always bring to class the
assigned readings and the syllabus.  
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR HIGH GRADES:  
1\. Keep up with the schedule for readings and assignments and come to class
prepared;  
2\. It is expected that your papers, journals, quizzes and exam will be
written in full, well thought-out sentences, with a natural and progressive
flow of ideas. Your written work will be graded on style, grammar, content,
organization, and clarity. Good papers will always have statements supported
by examples from relevant readings;  
3\. Spelling and punctuation count for each grade. You may want to spellcheck,
and to refer to Hacker's _A Writer's Reference_ and Booth's _The Craft of
Research_ (or use the Writing Center at GMU, a classmate or a friend);  
4\. Because of the participatory nature of this course, any absence will
affect your grade;  
5\. All work submitted must be originally produced by you. Sources used (if
any) must be documented. Deviation from this constitutes a violation of the
GMU Honor Code;  
6\. Computer failure is not a valid excuse for late work; always save your
work as you proceed;  
7\. Do keep a hard copy of any work you turn in; check diskettes often for
viruses;  
8\. Use printed texts and not only the internet for your research;  
9\. Become a curious learner engaged in the pursuit of intellectual
challenges. As Solomon states  "Semiotics never tells you what to think, only
how to think and how to probe beneath the surface" (13). Become a
"professional prober" and question the culture(s) that surround(s) you for a
better understanding of your own ideological stands.  
10\. Enjoy the class!  
WRITING ACROSS THE CURRICULUM  
In the Honors program, students complete a variety of writing assignments
throughout the program. You will be writing formal essays (at least one which
will be revised and discussed in individual conference), responses to some
assigned readings, and some impromptu class writing. Writing is an essential
component of this class and will be given serious attention. The writing in
this course contributes to the 6-hour composition requirement.  
COURSE SCHEDULE (FALL 1999) HONORS 121

sequence of events are _subject to change_ to maintain the coordination with

changes in the schedule. TAKE 3 PHONE NUMBERS ON THE FIRST DAY OF CLASS. email

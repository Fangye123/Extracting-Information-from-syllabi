the beginning of the class when the book is to be discussed.  Students should
bring two copies of their completed book worksheet.  They should be typed,
double-spaced, arial font, one inch margins, and in 12 pitch.  Students who

Class attendance will directly affect your grade.  A sign-in sheet will be
distributed each day.  It is the responsibility of each student to attend
class, take notes and participate in class discussions. Your performance is
guaranteed to improve with regular attendance and adequate preparation for
class.**

>

> **Class:**

>

>> **I encourage students to ask questions and to discuss issues in class.
If, however, anystudent or students persist in carrying on a discussion with
others or disrupting the class in any way I will ask that student or students
to leave.  We are all here at Sam Houston to learn and one student's
discussion may prevent another from being able to hear the class lecture.  If
you have a question or you missed a word that I said or do not know how to
spell a word, please raise your hand and ask me.  I do not mind answering any
questions or repeating a sentence or word.  Please do not ask your neighbors
because they may be trying to take notes.**

  * **Quiz and Homework Policies:** The homework and quizzes are designed to help you master the material in each chapter. You should read the chapter, working the in-chapter problems and assigned end-of-the-chapterproblems. You can check your work with the Student Solution Manual. Then do the online homework using WebCT. These are generally multiple choice or short answer questions. Homework is due by midnight on the dates indicated on the schedule. After that time, the site goes down and you will not be able to access the homework. Quizzes are scheduled every two weeks and are due by 10:00 am on the Saturdays indicated on the schedule. Quiz questions will be posted on the Web or will be sent to you electronically through CyberClass. You have three ways to submit the quizzes: 1) bring the quiz to campus and turn it to Professor Schoffstall in Science Building Room 241; 2) You may mail the quiz to campus: Professor Schoffstall, UCCS, P. O. Box 7150, Colorado Springs, CO 80933-7150 (Note: Since there is no mail delivery on Saturday, your quiz must arrive by the Friday, the day before.); 3) You may FAX the quiz to Professor Schoffstall (FAX Number: 719-262-3047); or 4) You may submit the quiz electronically. To do so, open the file using Word or other word processing program. Then use ChemDraw or other chemistry structure drawing program to draw structures, write reactions, and give products.Copy the drawings into the Word document. Then save the file and send it as an attachment in CyberClass. Homework and quizzes must be submitted by the due date. After that time, no homework or quizzes will be accepted. This policy is designed to help you keep up with the material. After the due date, your scores and the correct answers will be released. 
    * **Missed exams:** **_No make-up exams will be given._**
      * If you know in advance that you will miss an exam in the case of a special emergency, let me know so we can arrange for you to take it early. 
      * You may miss one exam because of sickness with prior notice and I will give you a grade based on the average of your other exam scores, but a documented excuse (doctor's note) will be required. 
      * Any further exams missed or unexcused absences from an exam will result in a grade of zero. 
    * **Missed quizzes:** **_No make-up quizzes will be given._**
      * If you know in advance that you will miss a quiz in the case of a special emergency, let me know so we can reschedule it. 
      * Any unexcused quizzes not submitted will result in a grade of zero. 
    * **Missed homework:** **_No make-up homework will be allowed._**
      * If you know in advance that you will miss a homework assignment in the case of a special emergency, let one of us know so we can resolve the problem. 
      * Any unexcused homework not submitted will result in a grade of zero. 
    * **Regrading:** If an error has been made in grading your exam or if you think an error may have been made, you may submit it for regrading within one week after it has been returned. Some of the exams will be photocopied at random when they are graded, to discourage taking unfair advantage of the regrading policy. 
    * **Snow days:** In the event of a closure of the campus due to inclement weather, the exam scheduled for the missed day will automatically switch to the next Saturday unless we can all agree to do it earlier. 
  * **Communication and Participation in Chats and emails:** During the course, you must participate in electronic office hours (chats) at least twice a week using Cyberclass. You should also participate in questions of the week (when posted) and try to engage in a threaded discussion. You are encouraged to stay in touch with us and with your classmates by email. 

* * *

**Miscellany:  ** |

    * Study Guides, Lecture Outlines, and Objectives will be provided for each unit, and Review Sessions will be scheduled before each exam. 
    * CU the Springs is committed to providing equal educational opportunity for all students who meet the academic admissions requirements. The purpose of [Disability Services](http://www.uccs.edu/~success/resources/index.html#disability) is to provide comprehensive support to meet the individual needs of students with disabilities.

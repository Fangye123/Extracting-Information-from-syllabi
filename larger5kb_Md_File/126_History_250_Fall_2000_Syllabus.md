**Course Description**

This course is an introductory survey of the history of Spanish and Portuguese
America from the late pre-Contact era through the Wars of Independence (c.
1450-1820). The lectures, readings, and discussion sections offer a broad
overview of the cultural, political, social, and economic dimensions of
colonial Ibero-America. Recurrent themes to be discussed include: cultural
contact and conflict, social organization and stratification, racial mixture
and race relations, gender and sexuality, labor systems, economic production,
colonial administration, identity politics, religion and spirituality, and
nationalism.

colonial Latin American history as well as major debates on how to understand
colonial Latin American history. The writing assignments concentrate on
improving historical writing and research skills.

**Statement of Academic Integrity**

Essential to the fundamental purpose of the University is the commitment to
principles of truth and academic honesty. Because academic dishonesty, which
refers to cheating, plagiarism, or helping someone else to cheat or commit
plagiarism, jeopardizes the quality of education and depreciates the genuine
achievement of others it must be reported to the Honor Council.

The Code of Academic Integrity guides this and all other courses taught at the
University of Maryland. Violations may result in a failing grade and/or
referral to a University disciplinary committee. The full text of the Code is
available through the [Office of Judicial
Programs](http://www.inform.umd.edu/CampusInfo/Departments/jpo/code_acinteg.html).

Should you have _ANY_ questions or doubts about Academic Integrity, including
questions of citation and attribution, please see your teaching assistant
and/or the professor.

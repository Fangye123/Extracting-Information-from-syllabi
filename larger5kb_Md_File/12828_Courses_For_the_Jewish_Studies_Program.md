    A.  Description and Objectives.
        Germany has played a decisive role in the development of modern
    Europe and the world.  Germans have formulated political and economic
    philosophies that have been adopted as organizing concepts throughout
    the world, and pioneered scientific, technical and educational
    innovations that have had a profound influence on the lives of people
    everywhere.  The struggle to create a unitary German state in the
    nineteenth century, Germany's initiation of two wars of conquest, and
    the recent reunification of Germany have had political repercussions
    that have fundamentally shaped diplomacy far beyond the European
    continent.  The objective of this course will be to examine the rise
    of Germany as a nation state, as a military power of world rank, as an
    economic dynamo, the disasters that it has inflicted on itself and its
    neighbors, and its new role in a reforming Europe.  This is a three
    credit hour course with no prerequisites.

**Modes of Instruction:**

On-line Discussion; Small group work; Case analysis; Lecture

**Requirements:**

**1.      Active Participation on NICENET. **Three to four times per week each
student must respond to the  
        posed discussion topic, provide feedback to peers comments, and pose new questions for exploration. This is similar to   
        an attendance requirement in a traditional classroom. 

**2.      Read the material** thoroughly. This will help you in making
insightful and clear comments regarding the topics of  
        the week on NICENET. 

**3.      Engage in several small group activities** via the Internet. Small
group assignments will be described on the  
        NICENET calendar. 

**4.      Take the Career Counseling Assessment Tools**: Myers Briggs Type
Inventory, Strong Interest Inventory, and the  
        16PF. The test booklets will be checked out to students for one week to complete the assessments. The response forms   
        are available in the bookstore. We will mail in the response forms for computer results. We have a limited number of the   
        MBTI questions booklets. One group of students will complete the MBTI after our first class and return the question   
        booklet, so that others can complete their response sheet. All three response sheets need to be in my office in Kalamazoo   
        by July 3rd. So basically you have one week to complete the three assessments and get them to my office. You can use   
        campus mail through the Traverse City Center or U.S. mail. If your assessments are not fully complete and to me by this   
        date, there is no guarantee that they will be returned by our next session on July 21st, at which time we will be reviewing   
        your results. 

**5.     Complete the midterm exam** covering history of career development,
theory and counseling.

**6.     Complete your own Career Flower** as described in _The New Quick Job-
Hunting Map_. I will provide an example  
        and discuss the process with you. 

**7.      Write a Career Autobiography** which combines information learned
from your Career Flower, your test results and  
        theoretical understanding of your development.   
        *Ten to fifteen pages, typed in APA Style. Be sure to consult the Publication Manual of the APA, 4th Ed (1994) for   
        style and reference questions. Running head not required.   
        *Graduate level writing and attention to detail is expected.   
        *Submit your paper stapled, with a cover page only - no fancy folders.   
        *Paper will be evaluated on content (80%) and clarity of presentation (20%).

**There are sample papers on reserve in the Education library which can be
used a guides.**

**7\. Presentation:**

Presentations may be given individually or in pairs. The presenters will
research, organize and present on a special topic in career development.
Select one of the special populations (ch.15-19) for presentation: women; men;
family; children; multicultural issues; or disabilities.

Turn in a written paragraph describing your focused presentation topic and
identify the members of your presentation team by July 6, 2000. All members of
the group must present. Provide the class with a one or two page summary of
the presentation with references.  
Time: Forty-five minutes, allowing five minutes for questions and/or comments.
A group grade will be given.

The presentations will be delivered in a conference format with two
presentations running at the same time. All observers are required to provide
written feedback to the presenters which will be viewed by the instructor and
incorporated into the evaluation. The presentations will be evaluated on their
research base, and clarity of presentation style as seen in the presentation,
handout and peer evaluation.

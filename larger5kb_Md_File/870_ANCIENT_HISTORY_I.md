**_NOTE:  _ Week 13:** Change in reading assignment (as announced in class on
Thursday 11/16):  Bailkey reading changed to #30 intro., B, C, D (omit part A
of #30).  Martin reading remains the same.  ***See extra credit revisions
below.***  
  
  ** _ _Makeup of ID section of mid-term exam__**.  

     The format of the makeup will be as follows: 15 terms/names will be listed, from which each student will select 10. For each, 3 facts will be requested (3 pt.s for each ID).  You should re-study the terms, names and places listed in the **Study Guide** (Map & ID lists) in terms of the following information: 1) _who or what_ is it (city, king, etc.); 2) _where_ is it from (which civilization); 3) which time period is it from ( _when_?) and 4) _why is it important_ (for some terms, like "funerary temple," you should be able to come up with an example/site in this category).   For time periods pertaining to Egypt, use chronological eras such as Old Kingdom, 1st Interm. Period, New Kingdom, etc.  For Sumer, use chronological eras such as Proto-Literate, Early Dynastic, etc.  For other civilizations/cultures, use archaeological periods like Neolithic, Early Bronze Age, Middle Bronze Age, Late Bronze Age, Early Iron Age. 

Example:  Hammurapi: 1) king  2) Babylonian Empire  3) Middle Bronze Age  4)
wrote Law Code of Hammurapi.

Example:  ziggurat: 1) temple construction  2) Sumer  3) Early Dynastic (also
in UrIII)  4) site: found at Ur, Uruk, etc.; or, for its importance: shows
intense Sumerian attention to religion.

.   **THE COURSE.  ** During this semester, we will study the development of
western civilization from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern farming
villages more than 10,000 years ago to the opulent Hellenistic civilization
fostered by the conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when
humankind emerged from cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to
build cities, and to devise the complex system of social relationships we call
civilization. We will see how the invention of writing allows us to observe
the systems of government, society, and laws of the ancients. We will note the
formation of states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that recurs with
infinite variations over and over throughout the brief period of humankind's
recorded history. There will also be a strong emphasis on the art and
archaeology of the ancient world--the physical and visual evidence which each
civilization has left behind--and what they tell us about that society's
tastes and beliefs. This course will try to demonstrate how similar we are in
many ways to our ancient relatives, and how our basic characteristics as a
species remain unchanged. Due to the span of time we examine, we will be
moving quickly from one period to another, and the effect may at times be
confusing.  Ask questions...let me know what is baffling or overwhelming.  The
ancient world is at once familiar and mysterious, and the gaps in our
knowledge of it allow for broad interpretation. I hope that this course will
get you to think and to analyze, to question "facts" and to develop your own
opinions, for these are the true benefits of studying history.  
---  
.   **THE BOOKS.  ** Our basic modern texts for this course are:  
**_     Knapp = _**A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western
Asia & Egypt. _4th ed.  
        Chicago, 1988.    
**_     Martin = _** __ Thomas Martin. _Ancient Greece.   _Yale Univ. Press.
1996.  
We will also examine original sources from:  
**_     Bailkey = _**N.M. Bailkey. _Readings in Ancient History._ Lexington,
Mass. 5th ed., 1996.  
---  
.   **INTERNET RESOURCES:** During this semester you should become familiar
with the course Web Page
(http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_00f.htm).   The syllabus,
supplementary readings, study aids, and study guides for the exams will be
posted on the web page.  In general, I will also use the web page to
communicate with you between classes and to post changes in the course
schedule and assignments.  It would be a good idea to check the course web
page regularly for updates.  
---  
.   **REQUIREMENTS:** There will be **two exams** , each of which will include
a map section and at least one essay.  In order to "help" you keep up with
your reading assignments, there will be **brief quizzes** at the beginning of
selected class periods (roughly once a week). The quizzes are designed to see
if you have read the assignments **and will be of a general nature**.   The
first exam will constitute 30% of your grade, the second one 50% and the
quizzes and class participation (attendance) the remaining 20%.  Some
important concepts and issues will be presented only in class, and for this
reason, class participation and attendance forms a significant portion of the
final grade.  
---  
.   **POLICY ON MAKEUP EXAMS:** Students who miss the midterm and final exams
will be allowed to make up the exam only if they provide the instructor with
acceptable documentation explaining their absence. I expect students who will
miss an exam to inform me prior to the time of the exam, unless extreme
circumstances prevent this (you may do this by e-mail or by leaving a voice-
mail message at the above number, specifically directed to me).   The makeup
exam must be taken during the week following the missed exam, except under
extreme circumstances. Makeup exams are more demanding than regular exams.
**It is not permitted to use notes or tapes for purposes of sale.**

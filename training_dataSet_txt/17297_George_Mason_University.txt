George Mason University
George Mason University School of
Law
Products Liability  
Winter 2000
Professor Krauss
 
Syllabus
Overview
            Products
Liability is, with the possible exception of Constitutional Law, the most controversial
area of American law.  Products
Liability has acquired a life of its own in America – thus this course
instead of one rushed week in an already crowded Torts curriculum.  The exploration of Products Liability
problems is a stimulating (and at times frustrating...) one.  This is a topical course, but it is a
difficult one, too.  Why is it
difficult?  Because we’re
going to get to the bottom of the “crisis” that allegedly plagues
Products Liability.  
 
Compulsory Texts, Organization of
Classes, etc.
            An
estimated time allocation for class sessions follows.  Page numbers refer to the casebook (Owen, Montgomery &
Keeton, Products Liability & Safety, 3d ed., 1996, as modified by the 2000 supplement).[1]
Problems are from Lebel et al., Products Liability Problems.  The monograph is Krauss, Fire and Smoke:  Government Tort Suits and the Rule of
Law (1999).  All these should be purchased.

Evaluation
            Assuming
that twenty-five or fewer students are enrolled in the course, there will be no final exam.  The final grade will be accounted for
in one of two ways:  you may EITHER
prepare a paper (minimum 20 pages, maximum 30 pages) on one products liability
issue, and submit it to me at the last class, OR you may submit 5 mini-papers
in answer to five of the problems assigned in the readings.  The mini-papers (minimum 4 typed
double-spaced pages, maximum 8 pages each) will be graded the way diving
competitions are evaluated -- so do not cavalierly choose easy questions, as
these will be much more rigorously graded. If you choose one of the longer papers, you must
sign up by February 1.  I encourage
you to consider this latter option.
            In
preparing your paper or mini-papers, be as thorough, as creative and (most
important of all) as theoretical as interest and available time allow!  Each mini-paper must be handed in
before the beginning of the class during which the chapter containing the
relevant problem will be discussed. Refer to the schedule above to get an idea
of the dates.    [If you
are going to miss a particular class, your mini-paper must be faxed to me
before the beginning of class.]
            Class
attendance is a must.  You must
attend 80% of classes to avoid “capital punishment” (or at least,
its grading equivalent...).  And
you must be prepared for class (i.e., compulsory readings must be done beforehand).  You each may use one
“pass”, at your discretion, by coming to see me before class begins and asking not to be
called on. If I call on you and you are not prepared for class, and have not
taken a pass that day, you have in my view committed a serious breach of
trust.  This will result in a minus
one-notch penalty.  On the other
hand, if your comments are frequently very helpful to the discussion, you will
receive a one-notch bonus on your final grade.
 
 





[1] NB: You are responsible for always adding the
relevant pages from the 2000 supplement to the Owen casebook:  Sometimes the supplement REPLACES pages
in the casebook!

FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTION  
ABOUT A BIOLOGY MAJOR

_I think I want to be a biologist. How can I get general information as to
what biologists do?_  
Visit the Dept of Biological Sciences office which is located in room 292
Lapham Hall. The department has some general handouts that might be of
service. You can also stop in the Career Development Center (CDC) Office in
Mellencamp 128 and ask for information or visit the CDC internet site
(<http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/CDC/>). A general source on the internet about
science careers is provided by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). NAS
which is linked to the Biological Science career page
(<http://www2.nas.edu/cpc/index.html>) will provide you with several options
for information, including the booklet "A Students Guide to Careers in Science
and Engineering". In addition, you can pick up a handout entitled "Surfing the
Net for Careers in Biology" in the Dept of Biological Sciences which should
help you search for current information on Biology.

_I am thinking about choosing biology as my major. How can I get more
information on the major?_  
Visit the Dept of Biological Sciences office which is located in room 292
Lapham Hall. Ask the secretaries for the handouts defining the requirements
for the major. Also ask to see a faculty [Advisor](advisors.html). You can
choose a general advisor or an advisor for a more specific area of biology.
Call and make an appointment or stop by at their office hours. The secretaries
in the office can provide you with their office hours for a specific semester.

_When should I formally declare my major in Biology?_  
You should complete BioSci 150,152 and 260 or their equivalents before
declaring a major in Biological Sciences. The major should be declared after
45 credits. Feel free to contact a Biological Sciences
[Advisor](advisors.html) prior to declaring your major. You should also see a
Letters & Science (L & S) advisor in Holton Hall regarding your general
education and college requirements.

_How can I formally declare my major in Biology?_  
You must complete a "Declaration of Major Form" for the College of Letters  &
Science and the Dept of Biological Sciences. You can obtain this form from the
Biological Sciences office (Lapham Hall Rm 292) or the Letters & Science
Advising Office (Holton Hall 141). You will need to choose an
[Advisor](advisors.html) in biology, evaluate your courses with your advisor,
get their signature on the form and return the form to the secretaries in the
Biological Sciences department office. After the Department Chair signs the
form, it will be sent to the Letters & Science Student Services. They will
evaluate your current transcript and send you a "Summary of Major
Requirement". Examine this summary carefully, discuss the evaluations and
future course requirements with your advisor in biology and use this form to
track your requirements for the major.

_I need a unofficial copy of my transcript to evaluate my current status.
Where do I get one?_  
You can get an unofficial copy of your transcripts in Enrollment Services
which is located in Mellencamp Hall, room 274.

_I am a pre-professional major (Pre-medicine, pre-dentistry, etc.) and have
been regularly seeing the specific Letters & Science advisor in Holton Hall.
Do I also need to see an Biology advisor and declare a major in Biology?_  
Yes. Majors are declared in an academic department and you need to see an
[Advisor](advisors.html) to declare a major. The pre-professional advisor in
Letters & Science can provide more specific requirements and admission
information on applying to the various professional schools. You should see
both advisors.

_I am a transfer students from another campus and need my biology courses
evaluated for biology credit. How do I get them evaluated?_  
Visit the Dept of Biological Sciences office which is located in room 292
Lapham Hall. Ask the secretaries for the name of the faculty who will do the
course evaluation. You should come with a transcript, description of the
course from the university catalog, and all available material on the course
(course syllabus for lecture and/or lab, textbook used, number of lecture,
discussion and/or laboratory hours).

_I would like to do laboratory/library research with one of the Biology
faculty under the independent study course (204-699). How do I arrange this
special course?_  
First, determine if you meet the course prerequisites (GPA of 2.5 or better,
jr. status). Second, you need to talk to the faculty with whom you like to do
research. Normally you would have had this faculty in some course which would
provide the foundation for the type of research you wish to pursue. Visit
their [home page](../Faculty/facultyindex.html) to determine their scientific
discipline and the type of research they do. It is recommended that you make
an appointment with the faculty or visit him/her during their office hours.
Faculty normally instruct a limited number of students per semester because of
the one-on-one instruction involved. It is recommended that you contact them
the semester before you plan on taking the course. Present your request,
future goals and interests. If the faculty accepts you for the independent
study, you will need to complete an independent study form. You can pick up
the form from the Department secretaries in Rm 292 Lapham Hall. You will need
to complete the form (4-5 copies) including the study proposal and course
requirements for grading. The study proposal is usually developed in
consultation with the faculty and requires their signature. Third, drop off
the independent study form with the secretaries in Rm 292 and they will obtain
the signature of the department chair and then forward the forms to the
Letters & Science Dean for Student Academic Services. At the end of the
course, a copy of any paper must be submitted to the department office (room
292).

_I plan on graduating this year. What do I need to do?_  
Schedule a visit with both your Letters  & Science advisor and your
[Advisor](advisors.html) in biology to insure that you have met all
requirements for graduation. The semester you plan to graduate you will also
need to complete the "Graduation Request" form. This form will be sent to you
automatically if you check the appropriate box during registration. The
university will re-evaluate whether you have met all requirements for
graduation and will notify you if you have any deficiencies.

CATALOG DESCRIPTION OF COURSE:**  
  
Welcome to Human Resource Development, PSYC 4053    Catalog Definition (2002):
An overview of the psychological aspects of human resource development in
terms of training, development and education where learning and transfer of
learning is key to the developmental processes of the individual and the
organization.    This course is designed to give the student an survey of the
Human Resource Development (HRD) occupational specialty \-- an applied
INDUSTRIAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL psychology area.  IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO
TRAIN THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE AMERICA WORK.   In the U.S., business and industry
has spent more than $2 trillion over the past ten years attempting to train
its workers with varying degrees of success.  This figure rivals that of
higher education in the U.S. Training systems are being strengthened so that
the human resources in the organizations will be prepared adequately for the
future.  Training is  the issue:  job skills, safety, process control, sales
and marketing, communications, participation, human relations -- the list goes
on and on.  
  
HRD is a dynamic and applied field that draws on many theories and insights
from many disciplines including education, communications, organizational
behavior, management science, industrial and individual psychology, economics,
and sociology.   HRD's primary focus is in three areas that use development
and guidance as their central process:  Training, Organizational and Career.
The result is the output of improved behavior in the organization which is
beneficial to the individual (individually and professionally) and to the
organization.  Human Resource Development in an organization is considered to
be those organized learning activities that are arranged in the organization
to improve performance and personal growth for the purpose of improving
individual behavior, the job, and/or the organization.  It refers to the
learning activities of people for their current jobs , their future work
assignments and individual growth.  
  
**COURSE PURPOSE:**  
  
This course has been designated as an approved liberal arts course.     It is
designed to provide the student with a comprehensive and experiential exposure
to Human Resource Development.  
**  
EXPECTED COURSE OUTCOMES:**  
  
Upon completion of this course, the student will be able to:  
  
    1.    define human resource development and identify the basic processes,  professionalism, and competencies required in the field; explain and describe career opportunities in HRD.

**Part 3 The Project - Your personal training program**  
  
    The Final Experience!  
            The four weeks of the semester will be   
                actually practicing training.   See 30-minute   
                training project  
  
  
  
  
**STUDENT PERFORMANCE ACTIVITIES:**  
  
Since this course utilizes the workshop/seminar format, satisfactory
completion depends upon your regular attendance and participation.    If for
some reason, you cannot attend and participate regularly, then perhaps you
need to drop the course and take one where that is not a requirement.
Participation does not mean monopolizing, but contributing to the work.  
  
**ASSIGNMENT DUE DATES:    See Calendar for dates.  
**  
Each class period, at least one student will be responsible for facilitating
an "Opener" -- (ice breaker) and demonstrating text concepts.  For your
opening act, be prepared to have a one-page write-up about your activity to
hand out to the class after  the activity is completed.  Keep these in a
notebook and you'll have a nice file when the semester is over.  
  
The training project will consist of a major project (a mini paper for each
chapter) and  a 30-minute training activity.  Each student will have an
opportunity to engage in active training either as an individual or in a
group.  Presentation skills will be practiced all semester long.  
The  progressive paper that will be done in 3 installments (14 chapters- Ch 10
excluded is an example of a finished product)  throughout the semester.  You
can work ahead and get them all done or you can do them as assigned.    It is
"a work at your own pace" type thing for the progressive paper.  You will need
to read ahead and work on your own as far as the paper is concerned.  We will
cover most of the text in class, but not all.   We will be taking it in the
order it is presented in the text.  
  
**  
STUDENT EVALUATION:**  
  
The final numerical grade will be converted to a letter grade using the
following relationships:  
  

  90 - 100 = A  
80 -   89 B  
 70 - 79 = C  
60 - 69 = D  
Below 60= F  

  
**THE GRADING:**  
  
    Grades in this class are based on average percentages in 3 categories.  Each of the grade categories is weighted separately.  The entries in each category are averaged.  A percentage grade is determined by combining the category averages using the appropriate weights.  Students will receive computer status sheets which will provide the necessary feedback concerning performance in the class.  The categories used are:  
  
    Participation and Attendance - 20% of your overall grade  
    Project (written and Presentation) - 40% of your overall grade  
    Assignments - 40% of your overall grade  
  
**DID YOU KNOW???**  
  
Time spent in business:     Writing   =   9%  
                Reading   =  16%  
                Speaking  =  30%  
                Listening =  45%  
  
Schools teach:          Reading   =  52%  
                 Writing   =  30%  
                Speaking  =  10%  
                Listening =   8%

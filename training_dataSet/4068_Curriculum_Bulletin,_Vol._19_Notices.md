Important Information**

Interium Course Syllabus Policy - 3-D

Senate in 1993 regarding course syllabi which should be considered an interim
policy of the University of Arizona pending formal adoption as institutional
policy. Please call this policy to the attention of all course instructors,
including adjunct faculty.

The distribution of a course information sheet is required for all University
courses. It must be distributed during the first week of classes and a copy,
available to students, must be kept in the departmental office for a period of
not less than one year. The following minimum information shall be provided:

1) Instructor's name, office (room) number, and telephone number;  
2) Office hours or a statement of an "open-door" policy;  
3) Grade and absence policies;  
4) List of required texts;  
5) Number of required examinations and papers;  
6) Required extracurricular activities, if any, and;  
7) Special materials required for the class, if any.

A statement is permissible indicating that information contained in the course
information sheet, other than indicating that information contained in the
course information sheet, other than the grade and absence policies, may be
subject to change with advance notice, as deemed appropriate by the
instructor.

By copy of this memorandum to the Undergraduate Council, I am asking that
consideration be given to adding an eighth required element to the course
information sheet that would provide notification of course content that may
be deemed objectionable by some students. Of course, as the Council
deliberates this proposed requirement, instructors may elect to augment their
course information sheets with such information.

**1999-2000 UA General Catalog - 3-D**

The University of Arizona  
Office of the Registrar

Memorandum

To: Deans, Directors, and Department Heads  
From: W. Gary Wagner, Director - Curriculum and Registration  
Date: 03/17/99  
Re: 1999-2000 UA General Catalog

The 1999-2000 UA General Catalog, produced by the Office of Curriculum
Initiatives and Academic Information, will be available online by March 31st,
1999.

The University will no longer be producing the General Academic Manual, the
transition version of the printed catalog. We are now providing only the
online version, Desert Lynx, which is the official document of record for the
University of Arizona. Please remove all references to a printed General
Catalog from your 1999-2000 publications and replace them with references to
the Online General Catalog. URL: <http://catalog.arizona.edu/>.

For individuals and institutions that request a printed catalog, we will offer
as an alternative the University of Arizona Guide. The Guide is a high
quality, 115-page, photo-rich publication, which is an excellent resource for
prospective undergraduate students, high school counselors, and community
college advisors. It provides information on UA colleges, departments, majors,
degrees, admission requirements and high school preparation, transfer student
policies, financial aid and scholarships, housing, and career opportunities.
Requests for a catalog or for a Guide are handled differently, depending on
the type of request.

All institutional requests for a catalog or Guide may be forwarded to Norma
Provencio, Office of The Registrar, Administration 305, The University of
Arizona, PO Box 210066, Tucson, AZ 85721-0066; 621-4755; e-mail:
[nprovenc@u.arizona.edu](mailto:nprovenc@u.arizona.edu). Academic units on
campus can obtain copies of the Guide for recruiting purposes by contacting
Norma.

Any written or e-mail requests for a catalog, coming from an individual, may
be forwarded to Norma. Telephone requests for catalogs and all requests for
the Guide from individuals should be directed to the UofA Bookstore, PO Box
210019, Tucson, AZ 85721-0019; 1-800-YES-UofA or local 621-5127; e-mail:
[catalogs@www.bookstore.arizona.edu](mailto:catalogs@www.bookstore.arizona.edu).
The Guide costs $5.00 each plus $5.00 for shipping and handling.

Thank you for your help during this time of transition.

**Goals:** This course seeks to examine the foundations of education by
focusing on the interrelationships between education and democracy. Particular
attention will be paid to issues involving cultural literacy, language - words
- and power, morality and education, and the role and function of the
individual as related to self and to society.

**Responsibilities:**

  1. Attendance - because of the seminar format of the course, no more than one absence is allowed. 
  2. Weekly essays - The sharing of weekly essays, written in response to the assigned readings, will promote enhancement of your written and oral skills, independent thinking, and group discussion. These essays must be submitted electronically to the entire class no later than noon on the day preceding our actual class meeting. 
  3. Final Paper - Your response (6-8 pages) to Hirsch's **The Schools We Need & Why We Don't Have Them**. Presented in a coherent fashion and in your own individual voice, the paper should be develped from the essays and class discussions throughout the semester. Note: I do not expect this to be a major research project. However, I do expect it to show good "scholarly" reference to selected primary readings of the course as well as to some secondary sources. 

Papers will be graded on intent, content, reasoning, language, neatness,
effort, accuracy.

**Grades:** based on class participation, short papers, and final paper

**Weekly Essays**

This course requires each of you to submit a 2-3 page essay for each week's
assignment and to read everyone else's essays for the week prior to coming to
class. The three-fold purpose of this sharing is to  
  

  * promote a professional environment of constructive criticism 
  * encourage responsible, serious and professional commentary 
  * make it possible for students to follow up one another's comments and engage in further discussion privately or collectively 

The selection process below allows you to submit your own essays and to read
those submitted by classmates. Simply click the appropriate choice.

Note: this process functions only for students who are registered for this
course and have been assigned a course password.

Usually, my evaluative comments about these essays will be addressed on an
individual basis, thus safeguarding privacy and student sensitivity while also
allowing the individual to forward those comments to classmates as (s)he sees
fit. However, when I believe that my comments to an individual will be helpful
to all students, I will post them under [Prof.'s
Comments](ProfComments603.html), which you should check periodically.

Jimmy will introduce you.  
  
---|---  
  
  
  
In this second module, you join Marlo and Jimmy in their efforts to ferret out
the intentions of the Convoluted Fabrication School District (CFSD). In this
episode, you will move about the world of educational services and legal
mandates that protect children with special needs. You will get an opportunity
to peek inside the world of parents - partners in your search for doing what
is best for students, and get an idea of how they view student needs and the
services available to them. You may be surprised when you realize how
desperate many parents are to help and protect these youth they love so much.  
  
In your previous work on module one, you came to appreciate and value the
individuality of each youngster. Now, you no longer look through a youngster
in a wheel chair or turn your head and ignore those around you who are
visually impaired. You have learned a new appreciation for their desire to be
loved and accepted as people. You have come closer to "walking a mile in their
shoes," and you see how important it is to honor every person.  
  
The study of the fight to secure protection for those who are not able to
fight for themselves is a poignant history. It is not without valor on both
sides. Like most ethical issues, the legal battle has been a series of defeats
and victories - skirmishes and battles, if you will, in the long human story
of equality. Of course, as you learned in your study of history, both sides
are often willing to fight long and hard to ensure their world view is upheld.  
  
The United States Educational system has a peculiar and proud history. While
other countries were busy developing tests to determine who belonged in
school, we were laying the foundation that allowed all children to receive an
education. Of course, when we said all children, we really did not envision
today's schools. But here we are. The school is the fulcrum of the US
Constitutional image of equality -- Equal rights for all, or equality for
those who can stand up and fight for their rights?  
  
**Equal rights** \- especially for the down trodden, the less gifted, the
bilingual, the youngster with Down Syndrome, the student with Cerebral Palsy
-- no wonder you are so excited about learning more. **You** can make a
difference. You, in your life work can be a Dorothea Dix or a Clara Barton.
You can be for your students who Sam Kirk was for people with learning
disabilities.  
  
But enough rhetoric. What do you know about the history of educating children
with disabilities? How many major court cases has it taken to get to this
point? And where do we need to go now? Join Marlo and Jimmy, learning about
the critical issues so you are fully prepared to join those of us who believe
that Lady Liberty needs our help.  
  
The following course objectives will guide your work.  
  

Course Objectives for this Module

2\. Demonstrate knowledge of IDEA 1997, AZ Statutes and Section 504, Rehab.
Act  
---  
3\. Analyze legal responsibilities of schools, parents, students.  
7\. Demonstrate an understanding of the roles of parents with children who
have disabilities.  
13\. Knowledge of current issues and trends in special education and
consultation/ collaboration  
  
  
  
The search for critical court cases can begin at any time. You will find it
fascinating as you realize how much case law and legal information is just a
mouse click away. The United State Legislature offers numerous sites that
provide full disclosure of activities, legal business being conducted and how
each member votes. There is access to the briefs and decisions of many lower
courts and even sites to learn more about what the Supreme Court is reviewing,
as well as the briefs they prepare to explain decisions. You may want to begin
finding these sites by clicking here
<http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jde7/ese504/class/advanced/publiclaw.html>  
  
You will also find it helpful to access the Boss Man's personal set of briefs.
He was quite interested in the rights of children for a while and summarized a
set of cases that you can gain access to:
[http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jde7/ese504/class/advanced/courtcases.html
](http://jan.ucc.nau.edu/~jde7/ese504/class/advanced/courtcases.html) He also
kept a large number of bound notes. These certainly should be checked out in
detail!

**This is an important work, you are beginning. Of course, you will earn
credits and you will learn many things as you complete the objectives, but
most importantly, as you come to understand the critical nature and
significance of helping each child become all he or she can be, you will be
answering that daunting question asked by John Donne.  
  
You will know for whom the bell tolls . . . and you will be ready to
respond,** |

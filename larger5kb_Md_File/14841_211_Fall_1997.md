Course Description and Objectives  
The beginning of a four-semester sequence in Western Civilization, this course
is an introduction to the history of the Mediterranean world and Europe from
ancient times to the end of the Middle Ages, with particular attention given
to classical Greece and Rome and the High Middle Ages. The purpose of the
Western Civilization sequence is to provide students of history and the
liberal arts with a solid foundation in the principal ideas, institutions, and
events that have shaped Western civilization. It seeks to promote an
understanding of historical context and perspective and to encourage the
skills essential to historical inquiry, including the capacity to define
historical questions, analyze primary documents, evaluate alternative
interpretations, develop coherent arguments, and write clearly and
effectively. The course is organized in chronological sequence, with emphasis
given to the close relationship between economic, social, political,
religious, and intellectual developments of the same immediate historical
period.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  

Exams will consist of short-answer questions and large essay questions. Each
of the three exams will cover roughly one-third of the course; the third exam
will also include a comprehensive section.

2\. A paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 20% for the
second)  

The research paper can be on any topic in Western civilization through the
Middle Ages. Papers are to be analytical and interpretive; they should present
a thesis and develop an argument. You are encouraged to use primary sources,
and you are expected to examine the historiographical context of your topic.
The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of the thesis and
argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the quality of the
writing. The grade of the second draft will also reflect the improvement (or
lack of improvement) shown between the first and second draft. You should
consult with me about your paper at least a week before each draft is due.

3\. Class participation and daily writing assignments (15%)  

The success of this class depends upon the quality of the dialogue in class.
It is expected that you will attend every class and that you will be fully
prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day. Class participation
grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency of your
contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

Each of you will submit a short writing assigment by 10 am on class days. You
are to write one or two paragraphs (but not more than one page) summarizing
the most significant or revealing points in the day's readings. You are also
to articulate at least two questions of the material. The assignments are to
be type-written and may be submitted through email or placed in my mailbox.

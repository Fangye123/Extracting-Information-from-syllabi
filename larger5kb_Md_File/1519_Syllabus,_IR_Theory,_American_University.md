This course examines concepts and debates from a variety of theoretical
traditions in international relations. The substantive emphasis of the course
is primarily, but not exclusively, war and peace. While the traditions
reviewed in the course have guided the study of important topics other than
war and peace (international organization, international political economy,
etc.), narrowing the substantive coverage of the course helps to provide a
common ground for comparing and evaluating the theories. Much of the overview
offered here pertains to IR as a subfield of political science -- commensurate
with your instructor's training -- but virtually all of the theoretical
frameworks we consider have been influenced by one or more of the other social
sciences (primarliy economics and sociology), and some by the humanities as
well (philosophy, historiography, and literature).  
  
  
**Reading Materials**  
  
Six required coursebooks have been ordered by the Campus Store, and are also
on reserve at the library:

  * Michael W. Doyle, _Ways of War and Peace_. New York: W.W. Norton, 1997. 
  * Michael Walzer, _Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral Argument with Historical Illustrations_ , second edition. New York: Basic Books, 1992. 
  * Charles R. Beitz, _Political Theory and International Relations_ , second edition. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1999. 
  * Martin Hollis and Steve Smith, _Explaining and Understanding International Relations_. Oxford: Clarendon, 1990. 
  * J. Ann Tickner, _Gender in International Relations: Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Security_. New York: Columbia University Press, 1992. 
  * Jim George, _Discourses of Global Politics: A Critical (Re)Introduction to International Relations_. Boulder: Lynne Rienner, 1994. 
Students desiring a basic overview of IR theory might wish to consult Paul R.
Viotti and Mark V. Kauppi, _International Relations Theory: Realism,
Pluralism, Globalism, and Beyond_ , third edition (Allyn and Bacon, 1999).
James E. Dougherty and Robert L. Pfaltzgraff, Jr. provide a more comprehensive
survey in their _Contending Theories of International Relations_ , fourth
edition (Longman, 1997). Fairly sophisticated introductory discussions of the
main theoretical traditions, including recent challenges to the mainstream,
can be found in Scott Burchill, Andrew Linklater, et al., _Theories of
International Relations_ (St. Martin's, 1996). For a historical overview of
the field, see Torbj orn L. Knutsen, _A History of International Relations
Theory_ (Manchester University Press, 1992), especially part III.  
  
  
**Requirements and Evaluation**  
  
Class sessions will be conducted largely in seminar format, so class
discussion is central to the success of the course. In addition to
participation in discussion (25% of your final course grade), students are
also required to submit a 5-6 page critical review of one of the assigned
books (25%), due within two weeks of our completion of the book. Lastly, there
will be a cumulative [take-home final exam](is601fin.html) (50%), to be
distributed on 1 May (our final meeting) and due on 9 May.

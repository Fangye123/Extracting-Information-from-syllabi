(II)](http://www.virginia.edu/oldbooks/rbs98/summer_expanded.shtml#46)  
3-7 August 1998**

1) _How useful were the pre-course readings?_

**1:** My course had none. **3:** Generally. **5:** I read some of the pre-
course readings, but the course instruction did not really require preparatory
reading. **6:** Very helpful - gave exposure to the vocabulary, concepts, and
etext Web page. **7:** OK. **8:** Some-what useful, but we probably should
have been asked to become familiar with most of this stuff, rather than to
read it (with some obvious exceptions). **9:** Reading was a bit premature for
me. I did not have any experience (direct) with electronic texts. **10:** Very
helpful. Having some familiarity with all the course content allowed me to
never fall behind throughout the week. **11:** OK.

2) _Were the course syllabus and other materials distributed in class useful
(or will they be so in the future, after you return home)?_

**1-2:** Yes. **3:** Greatly. **4:** Yes. **5:** Very useful. **6-8:** Yes.
**9:** Yes, very relevant. However, since most were printouts from the Etext
Center's [Web] pages, the paper could have been saved. **10:** Yes - materials
will be useful reference sources when I return. **11:** Yes.

3) _Was the intellectual level of the course content appropriate?_

**1-2:** Yes. **3:** Exactly. **4-7:** Yes. **8:** Absolutely. **9:** Yes. I
considered it a survey course. **10:** Very. Our instructor adapted the
course, seemingly, to suit everyone's needs. **11:** Yes.

4) _If your course had field trips, were they effective?_

**1:** Yes. **3:** Absolutely. **4-8:** Yes. **9:** Two field trips were
relevant and useful. **11:** Yes.

5) _Did the actual course content correspond to its RBS brochure description
and Expanded Course Description (ECD)? Did the course in general meet your
expectations?_

**1:** Yes. **3:** Absolutely. **4-8:** Yes. **9:** I believe so. **10-11:**
Yes.

6) _What did you like best about the course?_

**1:** Its strength was its instructor, who is very knowledgeable. **3:** The
professionalism, complete knowledge, and teaching competence of the
instructor. **4:** Hands-on opportunity. **5:** Time slots were well
organized. (One break both in the morning and in the afternoon helped me be
awake.) The instruction was very clear and well prepared. **6:** Very
interesting presentations. Well-organized curriculum. Good opportunity for
hands-on and active participation. Expertise of instructor. Pleasantness of
instructor. Knowledgeable and articulate and helpful classmates. **7:** Hard
to say - the content is exciting, but DS made it live. So, I guess I'd say the
instructor. **8:** Studying with someone who a) knows his stuff, b) loves the
stuff, c) is able both to teach the stuff and communicate the enthusiasm.
**9:** I was given enough information and experience (hands-on) to create TEI
documents so I am able to make a decision about the management of grant money
received to create electronic texts. In my position, I will not be creating
these texts, but I am better able to evaluate the project's needs. **10:** We
covered a lot of information, had the satisfaction of digitizing an actual
letter. DS was really great and made a difficult subject understandable and
challenging. **11:** Broad view of project management issues.

7) _How could the course have been improved?_

**3:** Beyond implementing a second, intermediate level, version, I can think
of nothing. **4:** More tagging - another letter each - or an EAD document.
Maybe work in teams of two to negotiate levels of intensity of tagging. **5:**
Keep the number of participants as small as possible. **7:** Someone could
have sat on one of the students who kept trying to digress. **8:** Might have
limited in-class discussion relating to one participant's particular
situation. **9:** More hands-on experience \- scanning - another
transcription. **10:** I'm not sure that it could be.

8) _Please comment on the quality/enjoyability of the various RBS activities
in which you took part outside of class, eg Sunday afternoon tour, Sunday
night dinner and videos, evening lectures, Bookseller Night, tour of the
Alderman digital/electronic centers, &c.;_

**1:** Sunday night's dinner was high priced for what we were fed. I won't do
that again! **3:** Well thought out, instructive, pleasurable. **4:** Enjoyed
the dinner, videos, lectures, Bookseller Night - these were the ones that I
participated in. **5:** I found that the evening lectures had an approximately
appropriate length. If they had been longer than one hour, I could not have
been able to get to class on time the following morning. **6:** Very nice to
have the additional events - including coffee breaks - to get to mingle with
students and faculty in other courses. **7:** All were high quality. **8:**
LOVED the pen ruling video. Excellent lecture Wednesday [Paul Needham]. Very
sweet talk on Thursday [TB]. **9:** The Special Collections exhibit was great!
Lectures were helpful, but I prefer tours and hands-on activities. **10:** The
tour was fun - the only one I took while I was here, so I'm glad that it was
offered. Dinner was a nice ice breaker. Bookseller Night was a nice
opportunity to see a bit of Charlottesville.

9) _Any final thoughts? Did you get your money's worth?_

**1:** I will recommend the course (though not the Sunday night high-priced
dinner!). **3:** Excellent; highly recommended! **4-5:** Yes, I got my money's
worth. **6:** I got my money's worth. **7:** You need to offer a sequel. Make
this two weeks - one more elementary and add a more advanced section. **8:**
DS is an excellent instructor - I can hardly imagine the course being better
taught. But it's also true that I learned a tremendous amount from my fellow
students (besides having a lovely time with them). MORE than my money's worth.
**9:** I definitely got my money's worth. It's a luxury to study and learn and
I feel the course was worth my time and my institution's money. There is a lot
I am able to take back to the curator (who should also take this course).
**10:** This was a wonderful course and a terrific opportunity for me. **11:**
Yes, I got my money's worth.

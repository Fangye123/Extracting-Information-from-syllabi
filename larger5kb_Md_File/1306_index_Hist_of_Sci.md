_Description of Course:_

This course approaches the history of science from a philosophical
perspective, treating science in its cultural context. In other words, rather
than looking at science in teleological terms, we are interested in showing
how sciences develop within particular contexts in response to complex
cultural matrices. Science in a given culture is a product of the assumptions
of that culture; it responds to and in turn changes worldviews. Our approach
will incorporate a traditional descriptive approach to the history of science
with anthropological, historical, and philosophical methodologies,
perspectives, and materials. Through the semester we will examine the
development of science from the perspective of five cultures or historic
periods: Asia (focusing on China), western Middle Ages, medieval Islam,
"modern" West, contemporary world.



The course is composed of six units and introductory and summary sections. The
six units are cosmology, chemistry, math, optics, health care, and biology.



_Goals and Objectives of Course_

At the end of the course the students who have completed the assignments and
attended class sessions should have (1) command of a broad chronological
outline of the major trends, events, and personalities in the history of
science for the periods covered and (2) an understanding of the principle
issues and assumptions that are at the heart of the historical /cultural
treatment of the topic. Also, the students should have improved their ability
to write a precise analytical essay and research project, which build
arguments based on historical evidence using the rhetorical conventions of the
discipline. Further, students should have improved their ability to
participate in group discussions in which they are called upon to exercise
reasoning/analytical as well as human interaction skills.



_Requirements_



1\. Class participation: It is important that students attend every class
session and come prepared, having done their reading. This is particularly
important as many of the class sessions will be devoted to discussion and
depend on students having read and thought about the material. If you must
miss class please contact one of the professors before the class period. You
will need access to a Web CT account in order to keep informed about the daily
assignments, details of field trips, etc. This portion of the grade will be
determined by attendance in class and on fieldtrips, preparedness, and
participation in discussions. You may earn credit for the class participation
portion of the course by attending more than the three required field-trips.
Mid-way through the semester the professors will inform you of your
participation grade to that point.



2\. Reading questions: By noon of each Monday and Wednesday, please send via
the Web CT bulletin board one question or well-thought out observation about
the day's reading which you would like to discuss in class that day. Although
we may not get to all of the questions every day, we will frequently use your
questions and observations as the basis for class discussion



3\. Learning object: A computer learning object will accompany each unit. We
will utilize the objects as a type of hands-on lab activity to present issues
that are easier to comprehend in a graphical environment. Instructions will
follow. Check out learning objects in the Web-ct application.



3\. Formal response papers: You will need to write a five-page response paper
for each of the six units. The paper does not require outside research, but
you should establish a thesis (in consultation with the professors) and
support that thesis with your own analysis and materials you have encountered
in class readings or discussions. You will need to prepare a draft of the
paper, submit it to all the professors for comments, then prepare a revised
and final version of the paper which will be graded by one of the professors.
Each of the three professors will be the principle grader for two of the
units. The first draft of the paper is due one week after the end of the unit
to which it applies. The final draft is due a week later. You may use any
notation system you wish to cite materials, as long as you are consistent.
Papers will not be accepted late.



4\. Field trips: A field trip has been arranged in conjunction with each unit.
You need to attend at least three of those field trips, but are encouraged to
attend as many as you like. You will receive credit on your participation
grade for attending more than the required three field trips. The reading
component of this course is lighter than is typical for a four-credit upper
division social science course to allow you time for the field trips. They are
considered as much a part of the course requirements as reading and essays.
They are not optional or extra. A Hewlett Foundation Grant will cover all
entry fees and transportation costs for the field trips.



5\. Final product: Each student is required to produce a final project, which
will be delivered in a public venue (off campus) chosen in consultation with
the professor with whom you decide to work on this assignment. The project
will be a public presentation of some aspect of the subject that interests
you, and you should develop the project in consultation with the appropriate
professor. It will require outside research, but the parameters of the project
are very open. This is your chance to be creative. The venue in which you
decide to present your findings will depend on the subject of your research.
For example, if you decide to do research on western notions of old age; you
might want to present your paper in a retirement home or to a nursing class at
Lindfield College. If you decide to do your project on some aspect of Asian
concepts of wellness, you might arrange to present your findings to an Asian
audience. You could present your material to a high school class, or at OMSI.
There are many options, and you will receive as much help and advice from the
professors as you need.

Mediation Service:  
Students must spend approximately four hours each week of classes at the
Brooklyn Mediation Center (BMC), Manhattan Mediation Center (MMC), or Small
Claims Court (SCC). Keep a case record (on the form provided) reporting on
each clinical experience. You are expected to serve a minimum of 13 times
during the fall semester and 14 times in the spring semester. Your service
should begin this week. You will meet your trainer at your assigned center and
observe a mediation. In the event there are no cases, your trainer will lead
you in a skill-building role play or exercise. After each mediation session
give a brief report on your experience via the Clinic e-mail discussion group.
Your email should include the _key lessons_ you learned from your clinical
experience.

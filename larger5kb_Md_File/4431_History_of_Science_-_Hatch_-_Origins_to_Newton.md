HISTORY OF SCIENCE:  ORIGINS TO NEWTON

* * *

Dr Robert A. Hatch - 226 Keene-Flint Hall - 392-0271  
HIS 3463 (2507X) - Autumn 2001  
T7 (1.55-2.45) & R7-8 (1.55-3.50) - 2354 Turlington Hall  

* * *

In this course we survey changes and developments in Western science (natural
philosophy) from earliest times through the Scientific Revolution of the 17th
century. Lectures, discussions, and readings are concerned with the origin(s),
transmission, and development of scientific and philosophical ideas, and the
emergence of new intellectual, cultural, and linguistic communities and
practices. Particular emphasis is given to changing views and conceptions of
the traditional triad: 'Science, Nature, Man.' There will be a One Hour In-
Class Essay Exam in addition to a Take-Home Last Essay. Please note that
attendance is mandatory and participation is expected. Students may chose to
write an extra-credit Optional Research Essay; please see the _Study Guide_
and elsewhere at this WebSite for details. Office hours for Professor Hatch
are Tuesday, 3.00-6.00pm, and by appointment, 226 Keene-Flint Hall. Students
are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of Office Hours for
consultation and discussion. Telephone: 392.0271 (24h machine); E-Mail:

Evaluation  
  
All required work is announced on this syllabus; attendance is mandatory and
all requirements must be met to complete the course. Please note that this is
a demanding course involving substantial reading and writing, and hence,
careful preparation and planning are critical. Because a schedule is provided
in advance, absences and arrangements for late work **must** be approved in
advance. Please plan your course schedule and study commitments with care. A
basic rule of the course: When in doubt consult the syllabus, ask questions,
and read ahead. Finally, students are expected to read and understand a number
of items (concerning examinations, writing papers, secondary readings, etc.)
available at my posted WebSite.   This WebSite contains useful items
(bibliography, WebLinks, Search Engines, etc.) as well as practical guides on
writing Blue Book Exams, University level essays, and guidelines Reading &
Writing & Studying.  Students are responsible for reading this material early
in the course. Again, it is highly recommended that students 'Bookmark' this
page and consult the material regularly:
<http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages>  

* * *

Evaluation of course requirements takes five forms:

1\. Attendance is mandatory and the completion of corrolated readings (in
advance of the lecture) and comprehension of lecture material is required. All
course requirements listed here must be met to complete the course.  
2\. Participation in class discussion and activities is expected; there may be
unannounced quizzes and attendance may be monitored {Approximately 20%}  
3\. **Mid-Term Exam** : Tuesday, 2 October 2001 (30%) Written in-class 'Blue-
Book' Essay Exam. Please see the WebSite for guidelines and suggestions in
preparing for this exam.  
4\. **Take-home Essay** : **Nota Bene** : Due 12.00 Noon, Monday 10 December
2001 in Main History Department Office (Keene-Flint Hall). The Take-Home Essay
(c. 50%) is a written take-home essay limited to 1000 words, the equivalent of
five {5} typed pages, double spaced, typed {No Binders Please: Kindly Staple
Securely}. Please see the WebSite for suggestions in preparing and writing
this essay. Students should retain a photocopy of their work for backup
purposes. If you wish to have your essay returned, kindly supply a large
manilla envelope (9x12) with the appropriate postage and address, and I will
return your essay and final course grade by post. Essays will not otherwise be
retained or returned.  
5\. **Optional Term Papers** : 15-page research essay; due no later than 12.00
Noon, Friday, Week XIV. The optional paper provides extra credit and can add
as much as one letter to the final course grade. The paper is non compulsory;
no one is penalized for not choosing this option. The term paper allow
interested students to pursue a course topic in greater detail or to identify
an area not treated in this general survey course of readings and lectures.
Consider carefully whether you have sufficient time to do a proper job. The
Optional Paper should represent a solid and rewarding effort. It is possible
that your time would be better directed to the required readings. Required
reading increases in quantity, subtlety, and significance as the course aims
at the Last Take-home Essay. In all cases, the topic for the Optional Term
Paper must be approved by your instructor. Please consult the Study Guide and
the WebSite noted above for details regarding topic selection, approval,
submission timetables, general bibliography, and suggestions about research
and writing. As always, students should take advantage of Office Hours for
discussion and consultation.

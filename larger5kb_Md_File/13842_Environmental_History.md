**  Course description**

  This course will survey the major themes, books, and authors of
environmental history.  While global in scope, most of the common readings
will relate to the American experience.  Students will have ample opportunity,
however, to choose readings from elsewhere. The course involves heavy reading,
roughly a book a week.  The usual format will involve an oral presentation on
a book from the "elective" list for that week, followed by a general
discussion of the common reading.  (Those who make oral reports are not also
responsible for the common reading.) Students will make one or two reports
over the semester (depending on class size), for which they must submit a
written book review of 1000-1500 words.  For a  final paper, due on the last
day of class, the student should identify three items that struck his or her
interest and elaborate on them for 1500-3000 words.  Where appropriate, an
illustrated lecture will be offered.

NB: This syllabus is still under construction.  A final decision about
readings will depend on the actual enrollment the course attracts.

**Grades and Readings**

  * The common readings will be on 3-day reserve at Noble Library.   The ASU bookstore should also have them in stock.  the elective books are not on any kind of reserve; select, and claim, a volume early.
  * The smaller readings (less than full book) will be available in a course pack.
  * For guidelines to book reviews, see[ Guidelines.](writing.htm)

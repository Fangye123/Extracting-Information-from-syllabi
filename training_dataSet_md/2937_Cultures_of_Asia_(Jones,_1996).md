_COURSE GOALS:_

This course is designed to acquaint students with the land, peoples, and
cultures of Eastern Asia-from Burma to the Philippines and from inner Asia to
the Indonesian archipelago--as anthropologists have described them. The focus
of the course is on comparing and contrasting four major culture areas--China,
Japan, Mongolia and Tibet, and Southeast Asia with the emphasis on Vietnam.

_COURSE REQUIREMENTS:_

ASSIGNED READING; TESTS,; ATTENDANCE; GRADES  
To that end students must read five articles from the optional text which will
be put on reserve and three short ethnographies. There will be four, non-
cumulative exams which will include a variety of questions, including essays
and map exercises. Every student should have access to a good atlas or maps of
Asia to supplement the maps provided as handouts. Students will also be
provided with study guides for the ethnographies to aid in focused reading in
preparation for exams. Each exam will count 20% of the total grade and will be
worth 100 points. The grading scale is 90-100=A; 80-89=B; 70-79=C; 60-69=D.
You final grade will be based on the average of all your grades. I will take
attendance and attendance will be factored into final decision about grades.

PROJECT  
The other 20% of the grade will come from a research project on Vietnam.
Students may choose to do research with others in the class or the student may
work alone on an aspect of the culture of Vietnam. This research may include
any or all of the following: library research in books and journals,
internet/WWWeb information, museum visits, museum exhibits, interviews with
knowledgeable people, visits to Vietnamese establishments and businesses,
movies, records, and videos. The group or individual will present their
research to the class in a 15 or 20 minute oral presentation. The presentation
must include a complete bibliography and a short summary of the student(s)'s
research to give to the teacher and the other students in the class. I will
grade the presentation, summary, and bibliography and critique it in written
form. You _must_ do your presentation when scheduled unless you have arranged
to change the date ahead of time. If you do not, you will receive a zero on
the project.

Should the class have more than 15 students, students will have two other
options. Instead of an oral presentation students may: l)writing a short
research paper or 2) doing an interview with a person from Vietnam.
Instructions for these options will be given students later.

_EXPLANATION OF A255 "CULTURES OF ASIA" SYLLABUS_ **  
by Marjorie Jones Aug., 1996**

This course serves the following constituencies.  
1\. Students may take this course to meet their University Core
Curriculum[General Education] requirement for one 3-hour class in "Global
Communities".  
2\. Sociology students may count two anthropology courses towards their major
requirements in sociology. This course would count for a B.A. in Sociology.  
3\. Although we offer neither a major or a minor in anthropology, a number of
students elect to take all the courses offered in a four-year sequence to get
a concentration of 18-24 hours of anthropology classes. These students take
A255.  
4\. Students with an interest in Asia, including those non-degree-seeking
students from the community, who take the course when it is offered at night.
These often include students interested in the martial arts or Asian
religions.

The University of Southern Indiana is a four-year,state university with
between 7-8,000 students. It has been growing in enrollments every year and is
hard-pressed to keep up Classroom and office space are at a premium. The
school runs from 7:30 A.M. to 10:00 P.M. at night and on Saturday. We are on
the semester system and have three summer sessions. We have some graduate
programs. We are an open-admissions university with a student body that
includes many non-traditional students. .Most of our students work and many
have heavy family responsibilities, as well. Since money is tight for many of
our students, teachers have to be careful not to ask them to buy too many
books. Time is also scarce and teachers have to be realistic in their
expectations of what students will do outside class.

_A SHORT, ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF SELECTED WORKS FROM THE ANTHROPOLOGICAL
TREASURE ON ASIA_

The following list contains books that could be used by teachers of
undergraduate courses, either as sources for the teacher or texts for
students. I chose works in English for non-specialists in the field that are
general introductions to a whole country or works that are representative of
major ethnic groups or community studies that are typical in some way of the
larger country. I left out studies of small, disappearing, or non-
representative groups like those on the Ainu of Japan or the hunting and
gathering societies of Malaysia or the Philippines even though these are often
of interest to anthropologists for theoretical reasons. (For example, the
Semai of Malaysia are of interest to scientists whose research explores the
possibility of a society in which there is no expression of violence.)

Given the rapid pace of change in many parts of Asia, I concentrated on books
reporting recent research. The focus of the course "Cultures of Asia" is
contemporary peoples and cultures. For that reason some of the classic works
in anthropology are left out--classics like: I ) Margaret Mead and Gregory
Bateson's photographic essay, _Balinese Character,_ based on field work done
in the 1930ties and published in 1942; 2) Ruth Benedict's _The Chrysanthemum
and the Sword_ , based on research on Japanese character for the Defense
Department and published at the end of World War II; 3) Martin Yang's famous
study, _A Chinese Village: Taitou, Shantung Province_ , published in 1945; 4)
the social anthropologist Edmund Leach's study, done behind Japanese lines
during World War II, published in 1954 as _Political Systems of Highland
Burma: A Study of Kachin Social Structure;_ 5) Clifford and Hildred Geertz'
field work in Java and Bali in the 1950ties, reflected in Clifford Geertz'
_Peddlars and Princes_ (1963) or their joint work, _Kinship in Bali_ (1975);
6) Ronald Dore's research in urban Japan in the 1950ties in _City Life in
Japan: a Study of a Tokyo Ward_ (1958) and rural life in _Shinohata_ (1973);
7) Norma Diamond's _K'un Shen: a Taiwan Village._

Concentrating on recent publications based on research done in the last 15
years, presents a problem, however. Authoritarian regimes, warfare, hostility
to non-communist or foreign researchers in general, or hostility to the whole
enterprise of social science research on the grounds that such research does
not serve state purposes (isn't "useful") and serves colonial/ imperial
purposes have closed whole countries to anthropologists for many years. For
example research has been difficult or impossible in Myanmar, North Korea, and
Vietnam and until recently also in Laos, Cambodia, China, Tibet, and Mongolia.
To give an example, the only community studies done by anthropologists in
Vietnam date to the Vietnam war. Gerald Cannon Hickey's monograph on a Mekong
River delta peasant community, _Village in Vietnam,_ was published in 1964 and
his recent publications on the hill tribes of Vietnam are historical
treatments. In other words, for some part.s of Asia, there no, or very few,
good quality anthropological studies accessible to undergraduate students or
their teachers.

The following list consists of a small; number of books and monograph.s that
would be excellent sources for teachers or possible text.s for undergraduate
students. The asterisk (*) indicates those that might be suitable texts.

I. **_JAPAN_** _:  
_ A. **General Introductions:**

1\. Befu, Harumi 1971 _Japan: an Anthropological Introduction_. Chandler; San
Francisco.  
* I used this as a general introduction to Japan until it went out of print. It's still available in many libraries. The chapters on history, culture and personality, art style are especially useful. He is a well-known Japanese anthropologist married to an American. He has published many articles and other books.

2\. Hendry, Joy 1995 _Understanding Japanese Society. 2nd ed._ Routledge:
London.  
* Joy Hendry is a social anthropologist who has published extensively on many aspects Japanese life. This work includes chapters on all aspects of culture, including history and popular culture, as well as the usual sections on work, family, and community, etc. A very useful features of this book is that she cites her references at the end of each chapter with suggestions for further reading, including novels and other  "light reading".

3\. Lebra, Takie Sugiyama 1976 _Japanese Patterns of Behavior._ University of
Hawaii Press: Honolulu.  
* The book arise from Lebra's attempts to teach students something about the culture of Japan and Japanese behavior at the University of Hawaii. Her focus is primarily on  "Ethos" or world view and values. She includes chapters of deviance and the _Yakuza._ suicide, and treatment of deviant behavior, topics not covered well in the other books cited.

4\. Hendry, Joy and Jonathan Webber 1986 _Interpreting Japanese Society:
Anthropological Approaches._ JASO Occasional Papers #5: Oxford. This monograph
contains articles on contemporary Japanese world view, religion, and leisure-
time activities.

B. **Specific Subjects:**

5\. Imamura, Anne. 1987 _Urban Japanese Housewives: At Home and in the
Community_ University of Hawaii Press: Honolulu.  
*Anne Imamura is an American sociologist, whose husband is Japanese. She studied the lives of middle-class women in a Tokyo suburb in 1977-78.

6\. Hendry, Joy 1981 _Marriage in Changing Japan: Community and Society_ St.
Martin's Press: New York.

7\. Hendry, Joy 1986 _Becoming Japanese: The World of the Preschool Child._
Manchester University Press: Manchester  
*While the topic is education and socialization, it is a great source for those interested in the Japanese world view as well.

8\. Bestor, Thomas 1983 _Japan's High Schools._ University of California
Press: Berkeley. This is another famous anthropological study of Japanese
education from the perspective of high schools.

9\. Feiler, Bruce S. 1991 _Learning to Bow: Inside the Heart of Japan._
Tickenor  & Fields: New York.  
* Feiler is a Japanese-speaking teacher of English who spend a year in a junior high school in Tochigi Prefecture in the town of Sano north of Tokyo in the Middle of Honshu. In the course of reading about his experience, the intense "groupism" of Japanese culture is clear including the tragedies of those who don't fit in (returnees from abroad and the Burakumin/Eta or outcastes).

C. **Community Studies:**

10\. Norbeck, Edward 1984 _Changing Japan._ 2nd ed. Waveland Press: Prospect
heights, Ill.  
* Waveland Press publishes many good paperback ethnographies written specifically for undergraduates. Many are reissues of classic works from the 1960ties and 70ties, Some have been updated by the anthropologists and some have not. This book follows a family's fortunes from the rural south as the younger generation gets an education and one becomes a  "salaryman" in Tokyo. However, Japanese who read it tell me that it is out of date. Norbeck began his research 30 years ago.

11\. Bestor, T.C. 1986 _Neighborhood Tokyo_. Stanford University Press:
Stanford, Cal.  
I have not seen this work, but it's often cited by other anthropologists.

II. **_CHINA_**

A. **Regional Studies:**

1\. Parish, William L. And martin King Whyte 1978 _Village and Family in
Contemporary China._ University of Chicago Press: Chicago.  
China was closed to western sociological and anthropological research in the
70ties, for the most part, so Parish and Whyte studied peasant life and later
urban life in Guangdong Province by systematic interviewing of recently
arrived peasants, first, and later, urban immigrants to Hong Kong. The books
are a useful starting point for teachers, even though they are a little out-
of-date.

2\. Whyte, Martin K. And William L. Parish 1984 _Urban Life In China._
University of Chicago Press: Chicago.

**B. Community Studies:**

3\. Chance, Norman 1991 _China's Urban Villagers: Changing Life in a Beijing
Suburb._ 2nd ed. Holt,  
* Rinehart, and Winston: Ft. Worth. Fred Engst, born of American parents in China, grew up in China and was a research collaborator with Chance. Engst experienced the Tiananmen Square massacre and its aftermath. The focus of the book is on peasant life and the changes this commune has undergone since 1949.

4\. Huang, Shiu-min 1989 _The Spiral Road: Change in a Chinese Village through
the Eves of a Communist  
_ * _Party Leader._ Westrow Press: Boulder. The anthropologist studied in the
coastal areas of Guangdong and Fujian provinces. He describes the changes in
one area through the words of a party leader, a technique anthropologist call
the life-history method.

5\. Hinton, William 1983 _Shenfan: Continuing Revolution in a Chinese
Village._ Random House: New York. Hinton is also the author of the classic
_Fanshen: A Documentary of Revolutionary Change in a Chinese Village._
(Vintage Books: New York)

III. **_INNER ASIA: MONGOLIA AND TIBET_**

1\. Goldstein, Melvyn c. And Cynthia M. Beall 1990 _Nomads of Western Tibet:
the Survival of a Way of Life._ University of California Press: Berkeley.

2\. 1994 _The Changing World of Mongolia's Nomads._ University of Cal Press:
Berkeley.  
* Goldstein and Beall studied both Tibetan and Mongolian pastoral nomads. Their research in Tibet in 1988 and in Mongolia in 1990 was conducted by the method of participant observation. They actually lived with the nomads. Their research in Mongolia spanned the change from Marxist collectives under a regime with strong ties to Russia to a market economy in an independent state. These **books are** unusual in modern anthropology. **Not only are** they written for a general audience, the authors provide a visual ethnography in the beautiful color photographs which are fully integrated into the texts.

IV. **_SOUTHEAST ASIA_**

1\. Evans, Grant 1990 _Lao Peasants under Socialism._ Yale University Press:
New Haven. Evans was allowed to study rural peasant villages and cooperatives
near Vientiane from 1982- 1987.

2\. Long, Lyellyn C. 1993 _Ban Vinai: the Refugee Camp._ Columbia U. Press:
New York. Ban Vinai is a refugee camp in northeastern Thailand for Laotians
and Cambodians.

3\. Lansing, J. Stephen 1995 _The Balinese._ Harcourt Brace: Ft. Worth.  
* This paperback is one of the series of case studies in anthropology written for use by under-graduates that used to be published by Holt, Rinehart, and Winston and now is Harcourt and Brace. Lansing first did research in the 1970ties on the arts. Since arts and crafts production were often found in association with temples, he became aware of the ecological role of temples in the management of water and his research went off in another direction. He arranged to have the island-wide world renewal ceremony held only every 100 years filmed in 1979. The film is available as  "The Three Worlds of Bali". His 1988 film and water temple and farming is also available as "The Goddess and the Computer".

4\. Sultive, Vinson H., Jr. 1988 _The Iban of Sarawak: The Chronicles of a
Vanishing World._ Waveland: Porspect  
* Heights, Il. This is one paperback from the Waveland series of ethnographies for undergraduate which takes a look at the way in which a tribal population is adapting to a modern world.

V. _GENERAL:_

1\. Evansv, Grant, ed. 1993 _Asia's Cultural Mosaic: An Anthropological
Introduction_. Prentice-Hall: New York.  
This book is a topical introduction to Asia rather than a regional one and
includes material on India as well. It is rather complex for a textbook for
freshman and sophomore-level courses as a whole. I choose a few select
chapters to put on reserve, rather than try to use the whole book.

**_Examinations_**

There will be five examinations in this course. All examinations will consist
of a combination of multiple- choice,
[essays](http://www.ipfw.edu/ipfwhist/syllabi/h232/essays.htm) and short-
answer questions. On examinations students will be expected to demonstrate an
understanding of the lectures and readings and to use these materials to
explain both major events and broad twentieth century historical trends. On
each examination students will have the option of taking an all multiple-
choice examination or an examination which combines essays with multiple
choice questions. Students must take a minimum of two essay/multiple-choice
examinations: Exam III and any other examination. Each examination will count
20% of the course grade.

Exams I, II, III, and IV cannot be made up. For students who miss any of these
examinations, there will be a comprehensive make-up examination administered
in lieu of Exam V, and this examination will count for Exam V as well as for
any examination(s) missed. The comprehensive examination will consist of 50
multiple-choice questions and three essays. Students must receive credit for
all examinations in order to receive a passing grade in the course. (NOTE: If
the comprehensive exam is being used to satisfy essay requirements, then a
passing grade must be received for the essays in order to pass the course.)

The exams are tentatively scheduled for 15 September, 13 October, 3 November,
17 November, and 10:30 on 11 December (noon section) and 13 December (11 a.m.
section).

**_Class Participation_**

While no specific grade is awarded for in-class participation, such
participation can be a factor in the determination of the course grade. Credit
can be earned for contributions to class discussions. Students are encouraged
to ask questions and make observations before and during lectures. The
assigned readings are intended to supplement and expand upon the lectures, and
not all materials in the readings will be covered in lectures. Therefore, if
the readings require explanation, students are expected to avail themselves of
the discussion periods to seek clarification. As much time as necessary will
be devoted to these discussions.

**_Electronic Devices/Students with Disabilities_**

Department of History policy prohibits the use of **recording devices** in the
classroom unless there is a special need. Students with such needs should
consult with the instructor. Please turn off your **cell phones** and
**beepers** before coming to class.

If you have or acquire a disability and would like to find out what special

Courses Offered  
Fall Semester 1999  
[**Schedule of Classes**](fall99.html)

**J 200 Reporting the News**

Lydia Chavez, William Drummond, Cynthia Gorney,  
Neil Henry, Susan Rasky

Journalism 200,  "Reporting the News," is the required core course for all
first year students taken during the first semester. This course, an intensive
15-week workshop, provides the foundation for the rest of the curriculum and
will take up much of the entering student's time in the fall. J200 stresses
hard news reporting, writing, and editing. In classes of no more than 12
students, faculty members with extensive experience in newspaper reporting run
their classes much like newsrooms. The aim is to produce publishable newspaper
stories. Many class assignments do end up in print,  
sometimes in newspaper published by the school and often in local dailies,
weeklies, and regional newspapers. Entering students may take just one
additional 2 unit background course so they can devote adequate time to this
seminal and time-consuming course.

**Note: The J200 Assembly, from 12-2 in the Library each Monday, is required.
Three additional weekly sessions on copy-editing with Andrea Behr will also be
assigned and scheduled by your J200 instructor.

  
**J210 News Photography**

Ken Light

This class provides an overview of photojournalism and news photography that
includes learning basic photographic skills, from camera controls to exposure
and film selection. Students shoot news and street photographic assignments
and work on in-house Journalism School publications; they have the opportunity
to develop film, work with Photoshop or use the school black and white
darkroom as well as having  
their work critiqued.

Ken Light, curator of the Photojournalism Center at the School, is the author
of five monographs including Texas Death Row.

  
**J298/12 Advanced Photojournalism/Magazine Photography**

Ken Light

An exploration of magazine photography as applied to photo essay, day
assignments and book projects, as well as content based lectures (location
lighting, environmental portraiture, etc.) and critiques. Students work on in-
depth assignments that include research, reporting and photographing.
Legal/ethical and business issues are explored, including fund-raising and
grant writing to support extended projects.

  
**J227/1 Reporting on Culture**

Laura Sydell

In this class we will analyze and practice various forms of cultural reporting
-- feature, commentary, interview, obit, criticism, art news reporting. We
will also discuss trends that have shaped the art of our time and its
relationship to the society that has produced it. This will include an
examination of the economic, political and historical forces shaping culture
and how those forces influence which artists get support and coverage. Certain
central questions will be discussed: What is the role of arts and  
cultural reporters in today's society? How can we create stories that are more
than just puff pieces about the arts? How can our stories provide the public
with a sense of perspective about culture and still be engaging and
interesting? Students will look at these questions in the light of stories
they will report on using the Bay Area as their laboratory. Students with a
special interest in one artistic discipline may focus most of their
assignments in that area. There will be an emphasis on reporting for radio,
but the class is open to print and television reporters with an interest in
arts and culture.  
Students are not required to have special training in the arts, but they must
have a fundamental appreciation of and intellectual curiosity about culture
and the forces that shape it.

Laura Sydell, the Teaching Fellow on Research, has been a reporter for
National Public Radio and for WNYC in New York.

  
**J227/2 Art of the Book Review**

Steve Wasserman

This course will examine the history of book reviewing over the course of the
past 50 years: how newspapers, magazines and journals have treated the
publication of books as news. It will survey the present landscape of
contemporary journalism with a special emphasis on cultural coverage. In
addition, students will be expected to write weekly reviews of current and
forthcoming books for possible publication.

Steve Wasserman is Book Editor of the Los Angeles Times and is former
editorial director of Times Books, a division of Random House, Inc., as well
as past publisher of Hill and Wang and Noonday Press, both divisions of
Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Inc.

  
**J230/1 Business Reporting**  
**Financial Journalism: The Jobs, Cult of Personality and  
Gatekeepers**

Andrew Leckey

The course considers the basic knowledge required and the career opportunities
in financial journalism--the fastest growing field in journalism. It details
types of broadcast, print and Internet financial coverage and the audiences
they target. It examines the cult of personality in which chief executives are
today's media stars and explains how journalists can scale the walls that
corporations build around themselves.

Andrew Leckey is a former CNBC Cable Television Network anchor and reporter
and nationally-syndicated investment columnist who has written five books on
investing. He created the annual "Global Investing" series published by Warner
Books, and has been a contributing writer to Columbia University textbooks on
financial journalism.

  
**J230/2 Writing on Business: A Focus on Silicon Valley**

Michael Lewis and Louis Rossetto

This course will attempt to teach students how to approach a Big Topic in
business and make it their own. Students will write one 3000 word article
about a business subject of their choice -- preferably something to do with
Silicon Valley -- with a view to publishing in a general interest magazine.
About one third of the class time will be given over to a workshop of student
pieces. Though the class will, of course, try to learn something about writing
it will also try to make itself expert on Silicon Valley, out of the
instructor's belief that you can't write about anything well unless you
understand it  
in ways others do not.

Michael Lewis, a Koret Teaching Fellow, is a contributing writer to the New
York Times Magazine and author of The New New Thing: A Silicon Valley Story,
which will be published in fall of 1999.  
Louis Rossetto is founder of Wired Magazine.

  
**J234/1 Covering Asia**

Carolyn Wakeman, Robert Templer, Todd Carrel, Orville Schell

Financial Crisis? Social meltdown? Political tumult? Dictators and  
democrats? Flexing missile muscles? The fabric of everyday life? How might you
report from an outpost in Asia? And what would you report? This course will
look at selected countries of Asia from the inside out and the outside in --
with perspectives, analysis and guidance from commentators here and
journalists posted there. How to research and prepare for reporting; how to
get to sources; how to divine and define the story and get it in print or on
the air. Students will pitch story ideas and develop background information on
different countries as they learn approaches to covering international news.

  
**J234/2 International Reporting**  
Nightmares: Covering Political Conflict and Global  
Catastrophe in the Next Millennium

Mark Danner and Peter Tarnoff

We will closely examine scenarios for political conflict in coming years,
working to understand how such conflicts might begin, how they might be
managed, and how they might be resolved. Through lectures, readings, and
enacting scenarios we will explore the changing character of international
relations and global crises, and try to prepare journalists for a broader,
more complex sort of story. For example: Pakistan and India reach a nuclear
confrontation; the Ebola virus kills millions in Central and begins to  
spread to the rest of Africa and other continents; nuclear-armed terrorists
vow to detonate a weapon in New York if their extreme demands are not met; an
ever more powerful China and an economically desperate Russia cement an anti-
Western alliance; millions of starving North Koreans march towards South
Korea. We will analyze the background of each crisis; anticipate what the
responses might be from US and officials from key foreign governments; and
study the strategies journalists would follow to cover such stories.

Mark Danner is a Senior Research Fellow at the Human Rights Center and a
Visiting Professor at the School of Journalism. Since 1990, Danner has been a
writer at The New Yorker, and he is the author of The Massacre at El Mozote

until 1997, was Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs. He is
currently President of the International Advisory Corporation in San
Francisco.

  
**J234/3 Reporting the Arab-Israeli Conflict**

Ori Nir

This course will study the complexities of covering the Arab-Israeli conflict,
with a strong emphasis on the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. It
will examine some of the main problems facing reporters who cover the
conflict. The chief objective is to equip students with tools for digging deep
into a foreign culture and interpreting it for their readers. The Israeli-
Palestinian conflict will serve as a case study. How do you gather information
in societies where the mass media is restrained by the government, where
information does not flow freely and people are suspicious and xenophobic? How
do you maintain balance in a situation where everybody expects everybody to
take sides? How to watch for  
Western biases in covering Middle Eastern cultures? How do the domestic media
function? How do you handle culturally sensitive issues: religion,
superstition, controversial customs? These are some of the questions that the
course examines. Reading: mainly ongoing press coverage of the conflict,
selected articles and excerpts from books by foreign correspondents. Writing:
a couple of opinion pieces or news analyses on the conflict during the
semester, and one short term paper.

Ori Nir, an Israeli journalist, has covered the Arab-Israeli conflict for more
than a decade for Israel's leading daily, Ha'aretz, serving as the paper's
Palestinian affairs correspondent and its US. bureau chief in Washington, DC.

  
**J249 Media and Society In Contemporary** China

Carolyn Wakeman

Essential background for journalism students preparing to report in Asia--this
lecture and discussion course will examine the crucial role  
played by the media in the establishment, perpetuation and decline of  
Communist Party authority in China. Students will analyze the  
development and the impact of the mass media (newspapers and magazines,  
radio and television) and of the popular media (revolutionary opera,  
film, short fiction, wall posters, cartoons) from the period of the  
Communist victory and the Korean War through the Cultural Revolution,  
the Democracy Movement of 1989 and the economic reforms of the  
mid-1990s. Readings will focus on the changing role of the media in  
society, the tension between officials and audiences, and the impact of  
new technology on politics.

Carolyn Wakeman, a member of the permanent faculty, is coordinator of the
Asian Studies/Journalism concurrent degree program.

  
**J250 Investigative Reporting**

Tim Reiterman

This two-semester course will emphasize the development, reporting and writing
of in-depth newspaper projects. The goal is to build publishable projects from
the ground up while working in a team setting. The course work includes three
hours a week of classroom instruction, discussion and guest lectures, plus
field reporting. The course work and readings will focus on investigative
reporting techniques, including public records, applications of computer-
assisted reporting, legal and ethical considerations, and the operations and
standards of major newspapers.

Tim Reiterman, the Schumann Teaching Fellow in Investigative Reporting, is the
State Projects Editor of the Los Angeles Times. He helped direct reporters in
the Pulitzer prize winning coverage of the 1992 Los Angeles riots and the 1994

Untold Story of the Rev. Jim Jones and His People and co-editor of a Los
Angeles Times book, Understanding the Riots.

  
**J282 Introduction to Television News**

Joan Bieder, Paul Mason, and Linda Schacht

Students will learn the basic tools of television in this introductory course
-- writing and reporting for broadcast, shooting, and Avid editing. They will
report and produce 2 -3 minute television news stories and produce a full half
hour television news program at the end of the semester. For the first time
this year we will divide the course into two constituencies : First year
students will learn the basics, but still concentrate their time on J-200.
Second year students will be on an accelerated track within J 282. Building  
on their first year reporting skills, and free of the J-200 constraints, the
second year students will master the digital cameras and editing systems early
and begin to produce more sophisticated work with an emphasis on experimenting
with new forms of television news.

Joan Bieder is a former producer for ABC News and permanent member of the
faculty; Paul Mason, a permanent member of the faculty, produces for ABC News;
Linda Schacht is a reporter for the CBS affiliate KPIX-TV in San Francisco

  
**J298/11 Advanced Television News**

  
Joan Bieder, Paul Mason, and Linda Schacht

  
**J275 Radio News**

George Lewinski

This course teaches basic radio, including  "writing for the ear," analog and
digital recording and editing, news and news feature story preparation and
voice coaching. The centerpiece of the course is a weekly half-hour magazine
program broadcast over KALX-FM on Thursday mornings. Students are expected to
fully participate in the preparation of the program, assuming all the roles
necessary to produce it.

George Lewinski is a correspondent of the radio program MarketPlace.

  
**J284 Documentary Production**

  
Jon Else

  
**J285 Television Magazine**

Joan Bieder and Paul Mason  
(J282 and J283 are prerequisites.)

This is a one semester course that builds on the foundations of J 282 and 283
and will emphasize in-depth reporting. This visual story telling course will
emphasize structuring stories that set a scene, develop central characters,
employ elements of tension and arc to a peak or climax. Students will learn
advanced lighting and camera techniques, read narrative texts, view examples
of television magazine stories and employ their own reporting skills to
produce two stories. In the first assignment, each  
student will profile an individual involved in a social or political event,
follow the character through the event and build a simple story of three to
four minutes. The class will then break into reporting teams and spend three
weeks researching and reporting a second story. Emphasis will be placed on
deeper reporting and include document research, archival footage as
appropriate. Students will spend the final 6 weeks shooting and editing the
story. This is a one semester course although some students may discover their
thesis projects in the class.

  
**J298/1 New Media Publishing**

Scholle Sawyer and Jason Snell

This class will introduce you to the major technical, legal, editorial,  
and ethical issues the Web poses for journalists today. The purpose of  
the class will be to make you Internet literate. By the end of this class, you
will be qualified to write about Internet-related topics with some degree of
authority. You will also be able to create a Web site with both text and
images, and will learn important editorial principles that will make you a
more well-rounded 21st-century journalist.  
If you've never surfed the Web, this is your chance to learn what  
everyone's talking about and get the basic skills you need. If you've had a
web site up since 1994 and got your first J200 scoop off a Usenet newsgroup,
this is your chance to fill any holes in your knowledge and think about the
full impact the Web can have on your role as a journalist.  
During the last half of the semester, you will write an article related  
to some aspect of new media and self-publish it on the web using Macromedia
Dreamweaver. As you plan and report the article you'll be  
responsible for thinking about how best to use the Web to tell your story and
gathering any additional materials such as photographs, sounds, video clips,
and the like.

Jason Snell is Executive Editor of Macworld and Scholle Sawyer is Senior
Editor at Macworld.

  
**J298/2 Writing for the Web**  
  
Gail Evenari and David Neiman

Students research, write and produce a Web site, which will be launched as a
companion to a documentary series about heroism in America. The Web site, an
interactive multimedia timeline, will cover five decades of  
20th century America with a focus on the heroes who emerged during those  
periods. Working in pairs, students will build a portion of the timeline  
using historical summaries, biographies, still images, archival footage,  
periodical excerpts and interviews with scholars. They will then combine  
the various media using HTML, Photoshop, RealProducer, and other  
technologies. The course will also feature weekly analyses of selected  
sites on the Web, as well as guest speakers, including writers, historians and
accomplished professionals in the fields of digital media and film production.

Gail Evenari is a documentary filmmaker and David Neimanis is a producer at
PBS Online.

  
**J298/3 Creating a Magazine**

Clay Felker

This course will explore in both theoretical and practical ways of creating a
magazine from scratch. Students will be actively involved in the entire
process, from conceiving story ideas to learning how to report and write from
a point of view, learning how to represent and present ideas graphically, and
participating in the editing and desktop production before the final magazine
is printed.  
Here's the basic idea of the magazine we'll create: At the end of a
millennium, a new kind of city -- let's call it The Information City -- is
being created in the San Francisco Bay Area. This is one of the most dramatic
and significant urban developments of our time. It introduces a pattern of
discontinuity in the material basis of the economy, society and culture. This
is a complex and combustible combination of exploding science and technology,
along with the tectonic shift in multicultural diversity, an extraordinary
expansion of global capitalism, a crisis of patriarchy and the nation-state.
The result is a development, in the Bay Area, of a new kind of city (perhaps
even another type of city-state). This historic process is the event that the
course will examine, through the creation of a new experimental magazine,
perhaps  
called i-Bay, or i-City. As the center of power in the area shifts from the
city of San Francisco down to San Jose and the environs of Silicon Valley, a
new urban entity is being spawned. The exploration of elements of this new
information city will be the subject of the course. Writing assignments will
teach how to interpret the meaning and significance of the subject, based on
extensive reporting.

Clay Felker, the founding editor of New York magazine and former editor of
Esquire, Manhattan, Inc., and the Village Voice (among others), is the
director of the Felker Magazine Center.

  
**J298/4 Computer Assisted Reporting**

Paul Grabowicz

Students learn how journalists are using the Internet to help report stories.
They get instruction in using Web search engines and subject guides, exploring
information databases on the Web, using news groups and discussion lists, and
finding sources and interviewing people on-line. They also learn how to use
spreadsheet and database programs, and how to do a basic Web page. And they
get an overview of the world of on-line publishing and the problems that new
media poses for the press and society.  
[Syllabus](syllabi/car-syl.html)

Paul Grabowicz, coordinator of the New Media Program and interim director of
the School, is the co-author of California, Inc.

**J298/6 Desktop Publishing**

Kelly Lunsford

Students learn desktop publishing techniques, including use of  
QuarkXPress and PhotoShop, and the elements of designing a print publication.
Students handle the production of the newspapers for the  
introductory reporting classes in the Fall semester, as well as publications
for other classes.

  
**J298/7 Globalization and the News**

Francis Pisani

In April 1999, a Pulitzer Prize went to Richard Read, a journalist who told
the story of a load of frozen french fries transported between Oregon and
Indonesia to help his readers understand the financial crisis in Asia whose
consequences they were suffering. Thomas Friedman, the New York Times Foreign
Affairs columnist, published The Lexus and the Olive Tree. In the global
world, he says, the value added by journalists lies in their capacity to
explain the connection between politics, culture, security, financial markets,
technology and environment at a global level. Journalists should convey that
complexity to readers through simple stories. Journalists will soon discover
that it has become impossible to cover almost any subject \-- local or
national,  
business or environment -- without a reasonable understanding of its
international dimensions. Students will be invited to a critical reading of
the international section of some newspapers (international reporting as it is
done today). Through an intensive use of the internet they will go beyond the
mundane view and get a 3D perspective on what is happening  "out there." One
case study (immigration, drug trafficking or web publishing) will help them
grasp the multiple connections (politics, culture, technology,  
etc.) at play in any given situation. Students will report on the
international dimensions of a local business or community.

Francis Pisani is the West Coast Technology Correspondent for the French daily
Le Monde and the Spanish daily El Pais.

  
**J298/8 Election 2000, Part 1**

Susan Rasky

This course is part 1 of a two-semester sequence on the presidential election
of 2000. It's a background course that will consist primarily of reading and
discussion. We'll focus on the suburban electorate. Politicians, political
advisors, and political journalists involved in coverage will visit the class.
Spring semester will include travel, coverage of primaries, and production of
a magazine. Both semesters will emphasize the pursuit of suburban votes by
presidential candidates -- and the implications of this emphasis on suburbia
for national politics.

Susan Rasky, a permanent member of the faculty, is the former chief
congressional correspondent for the New York Times.

  
**J298/9 Environmental Reporting**

Paul Rogers

There's more to environmental reporting than re-writing Sierra Club press
releases. The course will present a broad overview of one of the most diverse,
controversial and exciting journalism assignments -- covering the environment
beat. Students will learn how to identify stories, build relationships with
sources, separate important news from hyperbole and craft compelling coverage.
Other topics will include deciphering scientific journals, evaluating risk,
using history and politics to establish perspective and exploring computer-
assisted reporting. The course will include substantial  "real world"
experiences, culminating with final writing assignments that will be submitted
for publication in the Science Section of the San Jose Mercury News.

Paul Rogers, the Hewlett Teaching Fellow in Environmental Reporting, is the  
environment writer for the San Jose Mercury News. He was part of the Mercury
News team that won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for coverage of the Loma Prieta
earthquake.

  
**J298/10 The Art of Interviewing**

Tabitha Soren

The aim of this class is to teach students how to prepare, conduct and edit
interviews for print, radio and television. Students will learn how to
interview all sorts of people: shy people, mean people, long-winded people,
celebrities, obscurities, etc. The class is more of a workshop than a seminar,
though it combines elements of both. The first half of each class will be
devoted to role-playing interview exercises, the second half to reading,
watching and critiquing the interviews of others. Many of the classes will  
include guests who will relate their own experiences with interviews, and then
serve themselves up as guinea pigs for students to interview. It's assumed
that there is no single  "right" way to interview-that each student will
develop his own interviewing style, his own approach to his subjects.

Tabitha Soren has worked as a television reporter for ABC's Vermont affiliate,
NBC News and MTV Networks, where she won a Peabody award and is currently
employed. She has written a column syndicated by the New York Times as well as
feature stories for magazines.

  
**Independent Study  
Investigative Reporting for Print and Television/Second year and Post Grad
Students**

Lowell Bergman

Five to six students will be admitted to a special advanced reporting class
that will be involved in research and reporting on two to three hours of  
documentaries being produced out of the Frontline office at UC Berkeley as  
well as research for investigative stories for the New York Times.  
Two of the documentary hours are part of series on the War on Drugs for airing
in the Fall of 2000. Students with a facility in Spanish will be given  
preference. These hours will focus on the Mexican drug cartels as well as the  
cost of the drug war on society.  
The print investigative stories will involve research into the technical  
operations of federal law enforcement when it is conducting electronic  
eavesdropping. A second research area is the legal responsibilities governing  
the use of the broadcast airwaves by the television networks. Do they have an  
obligation to broadcast in the public interest?

Lowell Bergman was a former 60 Minutes producer for Mike Wallace and is
currently a PBS Correspondent .

  
**J298/13 Web Editorial Strategies**

Marcia Parker

This course is designed to give students interested in developing  
editorial content for web sites several unique opportunities. One is a chance
to learn from the ground up how editorial content becomes a key part of the
strategy of a product company, in this case Intuit, a $5 billion maker of
personal finance, small business, tax and other software, as it evolves into a
multimedia financial services company. Another is to help develop and
implement the editorial strategy for the website, as well as produce content
for that website, which is www.Quickbooks.com. The third is to report on small
business.  
Quickbooks is software for small businesses and the site is presently  
primarily a product site. The goal is to make it a destination site for small
businesses seeking news, information and resources. Students will be engaged
in the process of evaluating and creating fresh ideas for the website (such as
hosting online conferences, posting stories with audio and visual elements,
seeking out information partners, as well as writing original news and feature
stories. There will likely be opportunities for website design and production.
Students may work at Intuit's headquarters in Mt. View from time to time. In
many ways you may be acting as interns on the site, but with the additional
opportunity to learn about the process by which editorial content takes shape
in a company like Intuit.  
Guest speakers will include other Intuit employees in the company who are
engaged in the development of the website, as well as small business experts
who we may want to tap for their creative ideas. Like many product companies,
Intuit has hired a handful of journalists to develop editorial content for
their websites. More and more journalists are joining the ranks of these
companies and it is fascinating to see how they work, what they do and how
they negotiate the world of new media in a product and services company. These
journalists encounter a host of opportunities as well as issues and obstacles
that others who are working for the websites of  
"pure" editorial operations do not.  
To take the course, you should have an interest in new media and small
business, including writing for and about small business. Coverage of small
business, which includes entrepreneurs and all the issues that are  
important to them, plus the fast growing home-based businesses, is growing
dramatically in print and broadcast. Anyone with an interest in business
reporting and or new media will gain valuable insight and experience in this
course.

Marcia Parker is the newly hired managing editor of the site and this is her
first foray into new media. Ms. Parker is a lecturer here and former director
of Industry Outreach and Student Services at the Journalism School. A veteran
business reporter and editor, she served as business editor and later managing
editor for the Contra Costa newspapers now owned by Knight Ridder. She has
been a reporter and editor for several publications including Crain's New York  
Business. Ms. Parker has a masters degree in international affairs from the
Fletcher School at Tufts University. She was an adjunct professor at Columbia
University's Graduate School of Journalism for more than a decade, teaching
the core reporting course, plus business, investigative and public records
reporting. Ms. Parker has continued to conduct newsroom management and
training for various news organizations.

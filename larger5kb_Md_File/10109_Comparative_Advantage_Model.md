Here are the technical details to comparative advantage:

  * Goods: two, " **wine"** and " **cloth"** (measured, respectively in "casks" and "bolts")
  * Countries: two, " **England"** and " **Portugal"**
  * Factors of production: one, " **labor** "

> This, in other words, is a 2 x 2 x 1 model. This is a minimalist model; the
bulk of trade theory uses a more complicated 2 x 2 x 2 model with two factors
of production, "capital" and "labor." Perhaps counter to your intuition,
little is gained by moving to more complex models (more than 2 countries, or
adding "land" as a production factor, or introducing multiple goods).

  * Supply: in order to specify the production side of the economy we need (i) a production technology and (ii) an allocation of the factors of production.   

    * Resources: each country has **10 "units"** of labor.
    * Technology: we will use the simplest possible production process, a linear one. Each unit of labor produces a fixed number of units, so that output is in direct proportion to the number of workers. This implies no diminishing returns, but not much generality is lost since there is only one factor of production.

> Example: If wine production technology is **"6"** then (given 10 units of
labor) output will be zero with 0 units allocated to the industry, 6 with one
unit, 12 with 2 and so on to a maximum of 60 .

  * Production details: to come up with a concrete model, let's use the following numbers. I've chosen them to make the arithmetic work out nicely. Changing the numbers won't affect the ultimate conclusion - we could make Portugal "4" and "8" instead of "4" and "1."

|  | Wine | Cloth  
---|---|---  
England | 6 | 4  
Portugal | 4 | 1  
  
England is thus more productive - has an **absolute** advantage - over
Portugal in the production of both goods. If (for example) Portugal were to
allocate labor equally among the two industries - 5 units of labor to each -
it would produce 20 casks of wine and 5 bolts of cloth. With a similar
allocation, England would produce 30 casks and 20 bolts. While this would not
eliminate the disadvantage of English weather, the British stiff upper lip
would be partly a smug smirk, since they would be both better dressed and in
better spirits than their Portuguese counterparts.

Note that this also gives us the **prices** of the two goods. Without money
all that matters is the rate at which they trade for each other. In Portugal,
the opportunity cost of producing more cloth is less wine. Specifically, 4
casks must be given up to produce 1 bolt of cloth. (Obviously, one worker has
to shift from the vineyards to the textile mills.) The price, then, is 4:1 -
that is, the price of a bolt of cloth is 4 casks of wine, or p C=+4. Likewise,
in England 6 casks of wine must be given up to get 4 bolts of cloth, for a 6:4
ratio. In other words, pC=1.5. Cloth is **comparatively** cheap in England,
and so we say that England has a **comparative** advantage in cloth
production. Similarly, Portugal holds a **comparative** advantage in wine
production.

  * Demand: But how much labor to each good? Here we need to "close" the model by introducing demand. Let me use a very simple demand model: consumers want equal quantities of both goods. To use microeconomic jargon, this implies that wine and cloth are perfect complements - one is useless without the other, with no possibility of substitution.
  * The model without trade ("autarky"):
    * England: a little arithmetic shows that, with 10 units of labor, we need to have 4 units of labor in wine production and 6 units in cloth production. That provides consumers with 24 casks of wine and 24 bolts of cloth.
    * Portugal: again, simple arithmetic shows that there will be 2 units of labor in wine production and 8 units in cloth production, and Portuguese consumers will have 8 casks of wine and 8 bolts of cloth.

To summarize this in our table:

| Wine | Cloth  
---|---|---  
England | 6 | 4 | pC = 1.5  
_workers | _4 | _6  
_output | _24 | _24  
_consumption | _24 | _24  
======== | _no | _trade |  =======  
Portugal | 4 | 1 | pC = 4  
_workers | _2 | _8  
_output | _8 | _8  
_consumption | _8 | _8  
  
Now let's allow trade to commence - it's 1589 and the Spanish Armada is no
longer stopping commerce. What do English ship captains want to load up with?
- clearly cloth, since it's the cheaper in England, but will fetch lots of
wine in Portugal. (In contrast, Portuguese merchants load their cargoes with
wine.)

So what we find, then, are English and Portuguese traders buying cloth in
Manchester, carrying it Lisbon and selling it for wine, and carting the wine
back to London. They earn very nice profits while it lasts.

But prices adjust. Everyone is buying cloth in England, and selling wine
there. The price of cloth must rise. As a consequence, workers find they can
earn a better living making cloth, where their **comparative** productivity is
higher, and so quit the vineyards for the mills. In Portugal, the opposite
occurs: workers find they earn more money in wine production, and so shift
jobs. Indeed, who's ever heard of English wine? - for all the muttering into
their cups about satanic mills, English workers found the wages there were
higher, the wine cheaper (and better), and voted with their feet. Likewise,
Portuguese textile production disappears.

The new world of production is thus as follows (:

| Wine | Cloth  
---|---|---  
England | 6 | 4 | pC > 1.5  
_workers | _0 | _10  
_output | _0 | _40  
_consumption | _?? | _??  
======== | _trade! | _trade! |  =======  
Portugal | 4 | 1 | pC < 4  
_workers | _10 | _0  
_output | _40 | _0  
_consumption | _?? | _??  
  
But in fact we can use our demand technology to state more. For example, one
possible outcome is that Portugal will export 30 casks of wine and import 10
bolts of cloth. That gives the following outcome:

| Wine | Cloth  
---|---|---  
England | 6 | 4 | must have pC > 1.5  
_workers | _0 | _10  
_output | _0 | _40  
_imports (exports) | _+30   | _-10  
_consumption | _30   | _30  
  Trade: | 30 casks <\-- | \-->10 bolts | pC = 3 with trade  
Portugal | 4 | 1 | must have pC < 4  
_workers | _10 | _0  
_output | _40 | _0  
_imports (exports) | _-30 | _+10  
_consumption | _10 | _10  
  
Here we have our demand condition being satisfied - equal amounts of both
goods in each country - and our price condition being met - the price of cloth
is higher in England and lower in Portugal. Furthermore, incomes are higher in
**both** countries. (Indeed, with these numbers income is 25% higher.) **All**
workers benefit from trade **everywhere**.

In sum, the Law of Comparative Advantage states you should:

  * specialize in that at which you're comparatively best

and

  * trade on that basis

and that by doing so:

  * both parties benefit.

  
Obviously, anything that interferes with trade then hurts everyone. More on
that in class, where we will briefly discuss attempts to foster free trade,
from Article 1 Section 8 of the US Constitution to the GATT & WTO, and NAFTA &
the EU & APEC. But mostly we'll look at tariffs and quotas and VERs and AD
suits and other pieces of alphabet soup.

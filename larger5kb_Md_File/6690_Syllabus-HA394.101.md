### Detailed guide to course requirements:

> PAPER

>   * \--Subject of paper to be approved by Wednesday 31 May

>   * \--Paper due Monday 19 June at the end of class

>   * \--Assignment:

Write a 5-10 page paper in which you can

>   * 1.) discuss and interpret an object or group of objects in the Kelsey
Museum of Archaeology

>   * 2.) discuss and interpret an object or group of objects illustrated in
either of the two textbooks or in the readings

>   * 3.) compare objects illustrated in both textbooks; that is look at the
differences between Egyptian and Graeco-Roman objects.

When writing your paper, you should provide a basic description of the
object(s) you're writing about. Then discuss the object(s) in terms of this
course--how it relates to conceptions of the human body and/or sexuality in
its cultural context.  
>  
>  You do not have to address both body and sexuality in your paper; in some
cases both won't be relevant or you will just want to concentrate on one
aspect.  
>  
>  For those of you working on objects in the Kelsey Museum (either on display
or in storage), Robin Meador-Woodruff (the Kelsey Museum registrar) is the
person to contact for information and/or access to objects. She is accessible
via phone (747-0442) or email (rmw@umich.edu). Anyone wishing to work on
Kelsey Museum objects should arrange to do so well in advance.  
>  
>  For those students who are interested and already have the requisite
technical knowledge, I am willing to accept papers in electonic format,
especially in the form of an interactive document accessible via World Wide
Web. If you are interested in this option, it is essential that you get this
approved ahead of time. I will need a printed outline of your online document,
as well as an operational URL for your online paper by the due date. Thus, the
paper must be finished and online by 12:30 pm, 19 June.  
>  FINAL EXAM:

>   * The final will be in two parts: slide identifications and essays.

>   * On Wednesday 14 June, I will distribute a study guide for the exam. This
will include a list of slides from which the exam slides will be chosen and a
list of questions from which the exam questions will be chosen.

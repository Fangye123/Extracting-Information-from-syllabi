HIST 315C - 20th Century American Foreign Policy  
Fall 2002

AM 224  
TR 1:40-2:55

**Instructor: Dr. Jon Stauff, Associate Professor of History**  
**Office: 230 Ambrose Hall, 563-333-6389, StauffJonW@ambrose.sau.edu**  
**Hours: MTWRF 10:00-11:00 and by appointment**

HIST 315C is an advanced survey of American diplomatic history over the last
one hundred years.  Given the events of the past year, Americans have learned
how important it is to monitor the activities of governments and people
throughout the world.  We need to learn more about these people and their
institutions in order to appreciate the work of our own government's foreign
policy professionals.  This course builds upon information presented in HIST
111 and HIST 112 and provides students with an opportunity to understand how
officials in the White House, the State Department, and the Pentagon determine
"American Foreign Policy."

HIST 315C will be delivered in a seminar format, and the instructor will
deliver the course with a variety of active learning strategies, including in-
class and electronic discussion, short class presentations, and a final course
project with collaborative and individual components.  We will be using the
Blackboard course management software package to support these active learning
strategies, so students will need to have an e-mail address and access to the
Internet (supplied either at home or on campus - consult the Information
Technology Office in Ambrose 300 to obtain an e-mail account and more
information about the campus computer network).  Students will need to access
Blackboard to complete course assignments - supplementary materials will be
placed on Blackboard to make your regular visits there a worthwhile activity.

Hopefully, HIST 315C will be a demanding yet rewarding experience.  There will
be a good amount of reading involved, but the quality of the materials should
make the reading interesting as well as informative.

**Required Course Textbooks (available at the SAU bookstore and online
at[http://www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/)):**

Merrill/Paterson, _Major Problems in American Foreign Policy - Volume II_ ,
Fifth Edition  
Knock, _To End All Wars_  
Glendon, _A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights_  
LaFeber, _Inevitable Revolutions: The United States in Central America_

Students should buy the Merrill/Paterson (M/P) and Knock books immediately and
begin reading them in the first week of the semester.  We will use M/P
everyday, so students should always prepare the assigned readings and bring
that book to class.  Dates of the discussion of the three monographs (Knock,
Glendon, and LaFeber) have been noted on the course schedule below.

**Evaluations:**  
  **Three book reviews (5 pp. each on Knock, Glendon, and LaFeber, 10% each)**
| **30%**  
---|---  
**One midterm exam** | **20%**  
**Weekly online discussion (using Blackboard)** | **10%**  
**Weekly document analysis (500 words each)** | **15%**  
**Final project (Outline of group presentation, group bibliography, individual
5-7pp paper, individual bibliography** | **25%**  
  
**Book reviews** \- students will read the three monographs and prepare 5 pp.
book reviews on each.   For help on preparing book reviews for history, check
out this great web site designed especially for students with these
assignments: <http://www.libraries.uc.edu/libinfo/research/bookrev.html>.

**Midterm exam** \- traditional format of essay questions. ****

**Weekly participation in Blackboard discussion forums** \- I will expect you
to participate in the discussion forums set up on our Blackboard course
management website.  At least three entries a week - asking questions,
providing commentary, answering questions, and generally interacting with your
course partners...quality participation, of course, and not "oh yeah, I agree"
and sending a message with no new content.

**Weekly document analysis** \- every Thursday you will turn in a 500-word
analysis of a primary source from the assigned readings.   We will spread the
primary sources around and ask that you prepare to introduce the document to
your colleagues in class.  Essentially, you will be asked to provide
background information about the document (who wrote it...where did it come
from...when was it written...what is the significance of the document).

**Final project** \- this is a sketch of what I will expect, but we will have
time during the semester to work out the details together.  I would like you
to work with a partner/partners and create a twenty-minute presentation for a
public audience about a particular world "hot spot" where the US is involved.
A list will be provided on the first day of class, and we will form groups of
two or three in the first week of the semester.  Each group will collect
newspaper and magazine articles on their assigned area (using online resources
on library databases), create a working bibliography of source materials in
print and online, and prepare a twenty-minute presentation that explains how
the United States has developed a policy to deal with this particular hot
spot.  Each individual within the group will prepare his/her own paper (5-7
pp.), based upon their research over the course of the semester.  This project
will take the place of a final examination. ****

**Class attendance is mandatory**.   Students with a time conflict should
approach the instructor at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss
his/her absence. ****

**Students with disabilities should approach me at the beginning of the
semester to discuss accommodations.   **We will be able to work with Ann
Austin and Ryan Saddler in the Office for Students with Disabilities and
design exactly what is needed to provide each and every student with an
opportunity to succeed in HIST 315C.

Each student should strive to do his or her own work.  **Cheating, plagiarism,
and other instances of academic dishonesty will be prosecuted to the fullest
extent of the law, i.e. the Dean of Students will be brought into the
discussion.**

Best wishes for an enriching intellectual experience here in HIST 315C.

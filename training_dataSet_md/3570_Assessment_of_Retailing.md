Assessment Results

**

**

  1. Educational Quality and Completeness
**

All students in the College of Hospitality, Retailing and Sport Management are
required to complete a set of course requirements in English, History, Foreign
Language, Science, Mathematics, Humanities and Social Sciences prior to
graduation. To insure quality of instruction in the Major, all core retailing
courses are taught by permanent Retailing faculty.

**

  2. Course Progression and Grade Requirements
**

All undergraduate students are required to meet the minimum progression of the
Department. Overall grade point requirements and grade point deficit actions
are monitored and acted upon by the College of Hospitality, Retailing and
Sport Management.

**

  3. Student Satisfaction
**

  1. Student Course Evaluations   
  
The average course evaluation for the college is consistently above 4.0 on a
5.0 scale for the past five years. These results are consistent with the high
quality of our teaching faculty, and with our commitment to providing the best
undergraduate retailing program available in the Southeast.  
  

  2. Academic Advisement/Mentorship   
  

All faculty are required to post office hours on their course syllabus or
beside their office doors and to be available in their office a minimum of one
hour for each hour of class taught. Furthermore, all undergraduates are
assigned to a faculty advisor when entering the department. Although students
are free to change advisors; under normal circumstances one faculty member
will be the student's mentor and advisor for his/her entire undergraduate
career. All faculty are involved in this advisement process and no
professional or student advisors are used. Students must meet with their
advisor a minimum of once per semester. Failure to do so results in the
inability of the student to register for the following semester's classes.

**Course Description**  
An overview of the expectations, resources, and opportunities for graduate
study in French, this course introduces beginning students to the research
practices associated with coursework in the American university system and
develops pre-professional competencies. A broad introduction to French
studies, this course aims to prepare a diverse group of graduate students from
a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences for the many demands of
coursework and the need to develop and integrated set of skills for research,
writing, and professional collegiality. Among other topics, we will explore
discipline-specific library skills and resources, library and archival
research, grants and fellowships, electronic resources, and publication. In
addition, the course will touch upon the history of French studies in the
United States and in France in order to provide students with a general
understanding of the waxing and waning of various paradigms for literary study
and theory during the past century. The format of the course will allow for a
flexible mixture of lextures/presentations by myself and other faculty members
and graduate students, visits to the library to meet with information
specialists, and class discussions and workshops. Requirements will include
short writing and research assignments and presentations. Emphasis will be
placed on class participation and input. Reading assignments will be minimal.

We use the =/- system when assigning grades. We use GradeBook to calculate
your grades. Npte that your grade on GradeBook does NOT reflect deductions for
missed days. You have access to your grade at all times via Campus GradeBook
Student WebAccess. Click here: <https://gradebook.cso.uiuc.edu/SWA>

Participation: **** German 104 is not a conference course. Daily attendance in
class is necessary and expected. You are allowed 4 absences, beginning with
the 5th absence, your course average will drop dramatically. (1% off of your
final grade per missed day. Criteria for evaluating oral performance:

Grade | Criteria  
---|---  
A | Student uses German; is eager to volunteer and is attentive; negotiates
meaning with other students; elaborates spontaneously, gives more that asked
for; uses circumlocution to compensate for unknown vocabulary, always well-
prepared.  
B | Student uses German as the language of communication; is attentive and
responsive; volunteers and gives more than required though not always
successful; has usually prepared the day's lesson.  
C | Adequate participation, but waits to be called upon; responses often
incorrect; often resorts to English  
D | Student is usually unprepared; little effort to participate; responses
usually incorrect.  
F | Insignificant  
  
Homework: You will be responsible for all the assignments listed on the
syllabus for any given day. Very often, your homework is done electronically,
i.e. on Mallard. You will receive instructions on how to use this system.
Homework assignments must be completed for the date listed on the syllabus. No
late homework will be accepted. If you anticipate being absent at some future
date, make arrangements with your instructor beforehand. Check with a
classmate or with your instructor for changes in assignments.

Short Quizzes: During the course of the term, you will take short quizzes
(5-10 minutes each) that will be announced in class. Such quizzes can cover
materials practiced in class, in the language lab or in homeworks.

Group Projects: You and your group will choose a topic related to the topic of
the week, research the topic on the web, and present your findings in an easy
to understand and fun way to the rest of the class. There will be three
different group projects - and you will be given plenty of guidance on what is
expected of you.

Essays: You will write 4 essays in the course of this term. Essays are due on
the date indicated on the syllabus. No late work will be excepted. All essays
must be typed (1 inch margins, double-spaced, in a Times 12 font). Topics and
writing aids will be posted on the website.

Written exams: There will be 4 one-hour exams. The exam will start and end for
all students at the same time. If you show up late for an exam, you have lost
time. The exams are similar in content and format to assignments you have done
at home and in class. If you miss an exam without obtaining permission from
your instructor prior to the exam, you will receive a 0 for this exam. Family
emergencies that can be substantiated to the satisfaction of the instructor
will be treated as exceptions.

Final Exam: Your final exam is scheduled for ________________________.
Students who can substantiate that they have 3 exams on this day, or those who
can prove that they have an exam scheduled at the same time are allowed to
take the exam at an alternate time if they inform their instructor in advance.
(N.B.: Plan your winter vacation accordingly. Having a departure date that
conflicts with your German final exam date will not constitute a valid excuse
for rescheduling your final). The final will start and end at the same time
for all students. If you show up late for the final, you have lost time. If
you fail to show up for the final exam at the appointed time without having
obtained permission from your instructor in advance of the test, you will
receive a grade of F (specifically, a zero) for the final.

Extra credit: Come and join the Stammtisch-crowd or the German Club for extra
credit. Dates, places and times will be announced in class or on the 103
website. Swing by for a very informal chance to chat with native and non-
native speakers of German, to drink coke or beer and to eat pizza. If you
cannot attend, ask your teacher for other extra-credit activities.

**Academic Dishonesty:** All work for this class should reflect YOUR work.
Unless otherwise noted, the only "outside help" that is allowed is from your
instructor, dictionaries, spell checker, and grammar books. Help from tutors,
other instructors, or other speakers of German for graded assignments will be
treated as cheating.

  * identify services to students provided by each of the major student personnel programs/services on two-year and four-year college campuses.
    * a. list the administrators typically responsible for the coordination of such services.
    * b. indicate which sub-populations of students will most likely benefit from such services.
    * c. describe the relationships between the faculty, administration, and student body which
  
    are enhanced by the services. 
  * acquire knowledge bases that serve as the foundation for the profession:
    * a. knowledge of self.
    * b. knowledge of the college student population and its diversity.
    * c. knowledge of college environmental settings and their influences.
    * d. knowledge of student personnel

use current professional literature and resources in order to keep informed of
current events, research issues, and reviews and problems in student affairs.

**_Course Expectations_**

People working in the field of student development education are "in class on
duty" 24 hours a day, so we all need to _develop the right balance between
challenge and support_. You will face great challenge in new assistantships,
moving to a new locale, and starting a new field of study. The structure
provided in this explicit syllabus is intended to provide ample support to
make details clear and predictable and eliminate most ambiguity as you begin
your program. You can plan your time better with this detail. Furthermore,
each of you will have _different preferences in learning styles:_ this class
is designed to provide reading, talking, listening, reflecting, individual and
group work, experiential education activities, and individual attention as
well as large class activity. _Let your instructor know how any activity might
be modified or designed to be of greatest benefit to you_. At the same time,
stretch yourself to learn in different modes as instruction is presented via
selected elements of the social systems, information-processing, and personal
systems models of instruction.

Figure 1: Conceptual Framework:

Advanced Level (Adopted)

         In accordance with the Primary Learning Model: Ecological (Joyce, et. al., 1992), the specialized educational roles of Curriculum Specialist, master teacher, counselor [student development educator], and administrator are defined and driven by 81 specific objectives for advanced programs. The objectives build upon the Knowledge and Outcomes for the Basic Programs. 

###  **_Specific Learning Activities_**

* **1.** Read assigned materials (textbooks, reserve items, videos, e-mail, WWW) **prior** to class discussion. Your responsibility to other students is to be prepared and able to engage in large group discussion and small group interaction activities. The required texts will be a good beginning to your professional library. Not all readings will be addressed in class, but they will be a good basis for context setting, comprehensive exam review, and professionalizaton. From time to time, additional readings will be assigned or materials will handed out in class. _It is your responsibility to have someone obtain copies for you if you are unavoidably absent. Otherwise, you will have to copy the handouts from another student, or, in some cases, from e-mail or the Internet, if you wish to have them for your reference._ _Copies are expensive, and I will offer them only once._
* **2.** Participate in the in-class discussions. Since our class meets once weekly, attendance is essential. Active interaction and participation are important; however, participation does not mean merely verbal interaction. Your preparation, attentiveness and willingness to share and disclose in smaller groups is essential. Absences will reflect in participation in the final grade computation. Please leave me a message (answering machine at home [345-1465], or e-mail) if you must miss class or we will be concerned about you. From time to time, additional readings will be assigned or materials will be handed out in class. _As stated above, it is your responsibility to have someone obtain copies for you if you are absent, else you must copy their handouts._ Bring handouts you find valuable to share if desired (enough for each student plus one for the instructor). Announcements about campus events of interest in which you are involved are always welcome.
* **3.** Join in visitation to area institutions of higher education, specifically, the **[MMOGSISP MEETING](mailto:mmogsisp@iastate.edu) (e-mail) ** at Iowa State University,  Ames, Iowa, November 15-17, 1998, and/or the David Dodds Henry Lecture at the University of Illinois, to be announced on the Introcsp Listserv, and COSPA-L. (Other CSP professional association meetings may be substituted.)

###  **_Course Format_**

EDG 5760 will include the expertise of on-campus and off-campus professionals
in college student personnel administration. Students will prepare for these
in-class presentations by reading relevant chapters in the course textbooks,
the World Wide Web, and in assigned readings and videos in the Booth Library
Reading Room. A question-and-answer session will be included in each class
meeting involving the presenter and students. The remaining class time in each
session will be used to supplement and complement the weekly topic.

**_Ethical Standards_**  
As a graduate student, we expect the highest personal and professional
standards which reflect the objectives of EIU EDG and our [CSP professional
ethics](http://www.acpa.nche.edu/pubs/prncstan.htm). Should you need
assistance with any foundation skills (e.g., mathematics, writing, public
speaking), I will assist you to find the help you need. Should any student
violate standards of academic dishonesty (in written work, research, etc.),
they will be held accountable through EIU Graduate School procedures. Clearly,
we must practice and model for others the highest possible academic standards.

Note: Booth Library carries [83 professional
journals](http://www.eiu.edu/~eiucsp/Journals.htm) which disseminate articles
on student personnel services in higher education. EIU is well supplied with
information in our field at this campus.

**_Internet_**  
The Internet, both e-mail and the World Wide Web, are rich sources of current
imformation about the field of student affairs. There are more than 100
Listservs dedicated to issues in student affairs on the Internet. We will be
learning to use this system of information dissemination together. A local
e-mail Listserv, **[introcsp](mailto:majordomo@eiu.edu)** , dedicated
specifically to students in this class has been created. All students are
expected to obtain a personal e-mail account with the University Computing
Center in the basement of the Student Services Building, and to use the Class
Listserv as a means of enhancing communication among students and the
instructor.   Only students registered in this class will have access to
**introcsp.**

To use **introcsp,** subscribe to the list by:

* (1) addressing an e-mail to: majordomo@eiu.edu
* (2) typing your e-mail address into the title/subject line
* (3) entering the following _two_ lines in the body of the message:
* subscribe introcsp@eiu.edu
* end
* (4) sending the e-mail. I will do the rest to approve your subscription.
* (5) as a first exercise after you obtain your personal student e-mail account, submit up to a 100 word
  
      introduction of yourself to the instructor and the listserv by September 8, 1998..

* * *

**_Course Requirements_**

**Term Project:** _(25 % of final grade): Each student will complete a term
project designed to allow the student to do
some[library](http://www.eiu.edu/~booth/) research and creative thinking on a
topic of his/her choice._  


**Option A:** Complete a _20 page paper_ on a topic of your choice which
includes at least _30 pertinent references_ in the bibliography, **and** which
are cited in the body of the paper in [APA
Style](http://www.uvm.edu/~ncrane/estyles). The completed paper will be due
**November 19, 1998**.   Students wishing to write a Master's Thesis may use
the EDG 5760 paper as an opportunity to hone library research and writing
skills and/or to complete the Review of Literature for their study topic {Such
students should plan to enroll in the Research in Counseling and Student
Personnel course ([EDG 5940](http://www.eiu.edu/~eiucsp/5940.htm)) taught by
Dr. Powell in Fall, 1997, or that I teach in Spring, 1998}. Students searching
for ideas are encouraged to visit with me. Topics currently of interest to me
include orientation of new faculty and staff to a campus, use of technology in
student affairs, student organization development (esp. the American College
Fraternity), mentoring,  undergraduate experiences of current teaching
faculty,  men's issues, and assessment of learning in higher education.

**Option B:** Other avenues for presentation of ideas and knowledge acquired
may be substituted for the paper. I am especially interested in students who
may wish to make an instructional video, Internet learning exercises or
development of a Home Page for the CSP program, interactive computer programs,
or use of other electronic media as a term project. Documentation accompanying
the medium is to include the 30 references to the literature of student
affairs. The deadline for completion of the project is negotiable with the
student depending upon the complexity of the activity.    Power point
presentations which students may propose for professional conferences such as
MMOGSISP or [ACPA](http://www.acpa.nche.edu/conv99/acpa99.htm) are especially
encouraged.

**Mid-Term and Final Examination:** (25% _each of final grade)--_ A mid-term
_take home exam_ will be distributed on **October 12, 1998** , and a final
exam will be distributed at the last class period, to be due at the regular
final exam period. Both will be essay in nature. Class members will be
expected to respond in an informed manner on topics covered in class and in
outside required and recommended readings. Exam content is typically related
to a national higher education current event or a controversy on campus (exam
specifics will be individually tailored to fit the special situations of
students from campuses other than EIU). Each exam will be counted as 25 per
cent of the course grade.

**Additional Assignments:** _(10 % of final grade)_ \--Additional position
papers, readings, or other short subjects may be assigned throughout the
semester. Students are expected to hand in all assigned written materials on
time, and they will be evaluated on the basis of whether items are completed
on time. These assignments will constitute ten percent of the course grade.
Examples from which you may select include, but are **not** limited to, the
items below. A _minimum of four events_ in this category should be completed
for a course grade of "A". Extra credit well be awarded for additional
reports.  


**a.** Attend a meeting of a student organization **__never__** attended
during your undergraduate years, observe the students, their interaction with
each other, and their commitment to the activity. Write a short 2-4 page
report giving your descriptive impressions and your critical analysis of the
meetings. Remember to include mention of the relative levels of student
development you observe among the participating students.

**b**. Assist an instructor of EIU 1004, _Freshman Seminar_ , with preparation
for a segment of their course materials, attend the class, and prepare a short
critical analysis of your experience. Mention your assessment of the level of
student development among the students in the class. In order to facilitate
your contact with EIU 1004 instructors, a list indicating faculty and class
periods is appended to this syllabus. Students who elect this option **must
have** their activity **completed** by **October 19, 1998** , just after the
last day of the EIU 1004 course.

**c.** Attend a student personnel professional meeting such as the Midwest
Meeting of Graduate Students in Student Personnel (MMOGSISP), or the David
Dodds Henry Lecture at the University of Illinois, observe the event, and
prepare a short report of your impressions as to the personal value of such
meetings to student affairs professionals in higher education.

**d.** Make a professional presentation at a meeting of student affairs
professionals such as MMOGSISP, and report your critical analysis of the
experience.

**e.** Attend a Campus Lecture Series or Departmental Seminar, describe the
event, and prepare a short report on who attended, their attentiveness to the
program, their general level of student development, and your impressions of
the event itself.

**f.** Spend an hour or two at a campus "hangout" frequented by undergraduate
students. Describe the event, your impressions, and your critical analysis.
Examples of campus "hangouts" include the local bars, and alternatives such as
the Lighthouse (Thursdays and Fridays at the Wesley Foundation), Lantz Gym,
and Martin Luthur King, Jr., Union.

**g.** Attend an event in which you are the racial, affectional, or sexual
minority.

**h.** Attend one of the Campus Administrative Search Committee meetings
and/or receptions which will be announced from time to time, such as the
Presidential Search Committee.

**i.** Attend a meeting of [Faculty Senate](http://www.eiu.edu/minutes.html)
(Tuesday afternoons, 2:00 - 4:00 p.m., Booth Library), [Council on Academic
Affairs](http://www.eiu.edu/minutes.html) (Thursday afternoons, 2:00 - 4:00
p.m., 3rd Floor, Union), or [Graduate Studies Council
](http://www.eiu.edu/minutes.html)(Tuesday afternoons). Compare the behavior
of these faculty and their apparent level of psychosocial development to the
students you observed in a student organization meeting.

**j.   **Select two university web pages belonging to institutions you did NOT
attend as an undergraduate.  Go to the student affairs section(s) and review
their content.  Write a 2-3 page account describing your impressions of the
web pages, and attach examples.  What is present and useful, and what is
absent that would improve their presentation and informational value?  Make
certain to include illustrations of what you discuss from the web pages so I
have a reference point.

**Article Abstracts:** _(10 % of the final course grade)_ \-- Beginning with
the **September 21, 1998** , class session, students will be expected to
abstract one article from the professional literature on the announced
discussion topic each week. A sample abstract and model format for the
abstracts will be described in class. A good source for articles are the
professional journals listed in the Booth Library holdings handout.  Students
should submit their [article
abstract](http://www.eiu.edu/~eiucsp/articleabst.htm) to the **introcsp**
listserv so everyone in class can have the benefit of your scholarship.
_Articles citing The_ _Chronicle of Higher Education as the source will   be
accepted for this exercise **once only**. The Chronicle is a newspaper written
by journalists, **not** a professional contribution of student affairs
practitioners._

**Student Development Theory** : Beginning October 7, 1998, and continuing
during two more class sessions, use your article reading time to prepare
**one** _six to eight page paper_ on student developmental theories and your
perception of their application to your own personal growth/development as an
undergraduate college student. Suggested theorists for research include but
are not limited to: L. Kohlberg, J.Rest, A, Chickering, C. Gilligan, W. Perry,
and V. Cass. Alternative selections are subject to instructor approval. This
paper is due ( _in APA Style_ ) on **October 28, 1998**. It will count as
three weekly abstracts, and must contain a minimum of five references
(articles or books or internet sites [which I will check]) cited in the body
of the paper.

Papers are to be biographical in scope, and should be designed to illustrate
the essence of the theory with specific examples from your own life explained
in detail {Visual people are encouraged to develop a photographic collage or
power point presentation of scenes from their college experience which protray
their development.}  For example, how, where, and why do Kohlberg's theories
apply to your college experience from the freshman to the senior year?  How
have your undergraduate experiences led you to graduate study in the field of
student affairs?   What would be a possible research project arising from the
application of the theory you selected based on your own undergraduate
experience?

**Class Participation** : ( _5% of the course grade_ )--Your contributions in
class as described above are imporant to your growth and that of other
students and the instructor.  The quality of your class participation will
constitute 5 percent of the course grade.

**_Writing Support Groups_**  
An administrator with poor writing skills is handicapped from the very
beginning. Students are encouraged to support each other in the development of
their writing skills, organize into writing support groups, and share drafts
of class papers with group members for comments and suggestions for revision
prior to submitting the completed paper to the instructor for marking
purposes. The quality of writing, and the scholarly effort placed in class
papers will be a factor in determining grade distinctions. This is part of
putting theory to practice. Read:

Ostrowski, P. A., & Bartel, S. (1985). Assisting practitioners to publish
through the use of support groups. **Journal of Counseling and Development,
63** (8), 510-511.

**Writing Style** : Clear, concise writing is central to success in the
student affairs profession. Most student affairs journals use the American
Psychological Association style as the guide for publications. **All papers
for courses in the Department of Educational Psychology and Guidance MUST be
written in[APA Style](http://www.uvm.edu/~ncrane/estyles/apa.html).** _Papers
submitted which are not in APA Style will be returned unmarked for re-
formatting.   _Purchase a copy of the **Publications Manual of the American
Psychological Association, Fourth edition** , at the MLK, Jr., Union
Bookstore. You will find it helpful to your work on many different occasions.

**Technological Literacy:** If you do not currently know how to type, learn.
Computer keyboarding assistance is available at the Student Services Computer
Center, and at the English Writing Center in Coleman Hall. All written
assignments are to be typed and must use APA Style. _Preferably, your
assignment should be done on a word processor or with wordprocessing software
(Wordperfect 5.1, 6.0, 6.1, 7.0 or 8.0). You must learn to be computer
literate!_ Use the facilities in Booth Library, the Computer Center, or
anywhere else. When you use a word processor, _remember to "back-up" your
document regularly_. "The computer lost my document" is NOT a good excuse
these days.

**E-Mail:** All students must acquire a campus e-mail address at the Computer
Center (there is no charge). Two Listservs are available for majors in college
student personnel as a means of communication among students and this
instructor. When you have your e-mail account and address, send a message to:
**[Majordomo@eiu.edu](mailto:majordomo@eiu.edu)** First, the Listserv
dedicated specifically to this class is
**[introcsp@eiu.edu](mailto:introcsp@eiu.edu)** , and second, the Listserv for
all CSP-emphasis students and program graduates is
**[cospa-l@eiu.edu](mailto:cospa-l@eiu.edu)**.

* * *

Send a message to: majordomo@eiu.edu

Type anything/something on the title/subject line

In the body of the message, type the following three lines:

subscribe cospa-l@eiu.edu

subscribe introcsp@eiu.edu

end

Then, send the message.

* * *

  


**_Determination of Course Grade_**  
Individual term projects, mid-term and final examinations will be marked on a
scale ranging from 30 to 80, with 50 denoting "average" performance (based on
years of experience responding to student papers, not just on the performance
of students in this particular class). Article abstracts and additional
assignments will be marked on a scale from "one" to "three", with a "three"
representing the best quality work, a "two" representing hastily done work,
late work, or missing elements in the work, and a "one" representing very late
work or very incomplete work. All categories will be summed across elements,
and the resulting totals used to generate weighted standard scores (T-scores)
on an Excel spread sheet for each category using the following weighting
system (default weights):  


**Mid-term exam                   25%**  
**Final exam                          25%**  
**Term project                       25%**  
**Article Abstracts                10%**  
**Additional Assignments     10%**  
**Class Participation               5%**

Final weighted standard scores of 55 and above will receive an "A", those from
45 to 54.99 a "B", those 35 to 44.99 a mark of "C", and those 34.99 or less a
mark of "D". It will be necessary to have complete data for each person in the
course in order to compute final grades. You can be reasonably confident of
your mark if you receive scores of 50 or above on papers, and three's on all
other work. In my past experience with this system of marking, the difference
between an "A" (Acceptable graduate performance) and a "B" (You'd best do
better) is whether Article Abstracts and Additional Assignments are submitted
**on time**.

**Adjustment to individual learning styles:** Since students learn
differently, I am open to changing the "weighting" on the course marking
scheme to fit student perceptions of their individual strengths. That is, if
library research and writing is your strong suit, but essay exams are a
challenge for you, you may wish to change the mid-term and final to 10 percent
of your mark, and the term project to constitute 40 percent of your mark.
Please tell me by mid-term what weighting you would prefer in the computation
of your final mark.

**_Return of Papers_**  
Due to the **writing intensive** nature of this course, the large number of
students, and my own desire to give each person's work the individual
attention it justly deserves, the prompt return of papers may be a challenge
on occasion. Nevertheless, I shall do my best to mark and return papers as
soon as possible. In order to pay my best attention to those students who
submit their work on time, **late papers will NOT be counted for purposes of
determining course grades. However, all papers must be submitted in order to
receive a grade for the course. Students with "Incompletes" at the end of the
semester can never expect to receive a mark higher than a "B", and will
typically receive a "C".**

**A note on extension:** Reasonable extensions will always be granted! I am
happy to help you within reason by relieving any pressures I can. Any
assignment due during a class session can usually be exended to that Friday.
Please request an extension BEFORE the due date if possible (call me, e-mail
me, or come by the office prior to class) and propose when you will turn in
the assignment. Learn to handle some parts of your assignment early, etc.
**Extensions will NOT generally be granted for mid-terms or finals** unless
you have illness or death-type problems. I may not be able to return late
assignments with other on-time papers.

As the person who will likely write a job recommendation for you, I am most
concerned about patterns of doing untimely work (do you often find yourself
running late?), not occasional requests. Patterns may indicate behaviors that
will cause professional work problems and dilemmas. Let's talk soon if you
find patterns developing and need help with ways to get your classrwork done
in the face of so many competing pressures. _Patterns will be reflected in
loss of participation points on final grade in fairness to other
professionals-in-training who have done timely work, often at great personal
secrifice to get it done within the required deadline._

**_Class Session Outline (Tentative)_**

( **Subject to change due to speaker avalability** )

This class outline gives you topics that will be addressed in this course.
Some topics may start sooner or later than indicated, so if you miss a class,
be certain to ask others where we are in the outline. Please at least skim
materials you may not have time to read and _bring readings with you to class
for referral and small group discussion._

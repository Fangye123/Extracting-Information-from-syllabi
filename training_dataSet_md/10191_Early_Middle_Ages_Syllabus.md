![](theodora.jpg)

This course examines the history of the early middle ages, chronologically
from about A.D. 300 to 900\. Major themes and topics will include: the later
Roman empire, the establishment of the barbarian kingdoms, the growth of the
Christian church, and the emergence of the Carolingian empire. While a
considerable amount of lecture time will be devoted to political history, the
course focuses primarily on the social, economic and cultural aspects of early
medieval life.

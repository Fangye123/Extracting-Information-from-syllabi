| **Course Description**  
This course surveys the history of "western civilization" from the seventeenth
century to the present. Through assigned readings, discussions, videos, in-
class "workshops," and other activities we will learn about and gain a better
understanding of the people, places, trends, and events that have shaped
"western civilization" over the past four hundred years. We will pay
particular attention to the interplay between events, such as the
Enlightenment or the French Revolution, and ideas, such as rationalism and
nationalism, over time. This course will enhance your studies in many other
disciplines, including art history, economics, literature, philosophy,
political science, sociology, and theology. This course satisfies the
Dominican University's history core area requirement.  
  
**Course Objectives**  
By the end of the course, you should be able to:  
\- describe the and explain the significance of the major ideas, institutions,
events, and trends that have shaped "western civilization" since the
seventeenth century;  
\- analyze and interpret primary source materials more thoughtfully and
critically;  
\- postulate your own questions about the past;  
\- write an historical argument that analyzes and interprets the most
significant changes in "western civilization" since 1600; and  
\- use primary and secondary evidence to support your historical descriptions,
interpretations, and arguments.  
  
|  
| **Course Requirements**  
_Assignments:_ Graded assignments and their percentage of the final grade are:  
\- 40% (120 points) for twelve journal entries  
\- 20% (60 points) for mid-term examination  
\- 40% (120 points) for final examination  
Uncompleted assignments will be scored as a "zero" and averaged with the
completed assignments to produce a final grade.  
  
_Journal entries:_ You will be expected to complete a series of  "journal
entries" in this course. In them, you will record your thoughts and reactions
to various historical documents and artifacts. This gives you the opportunity
to analyze and interpret the historical record, to make sense of the past,
just as historians do. For readings outside class, you should complete each
journal entry before class, bring them with you to class, and use them to help
you partake in class discussions. Some journal entries can only be completed
during class. Each journal entry is worth ten points. Eight points will be
given to each journal entry that is turned in on time and offers a sufficient
response to the assigned material. Particularly good entries will receive one
or two additional points depending upon level of insight, quality of writing,
and effectiveness in generating additional class discussion. Extra points are
not easy to get. Substandard or late journal entries will lose points. [More
detailed guidelines](http://homepages.luc.edu/~snewma1/courses/102jour.htm)
for writing the journal entries will be provided during the second week of
class.  
  
_Examinations:_ There will be two exams in this course. Together, they count
as sixty percent of your final grade. There will be a mixture of essay and
short answer questions on both exams. Some parts of the final exam will
require you to synthesize material from both before and after the mid-semester
exam. Guidance to help you prepare for both exams will be provided. Except in
cases of emergency, requests for make-up exams should be made no less than one
week before the day of the exam. Make-ups will be granted only in instances of
illness or scheduling conflicts deemed unavoidable by the instructor.  
  
_Participation:_ Timely completion of all assigned readings, regular class
attendance, and active classroom participation are essential to your success
in this course. It is your responsibility to allocate enough time to complete
the assigned readings before each class. You should come to class prepared to
share your understanding of the readings, relate the readings to other aspects
of the course, and to pose your own questions about the readings. Use the
attached  "Guide to Critical Reading" to help you prepare to discuss assigned
readings.  
  
_Internet Access:_ Since many of the readings for this class are located
online, you will also need internet access in order to complete all
assignments for this course. If you do not have internet access, visit the
computer lab and ask them for assistance in obtaining computer access.  
  
|  
| **Required Texts**  
\- Marvin Perry, _Western Civilization: A Brief History, Volume II_ , 3rd
edition.  
\- Voltaire, _Candide_.  
\- Karl Marx, _The Communist Manifesto_.  
\- Aldous Huxley, _Brave New World_.  
\- Primo Levi, _Survival in Auschwitz: The Nazi Assault on Humanity_.  
\- additional online readings (all students must have internet access)  
  
Copies of the course texts are available for purchase in the university
bookstore. Copies of these texts may also be ordered through most of the
leading on-line booksellers, including some that may have used copies
available for sale at substantial savings. Possibilities include (no
endorsements implied): [www.powells.com](http://www.powells.com),
[www.bibliofind.com](http://www.bibliofind.com),
[www.half.com](http://www.half.com),
[www.textbooks.com](http://www.textbooks.com),
[www.follett.com](http://www.follett.com). Or compare prices at dozens of on-
line booksellers at: [www.campusbooks.com](http://www.campusbooks.com).  
  
**Academic Dishonesty**  
All work submitted for this course must be the product of your own
intellectual efforts. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism (i.e., the
presentation of another's work, dead or alive, published or unpublished, as
your own or without proper citation), is not allowed and will be penalized.
This rule also applies to content copied from web sites. Internet plagiarism
is easy to detect! A grade of zero will be assigned to any paper or exam in
which an instance of academic dishonesty is detected. The zero will then be
averaged with the other grades to determine the final grade for the course.  
  
**Students with Disabilities**  
Students who are disabled or impaired should meet with the professor within
the first two weeks of the semester to discuss the need for any special
arrangements.  |

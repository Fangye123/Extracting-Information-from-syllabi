# The Student Course Review, December 1997 Edition

##  Review of courses offered Spring Semester, 1997

**Welcome**

  
We would like to thank you for using The Student Course Review. The purpose of
the course review is to provide you with comments and feedback from other
students about classes offered at Pomona.

We cannot stress enough the importance that this course review should not be
solely relied upon for course selection. Please use this compilation as a
supplement, not substitute, to asking your advisor and other students about
courses.

The course review is a work in progress; in order to improve it we need
students' feedback. Suggestions about the survey questions are particularly
welcome. Please e-mail any suggestions you have to: [
Senate@pomona.edu](mailto:Senate@pomona.edu) or any editors

Thank you,

Rish Pai and Sujeet Indap  
Co-Editors in Chief

Dan Tzuang  
Committee Chair

Julian Wong  
Academic Affairs Commissioner and Supervisor

Advisor: Neil Gerard

**Important Note:** Comments about courses are from only a portion of students
in classes and thus may not be representative of student opinion as a whole.
Please note carefully the number of reviews received for a specific course.

Some classes are not represented because courses with three or less responses
were not published. We encourage all students to complete their surveys and
remind their professors to distribute the reviews as more responses mean a
more comprehensive review. In addition we did not review classes such as
general chemistry and biology.

Qualitative reviews are assigned according to the following:

***** Extremely Accessible  
**** Above Average  
*** Average (office hours only)  
** Below Average  
* Far Below Average

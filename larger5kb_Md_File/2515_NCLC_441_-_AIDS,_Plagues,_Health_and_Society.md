#### Course Catalog Description:

Designed to give the student an in-depth understanding of the medical and
social matters surrounding selected diseases and their association to disease
prevention and health promotion. Topics include progression of disease,
epidemiology, global emerging infectious diseases, communicable diseases,
economic and financial consequences. Students are provided with current
information and presentations from university faculty and community experts
working in the respective fields.

Course Objectives: Upon completion of this course, the student will be able
to:

  1. Explain how selected diseases affect mankind. 
  2. Identify how viruses and selected bacteria affect its host. 
  3. Discuss the epidemiological impact of disease in society. 
  4. Explore individual assessment of risk and behavior change. 
  5. Discuss issues and trends related to disease prevention and health promotion. 
  6. Analyze current issues and trends related to disease prevention and health promotion. 
  7. Explain how legal and political process affects policies related to disease. 
  8. Identify current strategies in disease prevention and health promotion. 

Course Competencies: The following competencies are emphasized in this
learning community:

  1. _Global Perspectives:_ Demonstrate an understanding of and respect for the economic, social, and biological differences in global life. Aspects include seeing different perspectives and ways of knowing that are based in cultural and geographical difference; understanding connections between local and global issues; understanding the reality of global interconnectedness in areas such as economics and the environment; learning to raise questions about global aspects of a range of issues and knowledge. 
  2. _Critical Thinking:_ Think clearly and critically. Fuse experience, reason, and training into considered judgements. Aspects include differentiating facts from opinions and inferences; recognizing assumptions; identifying language problems such as ambiguity; finding relationships and dividing a complex problem into parts; analyzing and summarizing arguments; synthesizing ideas from multiple sources; finding connections between a range of ideas, facts and experience. 
  3. _Social Interaction:_ Know how to get done in group settings. Elicit the views of others to help reach consensus. Aspects include ability to initiate and sustain group activity; determine goals when working with partner or group; understand and negotiate roles within group; articulate differences and disagreements without conflict; understand how consensus is different from compromise; reflect perceptively on group actions/interactions; assess one's role within a group. 
  4. _Problem Solving:_ Determine what the problem is and what is causing it. With others or alone, form strategies that work in different situations. Act on these strategies, then evaluate effectiveness. Aspects include forming questions to clarify a problem or issue; identifying multiple perspectives and alternative methods; developing a framework or prioritizing order for solutions; collaborating to maximize individual strengths within a group. 

Proficiency in these competencies will be demonstrated through the meeting of
course objectives.

#### Guidelines for Preparation of Presentations

Your presentation should take on the form of a presentation at a national
professional meeting. Presentations should be computer generated or typed. The
computers in the laboratory are available for your use in the preparation of
your presentation. Please be sure to properly cite the literature throughout
your presentation.

#### Common components of an effective presentation are summarized below:

Title and Author: lists the title, author.  
Background: gives the literature background and introduction.  
Purpose: gives the purpose of your topic and highlights your objectives.  
Experimental: gives experimental details if appropriate.  
Results: displays results of your study/investigation.  
Discussion: gives interpretation of your results/findings typically in summary
format.  
Conclusion: gives the overall "take-home" message of your topic.  
Future Plan: gives the plans for the future extension of this topic.  
Acknowledgments: acknowledges the contributions of others to this topic.  
Reference the literature:  
Journal Articles: Author's Last Name, Author's Initials Journal Name, Year,
Volume, Pages. Example: Bradley, P.; Suardi, G.; Zipp, R. J. Am. Chem. Soc.
1994, 116, 2859-2868.  
Books: Authors Last Name, Author's Initials Book Title, Publishers, Year
Published, Pages. Example: Cotton, F. A.; Wilkinson, G. Advanced Inorganic
Chemistry, Wiley & Sons, 1972, 736-738.  

#### 3\. Listserv:

All students must subscribe to the Listserv and participate in the on-line
discussions.  

##### E-mail

You are required to provide an active and valid e-mail address as part of this
course (you are welcome to use any e-mail system you wish as long as it is
accessible through the internet and can receive class related materials) and
use this e-mail address for all electronic communications **(NO EXCEPTIONS)**.

##### Subscribe

You will need to subscribe to the HIV-INFO Listserv at GMU by the end of the
third week of class, failure to do so will cost you one (1) communication
credit.

##### Assignments

You will be graded on your four (4) electronic communications. Two (2)
communications will be in response to information received from other students
and the other two you will initiate related to your topic area (which you will
choose from a list).  
Each communication will include the topic title, a synopsis of the topic
addressed, your opinion, and suggestions or pertinent comments. Each
electronic communication should consist of 200-300 words that has been spell
checked and meet English grammar standards consistent with undergraduate work.  
Communications should be an exchange of views and information that meets the
stated objectives of the course. They should NOT be personal attacks or
statements unsubstantiated by the literature. Provide your source as a
reference.  
Mark all submissions with your name, e-mail address and the type/number of
your submission (i.e. Initiate #1, Response #2).  

##### Listserv Communication Due Dates

The intent of this assignment is to establish a peer dialogue throughout the
semester, therefore, you will need to submit one (1) electronic communication
in February, March, and two (2) in April . The due date is the last day of the
month. Failure to submit timely electronic communications will result in the
loss of 10 points for each late submission after the due date.

#### 4\. Individual Paper:

Typing Requirements:  
Maximum of fifteen (15) pages.  
Double spaced.  
One inch margins on all four sides.  
10 or 12 CPI font.  
Paginate all pages. This means put the page number on all pages except the
cover page.  
  
Conciseness is valued over length.  
  
Title Page: (See cover of syllabus)  
Abstract: An abstract should be included that gives a synopsis of the topic
addressed, its current impact, appropriate reference to its implications in
society and the conclusions reached in your paper.  
Introduction: Introduce your topic to the reader, assume noting.  
Background: States the relevant impact this issue/topic has had in society.  
Review of the Literature: Reviews at least five (5) articles clearly and
concisely.

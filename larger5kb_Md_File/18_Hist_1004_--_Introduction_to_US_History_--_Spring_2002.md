**Course Description**  
This course provides an interpretive overview of the history of the United
States from the eve of European arrival on the North American continent
through the present day. We will frame our discussion of the social, economic,
political, and cultural developments that shaped this nation around three
interlocking themes: 1) the ongoing tension between national unity and
national division due to geography, ideology, and racial, class and ethnic
identity; 2) the changing role of the U.S. in the world, and the efforts to
define what that role should be; and 3) the debate over the function and size
of government, along with related contests over the meaning of "freedom" and
citizenship rights. Our ultimate objective is to understand not only what
happened but why, and to gain some perspective into the arguments and issues
whose history shapes our present lives.

Your work in History 1004 simultaneously satisfies the Virginia Tech
requirement for achieving competency in American history and counts toward the
completion of the University's Area 3 Core Requirement in Society and Human
Behavior.

**Computer Requirements**  
This class requires access to an up-to-date computer and the web - both for
e-mail communication and for use of the course web-page.

_Course Webpage  
_ You can access the course website through the Blackboard 5 portal at:
<http://www.learn.vt.edu>**_._** Logging-in with your Virginia Tech PID and
password will give you direct access to the class web-page, "Hist 1004 - Intro
to US History."

Numerous reading assignments, announcements, weekly quizzes, and posted grades
will **only** be available through the website. I will also post lecture
outlines and lists of key terms at the end of each week.

Finally, additional study aids are available on the companion website to The
Essential America. Simply point your browser to
<http://www.wwnorton.com/eamerica> and click on "Online Tutor" (for practice
quizzes and other exercises) or "e-Reserves" (for links to web-pages of
interest).

Communication  
If you wish to communicate with me via e-mail, please be sure to type "Hist
1004" in the subject header line. Otherwise, I will delete the message without
reading it.

I will communicate with you periodically via e-mail as well. If you check your
e-mail through an account other than your Virginia Tech account (ie: Hotmail
or Yahoo), make sure you configure your Virginia Tech e-mail account to
forward your mail. Otherwise you will miss out on important announcements.

Finally, some things are best discussed in person rather than electronically.
If you have a complicated or sensitive problem to discuss, please feel free to
come and introduce yourself to me. I am always available during my office
hours as well as after class.

**Course Requirements**  
Readings  
Unless otherwise noted on the syllabus, the readings will be due on the
Tuesday of the week they are assigned.

Online Quizzes  
Over the course of the semester, there will be 10 timed online quizzes, of
which you must complete 8. The quizzes will consist of multiple choice
questions based on the readings for that week, and can be accessed via the
"Assignments" link on the class web page (URL listed at top of syllabus).

There will also be a practice quiz the first week of class that is required
but which will not count towards your grade.

Quizzes will be available online for 24 hours, from 12 am through midnight on
the Thursdays noted on the syllabus. You will have 15 minutes to complete each
quiz, and you are expected to abide by the Virginia Tech Honor Code.

There will be no make-up quizzes. No exceptions.  

Examinations  
Three in-class closed-book examinations will be given on the dates listed on
the schedule below. Exams will be multiple choice, and will cover **all** of
the material from the course, including lectures, discussions,  and readings.

Please note the dates that exams are scheduled for. Make-ups will be given
only in the most dire of circumstances - due to serious illness, death in the
immediate family, or participation in an approved university activity - all of
which will require acceptable documentation from the Dean of Students. Please
see me before the exam to make the appropriate arrangements.

Final grades will be determined as follows:

Online Quizzes (best 8 out of 10)

**Honor Code**  
Students are expected to familiarize themselves with and adhere to the
[Virginia Tech Honor Code](http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/index.html) on all
assignments for this course. Although I strongly encourage students to work
together in study and review groups, all work submitted for a grade must be
your own.

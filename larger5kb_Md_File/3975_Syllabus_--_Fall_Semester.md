**Course Description**  
When one contemplates the phrase "global change," topics such as global
warming, overpopulation, and the ozone hole quickly come to mind. To fully
comprehend these issues, however, it is necessary to develop an appreciation
of the earth as a system that has been constantly changing in the 4.6 billion
years since its birth. This course, the first part of a three term sequence in
global change, investigates the physical nature of these changes &SHY; from
the big bang to the events of today.

In order to develop our understanding of the biological and physical processes
that sustain life on earth, it is necessary to draw on the knowledge and
viewpoints of several schools and departments at the University of Michigan,
including the Departments of Biology, Geology, Atmospheric and Space Sciences,
and the School of Natural Resources and Environment. Several professors and
guest lecturers will share their disciplines' contributions to our
understanding of global change.

Although the scope of the course may seem daunting, it is taught at a level
that all students, regardless of math and science background, will find
accessible and hopefully enjoyable. It is also our hope that you will benefit
from the academic diversity of your fellow students, who are from many
different units in the University.

As mentioned, this course is the first part of a three semester sequence in
global change issues, the second of which focuses on the human and social
aspects of these questions and the directs students to deeper analysis of
global change problems through three in depth case studies. The first semester
and semester cources may be taken may be taken in any order, but both
semesters are the prerequisite for the third course. Once these three courses
are completed, the required courses for the Global Change minor will have been
fulfilled.  


##  Course Requirements

**Lectures**  
Lectures meet from 12:00 noon to 1:00 pm Monday, Wednesday and Friday in the
Chemistry Building, Room 1400. The lecture material is the heart of the class,
and it is to your advantage to attend regularly. Although we understand that
it is not always possible for every student to attend every lecture, you are
responsible for **all** material covered in the lecture. Notes on many of the
topics covered will be provided on the Web page, but this is intended as a
supplement to, not a replacement for, active participation in lecture. If
necessary, we will begin to take attendance or give quizzes to assure regular
participation.  


**Reading Assignments and the World-Wide Web**  
Most of the reading materials for the class will be available as lecture notes
on our Web site, located at:

**<http://www.sprl.umich.edu/GCL>**

The topics on the Web site follow the order of the lecture outline, but the
material is not identical to that presented in class. The on-line lecture
notes serve as both a textbook and coursepack, and also connect you to other
material available on other Web sites. We will remind you in class and over
e-mail of what materials you should be reviewing form the Web site as we
progress through the course outline.

The Web site also includes lab materials and assignments, quicktime movies,
the course syllabi and outlines, and links to relevant information sources.
Materials on the Web are updated frequently; keeping current on the Web
material is an important part of the class.

There are no required textbooks or coursepacks; supplemental reading materials
will occasionally be distributed in class. The only costs you will incur are
for printing lecture notes and other Web materials.  


**Lab/Discussion**  
Your presence at lab/discussion sessions is mandatory. The lab/discussion
section meets for two hours per week, in a discussion classroom or an ITD
computer classroom (the location will be announced in Monday lecture and over
e-mail each week). Each lab/discussion session is worth 15 points, and
together they count for approximately 25% of your final grade. Attendance and
participation is worth five points each week, and the assignments will be
worth ten points. If an emergency arises and you are unable to attend your
session, you must contact the GSI prior to the session to reschedule or make
up the assignment.

Laboratory sessions meet in the ITD computing classrooms, and will involve use
of the dynamic modeling program STELLA. STELLA is an easy-to-use, graphically
based program which will allow us to investigate global change issues such as
ozone depletion, population growth, and greenhouse warming. Laboratory
assignments will generally contain a series of short questions to be answered
and must be submitted to your GSI the following week.

Discussion groups will give students and the GSIs an opportunity to discuss
the issues covered in lectures in smaller groups. Movies and a short field
trips to resources on campus (e.g., the Natural Science museum) will also play
a role. Discussion sections will usually include short assignments due the
following week.

Proper spelling, punctuation, and grammar are important in all written work
submitted for this class. If spelling is not your forte, **USE SPELL-CHECK**!  


**Projects**  
Sometime during the first few weeks of class, a discussion meeting will be
devoted to project brainstorming. Students are expected to organize themselves
into small teams of 2-3 people to develop an implementation plan for a term
project related to the course material. Suggestions for project topics will be
provided, but the choice will be left to each team with guidance from the lab
instructors.

Each project team is expected to develop a two page proposal for their
project, leading to the development of a poster presentation at the end of the
semester. The project proposal due date will be announced during the semester.
The project proposal will be reviewed by the teaching staff and returned with
comments and suggestions.

The physical format of the poster paper will be similar to that used in many
professional organizations: each poster paper will need an introduction,
statement of objectives, methodology, results and conclusions. Each group may
choose between presenting their projects as a traditional poster, or as a Web-
based electronic poster. Extra help will be available for groups choosing to
publish their work on the Web.  


**Tests**  
There will be two one-hour midterm exams and a two-hour final exam. The tests
will be comprised of a mixture of multiple choice and short-answer questions.
Material from the lecture and required readings (both on-line and handouts)
will be covered on all exams. The final exam will emphasize material covered
since the second midterm, but will also involve concepts studied before the
midterm.  


**Evaluation Activities**  
Introduction to Global Change is an experimental course that we are constantly
trying to improve. All students are expected to participate in our evaluation
activities, which will occur throughout the term. These generally consist of
short questionnaires and Web assessments. Students who do not participate in
these activities will **lose points** from their participation grade (see
below).

**Grading**  
The class will use a point system for determining final grades:

  * Midterms: 100 points each 
  * Final: 150 points 
  * Lab/Discussion Sessions: 15 points each 
  * Participation: 50 points 
  * Assignments: 25 points each 
  * Term Project: 150 points 

The final grade will be out of approximately 800 points. Extra credit points
may be offered for certain activities or assignments.

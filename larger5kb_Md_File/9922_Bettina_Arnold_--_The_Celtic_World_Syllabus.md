  |  **Course Description:**  
The Celtic-speaking peoples of continental Europe and the British Isles have
left us a rich archaeological, historical and mythological record. During the
pre-Roman Iron Age the remains of their settlements and burial grounds can be
found from Spain to the Black Sea, one of the reasons that they have recently
become a focus of research funded by the European Community. This course will
trace the archaeological beginnings of the Celtic tradition from its late
Neolithic/early Bronze Age roots to the western-most outposts of the Celtic
world in the British Isles. From fabulous gold jewelry to mysterious bog
bodies, the archaeology of the ancient Celts has it all! We will explore this
legacy through the archaeological, historical and literary records, with
reference to sites, monuments and written texts from the Mediterranean world
and the British Isles. The course will also explore the historical and
political construction of the concept of  "the Celts", which has become the
metaphor for the emerging and contested European community. How are cultures,
and ethnicity, defined, appropriated, debated? Various nationalist movements,
including those in Wales and Ireland, make use of the Celts as a vehicle for
their contemporary concerns. The course will consider the notion of
"Celticity" in the post-industrial era as well as its prehistoric roots.

  |  **Final Paper Guidelines**  

  1. Papers must be **typed** (computer or typewriter).   
  

  2. Each paper must be **15-20 pages** long. There is no length limit. **Paginate all pages beginning with Page 2!**  
  

  3. Summaries must be **double spaced**. (I also need to be able to write comments in the **margins** , so make sure these are **1 " all around**, no more, no less.)  
  

  4. You are expected to explore one of the topics from the reading further in written form. This can include citations from the reading but must include original ideas/thoughts/opinions, backed up by cogent arguments. You must cite **at least 10 sources**. Only **two** of these may be Web sources.  
  

  5. When citing sources (direct quotation or paraphrasing), the following rules apply:  
  
The author's last name ( include the first initial only if there are two
authors being cited in the paper with the same last name) followed by the year
of publication, a colon and the page number(s). (This is the standard
procedure in anthropological publications). Quotation marks should be used
where appropriate, as in the examples below.  
  
Example #1: "The moon is made of green cheese" (McDonald 1989:123).  
Example #2: According to Williams, the moon is made of fried green tomatoes  
  

  6. If you have experienced a burst of energy and ambition and have done some additional reading not assigned in the syllabus (unlikely but not impossible), then you should cite the authors as above.   
  

  7. You must include a bibliography with full references at the end of the paper. This includes Web resources. NOT ALL WEB SITES ARE CREATED EQUAL! See the following information on how to evaluate Web sites: **http://www.uwm.edu/letsci/edison/webevaluation/**  
  
Good luck! Contact me at barnold@uwm.edu if you have any other questions.  

|  
---|---|---  
  
  |  **Summaries**  

  1. You must produce brief, typewritten or computer-generated summaries of **three** (undergraduates) or **four** (graduate students) articles or chapters from the list of additional readings as scheduled in the syllabus. Each summary should be **at least one** paragraph long (single-spaced); they may be longer.  
  

  2. **Critique** the approach or problem outlined in the articles you have chosen by identifying both their limitations and their potential. Pay particular attention to the following questions in your summary:  

    1. What is/are the main point(s) of the chapter or article?  

    2. Are you convinced by the author'(s') reasoning? Why or why not?  

    3. What are your recommendations? Is the article worthwhile? Why or why not?  

    4. How could the argument(s) have been more persuasive or the approach more useful?    

  3. **Think critically!** This involves more than simply shooting holes in someone else's theory or approach. Demonstrate that you are able to see more than one side of an issue. Suggest alternatives. 
|  
---|---|---  
  
  |  **Group Presentations**  

  1. _Meet_ with members of your group **at least** two weeks before your group presentation. Do some searching of library resources at UWM and elsewhere to come up with additional sources on the assigned topic. Assign each group member an article or book chapter(s) related to the topic to read and summarize for the presentation. Set up a second meeting after reading the material.  
  

  2. _Prepare_ a set of **5** statements outlining the key points of your topic based on the additional information provided by the reading done by each group member. The statements should synthesize the various aspects of the topic. **Pool your work and expertise!** Imagine you are boiling the topic down to these 5 statements for a friend or roommate who knows nothing about the Celts. You may use visual aids such as handouts or overheads.  
  

  3. _Generate_ **three** discussion questions based on your five statements. These can be issues you think are not adequately resolved by the readings, problems you think need to be articulated in more detail, or questions you have about methodology or theoretical assumptions. **Produce a document** to hand out to members of the class on the day of the presentation that includes:  

    1. Title of topic  

    2. Names of all presenters  

    3. List of three discussion questions  

    4. References cited by all group members  
**Be sure to bring enough copies to class for all class members!  
**  

  4. _Produce_ a **one page (minimum)** document, signed by all the participants, to be handed in at the end of class on your group presentation day. Designate one group member to present a brief summary of the topic, and another to present questions to the class. All group members will be responsible for leading discussion for part of class that day.  
  
**Group Presentation due dates are listed on the syllabus!**

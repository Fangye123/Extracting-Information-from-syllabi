![Course Overview](13cover.gif)

This course has been organized to meet certain goals. The first is to provide
you with an overview of American history from 1900 through 1996. The second is
to introduce you to the way historians uncover and write history. The third is
to explore the relationship between contemporary events and politics and the
way history has been written. Finally, the course should help you to develop
your own interpretation of twentieth century American society and politics.

Because it is impossible to explore all of twentieth century American history
in ten weeks, this course will focus on three important issues: migration and
immigration, the evolution of the federal government, and the emergence of a
mass culture. These themes were chosen because they are critically important
for understanding modern America; because, taken together, they provide a
solid scaffolding for understanding the past century; and because they relate
to many other key issues 20th century issues.

Each part of the class-lectures, discussion sections, readings, and writing
assignments-should work together to fulfill the goals laid out for the class.
Students should plan to participate fully in each part.

![Readings](13cread.gif)

The following books are required reading for everyone. Copies are available at
the ASUCLA Bookstore and in reserve at Powell Library.

    Upton Sinclair, _The Jungle_      Frederick Lewis Allen, _Only Yesterday_      Upton Sinclair, _How I Ran for Governor and Got Licked_      Walter Mosley, _Devil in a Blue Dress_      Le L. Hyslip, _When Heaven and Earth Changed Place_      E. D. Hirsch, _Cultural Literacy_

There is no text book for this class. We have provided a
[timeline](jr97/13ctmln.html) in the class web site that should provide a
basic chronology to frame the lectures and materials. The web site also
contains basic reference materials pertinent to the topics we will be
discussing. We will help students without access to the World Wide Web to
secure accounts and everyone is encouraged to use the class web site
regularly. All required materials on the Web will be available in hard copy
for those without web access. (Please note that with the new CLICC labs,
everyone enrolled in the class does have access in those labs.)

![Evaluation](13ceval.gif)

Each student will be required to write three short (3-4 page) essays. Each of
these essays will account for 15% of your grade. There will be a take-home
final due on March 20, 1997 that will also account for 30% of your grade. The
final will ask you to tie together materials presented in the lectures,
readings, and your own research. Participation in the discussion sections will
account for 25% of your grade.

Discussion sections are critical for tying the various parts of this course
together. As a result, you are expected to attend all of them. Each unexcused
absence will lower your grade for discussion sections by a -. For example, if
you have done A work in your section but skip two sections, your section grade
would become B+.

![Assignments](13cassgn.gif)

_**Assignment 1: (Due in lecture-January 21)**_

Write a brief (3-4 pages) essay discussing what you consider to be the key
issues of immigration based on your reading of _The Jungle_. You might want to
consider such issues as reasons for emigrating, problems facing immigrants
when they arrive in a new country/city, notions of cultural maintenance and
adoption, prejudice, and the government's role in shaping those experiences.
However, do not feel constrained by those suggestions.

We will be revisiting the issues you raise in these essays again and again
throughout the quarter-in terms of African American migration out of the
South, migration from country to city to suburb, Mexican migration throughout
the century, and the new immigration of the 60s - 90s. For that reason, you
might want to consider the issues as broadly as possible.

As you write the essay, please keep in mind that The Jungle is a novel written
by a person who was not himself an immigrant. How important is that question
of authorship in using the book to understand immigration?

_**Assignment 2: (Due in lecture-February 11 )**_

From October of 1929 through the beginning of World War II, Americans suffered
through a prolonged economic depression that changed America forever. This
assignment had been designed to help you understand that depression AND to
explore the ways in which different historical sources can paint very
different pictures of what happened during the depression.

You will be expected to do primary research of a limited nature and write a
short essay (3-4 pages) on what your research uncovered about life during the
Great Depression. Your research can be done in a variety of sources. One such
possibility is the Works Progress Administration (WPA) interviews available
through the World Wide Web at the Library of Congress (URL available on class
web site). You could also read a novel such as The Grapes of Wrath that
chronicles one family's experiences. You could read a week of the Los Angeles
Times or a month of The Nation to see how the depression was reported in the
newspapers. Or, you could interview your gradparents if they remember the
depression to find out what they remember about it.

We will distribute a more complete list of appropriate sources during the
first week of class. Of course, you are also free to come up with your own
source AS LONG AS YOU DISCUSS IT WITH YOUR TA OR WITH PROFESSOR REIFF BEFORE
YOU WRITE THE PAPER.

**_Assignment 3: (Due in Lecture - March 4)_**

Many historians and cultural critics point to the 1960s as the beginning of
the so-called "culture wars," the period when different cultures clashed
openly and bitterly. This assignment asks you to consider how popular music
reflected that culture clash.

Each person will be expected to choose a recording artist or group and write a
brief (again 3-4 pages) essay that discusses the message of the person's or
group's lyrics or lifestyles in terms of the political and social issues of
the 1960s and early 1970s. For this assignment, the World Wide Web might be
particularly useful-60s rock is a hot topic on the Web. On the other hand, you
can as easily pick up a tape or CD of Sly and the Family Stone, Santana, the
Jefferson Airplane, or the Beatles and write a great essay on their lyrics.

**_Final Exam (due in TAs mailboxes NO LATER THAN March 20, 6:00 pm)**_

The take-home final exam will consist of two parts. The first part will ask
you to answer two of four questions that will be distributed on the last day
of class. These questions will ask you to bring together materials from the
entire course, chronologically and from sections, lectures, and readings.

The second part of the exam will ask you to challenge the last book you read
for the class, E. D. Hirsch's Cultural Literacy. Hirsch's book was highly
controversial when it appeared, especially its complete list of what every
educated American ought to know to be "culturally literate." Your task is to
write nominate no fewer than three and no more than five entries of your own
that you think people should know to be "culturally literate" in today's
America. The nomination should include an explanation of why that person,
event, institution, or idea is important. We will post all the entries
(anonymously) on the class CULTURAL LITERACY web site for you all to check at
the beginning of next quarter.

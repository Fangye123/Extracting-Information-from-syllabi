HISTORY 11
FALL 1998 RISE OF THE CHRISTIAN WEST

PURPOSE OF COURSE:  
To provide students with an understanding of the chronological development of
Western Europe from the late Roman Empire in the first century A.D., to the
start of the formation of nation-states in the mid-eleventh century.

COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
History 11 examines multicultural history in a medieval setting.  The time
period studied involved tremendous confrontations between different cultures
(Greco-Roman, Germanic, Celtic, Near Eastern; Christian, Moslem, Mediterranean
and Northern pagan, to name just a few), and their ultimate synthesis into the
concept Europe.  Because medieval people thought so often about the Roman
world from which their culture derived, and tried to model their institutions
upon those of Rome, we must spend a short time getting to know late classical
society.  This course extends from the height of the Roman Empire to the
middle of the eleventh century.  Topics will include the later Roman Empire
and its fall, the invasion of the Germanic/Gothic tribes, the development and
role of Christianity, the Carolingian Renaissance, the rise of feudalism, and
the western and eastern Frankish Empires (early France and Germany).
Political, economic, and cultural achievements will be stressed, but time will
also be spent on examining how ordinary people survived in the Middle Ages.
We will also place some emphasis upon interpretations of the period: theories
on the decline and fall of the Roman Empire; the Pirenne thesis, which
attempted a novel explanation of the start of the medieval world; and the
theories that helped shape the notion of the "Middle Ages".

Please note that this is a survey and provides only an introduction to the
early and high Middle Ages.  More specialized courses on the intermediate and
advanced levels are available in the History Department, for which History 11
acts as firm background.

OFFICE HOURS:  
My office hours, held in O'Kane 390 (phone 793-2358), will be announced later.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
Attendance is expected at all class meetings.  Excessive absences, defined at
the discretion of the professor, will result in failure in the course.  The
student, absent or not, is responsible for the content of lectures and
discussions of the class, and for all announcements made at such times.
Attendance is required for examinations; make-up exams are given only with
authorization from the student's class dean.  Attendance forms part of the
grade for discussion and participation, but perfect attendance with little or
no class discussion will not result in a perfect grade.  
There will be two midterm exams, two primary source analysis papers, and a
final (cumulative) examination.

ADVICE FOR EXAM-TAKING:  
Exam questions for the survey courses can take three different forms: a.) the
short identification, of people, place-names, things, concepts (examples:
Julius Caesar, Constantinople, Vulgate, comitatus);  b.) a short essay based
on one of the readings, including the textbook;  c.) a long essay requiring
synthesis of lecture, discussion, primary and secondary sources.

Exams should be prepared for by careful reading of the assigned passages.  You
should take notes on the readings, and not rely on highlighting passages in
the books.  You should actively compare and contrast lecture material with
what is found in the readings.  History requires you to master chronology, and
if this means you have to memorize dates in order to learn them, then
memorization becomes a part of your task.

For the identifications, apply the questions who, what, when, where (as many
as pertinent) to the question.  Most of all, it is important to identify the
historical importance of the item: why it appears in our course.  It is not
necessary to answer these identifications with a full essay, but you should be
complete in your response.

For the essays, because these form the largest part of the exam grade, it is
important to shape your response with a thesis, followed by the evidence that
informs it.  It is less important and appropriate to convey everything you
remember about the topic, than it is to argue your position and choose the
details that support it.  Because you are under time constraints, it is better
to declare your position on the topic early in the essay; in the time that
remains, argue the case with the evidence and the details you feel best prove
it.  Budget your time wisely so you can make all the points you believe are
vital.  Sometimes it is helpful to jot down the major points you wish to make,
to have in front of you so that you know what remains to be written in the
time left.  You don't have time for a full outline, but it often helps to note
a few key words to keep your essay on target.  These key words and concepts
can also help you to begin your essay with a full statement of the position
you wish to argue.  Including reference to primary sources in the essay gives
your argument added strength because you are citing contemporary evidence, and
not just interpretations of modern historians.

ADVICE FOR DAILY STUDYING:  
Most of the material encountered in this class will be entirely new to you.
The methodology may also be novel: taking a critical approach to primary and
secondary sources is much more challenging than accepting what authorities
wrote simply because it is in print.  Mastering this material and critical
outlook requires more effort on your part than you may have encountered in
high school history courses.  Learning the material, especially dates,
certainly requires the repetition of reading, re-reading, and careful note-
taking.  Do not underestimate the benefits this has for your powers of
organization and your capacity to think in a disciplined and rational manner.
Take responsibility for your studying: prepare for class before attending, at
the very least by skimming the text and readings to acquaint yourself with the
topics under discussion.  No one but you is responsible for the level of
interest which you bring to the task.  Entertainment is far less the object of
this class than an expansion of your understanding of human culture and human
achievement.

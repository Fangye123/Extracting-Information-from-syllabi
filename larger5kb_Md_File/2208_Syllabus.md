**This course examines the logic of research design and explores how data are
approached, collected and analyzed in an interactive information age.
Practical applications across disciplines introduce both the electronic and
traditional tools and techniques necessary to interpret and utilize findings.
Case studies and presentations prepare students to analyze, evaluate and
challenge specific applications and to suggest alternative interpretations.
Online databases and the WWW expand options.

TEXTBOOK: _[Research in an Electronic
Age](http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/ulib/ref/Research_Guide/Introd-Web.html)_ by
Brendan A. Rapple and Kwasi Sarkodie-Mensah.**

* * *

**READINGS FOR EACH CLASS:**  
**In addition to reading the assigned chapters from the Rapple/Sarkodie-Mensah
textbook, you will be required to read for most classes one or two other
chapters, articles etc.   For each of these latter readings _(indicated by an_
_* ) _you must write a brief summary/review (200 words _maximum_ for each
reading).   These summaries/reviews must be completed and handed in on the
evening the readings are to be discussed.**

**It is important that you read the weekly reading assignments. Each class
there will be a general discussion of the assigned articles. Your contribution
to the discussion will count for a substantial part of the 15 points given to
class participation.**

**MAJOR PAPER ASSIGNMENT**

**This will be a formal research proposal on a topic of your own choice (after
consultation with the instructor). Though there are many different ways to
compose a research proposal, the following elements should be included:**

**a) Title Page:**

> **The first page includes the title of the project, name of the
researcher(s) or organization proposing the research, and date. The
researcher's address, telephone number and title are often included. The title
should be brief but descriptive of the proposed project.**

**b) Table of Contents**  
    


**c) Executive Summary/Abstract:**

> **One-page maximum. This is a summary of each of the sections to alert the
reader, who is often too busy to read the whole proposal, to the important
information. Since many people will look only at the abstract, it is usually
helpful to point out the value of the proposed research results.**

**d) Research Problem or Area:**

> **A description of the specific problem or interest that is initiating the
research. Perhaps sales have fallen dramatically or the production department
wants a new process or the academic performance of the girls in your school
district is dramatically weaker than that in a neighboring district. Perhaps
it is an historical question, e.g. you wish to write a history of your company
or industry. Maybe it is a case study of the policy of affirmative action in
your company. At any rate, provide sufficient background in language that a
stranger to the problem can understand. (Bear in mind that the referees who
assess proposals and decide the funding do not always understand the
technicalities). This is also the section where a specific statement of the
purpose of the research in the form of hypotheses, research questions or
objectives is included.**

**e) Review of Literature:**

> **For the purpose of this assignment this is the most important section.
It should be the longest and you should spend the most time at it. Here you
will present what is so far known about the problem under consideration, thus
providing the setting for the questions or hypotheses of the proposed study.
The literature cited does not have to be exhaustive, but it should contain the
most pertinent related studies and show an awareness of promising current
practices. The literature should be organized by topic. Topical organization
serves to point out to the reader what is known about various aspects of the
study. Thus, a complete picture of the background of the study is put together
step by step. Of course, you should include theories and research results
contrary to the stated hypothesis as well as those in agreement with it. _For
the purpose of this assignment I want you to indicate that you have employed a
variety of different research tools (online, CD-ROM, print etc.) to locate
your literature._**

**f) Research Procedures:**

> **A description of the methodology to be used, e.g. the population, the
sampling methods, the research design, data collection methods, instruments
and data analyses. Even for a qualitative historical research proposal some
description of the appropriate methodology should be included. Charts and
graphs may be included but they should be placed in an appendix.**

**g) Limitations of study:**

> **Delineate the precise parameters of your research. This is an important
safety valve for you.**

**h) Expected Product of the Research:**

> **The form in which the outcomes of the research will be presented.**

**i) Time Schedule:**

> **A realistic estimate of time required to complete the project.**

**j) References:**

> **A listing of the authors and information about their publications to which
you referred in the body of the proposal (e.g. in the review of the
literature).**

  
**Optional sections might include:**

>   * **Budget:    A detailed listing of costs of the project.**

>

>   * **Appendices:     Charts, graphs and other information which may
interfere with the flow of the proposal or lengthen it may be placed in the
appendices.**

>

>   * **Researcher's R esume:    A listing of the qualifications of the
researcher. This should include any similar projects the researcher has
completed and the researcher's unique qualifications for the project. Business
and educational backgrounds may be included.**

![](image4.gif) Grading Policy  


**a) 2 exams worth 35% each**  
Exams will consist of short answers and essay. No multiple choice questions
will be asked. Emphasis will be placed on clear expression of arguments and
conclusions based on the examination of various kinds of data. No make-up
exams will be given except in case of documented medical emergency.

**b) homework assignments worth a total of 30%**  
There will be eight short papers due during the term. They will be one or two
page essays responding to specific questions designed to prepare you for the
day's discussion. For that reason, no late papers will be accepted. These
papers will be graded pass/pass minus/not pass, and one grade will be dropped
at the end of the semester. A "Pass" counts as an "A" (95), a "Pass Minus"
counts as a "C" (75), a "Not Pass" counts as an "F" (50), and any paper not
turned in counts as a 0. Any student who receives a grade of "Pass" on every
paper assigned will receive an "A+" for the final homework average, which
counts as a 100\. All papers must be typed, unless other arrangements are made
with the instructors. The papers are listed on the syllabus on the date due.

**c) Participation and Attendance**  
The class will be discussion oriented, so regular participation is
recommended. Consistent participation in discussion will be noticed and taken
in to consideration when determining final grades. If you must miss class for
some reason, you will be responsible for the material you missed. You will be
expected to get the notes and assignments from another student or two and to
be prepared the next time you come to class. At the midterm, the instructor
will begin taking attendance for those students suspected of missing class
regularly. If it becomes obvious at any time that a student is missing class
or other work, the instructor has the right to fail the student for extensive
non-attendance, whether or not the absences are excused, after an attempt has
been made to warn the offending student.

**d) Academic Honesty**

Students are expected to review and abide by University policies concerning
academic dishonesty. In addition to published standards, it is the opinion of
this instructor that providing class notes for publication on the internet or
using such notes posted by others are both instances of academic dishonesty.
Any evidence of a student engaging in such activity will result in failure for
the course on the grounds of academic dishonesty. I feel that such activity is
contrary to the true spirit of education and interferes with the effectiveness
of the course and my methods of teaching, and I will take such activity as a
professional injury and a personal insult.  


Course Objectives  
In this course we will take a critical yet sympathetic view of a wide range of
religious traditions, including Native American, Hindu, Buddhist, Daoist,
Jewish, Christian, and Muslim. This will require that we allow ourselves both
to identify with and to maintain our distance from each of the traditions
covered. We propose to explore textual roots and fundamental concerns, and to
look for similarities and differences. We will not be experts on World
Religions after taking this course, but we will be more sensitive to the kinds
of issues at stake in the study of religion, and more familiar with the
origins and evolutions of today's living religions, both Eastern and Western.
In general, it must be remembered that this is a philosophy class, so that
emphasis will be placed on critical thinking, clarity, and argumentation.

**American Studies 1001  
American Culture: Pre-Contact to Civil War**

6:00-8:30, 140 Blegen Hall

Instructor: Susanne B. Dietzel

**Course Description:**  
This course focuses on selected aspects of American culture from the sixteenth
to the nineteenth century. In particular, this course will examine the complex
encounters and interactions between Native Americans, British colonists, and
African slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries. The course is organized
around three units -- Myths of Origin and "Discovery," Contact and Conflict,
and Visions of Community and Nation. Underlying these units is the assumption
that American culture was (and is) shaped by the historical encounters of
different racial and economic groups. Drawing on different sources -- history,
oral history, literature, popular culture, and art -- from different regions
-- pre-contact North America, England, the American Northeast and the South
\-- we will examine how these different groups imagined themselves and their
world, dealt with and resisted contact and interaction, created community, and
designed a nation. In particular, we will pay close attention to the meanings
given to these concepts both by individuals and specific groups.

Attendance and class participation are absolutely necessary for this class.
Attendance will be checked for every class session. More than one absences

when you were absent. To receive a passing grade all assigned work has to be
completed. Incompletes will be given only in genuine emergencies. Papers have

accepted in emergency circumstances, otherwise they will be graded down (one
third of a grade per day late). Students taking the class on an S/N basis must
earn at least a C to pass. Grading is done in accordance with CLA guidelines:

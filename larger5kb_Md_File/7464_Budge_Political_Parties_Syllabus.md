Modern democracy is above all party democracy. Parties organize electoral
choices and ensure that popular priorities get translated into government
policy. It is no coincidence that the first step towards full democracy in
Central and Eastern Europe was the formation of new political parties.

Parties are the great social invention of the modern age, on a part with
electricity and computers on the technological side. Mass democracies cannot
do without them. This makes it important to examine claims about their decline
or ideas that they have abandoned their key ideologies (often made about
Socialist parties).

The course is divided into five parts. The first examines ideas about parties
and democracy at an analytical level (e.g., what does it mean to say that
parties are, or are not, in decline?).

The second examines party families and party systems across democracies.

The third looks at party competition in elections and how this is affected by
societal developments and the electoral system, i.e. the rules for translating
party vote shares into legislative seats. On the other side, we examine how
and why electors choose to vote for particular parties.

The fourth part of the course looks at parties in government - how governments
are formed, ministries distributed and policies made.

In the fifth part we pull all these threads together, to see how democracy
functions as a whole in the modern age.

**Course Objectives**

By the end of the course you should:

  * Know a lot about parties and the democracies they operate in, but especially in Europe which has the greatest variety of functioning parties in the World.
  * Have reviewed all the main explanations of why people vote for parties and how parties complete for votes.
  * Have viewed all the main explanation s of how parties form and run governments.
  * Be able to offer reasoned judgements on the workings of party democracy across the world.

**Teaching**

This course is focused on one 3 hour seminar a week. The seminar is a flexible
format which allows, above all, for informed discussion and dialogue. The
emphasis is on discussion, assuming that relevant information and background
knowledge are already assimilated. To facilitate this all participants in the
course prepare a 1-2 page paper on the subject to be discussed. Topics are
listed, along with reading, under each seminar.

**Assessment**

The weekly papers are used to raise or lower the course grade primarily
awarded on the basis of the term paper you write in the course. Paper topics
are attached to this syllabus. Final grades will be the essay mark, with some
input from the class papers.

Feel free to come and talk with me, after the seminar or during office hours,
if you have any problems or difficulties with the course. Office hours will be
notified and posted on the door of my office. Appointments can be made for
other times by arrangement.

**General Reading**

Specific reading is listed below for each seminar. The general books you
should read in full and buy are:

Alan Ware, _Political Parties and Party Systems_ , (OUP, 1996)

Ian Budge and Hans Keman, _Parties and Democracy_ , paperback edition (OUP,
1993)

In addition you should read through Ian Budge, Kenneth Newton, et a. _The
Politics of the New Europe_. (London and New York: Addison Wesley Longman,
1997). This gives much factual information on parties, social movements and
interest groups in Western and Eastern Europe, which will be useful, as well
as a lot of insight into the politics of individual countries.

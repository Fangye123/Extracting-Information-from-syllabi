History of Twentieth-Century
Europe
 Final
Grades



At the beginning of the 20th century
Europe was at the height of its political and economic power, as well as
in the midst of profound social and cultural change. The democratic and
industrial revolutions of the late 18th century had by 1900 radically altered
the conditions of life for the mass of the European population. Industrial
production had created the world's first consumer societies, and while
aristocratic elites still largely controlled the European states, mass
opinion and democratic demands strongly influenced political decisions.
Competing economic theories were marshaled to support worker and capitalist
visions of a just society, while movements for women's emancipation pressed
for greater access to political and economic power. From standards of representation
in art to theories of the mind, previous intellectual certainties were
called into question and fiercely debated. While Japan and the United States
had shown that states outside of Europe could master the new industrial
and military technology, the European powers had an overwhelming advantage
in these areas, as their successful imperialist expansions in the late
19th century made evident. 
Yet the situation within Europe was
far from stable, and many of the economic, political, and social forces
that contributed to Europe's rise to world power were also responsible
for its near destruction by the mid-point of the century. The European
powers were dominant in 1900, yet for most of the last fifty years of the
20th century they remained hostage to competing Cold War armies, and were
forced to relinquish their world empires. Even so, Europe managed to regain
its prosperity and its political autonomy in the decades after World War
II, reinventing many aspects of its political, social, and economic institutions
in ways that have proved more durable and lasting than those based on the
unbridled national competition that was the hallmark of the first half
of the 20th century. 
The story of Europe's rise, destruction,
and reconstruction over the last hundred years is the focus of this course.

- Attendance and Discussion Participation
- 
A sign-in sheet will be passed around
for each class meeting. Because there are only nine class meetings available
for lecture and discussion, after the first unexcused absence your grade
may be effected. Please discuss any potential schedule problems with me
before they arise. All students are expected to participate in discussions,
and come to class with questions formulated in the process of writing the
reaction papers.
 
- Reaction Papers - 
Each student will be required to
write a reaction paper for each of the four primary source works used in
the class. Reaction papers should demonstrate a knowledge of the book,
but they should not simply be a summary of its contents. In these papers
you should relate the material in the book to the themes of the course
found in the textbook, the lectures, and/or the films. The process of writing
these papers is meant to prepare students for the class discussion of the
primary source works, and part of this preparation includes formulating
two questsions that can be asked within class discussion. Papers should
be between two and three pages.

- Final Exam - 
The final exam will consist of identifications
and essay questions. Identification terms  will be drawn from the
key terms listed on the outline for each lecture. You will have a choice
of essay questions, each of which will require you to discuss broad themes
within the material. Reviews of potential essay themes will addressed in
discussions.

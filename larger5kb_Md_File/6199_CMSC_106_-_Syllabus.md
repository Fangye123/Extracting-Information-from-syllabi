### 2\. Introduction

     CMSC 106 is an introduction to computing and program development in the C programming language. This includes a brief introduction to basic computer concepts, an understanding of the UNIX operating system sufficient for writing class programming assignments, thoroughly studying the syntax and semantics of the basic control structures of C, learning C's fundamental data structures, understanding the design and methodical construction of computer programs, learning how to test and debug programs, and, lastly, practice in all of these through creating several programs in C. 

Computer programming is by its nature inherently mathematical; learning a
programming language is challenging and difficult, and hard work for most
students. This is especially true of the later programming assignments in CMSC
106. However, the only way to fully learn programming language concepts is to
use them, by writing programs. For this reason, students who do not complete
the assigned programming projects will find it very difficult to perform
adequately on the exams.

Students who already know C or who have extensive Pascal experience **should
not** be taking 106, and should be enrolled in CMSC 114 instead. Ask your
instructor for details.

### 3\. Teaching Assitants (TAs)

     The teaching assistants for this course will be announced in class. The TAs will hold office hours on a walk-in basis for tutoring and questions about the course material, as well as assistance with the programming projects, in 1151 A. V. Williams. 

### 4\. Office Hours

     The instructors' office hours are the following: Monday through Friday from 11-12 a.m. The TAs' office hours will be provided in lecture and available in the class posting account (see below). 

Our email addresses are supplied so you can contact us when necessary in
emergency situations, but we regret that we have insufficient resources to
debug students' projects via email. We strive to answer email in as timely a
fashion as possible but cannot always guarantee how quickly that may be. We
will generally be unable to answer substantive questions on course material
via email; these are more appropriate for class discussion or office hours.
Office hours are the preferred means of communicating with us and the quickest
way to receive a reply.

### 5\. Textbook

     **Text:** _C Programming - A Modern Approach_ , K.N. King, W.W. Norton, (C) 1996\.   
  

### 6\. Posting Acount

     Various course materials will be made available in the course posting account, to be explained further in lecture. Important announcements will be made available electronically through the course posting account; students are responsible for reading these and knowing their contents. Directions for obtaining course materials in the posting accounts and reading the announcements will be provided in class. Projects will be submitted electronically and instructions will appear on the assignments. 

### 7\. Course Requirements and Grading

     Programming projects:  |  6 coding assignments  |  40%   
---|---|---  
Midterms:  |  one midterm  |  20%  
Final:  |  will be comprehensive  |  30%  
Quizzes:  |  approximately 6 quizzes, on reading, and lecture material  |  10%  
  
Homework exercises and solutions will be made available in the course posting
account; these will not be collected or graded, but serve as practice for you
to test your knowledge of the material, and as preparation for exams, quizzes,
and projects. Solutions to the even-numbered exercises in the text will be
provided in the posting account as each chapter is covered. You should read
the relevant chapters and solve the homework exercises when topics are first
presented in lecture, as this will help insure you are prepared when it is
time to write the programming assignment requiring this material.

### 8\. Project Grading Policy

    

  * All projects will be due at 4:00 p.m. on the day indicated on the project assignment. A project will be accepted up to one day late with a 20% penalty. After one day late, the project will receive a 0 grade. All projects will be graded out of 100 points, but as the summer progresses they will increase in difficulty, and consequently count more towards the final grade. The percentage associated with each project is the following: 
    
        P1 -> 1%, P2 -> 3% P3 -> 6%, P4 -> 10%, P5 -> 10%, P6 -> 10%
    

  * If you have both and ontime and a late project submission, then only the late project submission will be graded. 
  * Any questions about graded projects should first go to the teaching assistant who graded it. 
  * Any grade claim (about exams, quizzes, projects, etc.) MUST be done one within two days of receiving the graded material. NO grade claims will be accepted afterwards. 
  * Don't expect TAs or the instructor to do the debugging of your projects; suggestions can be provided during office hours about what is wrong with a project, but the student is responsible for debugging a project. 

If you have access to another computer with a C compiler, you may work on your
programming projects there. **However,** all project submissions must be made
from your class account, and must run and work correctly using the C compiler
available there (cc, with the -std1 option). Several C compilers for the PC
have subtle differences or incompatibilities compared to the aITs UNIX Class
Cluster's C compiler. The TAs only have access to your class account in office
hours, and cannot help debug any program written on any other computer except
from a printout. It is your responsibility to find out how to transfer a
program to your class account for submission (see the Information Technology
Library in 1400 CSS for information on transferring files between computers)
and to insure it works correctly there. If you want to attempt writing any
project on another system you are strongly recommended to complete it
**several days early** , in case any problems arise.

Under **no circumstances** will any emailed project, or project submitted by
any means other than that specified on the assignment be considered.

### 9\. Late Policies

    

As discussed above, projects may be submitted up to one day late for a 20%
deduction in credit. In the case of **major** illness, accident, or family or
personal emergency, an extension will be considered if your instructor is
notified {\bf in advance} of the due date, either in person, by email, or by
phone. An illness is considered severe enough to warrant an extension on a
project if a medical doctor states that you were **incapacitated** by it. Only
in cases of illness or emergency so serious that advance notice is impossible,
such as in cases of major illness, accident, or emergency, with documentation
to that effect as described below, will an extension be considered without
advance approval. In such cases it is your responsibility to notify your
instructor as promptly as possible, otherwise an excused absence will not be
granted. Unless your instructor was notified of any extenuating circumstances
**before** a project assignment has been graded and returned, **no extension**
will be considered under **any** circumstances, even with proper
documentation.

There will be **no** make-ups for hourly exams. In the case of a documented
medical excuse or documented family or personal emergency a missed exam or
quiz grade will be calculated by averaging your scores for the other exams or
quizzes.

**Excused absences for quizzes or exams, or extensions on projects, will be
approved only with proper documentation.** If you have a valid reason for
missing an exam or quiz or requesting an extension on a project, it is your
responsibility to have the proper verification. A medical excuse consists of
written verification from the Health Center, or a letter from your personal
physician stating that you were incapacitated and listing exact dates of
incapacitation. If you have a ``Verification of Visit'' form from the Health
Center, you **must** request that the health provider specifically write on it
your dates of incapacitation, otherwise the excuse **will not be accepted.**
You may have to sign a release at the Health Center in order to permit your
dates of incapacitation to be listed. If you will be missing an exam or quiz
for any reason other than medical (e.g., a job interview or University
function), you must contact your instructor **in advance**.

### 10\. Tentative Exam Dates

    

Exams will be held on the dates below unless a change is necessary to
accommodate lecture topics. In that case, the revised date will be announced
in lecture and posted in the course posting account. If you have a conflict
with another final, it is your obligation to inform your instructor as soon as
possible. Students' final exams will be rescheduled only due to their having
another course's final at the same time.

Exam 1:  |  Wednesday,   July 5,   9:30 - 10:50 a.m.  
---|---  
Final Exam:  |  Friday,   July 28,   9:30 - 10:50 a.m.  
  
The dates of quizzes will be announced in advance in discussion section.

### 11\. Academic Honesty Statement

    

**Please carefully read and consider** the Computer Science Department policy
regarding the use of computer systems, and the Academic Instructional
Technology Services' policy regarding acceptable use of computer accounts
provided for instructional use, in the Spring 2000 issue of the departmental
newsletter, CS Tid-Bits, passed out in class. Note in particular the penalties
for impermissible cooperation on programming projects, which is a violation of
the University's Code of Academic Integrity. **Any evidence of unacceptable
use of computer accounts or unauthorized cooperation on tests, quizzes, or
projects will be submitted to the Student Honor Council, which could result in
an XF for the course, suspension, or expulsion from the University.** NOTE
SPECIFICALLY: projects are to be done INDIVIDUALLY. Working IN ANY WAY with
another student will be considered a violation and WILL BE REPORTED to the
Honor Council.

#### VIOLATIONS OF ACADEMIC HONESTY INCLUDE:

  1. failing to do all or any of the work on a project by yourself, other than assistance from the instructional staff. 
  2. using any ideas or any part of another student's project, or copying any other individual's work in any way. 
  3. giving any parts or ideas from your project to another student. 
  4. having programs on an open account or on a PC that other students can access. 
  5. transferring any part of a project to or from another student or individual by any means, electronic or otherwise. 

**For academic honesty purposes, projects are to be considered comparable to
an extended take-home exam. That is, any cooperation or exchange of ideas
which would be prohibited on an exam is _also_ prohibited on a project
assignment.** Should you have difficulty with a programming assignment you
should **see your instructor or teaching assistants in office hours** , NOT
solicit help from anyone else in violation of these rules. Students are
welcome to study together or solicit help in learning C language concepts from
any others, including tutors, but quizzes, exams, and projects are to be
solely and entirely your own work. Only after you have received a numeric
grade for a project you are welcome, and encouraged, to compare it with any
classmates who have also received a numeric grade for that project assignment.

IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY, UNDER THE UNIVERSITY'S HONOR POLICY, OF ANY STUDENT
WHO LEARNS OF AN INCIDENT OF ACADEMIC DISHONESTY TO REPORT IT TO THEIR
INSTRUCTOR.

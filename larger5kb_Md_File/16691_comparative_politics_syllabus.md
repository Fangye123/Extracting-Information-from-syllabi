Americans, separated by the Atlantic, Pacific, Mexico, and Canada from the
rest of the world, have often been prone to a kind of ethnocentrism when it
comes to thinking about politics. We have the "separation of powers,"
"judicial review," a "two party system," and all those other wonderful things
we learned about in high school government class, and we often find ourselves
telling other countries that they ought to have all of these things too.

This course is designed, first, to show you that there are other ways of
running politics besides the American way. We will be looking closely at the
governments of Great Britain, France, Japan, China, and Brazil, examining
parliamentary systems, multi-party systems, one- party dominant systems,
communist party dominated systems, and systems seeking to establish
themselves.

At the same time, the course is designed to introduce you to the field of
"comparative politics" where we seek to understand _why_ different countries
have developed different kinds of governments and _whether all of this makes
any difference_.

**_REQUIREMENTS_** :

Students are expected to do all of the reading on a timely basis. Don't
procrastinate because the reading gets heavier later in the semester! Your
grade will be based on the following components: two in-class blue-book
**exams** , each worth 20% of your grade, based on the lectures and the
reading; one 5 page **essay** (10%); a 15 page **term paper** (30%); and
**participation in your discussion sections** (20%).

The writing required for the course (which satisfies the university's Second
Writing Requirement) is probably heavier than some of you may have expected.
It is designed to provide you with some writing skills which should serve you
well in subsequent upper-division courses. Your discussion grade will depend,
as noted, on "participation," which means it will be an assessment of the
degree to which you attend and contribute in a lively and _informed_ fashion.
The paper requirement asks you to choose and examine a "puzzling" pairing of
one general theory about politics with one country _other than_ the five
studied in this course. It will be up to the student to identify the "puzzle,"
do some extra reading on the theory he or she will focus upon, and do library
research on the country of choice. Both Prof. Schoppa and the TAs will provide
additional guidance and will be available for consultations once you choose
your topic.   On the web version the syllabus, you may click
**[here](http://www.people.Virginia.EDU/~ljs2k/cppaper.html)** for more
information.  


**_READINGS_** :

The following book will be read in full, or in large part. Copies should be
available in the book store. In addition, it is strongly recommended that you
purchase a reader composed of the starred (*) articles which is available
through the Copy Shop at 5b Elliewood Avenue.

W. Phillips Shively, _Comparative Governance_ Custom Text (McGraw Hill Primis,
1999).

An additional resource we will use throughout the course will be the **World
Wide Web**.   To assist the class in accessing information on the web related
to politics in Britain, France, Japan, Brazil, and China, the web version of
this syllabus will function as a "gateway" which you should bookmark through
the use of web browsing software on whatever computer you use with the
greatest frequency.  The syllabus can also be accessed by typing in the
address indicated at the top of this page.  Note that to take full advantage
of the always changing content on the web, I will be adding web-based
assignments as the term progresses.  In all cases, you will be able to access
the required sites by using the web version of this syllabus as your jumping
off point.

PROF. SCHOPPA's CLASS RULES

1\. MISSED TESTS  
You should notify me _before_ the exams if, for some reason, you will not be
able to make it on that date. Permission will only be given in exceptional
cases, and make-ups will be scheduled either before or after the regularly
scheduled date--at professor's convenience.   Note that final exams can only
be rescheduled under strict conditions established under College rules.

2\. LATE PAPERS  
The final grade on the paper will be docked one letter unit for every day it
is late unless delay has been approved by me (based on a very good reason) at
least a week before the due date. Last minute computer problems are not an
excuse!!! Back-up your work on disks to avoid losing it, and leave time for
you to deal with last minute hitches (like a broken printer, a line in the
computer lab) by aiming to finish well before the deadline.

Since 1900 Europeans have witnessed an astonishing number of changes. In fact,
some of the most dramatic transformations of this century have come about in
the past decade as a result of the sudden and unexpected collapse of communist
systems in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.  Among the far-reaching
consequences of these recent developments have been the resurgence of
nationalist/regionalist sentiments, the redrawing of political boundaries, and
the acceleration of the movement towards transnational economic and political
integration.  Although this is not a course in current affairs, we will be
studying the major historical events of the past one hundred years that have
given rise to the contemporary European scene.  Some of the themes we will be
exploring are: the origins and outcomes of the two world wars, the varieties
of political ideologies, and the patterns of modern European social
development.  


**REQUIRED TEXTS: (Paperback editions available through Gator Textbooks,
Creekside Mall.)**

Europe in our Time,  Walter Laqueur  
The Magic Latern,  Timothy Garton Ash  
Europe, 1880-1945, Second Edition, J.M. Roberts  
Sophisticated Rebels, H.Stuart Hughes  
Aspects of Western Civilization, Third Edition, Perry M. Rogers, Volume II.

*Recommended readings: From time to time I shall hand out duplicated sections from other primary and secondary sources. The student is strongly encouraged to read these in conjunction with the required textbooks.

**Reading Assignments:**

It is essential for you to complete all the reading assignments for each
segment of the course.  Please note that you will have to establish your own
reading schedule. That is, instead of being assigned a specific number of
pages to read each week, you are expected to read through all the given texts
and determine for yourself how much you need to read in order to understand
the topics being covered in the weekly lectures etc.   Given that the texts
themselves cover a great deal of material (and therefore makes for rather
dense reading) you  should always make it habit of re-reading key chapters and
your accompanying class notes. You should also take note of the fact that the
required texts cannot possibly cover every aspect of the 20th-century in-
depth. Please consult the bibliographies of the various texts to provide you
with sources that can be used to supplement your assigned readings.  


**EXAMS AND GRADING:**

There will be two in-class essay-type examinations (a mid-term and final) and
one term/research paper (10 double-spaced pp.).  The exams will be based on
the lectures and the required reading assignments.  Students will also be
graded on class participation, which means contributing to group discussions
in a meaningful way.   Please note that, as class lectures do not always
follow the assigned texts, attendance is mandatory.  Your final grade will be
calculated using the following formula:  


Two Exams = 60%  
Term essay =  30%  
Class participation = 10%

**Course Requirements**  

**Required Texts**

Nash, _et al_ :|  **_The American People; Creating a Nation and a Society_**  
Brief Third Edition; Volume 1 (to 1877)  
---|---  
Davidson and Lytle:|  **_After the Fact; The Art of Historical Detection_**  
Fourth Edition, Volume 1  
  
  

* * *

  

**Grades:** There will be 3 tests and 3 short reports. Each of the first two
tests will count 15% of the final grade. **The final exam IS cumulative** and
will count 25% of the final grade. Each short report constitutes 10% of the
final grade. The remaining 15% of the final grade will be derived from student
participation in classroom exercises.  
  

* * *

**Participation:** I expect you to complete the readings for the day before
coming to class. If you fail to demonstrate that you are prepared, I will
count you as absent. I may require your active participation in classroom
exercises to demonstrate the degree of your preparations. Also, each day we
will have web-based readings in addition to the readings in the texts. In
order to gain entry into the classroom, I require that you bring a typed 1-2
sentence summary of each of the day's web readings. If you do not bring a
typed summary, I will not let you into class. I refuse to accept summaries
that are emailed to me as substitutes for your ticket to enter class. Plan
ahead, as the printer will most assuredly stop working if you try to print out
your ticket just prior to class.  
  

* * *

**Attendance:** Since participation counts toward your grade, I require you to
attend class. If you miss three classes for any reason, your final grade will
be reduced 10 points. **Five absences (for any reason) will result in an
"F"**. Tardiness will only be tolerated within limits. If you are more than 15
minutes late for class, don't bother coming in because I will count you as
absent. If you are consistently tardy I may ask you to stop coming to class.  
  

* * *

## Short Reports:

Four times during the semester you will be required to submit a three to five
page typed (standard fonts and margins) reaction to a chapter in the Davidson
and Lytle book, _After the Fact_. You should answer the following questions in
each of your short reports: What was subject of this chapter? What questions
about the subject did historians find interesting and why? What different
explanations were offered to answer the questions and what sources and methods
did each explanation use? Which explanation seems more probable to you and
why?

Each of you will be required to write a short report in the first week of
class about the Prologue of the book. This report will be ungraded but
required for entry into class on the day it is due. **As an exception, this
paper need only be two-three pages in length, but you are required to bring
two copies of this short report to class.**

You will then pick three of seven options for your remaining short reports. At
least one must be completed before the last day to withdraw from classes for
the semester (February 29). Since you have many options, all deadlines are
firm. Late or emailed submissions will not be accepted.

**Short Report Deadlines:** **Chapters** | **Chapter Title** | **Pages** |
**Due Date**  
---|---|---|---  
Prologue | The Strange Death of Silas Deane | pp. xiii-xxix | January 13  
One | Serving Time in Virginia | pp. 1-22 | January 25  
Two | The Visible and Invisible Worlds of Salem | pp. 23-47 | February 1  
Three | Declaring Independence | pp. 48-70 | February 17  
Four | Jackson's Frontier -- and Turner's | pp. 71-95 | March 9  
Five | The Invisible Pioneers | pp. 96-121 | April 4

A quick note about plagiarism. Plagiarism is the quoting or the paraphrasing
of any portion of another author's words or ideas without giving full credit
to the original author. In short, it is theft of intellectual property. Anyone
caught plagiarizing in any part of the assignments for this class (short
reports, daily summaries, or tests) will dealt with according to the academic
integrity policy found in the student handbook.  
  

* * *

**Tests:** The first two tests each will take one class period (75 minutes).
The third test will take place during finals and will receive the allotted
time for a final. Approximately half of each test will be objective questions
including (but not limited to) multiple choice questions and chronology
matching, while the remainder of each test will consist of an essay.  
  

* * *

**Make-up Tests:** All make-up tests will be essay tests and will take place
on the last day of class for the semester. If you know you will miss an exam,
you should let me know as soon as you know, and at least **3 class days** in
advance of the test. If an emergency unavoidably prevents you from attending a
test, you should contact me immediately following your return to school and
provide me with whatever documentation I will require to allow you to take a
make-up. If you fail to contact me in a timely manner, I will not permit the
make-up.  
  

* * *

**Final Exam Conflicts:** You must tell me at least 2 weeks before the end of
classes that you have a conflict or you will have to work out the conflict
with someone else.

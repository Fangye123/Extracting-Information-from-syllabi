> > **"Explores Aztec history and culture. Provides an overview of the events
that shaped and destroyed the Aztec empire." **

>>

>> **" Aztec myth prophesied that a great city would one day stand on the site
where an eagle, perched on a cactus with a serpent in its mouth, was found.
Today, Mexico City stands o this mythical site. Although the Aztec Empire fell
on April 28, 1521, when Hernando Cortes and his army defeated Montezuma,
traces of the thousand-year-old pre-Columbian empire still survive and
influence world culture. This program explores Aztec culture and history, from
the role of human sacrifice in the Aztec religion to their agricultural
advances. Commentary by scholars, maps, and contemporary accounts provide an
overview of the events that both shaped and destroyed an empire." **\-- Films
for the Humanities and Sciences

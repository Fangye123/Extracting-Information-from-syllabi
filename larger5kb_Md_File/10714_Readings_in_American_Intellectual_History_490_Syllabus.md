**Scope and Objectives of Course**

This course is designed to span the history of American thought from the
Puritans through the Enlightenment, the Romantic Revolution, and the initial
impact of Darwin. Course objectives include an understanding of the subject
matter, writing and communication skills development, logic and critical
thinking, and the ability to synthesize ideas.  

The principles upon which this course are based include the following: (1)
knowledge is acquired through thinking; (2) students can learn what to think
only as they learn how to think; (3) to become educated is to learn how to
gather, analyze, synthesize, assess, and apply information for oneself; (4)
discussion, focused on issues, is a better sign of learning than silent
students passively accepting what the instructor says; (5) students gain
significant knowledge only if they value it; (6) information should be
presented so as to be understandable from the point of view of the learner;
(7) students learn best by working with other students in settings that
generate mutually supportive debate and empathic exchange of ideas; and (8)
students need intellectual standards to assess their thinking and the thinking
of others.  

To be successful learners, students must experience raised expectations,
whether through internal motivation or external encouragement. Accordingly,
this course is developed around six key principles:

  1. * individualized experiences
  2. * supportive climate
  3. * clear expectations of performance
  4. * tailoring assignments to meet individual needs and interests
  5. * feedback on work in progress
  6. * celebration of success

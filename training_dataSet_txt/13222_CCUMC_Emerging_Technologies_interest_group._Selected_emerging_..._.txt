Video-data projectors; Remote control systems

Projector issues: Smaller, brighter, cheaper, cost of lamps, standardization of lamps, 
DLP versus other technologies, compatibility with HDTV such as 1080i and 720p., new connectors and control.  


New trends: Port replicators and connections via Cat-5 cabling (RJ-45 connectors included on projectors).  Digital (DVI) connectors, mainly for computers with flat-panel displays.  Component video connectors (YPbPr) in addition to the usual RGB for handling DTV.  Monitoring and control through IP (Internet Protocol). Higher resolutions (such as SXGA-native or better) at lower prices.  Wireless technology in projectors.

Side issues; The move of high-end electronic control systems (Crestron, AMX) toward web-based systems and IP (Internet Protocol).  Cable length and control limitations for DVI.  Returning to push-buttons; the advent of a number of lower-cost remote control systems.

The Projector Central  site has a very useful  projector 
database that lists the specifications and other useful information for most data/video projectors old and new.  
Here is a page showing the various DVI connectors. 

 The  Digital Display Working Group  came up with the DVI specification.

HDTV and DTV

Issues: Formats and compatibility
Info sources:
FCC information sources on DTV
FCC is the Federal Communications Commission

Although DTV is only one area of study, the FCC also has an office studying emerging (and converging) technologies.  The FCC Technological Advisory Council
Pctechguide.com
has an excellent introduction, and technical overview for digital video including HDTV (despite sometimes annoying ads)




DVD

General issues: Region codes, recorders (DVD-R, DVD+R, DVD-RW, DVD-RAM, etc.), compatibility with HDTV, CSS code cracking and copying, CSS preloaded on DVD-R general disks.  "General" versus "authoring" drives and media.  Production issues. Less expensive standalone DVD-R recorders.

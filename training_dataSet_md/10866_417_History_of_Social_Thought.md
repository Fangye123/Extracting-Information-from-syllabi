II. Scope of the Course  
  
This course is designed to present an overview of the development of social
thought from early-day social philosophers to modern social scientists. The
basic ideas of the major social theorists will be presented. Each social
thinker will be evaluated in terms of his contribution to major social
thought, his influence on other sociologists, and the importance of his ideas
in evaluating current social phenomena.  
  
III. Objectives of the Course  

  1. To present the major theoretical contributions of the main social theorists. 
  2. To enable the student to critically evaluate the different theories from his/her own frame of reference. 
  3. To evaluate current social phenomena and social processes in the framework of sociological theories. 
  4. To develop an awareness in the student of differing interpretations of the same social phenomena and processes. 
  5. To enable the student to summarize, contrast, and compare the basic ideas of the major social theorists. 
IV. Required Texts  
     Classical Sociological Theory by George Ritzer  
     McGraw-Hill,1992.   
  
V. Assigned Reading and Research  
  
A term paper (on an agreed upon topic) is required to be turned in on the last
regular class meeting. Each student will be responsible for giving reports on
their internet topics during the semester.  
  
VI. Special Projects and/or Activities  
  
Several mini-projects on the internet will be assigned during the semester.  
  
VII. Method of Instruction  
  
The basic method of instruction will be class lecture-discussion and class
discussion of internet projects.  
  
VIII. Method of Evaluation  

  1. There shall be four tests during the semester (three major tests and a final examination).  

  2. Each test shall count one fifth of the total grade.   

  3. The term papers and internet reports will count one-fifth of the total grade and shall be graded as follows:  
Excellent| 95 | Very Good| 90 | Good| 80 | Fair| 70 | Poor| 60  
---|---  
  

  4. Each test may include the following types of testing: 
    1. Discussion questions 
    2. Short answer-type questions 
    3. Blanks to be filled in 
    4. Multiple-choice
  5. Each test will be constructed to make a maximum of 100 points possible (each test will be given a grade ranging from 0 to 100).   
The four tests (4/5 of final grade) and the term paper and internet reports
(1/5 of final grade) will be averaged at the end of the semester and
translated into Union's letter grades as follows:  
  
95-100 points| A | 85-94 points| B | 75-84 points| C | 65-74 points| D | Under
65 points| F  
---|---  
  

  6. Additionally, "pop" tests may be given during the semester if it appears the assigned materials are not being covered. These tests will be averaged into the final grade.   

  7. Policy on Academic Dishonesty and Cheating  
Academic dishonesty and cheating is contrary to the spirit of Christian
education. Students should not present work for course requirements that is
not original and documented by accepted standards. Cheating will result in an
"F" for the assignment and a report of the incident filed with the Vice-
President of Academic Affairs. Students should consult the university catalog
for a policy statement.  

  8. If the student misses a test(s), the test(s) shall be made up on the last regularly scheduled class day (except for Summer terms). There shall be NO make-up of a make-up test.   
Final tests shall be given only at the designated time. Any changes must be in
writing approved by either (a) the President or (b) the Academic Vice-
President before I will consider approving it.  
  
VIII. Attendance Policy  
  
Each time the student is not in class, he/she is marked "absent." Each absence
(for whatever reasons) above four in a TTH class or six in a MWF class must be
made up by writing a two page double-spaced typewritten paper with at least
two sources other than the textbook on a subject assigned by the professor.
This paper will be related to the work missed during the absence(s). For
Summer terms, absenses above two (2) must be made up. The papers are due no
later than the last regular day the class meets. Two points shall be
subtracted from the final grade point average for each paper not turned in.
Anyone missing more than 25% of the semester shall automatically receive an
"F" for the course.

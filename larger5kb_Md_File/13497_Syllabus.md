### **Contributions of Freud to Personality Theory**

  * **First comprehensive theory of personality**
  * **Responsible for "discovering" the unconscious**
  * **Developed the idea of defense mechanisms**

**_Defense Mechanisms_**

**Disguising threatening impulses and keeping them from reaching
consciousness.**

**The ego is protected against unconscious babbles (anxiety)**

**_Examples:_**

  * **_repression_ : underlies all others. Banishes anxiety arousing thoughts, feelings, and memories form consciousness.**
  * **_regression_ : retreating to more infantile state.**
  * **projection: disguising threatening impulses by attributing them to others.**
  * **_displacement_ : directs sexual and aggressive impulses toward an object more acceptable than the one that aroused. **
  * **_rationalization_ : generate self-justifying explanation so we can hide from ourselves the real reasons for our actions. **



  * **Oedipal complex, penis envy, etc.**

### **Trait Theories**

**Explain differences between people in terms of stable personality traits**

**Modern day psychologists have found 5 personality dimensions that span
cultures**

**_The 5 Factor Theory  (Big 5)_**

**_Extraversion_ : sociable, talkative, active, bold, fun-loving,
enthusiastic, person-centered.**

**_Neuroticism_ : AKA emotional stability. Relaxed, peaceful, objective, calm,
unemotional, even-tempered, secure, patient, uninhibited. **

**_Conscientiousness:_ practical, cautious, serious, reliable, organized,
careful.**

**_Agreeableness:_ warm, generous, trustful, courteous, agreeable, flexible,
forgiving.**

**_Openness to Experience_ : AKA culture, intellect. Original, imaginative,
creative, perceptive, sophisticated, knowledgeable, cultured, artistic,
curious, analytical, liberal.**

  * **Helpful in predicting general trends in behavior**
  * **Too general to predict behavior in a specific situation**

**_Behaviorist Theory_**

  * **Behavior determined by**
    * **reward**
    * **punishment**
    * **conditioning**

**_Social Cognitive Theory_**

  * **Bandura's Reciprocal Determinism and Self-Efficacy**
  * **Rotter's Locus of Control**
  * **_Reciprocal Determinism_ : Personality is determined by continual interaction of cognitive, environmental, and behavioral factors. All 3 are interdependent and interactive.**
  * **_Self-Efficacy_ : One's perception of personal effectiveness; subjective belief that one can successfully perform a behavior to achieve a specific outcome. Influences the amount of persistence/vigor one displays when confronted with a difficulty or an obstacle. **
  * **_Locus of Control_**

**_external_ : belief that you do not control your fate.**

**_internal_ : belief that you are in full control of your fate.**

### **Personality & Heredity**

  * **Heritability can be calculated by comparing traits of twins reared together and twins reared apart**

**_Heritability of Big 5 Traits_**

    * **About 41% of Big 5 traits are attributed to heritability.**
    * **About 52% attributed to non-shared environment, error**
    * **About 7% attributed to shared environment**

**_Assessment_**

    * **Observation**
    * **Interviews**
    * **Rating Scales**
    * **Inventories**
    * **Projective Tests**
    * **Problems**

**Observations, interviews, & rating scales suffer from reliability problems &
the halo effect**

**_Halo Effect_ : Assuming that someone with one favorable trait has many
others as well**

**_Response bias_ : tendency to fake good or bad (avoid military, child
custody, job application, criminal defense).**

**Most people respond in a manner consistent with social desirability.**

### **The MMPI-2**

  * **The most widely-used personality inventory**

**Consists of 567 true-false questions**

**_MMPI-2: Clinical Scales_**

    * **_Hypochondriasis_ (Hs): Exaggerated concern about physical health**
    * **_Depression_ (D): Distress, depression**
    * **_Hysteria_ (Hy): Physical symptoms w/ no cause**
    * **_Psychopathic Deviate_ (Pd): Disregard for moral & social standards**
    * **_Masculinity-Femininity_ (Mf): Having traditional male or female traits**
    * **_Paranoia_ (Pa): Fear of others & suspiciousness **
    * **_Psychasthenia (_ Pt): Rigidity, tension, worry**
    * **_Schizophrenia_ (Sc): bizarre & unusual thinking**
    * **_Hypomania_ (Ma): Excitability, impulsiveness**
    * **_Social Introversion_ (S): Modesty, Shyness**

**_MMPI-2: Validity Scales_**

    * **Cannot Say (?): Evasiveness**
    * **Lying (L): Lying in order to look good**
    * **Infrequency (F): Lying in order to look bad**
    * **Correction (K): Defensiveness in filling out the scale**

### **The California Personality Inventory**

  * **An MMPI-like test designed for normal individuals**

**The MMPI is more useful for clinical purposes, the CPI for normal
populations**

### **Projective Tests**

  * **_The Rorschach_**
  * **Client tells what each blot looks like and what aspect of the blot triggered that response**
  * **Responses scored on use of parts vs. wholes, movement, content, use of color**
  * **Criticized for lack of reliability, low validity (inability to predict behavior)**

### **The Thematic Apperception Test (TAT)**

  * **Consists of 19 vague or ambiguous drawings**

**Person describes what is happening in each**

### **Sentence Completion Test**

  * **A projective test requiring completion of open-ended sentences**

**May be more reliable than the TAT**

### **Magazine Quizzes**

  * **_Personality_ tests in popular magazines often use vague terms and rely on the the "Barnum Effect" **

**"Always have a little something for everybody."**

**(Famed circus owner P.T. Barnum)**

**In this case involves having everyone's assessment be vague (so it fits) but
positive (so you'll believe it)**

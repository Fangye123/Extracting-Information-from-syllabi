**_Course Description_**

 This course provides an overview of the history of the U.S. West and
introduces students to a vibrant region vested with national significance as
the "frontier" has been a defining paradigm for American identity, culture,
and politics. Although the course will span from the sixteenth century to the
present, the focus will rest on the U.S. West since the Gold Rush. Major
themes will include the role of the federal government, the environment,
migration and settlement, economic development, and myth & history.

**Mellon Technology/Image Project**

We are privileged to have working with us this semester, James Griffith, a CGU
graduate student, who will be the teaching assistant for the course. He will
oversee the incorporation of computer technology into the class. Much of this
work is still in progress, but students will, for example, use WebCrossing as
part of their team presentations. James will hold office hours on Tuesdays and
Wednesdays 10 - 11am and Thursdays 2:30 - 4:30pm and by appointment. He can be
reached via email at: james.griffith@cgu.edu  


**Short Papers**

These papers are based on the readings for the given week and serve two main
purposes. The first is to foster critical reading and thinking about the
subject matter. The second objective is to use these assignments to work on
writing skills, both in and outside of class. In general, a question will be
posed in the week prior to the reading that will be the basis for the short
paper. The papers are to be typed, double-spaced, stapled, and not exceed two
(2) pages in length.



**IMPT!** Short papers are due on Thursdays, by 10:00 am in Pitzer Hall, Rm 6
(x78026). Ask Aimee Mason or one of the other staff to place the short paper
in my mailbox. Late papers will NOT be accepted. _You must bring a second copy
of the paper to class since there will be an in-class component to the
assignment._



**Team Presentations**

This exercise is intended to foster working effectively together in teams --
an important skill not often honed since so much emphasis is placed upon
individual performance. Successful presentations will work to involve students
in lively discussion. The first step will require posting a focus question on
the Web and overseeing the discussion. Teams will work with the teaching
assistant for the course on this facet of the assignment. The aim is to post
one question that will get the discussion of the reading started. Responses on
the Web should be limited to a half page.

Each team will then to pose follow-up questions in class and be responsible
for leading discussion, fielding questions, and helping the class to think and
to talk about the issues raised in the reading and in the Web discussion.
Teams may use a variety of teaching tools such as handouts, video clips, role-
playing, etc. Be creative, but focus on major themes.  
** **  
**DO NOT** simply summarize the reading ... assume that the rest of the class
has done the reading and it is fair game to call on students. Total time for
the presentation is about thirty-five (35) minutes.

Each team member must fill out an evaluation form (see last page) that will be
used as part of the evaluation process. Turn in the evaluation form within one
week after the presentation.  


**Research Paper**

All students should discuss their paper topics with the instructor. While
there is flexibility in terms of the type of project, in the past, students
have done well on the following kinds of papers: biography, an examination of
a discrete historical event (e.g., 1906 San Francisco earthquake), and
community studies (broadly defined). The papers should rely on critical
readings of secondary sources and make every effort to also incorporate
primary source materials as part of the research foundation. It is important
to provide the reader with historical background, but the best papers will
offer an interpretation of the past that moves beyond merely telling what
happened to build a case that explains why events unfolded as they did. A
checklist will be given out to help students with the writing process.

**Start early** : get to the library early on. Most students run into problems
because they start too late. Inter-library loans can take 4-6 weeks and some
books may need to be recalled which can take 2 weeks or longer. In addition,
some topics may seem promising at first, but after initial digging, you may
run into dead ends that require adjusting your research agenda. Discuss your
project with a reference librarian. Adam Rosenkranz, reference librarian and
bibliographer for history at Honnold, may point out sources that you are
unaware of. Set-up an appointment with him at the Reference Desk.

**Revise, Revise, Revise** : start writing early, since the process itself
will clarify and sharpen your ideas and also clarify how you will need to
guide further research. Most students wait far too long to begin writing and
as a result, they do not have sufficient time to revise their papers.



**Individual Presentations**

Each presenter will present for approximately ten (10) minutes. Because time
is short, you will need to plan well and the evaluation of your presentation
will be based upon how effectively you use your time in giving the class a
clear and concise overview of your research. Be sure to allow a few minutes
for questions, and it is your responsibility to manage the allotted time.

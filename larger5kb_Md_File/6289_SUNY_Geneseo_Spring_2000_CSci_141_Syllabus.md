##  Books and Other Resources

###  Text:

There are two (2) required texts for this course.

1.  The first is pre-publication sections of a book by Baldwin and Scragg, _Introduction to the Science of Computing._ As we are using this prior to publication, it is only available as bound copies, and only from Sundance Books.   
2.  The second required text for this course is a text by Kenneth  A. Lambert and Martin Osborne, _JAVA_ , _A Framework for Programmingand Problem Solving._   Brooks/Cole, 2000.  isbn 0 534 95116 3.

###  Programming Environment:

With one exception, Object Pascal was the programming language used for
implementation of labs and homework in CSci 141 until this current semester.
This semester, we will use the JAVA programming language to implement labs and
homework assignments.  Please do understand that this is the first semester
with this new JAVA programming environment for the course.  Your patience,
your understanding that change is not always smooth, and your willingness to
be flexible is appreciated as we work through the conversion with a large
number of students to using a different programming language.

##  Grading:

Your grade for this course will be calculated from your grades on
labs,quizzes, exams, homework assignments, etc. as follows:  
  Labs: | 15%  
---|---  
Quizzes & Homework: | 20%  
Hour Exams(2): | 20% each  
Final: | 25%  
  
###  Exam Schedule:

The following dates are best estimates. They may well change as students'
actual needs become apparent. Refer to the Web version of this syllabus for
the most current information, I will keep the web version current.  
  Oct  5 | First Hour Exam  
---|---  
Nov 9 | Second Hour Exam  
Dec 19 | Final Exam at noon:classroom  
  
###  **Labs, Homework Assignments and Quizzes:**

You will attend lab once each week, and for each lab, you will be required to
turn in something for grading. Each lab will contain a due date and a
description of what is to be handed in for that lab.  For most of the labs
this simply means a print-out of the work you did in the lab.  See the
Documentation Requirements which must be followed to receive perfect scores
for submissions.  For a few of the labs, you will be required to turn in a one
to two-page written lab report.

Homework assignments will contain a due date and a description of the work to
be submitted.  Quizzes will be announced one-week prior to administration
during lecture.  It is your responsibility to get the notes, announcements,
and assignments from classmates whenever you miss class or lab; absence is not
an excuse for late homework or for not knowing that a quiz would be given.
The quiz will be administered in class to those present only; if you are not
present, you will not have an opportunity to make up the quiz.  Instead, you
will need to take advantage of the extra-credit opportunity provided in
November to replace up to 70% of the points from missed quiz(zes).  Perfect
scores for the quiz portion of your course grade are possible only if you are
present for all quizzes.  If you were present for all quizzes, you may use the
extra-credit opportunity to raise a maximum of 100% your quiz grade(s).

###  Late Policy

Late work is accepted, but there is a 10% per day penalty for each day late,
including weekends.  You are encouraged to finish the assignments during lab
or on the day following lab so that it can be handed in without penalty by a
classmate by the date due, even if you do become ill.  The late penalty
assumes this schedule of completion so the 10% penalty per day is taken on all
late papers, no matter the reason for the tardiness.

##  Policy on Collaboration

Assignments in this course are meant to be learning exercises. You are
therefore welcome to work on them in small groups so that you can benefit
from mistakes and successes of others, from differences in ideas and thinking,
and from having to communicate your thoughts clearly to others.  I recommend a
group size of two.  If the groups are larger than two, the intellectual
contribution points get distributed among more people making the grades lower
for the team members.  If you work alone, you have no one to discuss ideas
with, and as the semester progresses you will find working alone can be a
distinct disadvantage.

If more than one of you worked on a project, you need to carefully document
the components and ideas that each of you individually supplied to the
finished work.   This is a critical component of the grading for the work
submitted.  You need to document what you originated (ideas, partial
algorithms, programming, error fixing, etc.) as well as that which other
members of your group contributed.  In this way, you MUST acknowledge any work
that you hand in that is not your own.  Not documenting that an idea was given
to you by another person constitutes plagiarism of their idea.   Sharing ideas
and learning is encouraged.  Not giving credit when you use another person's
idea/work/fix/etc. is stealing.  The labs and homeworks are meant to exact
intellectual contributions from ALL students.  If you find you are not doing
your share, you may wish to start the assignments/labs early; this way you
will have already an investment in the intellectual ideas of the assignment.

Please note that tests are tests of what you know, and working together on
them is explicitly forbidden. This means that if you take advantage of the
collaboration policy to avoid doing your share of the work on the homework,
you will probably discover too late that you haven't learned enough to do very
well on the tests.

Note that I will penalize violations of this policy. The severity of the
penalty will depend on the severity of the violation.

###  Reading Assignment Schedule:

Read chapters one and two of BOTH texts by Tuesday of the second week (9/5).
Read the next chapter in sequence of Baldwin and Scragg's text by Tuesday of
each week.  The Baldwin and Scragg text serves as the main text, while the
Lambert and Osborne text supplies the programming examples and details that
you will need to do the programming projects and to understand the nuances of
the Java programming language.  Read through the next chapter in sequence of
Lambert and Osborne's text by Tuesday of each week, being sure you understand
the programming components therein so that you can use in the week's lab.  The
lectures will provide the fundamental ideas needed for the projects, and the
L&O text will give examples which show the correct programming syntax in java
needed to write programs to implement the ideas.  The sequence and content of
topics for the course follows those presented in the text by Baldwin and
Scragg.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
This course is designed to provide an historical perspective through a general
survey of Western Civilization, beginning with the rise of Modern Europe in
the mid-17th century and ending in mid-twentieth century. Key topics in this
course will include the Scientific Revolution, the Enlightenment, the Age of
Revolutions, Industrialism, and modern warfare.

**COURSE PURPOSE**  
The primary purpose of this course is that through an analysis of the origins
of the Western world from the historical perspective, students may begin to
nurture within themselves an awareness of the historical context of the
civilization, which lies at the base of contemporary western society. Through
this introduction to the discipline of History, students will gain skills
valuable in a broad-based liberal arts education, particularly in terms of
increased skill in analyzing information and expressing the results of that
analysis in clear, meaningful prose.

**REQUIRED READINGS** (available in the bookstore)  
Jackson Spielvogel, _Western Civilization: A Brief History_ Vol. II (Boston:
West/Wadsworth, 1999)  
Voltaire, _Candide_ (New York: Bantam Books, 1959)  
Elie Wiesel, _Night_ (New York: Bantam Books, 1960)

**A BOLD NEW WORLD**  
We will be embarking on an adventure this semester.  As part of a federal
grant, this class is part of an experiment on the introduction of electronic
technologies into the classroom.  The grant is designed to create within pre-
service teachers an expectation that technology has a place in the modern
classroom.  To accomplish this, the grant is designed to help professors use
technology as often as is both possible, and educationally legitimate.  One
element of this effort will be a survey that this class will complete, which
will help the grant team judge the average amount of computer proficiency of
MSU-B students.

**TEACHING APPROACH AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS**  
By the comprehensive nature of this course, it will require a significant
amount of work by both the instructor and the students.  But the pay-off for
those efforts is great. To insure that the broadened perspective which we will
gain from this class is as complete as possible, it is absolutely essential
that students do all of the assigned reading. The schedule of reading
assignments is designed so that readings are to be completed before the class
period indicated. This will provide the students with a common knowledge base
from which the daily lectures and discussions will arise.

_Analytical Review:_  
During the course of the semester, we will be reading three books.  To assist
you in preparing for classroom discussions of these important texts, we will
be writing a brief (3 full pages) review of your choice of either Candide or
Night.  This review will not merely summarize one of the books, but it will
examine the meaning of the book, and place it within the context of the larger
events we examine in class.  The review will be due on or before Friday, April
20, **_WITH NO EXCEPTIONS._**

Exams:  
In the course of the semester, we will have one group/individual midterm exam,
several weekly (or bi-weekly) quizzes, and a final.  The midterm will be taken
in class, during a regularly scheduled class time.  It will consist of ID's,
in which the student will identify key individuals/ events/theories and state
their historical significance, and essays.  We will discuss effective essay-
writing strategies more as the exam nears.

Exam Dates:  
Midterm Exam:  Monday, MArch 5  
Final Exam:   Monday, April 30, 12:00-1:50 PM

Make-up Examinations:  
A make-up midterm examination will be available only to those whose absence is
excused (illness or death), and who notify me before the exam day and time.
If you must miss an exam, you need to call either my office, or leave a
message with the departmental secretary (telephone: 657-2119).  All make-up
exams must be completed within one week of the scheduled examination period.
Make-ups for the weekly quizzes will not be offered.

**NOTE: COMPLETION OF ALL ASSIGNMENTS ON TIME IS NECESSARY IN THIS COURSE.
ASSIGNMENTS SUBMITTED LATE, EXCEPT FOR SITUATIONS OF EXTREME HARDSHIP, WILL
NOT BE ACCEPTED.**

Attendance:  
There is a clear correlation between regular and punctual attendance in class
and academic success.  In recognition of this correlation, all students will
be expected and required to attend all class meetings and examinations. Please
note that not all of the material for which students will be responsible can
be found in the texts. Within the context of this expectation of regular
attendance, the attendance policy for this class will be as follows: for every
unexcused absence beyond the three tolerated by the instructor, the student's
final grade will be penalized 3%. In addition, since entering class after the
class has begun is disruptive for all parties, habitual late arrival to class
will be reflected in the final grade.

Grade Percentages:  
Quizzes:   20% (total)  
Book Review:  20%  
Midterm Exam:  25%  
Final:    35%

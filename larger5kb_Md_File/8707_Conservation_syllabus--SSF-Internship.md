# Syllabus

**Description**

     The internship provides the opportunity for students to observe and experience, at first hand, the operations and activities of a conservation practice and preservation management in the public or private sectors. The fifteen week full time block placement is designed to integrate theory and practice as well as introduce new techniques, methods, approaches and equipment beyond the scope of the Fleming programme. The internship can be developed as a specialized and focused reaming opportunity or a more general placement in preventive conservation and preservation management. Projects are planned and directed with faculty support and implemented under the supervision of a qualified practicing conservator or preservation manager.
      

**Aim & Leaming Outcomes**

    

**Aim:**

     To enable students to integrate theory and practice under the direction of a qualified conservator in a working environment.
**Learning Outcomes:**

    

Students will have demonstrated the ability to:

    plan and implement a work programme which builds on competencies developed in the core curriculum;
    develop a personal learning contract and write goals and objectives;
    demonstrate an acceptable level of perfommance in the specific work activities/outcomes defined in their contract;
    develop skills and techniques based on the specialization, resources and equipment available;
    observe and become familiar with methods, equipment, and specialization not available in the college setting;
    integrate theory and practice while understanding the limitations of theoretical models;
    within the day to day operations of the organkation, observe, participate in, or take responsibility for, assigned tasks and activities;
    assess existing strengths and weaknesses through self assessment and site assessment;
    understand the issues and complexities surrounding ethical practice, public accountability and stewardship of collections and make appropriate judgement calls;
    network with conservators and other personnel of the host institution, thereby, developing contacts in the profession while becoming familiar with different types of training and expertise.
    find their own level of competence and preferred areas of specialization treatments, activities and/or projects under the direction of their supervisor
    earn a reputation from a recognized institution
    assess existing strengths and weaknesses through self assessment and the site's assessment
    plan, research and complete a research paper on a special topic;
      

**Course Format**

     Students are placed with an approved institution of their choice for a full-time (fifteen week) block placement. In some circumstances a split placement between different sites and/or departments may be arranged. Planning and discussion periods will be scheduled as required.
    The student works under the direction of the host institution on activities, projects, and artifact treatments which serve to benefit both parties mutually.
    The success of the internship is dependent on the co-operation and collaboration of the three partners: the intern, the college and the site.
      

**Intern Responsibilities**

     The intern is accountable for the following: 

    confirming start and finish dates with faculty and the site supervisor and notifying them of any changes;
    conforming to the site work week and hours of operation and responding to special needs as required;
    developing a reaming contract and work plan in co-operation with the host site and college faculty and forwarding this for approval to the college; consulting with college faculty on work status and progress, on a regular basis; adhering to recognised codes of ethics;
    producing work to the highest possible standard of a quality acceptable to the site and supervisor;
    demonstrating a lively and professional interest in the site and the operations of the institution;
    carrying out responsibilities with goodwill and a positive attitude;
    seeking guidance, as required; ask If in doubt
    accepting feedback gracefully, even though it may not always be positive;
    discussing any perceived work-related problems with the site co- ordinator and college intern liaison as they may arise;
    being sensitive to the needs and demands placed on the site staff and using their time appropriately;
    adhering to site policies and procedures; and specifically:
    using health and safety clothing and equipment, if required;
    complying with site health and safety regulations;
    reporting any accidents which require medical attention to the college within 24 hours.
    maintaining a journal which briefly documents the high points and low pints of placement activity, (eg. activities, responsibilities, challenges and resolutions). The journal should be a vehicle for self-assessment and a record of existing strengths and weaknesses in terms of skills and knowledge base.
    Journal entries must be submitted every two weeks or more frequently if preferred. The journals are the primary means of the intern liaison understanding the content, pacing and progress of the internship. They must be submitted in order to receive a passing grade from the course. Journal entries may be e-mailed or faxed as well as mailed.
    writing a letter of thanks to the site and site supervisor(s) at the end of the internship. Please c.c. your supervisor's superior and file a copy with the intern liaison.
      

**Site Responsibilities**

     The site is responsible for
    

    appointing a supervisor to whom the students reports and is directly accountable;
    developing a learning contract/work plan with the intern;
    maintaining a liaison with the college;
    providing the intern with clear guidance and direction, as required;
    providing the student with appropriate, honest and frequent feedback;
    ensuring the students's time is used appropriately and well; being responsive to students needs and abilities;

**Evaluation**

     1\. SITE SUPERVISOR'S ASSESSMENT: 30% of total grade (based on a mid-semester and final assessment, each assessment worth 15%) ~ The site supervisor will be asked to provide verbal feedback on the student's work and performance periodically during the placement. In addition, the supervisor is requested to complete a written assessment of the student at the completion of the placement. Detailed criteria for assessment and forms will be provided by the college. The assessment will be based on the extent to which the student has furfilled the responsibilities described in the course outline as well as the level of satisfaction with the specific outcomes of the learning contract. 

2\. COLLEGE INTERN LIAISON: 10% of total grade (based on activity throughout
the placement and awarded at the end of the semester)

Faculty are responsible for interpreting and assessing student performance at
the site. Criteria for assessment include the extent to which the student has
met the responsibilities described in the outline as well as the outcomes of
the learning contract. Faculty will work with site supervisors in assessing
the student level of performance. In order to ensure that faculty have enough
information to work with, students should ensure that they sustain regular
contact. Calls can be resumed at the college's expense if there is a problem
with costs at the site.

3\. LEARNING CONTRACT: 10% of final grade  
Due Week 2 or 3. See the internship manual for details.

4\. STUDENT FINAL REPORT: 10% (due promptly end of week 15)

This final report is designed to assist students in subsequent years to select
and develop a field placement. The report could take a number of forms, but
must include:

    name of site
    a brief description of site and scope of activity
    a copy of the reaming contract and work plan
    your assessment of the placement - in partcular, areas in which you might have been better prepared; high points, low points; the type of student who might best suite the placement; etc.

The final report should be a maximum of two-three pages in length, with work
plans and:

  * Any other materials which may assist the college supervisor gaining an understanding of the placement context, eg. institutional mission, policy and procedures;
  * A record of absences, if any, from the placement as well as additional activity.

5\. RESEARCH PROPOSAL: 10% of total grade, due week 4 (A proposal must be
submitted and approved by the Intem Liaison before proceeding with the actual
research project/report. See details below.)

6\. STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECT REPORT: 30% of total grade (proposal is due at
the end of week 4, and completed reports must be submitted by the end of week
13 at the latest, to ensure adequate marking time.)

Detailed guidelines for the project are included in the Internship Manual.
Please refer to these for the information on the specific format, expectations
and criteria for assessment. following:

  * identification of an area of special interest already included in the learning contract
  * selecting one aspect of the above, developing a focus and establishing a manageable activity/project of use to the site and which provides a vehicle for additional research and original thinking
  * some additional research activity beyond that which is site based (eg. this may take the form of telephone interviews, observation, site visits, Intemet/literature searches, comparative study, etc)
  * documentation of all aspects the project/activity including methodology, results, recommendations, etc

This project should not put any extraordinary pressure on the student or the
host site. Students are encouraged to approach the paper as a vehicle for
presentation or publication. Students must consult with sites regarding
copyright and disclosure of informa ion. Faculty recognise that some sites may
have better libraries and resources than others, thus fitting the project to
the resources available is key to success.

Final reports will be filed in the college. Please submit two copies of the
paper to the college, one for comments and one for the programme to keep on
file. A third copy must be filed with the site. As late in the semester is a
very busy time in the academic year, papers must be submitted on time. This
means the scope of your activity should be manageable within the 15 week time
frame. Students should keep a fourth copy for their own portfolio.

for assessment are provided in the Internship Manual.

**Course Policy**

     I. Students must be registered in the field practice course before going to their placements in order to be covered by the college liability, WCB or accident insurance.
    II. Placements may, in extraordinary circumstances, be terminated for a number of reasons. These include: 

  1. Non-compliance with assigned tasks, duties and responsibilities as determined and documented by the Site Supervisor in conjunction with college representatives.
  2. Consistently poor performance with respect to assigned tasks, duties and responsibilities as determined and documented by the site supervisor.
  3. tardiness or absenteeism from the site as determined and documented by the site supervisor.
  4. of Intemship policies and procedures as determined and documented by faculty supervisors.
  5. and unprofessional behaviour in dealings with the collection, staff or public, as determined and documented by faculty.
  6. intern setting as determined and documented by the intern and faculty support and in conjunction with the Site Supervisor.

Due process for termination is available in the manual.

**III. Absenteeism Policy**

     The student will be expected to conform to the regular working hours and vacation schedule of the host institution.
    A good attendance record is an integral part of the internship experience. However, it is also understood that students may need to be absent from their placements for reasons of accident, illness or family emergency. The following policy applies: 

  1. In the instance of students on full-time intemships, they may be absent for a maximum of five days per semester without having to compensate for loss of time. Students are required to notify supervisors of impending absence as soon as is reasonably possible. (It is, however, also recognized that intern projects require the full-time allotment for satisfactory completion.)
  2. In cases where a student requires leave for more than this amount of time, the situation will be discussed with site and faculty supervisors. In some cases it will be expected that students be required to make up the time.
  3. Students are required to maintain a record of all absences. 

A student Code of Conduct will be provided in addition to the information
listed above. (Refer to CCM Internship Manual section on policies and Appendix
A)

  4. There are some minor variances in student start and completion dates. Despite this variation, all students should conform to the due dates as stated, which allow for adequate preparation and completion of assignments.

**Late Assignments**

     As part of the Centre for Community Development and Health, the CCM program will implement the centre policy on late assignments. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day for three days, after which a grade of zero will be given. All assignments must be submitted in order for students to achieve a passing grade. Faculty are not obligated to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero.
    It is the student's responsibility to contact College faculty well in advance if difficulties arise.
      

**Prerequisite:** Successful completion of all in-house course work.

      

**Academic Policies**

    

**1\. Presentation**

     Written assignments must be: 

    typed or word-processed
    double spaced
    proofed for spelling and grammatical errors
    enclosed with a single cover sheet which includes student name, title of the assignment and date of submission
    stapled in the top left hand corner (unbound)
    include a bibliography (where appropriate)
    use a recognized method of citation (eg. MLA or Chicago)
**2\. Rewrites**

     Faculty may request a re-write of a submission if the criteria for assessment have not been met. Late penalties will apply if the assignment is not re-submitted the following day.
**3\. Penalties for Late Submissions**

    

Completion of Term Work

    All assignments must be completed in order for students to achieve a passing grade.
Late Assignments

    Late assignments receive the following penalty: 

    Marks will be deducted at the rate of 10% per day for three days after which assignments are marked at zero.
    Faculty are not obliged to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero. Oral Presentations
    Oral presentations and/or practical test or projects for evaluation must be delivered on the day scheduled. A "no show" will be graded at zero, unless adequate explanation is provided.
**4\. Academic Integrity**

     Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity and the college has a strict policy on this issue (see Academic Regulations). 

    It is a student's responsibility to ensure that all written submissions include an appropriate method of in text citation as well as an accompanying bibliography.
    Seminar and oral presentations should be supported by a bibliography and sources should be referred to during the presentation.
**5\. Make-up Tests**

     In valid circumstances (ill-health, personal crisis), a student may be given a make-up test to compensate for one missed in class-time. Students must contact the instructor within seven days of the original test in order to request a make-up.
**6\. Extensions & GDFS**

    An extension may be granted to an individual student based on need and circumstance. Medical grounds should be substantiated.
    The revised due date will be recorded and signed by both parties.
    The entire class may be given an extension, at the discretion of faculty.
    Incomplete a Grade Deferred marks at the end of the semester must be negotiated between student and faculty (see Academic Regulations). Note: these are a privilege to be granted under special circumstances, not used in order to compensate for poor planning.
**7\. Site Work**

     Students must agree to work within the parameters of the guidelines established for site work. Failure to comply, may result in the termination of project and suspension of the privilege of access.

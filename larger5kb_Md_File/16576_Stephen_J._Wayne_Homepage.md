**Spring 2002:  
** _GOVT 255 American Presidency_ ([Syllabus](govt255S02.wpd))  
The constitutional and political foundations of the presidency in the American
system of government. The nature and scope of executive leadership in domestic
and foreign affairs as well as the interaction of the presidency with other
major political institutions. Special consideration is also given to the
development and functioning of the presidential office. Prerequisite: 143-008.

GOVT 702 Research in American Politics ([Syllabus](govt702S02.pdf))  
This course is designed as a graduate research seminar. Its goal is to provide
a supportive environment in which students can design and conduct empirical
research on an aspect of American politics and government. A subsidiary goal
is to aid students in critiquing the work of others. Collectively the class
will critique each other's research as it moves from conception to execution
to completion. On-going research, to be discussed in class, should be
presented in written form as indicated in the syllabus below. All papers
should be distributed to every member of the seminar in his/her mail box in
the department no later than 10am on the Monday morning preceding the
afternoon class. The ultimate objective of the course is to complete a paper
that will make a contribution to our knowledge of American politics and
government and/or the methodology of studying it, a paper that can be
presented at a professional meeting and published in a professional journal.
Students may also wish to use the course to engage in research that might
culminate in a doctoral dissertation.

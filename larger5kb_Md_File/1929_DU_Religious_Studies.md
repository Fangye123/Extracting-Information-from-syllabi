_**COURSE DESCRIPTION**_ : Religions in all societies have ambiguous
relationships to systems of discrimination and oppression. This course will
explore some of those dynamics in the history of the United States in dialogue
with contemporary critical race theory, and in one comparative unit on the
struggle against racism in South Africa. We will explore recourses for active
anti-racism, both as an internal process and self-reflection about how race is
part of socialization in US society and as an analysis of institutions and
movements which consciously promote liberation from and healing of racism.

_**UNITS OF THE COURSE**_ : As orientation to the class we will open with a
consideration of the terrorist event in Birmingham, AL on September 15, 1963
as depicted in Spike Lee's movie, "Four Little Girls,"after which the seminar
will read Gravely's essay, "Race, Truth and Reconciliation in the US:
Reflections on Desmond Tutu's Proposal," published in the internet JOURNAL OF
RELIGION AND SOCIETY (vol. 3, 2001, 1-21) and Martin Luther King Jr's "I Have
Dream" speech in August 1963 followed by the funeral sermon for the victims of
that church bombing less than a year later. Also will read Sartre's essay on
Anti-Semitism, except from George Kelsey RACISM AND THE CHRISTIAN
UNDERSTANDING OF MAN.

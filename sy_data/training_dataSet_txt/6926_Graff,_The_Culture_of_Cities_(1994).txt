   Graff, The Culture of Cities (1994)                     Â         The Culture of Cities (HUHI 7370) Harvey J. Graff University of Texas Dallas, Texas, USA Fall 1994      In seminar format, this course offers a collective exploration of the bases, dimensions, and processes that underlay the development of what we too easily term "modern culture" whether in the U.S. or the West more generally. Specifically, we consider the transformation of urban space and place during the epochal era from the late eighteenth through the mid-to late-twentieth centuries. In the process, we critically probe the meanings of both "urban" and "culture" in concrete social and political economic contexts, evaluating alternative formulations and relationships as we search for anintegrating understanding. Among the elements of the complex historical interaction we seek to understand are: social class, gender, ethnicity and race, geographic space and sociocultural space, accumulation and display, architecture, institutions, cultural hierarchies (in actuality and symbolically) and relationships, cultural politics and political economics. Among our organizing questions are those that surround notions of mass or class cultures, integration vs. fragmentation, separate spheres, private vs. public spaces, commercial cultures, control vs. freedom, and the futures of both culture and cities. Our realm is the historical; our questions, tools, and theories are interdisciplinary; the boundaries to the inquiry are those we set together in search of "urban culture".Requirements:Regular reading, attendance, and participation in seminar; oral reports to the class; seminar paper in consultation with the instructor.Books RequiredThomas Bender, Toward an Urban Vision (Kentucky, 1975, Johns Hopkins UP, 1991)Mary Ryan, Cradle of the Middle Class (Cambridge, 1979)Neil Harris, Cultural Excursions (Chicago, l99O)Kathy Peiss, Cheap Amusements:  Working Women and Leisure in Turn-of-the-Century New York (Temple, 1986)William R.

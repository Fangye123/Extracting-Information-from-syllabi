# Syllabus

**Description**

     This course is designed to teach the student the history of the materials and technology used to create artifacts of wood, and leather and proteinaceous materials. The origin of these organic materials and their fabrication into museum objects will be studied.
      

**Aim & Learning Outcomes**

    

**Aim:**

     To enable the students to understand the history and development of technology and material culture.
      

**Learning Outcomes:**

     Students will have demonstrated the ability to: 

    know the origins, sources, processing, products, manufacture, construction methods, fabrication and design of the materials and objects made of wood, and leather and proteinaceous materials.
    know the origins, history and development of the technologies and manufacturing processes of objects made of wood, and leather and proteinaceous materials.
    research objects, materials and technologies of wood, and leather and proteinaceous materials using a variety of media and methods.
      

**Course Format**

     This course is one of four courses listed in the "super modules of Conservation and Material Science II. Courses in this frame work are linked tightly together, are interdependent to each other, and are foundation courses for the program. 

This course will consist of 1 hour of scheduled lecture per week. Lecture time
may be subject to occasional adjustment in order to fit in with field trips,
community based projects, group projects or guest lectures and/or workshops.
Students are asked to remain flexible during the delivery of this course
content.

Additional time outside of scheduled class will be required for lndependent
study.

**Evaluation**

     The following assignments will be used to evaluate students' mastery of the theoretical aspects of the history of technology and material culture. 

Students must complete all course assignments in order to receive a passing
grade.

      
Item| Value in Percentage| Due Date  
---|---|---  
Mid Term Test, Wood| 30%| February 17, 1998  
End of Term Test, Leather & Proteinaceous Materials| 30%| April 7, 1998  
Sample Kit, Wood, Leather and Proteinaceous Materials| 20%| April 17,1998  
Sample Kit Documentation| 20%| April 17,1998  
      

**1\. Presentation**

     Written assignments must be: 

    typed or word-processed
    double spaced
    proofed for spelling and grammatical errors
    enclosed with a single cover sheet which includes student name, title of the assignment and date of submission
    stapled in the top left hand corner (unbound)
    include a bibliography (where appropriate)
    use a recognized method of citation (eg. MLA or Chicago)
**2\. Re-writes**

     Faculty may request a re-write of a submission if the criteria for assessment have not been met.
    Late penalties will apply if the assignment is not re-submitted the following day.
**3\. Penalties for Late Submissions**

     Completion of Term Work 

    All assignments must be completed in order for students to achieve a passing grade.
**Late Assignments**

     Late assignments receive the following penalty:
    Marks will be deducted at the rate of 10% per day for three days after which assignments are marked at zero.
    Faculty are not obliged to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero.
**Oral Presentations**

     Oral presentations and/or practical test or projects for evaluation must be delivered on the day scheduled. A "no show" will be graded at zero, unless adequate explanation is provided.

**4\. Academic Integrity**

     Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity and the college has a strict policy on this issue (see Academic Regulations).

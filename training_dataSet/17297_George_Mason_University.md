_Overview_

            Products Liability is, with the _possible_ exception of Constitutional Law, the most controversial area of American law.   Products Liability has acquired a life of its own in America - thus this course instead of one rushed week in an already crowded Torts curriculum.  The exploration of Products Liability problems is a stimulating (and at times frustrating...) one.  This is a topical course, but it is a difficult one, too.  Why is it difficult?  Because we're going to get to the bottom of the "crisis" that allegedly plagues Products Liability. 



_Compulsory Texts, Organization of Classes, etc._

            An estimated time allocation for class sessions follows.  Page numbers refer to the casebook (Owen, Montgomery & Keeton, _Products Liability & Safety_, 3d ed., 1996, as modified by the 2000 supplement).[1] Problems are from Lebel _et al_., _Products Liability Problems_.   The monograph is Krauss, _Fire and Smoke:   Government Tort Suits and the Rule of Law_ (1999).  All these should be purchased.

## Evaluation

            _Assuming that twenty-five or fewer students are enrolled in the course_ , there will be no final exam.  The final grade will be accounted for in one of two ways:  you may EITHER prepare a paper (minimum 20 pages, maximum 30 pages) on one products liability issue, and submit it to me at the last class, OR you may submit 5 mini-papers in answer to five of the problems assigned in the readings.  The mini-papers (minimum 4 typed double-spaced pages, maximum 8 pages each) will be graded the way diving competitions are evaluated -- so _do not cavalierly choose easy questions, as these will be much more rigorously graded._ If you choose one of the longer papers, you must sign up by February 1.   I encourage you to consider this latter option.

            In preparing your paper or mini-papers, be as thorough, as creative and (most important of all) as theoretical as interest and available time allow!  Each mini-paper must be handed in before the beginning of the class during which the chapter containing the relevant problem will be discussed. Refer to the schedule above to get an idea of the dates.    [If you are going to miss a particular class, your mini-paper must be faxed to me before the beginning of class.]

            Class attendance is a must.  You must attend 80% of classes to avoid "capital punishment" (or at least, its grading equivalent...).  And you must be prepared for class (i.e., compulsory readings must be done beforehand).  You each may use _one_ "pass", at your discretion, by coming to see me _before_ class begins and asking not to be called on. If I call on you and you are not prepared for class, and have not taken a pass that day, you have in my view committed a serious breach of trust.   This will result in a minus one-notch penalty.  On the other hand, if your comments are frequently very helpful to the discussion, you will receive a one-notch bonus on your final grade.

**Assignments** :

The reading assignments are listed on your "Schedule of Assignments" sheet. Be
sure to read each one in full by Monday of the week for which they are
assigned. Be prepared to discuss the readings in your discussion section.



**Enrollment** :

All students must be officially enrolled in the course by the end of the
second full week of the quarter. No requests to add the course will be
approved by the department chair after that time. Enrolling officially and on
time is solely the responsibility of each student.



**Examinations** :

There will be two midterm examinations and a final exam. All will be primarily
essay in nature. The essay on the final exam will be comprehensive.



**Make-up Exam Policy** :

If for any family or medical reason you find it absolutely necessary to miss
an examination, you must contact your T.A. before the examination and have
his/her consent to your absence if you wish to take a make up exam. The course
instructor will not give permission for make up exams. You must see your T.A.
in order to arrange an appropriate make up time and you must take the make up
at that scheduled time. You must also take the final exam at the scheduled
time. With the exception of extreme emergencies and graduating seniors, no
early or make up finals will be given. If such an emergency should arise, you
must speak with your T.A. to make appropriate arrangements.

**Suggestions to help you in the course** :

First, while attendance will not be taken in lecture, there is a direct
correlation between attendance and success in this class. If you wish to do
well, you need to attend lecture and take good notes. Unfortunately, I cannot
allow my lectures to be recorded. I will not tolerate disruptive behavior such
as reading newspapers and holding private conversations while the class is in
session. Attendance will be taken in your discussion section.

Second, if you do not understand a course requirement or course material,
please ask about it. You will have several opportunities to do this. You can
ask questions at any time during lecture or discussion and the T.A.'s will
hold office hours to assist you. I will also be available to you in my office
during the listed times. If you have questions about exam material, please ask
before the exam!

Third, if you do not understand the grading of your exam, please seek
clarification at the earliest opportunity. Since the T.A.'s will be grading
your work, you must see them first. If, for some reason, they cannot answer
your questions, you must address your concerns to me in writing (1/2 to 1
page). Once I have read your exam and your written comments, I will discuss
your concerns with you.

Fourth, we would like to offer the following suggestion to assist you in
writing essay exams:

  * Always relate exam points to time: If the exam has three sections of equal value, apportion your time equally. DO NOT spend longer on one or two of the sections than the percent of the grade justifies.
  * Outline your essay before beginning to write. If you do not outline, the result often is a confused answer. So outline quickly. Then begin writing a properly composed essay; write an introduction; compose the main portion of the answer; conclude with two or three sentences that summarize your argument. If you follow this procedure, rather than simply writing your essay as the thoughts occur to you, you are more apt to write an organized, coherent essay. DO NOT WORRY ABOUT LENGTH! ! ! Just make sure you cover the subject and answer every part of the question.
  * Remember that the prime concern of history is to analyze change or changes through a period of time. When, why, and how the changes occurred and the significance of the changes to American history are concerns at the center of each question you will be asked. As you study along throughout the quarter, try to use this framework as you read the assigned material and review your notes. When exam time comes, you then will be thinking along the right lines.

I. COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course introduces the general nature of philosophical thought, and its 
  basic methods and goals. The material covered includes selections by both current 
  and historically important philosophers (e.g., Plato, Descartes, Hume, Russell, 
  Perry, Nagel) on such classic philosophical topics as the existence of God, 
  the nature of right and wrong, and the possibility of knowledge. Through 
  our readings and discussions we will also attempt to reach a clearer understanding 
  of ourselves (personal identity), our relationship to other people (moral responsibility), 
  and our relationship to the world around us (freedom of the will). Some 
  of the general skills students will develop include the formulating and defending 
  of theoretical positions and the ability to think critically about difficult 
  and abstract issues.

III. CLASS REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING SCHEME

 Requirements.............................................Percent 
  of Final Grade

  Class Participation......................................................10%
  First Paper..................................................................20%
  Second Paper.............................................................25%
  Third Paper.................................................................25%
  Final Exam..................................................................20% 

About the Requirements:
Class Participation--One thing this requirement covers is
your class attendance (if you don't attend class you can't
participate in it). However, to get an "A" for class participation you
must do more than just show up; you have to contribute to class
discussion. You are expected to show up having read the assignment for the
day and ready to talk about it.
The First Paper--There will be a 3-4 page paper due in early 
  October. Topics will be distributed 9 days before the paper is due. Papers are 
  due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late papers are subject 
  to a substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out how much).
The Second Paper--There will be a second 4-6 page paper due in 
  early November. Topics will be handed out about 2 weeks before the paper is 
  due, and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late 
  submission is still not a good idea.
The Third Paper--There will be a third 4-6 page paper due in 
  early December. Again, topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is 
  due, and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late 
  submission = bad idea.
The Final Exam--There will be a cumulative final exam given in class 
  on our last meeting, Wednesday, December 13th (which runs on a Thursday 
  schedule). The exam will consist of short answer questions and essay questions 
  based on the readings and lectures.



  IV. CLASS FORMAT

The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want
to encourage discussion. I hope that you will all have views about the
topics we will address, and I want you to express and explore those views.
It is the nature of the issues we will be considering that people's views
will differ. You are encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when
anyone says something you disagree with, but everyone should always keep
in mind that disagreement is not a personal attack. Philosophical 
discussion thrives under this kind of interaction and often stems from
disagreement. At the same time, philosophical discussion aims at
reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't reach agreement every
time, but we should aspire toward it.

 
 V. TOPICS AND READINGS

Most of the readings will be from the Perry and Bratman book. These will be 
  listed by their pages numbers in parentheses. Readings from the Nagel book are 
  listed by chapter number.
A note about the readings: Philosophical writing is often subtle and 
  difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking 
  that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read at least 
  twice. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second time 
  slowly while taking notes.
The course will cover topics presented in six units. The units and readings 
  for them are as follows. 
1. Purpose, Aims, Methods

  Hume, Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion (57-71)
  Pascal, "The Wager" (49-52) 
    Mackie, "Evil and Omnipotence" (103-110)

3. Knowledge 
 
    Nagel, Chapter 2
    Descartes, Meditations on First Philosophy (116-139)

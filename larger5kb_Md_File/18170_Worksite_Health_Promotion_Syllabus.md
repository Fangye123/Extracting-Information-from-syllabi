  **Classroom Policies**

_Attendance_ : It is your responsibility to attend this class. If you miss a
class meeting for any reason, you will be held responsible for all material
covered and announcements made in your absence. Lecture attendance is noted.
Please be on time and remain for the entire period. Arriving late and/or
leaving early is inconsiderate of your colleagues.   _Classroom Etiquette_ :
Idle conversation (e.g., chit chat) during class is not acceptable, so please
do not participate in it. You may not find it personally disturbing to
yourself to have others talk during a class, but be considerate of those who
do. Please do ask questions or make comments about the topic at hand that will
benefit the entire class, but leave the chatter in the halls where it belongs.
There is no need to ask permission to leave the classroom during lecture, but
please do so discretely and with respect for your classmates.   _Assignments &
Examinations_: Class-related assignments that are not handed in at the
prescribed date/time and missed tests will not be allowed to be made up.
Exceptions to this policy include: serious family emergencies, personal health
matters requiring advanced medical supervision, and university-related
approved absences. Written excuses must be turned in two weeks prior to the
expected absence or by the next class period in the case of an immediate
emergency. All make-up tests and work will be conducted at a time designated
by the instructor.   _Dishonesty_ : All assignments and exams must be the work
of the individual student unless otherwise indicated by the professor.
Cheating, including: (a) copying or obtaining information from another
student's test paper, (b) using materials not authorized by the insturctor
during a test, (c) collaborating, conspiring, or cooperating during a test or
on any written assignment not otherwise authorized by the instructor, (d)
stealing, buying, or otherwise obtaining all or part of an unadministered
test, (e) selling or giving away all or part of an unadministered test or
assignment, (f) substituting for another student on any class project or
during a test, (g) submitting as one's own any theme, report, term paper,
essay, other written work, painting, drawing, sculpture, musical composition,
or other art work prepared totally or in part by another person, (h) any other
devious means of securing an unearned grade in a non-credit course or in a
course offered for credit. A student looking onto another student's paper is
considered cheating, as is possession of a condensation of material
constituting a "cheat sheet." All previously mentioned offenses will result in
an "F" on the assignment and possibly for the course. See the appropriate
section relating to Academic Misconduct in the university catalog for more
information.

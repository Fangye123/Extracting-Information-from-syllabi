>

> **Organization:**

>

> The course consists of units of readings and activities with PowerPoint
presentations on the class electronic communication system, discussion board
discussions, in-class discussions and exercises, out-of-class assignments, and
group presentations.  
>

>

> **Requirements:**

>

> Students are expected to read the assigned textbook chapter and to read the
PowerPoint presentations for each unit **_before_** the class period in which
that unit is to be discussed. Students are also expected to complete other
readings, participate in class discussions, and to complete assignments.
Students are responsible for using the resources of the department and the
university to learn how to use the University catalog and other public
retrieval systems, the University libraries, electronic mail, and Blackboard.  
>

>

> **Reading Materials:**

>

> The required readings are available on reserve in the Information Sciences
Library.  
>

>

> **Assignments:**

>

> Due dates for assignments are included in this syllabus. Students are
encouraged to ask for assistance with them when needed. The assignments that
are assigned to groups or pairs are to be done with the assigned person(s),
with only one version of the response being submitted for each group or pair.
On individual assignments you may discuss your work with each other, but the
ultimate work you turn in should be the result of your having done the work
yourself, not having copied "answers" from other students.  
>

>

> **Class Electronic System:**

>

> A class discussion board has been set up for the purpose of stimulating
discussion and observation on topics related to the content of the course.
Please do not put gripes or flames on the discussion board. Participants
should always be respectful of others' ideas, but they should also feel free
to share different perspectives or opinions.

>

> Each member of the class is expected to make at least five contributions to
the class discussion board, and to make other contributions as required to
fulfill the portfolio assignment. You will be given suggested topics for each
unit. Other comments may be made on an issue that has come up in the readings
or PowerPoint presentations, an intellectual concern emerging from past
experiences, etc. Students are encouraged to post as often as they have
something to contribute or have questions.

>

> You should collect your substantive postings to the electronic system and
turn in the collection in a portfolio (with your summaries of contributions to
class discussions) at the end of the term. The portfolio will be graded as an
assignment, although for this assignment only, spelling and grammar will not
be taken into consideration. This is to encourage postings that are like
participation in a classroom where spelling and grammar are not corrected in
oral discussions, comments, and questions.

>

> One forum on the discussion board is for questions specifically addressed to
the Professor. (These do not count as your substantive post for the week!)  
>

>

> **Evaluation:**

>

> Evaluation of your work is as follows:

>

>> 20% Group report  
>  80% Assignments, class participation, class electronic participation

>

> Completion of all work (including 14 posts to the electronic discussion
board) is expected regardless of its proportion of the grade. No student will
receive an "A" unless all work has been completed (regardless of point
average).

>

> **Late Policy:**

>

> All assignments must be turned in on time. Late assignments are strongly
discouraged. If late work appears to be unavoidable, one should communicate
with the professor about the circumstances.

>

> **Plagiarism:**

>

> Plagiarism will not be tolerated. For an explanation of what constitutes
plagiarism, see "Avoiding Plagiarism," by David J. Birnbaum and Helena
Goscilo:
[**http://clover.slavic.pitt.edu/~tales/02-1/plagiarism.html**](http://clover.slavic.pitt.edu/~tales/02-1/plagiarism.html)

>

> The result of plagiarism on any assignment will be an "F" for at least that
assignment. If the plagiarism is found to be a repeat offense, the grade for
the course will be an "F."

>

> **Groups:**

>

>   _Assigned groups_ will be constituted for group presentations. These
groups will be given group space in Blackboard.  
>

>

> **A Note on Special Needs:**

>

> Students with disabilities who require special accommodations should notify
the instructor and the University's Office of Disability Resources & Services
(DRS) no later than the 2nd week of the term. Students may be asked to provide
documentation of their disability to determine the appropriateness of the
request.  
>

>

> **Language Courtesy:**

>

> Inclusive language: Gender-inclusive language is required in all course
work. The use of respectful language in any situation is not a matter of
"political correctness" but one of simple courtesy.

compelled politically to fight in Vietnam; feared impeachment and McCarthyite
movement  
>  LBJ hoped to win a victory before 1966 elections

>  Tet Offensive of 1968 timed to have impact on U.S. elections  
>  Nixon fears "peace movement" will show U.S. weakness  
>  October 1969 moratorium probably undercuts Nixon's ultimatum to Hanoi  
>  Many officials in the Nixon Administration had family members (usually sons
and daughters) in the antiwar movement, including Haldeman and Ehrlichman  
>  Kent State forces early withdrawal from Cambodia  
>  Antiwar forces are strongest in Congress - especially the Senate

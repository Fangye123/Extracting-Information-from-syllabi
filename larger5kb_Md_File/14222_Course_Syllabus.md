Course Syllabus

Course Description**

> A course designed for students who desire to understand the acquisition and
analysis of geographically referenced data for the management of crop
production systems. Topics include: mapping, map projections, implementation
of global positioning systems, data formats, geographic information systems,
grid sampling, soil fertility and physical properties,  yield monitoring,
variable-rate application, crop modeling and economics.

**

Course Rationale**

> Grain producers have long recognized that variability exists within
individual fields. Traditional cropping practices dictate that producers treat
these production units on a "field-average" basis -- that is to treat the
entire field the same. With the advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS)
it is now possible to vary inputs in accordance with localized conditions.
This coupled with the capacity to monitor yields and generate yield maps has
given producers new tools to manage variability and optimize production. This
course is designed to provide students with a fundamental understanding the
essential tools for collecting, organizing and presenting geographically
referenced crop production data. An in depth treatment of "state-of-the-art"
equipment and practices is presented. The course is open to upper level
undergraduate students and graduate students enrolled in the College of
Agriculture, or Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering.

Course Objectives

**

>   1. Students will develop a working knowledge of concepts and principles of
precision agriculture.

>   2. Students will learn to collect and create spatially referenced data and
then  integrate and analyze data into a GIS  along with other spatial data
sources.

>   3. Students will learn to develop a precision agriculture management plans
to increase profitability, and reduce economic and environmental risks
associated with agricultural production

_Assignments_

**

> Projects will be assigned in class via hard copy. In the event that you miss
a class, all handouts will be available on the course web page the next
working day. Assignments will include a due date not less than one week after
the project assignment is made. This schedule will allow students to ask
questions prior to submission of their work. Please take advantage of this
schedule by starting assignments early. **

**

> All work is to be an individual effort unless otherwise noted.  **Academic
Misconduct will not be tolerated e.g. plagiarism (Please see Students Rights
and Responsibilities at**<http://www.uky.edu/StudentAffairs/Code/> **).**
Submissions with consistent and similar errors will be given a score of zero.
When using electronic media to solve an assignment you are required to submit
both hard and electronic copies. All submissions must include your name
prominently displayed at the top of the first page or at the beginning of the
file. Failure to include your name on an assignment will result in a score of
zero for that assignment. All submissions via e-mail must originate from your
personal e-mail account and must include a signature with your name, major and
school address.

> Assignments are to be submitted through electronic media (i.e., MS Word, MS
Excel, MatLab, ArcView 3.2 and 8.1, etc.).  Failure to submit neatly organized
assignments will result in minimal, partial-credit, or no credit at all. Late
assignments will not be tolerated. You are expected to hand in homework and
lab reports on the assigned date. Failure to do so will result in a score of
zero.

**

_Examinations_**

> The final examination will be comprehensive in nature. Portions of each exam
may be either closed or open-book. You will be notified of the exam format at
least one week in advance.

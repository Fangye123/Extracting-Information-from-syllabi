>> _Course Description_  
>  This course will explore the art and science of effectively teaching
exercise therapy and adapted physical education.  PET 3640 is designed to
facilitate the students' understanding of the specific medical health
characteristics of common disabilities so that the best educational
implications can be determined for any exercise setting.  The goal is to
effectively maximize people's potentials.  
>

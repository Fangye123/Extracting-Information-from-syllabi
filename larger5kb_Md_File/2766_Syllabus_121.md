[  
](mailto:lyle.scruggs@uconn.edu)Comparative politics is both a subject and a
method for understanding politics. As a subject, comparative politics is the
study of different (usually national) political systems, an their major
components-- cultures, structures, and institutions. As a method, comparative
politics is a way of trying to establish and test general claims about
particular political phenomena, using different political units as data.
Understanding comparative politics as both a subject and a method is
complementary. Using political systems as "data" requires an appreciation of
their similarities and differences. The purpose of this class is to introduce
you to major themes and problems in comparative politics as well as provide a
crash course in the analysis of social science information. These are not the
only themes in the course nor are they the only important questions in
comparative politics. It would be impossible to do justice to all of the
issues in a course such as this one.  
  
**_Requirements:_

**_

Readings_ :  
Reading requirements are relatively light ( less than 75 pages a week on
average). There are three reasons It is vital that you do the readings
assigned carefully _prior to the classes in which they are discussed_. First,
it is impossible to talk about everything in class and I will assume that some
stuff is clear from the reading. If you skip the reading or wait until exam
time, it will be harder to keep things straight.   Third, in order to answer
questions when called upon in class (see below), you need to be familiar with
the reading.

_

Attendance_ :  
Most assignments are due in class or require your attendance to complete.
There are no make-up exams. Information in the lectures is often not in the
readings. Alterations in assignments, etc. announced in class are binding on
everyone.  While there is no official attendance policy, you are strongly
encouraged to be in class.

_

Internet_ :  
The Website for the class can be found at
<http://vm.uconn.edu/~scruggs/syl12101.html> . You are expected to be familiar
with the internet and use email. In order to save time (and paper), many
things in class _including any changes to the assignments for the class_ will
be distributed through an email list. Some assignments will require you to use
the internet. _It is your responsibility to ensure that you get on the mailing
list by giving me a valid email address._ (If you are unfamiliar with using
email and the internet, you can get more info from the computer center help
desk at 486-HELP.)

_

Countries for in-depth study  
_ Lectures will look primarily at broad issues in comparative politics, and
often paying less attention to country details. For this reason, each student
will choose a country of interest to them to follow in more detail throughout
the course of the semester. You will be asked to answer some simple questions
on your Explorit Assignments about your country. More details and other
assignments will be provided in class and on the website.  
_  
Evaluation_ :  
Your grade is based on:  
    Explorit Excercises:                                                30%  
    Exam 1                                                                  15%  
    Exam 2                                                                  20%  
    Final                                                                      25%  
    Participation (Games, Class discussion, Misc.)       10%

**

Explorit Exercises:   **There are 12 Explorit exercises.  Students must
complete _nine_ , (and only nine; assignments beyond your ninth will be
returned ungraded).  Assignments must be handed in in class on the due date.
**_Late assignments will _not__ _be accepted_**. .Because they introduce and
explain the methods used later, _you are strongly encouraged to do each of the
first five assignments_.

**Exams** Short Identification and short answer exams. Exams 1 and 2 are not
cumulative; the final will be.   Exams will include questions you will need to
know more about your country to answer.

**

Participation:** The class is primarily lecture, but we are all more engaged
if there is some discussion.  
        _Games_ : Twice in the semester we will divide into groups and play "political games."  Good performance will be rewarded.  
        _Class discussion_ :  Students will be called upon (more or less randomly) to answer questions in class.  Sometimes these will be factual questions (e.g., based on reading), others may be opinion questions.  The purpose of this is _not_ to embarrass people, but to motivate you to be prepared, think and be ready to talk about the material.   I will select people to call on before class; I am not going to search around to call on those who are sinking in their seats.  I will also try to give everyone an equal chances over the course of the semester.  
        _Misc_ :  There is no extra credit, but some account can be taken here for improvement over the course of the semester. 

_All students are assumed to abide by the Student Conduct Code (see in
particular sections on Academic Misconduct)._

Any students with special needs in the semester (due to religious observance,
disability, etc.), please feel free to discuss them with me.

**EXTRA QUESTIONS for ExplorIt exercises**

 **The following questions are to be added to the Explorit assignments at the
place (question number) given.   They ask you to do things specific to your
chosen country. Please answer the questions in the workbook at the appropriate
spot, indicating what your country is; there is no need to write out the
question.  
If you cannot find information on your country in Explorit, with the
suggestions I provided, or on your own, then answer "NA" (for not
available)**_ **.**

country is not included in the Explorit data, visit

Publications" select "Freedom in the World".  Click the link to "Tables and
Charts", then select Table 1:[Table of Independent Countries - Comparative

chapter?

your country.  Does this data provide support for the dependency theory
hypothesis?

_10\. e. (page 72)_   Does the information for your country differ from that
found in the general pattern?  (In other words, is your country an outlier?)
If it is, how would you explain why it differs from the pattern?

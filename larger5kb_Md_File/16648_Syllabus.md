**Course Description**  
Introduction to Culture is a six-credit, two-semester, interdisciplinary
course in the core curriculum. US 350 and US 351 present the cultures of
selected cities around the globe at significant times in their histories; the
courses focus on an examination of the humanities and fine arts to provide
insight into these cultures. They seek to heighten awareness of cultural
diversity, inculcate a sense of the past, and provide lessons for thought and
action in the increasingly interdependent world of today. In addition, the
writing-intensive nature of the course is designed to increase confidence and
competence in research, analysis, critique, and composition.  
  
This course is composed of three units: Enlightenment Paris (18th c. A.D.),
New York of the 1920s with the Harlem Renaissance, and city of your own
choice, to be collaboratively researched.

**Grading**  
Each city unit (Paris, NYC) will account for 30% of your final grade, while
the research assignment will be worth 40%. Your grade for the Paris and NYC
units will be based upon your response papers, class participation, and unit
exams. Your grade for the research portion of the class will be based upon
your research paper and in-class presentation; if need be, your weekly
research assignments will be assigned grades.  
  
**Late work** will not receive full credit. If you are having trouble getting
your work done on time, _please_ come see me sooner rather than later - in a
5-week course, it is imperative that you keep to a tight work schedule as it
quickly becomes impossible to "catch-up" and successfully complete the course.  
  
**Grading scale for class participation:**  
A = Attends class, frequently volunteers, asks solid questions that
demonstrate a mind actively trying to understand and assimilate the course
material  
B = Attends class, occasionally volunteers, questions and responses indicate a
clear understanding of course material  
C = Attends class, seldom volunteers or asks questions, cursory answers when
called upon  
D = Tardy arrival, participation that demonstrates student has not
sufficiently prepared for the class  
F = Misses class without a valid excuse  

**Absences  
** Each class meeting represents 12.5% of the course material, so your
attendance is crucial to your success! Should you need to miss a class for a
valid reason, please let me know as soon as possible, preferably in advance.  
  
**Plagiarism**  
"Plagiarism consists of any intentional or known representation that the work
or opinions of another are those of the student. Most often plagiarism takes
the form of failure to properly acknowledge sources when using exact wording
or paraphrased material, or factual information that is not a matter of common
knowledge. Plagiarism may also take the form of partial or wholesale use of
another's paper, project or presentation." - From the _Ursuline College
Student Handbook_ , 2000-01, page 16.  
  
  
**Expectations of the Students**  
Since US 351 is a collaborative course, regular attendance and careful reading
are essential - both for your own learning and for the success of the class as
a whole. Classes that are involved and work well together tend to be the most
successful and reap the greatest profits from the course. Please be supportive
and respectful of your peers, feel free to question the material before you
(especially your instructor!) and be open to your own creative potential!
Active participation in class is essential to develop the dialogue through
which we learn, so the habit of passive silence or routine absences will be
reflected in the final grade.  
  
Consistent study, attentive reading, regular attendance, active participation,
and keeping up with the assignments are the keys to your success. Ursuline's
Learning Resource Center is a wonderful resource for help with writing or
study techniques; take advantage of it!  
  
  
**Accommodations**  
Students with documented disabilities, including those with learning
disabilities, may be entitled to reasonable accommodations for this course. If
you would like to request testing or other accommodations because of a
disability, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible to discuss
your situation and needs. Effective and timely communication will allow us to
work with the Ursuline College Learning Resource Center to arrange for
appropriate accommodations.  
  
  
**Contacting the Instructor**  
Please don't hesitate to stop by, call or email with any questions or
concerns! I can be found in Mullen 340 before and after class on Tuesdays and
Fridays, and often on Thursday mornings. Calling to schedule an appointment
ensures that I'll have time to devote to your needs.

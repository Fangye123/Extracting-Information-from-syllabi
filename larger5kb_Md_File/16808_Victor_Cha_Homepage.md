**Recently Taught Courses  
  
Spring 2002:**  
_GOVT 434 Department Seminar: Korea, America, and Asia: Politics and Security_
([Syllabus](govt434S02.pdf))  
This new course will investigate the politics and security of Northeast Asia
through the analytic lense of the bilateral United States-South Korea
relationship. Concepts to be studied include: globalization and security;
models of engagement diplomacy; grand strategy and strategic culture; alliance
management; multilateral security institutions; and proliferation. Empirical
topics include the US-ROK alliance and its interaction with China, Japan,
Australia, and Russia; North Korea; the United Nations; and ASEAN. This course
is a reading seminar with class presentations and one major research paper. No
previous background on Korea is expected. Upperclassmen and graduate students
welcome. Students who are writing Asian Studies or IPOL or Govt Honors theses
related in some part to Korea are particularly encouraged to take the class.
Students who have previously taken GOVT 275 must see the instructor before
registering for class. **  
  
Fall 2001** :  
_GOVT 394 East Asian Security_ ([Syllabus](GOVT394-F00.pdf))  
This course provides an introduction to the politics and security of the East
Asian region. The focus is primarily on interaction among the Northeast Asian
powers (China, Japan, Korea, Russia, and the United States). After an initial
survey of regional security dynamics in a historical, Cold War and Post-Cold
War context, we will attempt to answer a number of theoretically-driven
questions regarding stability and security in the region. These include: Over
what issues is the security dilemma most acute in East Asia? Is there a
regional arms race and is it de-stabilizing? To what extent will security
relations be determined by nationalism and historical animosities on the one
hand, or basic balance of power dynamics on the other? What is the potential
for multilateral security cooperation? What is the potential for an Asian
"democratic peace?" Issues to be considered in addressing these questions
include: Taiwan straits, Northern territories, Korean unification, Spratley
islands, and the future U.S. security presence in the region. Students who
have not taken GOVT-006, should contact the instructor about enrolling in the
course. **

**  
U.S. Cultural & Intellectual History  
Prof. Lyde Cullen Sizer  
[lsizer@slc.edu](mailto:lsizer@slc.edu)  
North 7   x2403**

  
"Every society is known by the fictions that it keeps," an historian once
wrote. This course explores the "fictions" kept by diverse Americans in the
19th and 20th centuries through scholarship coupled with ample illustrations.
These include autobiography, novels, essays, and cultural criticism. Rather
than following canonical intellectual history, the course investigates the
work of less well-known Americans alongside some of the classic renderings of
the genre. Major themes include questions of politics, class and regional
conflict; womanhood, manhood, and sexuality; American identity and
nationalism; immigration and race.

| The ability to identify, evaluate and properly use legal texts is at the
core of a lawyer's work.  Legal Research is the study of the texts that
comprise the foundation on which lawyers study precedents, identify issues,
analyze outcomes and formulate positions.  Mastery of this skill is essential
to your success as a legal practitioner and/or scholar.

**Course Policies**  
**and Procedures** |

  * Consistent attendance and timely completion of the assigned readings (75-100 pp./week) are essential to your success in this class. As a result, attendance will be taken at each class meeting. Missing more than 1 of the 8 classes scheduled for the Fall 2002 semester may result in a reduction in your grade.   Although each instructor will be teaching multiple sections, you are required to attend the class meeting at the time scheduled for your section **UNLESS** you have specific authorization from your instructor to attend an alternate section at another time. If a class meeting date falls on a religious holiday you wish to observe, please contact your instructor prior to the week of that class. An appropriate alternative section on another date will be chosen in those instances.  

  * An exam will be given at the end of the semester.

  * Weekly research assignments will be due at the beginning of each class meeting.  Successful completion of all assignments is required.  Failure to successfully complete an assignment will result in the assignment being returned by your instructor for further work, or, alternatively, a new research scenario being assigned, or possibly a reduction in grade. Credit for an assignment will not be issued until it has been completed to the satisfaction of the instructor.  See the section on Grading for more information.

**Grading** | **Grades will be based on the following factors:**  

  * Successful and timely completion of weekly research assignments (30%).
    * **Satisfactory completion of assignments**  
      * No points will be awarded unless ALL assignments have been satisfactorily completed.
    * **Due dates will be strictly enforced.  **
      * Assignments are due at the beginning of class. Because unauthorized late submissions are unacceptable in the legal profession and unfair to other students, penalties will be assessed for late assignments.  Penalties may include a point reduction in your grade.  Time extensions will only be granted in the case of extreme and unforeseeable emergencies, and any request for an extension must be made before the due date time for the assignment.

  * Exam: 70% 

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date published on the
[schedule](syllabus.html).  Any assignments turned in after the beginning of
class are late. Plagiarism is not tolerated. The [Washington University School
of Law Honor Code](http://law.wustl.edu/Students/Rules/honorcode.html) applies
to this class and will be enforced.  Please be aware that the deliberate
removal or secretion of Library materials is a violation of this Code.
Offenses against the Honor Code will be referred to the Honor Council for
prosecution.

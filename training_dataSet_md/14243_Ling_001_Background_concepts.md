Today we'll cover some basic ideas that underly work in linguistics, to help
you understand the approach to language that we'll be taking in this course.

* * *

**What is language?**

The word "language" is used in many different ways. For most linguists,
language __ is the pattern of human speech, and -- what most distinguishes
linguistics from the everyday use -- the (implicit) systems that speaking and
listening rely on.

Other phenomena come to be called "language" because of more or less close
connections or analogies to this central case: writing, sign languages,
computer languages, the language of dolphins or bees. The ordinary-language
meaning of the word reflects this process of extension from a speech-related
core.

Notice the range of meanings in this dictionary entry:

[lan*guage]  
---  
1. | a. | Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols.  
  | b. | Such a system including its rules for combining its components, such
as words.  
  | c. | Such a system as used by a nation, people, or other distinct
community; often contrasted with dialect.  
2. | a. | A system of signs, symbols, gestures, or rules used in communicating: _the language of algebra_.  
  | b. | _Computer Science_  A system of symbols and rules used for
communication with or between computers.  
3. |   | Body language; kinesics.  
4. |   | The special vocabulary and usages of a scientific, professional, or other group: " _his total mastery of screen language \-- camera placement, editing -- and his handling of actors_ " (Jack Kroll)  
5. |   | A characteristic style of speech or writing: _Shakespearean language_.  
6. |   | A particular manner of expression: _profane language_ ; _persuasive language_.  
7. |   | The manner or means of communication between living creatures other than humans: _the language of dolphins_.  
8. |   | Verbal communication as a subject of study.  
9. |   | The wording of a legal document or statute as distinct from the spirit.  
  
_[American Heritage Dictionary, 4th
ed.](http://www.bartleby.com/61/14/L0041400.html)_  
  
Note that the phenomena named by the extended senses are quite different from
one another.

  * Writing is a system of transcription for speech. 
  * Sign languages used by the Deaf are an expression of the same underlying human capabilities as spoken language, but in a different medium (gesture rather than sound). 
  * Computer languages are artificial systems with some formal analogies (of debatable significance) to the systems underlying human speech. 

* * *

The central role of **spoken** language, as seen by the first definition in
the dictionary entry, is also reflected by the  source of the equivalent word
in various languages. One common strategy is simply to use the word **tongue**
to express the concept  "language": it's one of that organ's most obvious
functions in modern humans.

  * French _langue_
    * source of English _language_ as well 
  * Spanish _lengua_
  * Greek _glossa_
  * Russian _jazyk_
  * Irish _teanga_
  * Hebrew _l ashon_
  * Hausa _harsh ee_
    * a Chadic language of Nigeria and Niger 
  * and of course English _tongue_! 

Another typical source is a word related to a verb such as **speak** or
**say** , the basic linguistic act; or a noun meaning **speech** or
**word(s)** , what language consists of.

  * German _Sprache_
    * cf. _sprechen_ "to speak"
  * Dutch _taal_
    * related to English _tale_
  * Sanskrit _bh aSa_
    * cf. _bh aS-_ "speak"
  * Mandarin Chinese _y u (yan)_
    * also "talk; words, speech"
  * Japanese _kotob a_
    * also "word"
  * Korean _mal_
    * also "words, speech"
  * Hawaiian _' olelo_
    * also "to say"
  * Alsea _yul_
    * also "to speak"; a native language of Oregon 
  * Kashaya _cahno_
    * also "to utter" and "word"; a native language of California  

The core of the field of linguistics has always been the analysis of spoken
linguistic structure, and this course will introduce the basic concepts of
this disciplinary core. However, there's a lot of intellectual, practical and
human interest in other aspects of the study of language, and we'll mention
these as well when it's appropriate.

* * *

**What's a dialect?**

In common parlance, "dialect" implies a nonstandard variety of a language.
This can be seen in the first definition below, which uses "language" for the
standard variety. (Cf. definition 1c for "language" above.)

[di*a*lect]  
---  
1. | a. | A regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary, especially a variety of speech differing from the standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it exists: _Cockney is a dialect of English_.  
  | b. | A variety of language that with other varieties constitutes a single
language of which no single variety is standard: _the dialects of Ancient
Greek_.  
2. |   | The language peculiar to the members of a group, especially in an occupation; jargon: the dialect of science.  
3. |   | The manner or style of expressing oneself in language or the arts.  
4. |   | A language considered as part of a larger family of languages or a linguistic branch. Not in scientific use: _Spanish and French are Romance dialects_.  
  
_[American Heritage Dictionary, 4th
ed.](http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/D0194900.html)_  
  
For linguists, however, no one actually speaks an entire "language"; rather,
every utterance occurs in some (social and geographical) dialect of a
language.

  * Different dialects are mutually intelligible varieties of a language. 
  * Different languages are not mutually intelligible with one another. 

Nonstandard dialects lack prestige, but not logic or communicative function. A
dialect may be socially stigmatized, just like a particular word or usage may
be; but that says nothing about its linguistic status.

* * *

**Beliefs about language**

Attitudes toward dialects bring up the fact that linguists and laypeople often
have different views toward linguistic issues.

There are plenty of valid controversies about language. Some questions are
entirely political:

  * should governments try to accommodate speakers of minority languages? 
  * how important is it to maintain rigorous standards of usage? 
  * is it bad to borrow words from another languages rather than inventing native ones? 

Other questions are factual, though they have immediate practical
consequences:

  * does bilingual education work? 
  * what are the consequences of oral education for deaf children? 
  * to what extent can ordinary citizens understand legal contracts? 
  * how well do computer speech recognition systems work? 

Still other questions are mainly interesting to those who care about language
itself:

  * are Korean and Japanese derived from the same ancestral language? 
  * how much of linguistic structure is an innate faculty of the brain, and how much emerges from the experience of communication? 

Reasonable and informed people can and do disagree about these and innumerable
other linguistic issues. Particular arguments may be illogical, or particular
claims may be false, as in any debate, but our state of knowledge leaves room
for a range of opinions.

* * *

On the other hand, there are some disagreements about language where one side
is just wrong, as wrong as those who believe that [the Earth is
flat](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/flatearth.html) or that it was created
out of nothing in [4004 BCE](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/ussher.htm).

These include plenty of misconceptions about language among otherwise
reasonable people, simply because they have never really learned how language
works.

  * Non-standard dialects are less logical than standard dialects. 
  * Languages degrade over time. 
  * The language that you speak determines the way you think. 

In this course we'll see why these myths are, in fact, provably wrong. For
more examples, see [The sci.lang FAQ](http://zompist.com/langfaq.html).

* * *

**" Grammar"**

When beginning the study of linguistics, it's important to understand what
linguists normally mean by the word _grammar_. The following distinction is
crucial.

**Prescriptive grammar** : Rules of proper usage that distinguish "good"
grammar from "bad" grammar. An example according to this perspective:

  1. Good: 
    * **He doesn't know.**
  2. Bad: 
    * **He don't know.** 

The perceived problem with #2, of course, is that verbs in standard English
generally require the agreement suffix _-(e)s_ when the subject is third
person singular, i.e. _does_ rather than _do_.

(Not all verbs do this, however: Even in standard English, so-called modal
verbs such as _can_ , _will_ , _should_ , etc. never take this agreement
suffix. So clearly subject-verb agreement is not necessary for the language to
function! Many languages dispense with it entirely, such as Swedish and
Chinese.)

* * *

**Descriptive grammar** : What native speakers know about their language in
order to make use of it. A similar example according to this perspective:

  1. Grammatical (depending on dialect, style, etc.): 
    * **He doesn't know.**
    * **He don't know.**
  2. Ungrammatical (regardless of style): 
    * ***He not know.**
    * ***He known't.**
    * ***Not know he.** 

(The asterisk means "ungrammatical" in the linguistic sense, i.e. inconsistent
with the native speaker's knowledge and use of the language.)

For a linguist, the sentences in #1 both illustrate a fundamental property of
English, called **do-support** : when most verbs take the negative word _not_
, they require addition of the verb _do_ because the main verb is not
permitted to bear the negation itself.

> The same thing happens in questions:

>

> **Do you know them?  
>  *Know you them?**

Compared to this rather odd and interesting restriction -- it's unknown in
most languages -- the question of whether or not the agreement suffix _-(e)s_
is present seems  quite boring from a scientific point of view.

* * *

It's often said that nonstandard dialects are inferior to the standard dialect
(usually called "language" in this context) because they are less logical, or
simplified versions of the standard.

In fact, the rules by which nonstandard dialects work are often more logical
or more complex than those of standard dialects.

An example of **greater logic** :

> The nonstandard reflexive pronouns **hisself** _,_ **theirselves** use the
possessive pronoun just like _myself, yourself, ourselves_ do.

  | **my** hat | **my** self  
---|---|---  
  | **your** hat | **your** self  
  | **his** hat | **his** self  
  | **her** hat | **her** self  
  | **our** hats | **our** selves  
  | **your** hats | **your** selves  
  | **their** hats | **their** selves  
  
> Standard **himself** _,_ **themselves** irregularly use the object pronoun
form in two (or three) instances.

  | **_my_ ** hat | see me | **my** self  
---|---|---|---  
  | **_your_ ** hat | see you | **your** self  
  | his **** hat | see **_him_** | **him** self  
  | **_her_ ** hat | see **_her_** | **her** self  
  | **_our_ ** hats | see us | **our** selves  
  | **_your_ ** hats | see you | **your** selves  
  | their **** hats | see **_them_** | **them** selves  
  
An example of **greater complexity** :

> A nonstandard double negative ( _I don't see nothing_ ) is actually the
agreement with the negative marker **_not_** modifying entire clause.

>

> When the subject of the sentence needs to take this copied negation, the
order is reversed, since the **_not_** has to occur to the left of the
agreeing word.

>

>> Ca _n't_ _nobody_ hold me down.  
>  * _Nobody_ ca _n't_ hold me down.  
>  * _Nobody_ can hold me down.   _(ungrammatical in this dialect)_

>

> If necessary, _ain't_ is added as a kind of  negative support (similar to
standard do-support).

>

>> Ai _n't_ _nobody_ saw me.  
>  *__ _Nobody_ saw me.   _(ungrammatical in this dialect)_

>

> By the way, many "standard" languages use double negatives all the time,
including French, Spanish, and Russian.

>

>> I do _n't_ see _nothing_.

>>

>> Je _ne_ vois _rien_.  
>  _No_ veo _nada_.  
>  _Nichevo_ _ne_ vizhu.

* * *

**Arbitrary correctness**

For the most part, judgments about what type of language is "right" and what
type is "wrong" is an accident of history. The following example illustrates
how arbitrary it can be at times.

Richard Faust, in _Columbia Magazine_ , 11/83, points out that there is a
historical tendency for the _-ed_ ending to drop in commonly used terms that
start out as phrases of the form **_Verb-ed Noun_** :

**_Newer (reduced) Form_** |

**_Older (full) Form_**  
---|---  
  |  
  
**skim milk** |

skimmed milk  
  
**ice cream** |

iced cream  
  
**popcorn** |

popped corn  
  
**roast beef** |

roasted beef  
  
**wax paper** |

waxed paper  
  |  
  
**ice tea** |

**iced tea**  
  |  
  
whip cream |

**whipped cream**  
  
cream corn |

**creamed corn**  
  
Many of these terms are now standard without the _-ed_ , such as _ice cream_ ,
and they sound odd in the older form. For example, Mr. Burns on "The Simpsons"
is known for his old-fashioned way of talking, as illustrated by the use of
_-ed_ in places where it has generally been abandoned.

"I feel like such a free spirit, and I'm really enjoying this so-called ...
_iced_ cream. "

  |
[![](burns.gif)](http://www.thesimpsons.com/bios/bios_townspeople_burns.html)  
---|---  
  
_Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons  
Episode [1F05](http://www.snpp.com/episodes/1F05.html), Bart's Inner Child_  
  
Other phrases have not achieved this status yet, and sound distinctly informal
without _-ed_ , such as _cream corn_. But  in linguistic structure, they are
identical; the relative status depends not on "logic" or "grammatical
correctness" in any meaningful sense, but rather on what has achieved social
acceptability.

Here's a current example. I have noticed lately that CD's and DVD's are often
sold in **box sets** rather than **boxed sets** , though both terms are
common. Two web searches on [Google](http://www.google.com/), a year apart,
found evidence of an increasing preference for "box set":

| _January 2001_ | _January 2002_  
---|---|---  
**" box set"** | **144,000** hits |  = **59%** | **333,000** hits |  = **66%**  
**" boxed set"** | **98,700** hits |  = **41%** | **172,000** hits |  =
**34%**  
  
I personally find the phrase _box set_ rather odd -- I expect to see  "a set
of boxes" \-- but clearly many other speakers of the language have a different
point of view. Either term has ample precedent in English ( _skim milk_ ,
_creamed corn_ ); I just haven't gotten used to this particular phrase yet.

Given the usual trend, and the preference reflected in the web search, _box
set_ is likely to win out. I'll just have to get used to it, as others in the
past had to get used to _ice cream_ when they had grown up saying _iced
cream_. Those who don't adjust will eventually sound like Mr. Burns.

* * *

It's instructive to think of attidutes toward language usage as a kind of
**fashion**.

[![](ElizabethPor.gif)](http://www.twingroves.district96.k12.il.us/Renaissance/TowerofLondon/ElizabethI.html)
|

Some styles are hopelessly outdated.

Speaking today in Elizabethan English, such as asking your roommate Hast thou
bought the detergent?, would be absurd.  
---|---  
  
Other styles are appropriate today, if not in every circumstance.

Whom did you see? is good, but formal, modern English.

It would be silly to ask your friend, Whom did you see at the frat party? |

[![](elizabeth_II_crown.jpg)](http://www.royal.gov.uk/family/hmqueen.htm)  
---|---  
  
[![](amidala.jpg)](http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/users/01/duffy/amidala.html)
|

Still other styles are complete fantasy.

Similarly, some standards of usage have no basis in English grammar, such as
the prohibition on split infinitives.

(This prohibition was based on the fact that a Latin infinitive is a single
word, e.g. _amare_. Since Latin was consider the  "ideal" language, the silly
conclusion was that English two-word infinitives such as _to love_ should be
treated as if they were one word as well!)  
---|---  
  
Importantly, however, particular styles are appropriate for some contexts but
not for others \-- depending on whether you're accepting an Oscar, chatting on
a talk show, or battling evil.

---|---  
[![](lucy_liu.gif)](http://www3.bc.sympatico.ca/lucyliu/F_updates.htm)  
  
Similarly, you have to adopt different speaking styles \-- and different
grammatical usages -- depending on the situation, audience, and purpose of
communication. None of these is necessarily "better" than the others from a
linguistic point of view, but one style will usually be the most appropriate
in any given circumstance.

* * *

**Changing fashions**

Linguists like to poke fun at prescriptivists by citing some historical
objections that are hard to understand today. This is a bit unfair, since of
course the examples are selected from cases where complaint and ridicule
failed to stem the tide of change. One might also cite a set of linguistic
innovations that died out instead of taking over. On the other hand, people
generally feel compelled to speak out against a particular usage just in case
it is spreading.

In 1837, the Englishman Captain Frederick Marryat ridiculed the following
American usages, which all seem perfectly reasonable today (though some,
especially _stoop_ , do retain a certain informal character).

  | **fix** |  instead of  | **prepare**  
---|---|---|---  
  | **strike** |    | **attack**  
  | **great** |    | **splendid**  
  | **right away** |    | **at once**  
  | **stoop** |    | **porch**  
  
In books like _Words and Their Uses_ **** (1870) and _Everyday English_
(1880), American Richard Grant White objected to

> "words that are not words, ... a cause of great discomfort to all right
thinking, straightforward people."

His examples of "non-words" included:

> **reliable  **(1850) **  
> telegraph  **(1794) **  
> donate  **(1845, U.S.) **  
> jeopardize  **(1828, though once in 1646) **  
> gubernatorial  **(1734 and 1809, both in U.S.)

These were relatively new creations at the time (as indicated by first
recorded uses shown), and thus did not have the level of acceptance they do
today -- since they're quite well established now.

> In 1828, Noah Webster wrote the following about **_jeopardize_** :

>

>> "This is a modern word used by respectable writers in America, but
synonymous with _jeopard_ , and therefore useless."

>

> Now it's the shorter word that's useless, or rather unused.

>

> In fact, while well attested from 1374-1654, **_jeopard_** was already
marked obsolete in Samuel Johnson's dictionary of 1755\. Vesey said this about
_jeopard_ in 1841:

>

>> "it is quite out of use," and its attempted revival "indicates rather a
spirit of research than good taste."

White also objects to words that are really words, but are "constantly
abused":  
  **_Good_** | **_Bad_** | **_Comments_**  
---|---|---  
pitcher | jug |  
remainder | balance |  
overtake | catch |  
earth | dirt | "dirt means filth, and primarily filth of the most offensive
kind."  
leading article | editorial |  
wharf | dock | "docks must be covered"  
send | transmit |  
oversee | supervise |  
condemn | repudiate |  
home | residence |  
recover | recuperate |  
killed | executed | "a perversion"  
settle | locate | "insufferable"  
convince | persuade | "vulgar"  
good | splendid | "coarse"  
jewels | jewelry | "of very low caste"  
? | caption | "laughable and absurd"  
iced cream | ice cream | _(remember Mr. Burns?)_  
  
Note that Marryat and White, only 33 years apart though on opposite sides of
the Atlantic, have quite different views regarding the use of **spendid**.
Also, both verbs **convince** and **persuade** are perfectly acceptable now,
but prescriptivists require _convince that_ but _persuade to_.

Again, these perspectives are essentially arbitrary. You certainly have to pay
attention to the prevailing standards in order to use language in a way that
will be considered "standard" or prestigious, but the details themselves are a
matter of fashion.

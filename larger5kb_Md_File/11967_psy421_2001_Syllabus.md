TEXT: Hergenhahn, B. H. (2001). An Introduction to the History of Psychology,  
                                                       Fourth Ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth

**Class Description:** This course should be interesting and helpful to your
understanding of yourself, and of psychology as a discipline and a science.
Knowing some history and theory should enhance your appreciation of all of
your psychology courses and even some of your courses in other disciplines. In
this course we examine many of the ideas that have shaped psychology and how
they developed. Basically, we tell a story about the historical attempts that
were made in trying to understand psychological concepts and how they
interface with each other, and with facts and other ideas. We study where
concepts began and how they interrelate and form theoretical frameworks and
systems. We will explore how particular systems developed and changed as a
function of interactions with new ideas, conceptual analyses, social contexts
and empirical justifications.

** **         Many of the topics that we discuss are among the most
influential ideas in the history of civilization, and often require some
mulling over to appreciate. There isn't enough time in class to discuss all of
the important people and ideas we read about, so if there are issues you
particularly wish to discuss, it is your responsibility to introduce them into
a discussion. Class time should be spent in clarification, expansion,
discussion, and drawing relationships; and to a lesser extent, in the
presentation of new ideas. I strongly recommend that you read the assignments
prior to the class period and come to class prepared to discuss them. It would
be of value if you write out comments or questions you wish to discuss and
bring them to class.

        The textbook (IHP) is quite good. A major strength is that it has fairly broad coverage, ranging from the pre-Socratic thinkers to a presentation of some current psychology, and it includes views that tend to be omitted by some other texts. Most, if not all, of the text will be assigned. In addition, I am likely to assign additional readings for some of the topics. Readings and class discussion are core components of the class. They will help you identify the topics of greater and lesser emphasis.

This Syllabus is accessible from my class URL: <http://cas-
courses.buffalo.edu/classes/psy/segal/>. Class notes and other information,
including links to outside readings, will be accessible from the on-line
syllabus, usually before they are discussed in class. Bringing the online
notes to class should help classroom participation and attention to classroom
discussion..

        Class requirements include writing a paper (See guidelines), and taking two midterms and a final exam. Your course grade will be based primarily on the exams and the term paper (approximate weights: midterms 25% each, final 30%, term paper 20%), but classroom discussion may be considered.

> **_TIPS FOR DOING WELL IN THIS COURSE_**

  
Learning involves both thought and repetition, and you need time to digest and
think about readings and lectures. _The surest way to benefit from this course
and earn a high grade is to study the course material all during the term, not
just before an examination._ You need to: 1)  take good notes on class
lectures -- I often present important issues and interpretations not in either
of the required books; 2) attend class regularly; 3) read all assignments
**before** they are discussed in class; 4) review your class notes during the
day or evening after class. If you do well on the first one or two exams,
don't lose your chance for an A by slacking off. **_Be sure to take advantage
of review sessions, study skill sessions and tutoring._**

During lectures, I present interpretations of the topic I am discussing, not
just factual information. Indeed I often present factual information to
support my interpretation, much as a lawyer presents facts to support his
case. These interpretations are a very important part of the lecture and you
will be tested on them as well as factual material. Sometimes you can
recognize these interpretations because I pose questions and then answer them.
Understanding my interpretations can also help you to organize the factual
material better, as you will see better why I think certain facts are
important.

Much of this course involves learning to improve your reading and writing
skills. Try to adjust your reading speed according to the difficulty of the
material. You may sometimes find that you need to read slowly. Frequently you
will need to look up difficult words in a good dictionary. This is normal, and
is nothing to be ashamed of.

I and our teaching assistants welcome students to come by during office hours
to discuss the course material. We enjoy talking to you. You need not be
having a problem to come by. Of course, if at any time you are having
difficulties understanding the material, working on your paper, or with any
other aspect of the course, please come talk to one of us about the problem.
It is quite common even for seniors to run into difficulties in their studies.

If you cannot come during office hours, please speak to me or a teaching
assistant after class or leave a message on voice mail at my office phone
number (460-6868), in the History Department between 8 AM and 3:30 PM
(460-6210), or by e-mail (mmonheit@jaguar1.usouthal.edu) with the best times
to reach you and an appointment will be arranged.  
    
    
  

**COURSE MATERIALS AND REQUIREMENTS**

_REQUIRED READINGS, Available in Student Bookstores:_

Marvin Perry, _Western Civilization, A Brief Survey,_ **FOURTH EDITION**
**Volume I** , Houghton Mifflin, 2001, packed with _Rand McNally Historical
Atlas of the World_. *****DO NOT PURCHASE ANY OTHER EDITION.***** (If
purchased used, may be missing the _Atlas_ \-- the _Atlas_ is not required).

Perry M. Rogers, _Aspects of Western Civilization_ , **FOURTH EDITION** ,
**Volume I** , Prentice Hall, 2000. *****DO NOT PURCHASE ANY OTHER
EDITION.*****

Perry, _Western Civilization_ provides a history of the West. It also comes
packaged with a _Historical Atlas_. Perry M. Rogers, _Aspects of Western
Civilization_ , provides many primary source documents -- writings by people
who lived "back then."  _I WANT YOU TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE DOCUMENTS IN
ROGERS. THEY ARE REQUIRED FOR THE COURSE, AS IS THE TEXT-BOOK (Perry)._ I hope
these first hand readings will give you a sense of how people thought, and
also introduce you to some of the sources from which historians like Perry
have derived their knowledge.

**_COURSE REQUIREMENTS, GRADING AND EXAMINATIONS_ :**

**_In-class examinations (70% of grade)_ :**

There will be three in-class hour long examinations and a two-hour final exam.
Your average grade on the three in-class exams will count for 70% of your
grade. **THE LOWEST OF THE THREE IN-CLASS HOUR EXAM GRADES WILL BE
AUTOMATICALLY DROPPED. THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UPS ON IN-CLASS EXAMS SO IF YOU
MISS MORE THAN ONE, IT WILL BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PASS THE COURSE.**

**THE THREE IN-CLASS EXAMINATIONS WILL BE ON FRIDAY, SEPT. 21, FRIDAY, OCT.
26, FRIDAY, NOV. 16.**

**_Final Examination (two hours - 30% of grade)_ :**

>  Section 3, Monday, December 10, 8 am - 10 am

> Section 4, Friday, December 7, 10:30 am - 12:30 pm

_Last Day to Drop This Course_ , Friday, November 9  
_Last Day of This Course:_ Tuesday, December 4  
_Grading Scale_ : 90 and above = A, 80-89 = B, 70-79 = C, 60-69 = D, 59 and
below = F  
  
**_Classroom Behavior and Attendance_**

**In a class of this size it is disruptive to other students if you arrive
late or leave early.** **Cell phones and pagers must be turned off.  **

**Talking to your neighbor is also disruptive and distracting to your fellow
students -- if you do so repeatedly you will be asked to stop and you may be
asked to leave.**

Attendance is not required. However much of the material on the four
examinations comes from my lectures, so it will be difficult to pass the
course without attending classes regularly. Notes for lectures are not
supplied by me or the teaching assistants -- please do not ask us to review a
lecture you missed. You are responsible for finding out from other students
about the contents of lectures you miss, as well as about announcements in
class concerning examinations, changes in deadlines, etc.

_Makeup exams_ : I do not make up the hour-long examinations, since I drop the
lowest grade. If you miss more than one in-class examination, the missed
examination will count as a zero (0) grade and it will be nearly impossible to
pass the course. The final examination will only be made up because of a
medically excused absence or other well-documented reason for absence at the
regularly scheduled exam time.

**_Students With Disabilities:_**

In accordance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, students with bona
fide disabilities will be afforded  
reasonable accommodation.  The Office of Special Student Services will certify
a disability and advise faculty  
members of reasonable accommodations.

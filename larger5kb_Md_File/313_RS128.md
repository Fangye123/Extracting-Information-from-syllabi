     German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer once opined that "it has been granted to the Americans _less_ than any other nation on earth to realize the visible unity of the church of God."  
  
     What is religion's role and function for a society as religiously pluralistic as the United States? Bonhoeffer's striking observation reflects upon American expressions of the Christian tradition only. Yet a countless variety of other traditions can be found throughout the United States. Our survey of religion in America will address this question of pluralism vs. cultural identity by reference to the historical development of religion in the U.S. We will begin with a careful examination of the European religious traditions transplanted into the seventeenth-century American milieu. We will also investigate the development of traditions indigenous to the North American continent and examine the underlying American consciousness of "manifest destiny," "sacred space," and the pervading characterization of Americans as a "chosen people."   
  
**Requirements:**  
  
Three exams; two will be given during the class period. The first exam, which
accounts for 25% of the final grade, is scheduled for [**February
12**](stuguid1.htm). The second exam (30%)is scheduled for [**March
19**](stuguid2.htm). The comprehensive final examination (40%) will be
administered on [**April 30**](stuguide.htm), at 6:00 p.m.  
  
Class participation (5%); student attendance and participation is important to
the success of any class. The instructor may add up to 5% to the student's
final grade for solid attendance and active participation in discussions. The
instructor will also subtract up to 5% of the student's grade for poor
attendance and participation. Additionally, students may earn up to 8% extra
credit toward their final grade by submitting responses to study questions
that are linked _only_ to the online course syllabus. Please note that
responses must be submitted via electronic mail to the instructor's address.
This requirement is intended to encourage student use of information
technology.  
  
_Optional writing component:_  
  
World Wide Web Research project: Students who receive at least a C- on their
first examination may opt out of their final examination requirement by
developing an original research paper that reflects an American religion
theme. The project should be at least six but not more than eight double-
spaced pages in length. Students are also encouraged to include photographs
and other images with their projects but must demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the instructor that such images are clear of copyright claims or that they
have received written permission to use copyrighted material.  
  
Research topics may vary widely, _but must be cleared with the instructor
before the spring break recess._. Under no circumstance may a student present
a paper previously written for another course. All student research projects
will be published on the World Wide Web and linked with student projects from
other universities on the American Religious Experience site at
[www.ece.wvu.edu/~bkt](index.html). Student participation in this course
comprises a contractual understanding with the instructor that the student's
writing will be accessible to the public via the World Wide Web. The student
maintains copyright privileges, but agrees to permit publication of his or her
writing assignments on the Internet until June 30, 1998. The instructor will
request that students who, in his opinion, have submitted superior projects,
allow him permanently to add their materials to the American Religious
Experience page. These projects are subject to an informal jury process and
are considered published scholarly articles. Students are responsible for
formatting their projects in h.t.m.l and are encouraged develop pages that are
[disability accessible](http://www.cast.org)\-- access will be discussed
during the first course meeting. Short courses in Web site development are
available throughout the semester.  
  
When grading evaluations and research projects, the instructor will pay
particular attention to the topical content of the paper along with the
conventions of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and the rhetorical devices of
style and logic. Assessment of the student's writing is based on the [_Chicago
Manual of Style_](http://www.bedfordbooks.com/rd/ctchicago.html), and grading
will follow the criteria established by the University's English 1 program.
Students may also wish to consult William Strunk and E.B. White, _The Elements
of Style_. 3rd ed. New York: Macmillan, 1979. For your convenience, an
electronic version of [_Elements of Style_](http://www

.cc.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/) is available at Columbia University.
Another useful resource is the [Writing on the Web](http://www.writing.org/)
project. Students must turn in a 3.5" PC-formatted floppy containing their Web
project on or before April 30. The document must be saved as an .htm or .html
file. For more information on possible project topics, please visit Dr. Thomas
Tweed's [essay guidelines
page](http://www.unc.edu/courses/reli029a/essay.html#top) at the University of
North Carolina.  
  
**Readings:**  
  
1) Winthrop S. Hudson and John Corrigan, _Religion in America,_ 5th edition,
1992.  
2) John Butler and Harry S. Stout, eds., _Relgion in American History: A
Reader,_ 1998  
  
     Other selected primary source materials will appear as hypertext links on the online course syllabus. Students who have not yet activated their University accounts should do so at their earliest convenience. Selected readings are appended as hypertext links to the online version of this syllabus. The instructor will announce in class which readings will be required and which are optional. Required readings will form the basis for classroom discussions throughout the semester, and four source links provide the context for the extra credit study sections. The readings are not extensive but will greatly enhance the student's comprehension of the course subject matter. The instructor has also established a class list service to aid in the cultiviation of a strong academic community among the course participants. List service participation instructions will be made available during the first week of class.

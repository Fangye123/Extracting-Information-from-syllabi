This course is designed to introduce students to the historiography of world
history and to some themes and issues of current interest. A second focus is
on the teaching of world history courses. Students are expected to audit
History 10 during the term, and they will be asked to present a design for the
teaching of one of the themes from weeks 7-12. A final assignment will be the
preparation by small groups of a world history syllabus.

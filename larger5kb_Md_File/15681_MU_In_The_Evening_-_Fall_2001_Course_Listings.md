### Understanding Our World - _A New Series of Courses_

Understanding the history and culture of other parts of the world has never
been so important since the tragedies of Sept. 11, 2001. In response to
requests for more information about topics raised by the terrorist acts, MU In
The Evening is now offering a series of courses focusing on some of those
issues.

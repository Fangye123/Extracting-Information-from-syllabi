GRADUATE READINGS IN 20TH-CENTURY AMERICAN POLITICAL HISTORY

     After a considerable time in the margins, political history
appears to be returning to the center of our discipline.  Some of
the most creative and significant current work in American history
revolves around issues of power, broadly defined.


     The purpose of this course is to provide a sample of the most
interesting, most complex, and most significant work in political
history.  The focus is at times a bit idiosyncratic.  Special
attention, for example, goes to biographies and studies that
explore issues of class, social theory, and radicalism.  Also, we
will reexamine sections of older classics to see how they might
continue to speak to us.


     The requirements for the course include active participation
in weekly discussions, three short papers, an annotated
bibliography on a topic of your choice, and subscription to three
electronic history discussion lists: H-Pol, H-State, and H-Grad.


     Books marked with a "*" are available for purchase at the Yale
Co-Op Bookstore.  In addition, a required packet with the remaining
readings is available at Minitprint, 13 Broadway.

This course will concentrate on the crucial decades which saw the
emergence of modern American culture and society.  Our approach will be
unconventional.  Instead of focusing on individual events and great men,
we will look at broad social patterns.  Focus will be on the monumental
social forces which transformed American life in this period --
industrialization, immigration, and urbanization -- and how Americans
understood and adapted to the changes going on around them.  Particular
attention will be paid to the rise of big business and big government and
to changes in the nature of everyday life, including work, family, school,
and leisure.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

     This class is designed as a lecture, reading, viewing, and discussion
course.  I will lecture twice each week on Mondays and Wednesdays from
10:00-11:00 am (and on a couple of Fridays as noted on the syllabus).
Most Fridays the class will be divided into four small sections to
facilitate discussion of the readings for that week.  Discussion sections
will be assigned the first week of the semester and are an integral part
of the course. Both attendance and participation are therefore essential.
We will also meet five Tuesday evenings at 7:00 pm to view and discuss
films.


     Discussion sections will count for 25% of the course grade. Short
written assignments will be due at each section meeting. These will be
assigned weekly and will usually entail listing questions for discussion,
outlining a reading, or writing a short think-piece.  Completing all of
the weekly readings and preparing for section by putting effort into these
weekly assignments can significantly improve your final grade.  Section
grades will be based equally on these assignments and on oral
participation.


     In addition there will be take-home midterm and final exams.  The
midterm will be worth 35% and the final 40% of the course grade.  (Both
will be assigned well in advance and are expected in on time.)

**Goals** : Students should learn to analyze historical writing in social and
cultural history, master the literature in one sub-field and learn the basic
methodologies.

**Grading** : Grades will be based on a 10-15 page historiographical essay and
complete biography on (50%). I'll show you a few samples early in the course.
Students will also be responsible for a short comparative website review
(10%), being a lead reviewer for one night of class (10%), for a short paper
analyzing data from Historical Statistics of the United States (5%)and for
participating in class discussion, both virtual and real (25%).

You will notice a heavy electronic component in this class. I sometimes run
into students who resist this. As far as I'm concerned, if you don't exist in
cyberspace, you don't exist. You must use an e-mail address, either inside or
outside the University. If you have no web experience of find it intimidating,
I'll be quite happy to set aside some time early in the quarter and go through
this with you. I will not give incomplete grades. If you need one for a
legitimate reason, I will give you the grade earned and revise it when I
receive the missing work.

Assignments

1\. Historiograpical Essay and Bibliography.First identify a topic and clear
it with me. Create a comprehensive bibliography (often this can just be
xeroxed from the most recent book that you can find on the topic), but it must
be current. Amazon,<<http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ats-query-
page/002-2471394-3917652>>,World Cat
<<http://www.lib.neu.edu/gateway/dbases.htm>>and America History and Life
<<http://www.lib.neu.edu/gateway/dbases.htm>>are the best way to do this. The
latter two are available through the Northeastern Library, but not off campus.
J-Stor <<http://www.jstor.org/jstor/>>may lead you to some relevant articles.
Then write a short essay that should include discussions of the three or four
most recent, important books and articles. You should summarize other
literature from book reviews, bibliographical essays and the like. An
important part of this assignment is learning to talk knowledgeably about
books that you've never read, an important trick of the trade. The text should
be 10-12 pages. Presentation is important.

2\. Class discussion  
The important thing here is to learn to read books like a professional
historian.

First read the bibliography and footnotes (that's always where the interesting
stuff is hidden anyhow). What sources are being used? Where were they found?
How current is any bibliography being used? Is there anything obviously
missing from either? Then read the text. By what method are the sources
analyzed? How are the sources (or lack thereof) likely to affect the results?
What other methods might be used? What's the author's thesis? Organizational
strategy? Would somebody with a different background from the author do it
differently? Reach a different conclusion? For this class what matters is not
so much the text of the narrative, but how it was constructed. You should also
familiarize yourselves with material sent out by the lead discussant.

3\. Lead discussant. For each night's class, there will be a lead discussant,
who will seek to read the most important review(s) as of the works under
question and distribute the most important one(s) to the class. If in print
format, they should be scanned for electronic distribution. The discussant
should also look at H-Net or other discussion groups for any discussion of the
topic under consideration. Finally, the discussant should prepare a short
biography of the author (usually gleaned from their home page) to distribute.
Those materials must be sent out the Friday before class. If scanned, please
send the text directly, not attachments. For on-line materials, it's enough to
just send a URL.

4\. Statistical paper. Using Historical Statistics of the United States, the
Statistical Abstract of the United States or their electronic equivalents
prepare a graph showing changes in some major social variable in the United
States since 1900 (ten year intervals are fine). Present the data as both line
and bar graphs. Prepare flattened and heightened copies of the line graph. The
point of this assignment is presentation more than content. I want to make
sure where to find basic time series data.

**HST 203D Course Description and Requirements**

**Course Description:**  
This course introduces students to the multicultural history of the United
States since World War I. The course seeks to provide a firm chronological
foundation for the study of the American past, but also seeks to go beyond
listing important dates and events in order to provide analytical insights
into the institutions, societies, economies, and ideas upon which the United
States is founded. Central themes include: war, depression, immigration, race,
ethnicity, politics, and work.

The focus will not only be on providing students with insights into the
institutions and ideas on which our society is built, but also on making
students more familiar with the outlook and techniques of the historical
profession. To enable this, the course focuses on developing three main
skills: reading and interpreting documents; writing; and thinking critically
about events in the past. Throughout the semester, students will be assigned
primary documents, writing assignments, and discussion exercises in order to
form their own evaluations of issues, peoples, and events of the past and in
order to reflect on their current relevance to today's cultures in the United
States.

  
**Discussions:**  
The purpose of discussion section is to develop critical thinking, listening,
and speaking skills. This is your chance to make connections and discuss your
own evaluations of historical events with your colleagues and with me.
Discussions will occur throughout the term (mostly on Friday's class
meetings), and you are responsible for completing all assigned readings prior
to these discussions. Your participation in discussions is crucial (see
Grades). You must be present in the session in order to turn in and receive
credit for discussion assignments.

**Course Requirements:**  
Attendance and participation at both lecture and discussion sessions  
Completion of all weekly readings prior to discussions  
Completion of all written assignments on time

**Written Assignments:**  
3 out of 4 discussion assignments

**Discussion Assignments** will be 2-3 pages in length, typed, double-spaced,
New Times Roman 12 pt.  
font, with one inch margins. You will be required to answer a question given
to you in advance and you must incorporate the readings from the WWL,
including primary sources, into your paper. You also need to cite your source
by using parenthetical references. You will turn in each discussion assignment
at the beginning of the class in which it is due. Because of the nature of the
assignment, _NO late papers will be accepted_.

**Exams** will be completed in class. You must bring to me 2 blank bluebooks
by Friday, April 26

primary documents provided on the syllabus. There will be two parts to each
exam. The first part will consist of short answer questions and the second
will consist of an essay question. You will receive a midterm exam review
guide and a final exam review guide, and you will have the opportunity to
address any questions you might have about the exams during the Exam Review in
class. Also, please feel free to see me in my office as you study for the

**Primary Sources:**  
Primary sources make up an important part of this course and you will need to
critically read them in order to understand them. Primary sources are sources
from the time period you are studying, and include things such as literature,
oral histories, and government documents. You will be expected to comprehend,
remember, and interpret the primary sources assigned in this class. You can
interpret primary sources on at least three levels, each level becoming more
complex and more probing (and therefore, harder to do!)

When reading a primary source for this class, you should always ask the
following questions:

1\. Descriptive Questions:  
" Who produced the document?  
" When?  
" Who is the intended audience? Who is this document produced for?  
" What story does it tell?

2\. Analytical Questions:  
" Why was this document produced?  
" What purposes was it intended to serve?  
" What does it tell us about the people and/or society that produced it?

3\. Significance Questions:  
" Why was this document saved?  
" Why is it important to us now?  
" Who/what is possibly left out of this document?  
" Why is what we learn from this document important to our understanding of
the past and how we think about history?

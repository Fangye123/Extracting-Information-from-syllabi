**THE CRUSADES**

**Spring, 2000 Professor Peters M: 2-4:30**

**Place:** Lea Library, 6th floor, VPL; **Office Hours:** TW 11-12 or by
appointment; **Office:** Lea Library; **Phone:** 8-8450 or leave a message at
Department 8-8452; **E-mail:** empeters@sas  
There will be a List-Serv for the seminar.

**Subject of Study:** This seminar will investigate both the "traditionalist"
view of the Crusades (the argument that chief focus of the Crusades were the
military campaigns and their consequences that western Europeans launched in
lands that today are Turkey, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, Tunisia, and
Egypt for the purpose of gaining control of the Holy Land between 1095 and the
sixteenth century) and the "pluralist" view (which focuses on the authorizing
agent(s) of various military expeditions and the concept of "Crusade" broadly
conceived).

The course will also consider aspects of the newly-developed concepts of
Christendom and Holy War in the tenth and eleventh centuries, the social,
economic, and religious-political changes that enabled Christians from western
Europe to expand militarily and commercially into the Iberian Peninsula, the
wider Levant, Sicily, North Africa, and northeastern and Baltic Europe, as
well as the formation and transformation of the concept of "Crusade".

Although we will focus on the First, Fourth, and Fifth Crusades in detail, the
seminar will also cast its nets widely, considering also the Christian
opposition to the idea of crusading, crusades against Christians, the
influence of the Crusade movement within western Europe as well as outside,
and the eventual uses of the idea in the world of the sixeenth and early
seventeenth centuries. The seminar will read original source materials in
translation as well as the best contemporary scholarship in English and will
require oral reports and three short research papers.

**Requirements:** Read the required texts on time and think about the reading;
attend and participate actively in seminar meetings, and after the meetings
are over, think about what was done and said in them, present several
(probably at least three) oral reports on materials appropriate to the weekly
topics but beyond the scope of the common reading; write three short papers
based on original sources in translation and the relevant scholarship on them
and the topic you choose from the First, Fourth, or Fifth Crusades.

**Grades:** will be calculated on the following basis:

Active discussion in class meetings - 20%  
First Essay - 10%  
Second Essay - 20%  
Third Essay - 20%  
Oral Reports - 30%

Please remember that there will be other assigned or suggested readings every
week and that there will be oral reports every week. The reading listed above
is the absolutely essential **minimum**. Most weeks you will have a
considerable amount more. Budget your time and your attention accordingly. The
subject of this course is not simple, but it is interesting and will tell you
a lot about a lot of things. What you get from it will be directly
proportional to what you put into it. If told to use **WATU** , use **WATU**!

Introduction & site overview

     This web site was originally designed to supplement the Justice Center course JUST 490A: Contemporary Justice Issues -- Policing & Race in South Africa (see the [course syllabus](../academic/syllabi/j490r_972.pdf)), which looks at the issues and techniques involved in transforming policing in the new South Africa to an instrument of democracy. The South African police have been notorious for their enforcement of racist apartheid laws, lack of accountability, and use of excessive force. The course addresses (1) the difficulties of reducing corruption and establishing a human rights culture in the police service; (2) organizational change and affirmative action; and (3) the new government's responses to the growing crime problems.  
     The course was taught by Janine Rauch, who at the time was Chief Director of Policy and National Crime Prevention Strategy for the Republic of South Africa. Ms. Rauch has been Coordinator of the Policing Research Project at the Center for the Study of Violence and Reconciliation of South Africa and has served as policy adviser to the Ministry of Safety and Security for the government of South Africa.

---|---  
Gathered here are some general information and reference resources about South
Africa. See also the **[News](general/news.html)** page for South African news
sources and the **[History](history/history.html)** page for links to
resources about South Africa's past of institutionalized racism and apartheid
and other historical resources.

**[![News](icons/news.gif)](general/news.html)**|  
---|---  
Crime, the criminal justice system, and recognition of the injustices of the
past are daily news in South Africa. See these sites for up-to-the- minute
reporting on South Africa's confrontation with crime, truth and
reconciliation, and the transition to democracy.

**[![History](icons/history.gif)](history/history.html)**|  
---|---  
Inhabited for thousands of years by African tribal peoples, South Africa's
history from the beginnings of Dutch and British colonization was marked by
racial policies such as slavery, indenture, and inequitable laws, culminating
in the racist policies of apartheid under the Nationalist government
(1948-1993). This page provides links to resources on South African history,
with a particular emphasis on the struggle against the apartheid government
and the transition to democracy.

**[![Human Rights & Race
Relations](icons/humanrts.gif)](humanrts/humanrts.html)**|  
---|---  
The sites linked here provide background information on the human rights
abuses of the past, as well as the efforts of the newly democratic South
Africa to protect and guarantee human rights in the present and future. See
also **[Truth& Reconciliation](truth/truth.html)** to see how South Africa is
attempting to confront the human rights abuses of the past in a spirit of
national reconciliation.

**[![Government & Politics](icons/govt.gif)](govt/govt.html)**|  
---|---  
The Republic of South Africa is constitutional state, with the Constitution
the supreme law of the land. The Constitution provides for a Government of
National Unity (GNU), three tiers of democratic government (executive,
legislative, and judicial) and a chapter on fundamental rights. This page also
includes links to South Africa's major political parties.        |

| **[![Truth & Reconciliation](icons/truth.gif)](truth/truth.html)**|  
---|---  
With its history of racial divisiveness and gross human rights violations
under apartheid, South Africa's challenge has been to confront the past with
justice but without the bloodbath that a policy of retribition might bring
about. Following the example of other nations similary challenged, South
Africa has created a commission whose purpose is both to bring out the full
truth about the past and to foster reconciliation between members of its
formerly divided population. See also the **[Human
Rights](humanrts/humanrts.html)** page.

**[![Criminal Justice](icons/crimjust.gif)](justice/index.html)**|  
---|---  
The criminal justice system was a primary center for human rights abuses and
racial discrimination under the apartheid system, but under the new government
the situation is slowly beginning to change. This page provides links
primarily to general South African criminal justice sites, as well as to sites
dealing specifically with the operations of the judicial system and
corrections. For law enforcement information, see the **[Policing&
Security](justice/policing.html)** page.

**[![Policing & Security](icons/policing.gif)](justice/policing.html)**|  
---|---  
As front-line defenders and enforcers of the apartheid system, the former
South African Police (SAP) were more experienced in the use of force and
intimidation than in the traditional law enforcement and criminal
investigation functions of other Western-style law enforcement agencies. Under
the new government the police -- now known as the South African Police Service
(SAPS) \-- are struggling to transform themselves from a paramilitary force
into a police service under a community policing model. This page offers links
to resources on the police, past and present, as well as to the defense forces
which have traditionally been closely allied to the police.

**[![Crime & Crime Prevention](icons/crime.gif)](crime/crime.html)**|  
---|---  
Crime and violence, including political violence, are big issues in South
Africa. Public lack of confidence in the ability of the South African Police
Service (SAPS) to address crime has manifested itself in the formation of
vigilante groups, such as the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (PAGAD) in
the Western Cape, whose leader was recently murdered. Other citizen
initiatives have followed on widely publicized cases in which armed robbers
tortured or raped their victims. Recent crime statistics, however, indicate
that crime rates are beginning to fall. In the meantime, police are scrambling
to improve their crime prevention, investigative, and enforcement techniques,
often with the help of community and business leaders.

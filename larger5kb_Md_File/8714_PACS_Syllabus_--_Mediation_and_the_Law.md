**Syllabus: Mediation and the Law**  
Duane Ruth-Heffelbower

Course catalogue description:

Mediation and the Law (3 units)

  * Required text: _Grilliot's Introduction to Law and the Legal System_ edition 6 or 7 
  * Mediation has been used by people to settle their differences for as long as people have been disputing. The modern legal system affects the practice of mediation in many ways, and is in turn affected by mediation. This course studies these effects and prepares a mediator to function both within and outside the legal system. Statutory and case law will be reviewed.

Mediation is one method of dispute resolution. In mediation the parties come
to their own resolution of a conflict with the help of a neutral third party.
As a cooperative method, mediation is usually included in the larger category
of "Alternative Dispute Resolution," separating it from the adversarial
techniques which are commonly considered "mainstream."

Mediation always occurs in the shadow of the law, and an understanding of the
nexus between law and cooperative processes is essential to any person who
offers themselves as a neutral.

This course will examine the nature and uses of mediation as a conflict
resolution method in light of the adversarial legal systems found in North
America. How does mediation fit with other dispute resolution methods? How do
laws and other governmental regulations affect the practice of mediation? To
what extent are particular subject matter areas more or less affected by law?

The course will use the tutorial method to focus on those aspects of the law
which are most relevant to individual students. A learning contract will be
established with each student which includes at least 1500 pages of reading
selected with the instructor for the student's focus, 30 pages of writing, and
6 hours of time with the instructor, either individually or with others taking
the class. Field trips and interactive processes will be used as appropriate.

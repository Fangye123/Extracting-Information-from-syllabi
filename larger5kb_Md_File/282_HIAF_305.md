### Course Description

West Africans have long been dynamic participants in African and global
history. This lecture and discussion course examines the history of farmers,
herders, traders, kings, soldiers, slaves, missionaries and administrators,
placing special emphasis on their experiences in the nineteenth and twentieth
centuries. We will begin by exploring the growth of the earliest west African
cities, the influence of Islam, the creation of the trans-Saharan trade and of
west African kingdoms and empires. We will focus on west Africa's
participation in the slave trades and its subsequent adjustment to broader
shifts in the world economy in the nineteeth century. We will spend a
substantial part of the course investigating how west Africans contended with
the social, political, economic, cultural, and environmental challenges and
opportunities of colonial rule and the post-independence period.

### Course Requirements

**Reading Materials

**

All of the readings will be on reserve at the Clemons Library. If you are
unable to locate a particular reading, make sure you have looked it up under
the author and title of the article (if relevant) _as well as_ the author and
title of the edited volume in which the article was published. Course packets
containing most, but not all course readings are available at Brillig Books, 5
Elliewood Ave., 296-9669.

Books on the syllabus which are marked with an asterisk (*) will be available
at the bookstore.

**

Participation

**

We will meet twice weekly. Tuesdays will normally be devoted to lectures, and
on Thursdays, we will discuss the lectures and readings. Discussions will take
a variety of forms, including debates and group exercises. _Attending
discussions is mandatory, and students will be downgraded for unexcused
absences._

Students should have completed the reading assignments **prior** to the
lectures and are not only expected to contribute to class discussions, but
will be graded on these contributions. Class participation does not entail
simply "speaking up in class." Your contributions should reflect that you have
both read and thought about the reading materials assigned.

**

Journals

** _

Over the semester, students are responsible for turning in 7 (seven) journal
entries on any course reading, except for the text (Boahen). Journal entries
should include brief impressions of weekly reading assignments, and should
reflect what you gained from the readings, as well as whether (and why) you
enjoyed/despised them. Journal entries should be brief (no more or less than
one handwritten page) and are due on Thursday _at the beginning of class.

_ **

Map assignment

** _

Familiarity with Africa's geography is essential. Hence all students must pass
a map quiz before the end of the semester. They may take the quiz as many
times as necessary to pass.

**

Written assignments

** _

There will be one midterm and one final examination. Students will also be
required to write two 5 to 7 page papers, for which topics will be distributed
in class. Late papers will be marked down one grade for each day that they are
late (including weekends). Any late papers should be turned in to me (or to my
box in the History department office. Administrative staff in the department
should date these papers).

Grades will be based on the following:

Class participation and journal| 25%  
---|---  
Papers| 25  
Midterm| 20  
Final| 30

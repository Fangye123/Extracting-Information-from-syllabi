    _COURSE DESCRIPTION_

This course is intended as an in-depth exploration of selected topics and
approaches to labor markets and labor relations.  The main strategy is to
contrast the neoclassical theory of the perfectly competitive labor market
with more historical and institutional approaches to labor economics.  The
course is developed into two main parts: 1) the organization of the production
process from theoretical and historical perspectives and 2) an application of
neoclassical, institutionalist and radical/Marxian labor market theory to the
issue of income determination and inequality in earnings by sex.  So, we begin
the course with a focus on the internal structure of the firm and then move on
to consider the effect which gender difference has on the male/female wage gap
in the U.S.

Course requirements include required readings, class discussion and
presentation, an analytical essay paper, comprising 20% of your grade, and two
essay-type exams, each contributing 30% to your grade.  Remember that
preparation for class discussion is essential.  My intention, in Econ 421, is
to run the class as an economics seminar.  Seminars differ from lecture-based
courses in that there is more time given over to questions and a discussion of
the readings.  Indeed, the remaining 20% of your grade will be based on class
preparation, discussion and an in-class presentation/summary of one of the
readings.

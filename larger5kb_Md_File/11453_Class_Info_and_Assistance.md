**Asian American Studies 150 Syllabus**

UC Berkeley, Spring, 1997  
Professor: [Evelyn Nakano
Glenn](http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~ethnicst/glenn.html)  
GSI: Sarah Lau

"Family" is a surprisingly difficult topic to study critically. Virtually all
of us have grown up in families, so we tend to take the arrangements that we
grew up with for granted. Notions of family privacy and loyalty also make it
difficult to penetrate into family lives. Our vision is also clouded by
sentiment and mythology. The Asian American family has been portrayed in
stereotypical and idealized ways as part of the model minority myth. I would
also argue that Asian American family has been interpreted rather
simplistically through a cultural model in which patterns of family life,
kinship obligation, and gender and generational relations are all traced back
to "Asian" cultural values.

In this course, we will question taken-for-granted assumptions, common
stereotypes and myths, and culturalized models of Asian American family. We
will focus on gender and generational relations through a historical and
comparative lens. We will ask: How have immigration policies, racial
discrimination and other economic, political, and social forces of life in the
U.S. impacted family formation and personal dynamics? How do gender and
generational relations differ between Asian American families and other ethnic
families and among different Asian communities? What are the major issues that
today's Asian American families have to confront?

**Course Requirements**

Grades will be determined by weighing the following elements:

Midterm exam (25%) to be given Thursday, March 6

Term paper (30%), integrating library research and family history or interview
data. Due April 24. Details about focus, methods, format and length to be
provided.

Final exam (30%), date and time determined by University's final exam
schedule.

Attendance/short assignments (15%). A pattern of absences will result in a
lower grade.

**Your Responsibilities:** You will be responsible for meeting deadlines, for
information given in class about assignments and changes in the syllabus, and
above all, for contacting the professor or GSI about any problems you may

**Prerequisites** |  C or higher in CSC 210 and CSC 222 (if you have not
fulfilled these requirements, please drop the course). Students are expected
to be familiar with C++. **The knowledge of JAVA is not strictly necessary.**  
**Schedule** |  Plan (email posted on 3/15/99)  ![](new.gif) **  
**Text** |  Goodrich and Tamassia,  Data structures and Algorithms in JAVA.  
**Course Summary** |  The purpose of this course is to introduce the
principles of data structures that allow one to store and collect data objects
with fast updates and queries. The course topics include the following:

![](Bullet8.gif) Overview of Java  
![](Bullet8.gif) Running Time  
![](Bullet8.gif) Stacks, queues, and linked lists.  
![](Bullet8.gif) Sequences  
![](Bullet8.gif) Trees  
![](Bullet8.gif) Priority queues  
![](Bullet8.gif) Dictionaries  
![](Bullet8.gif) Sorting  
![](Bullet8.gif) Graphs  
**Grading** |  The course grade is determined by the total points earned by
students during the semester. There are 1000 points distributed as follows.

50 pts. Attendance (5 free missed days allowed, -5 points for each one after
them)

300 pts 6 -7 written homework assignments

300 pts 4 programming assignments

150 pts one or two mid term examination (dates TBA in class).  
**Feb 8th in class** Solution  
**April 5th in class** Sample Test  Guideline

200 pts Final Exam. **May 10 th 4:10pm - 7pm**.

Current Grade (up to mid-term 2, program 2, and hw 4). ![](new.gif)  
**Late Policy** |  All assignments are due at the beginning of the class on
the due day. **10% off from each day late. No credit if more than 5 days
late.** There is no exception on this policy other than some attenuating
circumstances provable only by official documents (e.g., doctor's statement)
or approved in advance by the intructor.  
**Course Announcements** |  A web page has been set up for the course. This
page will be used as a permanent repository for homework, programming
assignments, their solutions, lecture notes, and course announcements.
Sometimes course announcements are made through email. All students are
responsible for retrieving course announcements made by email or through the
home page. So frequently check your email and read this home page. I will send
email _only_ to your eos email addresses.   Most of documents are in the
postscript or pdf format. You can dowload a free copy of pdf  (acroread)
reader, and postscript viewer (  from the Internet.

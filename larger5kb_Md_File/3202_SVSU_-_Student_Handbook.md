in the spring/summer semesters, students must be enrolled at least half time
during the spring/summer or be pre-registered for at least half-time for the
following fall semester. Students are encouraged to complete the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid since preference for jobs is given to
students eligible for financial aid need-based work study programs. Many
student employment opportunities, however, are available to students
regardless of financial need.

**Student Identification Cards -- "THE CARD"

> Photographs for student identification/transaction cards will be taken at
Orientation. Students will receive their ID/transaction card during
orientation. The ID/transaction card includes the student's name,
identification number, photo and signature.

> The ID/transaction card permits use of Zahnow Library and Ryder Center
facilities. Students with an ID/transaction card may attend athletic events as
well as other campus functions that require proof of enrollment. A magnetic
stripe on each ID/transaction card allows it to function as an on-campus pre-
paid debit card for small value purchases at vending machines, the Bookstore,
Doan Cafe, Health Services, laundry facilities, copiers, etc.; as a declining
balance meal card for students living on campus; and as an ATM card when used
in conjunction with the Totally Free Checking Account offered by TCF National
Bank. Students exercising this last option also may have their student payroll
earnings and financial aid refunds directly deposited into their TCF National
Bank checking account.

give you access to these services and events. For more information, contact

**This course introduces students to the major historical events and schools
of historical interpretation concerning religious change in Britain in the
period between the late Middle Ages and late seventeenth century. By "Britain"
I mean the Kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland, as well as the
Principality of Wales, the Duchy of Lancaster, the Lordships of the Isles, the
Salaries of Cornwall, and all the other political peculiars that littered the
Isles before the union of England, Scotland and Ireland in the person of James
VI & I of Scotland and England. In many places this course is referred to by
its dynastic actors: Tudor (England) and Stuart (Scottish) Britain. I prefer
to drop the old dynastic names and concentrate on the major cultural shift
that took place in the Isles in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It
was then that England and Scotland became Protestant nations, and that Ireland
began creating an identity based on allegiance to Catholicism in counter
distinction to English and Scots Protestantism.**

**Of course, the period 1450-1660 saw many important cultural developments
besides the obvious changes in religion and government brought on by the
Reformation. Known to cultural historians as the English Renaissance, these
years produced some of the greatest authors and playwrights ever to work in
English. Shakespeare and Milton are best known, but the architect Robert
Smithson and the great composers like Dowland, Byrd, and Tallis deserve to be
remembered with them. The era saw the emergence of a capitalist culture in
England and Scotland, as well as the birth of colonial imperialism. Ireland
was the first place ever to be colonized by English and Scots immigrants.
Sometime in the sixteenth century the British Isles left the middle ages
firmly behind, as new systems of government, ideology and economic
organization appeared.**

**But it was not a smooth transition for anyone. Living through these years
meant coping with the universal difficulties-disease, hunger, and war-while
adapting to new religious styles, the new culture, the new economy.
Individuals reacted differently, each to his or her own case, but they had to
react. Part of the story we will explore is the response of individuals to
rapid cultural change. For those living in the era, the Reformation was about
survival more than ideology.**

**Because this is a 4000 level history course, I take some abilities for
granted. I expect students in this course to read and to write a great deal.
In keeping with the History Department's goals, you will be taught to
understand the questions professional historians ask about the period, and to
know the major answers to those questions. At the same time, I will expect you
to construct historical arguments using historical documents. Those arguments
will be cast in the form of essays, and those essays will use standard
historical notation as defined in the[ _Chicago Manual of Style_ or
Turabian](http://www.usu.edu/~history/norm/4250/425cite.html). In the end, I
hope this course will help you to think critically about historical data and
to construct effective, logical arguments about the past.**

**Those expecting a lecture course should be forewarned. Although I will talk
a lot, the course is designed to encourage historical discovery. It is not
about "the right answers." It is about how to find answers to historical
questions. This is no place for passive learners.**

like sand surfing, or a trend in recreation such as the graying of America.
The paper should be of appropriate length for college students and appropriate
sources should be used. In addition to the paper, you need to present this
material to your classmates. The length of the presentation will 15 minutes.

tests. The mid term and final exam will be made up of application based
questions. This type of test allows the student to apply what they have
learned in class.  
Guest Speakers

During the course of the semester we will be having guest speakers come in to
discuss their area of recreation. Students will be responsible to take notes
during the presentation. The day after each presentation a review paper of the
presentation is due. In that paper should be the highlights of the
presentation, what you thought of the speaker, and if you are/are not
interested in this segment of recreation. Material discussed by a guest
speaker may be on the exams and tests.

    * David Touretzky, [Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/LispBook/index.html) (entire book downloadable from this Web site!). An excellent introduction to Common LISP with lots of clear explanation and exercises with solutions.

    * Guy L. Steele, Jr., "Common Lisp: The Language", Digital Press, 1990, ISBN 1555580416. You don't necessarily have to buy this book: there is also an [ on-line version](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/cltl2.html).  

## Course Description

**General statement.** This course is an introduction to computational
linguistics. It assumes some basic familiarity with linguistics concepts and
requires the ability to program. We will be covering traditional foundations
of computational linguistics areas such as finite-state methods, context-free
and extended context-free models of syntax, parsing, and semantic
interpretation; basics of more recent corpus-based and stochastic methods such
as n-gram models, hidden Markov models, probabilistic grammars, and
statistical methods for word sense disambiguation; and some selection of
application areas from among such topics as information retrieval, machine
translation, computational psycholinguistics, and computational lexicography.
Concepts taught in class will be reinforced in practice by hands-on
programming assignments.

## Course Requirements

  1. **Exercises.** Students will turn in (a) a program listing, and (b) a trace of the code working successfully. Students are encouraged to work together, but every assignment must contain one of the following statements: 

    1. I completed this assignment solo. 
    2. I collaborated to a small extent with [name(s)] on this assignment. 
    3. I collaborated extensively with [name(s)] on this assignment. 

  2. **Programming projects.** These will be larger in scope than the exercises, and may or may not be distributed with solutions. Students may choose to collaborate as for the exercises, but each module or subroutine must identify a single primary author, to be agreed upon by the collaborating students. 

  3. **Exams.** The course will have a mid-term exam and a final exam, with no final programming project. 

_Grading in the course will be based on 60% for the exercises and programming
projects and 20% each for the midterm and final._

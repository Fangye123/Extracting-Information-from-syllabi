Welcome to History 597A!  
  
This course explores a wide range of writings on colonialism and culture, each
very broadly defined. Because the course is conducted in an Anglophone
setting, much, but by no means all, of the scholarship represented here
concerns itself with the British empire. We will consider multiple dimensions
of the encounters and relationships between culture and imperialism, shifting
focus from the metropolitan "center" to the imperial "periphery" and
attempting to join the two ends of this spectrum together to understand them
in dynamic connection rather than as discrete or neatly bounded domains of
history and social interaction. One of our purposes, then, is to question the
traditional boundaries of imperial history, whether they be those maintained
by Europeanists, Africanists or Asianists.  
  
Another is to investigate the methodologies and evidence employed by scholars
as they examine their interests and promote their points of view. The readings
demonstrate a variety of methodological approaches to the history of
imperialism, and they should cause you to reflect not only on what you feel
are more and less effective means of approaching the topic at hand, but how as
scholars yourselves you can modify or combine disparate approaches in your own
work. Are disciplinary boundaries artificial?  
  
Finally, this is a course in historiography [American Heritage Dictionary
definition: 1. The principles or methodology of historical study. 2. The
writing of history. 3. Historical literature). What this means is that our
task is to grapple with a range of what has been said and what is now being
said about culture and imperialism. In contradistinction to the dictionary, I
define historiography in a broad manner to encompass scholarly writings across
a variety of disciplines. The core readings in the course are written by
historians, but we will also encounter engagements with literature, classics,
anthropology, feminist theory, ethnomusicology, and to some extent, geography.
Most of the scholarship we will read is quite recently published, but we will
not only be reading the newest and the hottest of literatures. Our task is to
explore a wide variety of ways in which scholars have conceptualized and
written about culture and imperialism, to investigate important moments of
creativity, and to discern the strands of debate which follow through
differing paradigms of thinking and writing about imperialism, colonialism and
the postcolonial condition.  
  
**Course Requirements**  
1\. Reading. All the reading listed in the syllabus is required and must be
completed by the class period for which it is assigned. Readings comprise both
books (texts available at the Penn State Bookstore) and articles or chapters
in journals and books. All reading material will be available at Pattee
Library Reserve Reading room. Additionally, the professor will make one
photocopy of each week's article/chapter reading available for easy
photocopying. This resource must considerately shared.  
  
2\. Attendance. Attendance is mandatory. If for some drastic reason you are
not able to attend class, you must notify the professor before hand. If the
timing is bad to reach me in person (you are welcome to call me at home) you
can leave a message on my answering machine at the office which is on 24 hours
a day. Absences will not do you well.  
  
3\. Participation in seminar discussions. The essence of a seminar is informed
discussion. Since participation constitutes a significant proportion of your
grade for the course, I heartily encourage you to talk at all costs!  
  
4\. Leading a seminar. Each participant will take responsibility for
leading/facilitating a seminar discussion. This requires a thorough reading of
the weeks' material and the preparation of ideas and questions which can be
raised to stimulate discussion. Although the professor may act as a sort of
co-moderator for the session, you will be expected to keep the discussion
going if it begins to lag and to be responsible for keeping it from straying
too far from the topic at hand.  
  
5\. Seven minipapers which discuss and analyze the readings for each of seven
course sessions. The papers are to be about 5 pages long, typed, double-
spaced. Consider the following questions as you write your papers. What are
the arguments of the author(s)? Why are the arguments and approaches
significant (or insignificant)? What are the strengths and weaknesses of the
works? How might the ideas be fruitfully utilized or modified? How are these
writings situated in a broader historiographical field? The papers are due at
the beginning of class for the sessions you chose to write for. You may chose
which seven sets of course readings to write about.  
  
6\. A research or historiographical paper of 15-20 pages on a topic of your
own selection, in consultation with the professor. I will give you significant
leeway in formulating your project. If you have a special idea which does not
seem to fit within these guidelines, please speak to me and we might be able
to work something out for you. The paper or project must be completed by
Friday of the last week of classes.  
  
**Grading and Evaluation**  
All written work will be evaluated on existence and clarity of argument as
well as adherence to length guidelines. Be succinct and don't overwrite. It's
too much work for both you and the professor to slog through many more pages
than required. Further, all written work will be assessed for grammar,
spelling syntax, as is normal for history graduate courses.  
  
A point system will be used for calculating grades:  
  
Attendance, Participation, Facilitation 300  
Short papers (50 points each) 350  
Research/Historiographical Paper 350  
  
Total possible points 1000

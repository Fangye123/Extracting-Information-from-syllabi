Course description

This course will be an introduction to some of the major figures in ancient Greek philosophy: Plato, Aristotle, the Cyrenaics, Epicurus, the Stoics, and the academic skeptics.  We will examine their metaphysics, epistemology, philosophy of mind, ethics, and political philosophy. 
Class format

This class will primarily be seminar format, and class discussion of the readings will play a major role. The midterm and final exam will consist of take-home essay questions; there will be frequent short reading response papers, and a longer final paper that the student will have the option of revising and resubmitting.

I will rotate the schedule of reading response papers, so that every class period one or two students will submit a paper. These papers will typically involve setting out and evaluating one of the arguments in the reading for that class day. You will post this paper to the class bulletin board.  Please post your paper the night before the class by 5 p.m. at the latest. Everybody will be responsible for reading the reading response papers before the class meeting and posting a reply to one of the papers, or a reply to one of the replies, even. 

You can post several types of replies:


Clarification request. You claim p, but I don't know what you mean by saying p. Please clarify. Do you mean by this p', p''...?
Argument request. You claim p. I think I know what you mean by p. But why do you claim p? I don't see any argument for p, and I think you need to give an argument for it.
Objection. You claim p (and maybe you argue for it). However, I think that p, (or your argument for p), is problematic. Here's my objection to p (or to your argument for p): q. What do you say in response to q?
Assistance. You claim p. I agree with you that p, but I think the following additional reason (which you do not mention) can be given in support of p: q.
Competing interpretation. You say that the reading claims that p. However, I don't think that this is exactly what it says. Instead, I think it says p' (and here's why I think this).
Suggestion of parallels. You claim p. P (or your argument for p) reminds me of so-and-so's claim that q (or his argument for q). Are the two really similar? Does comparing p to q help illuminate p, or is it just misleading?



Sometimes, the bulletin board may be down. If so, please e-mail me your paper or question before class.

Typically, I will explain the material in the first half of the class. We will take a break, and then the second half of the class will be devoted to discussing the material, using the reading response papers and replies as a way to start the discussion. But this division is not meant to be hard and fast: discussions and evaluation will often break out during the first part of the class, and during the course of discussing the material in the second part, sometimes I may go back to clarify some points in the material.

The bulletin board also has a forum for posting questions about the material. If anything in the reading is unclear to you, or you have any other questions about the material, please post them in this forum. I will look over it before class, and knowing what questions you have will help me prepare more effective lectures.

The bulletin board, announcements, copies of this syllabus, and a trove of other information is available from the course web site,

NOTE ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:

If any student plagiarizes in writing a paper--that is, copies or closely paraphrases from a source without proper quotation and acknowledgment of the source--then that student will be given a failing grade either on the paper or in the course.   I will discuss proper
footnoting procedures in class.


University Grading Standards
A   achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary
     to meet course requirements.
B   achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet
      course requirements.
C   achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.
D   achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet
     fully the course requirements.
S   achievement that is satisfactory, which is equivalent to a C- or better.
F (or N)   Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the
          work was either (1) completed but at a level of achievement
          that is not worthy of credit or (2) was not completed and
          there was no agreement between the instructor and the student
          that the student would be awarded an I.
I   (Incomplete) Assigned at the discretion of the instructor when,
    due to extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student
    is prevented from completing the work of the course on time.
    Requires a written agreement between instructor and student.


Credits and Workload Expectations

For undergraduate courses, one credit is defined as equivalent to
an average of three hours of learning effort per week (over a full
semester) necessary for an average student to achieve an average
grade in the course.  For example, a student taking a three credit
course that meets for three hours a week should  expect to spend
an additional six hours a week on coursework outside the classroom.
Accomodations for students with disabilities

It is University policy to provide reasonable accommodations to students
with disabilities.   Please contact the
instructor or the Disability Services office, 589-6178, Room 362 Briggs
Library to discuss accommodation needs.

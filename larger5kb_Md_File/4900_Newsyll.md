Ecology is an integrative and holistic science that embraces aspects of the
biological and physical sciences; some branches also involve mathematics,
philosophy, engineering, or economics. In this course we will focus on the
physical and biological aspects of ecology. Initially we will examine a
general approach to interpreting the complex environmental systems surrounding
us. Next we will study the physical factors that structure our global
ecosystem. We will attempt to place this within a historical context because
it is a philosophical assumption of this course that history matters. This
course also assumes that context matters and that causation exists.

We will approach the study of ecology in a hierarchical fashion. After
studying global physical factors, we will study landscapes composed of
interacting ecosystems. After our study of landscapes, we will study flows
within ecosystems.

To begin our study of community ecology we will study interactions of
communities of organisms. In our study of interactions we will not only study
different types of direct interactions such as predation, we will also study
properties conferred by complex networks of interactions. We will continue our
study of community ecology by examining species distributions and diversity.
We will also move away from a static view of community ecology and try to give
our study a dynamic perspective within spatial and temporal contexts.

Our next topic will involve population biology. After examining the dynamics
of simple populations, we will examine interacting populations within a
complex landscape. In a brief overview of evolution, speciation, and
population genetics, we will learn how populations evolve in a dynamic world.
Finally, we will study how behavior and physiology help individual organisms
cope with and sometimes structure their environment.

I will attempt to highlight important principles through lecture and study
questions. You are, however, responsible for all materials covered in the
assigned readings.  
    


**Course Requirements:**

Text: Ricklefs and Miller 1999

Additional Readings: Announced in class and available on reserve

The lab will follow an investigative format. This course receives writing
credit. Each student will be responsible for writing a minimum of 12 pages of
text during the semester. Format of reports should follow that of the journal
Ecology. I will deduct points from the 35% of the grade based on writing at
the end of the semester for students who fail to meet the page requirements.
Students will be expected to dress appropriately for working in the field. I
may include questions based on the laboratory work in the regularly scheduled
exams.

Weekend field trips will be scheduled during the semester. Each student will
be expected to attend one or perform an alternative project. The alternative
project will in no way substitute for other assignments made during the
semester. Field trip performance will be evaluated on the basis of promptness,
preparedness, and participation. If you cannot attend either trip, see me and
I will assign your alternative project.  
    


**Office Hours:**  
Tuesday 8:30-9:30  
or by appointment.  
Room 219 , Phone: 745:6525, Email: Albert.Meier@wku.edu

Warning: There is a potential time delay in this system. I do not necessarily
check my e-mail daily.

I will remind you that because history matters and causation exists, behaviors
have consequences.  
    


**Grading Policy:**

A: 91-100 Represents excellent and creative work

B: 81-90 Represents good disciplined work

C: 71-80 Represents competent and acceptable work

D: 65-70 Represents passable work

F: 0-64 Represents failing work  
    


**Course Grade:**  
    
    
  **Task** |  % Grade | Date Due  
---|---|---  
Test 1 | = 15% | 26 Feb.  
Paper 1 | = 15% | 5 March  
|  |  
**Test 2** |  = 15% | 23 April  
Final | = 25% | 9 May.

Ecology is an integrative holistic subject. All tests and the final will be
comprehensive.

Please note that the grades represent my evaluation of your work and not of
you.

_Absences_ : If you miss lecture, get the notes from another student. If you
are going to miss an exam you should notify me before the exam is given. If
you have a documented, acceptable reason for being absent you will be allowed
a make-up. If chronic absenteeism develops I will initiate a system of in
class quizzes.

You are allowed one lab absence. Additional lab absences will result in a 10%
deduction from the total lab grade per absence.  


"Students with disabilities who require accommodations (academic adjustments
and/or auxiliary aids or services) for this course must contact the Office for
Student Disability Services, Room 445, Potter Hall.  
The OFSDS telephone number is (270) 745-5004 V/TDD. Please DO NOT request
accommodations directly from the professor or instructor without a letter of
accommodation from the Office for Student Disability Services."

_Assignments_ are due prior to lecture on the assignment due date. There will
be a 10% deduction per each day thereafter. I will not accept papers that are
more than 5 days late.

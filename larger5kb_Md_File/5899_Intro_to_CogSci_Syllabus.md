### General Course Description

     This course is designed to give you an overview of the questions that define the field of Cognitive Science, the conceptual and research tools that are used to investigate these questions, and some idea of the answers that seem to be emerging. Cognitive Science is a multidisciplinary field that has drawn, both historically and methodologically, from a number of older disciplines, most prominently philosophy, psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and linguistics. No background in any of these disciplines is assumed, and this course is intended to serve as an introduction, for both majors and nonmajors, to the unique approach to studying problems of mind, brain, and behavior that Cognitive Science represents. For students who go on to major in Cognitive Science, this course provides the intellectual perspective and tools that will prepare you for further Cognitive Science courses as well as for courses from other departments needed to fulfill major requirements. For non-majors, the course is meant to offer a new way of thinking about mind and behavior that can spill over into other courses you take. 

### Reading Assignments

     The reading assignments for this course refer to the required texts. One of the texts is a compendium of relevant papers. Unlike most other disciplines, Cognitive Science does not yet have a good introductory textbook, so we need to use books that do not lend themselves easily to being carved up for the convenience of a course syllabus. For most of our books, the authors hoped that you'd read their books in the usual way, from cover to cover. Listed here are the sections in these books that are most relevant for particular topics, and you should be careful to do the relevant reading by the appropriate time, but, to enjoy them more fully, you may want to try to read through them in the more usual way, pacing yourself during the semester so as to not to become overloaded. 

The attached course outline shows the schedule of topics and assigned readings
for each class meeting. I have tried not to assign as much reading for
Thursday as for Tuesday. It is very important to do the readings which have
been assigned for a given class before the class. Much of class time will be
spent discussing, clarifying, and interrelating the material and issues
covered in the assignments, and understanding and integrating diverse readings
will be all the more difficult if you haven't read them. Lectures and
discussion will often go well beyond the readings but will always require them
as background.

### Course Requirements

     Everyone is expected to attend class regularly, complete assigned readings on time, and hand in assigned work on time. If you do have a legitimate and important reason for missing class or handing work in late, you should make every effort to contact me in advance about it. 

You will be responsible for completing two categories of written work, both of
which are spread out over the semester: papers, and quantitative exercises.
The papers consist of three short ones and a longer, [final paper](final-
paper.html) which constitutes the final exercise for the course. The short
papers contribute 10% each to the course grade, while the final paper counts
30% and will be flexible in topic. Three quantitative exercises will
collectively account for 28% of the course grade. See the syllabus for due
dates. The final component of the course grade is participation, which counts
for 12%. We will all get more out of this course if people are prepared for
class and actively engaged with the material, which can be demonstrated by
talking in a thoughtful and serious way in class or in individual meetings.

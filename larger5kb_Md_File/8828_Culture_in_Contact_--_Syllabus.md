>

> _Requirements_ : Grades will be assigned on the basis of class
participation, three exams, and twelve short assignments. There are two
midterm exams and a final exam. Each of the exams will count for 20% of your
final grade. All of the exams will include multiple choice, identification,
map, and essay questions covering material from the readings, lectures, and
class discussions. The final exam will not be comprehensive. Together the
short assignments count for 30% of your grade. Typically these assignments
will be handed out or discussed (several of them will be web-based) on
Thursdays and due the following Thursday. Your grade will be based on the ten
assignments with the highest grades; the lowest two assignment grades will be
dropped (so if you miss two of these assignments, you will not be penalized).

>

>> short assignments | 30%  
>> ---|---  
>> first exam | 20%  
>> second exam | 20%  
>> attendance and class participation | 10%  
>> final exam | 20%  
>> total | 100%  
>  
> The remaining 10% of your grade will be given for attendance and class
participation. This includes class attendance and your handing in short
answers to questions raised by the reading. These will be handed in most
Tuesdays. The questions will be handed out the previous Thursday, so you will
have to do the week's reading by Tuesday.

>

> _[Obligatory threatening passages]_

>

> Students who miss exams without notifying the professor (471-0057), or the
Office of the Department of Anthropology (471-4206) _in advance_ will, under
most circumstances, not be allowed to take the exam and will forfeit that
portion of their grade. If you do not hand in a short assignment on the day it
is due, you may hand it in the next class period. After that, the assignment
will not be accepted without an adequate written explanation. Attendance and
class participation make up part of your final grade, and so you would do well
to consider it extremely important: roll will be taken and the exams will
cover both the reading material and our discussions in class.

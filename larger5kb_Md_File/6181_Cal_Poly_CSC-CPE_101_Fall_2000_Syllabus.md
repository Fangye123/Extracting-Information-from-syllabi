###  _Course Structure, Computing Facilities, and Other Resources_

**Classroom meetings:**

     3 one hour classes per week
  
**What the instructor will do:**  
Discuss topics about readings assigned from textbook, go over examples, lead
class in learning exercises, explain and discuss program and lab assignments,
answer questions.  
**What the students should do:**  
Read, study, and take notes on the assigned pages from the textbook, watch and
listen to the class discussion, **take notes (written in a notebook!)** , ask
questions, answer instructor's questions, perform in-class exercises. Class
meetings are designed for students to **_actively participate_** , not to just
sit and listen passively.  **Computer Labs:**

     3 one hour labs per week. See details below under Required Course Work.
**Other Cal Poly Computer Facilities:**

     **This course requires a substantial amount of computer work to be done outside of lab on your own time.** You may do that work on any computer you wish: your own PC, [CSC Dept CSL labs](http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/resources/) (after hours), [other campus PC labs](http://www.calpoly.edu/labs.computing.html), or the [campus Unix system](http://www.calpoly.edu/~ias/hp-unix-system/). Program assignments require use of a Java compiler and some assignments will also require use of the campus Unix system.
     Two other general access campus labs have Java installed. These are the [Kennedy Library PC Lab (PolyConnect, 35-115c)](http://www.calpoly.edu/~iaslabs/PolyConnect_hours.html) and the [Liberal Arts Bldg. PC Lab (10-128)](http://www.calpoly.edu/~iaslabs/la_hours.html) ([click here](http://www.calpoly.edu/~iaslabs/schedule_index.html) for lab locations and schedule). Java is installed on the campus Unix system (a slightly older version).
**Online info files** :

     All course handouts will be posted on the [class WWW home page.](http://www.csc.calpoly.edu/~hitchner/CSC101) Many files will be available for download from the WWW or Cal Poly's campus UNIX system, such as, program and data files for lab exercises and programming assignments.

###  _Required Course Work_

[**Textbook Readings** :](readingAssign.html)

     Textbook readings assigned for every class meeting are [posted online](readingAssign.html). **** Not all topics assigned in the readings will be discussed in class. Students are responsible for **_all topics_** in the reading assignments including those not discussed in class. Reading assignment web pages include suggested exercises, optional textbook readings, and a study guide that students may use for self study.
     **Students should read the textbook and do suggested exercises BEFORE each class!**
**[Computer Labs:](progAssign.html)**

     Weekly lab exercises provide **practice "doing"** the concepts presented in the readings and class and **preparation** to help you with the weekly programming assignments. Students **must work in teams of two** during lab. Assigned exercises are [posted online](progAssign.html#LabExercises). Lab exercises are due by end of each week (electronic turnin) and are graded.
**[Programming Projects:](progAssign.html)**

     After the first week there will be one programming project per week. Printed copies of the assignments are handed out in class and [posted online](progAssign.html#ProgramProjects). Programs must be turned in electronically for grading. Program compilation, execution, and testing will be run automatically by the turnin program. Examples of correct solutions to the assignments will be [posted online](progAssign.html#ProgramSolutions) after the due dates.  All program assignments require use of a Java compiler.
     **Programs must be done individually -- not with your lab partner!**
**[Quizzes, Exams, and Final Exam(s):](exams.html)**

     **2 quizzes** , **2 hour exams** , and a **final exam**.
  
**Quizzes** will be 20 **minutes** long, **exams 50 minutes** , and the
**final two hours** (3 hours available).  
Quizzes and exams are closed book, and they cover material up to and including
the previous class meeting. The final will be comprehensive. Study guides and
samples of quiz and exam questions will be [posted online](exams.html#samples)
before each exam.  
You must score at least a ** passing grade (60%) **on the **final exam ** to
**pass the course!**

###  _Course Administrative Policies_

**Grading:**

     2 Quizzes x 40 pts. each = 80 pts.
     2 Hour Exams x 100 pts. each = 200 pts.
     Final Exam = 200 pts.
     **ExamsTotal** = 480 points
  
       10 Weekly Lab exercises x 5 pts. each = 50 pts.
     8 Programming Projects = 100 pts.  (variable number of points per project)
     Lab Quiz = 20 pts.
     Lab Final Exam = 50 pts.
     **ProgrammingTotal** = 220 pts.
  
**GrandTotal** = 700 points  
       You must get a ** passing grade (60%)**on the **Exams Total,Programming Total, and both Final Exams** to **pass the course!**
     **Algorithm** for determining your final course grade:
     If ( **ExamsTotal** < 288 or **ProgrammingTotal** < 132 or **Lab Final** < 30 or **Final** < 120) then
  
         **FinalGrade** = "F"      Else
  
         **NormalizedGrade** = **GrandTotal** ¡Â 7.0           // a number between 0-100   
         **FinalGrade** = letter from table below using value of **NormalizedGrade** : 90 to 100 = A- and A  | 80 to 89 = B- thru B+  | 70 to 79 = C- thru C+   
---|---|---  
60 to 69 = D- thru D+  |   | below 60 = F (failing)  
  
     **     WARNING**: Students who receive a grade lower than C- in CSC 101 **CANNOT ENROLL in CSC 102!!!**
  
       Student grades for all work throughout the quarter and cumulative total points will be [posted online](exams.html#statistics) (password required).
**Assignment Due Dates and Late Work:**

  * **Lab exercises** for each week are due at or before the **end of each Friday lab**.
  * Lab exercises may be handed in after the due date, though a grading penalty will be deducted.
  * **Programming projects** are due **by the hour and day stated on each assignment requirements document**. Read each assignment handout for the actual due date and time.
  * **Late program assignments will not be accepted after the due date**. A solution for all programming assignments will be posted online after the due date. **Partially complete assignments** handed in on time will be accepted without a late penalty and will receive partial credit. Thus, handing in an incomplete "something" on time will be better than handing in "nothing". **If you think you may have a problem meeting a due date,[contact the instructor](mailto:lhitchne@calpoly.edu) as soon as possible ahead of time!**
  * Turnin of most lab exercises and all program assignments will be done electronically.

**Unauthorized Collaboration (aka Cheating):**

  
       **BE SURE TO READ THIS.**
     **Several students have received zeros on programs in previous quarters!**

  * Computer software professionals frequently work on projects as a group. As a student here at Poly and later on in your professional career you will often have need to work as a member of a team. In this course some work may be done as two students working together, and other work must be done individually.
    * Your **exams** and **quizzes** must be **_individual efforts_**.
    * Your **lab exercises** must be done as **_teams of two_**.
    * Your weekly **programming assignments** must be done **_individually_**.
  * All work must be documented with the author's name. A programming assignment that claims to be done individually and is discovered to be the work of more than one student will be considered **plagiarism**. The CSC Dept. has a computer program that can compare program files and reliably detect similarities among them. **Suspected plagiarism will result in a zero** on the project **for all students** (the one copied from as well as the copiers) and a request to **visit the instructor in office hours** for a discussion of how to resolve the problem and to reinstate the grade, if deserved. A second violation of this policy may result in handling by the [Campus Judicial Affairs Office](http://www.calpoly.edu/%7Esaffairs/csrja/index.html). This can lead to being **failed from the course** or being **dismissed from the university**. Instructors in CSC 102 are notified about students convicted of collaborating in CSC 101.
  * Students are expected to learn and abide by the principles of ethical use of computers as determined by the ACM (Assoc. for Computing Machinery) [Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct](http://www.acm.org/constitution/code.html), [Calif. state laws (see Penal Code Section 502)](http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate?WAISdocID=3378111917+0+0+0&WAISaction=retrieve), and federal laws.

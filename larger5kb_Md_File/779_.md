**_Description of the Course :_**

This course is a survey of European history from the Peace of Westphalia to
the outbreak of the French Revolution. During this period sweeping economic,
social, intellectual, and political changes overtook the continent and brought
Western civilization fully into the modern era.

We will focus on the movement from "crisis," which reigned during the
religious wars, to "stability," which even though it developed within the
various substructures of early modern society, is usually associated with the
growth of state power and control. This transition offered numerous
possibilities for creative change, but also gave rise to a critical spirit
that eventually demanded a substantial restructuring of society and the
assumptions on which it was based by the end of the eighteenth century
(perhaps a bit earlier for England). What were the major patterns of
development and how were unfolding tensions managed or resolved?

To achieve a more complete understanding of European history from 1648 to 1789
we will study not only the life and times of elites but of ordinary people as
well. As Carlo Ginzburg (via Bakhtin) contends, there is a circular movement
between dominant (elite) and subordinate (popular) cultures which ensures an
interrelationship where neither one fully subsumes the other.

The format of the course will consist primarily of lectures with frequent
discussions of readings, including primary sources, historiography,
philosophy, cultural studies, and art history/criticism. This mixture is
designed to develop critical and analytical abilities, and to encourage a
broader understanding of history as more than just a series of "events."

**_Class Requirements_** :

1.     Class Discussion: It is important to keep up with the reading assignments **before** each class meeting so as to make worthwhile discussions possible. Class participation is **required** and comprises 20% of your semester grade. This grade will be calculated in part by turning in at each class meeting a 2-to-3-paragraph summary of the main points of that day's reading (excluding Merriman), **including analysis**.  (You **must** be **present** in class to turn in a summary.)  The summaries must be typed.  Since class participation constitutes a significant portion of the final grade **attendance and informed participation are required. ** Quizzes may be given to assess reading comprehension. 

2.     Examinations:  There will be one mid-term examination on Thursday, February 28, consisting of short-answer questions, a map exercise, and essay, that will count for 20% of the total grade. You are expected to bring material from the lectures and readings into your answer. The final exam will be two essay questions (at least one of which will be cumulative) and constitute 40% of the overall grade. In all essays you are expected to set up a thesis, organize a clear answer and provide the details necessary to support it. **Please note that the final exam is scheduled for the Tuesday, April 30 from 1:15 to 3:45 pm. Make travel plans with this in mind.**

3.     Film Review Essay: Since the course will focus on the readings and introduce the historiography of the period, there will be a short paper assignment that will allow you to utilize your historical skills in interpreting visual representations of the early modern era. You need to choose a feature film that deals with the history of this period from the list appended to this syllabus. After viewing the film you are to write a review essay that will give an overview of content and an analysis of its historical value based on what you've learned in the course, and any extra related reading.

Use your critical skills to the fullest. Remember that a fictional film's
historical value could be greater than one "based on the facts," if it catches
the mood or mentality of the period well. A good example of this is _The Name
of the Rose_ , based on Umberto Eco's famous novel. This review should be 7-8
pages in length [double-spaced, 1" margins, 10-12 cpi], and any footnotes
should be according to the _Chicago Manual of Style_. **This assignment is due
Thursday, April 11** **th , and will make up 20% of the final grade**. **Any
late papers will result in the grade being lowered accordingly. Printer
mishaps are** **not an acceptable excuse.** **Have some fun with this!**

Office Hours:                 TuTh 3:30-4:30 pm, and by appointment

Grading Scale:                 A = 93-100 A- = 90-92 B+ = 88-89 B = 83-87 B- =
80-82  
                                      C+ = 78-79 C = 73-77 C- = 70-72 D+ = 68-69 D = 63-6   
                                       D- = 60- 62 F = under 60

An "administrative " F (0) is used for missed papers or examinations. If there
is a **real** emergency you **must** reach me **before** the scheduled date.
**To be fair, there are no exceptions! **

Students are expected to conduct themselves in accordance with the rules and
regulations of FAU as described in the undergraduate catalogue (see sections
"responsibility and discipline" and "academic irregularities"). Mature and
responsible behavior in the classroom is required at all times. Tardiness,
excessive absences, inattentiveness, incivility, cheating, plagiarism, and/or
other unacceptable conduct may result in a failing course grade, suspension,
or expulsion from the university. If you have any questions about what
constitutes cheating or plagiarism, please come and talk to me. Ignorance is
not an acceptable excuse!

This course aims to provide a basic framework for understanding the early
developments that shaped the western world as we know it. In addition to
learning about historical themes and events in the period before 1660,
students will be introduced to historical analysis by reading and interpreting
original documents.

Our approach to historical analysis in this course will center on the document
collection by Wiesner, Ruff, and Wheeler, _Discovering the Western Past_. The
textbook by Noble et al., _Western Civilization: The Continuing Experiment_ ,
will provide us with background information for making sense of the source
documents, which form the building blocks for historians' reconstructions of
the past. Our efforts will be concentrated mainly on interpretation of the
sources, but we will need a solid grasp of the facts in order to interpret the
texts intelligently. (Please note that the reading in both of these books is
required.) In addition to these two books, which we will use throughout the
semester, we will be reading Thomas More's _Utopia_.

### Books:

Noble et al., _Western Civilization: The Continuing Experiment - Brief
Edition_  
Wiesner et al., _Discovering the Western Past_ , Vol. I  
More, _Utopia_

### Written Assignments:

Three essay exams in class  
Regular in-class quizzes  
3-5 page paper  
Final exam  
There may also be short assignments to be written either at home or in class.

### Classroom Requirements:

Reading assignments are due by the first class meeting of the week unless
otherwise noted (and except for the first week of class). Regular attendance
and participation are required and will be considered in the computation of
grades. Unless otherwise specified, please bring books to class, as we will
often be referring to them.

Note that students at the college level are responsible for mastering textbook
material on their own; classes will not duplicate or substitute for the
required reading. Rather, classes will make use of the readings to explore
issues in more depth. Students cannot succeed in this course by coming to
class without doing the reading, or by doing the reading but not coming to
class.

Students in this class will be grouped in teams early in the semester. The
teams will work periodically on group learning tasks in class and will also
work together on the group phase of quizzes.

### Grades:

Grades will be assigned on a scale of A, A-, B+, etc., and will be based on
the essay exams (15% each) paper (20%), final exam (20%), quizzes (20%), and
class participation (10%).

For the series of in-class exams, I will drop the lowest grade from the final
grade computation. Students who miss an essay will receive an 'F' for that
one; I will not give make-ups except in highly unusual circumstances (e.g.
medically-documented illness that causes a student to miss two of the three
exams). Thus a student who misses one exam will miss the full benefit of the
low-grade-dropping policy; a student who misses more than one will have an 'F'
figured in. (Note: the dates for these are tentatively marked on the syllabus,
but they may change, so you will need to listen for announcements.)

The regular quizzes will include both an individual and a team component: each
student's score will be based 75% on individual performance, 25% on team
performance.

Fall 2000  
History 3083  
Civil War and Reconstruction  
in the United States

This course is a study of the political, economic, social, constitutional, and
military development of the United States from 1848-1877.

Required Texts:  
James M. McPherson, _Ordeal by Fire  
_ James M. McPherson, _For Causes and Comrades  
_ George C. Rable, _Civil Wars  
_ Also required: access to the internet

The grade for each student will be determined in the following manner:

30% 2 tests  
20% Final exam  
20% Research Paper  
20% 4 response papers  
10% Class Participation

COURSE STRUCTURE and CLASS PARTICIPATION  
Discussion and dissection of assigned readings will serve as the center for
class meetings, so preparation, attendance and participation in discussion is
mandatory. Although there will be occasional presentations or lectures, we
will usually conduct the class much like a seminar, wherein discussion and
dialogue rather than monologue and lecturing characterize the class. Student
participation in discussion is REQUIRED and will figure as 10 percent of each
student's final grade. An exception to the rule of participation will apply if
any one or a small number of students begins, for whatever reason, to
monopolize student response. Independent thinking is highly encouraged as long
as it is informed thinking--that is, thinking informed by credible sources
(your readings, for instance)--but especially as long as diplomacy, respect,
and tact govern its sharing and expression. Because the emphasis in this class
is on collaborative learning and discussion, attendance is mandatory and will
count as a significant portion of the class participation grade.

TESTS  
Tests will constitute one-half of each student's final grade in the course.
Two tests (indicated on the assignment schedule below) will cover material
only since the last test. The final exam will be at given at the time
scheduled by the university for exams and will be comprehensive.

RESPONSE PAPERS  
Students will also turn in four response papers (see schedule below for due
dates). These papers will be one page typed or two pages handwritten responses
to questions or topics handed out in class one week prior to the due date.
Each of these papers will be based upon the readings assigned for class and on
class discussions. Response papers turned in after the due date will be
counted off one letter grade (10 points) every 24 hours late.

RESEARCH PAPER  
One research paper based on PRIMARY documents will be due on November 27 on
any topic approved by the instructor. This paper should be 10-15 pages TYPED
and include footnotes or endnotes in the Chicago Manual style. Further details
of the research paper will be discussed in class. Students will have several
assignments related to the paper prior to the final paper due date. Each of
these assignments MUST be completed and/or turned in on time or one-half of a
grade (5 points) will be deducted from the final grade on the research paper.
Students MUST attend the Research Paper Workshop scheduled during class time
on September 6 and MUST also attend the paper draft exchange on November 17.
More information regarding the research paper will be discussed in class.

**Attendance and Participation:**  
Your participation grade depends on your participation in discussions and on
your attendance in class. You are allowed **three** excused absences for
emergencies and illness. Beyond this limit, each absence will reduce your
participation grade by five points. You are expected to be on time for each
class. Changes in the syllabus and announcements for the class will be given
at the beginning of class. It is your responsibility to ensure that you know
about all changes on the syllabus.

**Late Assignments:**  
Two points will be deducted from assignments for every day that they are late.
If your paper or assignment is going to be late, you need to inform me before
the assignment is due.  
  
**Short Assignments:**  
You will be given several short assignments, which will be take-home
assignments, to be due as announced. Your examinations will be very similar to
the homework problems, so be sure to take these assignments seriously. These
assignments will be given out each Friday and will be due the following
Friday.  
  
**Examinations:**  
The examinations will be in class tests. The exams will be very similar to the
homework given in class, so please take these assignments very seriously.  
  
**Group Project:**  
As part of your final grade, you will present a group oral report to the class
on some aspect of English grammar. More details about this will be given
throughout the course. You will also be given time in class to prepare for
your report. You will be in groups of 4-5 students (so that there are between
7 and 8 groups in the class).  
  
**Preventing Sexual Harassment**  
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 prohibits sex discrimination
against any participant in an educational program or activity that receives
federal funds. The act is intended to eliminate sex discrimination in
education. Title IX covers discrimination in programs, admissions, activities,
and student-to-student sexual harassment. BYU's policy against sexual
harassment extends not only to employees of the university but to students as
well. If you encounter unlawful sexual harassment or gender based
discrimination, please talk to your professor; contact the Equal Employment
Office at 378-5895 or 367-5689 (24-hours); or contact the Honor Code Office at
378-2847.  
  
**Students With Disabilities**  
Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning
atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities.
If you have any disability which may impair your ability to complete this
course successfully, please contact the Services for Students with
Disabilities Office (378-2767). Reasonable academic accommodations are
reviewed for all students who have qualified documented disabilities. Services
are coordinated with the student and instructor by the SSD Office. If you need
assistance or if you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on
the basis of disability, you may seek resolution through established grievance
policy and procedures. You should contact the Equal Employment Office at
378-5895, D-282 ASB.

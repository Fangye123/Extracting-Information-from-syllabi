**This course is designed to examine and interpret major events and issues in
American foreign relations since World War I so that you can understand the
historical framework within which current American decision-makers operate.
Your studies should inspire critical examination of the motives and results
characterizing US foreign relations. You should exit this course with a better
understanding of:**

> **1) the basic principles motivating American foreign policy (including
security, prosperity, & "morality") & how Americans reconciled frequent
contradictions arising thereby;**

>

> **2) the impact of America's late 19th-century transition from continental
expansionist to Imperial Power.**

>

> **3) America's rise to global power and the internal & external limits
placed upon its exercise;**

> **4) America's ideological responses to others' revolutions;**

>

> **5) the myths & realities of American "isolationism;"**

>

> **6) the importance of individuals & irrationality in history;**

>

> **7) the impact of several key "internal" issues upon foreign policy
decisions, including domestic electoral politics, racism, & the desire for
external commerce;**

>

> **8) & Cold War issues & historiographical debates: Who started the Cold
War? Who won the Cold War? Why did it last so long?**

**_Note: Prior basic familiarity with 20th Century US history is essential._**

**Required Texts:**

**Thomas Paterson, J. Clifford, K. Hagan, _American Foreign Relations: A
History Since 1895_. 5th ed., 2000**  
**Paterson & Dennis Merrill, _Major Problems in American Foreign Relations,
Volume II: Since 1914_. 5th ed., 2000.**

**Reading assignments (see Course Schedule below) are directly linked to class
lectures & discussions; _get ahead and STAY ahead!_ As current policy
questions arise, class time will be devoted to brief discussions of events in
their historical context.**

**_Grading Policy_**

**Your grade will be calculated based on the following in regard to a scale of
650 points. PROMPT COMPLETION OF WORK IS VITAL.   Scale:**  
92-100% = A     90-91% = A-     88-89% = B+     82-87% = B      80-81% = B-
78-79% = C+  
  72-77% = C     70-71% = C-     68-69% = D+     62-67% = D      59-61% = D-
58%     = F

_1) 2 exams_ :  **June 26 and July 10**. **Each** will be worth **150 points**
, & will test your knowledge of US foreign relations 1) 1914-1941/1945, and 2)
from 1941-@ 1963\. Any change in exam date will be announced as far in advance
as possible. Each exam will consist of essay questions addressing major topics
& issues discussed in class _& **IN THE READINGS**_.   There will be matching
& multiple-choice questions designed to reinforce my insistence upon the need
for close attention to lectures, texts, and historiographical issues. You must
provide "blue books" **in advance** for _each exam_ , & are expected to sit
for each examination as scheduled. Please turn in 5 blue books by Friday, June
22.

_2) A final exam_ (July 20, worth **200 points** ) will test your knowledge of
US foreign relations since 1914; comprehensive questions will appear. It may
become a take-home exam (students will be consulted).

3) _Class participation_ , which will count for **50 points** , is essential.
This scoring category is intended to ensure that you do the reading & come to
class. Class sessions will typically consist of lecture & discussion, for
which REGULAR **attendance** and ACTIVE **participation** (involvement in
discussion) is EXPECTED, for which PRIOR completion of the reading is vital.
Quality  & quantity of participation are equally important. Excessive
absenteeism _will be costly_. To ensure prompt completion of reading, pop
quizzes may be administered unexpectedly. Such quizzes may occur at any time
that I have reason to believe that the class is not making satisfactory
progress in keeping up with the reading.   Quizzes' grades would count toward
and be included in the participation grade of 50 points. This approach is
designed to ensure that you will not be attempting to do all the reading just
before the exams.

(4) _Paper:_ HISTORIOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS OF WEBSITES/PRINT SOURCES **(100
points possible** )

  * The assignment will be due **July 17 at 9 am (** when I check my e-mail)
  * Format: Your assignment should be mailed to me as an e-mail attachment (saved in HTML if possible, in Word if necessary; print versions will be accepted), must be **well written** (clearly argued, accurate, specific & organized) **& PROOFREAD, with an introduction that describes the controversy and outlines your conclusions. ** (Save a copy: always save everything in case my computer cannot read your materials)
  * **Assignment: _Does the "web" provide in-depth or superficial analysis of historical events_? Familiarize yourself with a historiographical controversy in the history of 20th Century American diplomacy (some examples are listed below) that is discussed in 2-4 historical _monographs_ or comparable printed literature (seminal _articles)_ \--find articles if you can, and consult book reviews of books that summarize authors' views. Consult your texts' EXCELLENT bibliographies at the end of each chapter for the best books on given topics; consult with me as well. Summarize the positions held by these leading historians. Describe 3-4+ contrasting websites that offer analysis of the relevant events (some links to sites are available below; others are linked in course outlines). Evaluate their contribution to the controversy and their representation of it.**
  * GUIDELINES FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT:
    * **Select reputable sources** (or clearly indicate whether and why a source is not reliable). .edu , .gov, .com, .us, and .org sites CAN BE   very useful. If an expert authority has written the page or is extensively cited within, what are his/her credentials? Are they one of the scholars who has published printed materials on the subject--or a student of theirs?  Is there obvious (or subtle) bias in the source? Ensure that your sources offer DIFFERENT interpretations of the key issue(s) raised by your subject.
    * Introduce the subject in an introductory paragraph. Specify and briefly explain the key points of controversy.
    * (Provide URLs for each site & be sure that the link works.)
    * E-mail me by July 2: your topic, your 2+ books/articles, and your websites. **_This step is essential._**
    * Briefly describe the content found at each site (newspaper articles, cartoons, photos, speeches, maps, government documents...)
    * Evaluate each site. Go beyond generalities. Discuss:
      * Analytical Framework: You must choose sites that go beyond mere listing of facts to provide substantive analysis that will enable you to understand the information gained there. Did each of the sites that you chose do so? Did they offer scholarly approaches? Which one did you think had the best analytical approach? Can you categorize it in terms of the historiographical viewpoints we have discussed in class?
      * Context: how did the information or viewpoint presented compare with that presented at other sites and with that presented by your instructor, your textbooks, or (especially) the printed monographs you found? Was what you learned at odds with or in harmony with what you learned from printed sources (--be sure to demonstrate your grasp of the controversy in printed sources)?
      * Contribution: Evaluate the contribution this site makes. Does it point readers to a deeper understanding of the issues, or does it sensationalize a controversy? Does it deal fairly with various viewpoints? Does it point readers to reliable printed sources? Does the site capitalize upon multimedia capabilities to provide some benefit that a printed source cannot?
      * Conclusion: Is this topic's "web presence" sufficiently sophisticated? Would you feel comfortable as a citizen or a teacher in pointing students to the sites you have found to achieve an initial or in-depth understanding of the topic?
    * Possible topics: (Refer to books cited in texts' bibliographies for possible topics **.** Be sure to choose something or someone that is historically significant enough so that you can find contrasting sites, such as:)
      * American "neutrality" in World War One
      * U.S. warmaking decisions: for example, [why did we enter World War One,](http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1917/wilswarm.html) why did we fight in Vietnam, or [did we make the correct decisions in fighting the Korean Conflict](http://www.thehistorynet.com/MHQ/articles/2000/summer00_text.htm)?
      * Wilson's handling of the peace negotiations to conclude World War One (Versailles Treaty)
      * U.S. policy toward Latin America: the Good Neighbor Policy, the Alliance for Progress...
      * U.S. policy toward Middle Eastern crises
      * U.S. policy toward a specific nation, e.g. diplomatic recognition (Cuba, China).
      * U.S. "isolationism" between the wars (e.g. should America have [boycotted the Berlin Olympics?](http://www.ushmm.org/olympics/))
      * Pearl Harbor
      * The Second Front Controversy in World War Two (leading to [D-Day)](http://gofrance.about.com/travel/gofrance/library/weekly/aa020899.htm?once=true&)
      * the decision to drop the atomic bomb: [for (1),](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/hamby.htm) [(2),](http://www2.h-net.msu.edu/~diplo/balp.htm) & [against (1), ](http://www.doug-long.com/)[(2)](http://www.doug-long.com/debate.htm)
      * responsibility for the origins of the Cold War: [1](http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/), [2](http://cwihp.si.edu/default.htm),
      * aspects of the nuclear arms race
      * evaluation of crucial Cold War decisions & events: Yalta, Marshall Plan, Cuban Missile Crisis
      * management of foreign policy dissent, e.g. [Creel,](http://www.thehistorynet.com/MilitaryHistory/articles/12955_text.htm) McCarthyism, the [Alger Hiss Case](http://www.thehistorynet.com/AmericanHistory/articles/1998/0698_text.htm) & Venona
      * who won the Cold War?
      * who ended the Cold War: [Reagan](http://www.heritage.org/heritage25/lectures/dec97/thatcher.html) or Gorbachev?

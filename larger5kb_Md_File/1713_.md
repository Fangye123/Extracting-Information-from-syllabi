**_Course Objectives_** :   This course is a one semester survey of the
history of Western art (European and American) from the Renaissance to the
contemporary period.  The style and meaning of works of art and architecture
will be analyzed and discussed, and the works will be placed in their social,
historical, and aesthetic contexts.  The student will develop a command of
significant works of Western art, discover how artists throughout the
centuries have communicated matters such as religious beliefs, social
concerns, and/or personal expression in visual terms, and gain skill in
writing and speaking about works of art.  
    
**_Course Requirements_** :  
Required Text:  All reading assignments are in Marilyn Stokstad _Art History_
,  Revised Edition Volume Two, 1999.  You will also need the Study Guide by
Ida Katherine Rigby for the revised edition, which should have been bundled
with the text.   NOTE:  These texts supplement, but do not substitute for the
material presented in lectures.

**_Exams and Grades_** :  Students are responsible for material covered in
lectures, readings from the text, participating in discussion lists and in-
class discussion, and homework assignments.  Grades will be calculated as
follows:

    Midterm  (Mon. Feb. 28)                 =  30%   
    Final  (Wed. May 3)                        =  30%   
    Quizzes                                           =  25%   
    Class attendance and participation      = 15%
Grading Scale:  90-100 = A; 86-89 = B+; 80-85 = B; 76-79 = C+; 70-75 = C;
60-69 = D; 59 and below = F

Students are required to take both exams.  If an incredibly unusual or serious
circumstance prevents you from taking one of the exams, _an excuse from the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies is required_ to make up the exam. Make up exams
will be scheduled at the discretion of the instructor.  If no valid excuse is
provided, you will be given a zero for the exam.

**_Attendance_** :  Regular attendance is essential to the successful
completion of this course, because visual recognition of a number of works of
art is key to mastering the material.  Additionally, questions, comments and
discussion of the works presented in lectures are encouraged and expected,
which also requires your presence.  In the event of absence, the student is
responsible for gathering missed lecture material as well as announcements
and/or schedule changes.  _Attendance will be taken daily, and excessive
absences (4 or more) will adversely affect your attendance/participation
grade_.

**_Academic Honesty Policy_** :  Students are expected to uphold the Honor
System of the College of Charleston, as outlined in your student handbook,
pages 10-11.

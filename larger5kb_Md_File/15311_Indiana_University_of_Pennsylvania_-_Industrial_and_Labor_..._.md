LBST 499 Labor Relations: Hope or Hopeless?  
The picture of labor-management relations in America has often been blood red
and painful to behold. Why has this been so? What is the current state of the
relationship? Why is management so resistant to unions? Why do unions seem to
risk economic suicide by striking? What challenges face unions and
corporations as they end the twentieth century and begin the next? Who do the
unions actually represent? Can labor and management learn to cooperate? We
will draw on the disciplines of history, law, ethics, politics, economics, and
business to seek answers to these and other questions.

LBST 499 Pittsburgh: A City and Its People  
Pittsburgh during its two hundred year history was an incubator of modern

manufacturing center and its subsequent decline provides a rich subject for a
variety of approaches and perspectives. History, economics, technology,
political science, religion, literature, art, music, and architecture provide
windows on aspects of the story. The challenge is to grasp the underlying
unity of the evolution of a great city through facets revealed by specific
disciplines. This course will be particularly useful to anyone teaching,
working, or living in Western Pennsylvania.

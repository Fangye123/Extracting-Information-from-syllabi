**Course Description**

This is an introductory class on database system. It covers principles of
database systems, data modeling, relational models, database design, query
languages, query optimization, concurrency control and data security. In
addition, fundamentals on systems analysis and the database application
lifecycle will be reviewed. Available for the class are MS-ACCESS, SQL server
and Oracle 8i personal edition.  
.  
**Prerequisite  
**  
For ICS students: ICS 311 and 321  
For LIS students: Any of these courses: LIS647, LIS663, LIS670  
For other students: Instructor consent  

**Course Learning Objectives**

At the end of this course students will have learned database fundamentals,
including:  

1\. Basic data modeling principles  
2. General architecture for database systems - The ANSI-SPARC three level architecture (external, internal and conceptual level)  
3\. The relational model and languages  
4\. Phases of database design: conceptual, logical and physical database
design  
5\. The Entity Relationship (ER) model; UML notation  
6\. Concurrency control and data security

Students will also gain practical experience and will be able to:  
  
1\. Act as a contributing member of a database design team.  
2\. Apply various software tools for database design  
3\. Implement a database prototype which meets users requirements  
  
**Course Structure**

Class meetings will combine lectures, demos, exercises, assignments,
presentations and discussions. For each class session, students should have
completed the assigned readings, bringing questions and comments to the class.
There will be weekly exercises, minor assignments and quizzes. Early in the
semester students will form teams and actually get involved in a real - small
database project of their choice, which will start with requirement analysis,
followed by a prototype design and implementation. Each team will periodically
present progress reports. Final reports on your projects will be presented to
the class, both orally and in written form at the end of the semester. In
addition, students will participate in another team to explore a special topic
in database systems. The results of the special topic analysis will be
presented orally to the class.  
****Students will use WebCT to form teams and to complement class discussions.

Connolly, Thomas and Carolyn Begg. Database systems a practical approach to
design, implementation and management. 3rd. ed. Addison Wesley, 2002.

**Requirements**

Evaluation will be partly individual and partly team based, according to the
following formula:  
  

Class meetings and WebCT participation | 10%  
---|---  
Exercises, assignments, quizzes | 10%  
Midterm | 10%  
Special topic presentation (team) | 10%  
Course project: |  
| In progress project reports (team)  | 20%  
| Final project presentation (team) | 10%  
| Final project report (team) | 20%  
| Intra-team evaluations | 10%  
  
**Course project.** Students will work in a team (3-5 students) for the course
project during the whole semester and the final product will be a documented
database prototype. Students will identify a "client/user" with a problem that
can be at least partially solved with the creation of a database. Students
will meet the client in order to gather information to define the problem,
identify specifications, analyze data, and come up with a database solution.
Analysis of user needs and user-based design will be emphasized, what means
that the technical solution will have to be adjusted to the client
specification - requirements. Each team has to be ready to spend at least 4
hours per week working in the project. The "client" will have to be willing to
meet the students once per week facilitating their data collection and
discussing their ongoing, updated, proposals. Hopefully the client will be
actively involved as part of the design team. The **final project report**
should be similar to one which would actually be submitted to a client. It
should include an executive summary and a description of the problem,
requirements, specifications, limitations and the database solution. Modeling
tools, diagrams may also prove useful appendices.  
The appropriateness of the solution and its justification will be the primary
factors in grading. Clarity of expression (including proper use of English,
aptness of illustrations, logical organization, etc.) will also be of major
concern, and appearance (layout, font selection, paper, print quality,
binding, etc.) will also be taken into account). Projects will be presented
during the last two weeks of the class. Examples of[
projects](ics421SP02Projects.html) developed in other database classes will be
made available.  
**The paper is due on Friday, May 3, last day of instruction.  
**

The **special topics research** is intended to give an awareness of issues
such as alternatives and trends in database design, software tools available,
etc. Students will work in teams of 3-5 to analyze a selected special topic
and present the analysis results to the class, including software tool
demonstrations, as applicable. Students may find special topic information
useful in preparing the course project. Students will negotiate with the
instructor the schedule of presentations in order to find the time that will
better complement the class matters.  Instructor will make some suggestions of
possible[ topics](ics421SP02topics.html).  
  
**Technology requirements  
**

You will receive the software needed for the assignments or instructions for
downloading them to your own computers. Some of the tools will be available in
ICS computer lab and in the LIS computer lab.  
  
**Students with disabilities**

If you are a student with a special need as defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act, please feel free to discuss this with me at your earliest
convenience.  
  
**Course Schedule**

(The following schedule will not necessarily be strictly followed; however,
students are expected to have all assignments completed before the class
session unless otherwise instructed

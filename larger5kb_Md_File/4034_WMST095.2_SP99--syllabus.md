**Course Description**

The terms "global" and "globalization" may mean different things to different
people and in different contexts.  One goal of this course is develop
collectively an understanding of "the global" that allows for the complexities
of individual, community, national, and transnational experiences while
attending to the ways in which we are all socially, politically, economically,
and culturally linked to one another.  The concept of "gender" refers to
**_the historically changing and culturally/socially variable ways in which
differences between women and men are constructed by a society, become a
fundamental part of individual identity, are used to distribute (usually
unequally, usually in men's favor) social responsibilities, wealth, and
political rights, and become the basis for expectations about appearance,
sexual behavior, work roles, and so on.   _**This concept is at the center of
work within Women's Studies.  In this course we will discuss some of the ways
in which various processes of global change, of the intensification of
interconnectedness between individuals, communities, corporations, social
movements, etc, differently affect women's and men's experiences and well-
being.  We will also try to analyze how inequalities between women and men
influence how globalization is taking place.  Because neither all women nor
all men are the same, however, we will be constantly assessing how other
aspects of identity, including race, class, experiences of colonization,
nationality, and sexuality, influence and are influenced by global processes.
One goal will be to find ways to understand our own experiences, privileges,
oppressions, and perceptions in a "global" context -- where (and why and with
what effects) are we "located" today in relation to people living, working,
learning in other parts of the world? We will also talk about activism; we
will examine both local and transnational struggles to respond to inequalities
engendered by global change.  This course is reading and discussion-centered;
you are required to take an active part in the design and content of each
class meeting.  Pre-requisite: Women's Studies 50 or consent of the
instructor.

> **Attendance and Participation**  
> **Group Commentaries and Discussion-Leading**  
> **Short Research Paper Project**  
> **Forum Postings**  
> **Exams**  
> **Grading**

> **_Attendance and Participation_**  
>  This course is discussion-based and reading-intensive.  Attendance and
participation are, therefore, required.  You may have two absences (for any
reason) without affecting your grade (you alone are responsible for getting
any information, handouts, schedule changes, and notes that you miss).   Each
absence after that (for any reason) will result in a 10% deduction from your
participation grade.  I will make no exceptions without a written explanation
from a Dean.  Two late arrivals or early departures will count as one absence.
Participation means taking an active part in discussions by making intelligent
and relevant contributions based on the readings and on listening to what
others have said (it is not simply talking for the sake of talking!).  I will
periodically ask you to evaluate your own "participation" in the class and
will rely on your evaluations as well as my own observations to determine your
grade.  You can also participate by contributing more than is required to our
[on-line discussion forum](http://blackboard.unc.edu/courses/wmst081001s01).
I will also periodically ask you to do ungraded but required "free writing" in
class and at home; doing these seriously and handing them in will count
towards your participation grade.  In order to do well in this class you will
come having carefully done the readings and considered the discussion
questions and the student commentaries posted before class.  You are expected
to adopt a tolerant and actively questioning attitude: I expect you to ask
questions, share your understandings with your classmates, take risks, and
respect others' feelings and experiences. Please do not eat in class or allow
your cell phone to ring in class.

**_Group Commentaries and Discussion Leading_**  
Early in the semester, I will assign you to a small group.  Once during the
semester your group will lead the classroom discussion on the assigned
readings.  By noon on the day before class, your group will post a short
commentary and several discussion questions to our discussion forum.  In
class, your group will run the discussion by using the commentary and
discussion questions as a starting point.

**_Short Research Paper Project_**  
Early in the semester you will select a topic from a list that I will provide.
You will explore and report on this project in three different assignments: an
annotated bibliography, a [web site analysis and
review](http://www.unc.edu/courses/2001spring/wmst/081/001/webreview.html)
(that will be posted on-line), and a final 6 to 8 page paper.  I will post
guidelines for this project shortly.  If you want to do an topic that is not
on the list, you need to speak to me and get my permission in person (I will
not give permission over email). [Click here to see the guidelines for this
paper](http://www.unc.edu/courses/2001spring/wmst/081/001/paperguide.html)

> **_Forum Postings_**  
>  We will have three on-line "discussions" using the ["course info" web
site](http://blackboard.unc.edu/courses/wmst081001s01) for our course.  I will
provide a question and you will be required to post at least twice to the
forum in response to the question and to each other's responses for each
discussion.  See the [document (produced by UNC-CH's Center for Instructional
Technology) on "Course
Info"](http://www.unc.edu/cit/courseinfo/QS/studentinstructions.doc) for
information on how to access and participate in our forum. Some guidelines:
you will need to have an ATN onyen and password and you will need to be
properly registered for the class in order to access the course info site; you
will not be allowed to make anonymous postings; I will announce the forums as
I create them; and you will have a specified period of time in which to make
your required posts (you are always welcome to make additional postings).  I
will also post guidelines for making appropriate postings.

> **_Exams_**  
>  You will take two essay exams, a midterm and a final.  The questions  will
ask you to synthesize (bring together) the readings and discussions that we
have had.  The final exam will be cumulative.

> **_Grading_**  
> **_Failure to complete any one assignment, regardless of its point or
percentage value, is grounds for possible failure of the course._**  
>  Your final grade will be based on the following percentages: **_please note
the changes in red!_**

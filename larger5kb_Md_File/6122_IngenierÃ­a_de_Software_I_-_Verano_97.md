**Course description**

  
This course introduces fundamental concepts for Information Systems
development.  In particular, this courses focuses on Analysis and Design of
Information Systems using the Structured Analysis and Design techniques.

**Course policies**  
Class attendance will be verified randomly  Class participation will be
requested randomly in all the lectures.

  
Most of the material presented for this course is in ENGLISH. These notes are
only **support** for the ocurse.   It is the student responsability to update
the notes with the class discussion.  


**Course Objectives**

> **General Objective**

>  
>  At the end of this course students will know the general principles of
Information Systems. Students should be able to perform Analysis and Design of
Information systems using the Structured techniques.  Students will develop
communication and group work abilities.

>

> **Specific Objectives**  
>  1\. To know basic principles of Information Systems  2\. To know and
understand the Information Systems Life Cycle

> 3\. To know and apply techniques of Structured Analysis and Design to real
world system development

in the syllabus.  The second exam will be at the end of the course.

>

> b) [Project Design](projectV97.html) (35%).  
> Projects will be evaluated according to the quality, process and
development, as well as the final product.  The grade for the group will show
the quality of the application of Software Engineering concepts.  The grade is
the same for all the members of the team.

>

> Written report 15%

> Prototype generation 10%

> Use of CASE tools 5%

>  
> Oral presentation 5%  
>   c) Attendance and Participation (15%)

>  
> The participation in class indicates that the student has read the topics of
the class.  Attendance is evaluated randomly.  Participation is evaluated
randomly based on exercises, homeworks, and readings.

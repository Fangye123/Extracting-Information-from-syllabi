###  _Course Objectives_

####  _Preface:_   Who killed the "Peace Process?"  Whoever is responsible did
a thorough job.  The peace process, as limited and flawed as it was, seems
fairly dead.  The two-way street of violence raging in Israel and Palestine
since September 2001 is more apparent than are negotiations to end that
violence or return to a path of peace.  There is no element of trust between
Israelis and Palestinians or between Israelis and other Arabs; in the early
years of the peace process, at least until 1996, such a trust was evident.
After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the election of Benjamin
Netanyahu in 1996, the peace process began its quick path to an early death.
Perhaps this is a good thing after all . . . But why?

####  _Objectives:_   This course is designed to introduce students to the
dynamics of the Arab-Israeli Conflict (A.I.C.) and to demonstrate how this
conflict has come full circle. From the original clash between Zionism and
Arab-Palestinian nationalism, this conflict grew to an inter-state rivalry
between Israel and its immediate Arab neighbors even as it remained a
localized "civil" war between Israel and the Palestinians who live under its
occupation. The latter are now attempting to govern themselves in an emerging,
but ambiguous, autonomous region in unconnected parts of the Gaza Strip and
the West Bank.

####  Our discussions will pay special attention to the Conflict's historical
development and changing nature over the years; the role of outside powers
(Britain, the U.S., and the former Soviet Union especially) in contributing to
the conflict; and the consequences this conflict holds for regional and
international actors.

####  In this course, we will focus on the history, politics, and ethical
dimensions of the conflict as well as examine previous and on-going attempts
at resolving it. A variety of methods will be used to accomplish these tasks.
Through both individual and Team/group learning, much of your efforts will be
concentrated on:

  * Critical thinking and analysis (including observation and interpretation)
  * Team-learning and self-motivation
  * Negotiating, debating, and public speaking; and
  * Evaluation of your efforts and those of your colleagues.

####  This course is intended to be more than a passive experience on your
part, whereby you would just sit and listen to lectures. Instead, you will be
actively involved in the process of learning about the A.I.C. (1) by becoming
participants in a simulation of it and (2) through group discussions based on
_cases_.

####  **_The Simulation_ : _November 30 - December 1._    IF YOU CANNOT ATTEND
THIS WEEKEND, DO NOT TAKE THE COURSE**. In the simulation, you will take on a
role of one of the many actors involved in the A.I.C. (Yasser Arafat, King
Abdullah II, Ehud Barak, Madeleine Albright, etc.) and will actively pursue
that person's and his/her group's objectives regarding the Conflict.

####  _Communication_ is the key to this simulation and it will be conducted
by way of face-to-face negotiations, group meetings, "[Web-site
chats](http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/AIC-Sullivan)," and a week-end long
international gathering.  The week-end simulation is the culmination of our
efforts and is an absolute requirement.

####  As a first step, go to [www.yahoogroups.com/group/AIC-
Sullivan](http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/AIC-Sullivan).  Subscribe to our
classroom discussion group.  This will allow us all to be in touch with
important announcements, news items, updates on classroom assignments, and so
on.  If you want to set up additional discussion groups for this class, e.g.,
for your Country/Team (see below), do so.

####  The _Case Method_ of Instruction allows us to develop together as a
supportive learning community in the classroom. It requires students to Read,
Write, Speak, and Think. It requires the instructor to be even more attentive
to students than traditional (lecture-based) settings; much time is required
for class preparation, student assessment and feedback. So, we all have our
work cut out for us. Still, this method has proven to be popular among
students and faculty alike when it is engaged in seriously and effectively.

####  In this course, students are expected to develop skills in and
perspectives on: research, reading comprehension, critical thinking, ethical
reasoning, problem identification and analysis, group-work (i.e., "team-
work"), public speaking/oration, and writing.

_Grading_

####  _Country Profile_ (5 points), a 10-page survey of your chosen country.
This is a group effort written by all members of your Team/Country. It covers:
BRIEF history, economic system, politics (institutions, parties, ideologies,
ruling elites), demography and geography. _Submit 2 COPIES; 1 hard copy; 1
uploaded to Yahoogroup_

####  _Role Profile_ (10 points), a 3 page "autobiography" of the person you
are representing in the Simulation (e.g., Yasser Arafat, Ariel Sharon, King
Abdullah II). Written in the first person, this paper should be a sympathetic
and honest account of your personal and professional history. Also included in
this is an outline of who in the conflict is your friend/ally and who is your
enemy. _2 COPIES; 1 hard copy; 1 on Yahoogroup_

####  _"GOST" Paper: Goals, Objectives, Strategies and Tactics paper_ (5
points) is written either as a team or individually. It states the goals
(e.g., Palestinian statehood, Annexation of Jerusalem, economic pacts,
security arrangements) you want to achieve in the simulation and in the
conflict and it specifies the tactics/means (e.g., negotiations, arms deals,
alliances, demonstrations/use or threat of force) you will use to attain your
goals. _2 COPIES; 1 hard copy; 1 on Yahoogroup (for "Confidential" Papers, do
NOT put on Yahoogroup)_

####  _Case Evaluations_ (5 pts each) are written analyses of the cases. You
will be required to write on all 4 cases based on questions I provide.

####  _Book Review_ (5 pts) of _Wild Thorns._

####  _Case Study_ (25 pts) (13-15 pages). Write a case that focuses on a
significant aspect of the conflict. As much as possible, discuss historical,
political, economic, social, and geographic factors relating to this case.
Tell me your case topic by week 7.   Possibilities include: King Hussein's
Legacy on Middle East Peace, Negotiating the Wye Memorandum, Sharon's Visit to
Haram al-Sharif/Temple Mount, Clinton & Camp David II, Palestinian Suicide
Bombers: Why and Whom?, Israel's Policy of Assassination, "W" & the Middle
East, Where "Oslo" went wrong, ...

* * *

####  ODDS & ENDS - BUT NOT TRIVIAL...

####  Late Papers? "Life Happens" but we all must stick to our schedules and
deadlines, as agreed. If you submit any late papers, they will be marked down.
Please note: _Case Evaluations will not be accepted late_.   To accept them
late would give unfair advantage to those who would benefit from class
discussions and then write their papers.

####  Papers must be typed and include footnotes and, when appropriate, a
bibliography.

####  Attendance is mandatory.  Anyone who has 2 or more unexcused absences
will receive 0 (zero) points for participation and attendance.

####  _The simulation is an absolute requirement._

_Case Evaluations:_   Beginning in Week 3, we will engage in Case Discussions.
Check the syllabus to see which weeks will be "case weeks".  You will have a
writing assignment related to each case:

  * answer the study questions which I will provide for each case
  * each answer is to comprise one or two coherent, well-written pages that really do answer the questions; credit will be given for answers that demonstrate thoughtful, careful reading of the case, originality, good writing, and neatness -- essays must be TYPED/WORD PROCESSED and are DUE ON THE DAY WE DISCUSS THE CASE -- NO EXTENSIONS!
  * essays are individual projects -- do not cooperate with other students in writing case analyses exercises; however, you should explore ideas and discuss your thoughts within your study group

###  _LEARNING WITH CASES_

#####  _(Adapted from materials provided by the[Pew Faculty Fellowship in
International Affairs](HTTP://csf.colorado.edu/CaseNet/pew.html))_

####  _This course makes use of the case-study approach to learning. It is
hoped that students will: develop critical thinking skills, learn through
decision making and role playing situations through interactive discussions,
develop confidence in confronting problems, as well as defining, analyzing,
and solving them be encouraged to apply theoretical concepts to actual
historical and contemporary situations, students will develop skills in public
discussion and group problem solving_

####  _A case is a narrative of an actual, or realistic, problem that
typically portrays actors confronted with the need to make a decision. Cases
present information but not analysis; you supply the latter and advocate a
solution or course of action. We will use in-class discussion to develop a
solution to any problems posed in the case._

####  _Generally, a case has no single "correct" answer; there are only
choices \-- some better, some worse than others. Case discussions demand your
ideas and participation in order to analyze a problem and decide on courses of
action._

####  _How YOU can participate productively:_

####  _1\. Case Preparation:_

####  _a. in reading the case, start by skimming -- read the intro and
conclusion, and skim the whole case; look for headings and an outline; what is
this case about IN GENERAL?  
b. read the entire case rapidly without underlining or highlighting  
c. make a brief outline -- WHO is involved in the case? WHAT are the main
issues?  
d. What do the study questions (which I provide) ask? What issues in the
course does the case involve?  
e. Reread the case carefully; look for opportunities to answer study questions
\-- i.e., answers themselves or, more likely, information you may analyze to
answer the question yourself.  
f. Discuss the case with a study group; get feedback on your ideas; compare
different views/interpretations of the same issues; build your confidence in
preparation to discuss the case with the entire class; learn from one
another's thinking patterns and problem-solving styles.  
g. Work the problem. Answer the specific study questions by relying on
information gained from the reading and the study group discussion._

####  _2\. Case Discussion_

####  _a. Be prepared to present your ideas and to support them with evidence
and persuasion. Be equally prepared to listen to the comments of your
colleagues. Keep an open mind, and do not hesitate to incorporate ideas of
other students when you find them persuasive.  
b. Do not wait too long before getting involved in class discussion.  
c. If you want to raise an issue that is completely different from the one the
class is discussing, consider waiting until the class is ready to move to
another issue. If you feel that you need to interject your point \--
especially if you feel the class is moving in the wrong direction -- try to do
so by linking your comments to those of others.  
d. Respect each other's comments, even if you disagree. Try to build bridges
between ideas; look for connections, even if they are to disagree. Look for
ways to work collectively as a team even as we disagree.  
e. Don't hesitate to admit confusion, ask for clarification, or simply be
wrong. Perhaps none of us likes to do these things, but by doing so, we help
the group stay focused._

####  _How Participation is Evaluated: I evaluate student participation
according to the following criteria:_

####  _1\. Degree of preparation and level of knowledge about the case,
assigned reading, and lecture:_

####  _A. always well informed and prepared  
B. generally prepared and informed  
C. preparation and knowledge mixed  
D. seldom prepared and knowledge limited  
F. not prepared and often absent_

####  _2\. Productivity of comments, effort made in advancing discussion,
willingness to try new ideas, courtesy to others:_

####  _A. comments productive, to the point and useful in advancing the
discussion, and willing to venture into new territory  
B. comments generally constructive and useful  
C. comments at time lacking in purpose or in developing conversation  
D. comments rarely constructive, limited engagement with discussion even when
called upon  
F. comments typically unconstructive, off the point, rude or flippant_

####  _To corroborate my assessment, I will ask each student to provide me
with her/his own self-evaluation plus a peer-evaluation. The self-evaluation
involves (1) placing yourself on a scale of 1 to 5, poor to excellent, in
terms of your participation and contribution to class learning; and (2) giving
a written explanation for this placement. The peer-evaluation involves your
determination of which student(s) have been real group leaders who have
contributed to our learning and understanding._

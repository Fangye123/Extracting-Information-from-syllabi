**_ Syllabus _**  
  
**Class Texts:**  
 _The Norton Anthology of American Literature_ , Vol. I. Fifth Edition. Ed
Nina Baym. W.W. Norton & Company: New York, 1998.  
A Good Dictionary.

**Summary of Course Goals: **

  * To learn common vocabulary from the masters and mistresses of Literature.
  * To acquire some specific knowledge about the historical and social context of Early American life and culture.
  * To acquire some basic literary and philosophical vocabulary and learn how it applies to our texts.
  * To graduate from the class having gained a basic understanding of how the values of early American were alike and different from ours own.
  * To understand that the emergence of what we now believe is rooted in the literature of the past.
  * To act as a useful community member by contributing to the discussion of ideas in an effort to understand our common reading. 

**Course Requirements and Evaluation**  

Three short essays **50 pt. apiece for 150 pt.)--**

    * A comparison/contrast of film to text (See details at [www.ulm.edu/~eller/amlit/response1.htm](http://www.ulm.edu/~eller/amlit/response1.htm))
    * Annotation (See example at ???  TBA)
    * A brief research paper chosen from a list of topics provided by Eller

Description of Annotation:  While you are reading, take note of names of
persons, places, and things with which you are unfamiliar.  Do an annotation
(Essay 2) on one of those items.  For instance, while we are reading an
Iroquois creation story, you might choose to deliver a picture and short (200
word max.) explanation supporting the illustration of the person, place or
thing you found mentioned in the text.  You should explain how your discovery
and the illustration (if you use one) help understand the text we are reading.
An annotation can include information, folklore, popular, and/or historical
commentary about food, tools, clothing, buildings, persons, plants/flowers,
animals, minerals, weapons, hairstyles, rivers, towns, etc.--any number of
things which are only briefly mentioned in an original text.  You will not be
told what to write; instead, you must find your own subjects in the texts we
read.  NO BIOGRAPHIES OF AUTHORS ALLOWED.  NO INTERNET SOURCES FOR GRAPHIC OR
FOR INFORMATION.

**Memorization and Delivery (50 pt.)**

  * Sometime toward the end of the semester you will be asked to memorize and recite a short poem and brief oral analysis of the poem to the class.  The teacher will model.

**FourTests \--**  
All four tests will be a mixed objective, short answer and short essay:

  * Multiple choice and matching characters, events, and quotes to stories, and poems;
  * Multiple choice and matching ideas and themes to the authors and stories which promote them;
  * Matching definition to vocabulary and giving short answer definitions for vocabulary;
  * Occasional memorization of selected items--perhaps a short poem or a quote here and there;
  * Short answers to questions which come up in class, not asking for your own opinion so much as asking you to support or prove a statement using details from our common reading--usually a paragraph or two long. 

Two of the tests will be delivered on line as take-home tests, and two of them
will be taken either in Admin 2-95 or at a distance site by arrangement with
Eller.  The first three tests will be worth 100 points apiece and the final
will be worth 200 points

**15 quizzes (10 pt. apiece for 150 pt.)--  
** Quizzes are completely objective and ask for information from the readings
including introductory material, focus files and material from websites you've
been asked to view.  One or two bonus quizzes may be offered by the end of the
semester.

**15 email responses or chats (10 pt. apiece for 150 pt.)**  
Once a week there will be an on-line chat and an email response question
offered.   You can opt to do one or the other each week:

  * If you choose to respond to the email discussion question, you will be judged on the quality of the writing, whether or not you are attempting to respond directly to another student's comments, and the amount of detail from our readings included in your email as support for your answer.
  * If you choose to participate in the two hour on-line chat, you will be judged on your ability to respond to questions asked by Eller, your knowledge of the stories, and your ability to trade information and ideas with fellow students on-line.

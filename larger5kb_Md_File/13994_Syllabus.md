**Description:**

The course focuses on well-known figures, key ideas, social trends and
intellectual debates from Germany's rich cultural tradition from the sixteenth
to the nineteenth century. It will introduce you to representative works of
German music, fine arts, literature, and philosophy. We will discuss works by
Martin Luther, Immanuel Kant, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Johann Wolfgang Goethe,
The Brothers Grimm, and Karl Marx. You will learn about Germany's
contributions to major cultural currents such as the Baroque, the
Enlightenment, Classicism, Romanticism, and Realism.  
    


**Required Readings:**

Hagen Schulze, Germany: A New History (Cambridge, MA: Harvard UP, 1998).  
Keith Thomas et al. German Philosophers (New York: Oxford UP, 1997).  
Course Packet available at UO Bookstore.

**Useful Reference Works:**

Gordon A. Craig, The Germans (New York: Meridian, 1991).  
Henry and Mary Garland, The Oxford Companion to German Literature (Oxford:
Oxford UP, 1986).  
Harold James, A German Identity 1770-1990 (New York: Routledge, 1989).  


**Testing and Makeup Policy:**

There will be _no make-ups_ except in case of an illness or other
extraordinary circumstances. The person in question must also have been
working in good faith. In case of such an emergency I must be notified before
the exam that you will not be able to attend. If I cannot be reached you can
leave a message on my voice mail.  


**Participation & Attendance:**

Attendance is essential and mandatory. More than two absences during the term
will affect your participation grade. For each additional absence two tenths
of a grade will be subtracted from your final grade. If you have a special
reason for being absent, please discuss it with me.  


**Quizzes and Assignments:**

You will be tested on your homework assignments, which will be based on the
readings, films and presentations discussed in class. These quizzes will be
given to ensure that you come to class prepared and have understood the
material covered in class. You must complete the reading and homework
assignments according to the attached syllabus. Additional assignments may be
given in class.  


**Group Assignments:**

Each group will present specific topics related on the syllabus. Everyone in
course must consult with the instructor on the topic and manner of
presentation. Every group member must present an outline of her/his
presentation on overhead transparency. A copy of the outline must be handed in
after your presentation. Each presentation should take about 10 minutes. You
are welcome to use notes for your presentation but you are not supposed to
simply read what you have written down. Impromptu presentations are much
livelier.  


**Discussion Board Assignments:**

Everyone in class will be asked to contribute once a week to a Discussion
Board for the course.  
For each week you will find a series of study questions at the following web
address: <http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~mathaesa/readings257.htm>  
You will choose one of the questions and comment on it. In order to post your
comments, you will log into the following web address:
<http://blackboard.uoregon.edu> . After you have logged in,  click the
_Discussion Board_ button on the left and then click on the Discussion Threat
button at the top of you page. Your comments should be concise (approx. 50-100
words). The comments will focus on central issues of the readings that we will
discuss in class. The comments must be posted by 6 p.m. on the day _before_
our class discussion. The purpose of these assignments is to get everyone
involved in class discussions.

**Grading:**

Midterm Exam 20%; Final Exam 20%; Quizzes 20%; Group Assignments 20%;  
In-class Participation 10%;  Discussion Board Assignments 10%  


**Expectations:**

Attendance is assumed. Participation is expected and will be graded. There
will be no make-ups except in case of an emergency or a confirmed illness. You
are expected to read approximately 100 pages per week as regular class
preparation. You will conduct research on two topics related to the course and
present your findings to the class.

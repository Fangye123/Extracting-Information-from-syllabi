## HNPG 036E  
Asian Religions in America

#### **Important Note: This syllabus is from a past course, it is intended for
informational purposes ONLY.   Actual class requirements, texts, and grading
may vary.**

#### Instructor: Professor Vivian Nyitray

This course is an exploration of the changing religious landscape of the
United States, looking at the  
history and dynamic interaction of Asian religious traditions--especially
Buddhist, Hindu, Jain, Sikh, and South Asian Muslim traditions--with other
religious traditions in the US. The seminar has a dual focus on how Asian
religious traditions change in the American environment and how America is
changing in this new multi-religious context.

**Required texts and materials  
** Diana L. Eck and the Pluralism Project, "On Common Ground: World Religions
in America" CD-ROM. New York: Columbia University Press. This will be a
primary resource for this course, and several copies will be available on
reserve in the Media Library.  
Thomas A. Tweed and Stephen Prothero. Asian Religions in America: A
Documentary History .  
Other readings (in addition to what is listed on the preliminary syllabus
below) TEA. Typically, students will be asked to read 100-150 pp. per week.

**Course requirements:**

  * Attendance and participation in class discussions. (10%)  
  * Eight weekly response papers (2-3 pp.) on readings or field visits. (40%)
  * A fmal term paper of approximately 15-20 pages ( 50% ). 

The paper could involve library research, internet research, fieldwork, or a
combination of the three. No matter what specific topic is chosen, the paper
should investigate one or more religious traditions in the American context.
It could be an historical paper, for example, on the 1893 World's Parliament
of Religions, on various "church-state" issues, or on the history and
development of one of the religious traditions in the U .S. It could be a more
theoretical paper, addressing some of the literature on pluralism,
multiculturalism, and the issues of "identity" in the U.S. from the
perspective of religious analysis. It could be a fieldwork paper on a temple,
mosque, interfaith council, or organization. In other words, students are
given a great deal of latitude, but also a great deal of responsibility in
posing the research questions. If students will be interviewing or "shadowing"
individuals, we will need to schedule a session to discuss human subjects'
considerations and protocols. There is an extensive bibliography in "On Common
Ground" and at the website linked to the Pluralism Project.

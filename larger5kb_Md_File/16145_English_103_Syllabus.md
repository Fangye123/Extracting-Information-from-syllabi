English/History 103 is a demanding course. Be sure to arrange you schedule so
you can spend adequate time for class preparation, researching, and writing.  
---  
  
**Writing Requirements**

  1. The **research paper** develops research, analytical, and writing skills.
  2. The **essay test** develops analytical and writing skills.

**Attendance Requirements**

  * Class attendance is regarded as an obligation as well as a privilege, and all students are expected to attend regularly and punctually all classes in which they are enrolled. Attendance is **10%** of your grade.
  * I shall keep a permanent attendance record for this class. This record is subject to inspection by appropriate college or university officials.
  * Regular attendance will help you understand your assignments and complete them on schedule. I encourage you to attend unless you absolutely cannot avoid being absent.

**Bring a 9" x 12" manilla folder to class for me to file your work in.**

**Conferences**

Conferences are encouraged during the quarter. They will be used to discuss
specific writing strengths and/or weaknesses.

**Guidelines for a paper's form**

  1. OUT-OF-CLASS papers **MUST** be typed. Handwritten papers will be returned ungraded. I encourage you to learn to use a computerized word-processing program. It can save time, aid proofreading, and improve the appearance of an essay.   Tech has several computer labs with word processing programs.
  2. In-class papers **MUST** be written in ink.
  3. Use one side of the paper only.
  4. Use standard 8 1/2" by 11" white paper. Loose leaf or typewriter paper please--no frazzled edges ripped from notebooks.
  5. Use margins of at least an inch on each side of the paper. Leave a 1.5" margin on the right-hand side.
  6. Papers (except for the long report) should be folded vertically with the following information on the outside cover: name, section, theme assignment, instructor's name, and date.
  7. **KEEP A PAPER COPY OF THE FINAL DRAFT IN YOUR OWN FILES**. It's the cheapest insurance you can buy.

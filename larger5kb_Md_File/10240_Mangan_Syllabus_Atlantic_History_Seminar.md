> **Course Description:**  
>  While distinct patterns of gender relations are generally used to
characterize Latin American society, this course reveals an ongoing resistance
to a single set of gender roles in the region. _Gender and History in Latin
America_ compares women's and men's experiences to determine how gender roles
have shaped the social and political history of Latin America. From the time
when native and European peoples met in the era of conquest, cultural ideas
about appropriate behavior for men and women played a critical role in the
negotiation of social and political life. Despite the attempts of the colonial
ruling elite to prescribe gender roles, most people resisted elite notions of
gender propriety and instead created their own codes of conduct. These gender
contests continued through the transition to Independence when the new Latin
American nations attempted to influence men's and women's public and private
activities. In the twentieth century, the boundaries of acceptable gender
behavior have been challenged yet again, by new contexts like political
activism and migration. As the class follows Latin American men and women on
this lengthy and complex path, it highlights how diversity among women and men
affected their experiences with gender roles, sexism, and patriarchy.

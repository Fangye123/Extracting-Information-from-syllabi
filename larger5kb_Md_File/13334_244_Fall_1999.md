Course Description and Objectives  
The objective of this course is to understand the witch hunts not as an
aberration or "craze," but rather as a phenomenon that was organically related
to early modern society, law, government, culture, and theology. The course
examines the origins, evolution, and decline of the witch hunts, drawing
comparisons between Continental Europe, England, and New England. In addition
to increasing your understanding of the witch hunts and early modern society,
the course is designed to deepen your appreciation of the study of history,
strengthen your capacity to think critically and analytically, and improve
your research and writing skills. You will be expected to analyze primary
documents carefully and thoughtfully, develop and defend your own
interpretations, and write a substantive research paper.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  
  

Exams will consist of short-answer questions and large essay questions. Each
of the three exams will cover roughly one-third of the course; the third exam
will also include a comprehensive section.

2\. A Research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 25%
for the second)  
  

The research paper can be on any topic related to the witch hunts. The paper
is to be analytical and interpretive; it should present a thesis and develop
an argument. It is incumbent upon you to define and develop a thesis. The
first draft should be approximately four to six pages in length, and the
second draft six to eight.

You are encouraged to use primary sources, and you are expected to examine the
historiographical context of your topic. Secondary sources should consist
mostly of scholarly articles and books, not simply reference material and
textbooks. First drafts may be limited to sources available in the Duggan
Library, but you are expected to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional
sources for the final draft. You should include with your first draft a
bibliography based on a universal search for sources.

The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of the thesis and
argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the quality of the
writing. The grade of the first draft will also reflect the quality of your
bibliography (based on a universal search), and the second draft will reflect
the quality of the sources used. You should consult with me about your paper
at least a week before each draft is due.

3\. Class participation and daily writing assignments (10%)  
  

As a small seminar, the success of this class depends upon the quality of the
dialogue in class. It is expected that you will attend every class and that
you will be fully prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day.
Class participation grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency
of your contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

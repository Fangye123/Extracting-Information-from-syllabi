**Description of course:**

After a brief look into the Greek bronze age (3000 to 1100 BCE) to search out
what we know about the origins of the people English speaking people call
"Greeks," we begin our search for the Hellenic mind during the Greek dark ages
which terminated with the poetry of Homer. From Homer we move on to the age of
exploration and "colonization" in which Greek ideas were exported to the Black
Sea, Southern Italy, and elsewhere, including Egypt, and during which outside
ideas penetrated the Greek world and mind. It was during this period, called
Archaic, that one finds the rise of lyric poetry, and the beginnings of
history, philosophy, theatre, monumental sculpture and architecture, and
toward the end of the period (the result of a lengthy evolution) the
appearance of democracy in Athens. The century also saw the expansion of
Persia to the Ionian coast of Anatolia and then in the next century two
aggressive Persian incursions into the islands of the Aegean Sea and the
Balkan peninsula took place. In both instances the Persians were pushed back
at Marathon (490) and Salamis (480) by an unusual coalition of the Greek city
states of European Greece, led by the rising political and military powers of
Athens and Sparta. The Persian defeat led to the environment in which Athens
was able to establish hegemony over much of the Ionian Greek world and
consequently bring to the Greeks its questionably imperialistic dominance but
undoubted magnificent efflorescence in the arts and literature. But this
'Golden Age' was a period of time (480 to 400) in which fear of Athens' power
and Athenian pride were to lead to a war between Ionian Athens and Dorian
Sparta which led to the defeat of Athens and the weakening of Sparta to the
point that a place was made for the rise of Macedonia under Philip II and the
end of the old independent Greek city state. Philip's achievements and the
abortive resistance to his overwhelming advance end the focus of our course.
But we will close with a brief look at the rise of Hellenistic Greece, its
influence on Rome, the reemergence of Hellenic dominance with the rise of
Christianity and the consequent Byzantine Empire, the revival of Greek
learning in the western Pagan Revival, the reinstitution of a modern Greece
closely tied to the old, and Greek influences on our culture today.

**Purpose and objectives** :

  * to become familiar with the geographical and topographical features of the Greek world. 
  * to gain a general knowledge of the chronological flow of Greek history from the Bronze Age to the rise of Macedonia under Alexander the Great. 
  * to learn about some of the methods used in the writing of "history" and how the works of historians differ. 
  * to investigate through reading, analysis, and discussion of primary sources what the ancient Greeks themselves had to say about politics and society, philosophy, religion, war, women, theater, and science. 
  * to become an expert on a topic relating to Greek history. 
  * to learn as much as is possible in one semester, given the amount of time we have to spend, about the history of Greece. 
  * to examine the afterglow of Hellenic civilization through its influence on Rome, the West, the modern country of Greece, and us.

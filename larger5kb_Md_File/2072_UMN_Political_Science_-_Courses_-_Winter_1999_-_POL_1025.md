**Course Description**

This course will survey the history of world politics to investigate what
patterns of contemporary global politics represent fundamental
transformations, and what - if anything - resembles the past. To analyze the
sources of continuity and change, students will be introduced to a variety of
explanations and theories of world politics. These will be applied to a number
of topics, such as the causes of wars, the effect of nuclear weapons on world
politics, the end of the Cold War, and the role of morality in world politics.
The aim is for students to be able to think in an informed and critical way
about big issues such as the causes of war and peace, and of prosperity and
poverty in world politics.

Class will consist of multimedia lecture presentations, interactive class
exercises, and an interactive course web site that will connect you to the
world and assist you in completing your assignments. You must check the web
page regularly for announcements and course information. A list serve has been
set-up on the web site that connects you to a discussion group at the
University of Toronto, enabling you to discuss issues in world politics with
your own classmates and with international students.

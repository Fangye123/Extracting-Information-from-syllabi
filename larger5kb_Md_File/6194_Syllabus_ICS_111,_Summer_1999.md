COURSE NAME, NUMBER, AND PREREQUISITES

**Introduction to Computer Science I, ICS111**

**Prerequisites:**

The official prerequisite for this course is ICS101, but if you are familiar
with computers, that will suffice. You should be able to use computers and
application software, and it would be better if you are familiar with UNIX and
Pine.

ICS 111 COURSE DESCRIPTION

> __

**What will we be covering in this course?**  
This is a fast-paced overview of computer science. We will learn how to write
**JAVA** programs and applets. The approach of this course is completely
Object-Oriented. This course will require you to make wide use of logic and
some basic math. You are required to be computer literate since the teaching
of this course is based on that. **I won't teach basic computer skills**

**So how are we going to do this?**  
We will have a 90-minute lecture (with a 5-minute break) in which we will be
reviewing the theory behind JAVA and OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), and we
will write and test some programs. After that, during the laboratory,
assignments based in class material will be given.

**What will be expected of you, the student?**  
You will need to dedicate at least two hours a day to study JAVA, and to write
your programming assignments. This course is very time-consuming, mostly if it
is your first programming class. I strongly advise you that if you are taking
this course during the summer, take this course **only**.

ICS 111 REQUIRED COURSE MATERIALS

  * **-BOOK-  
Introduction to Programming using Java** _An Object-Oriented Approach_  
Authors: David Arnow and Gerald Weiss  
ISBN 0-201-47182-5  

  * **UHUNIX account.**   
If you don't have one, you may get one [
here](http://www.hawaii.edu/help/idreqinfo.html). If you have any problems
with that, please contact the instructor one week before the class starts.
**Notice:** The first day of instruction I will be explaining what you need to
know about UNIX for this course. This information will be necessary for the
students to compile and turn in their Java programs.

  * **Lab Account**  
This account will allow you to use the computers in the classrooms/labs. The
classrooms and labs are located in the POST building 3rd. floor. POST 318A,
POST 318B and POST319. To get this account, you will be filling up an
application the first day of instruction.

ICS 111 ASSIGNMENT POLICIES

**How to submit your assignments:**  
You are required to send you assignments by e-mail. The date and the time will
be specified for each assignment. **All the assignments will be compiled and
graded using UNIX** Late assignments will have a deduction of .83 points every
2 hours during the 24 hours period following the deadline and 10 points per
day after the first day.

I will consider the timestamp given by UHUNIX in your e-mails to apply this
policy. To avoid unnecessary deductions, make sure that you e-mail your
assignments a few minutes before the deadline. Also, take into consideration
that the system may be down for hours and that this may affect your grade.

**Assignment due dates:**  
Specific deadlines will be given for each one of the assignments. You will be
required to turn in an assignment aproximately, every five days.

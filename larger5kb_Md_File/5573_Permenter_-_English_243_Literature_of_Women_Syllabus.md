FINAL EXAM**: **MAY 11** Discussion wrap-up; presentations.

**

DUE: CRITICAL PAPER #2** and Final Response.

**



COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

1\. Weekly class attendance.

2\. Five (5) Reader Responses (50 pts. possible)** _before_ midterm exam.
Choose five classes _before Mar. 23rd_ for which to write your reactions to
the material. **E-mail these Responses to your discussion group members and
professor by Tuesday at noon.** These are comments written after you have read
the assignment due for that Tuesday evening's class. These should be loose --
free-writing, free association, gut reaction, or unabashed opinion about the
material as well as some critical analysis -- and can have moments of wild
rants. Don't worry about consistency or organization. See Criteria Sheet.

![](Image14.gif) **

3.** **Two 3-5 pp.[ Critical
Papers](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/engl/rperment/5steps.htm) (225 pts.
possible)** as take-home examinations (Critical Paper #1 is half of your
midterm; Critical Paper #2 is your final exam). From your Reader Responses,
but using strong textual evidence and organized analysis, you will present a
critical opinion of a work or a group of short works on the syllabus. You
should worry a lot about consistency and organization.   See [criteria
sheet](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/engl/rperment/criteria.htm).

**

4.** **Research (50 pts. possible).** A 7-minute individual presentation,
20-minute group presentation, **or** 3 pp. paper. All require a bibliography
using MLA format (at least four sources). A short handout for MLA style is
available from instructor. See AResearch Topics " and Criteria Sheet.

**

5.** **In-class Midterm Examination (100 pts. possible)**. Mostly
identification and explication of quotations from the literature.

**

6\. Additional Response (25 pts. possible)**. A short Reader Response of the
book you did not choose for Critical Paper #2 C _Sula_ or _Woman Hollering
Creek_. (Turn in with critical paper for final exam, not by e-mail.)



**

BASIS FOR GRADES** :

Final grades for this course will be assessed by your percentage of points.

Reader Responses: 50 pts.*

Research Pres/Paper: 50 possible pts.

Midterm Examination: 100 possible pts.

Critical Paper # 1: 100 possible pts.**

Critical Paper #2: 125 possible pts.

Final Exam Response: 25 possible pts.

*Each response earns either full points or none. It either meets the minimum requirements, as described in Course Guidelines below, or does not. (The _first_ response will be returned to you if it does not earn credit. You may rewrite for credit within one week of its return to you.) Your Response points for the course will be accumulated as follows: 

> > > 5 Responses = 50 pts.

>>>

>>> 4 Responses = 40 pts.

>>>

>>> 3 Responses = 30 pts.

>>>

>>> 2 Responses = 20 pts.

>>>

>>> 1 Response = 10 pts.

**Critical Paper #1 may be revised and resubmitted for extra points within one
week of its initial return to you.

![](Image15.gif)





**





COURSE GUIDELINES:

[Papers](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/engl/rperment/5steps.htm):** Papers
and the research bibliography must be wp/computer printed and in MLA format.
Do not rely on outside research for your critical papers. They should be just
you and the work, with help from class discussions and the introductory
sections of _Norton_. Use quotations from the work as evidence to back up your
views. You may use outside research minimally if it is well-documented. Grades
will be based on (1) extent of critical and original thinking, (2) close
reference to the text(s), (3) clarity of expression (organization around a
thesis and correctness of grammar, usage, spelling, etc.), and (4) use of
proper format. See Criteria Sheet and attach to your paper.

**

Responses:** Reader Responses should be spell-checked and submitted by e-mail
to discussion group members and professor. (Compose using your wordprocessing
program, save as a file to your disk, block & paste to your e-mail message
space, & send.) Printed responses will be accepted the night of class **if
e-mail accessibility is a problem for you** (discuss with professor). It is
recommended that you come to every class with reading notes (a mix of
notetaking with your reactions, opinions, and questions). Add class notes to
this  "reader's journal." On five occasions you are asked to refine them a bit
and turn them in as Reader Responses. This procedure will help you study for
your midterm and write your critical papers. Keep copies for yourself since
they will not be returned to you (see Basis for Grades above). You will earn
full credit if (1) you reach the required length of approximately 350 words,
(2) you show evidence that you are involved with the material, (3) you attempt
to make some critical analysis of the literature (this differentiates a reader
response from a personal diary entry), and (4) you include comments on
_**all**_ the reading assigned for that class.

**

Late Work:** For **each day** a written assignment is late, 10% of pts. will
be deducted (approximately one letter grade). For each class session a
presentation is late, 10 pts. will be deducted.

**

Plagiarism** will not be tolerated: If you submit any work which is not the
product of your own study and efforts, you will receive a grade of F for that
work and probably for the course. Extreme violations will be reported to the
appropriate university agencies.

**

Absence:** Absence and tardiness are strongly discouraged. For each unexcused
absence above ONE, 30 points will be deducted from your final grade. A night
class is the same as one week of classes. Absences beyond one will be excused
only if documentation from a dean or doctor is provided or in the case of
dangerous road conditions due to weather.

**

Class & On-line Participation:** Learning in this course relies heavily on
spirited conversation and debate. Superior contributions to discussions and
activities in class and/or on-line may add 10-15 pts. to your total point
accumulation. You are encouraged to add comments or questions (particularly
excerpts from your Reader Responses) to our web-based discussion threads
(access from course syllabus).

**

Conferences:** You are invited to initiate discussion with the professor
during office hours, after class, and by appointment. This is a good way to
get feedback on your Reader Responses. _At least one conference_ regarding
your first critical paper and your presentation is highly recommended.

**

Computer Use:** Although this course is designed to assist learning with
computer technology, your level of proficiency with computers upon entering
the course _will not_ hinder your success. Since one of the university's goals
for its graduates is computer literacy, you should use this opportunity to
become more proficient. There are several computer labs on campus for your
use. If you have little or no experience with wordprocessing, e-mail, the
internet, the campus network, or interactive webpages, ask classmates and take
advantage of the professor's offer to help you during office hours and after
class.

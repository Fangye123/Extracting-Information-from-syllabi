###  _Attendance Policy_ :

Attendance in this class is _STRONGLY RECOMMENDED_. Because we will follow a
lecture/discussion format, class participation is expected. If a student
arrives after the roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to make
sure his or her presence has been recorded at the end of the period. If a
student has eleven absences, excused or unexcused, he or she will
automatically fail the course. If a student has more than four unexcused
absences, ten points will be deducted from his or her final average.  
_Make-up Policy_ :  
Make-up exams will be administered only when students can show a valid reason
for their absence (this means confirmation from either the health center or
from the dean). Students must schedule the make-up exam with the instructor
within one week of the original exam. Failure to make such arrangements will
result in failure of the course.

###  Honor Code:

The Honor Code is based on the need for trust in an academic community.
Longwood's Honor Code is a system developed by and maintained for the welfare
of its students, and all students should make sure that they read and
understand it provisions as outlined in the Student Handbook. All work
completed for this course will be considered pledged.

###  **_Book Reviews_**

For the Trollope and Kornfeld books, you will be required to write one- to
two-page reviews, with special emphasis on thesis, writing, and evidence.
These reviews will be similar to the professional reviews you read for the
book dissection exercise (described below). They will also help you in the
discussion of these books. Keep in mind that the Trollope book is a primary
source and must be judged differently than a secondary source. These reviews
will be due on the day these books are discussed. Five points per day will be
deducted for every day the review is late (if the review is not handed in
during class, it will be considered a day late). The Trollope review will not
be accepted more than twenty days after its due date. The Kornfeld review will
not be accepted after the final exam (both are required to pass the course).

###  **_BOOK DISSECTION EXERCISE:_**

**(Based on a similar project designed by Prof. Greg Monahan, Eastern Oregon
University)**

_INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVES_

Chemists and Biologists perform much of their research in laboratories. The
library is the historian's laboratory, and books are often the tools of our
research. Part of succeeding in an upper-division history course is learning
how historians work. The single most basic skill for any historian is to know
how to read a historical __monograph__ critically and thoroughly. That means
knowing the parts of a book, grasping the arguments of its author, and
understanding other historians' criticisms and analyses of that book. It also
means that historians must be able to explain to others efficiently where they
found the information or interpretations they use in their own work. Since
historians are entrusted with the past, they carry a lot of responsibility for
getting it right. They must check their sources for bias, confirm their
information from as many sources as possible, try as hard as they can to be
objective in their own work, and make sure someone else has checked their work
before they publish it. This exercise is designed to help students develop
some of those skills. Everyone is an historian to some extent. It's important
to be a good one. **This assignment will be due on Monday, September 28, 1998,
at the beginning of class. Only completed assignments will be accepted. Five
points will be deducted for every day the assignment is late. Assignments
turned in after class on the 28 th will be considered a day late. NO PAPERS
WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER MONDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1998 (resulting in a failure of the
course).**

_The Book_  
You will all be reading Stephen Ambrose's _Undaunted Courage_. You will also
need to go to the library and locate one scholarly review of that book before
you begin reading it. Your review must be complete, and it must be at least
three paragraphs in length. You will make a photocopy of the review for your
use. Good sources for reviews of books are _The American Historical Review_ ,
_The Journal of Southern History_ , _The Historian_ , _The New York Times Book
Review_ , and _The New York Review of Books._ Most of the journals in which
you can find reviews of your book are indexed in the _Book Review Index_ and
the _Index to Book Reviews in the Humanities_. Abstracts of reviews can be
found in _Book Review Digest_ , but these alone will not satisfy the
requirement. In addition, you may not take a review from _Choice_. If you find
an abstract that looks interesting, order the entire review on interlibrary
loan! In addition, most journals such as the _American Historical Review_ are
indexed each year in the last issue that appears that year. You will need to
look in the 1996 and 1997 journals to find these reviews. **THIS IS NOT A
GROUP ASSIGNMENT. WORK ON YOUR OWN TO LOCATE A REVIEW OF THIS BOOK.**

_THE EXERCISE_  
The exercise is divided into three parts: 1) Citation and Acknowledgment, 2)
Arguments, and 3) Critique. Each of the three sections is defined and
described below. You will receive a separate letter grade for each section.
Since, however, the second section will be longer and more involved than the
other two, it will be worth as much as the other two put together. There will
also be a separate writing grade that will evaluate grammar and spelling. All
these grades will be combined to create a grade for the assignment as a whole.

_PART ONE: CITATION AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS_  
This portion of the assignment allows you to describe certain physical parts
of the book and cite it properly. Answer the following questions and perform
the following:

1\. Type out a bibliographical citation ( _not a footnote or endnote citation_
) for your book using the form outlined in Kate Turabian, _A Manual for
Writers_ , available in the library. The form must be precisely correct (note
the proper bibliographic citation form at the top of this syllabus).

2\. What is the International Standard Book Number of your book? If it does
not have one, what is its L.C. number?

3\. Does it have an index? Is the index slightly or extensively cross-
referenced or is it not cross-referenced at all? (If you do not know what
cross-referencing is, do some research and find out!)

4\. How is the bibliography of the book organized? Is it annotated?

5\. Approximately what percentage of the sources Ambrose cites in his notes
are primary? What percentage are secondary? Did Ambrose consult archives or
depend entirely on printed works he could find in a library?

6\. Who read all or part of the book prior to its publication to check it for
mistakes? What organization if any supported Ambrose with money to do the
research and/or writing of the book?

_PART TWO: ARGUMENTS_  
This part is the most involved. It requires a thorough reading of the book. It
demands that you comprehend Ambrose's "arguments." Historians use that word to
mean the author's interpretation, the case that he/she is making about the
subject. When historians confront evidence, whether it's a large number of
printed sources or archival records, they must try to make sense of those
sources. The "sense" they make is their interpretation. The purpose of their
monographs is to present their evidence and "argue" their interpretation of
that evidence. Your purpose in this section is to summarize Ambrose's
arguments and indicate some of the evidence used to support those
interpretations. Write three sentences--and only three--on each chapter of the
book. Begin all of your sentences as follows:

1\. For the first sentence on each chapter, begin with the words, "The main
subject of this chapter is" but do not include any words from the chapter
title in your description.

2\. For the second sentence on each chapter, begin with the words, "Ambrose's
purpose in this chapter is to argue that."

3\. For the third sentence on each chapter, begin with the words, "One key
piece of evidence that Ambrose uses to support his case is." _Only list one
piece of relevant evidence_.

After you have written a trio of sentences for each chapter, write one single
five-sentence paragraph at the end of this entire section of your paper
summarizing Ambrose's argument as a whole about the subject of the book.

_PART THREE: ANALYSIS AND CRITIQUE_  
In this section, you have two things to do. First, analyze the argument from
the standpoint of the course. What did this book teach you that you did not
already know about the Early National Period? Was the argument convincing?
Well-supported? The professor does not care whether you found it well-written
or interesting. Secondly, analyze the review of the book. Did the reviewer
mostly summarize the book or did he/she evaluate it critically? Did he/she
agree with the author's interpretation? Why or why not? Did he/she have
criticisms? What were they? Do you find the reviewer's criticisms, if any,
germane to the Ambrose's arguments or peripheral? Do you agree with the
reviewer's assessment? Why or why not?

Be sure to include with your final draft of the exercise, the attached check
sheet and the photocopied review so the professor can double-check your work
and make sure you did not render a first draft. Good luck!

  ** _Check Sheet: Book Dissection Exercise_**



____1. I have attached one book review and this check sheet.



____2. The right margin of my paper is not straight like the left.



____3. I have proofread and proofread and proofread the final draft to remove
every single spelling error I humanly can.



____4. I have purged my writing of sentence fragments and comma splices.



____5. I have typed this exercise on a computer and have used a computer
spell-checker.



____6. I have not committed any of the four mortal sins (I like(d), I do (did)
not like, "the people," and "etc.")



I pledge, upon my word of honor and in full cognizance of the possible
penalties, including an "F" in the course and suspension from the college,
that this review is my own work written by me and by no one else, and that I
have not resorted to plagiarism, _that I have read the whole book thoroughly
and have written the best paper I can._

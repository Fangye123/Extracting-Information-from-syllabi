### COURSE DESCRIPTION

The field study of biotic communities. Involves outdoor camping and study of
various sections of the United States. This course may be repeated. Either
lecture, lab or field work may be performed on any given day, depending on the
weather and other factors.  
There are many issues involved in offering this course:

  1. I'm thinking of the American Southwest--New Mexico. This is comfortable territory for me, and, besides, Florida will be overrun with students intent on other pursuits. Carlsbad Caverns and other natural areas we'll be sure to hit. 
  2. This would take all of spring break PLUS the weekends on each end for travel. 
  3. We will camp out in tents with sleeping bags, cook stoves, etc. 
  4. Besides the normal tuition for 3 credit hours, there will be an additional cost for vehicle rental, food, gas and camping fees. 
  5. A deposit will be required up front. We need this to confirm people's intent to take the class. We can't plan the class, buy food, etc., then have all but 2 drop out the day before we leave. 
  6. We must have a minimum number of 6 people to make the course run. If you are interested, try to convince others to come as well. 
  7. I haven't set a maximum number yet, though I don't think that will be a problem. In future, the maximum will be 8. 
  8. I am thinking we will spend a lot of time in the field hiking, etc. and learning to identify species (mostly animals, but plants where I am able). We will then try to execute one simple field experiment from which we can collect data for ONE lab report, to be due by the end of the semester. There will be quizzes, written and in the field, on identification. 
  9. This course satisfies the field course requirement in biology. 
  10. I'll let those interested know additional details as they become available. 
  11. The primary goal will be to have fun! (while learning) 
  12. Planning meetings will be held in the weeks leading up to departure.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES

  1. To become familiar with the flora and fauna of non-local habitats via identification during hikes and other travels. 
  2. To develop an understanding of the ecological dynamics of a non-local ecosystem. 
  3. To generate and perform an ecological experiment in the field, including planning, execution, data collection and analysis, and formal writing. 
  4. To learn cooperation with others in a field situation. 

### Prerequisite

Bio 315 or 402 or consent of instructor.

### REQUIREMENTS

  * Attendance and participation in lectures, field trips and exams. 
  * Completion and return of the [Health Form](HealthForm.doc). 
  * Deposit of required funds in the Business Office. 
  * Good physical fitness--lots of hiking is involved

**Course description**  
This course explores issues about the nature and techniques of critical
thought, viewed as a way of thinking aimed at minimizing error and
irrationality in our beliefs and attitudes. We explore multiple perspectives,
placing established facts, theories, and practices in tension with
alternatives to see how things could be otherwise. Views about observation and
interpretation, reasoning and inference, valuing and judging, and the
production of knowledge in its social context are considered. Special
attention is given to translating what is learned into strategies, materials,
and interventions for use in students' own educational and professional
settings.

**Course goals**  
The goals of the course are for participants to:  
1\. appreciate and reflect on the range of views on critical thinking,
contrasts and tensions among those views, and the evolution of the field
toward increasing attention to the social context in which thinking takes
place;  
2\. work new views, skills, and model lessons/group activities into practices
of thinking, learning, teaching critical thinking to others, and finding
support for change (see 3);  
3\. develop support to understand 1 and sustain 2 beyond this course,
especially the support that derives from having active conversants,
appreciative listeners, and dialoguing around written work.

**Assessment and Requirements**  
Your grade will be based on the components to follow, which are described in
more detail in the course packet and weekly handouts. For each of the two
parts of the grade, completion of "basic work" (= 80% of assignments) gives
you an automatic B+. To have a chance--but not a guarantee--of getting a
higher grade, "additional work" is taken into account (s rationale).  
  
Written assignments and presentations, 2/3 of the grade  
A. Design, conduct, document a learning experience that applies critical
thinking. Involves a sequence of 4 assignments: initial description with
sources, class test run of the experience, complete draft report, and
1000-2000 word final report.  
B. Five thought-pieces extracted from your journal (see F. below)  
C. Clippings packet of items from current magazines and newspapers. Collected
for perusal twice with journal.  
D. Manifesto, with tips and examples, for critical thinkers (a.k.a. check-list
for future critical thinking efforts; 400-1000 words).  
  
Participation and contribution to the class process, 1/3 of the grade.  
E. Prepared participation and attendance at class meetings.  
F. Journal with weekly responses/notes on homework tasks, readings, class
discussions, clippings, websites, and weekly questions. Collected for perusal
mid-semester  & end.  
G. Minimum of two in-office or phone conferences on your assignments and
projects.  
H. Assist another student(s) to practice and conduct their learning
experiences.  
I. Optional* End-of-semester Portfolio demonstrating the development of your
work (*for "additional work" grade only).

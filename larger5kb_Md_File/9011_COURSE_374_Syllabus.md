### READINGS ON CHINA: INTELLECTUAL HISTORY

**History 374  
Dennis Grafflin**

  

            ** _Idea:_**   The literate elites that ruled China until the early years of the twentieth century grounded their intellectual tradition in a relatively small number of ancient texts. These are works that still influence thought and discussion throughout East Asia and beyond. Most of these texts possess enduring literary and philosophical values that provide points of entry for the modern Western student willing to read them with patient attention.   
It has recently been argued that there is more cultural diversity within these
texts than traditional scholars appreciated, and even a significant South
Asian influence on Chinese thought prior to the spread of Buddhism into
Central and Southeast Asia, and thence to China. Therefore, the reading list
has been revised to emphasize different voices within the Chinese tradition,
and to incorporate one of the Indian works claimed to have influenced early
Chinese thought, as well as the work of Buddhist scripture that has had the
greatest impact in East Asia.  
          There is also a growing interest in Western critical theory about how cultures construct their stories of themselves, which has led to the addition of an early historical masterpiece to the reading list. 

           ** _Method:_**   There is almost no lecturing in this course.  It is assumed that these writings, carefully considered, are their own best explanations.  For that reason, the course proceeds as a series of discussions of textual material, supported by the writing of a series of short papers.

**GRADING SYSTEM \- Intentions**

          Traditional grading habits and contemporary learning research are sadly at odds with each other.  People tend to see grading as a competitive exercise.  In this view, one gets a good grade by putting distance between one's own performance and everyone else's.  On the other hand, research on learning has concluded that people learn more when they work in small cooperative groups.  Studies of gender effects in education suggest that these differences are particularly significant for women students.  (The usual explanation offered is that women in this culture learn a more empathetic and collaborative style of interaction, while men are more likely to be rewarded for aggressive and selfish behavior.)  Since not everything can be done by small work teams in a college setting, it seems reasonable to attempt a hybrid system which recognizes individual excellence, but does so in a setting which is mutually supportive rather than destructive. 

          Another split between traditional procedure and contemporary insight concerns the balance between passive-listening situations like a lecture, and active involvement, as in seminars or discussions.  Lecturing allows an instructor to "cover" vast amounts of material, little of which is retained by the student.  Discussion formats tend to reduce sharply the amount of pre-digested information that can be presented, but increase dramatically the opportunities for students to absorb the subject matter and make it their own.  Hence, the desirability of getting away from the pattern of lecturing to passive masses who ultimately write an exam as a test of their resemblance to a sponge, and of trying to involve students in daily interaction with the course material and each other, an interaction on which they receive some sort of evaluative feedback. 

          The grading system on the next page grows out of these thoughts, and I would happily receive suggestions for improvement.  As it stands, it has been reworked repeatedly in light of student reactions.

  

**GRADING SYSTEM - Mechanics** ****

          Participation in each course activity earns points.  The point values are set up to encourage students to allocate their energies constructively, and to avoid placing too much weight on any one thing.

          Note that the emphasis is on making some contribution, not on trying to take over the class.  The top score is given both for coming up with some wonderful insight, and for intellectual collaboration with one's classmates.  (For example, "Vanessa makes a really good point about the role of communication, but we can understand the situation even better if we generalize her idea, and consider all the information flows involved.")  If you are about to say something in a class discussion, and it bears no conceivable relationship to what the previous speaker said, why is that?  Were you even listening?  Or were your ears turned off while you rehearsed the brilliant thing you were waiting to say?  And were you even thinking about sharing your ideas with your classmates, or is the instructor the only person whose presence in the room you care about?  Too often, class discussions are really a series of tiny dialogues between the instructor & Student A, the instructor & Student B, etc., as if the rest of the class didn't exist.   
          Like all scoring systems, this one is open to some abuse.  The most common crime is that of imitating a log for the entire class hour, and then, just as the bell rings, springing to life and bestowing on everyone's astonished ears some bit of wisdom, so that one can be said to have contributed to the discussion.  The obvious cure is for the instructor to pay no attention to people who display central nervous system activity only during the last five minutes of class, but then one has to put up with their self-righteous resentment about one's "unfairness" \-- "It took me a while to have something worth saying."  There is no perfect solution.  (Welcome to reality.) 

  
           _ **Short Papers**_ **:**

          Marked in the syllabus as **P #1-9** , these are two-page thought pieces focused on the text being read for that week, and due at the beginning of the relevant class.  They are not meant to be "book reports."  If they simply summarize the work, or describe some obvious feature of it, they will be scored as irrelevant.  These texts are all extremely complex.  You must isolate some feature, some problem, some aspect of the work and do some intelligent thinking about it on paper.

          You will notice that this point scale makes it clear that the emphasis in the course is on day-to-day preparation and involvement, rather than on making some dramatic effort at the end of the semester. 

  **ADDITIONAL INFORMATION**

           **8:00 a.m. supplemental classes:**   This course will not make use of the additional 8:00 a.m. time blocks unless that is made necessary by some unanticipated emergency. 

           **Classes missed, work done late:**   If you are sick (i.e., have gone to the Health Center), the Health Center will notify the Dean of Students Office, which will tell me to make allowances for your illness.  It is the Dean's office notification to me that makes your illness official, while protecting your privacy.   
           Likewise, if you are suffering some personal emergency (the death of a family member is the traditional example), it is not appropriate for me to evaluate its impact on you.  Go talk to the Dean of Students Office, which will notify me officially as to the allowances that should be made.   
 If you are neither sick nor distracted, but merely in a situation where your
academic obligations are not being met on time, it is a matter between the two
of us, rather than an issue for the Dean of Students.  Come and talk to me,
sooner rather than later, and let's work something out.  Don't just ignore the
situation until the end of the semester, and then hope for a grade of
"Incomplete," because I am not authorized to grant one, and the Dean's office
will not be impressed when you appear at the last minute with some sad story.

            **Special personal circumstances:**   You may be in one or more of a large number of special circumstances that the college recognizes officially.  For example, you may be on the **_ski team_** , and condemned to miss Friday classes for the first half of Winter Term.  You may be committed to **_field trips_** that cause you to miss other classes.   It may be that the college has received appropriate certification that you are **_dyslexic_** , or otherwise disadvantaged by some common method of evaluation.  I have to be officially notified of any such situation by the appropriate office of the college, in order to take it into account.  Such official notification is not equivalent to a gift to you of the academic credit involved.  Rather, it is merely an instruction to me to be open to your desire to fulfill your responsibilities in some other fashion.  Discuss any such circumstance with me well in advance of it becoming an issue.  If, for example, you wait until the day before a midterm exam to tell me that you need to have it administered at some other time, or in some other fashion, than previously scheduled, there may be no good resolution. 

           **Academic dishonesty:**   As an enrolled Bates student, you are responsible for being aware of the contents of the "Statement on Plagiarism and A Guide to Source Acknowledgments."  This is an extremely serious matter.  Intellectual honesty is crucial to the entire endeavor of higher education, never mind its importance to the larger society.  If you are unsure as to how these concerns apply to some particular assignment, check with me ahead of time!



**INSTRUCTIONS FOR SHORT PAPERS**

          Long papers and short papers each present specific difficulties.  As a paper grows in length, maintaining the structure and development of the argument becomes more and more demanding.  In short papers, the biggest problem is to get rid of wasted words, and to use the words that are left as effectively as possible.  It is hardly possible to accomplish this without revision, which teaches an important lesson.  One-page papers are particularly useful for learning to organize prose, because the entire structure is visible at all times.  Two-page papers offer far greater flexibility in developing an argument. 

          Please observe the following guidelines for the short paper assignments in this course, unless specifically instructed otherwise: 

          1) Wordprocessed papers are now the minimum acceptable standard.  The technology makes possible a number of options that you should take full advantage of, such as spellchecking.  However, there is no substitute for human proofreading.  Various pathologies that wordprocessing makes possible should be shunned:  old ribbons whose imprint is so light that the text is unreadable (if your paper won't photocopy clearly on a mediocre copier, it is too pale), font sizes that are too small or foolishly large and font styles that are hard to read or silly looking.  Such rules aren't quibbles, they are basic courtesies. 

          2) Think carefully about the need for scholarly documentation of what you are writing.  Many software packages also support specific citation styles.  No one method can deal with all the challenges posed by scholarly documentation, but I recommend that you familiarize yourself with the _MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers_ , which is available in the library and the bookstore (owning a copy of the latest edition is not a bad idea).  Endnotes and/or bibliography should be placed on a separate sheet of paper. 

          3) Establish the topic of your paper _in the first sentence_.   If you have the time, it often works wonders to write your entire paper, remove your glorious concluding sentence, make it the first sentence of a new version, and rewrite from there. 

          4) _One-page papers_ generally work best if divided into three logical paragraphs \-- (a) introduction, (b) development, (c) conclusion.   This rule is sometimes sarcastically described as the doctrine of "Tell the readers what you're going to tell them, tell them, tell them that you've told them."  Such a form can become a mechanical exercise, but if you're going to abandon it, be sure that you know what you are replacing it with.  _Two-page papers_ require more individual thinking to find a structure appropriate to the point you are trying to make.   You do know what that is, right?  If you think you are making several points in two pages, you have already lost control.

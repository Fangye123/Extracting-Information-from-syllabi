## RELN 490  
Senior Seminar in Religious Studies  
Saints and Sages in Comparative Perspective

**Course Description**  
Senior Seminar is designed to offer a culminating experience in your Religious
Studies major. This year's topic will offer opportunities to examine the
phenomenon of sainthood in a variety of religious traditions. Challenging
reading, regular writing assignments and student-led discussions will be the
tools through which the topic is explored. Each week two students will prepare
short, critical essays on the reading under discussion. Two students, but not
those who have written the essays, will prepare to lead discussion for the
first hour of seminar. One student will be the main leader and will receive a
grade. The other student will be responsible for preparing alongside the main
leader and supporting that student's discussion leadership. During this part
of the evening I will simply observe and not participate.

**Senior Exercise**

In addition to this seminar majors are required to complete components
(objective examination, essays and symposia) of the senior exercise during the
course of the year. I have posted important dates within the syllabus for the
senior exercise but you should also consult the Religious Studies website for
fuller details on each component. Beginning this year, majors will be tested
on terms from all traditions taught in the department. You will be given a
terms list and you are encouraged to meet 2-3 times with the other senior
majors or in smaller groups to help each other learn and review terms. This is
an opportunity for each of you to draw on your expertise to help others. The
objective examination will be offered twice this year. The standard essay
option is to write a short essay (12-15 pages) on a topic assigned after
consultation with a faculty member. There is a longer paper option (20-25
pages), subject to approval by the faculty. This is for students who wish to
explore a topic in greater detail. Students who choose this option must submit
their topic proposal, an abstract, bibliography and a list of courses that
have prepared them to write on this subject. Symposia, the final aspect of the
senior exercise, will take place early in the second semester.

**Requirements**

**Writing Assignments:** All writing is due on the day the reading is
discussed. Please review details described in the course description on p. 1.
Missed due dates on longer pieces will result in grade penalties. I do not
consider e-mail requests for extensions. Please plan accordingly. Carefully
read and follow my Guidelines, which will be distributed early in the
semester, and review the College rules on Academic Honesty (see pp. 24-27 in
the Course of Study). Please keep copies of all your writing until it is
graded and returned to you.

> William Strunk and E.B. White's _The Elements of Style_ is recommended
reading for all who are interested in polishing their writing.

**Response essays:** Five 1-2 page, typed essays. (PLEASE SAVE PAPER: single
space, print on both sides of paper if possible; if not, staple or paperclip
your pages together.) These essays should be brief and immediate responses to
the reading. They must be turned no later than 9 a.m. on Mondays (paper
copies, please, no attachments). Late response essays will not be accepted.
(3% each)

**Two essays (4-5 typed pages) for distribution in advance** (20 % each):  
These are due on Sunday evening and will be available for the other students
to pick up by 9:00 a.m. Monday morning. You may submit these essays by e-mail
as an attachment or in hard copy (paper-clipped, not stapled) under my door
but they must be in my hands no later than 8:00 a.m. on Monday morning.
Failure to turn in essays on time will result in an F on that paper.

**Discussion Leadership** (25 %)  
Participation in class discussions (including support for the discussion
leader); no unexcused absences. (20%)

**Office Hours and Communication**  
For brief consultations, please see me before class. I am also available for
longer meetings during my office hours. (TTh 2:45-3:45 and Wed. 1-4). E-mail
is the least preferred form of communication and should be used judiciously.

If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may
affect your ability to carry out assigned course work, I urge you to contact
the Office of Disability Services at 5453. The Coordinator of Disability
Services, Erin Salva ([salvae@kenyon.edu](mailto:Salvae@kenyon.edu)) will
review your concerns and determine, with you, what accommodations are
appropriate. After your meeting with Erin Salva, please see me to discuss
accommodations and learning needs.

This syllabus is a general guideline of what to expect but is NOT written in
stone! Details will change according to the interests of the class, and the
pace of progress made by the groups.  
  
---  
Most classes consist of a combination of small group work and some whole class
discussion or mini lectures. Mini lectures will be based on class interests
and will be given by the instructors and TA's. Tell us what you want! Primary
and secondary articles will be used outinely to supplement the mini-
lectures/discussions and class activities. You should complete Weil's Health
and Healing book and read relevent sections of Fugh-Berman's Alternative
Medicine: What Works as the semester progresses.

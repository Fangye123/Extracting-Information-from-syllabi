  |  Studying History at Shepherd College

* * *

  
    Shepherd's location on the banks of the Potomac and in the lower Shenandoah Valley provides a setting especially conducive to historical study.  The many Native American names on the landscape provide evidence of the earliest dwellers of the area.  The oldest town in West Virginia, Shepherdstown is a living museum of architecture and material culture.  James Rumsey built and operated the first steamboat here, and the contending forces of the Civil War fought the deadliest battle in American history across the river at Antietam.  Three national historical parks are nearby: the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, Harpers Ferry, and Antietam.  Other parks, historical sites, museums, and the major research repositories of the Library of Congress and the National Archives are within a reasonable drive or accessible by commuter train.   
    The department offers a broad range of courses in American, Latin American, European, Asian, and Middle Eastern history.  A concentration is availble in the Civil War and Nineteenth Century America.

**Course Goals:**  
The purpose of this course is to advance your understanding of mediation
through the study of research and theory pertaining to mediation. Students
will develop the communication skills necessary for successful mediation,
learn mediation stages and procedures, and observe mediation in practice.

**Required Course Materials:**  
1\. Moore, C.W. (1996). The mediation process: Practical strategies for
resolving conflict (2nd ed.). San Francisco: Jossey-Bass Publishers.  
2\. VHS videotape

**Classroom Polices:  
1\. Attendance:** Because this is a skills oriented course and because the
information you will learn while attending the course might qualify you to co-
mediate, attendance is mandatory. Many mediation centers require a minimum of
40 hours of training. The material covered in this course corresponds with the
training you would received at a mediation center. Each class meeting will
include a discussion of new material, the practice of that material, and
intensive role-playing. Missing more than one class will result in a deduction
of half a letter grade for every following absence. Missing more than two
classes with disqualify you from receiving mediation certification.

**2\. Due Dates:** All assignments, activities, and quizzes are due on the
date they appear on the course outline. No make-up work will be allowed except
in those circumstances that meet university criteria.

**3\. Assigned Readings:** Readings from the text are listed on the course
outline. Please keep up on the reading. This is a skills oriented class.
Reading the material ahead of time allows us to use class time to develop your
mediation skills.

**4\. All graded work** is to be typed, double-spaced using a font size of 12
with one inch margins. Please proof your work. One point will be deducted for
each spelling, grammar, and mechanical error. Hopefully this will push you to
turn in your best work.

**5\. Academic Accommodations:** If there is any individual in this class who
is in need of academic accommodations and who is registered with to the Office
of Services for Individuals with Disabilities, please make an individual
appointment with me to discuss accommodations. Upon individual request, this
syllabus can be made available in alternative forms. If any individual who is
not registered with the Office of Services for Individuals with Disabilities
but has need of academic accommodations, please contact the Office directly
either in person or on the first floor of the Turley House or by telephone at
(859) 622-1500 V/TTY.

**6\. Academic Misconduct:** Cheating or plagiarizing will not be tolerated
and will result in a  "0" for the assignment and a possible "F" for the
course. Please familiarize yourself with the rules, regulations, and penalties
for academic misconduct as noted in the Student Handbook.

**Description of Graded Assignments:**

**1\. Homework on weekly readings:** You are expected to keep up with assigned
readings and be prepared for in-depth discussions. To aid in this process, you
will be given questions to answer that pertain to the readings. All answers
must be typed.

**2\. Research Paper** (100 points): Each of you will write an 8-10 page
research paper on a specific type of mediation. Examples would be victim-
offender mediation; peer mediation; parent-child mediation; divorce mediation;
mediation in organizations; mediation in other countries; mediating domestic
violence, etc. Pick a topic of interest to you and your career. A minimum of
fifteen sources is required. Papers are to be typed, double spaced, and
written using the APA format (refer to the APA manual in the library or in my
office). A reference list must accompany the paper. Start early! Most of the
material will be in professional journals which might require interlibrary
loan. It can take up to two weeks to get materials ordered through
interlibrary loan. Papers will be graded on content as well as grammar and
spelling. Proofread!

**Items to address in the paper:**  
a. A description and background of the type of mediation (when it's used,
people likely to benefit from this type, etc.).  
b. The mediation stages/procedures used in this type of mediation.  
c. Description of the specific communication skills needed.  
d. Expert's thoughts on the advantages and disadvantages of this type of
mediation.  
e. Your own assessment of this type of mediation

**3\. Self Analysis of Mediation** (100 points): Each of your will be
videotaped conducting a short mediation. Following the mediation, you will
critique your strengths and weaknesses as a mediator according to the
Mediation Evaluation Sheet (which will be handed out at a later date).
Included in your analysis must be suggestions for ways you might have improved
that mediation session. This assignment is worth 100 points. Be sure to use
the text and any classroom materials as support for why you believe something
you did during the mediation was a strength or weakness. Referencing the text
demonstrates to me your understanding of how the material should be applied to
mediation. The paper should be typed, double-spaced, and checked for spelling
and grammatical errors. Assessments are due two weeks from the date your
mediation is videotaped.

**4\. Peer Evaluation of a Mediation** (50 points): Each of you will turn in
your videotaped mediation to me. I will randomly assign the tape to a
classmate. Your classmate will then write up a peer review of your mediation.
You will not know who received your videotape (unless you squeal). Peer
reviews should assess the strengths and weaknesses of the mediator (a handout
detailing the information to critique will be distributed). After I read and
grade your critiques, your critique will go to the person. Anything
identifying you to the critique will be omitted. Honest, constructive feedback
is a must! Critiques are due the date the final examination is scheduled.

**5\. Quizzes:** Quizzes will replace formal examinations in this class. Each
class period will begin with a 10 point quiz that will cover the materials
from the previous week. Questions will be in a variety of formats. Make-up
quizzes will be permitted only for the most serious emergencies as determined
by this instructor. Be prepared to document your excuse.

**Grading Scale:** Final grades will be assigned based upon the following
grading scale:  
A=93% or higher  
A-=90-92%  
B+=87-89%  
B =83-86%  
B-=80-82%  
C+=77-79%  
C =73-76%  
C-=70-72%  
D+=67-69%  
D = 63-66%  
D-=60-62%  
F= 59.4% or lower

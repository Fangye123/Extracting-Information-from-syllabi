Course Description and Objectives:
This course serves as an introduction to American writing. 
We will read a variety of literary forms, some of them 
considered to be uniquely American:exploration and 
encounter narratives, as well as autobiographies, short 
stories, and novels.  I stress that this is not a course 
in literature appreciation; rather, it is an introduction 
to the discipline of literary study.  We use the techniques 
of close reading and structural analysis to read these 
texts as sources of ideas and for understanding literature 
as cultural practice-that is, a "doing" of 
the culture, and not merely an artifact of isolated 
production.  My approach reflects the same understanding 
in that the course itself will be a sort of work-in-progress, 
a dynamic study and exploration not only of the works 
on the syllabus, but also of our own reading them. 
 In addition to its primary objective, the course will 
encourage you to cultivate proficiency in critically 
alert reading, and analytical thinking and writing. 
 Therefore, the class is based on discussion rather 
than on lecture.  You are expected to complete each 
reading assignment on time and to participate in the 
discussion.  The reading and writing schedule is rigorous. 
 Count on spending three hours of work outside class 
for every hour spent in class.  Reading for this class 
means giving your whole attention to the structure, 
the style, and the content: an active and thoughtful 
engagement with the text that enables you to make informed 
interpretations.  In order to participate, you are 
expected to bring the appropriate text to each class.
I have designed the syllabus to accomplish these various, 
perhaps conflicting, certainly complex, goals.  Our 
focus is on the nineteenth century.  Further, these 
works comprise to a greater or lesser extent a literature 
of conquest: each selection represents a personal or 
cultural vision imposed on the land. --What vision, 
whose vision, will determine the shape of the land, 
the formation of the peoples and cultures that live 
on it, the form of the literature we call American?

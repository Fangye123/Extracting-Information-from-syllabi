This course examines the most recent and provocative works in the
history of family life, sexual behaviors and gender studies in
the United States from the colonial period to the present.  The
primary emphasis concerns the impact of social and political
change on gender roles and sexual behavior.  Particular attention
is paid to changing standards of sexual morality and their effect
upon the structure and organization of the American family and
physical intimacy over the past three and one half centuries.  As
American institutions and demographics changed, so did gender
roles, ideological standards of morality, and the boundaries of 
sexual behavior. This course seeks to discover and define these
changes and thereby better comprehend the ongoing transformation
of gender and sexuality in the United States.  The course is
chronologically structured and interwoven with topical themes,
beginning with the colonial period and ending with contemporary
America.  The more important topics include theories of sexual
and gender behavior, cultural constructions of gender roles, the
evolution of birth control and abortion, the role of medicine
and politics in defining appropriate norms and forms of
sexuality, alternative communities defined by sexual behavior,
and so-called "deviant" forms of sexuality. 

The course requirements include one 20- to 25-page typewritten
essay (50%), an oral report (25%) and class participation (25%). 
Essay guidelines can be found at the end of this syllabus.  A
primary responsibility of students is to complete the weekly
reading before the date of the scheduled class and contribute
their thoughtful, reflective opinions in class discussion.  The
readings can be interpreted in a variety of ways and students
should formulate some initial positions and questions to offer in
the class discussion.  For every article or book, students should
be prepared to answer all of the questions found in the "Critical
Reading" section of the syllabus below.  All required readings
may be purchased at Barnes & Noble Bookstore in the Granada
Center on Sheridan Road.  Students do not have to buy any of the
books since each one has been placed on reserve at Cudahy
Library. 

Students who are disabled or impaired should meet with the
professor within the first two weeks of the semester to discuss
the need for any special arrangements.

DISCUSSIONS AND CRITICAL READING 
Discussion and class participation is an important part of
student evaluation (25 percent).  Incisive, imaginative and
thoughtful comments that generate and facilitate discussion are
weighed heavily in final grades.  Asking questions, responding to
student questions and contributing to an ongoing discussion are a
necessary part of the learning experience.  Failure to speak in
class only lowers a student's final grade.  Discussions take
place in every class period, each worth 2 "points."  Students
will receive 0 points for nonparticipation, 1 point for minimal
participation, and 2 points for active participation.  Students
who raise questions that generate discussion will earn extra
points.

The best ways to prepare for and contribute to class discussion
are: 1) complete the reading on time, and 2) critically analyze
the reading.  The primary goal of critical reading is to find the
author's interpretation and what evidence and influences led to
that conclusion.  Never assume a "passive" position when reading
a text.  If students ask and attempt to answer the following
questions, they will more fully comprehend and understand any
reading. 

1.  What is the thesis of the author?

2.  Does the author have a particular stated or unstated point of
view?  How does the author construct their argument?  Are the
author's goals, viewpoints, or agendas revealed in the
introduction or preface?   Does the author provide evidence to
support the argument?  Is it the right evidence?  In the final
analysis, do you think the author proves the argument or does the
author rely on preconceived views or personal ideology?  Why do
you think that?

3.  Does the author have a moral or political posture?  Is it
made explicit or implicit in the way the story is told?  What is
the author's view of human nature?  Does change come from human
agency and "free will" or broad socio-economic forces?

4.  What assumptions does the author hold about society?  Does
the author see society as hierarchical, pluralistic, democratic
or elitist?  Does the author present convincing evidence to
support this view?

5.  How is the narrative constructed or organized?  Does the
author present the story from the viewpoint of a certain
character or group?  Why does the author begin and end at certain
points?  Is the story one of progress or decline?  Why does the
author write this way?

6.  What issues and events does the author ignore?  Why?  Can you think of alternative interpretations or stories that might
present a different interpretation?  Why does the author ignore
certain events or facts?

ORAL REPORTS 
The oral report constitutes 25 percent of the final grade.  The
purpose of the assignment is to facilitate and broaden class
discussion by introducing various critiques of the readings. 
Each week, one student will be responsible for identifying,
reading, analyzing, synthesizing and summarizing as many reviews
and critiques of that week's reading(s) as possible.  For the
report, students should locate reviews in at least the following
publications:  American Historical Review,  Journal of
American History,  Feminist Studies,  Journal of the
History of Sexuality ,  Journal of Social History ,
 Journal of Interdisciplinary History ,  Journal of
American Studies ,  The Historian ,  Gender and
History ,  Journal of Women's History ,  Reviews in
American History ,  Social Science History , and
 Journal of Family History.  Some books will require
searching for reviews in more specialized journals, such as
 Journal of Southern History ,  Journal of Negro
History ,  William and Mary Quarterly ,  Journal of
Urban History , and other regionally- or state-defined
publications.  Some works will have reviews in news magazines and
book reviews such as the  New York Times Book Review , the
 Nation ,  Atlantic Monthly , and other national
publications.

The oral report should: 1) BRIEFLY synthesize and summarize the
reviews, 2) critically examine the reviews in terms of their
ideology, methodology, and other forms of bias, and 3) comment on
the accuracy and fairness of the reviews based on their own
reading of the work under discussion for that week.  The
questions employed in the critical reading section above should
be applied to the oral report assignment.  Students will usually
(but not always) present the report in the middle in the class,
whenever it facilitates discussion.  The report should take
approximately 10 to 15 minutes.  UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHOULD
THE REPORT EXCEED 15 MINUTES.  Oral report assignments will be
made in the introductory class.

 ESSAYS 
The essay requirement serves several purposes.  First, good,
thoughtful writing disciplines and educates the mind.  To write
well, one must think well.  If one's writing improves, so does
their thinking and intelligence.  Second, students personally
experience on a first-hand basis some form of historical writing. 
A research paper relying on primary sources exposes students to
the challenges, difficulties and even contradictions of analyzing
historical events.  Ideally, students will think more
"historically" as a result of the exercise. Third, the essay can
serve as an early draft of a publishable article.  All students
should have such a goal in mind when conceiving of, writing and
rewriting the essay.

Two types of long essays are acceptable for this course: research
and historiographical.  Research essays analyze a specific topic
using primary or original sources.  Examples of primary sources
include (but are not limited to) newspapers, diaries, letters,
oral interviews, books published during the period under study,
manuscript collections, and old maps.  A research essay relies on
source material produced by the subject or by institutions and
individuals associated in some capacity with the subject.  The
use and immersion of the writer/researcher in such primary and
original sources is often labeled "doing history."  Most of the
articles and books assigned for class discussion represent this
type of historical writing.

Historiographical essays are based upon at least ten different
secondary sources, or what historians have written about a
subject.  Such a paper examines how historians' interpretations
have differed and evolved over time regarding a specific topic or
theme.  The major focus of a historiographical essay are the
ideas of historians, how they compare with each other and how
they have changed over time.  Examples and models for such essays
can be found in the following collections:  

Louis Masur, ed.,  The Challenge of American History
(Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1999); originally
 Reviews in American History, vol. 26, no. 1 (March 1998).

Eric Foner, ed.,  The New American History(Philadelphia:
Temple Univ. Press, 1990), especially essays in part II.

Both types of assignments should be the length of a standard
scholarly article (approximately 15-20 typewritten pages of text,
plus notes).  Students should select a topic as soon as possible,
in consultation with the instructor.  A preliminary bibliography
which includes books, articles, oral interviews, or other
possible sources should be completed and handed in by 3 p.m.,
Thursday, 8 February 2001.

All essays should be typed.  Students who complete the essay
early have the option to rewrite the paper upon its evaluation
and return (remember - the only good writing is good rewriting). 
For students who wish to have the option of rewriting the essay,
TWO copies of the first draft of the essay should be in the
professor's possession by 3 p.m., Thursday, 29 March 2001.  All
other and rewritten essays are due on Tuesday, 24 April 2001 by
1:00 p.m. (please note this is NOT a day the class meets).  On
both dates, students should submit TWO copies of the essay. 
Students who rewrite the essay should also include the corrected
first draft.

All final papers should be free of typographical errors,
misspellings and grammatical miscues.  For every eight such
mistakes, the essay's grade will be reduced by a fraction (A to
A-, A- to B+, etc.). Essays are to be written for this class
ONLY. No essay used to fulfill the requirements of a past or
current course may be submitted.   Failure to follow this rule
will result in an automatic grade of F for the assignment. 
Extensions are granted automatically.  However, grades on essays
handed in 48 hours (or more late) will be reduced by a fraction
(A to A-, A- to B+, etc.). Every three days thereafter another
fraction will be dropped from the paper's final grade.

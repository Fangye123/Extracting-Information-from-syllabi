Overview  
Welcome to Community Journalism, also known as J352. World War II continues to
fascinate, more than 50 years after its conclusion. While there have been
several excellent books and other accounts about the war and its effects,
there has been scant attention paid to U.S. Latinos and Latinas and how the
war affected their lives. Yet, in Texas, where Hispanics comprise about 30
percent of the population, World War II had great and lasting consequences.
This class will concentrate on Latinos of the World War II era who can be
interviewed. We will interview them, using the best equipment available to us,
seeking to understand what life was like before the war, during the war and
after the war.

Course Objectives  
The goal of this class is for you to learn several skills that will help
produce Narratives, a tabloid-size newspaper, and Narratives Online, a Web
site about these men and women. Among those skills:  
* basic oral history techniques, including interviewing   
* how to research and prepare for an interview   
* how to record your interviews on video   
* how to digitize photos for both our paper and our Web publications   
* how to create a Web page with digital video   
* how to write and edit news stories for both print and the Web.   
On a daily basis, we'll discuss story ideas, graphics, ethics, which includes
representation of different groups of people. Hopefully you'll get a better
appreciation of why you are being asked to do certain things \- and why news
operations do things certain ways. Throughout the semester, we'll emphasize
production, critiquing and deadline performance. We'll also emphasize
throughout the semester making use of any and all resources available to us on
the Internet and in other handy locations.

Assignments and Examinations  
There will be 10 assignments - some to be completed within the lab and others
to be done outside and turned in at a set date. I will make available to you a
grading sheet that will show you exactly how your teaching assistant and I
arrive at your grade for the assignment. However, I reserve the right to
change assignments or deadlines at any time if a better opportunity for you
presents itself or if we decide that we need to make changes to better suit
our production schedule. There will be no examinations. All of your work will
be connected in some way to the production of the tabloid newspaper Narratives
and the Web site, <http://www.utexas.edu/projects/latinoarchives/narratives>
by the same name.

Required Reading  
You may purchase your course packet at Longhorn Copies, across the street at
2520 Guadalupe. The readings come from several different sources. One of your
first assignments will be to make a presentation based on one key aspect of
the World War II experience. For that, you will be required to build on what
you found in your readings. Readings are taken from:  
* Charlton, Thomas L. Oral History for Texans, Texas Historical Commission, 1985.   
* Hogg, Ian V. Tanks. Minneapolis, Minn.: Lerner Publications Co., 1985.   
* Kennedy, David M. Freedom from Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945. New York: Oxford University Press. 1999.   
* Montejano, David. Anglos and Mexicans in the Making of Texas, 1836-1986. Austin: UT Press, 1987.   
* Quinn, George Q. The Draft, 1940-1973 Lawrence, Kansas: University of Kansas Press, 1993.   
Because this is a journalism class, we will be required to read the Austin
American-Statesman daily (including weekends) and the Daily Texan five days a
week. We will be on a constant lookout for stories that might inform our
project.

Other Required Materials  
Please bring to class:  
* two Zip disks, either Mac or PC-formatted. These will contain your written work, as well as the photographs you will scan for Narratives and our Web publication.   
* One PC-formatted 4.5 computer diskette, if you want to try out a digital still camera to take a current photo of your interview subject.   
* enough high-quality video tapes (probably Hi8, but you may check out a camera that is other than a Hi8) to record your interview.   
* 4 six-hour high-quality VHS video tapes, one for the class dub and the other a dub that you may send to your interview subject.   
* 3 high-quality audio tapes with screw-type corners (not longer than 45 minutes per side). It is essential that you get the right kind of tapes. We recommend Maxell UR IEC Type 1, but if you have another high-quality tape with the screw corners, that's fine.   
* a stenographic pad, or other type of notepad for class notes and your interviews

please explain your questions in writing immediately. I will attempt to
resolve the matter within 48 hours and provide you a written response.

Attendance  
We'll be covering much ground in short order. Also, some guest speakers will
pop in without much advance notice to you, and you'll want to hear from some
real practicing journalists. It's in your best interest to be here punctually
every day.

Academic Honesty  
As far as academic honesty, there are University rules on the subject.
Basically, the University and your instructors want you to do your own work.
There's a wonderful Web page that explains the finer points at
<http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/sjs/>  If you have any doubts about something
you're doing or thinking about doing, read about it and then let's talk about
it.

Enough Already! I want you to get out of this class as much as you can. This
will be a safe and gentle learning environment - it's not what you know now
that will make the difference. It's how you build on what you learn here that
will count years from now. If you need help, let me know right away and we'll
decide - together - what we can do.

**Course Format**

Students are placed with an approved institution of their choice for a full-
time (fifteen week) block placement. In some circumstances a split placement
between different sites and/or departments may be arranged. Planning and
discussion periods will be scheduled as required.

The student works under the direction of the host institution on activities,
projects, and artifact treatments which serve to benefit both parties
mutually.

The success of the internship is dependent on the co-operation and
collaboration of the three partners: the intern, the college and the site.

**Intern Responsibilities**

The intern is accountable for the following:

  * confirming start and finish dates with faculty and the site supervisor and notifying them of any changes; 
  * conforming to the site work week and hours of operation and responding to special needs as required; 
  * developing a learning contract and work plan in co-operation with the host site and college faculty and forwarding this for approval to the college; 
  * consulting with college faculty on work status and progress, on a _regular_ basis; 
  * adhering to recognised codes of ethics; 
  * producing work to the highest possible standard of a quality acceptable to the site and supervisor; 
  * demonstrating a lively and professional interest in the site and the operations of the institution; 
  * carrying out responsibilities with goodwill and a positive attitude; 
  * seeking guidance, as required; ask if in doubt 
  * accepting feedback gracefully, even though it may not always be positive; 
  * discussing any perceived work-related problems with the site co-ordinator and college intern liaison as they may arise; 
  * being sensitive to the needs and demands placed on the site staff and using their time appropriately; 
  * adhering to site policies and procedures; and specifically: 
  * using health and safety clothing and equipment, if required; 
  * complying with site health and safety regulations; 
  * reporting any accidents which require medical attention to the college within 24 hours. 
  * maintaining a journal which _briefly_ documents the high points and low points of placement activity, (eg. activities, responsibilities, challenges and resolutions). The journal should be a vehicle for self-assessment and a record of existing strengths and weaknesses in terms of skills and knowledge base. 
  * Journal entries must be submitted every two weeks or more frequently if preferred. The journals are the primary means of the intern liaison understanding the content, pacing and progress of the internship. They must be submitted in order to receive a passing grade from the course. Journal entries may be e-mailed or faxed as well as mailed. 
  * writing a letter of thanks to the site and site supervisor(s) at the end of the internship. Please c.c. your supervisor's superior and file a copy with the intern liaison. 

**Site Responsibilities**

The site is responsible for:

  * appointing a supervisor to whom the students reports and is directly accountable; 
  * developing a learning contract/work plan with the intern; 
  * maintaining a liaison with the college; 
  * providing the intern with clear guidance and direction, as required; 
  * providing the student with appropriate, honest and frequent feedback; 
  * ensuring the student's time is used appropriately and well; 
  * being responsive to students needs and abilities; 
  * assisting students develop an understanding and overview of the institutional operation, day to day activities and resources and constraints; 
  * completing written assessments for the college; and specifically: 
  * providing an orientation to site health and safety procedures; 
  * providing safety equipment and/or clothing if required; 
  * ensuring the student receives appropriate training in use of special tools and equipment and handling, storage and disposal of toxic substances; 
  * ensuring the student is familiar with key policies and procedures relating to site security, public safety, etc. 

Host institutions are asked to assist students by providing them with access
to information (eg library resources) and as wide an experience as possible.

**College Responsibilities**

Faculty are responsible for:

  * assisting students locate and plan field placements; 
  * consulting with students in the development of learning contracts and reviewing them periodically throughout the placement; 
  * being available to students for consultation throughout the placement; 
  * visiting the students as required (except at remote sites); during the semester 
  * maintaining phone/written contact with the supervisor during the placement; 
  * problem solving, negotiating, as required; 
  * assigning final grades to students based on interpretation of the assessment tools. 

**Learning Sequence** :

NB: For those students who have negotiated different start dates, please
transpose the placement activity to your own calendar and provide a written
copy to college faculty.

Unless otherwise noted, materials submitted to the college should be mailed,
or faxed, to arrive by the Friday of the week in which they are missed.

**Assessment Plan** :

Generic skills as outlined above are embedded in the assessment:

**A. SITE SUPERVISOR'S ASSESSMENT** : 30% of total grade (based on a mid-
semester and final assessment, each assessment worth 15%)

The site supervisor will be asked to provide verbal feedback on the student's
work and performance periodically during the placement. In addition, the
supervisor is requested to complete a written assessment of the student at the
completion of the placement. Detailed criteria for assessment and forms will
be provided by the college. The assessment will be based on the extent to
which the student has fulfilled the responsibilities described in the course
outline as well as the level of satisfaction with the specific outcomes of the
learning contract.

**B. COLLEGE INTERN LIAISON** : 10% of total grade (based on activity
throughout the placement and awarded at the end of the semester)

Faculty are responsible for interpreting and assessing student performance at
the site. Criteria for assessment include the extent to which the student has
met the responsibilities described in the outline as well as the outcomes of
the learning contract. Faculty will work with site supervisors in assessing
the student level of performance. In order to ensure that faculty have enough
information to work with, students should ensure that they sustain regular
contact. Calls can be returned at the college's expense if there is a problem
with costs at the site.

**C. LEARNING CONTRACT** : 10% of final grade

Due Week 2 or 3. See the internship manual for details.

**D. RESEARCH PROPOSAL:** 10% of total grade, due week 4 (A proposal must be
submitted and approved by the Intern Liaison before proceeding with the actual
research project/report. See details below.)

**E. STUDENT FINAL REPORT** : 10% (due promptly for the end of week 15)

This final report is designed to assist students in subsequent years to select
and develop a field placement. The report could take a number of forms, but
must include:

  * name of site 
  * a brief description of site and scope of activity 
  * a copy of the learning contract and work plan 
  * your assessment of the placement - in particular, areas in which you might have been better prepared; high points, low points; the type of student who might best suite the placement; etc. 

The final report should be a maximum of two-three pages in length, with work
plans and:

  * Any other materials which may assist the college supervisor gaining an understanding of the placement context, eg. institutional mission, policy and procedures; 
  * A record of absences, if any, from the placement as well as additional activity. 

**F. STUDENT RESEARCH PROJECT/REPORT** : 30% of total grade (proposal is due
at the end of week 4, and completed reports must be submitted by the end of
week 13 _at the latest_ , to ensure adequate marking time).

Detailed guidelines for the project are included in the Internship Manual.
Please refer to these for the information on the specific format, expectations
and criteria for assessment.

The framework for all projects should be based on the following:

  * identification of an area of special interest already included in the learning contract 
  * selecting one aspect of the above, developing a focus and establishing a manageable activity/project of use to the site and which provides a vehicle for additional research and original thinking 
  * some additional research activity beyond that which is site based (eg. this may take the form of telephone interviews, observation, site visits, Internet/literature searches, comparative study, etc) 
  * documentation of all aspects the project/activity including methodology, results, recommendations, etc 

This project _should not_ put any extraordinary pressure on the student or the
host site. Students are encouraged to approach the paper as a vehicle for
presentation or publication. Students must consult with sites regarding
copyright and disclosure of information. Faculty recognise that some sites may
have better libraries and resources than others, thus fitting the project to
the resources available is key to success.

Final reports will be filed in the college. Please submit _two_ copies of the
paper to the college, one for comments and one for the programme to keep on
file. A _third_ copy must be filed with the site. As late in the semester is a
very busy time in the academic year, papers _must_ be submitted on time. This
means the scope of your activity should be manageable within the 15 week time
frame. Students should keep a _fourth copy_ for their own portfolio.

**Academic Responsibilities** :

**Course Policy**

I Students must be registered in the field practice course before going to
their placements in order to be covered by the college liability, WCB or
accident insurance.

II Placements may, in extraordinary circumstances, be terminated for a number
of reasons. These include:

  1. Non-compliance with assigned tasks, duties and responsibilities as determined and documented by the Site Supervisor in conjunction with college representatives. 
  2. Consistently poor performance with respect to assigned tasks, duties and responsibilities as determined and documented by the site supervisor. 
  3. Consistent tardiness or absenteeism from the site as determined and documented by the site supervisor. 
  4. Violation of Internship policies and procedures as determined and documented by faculty supervisors. 
  5. Inappropriate and unprofessional behaviour in dealings with the collection, staff or public, as determined and documented by faculty. 
  6. Inappropriate intern setting as determined and documented by the intern and faculty support and in conjunction with the Site Supervisor. 

Due process for termination is available in the manual.

III Absenteeism Policy

The student will be expected to conform to the regular working hours and
vacation schedule of the host institution.

A good attendance record is an integral part of the internship experience.
However, it is also understood that students may need to be absent from their
placements for reasons of accident, illness or family emergency. The following
policy applies:

  1. In the instance of students on full-time internships, they may be absent for a maximum of five days per semester without having to compensate for loss of time. Students are required to notify supervisors of impending absence as soon as is reasonably possible. (It is, however, also recognized that intern projects require the full-time allotment for satisfactory completion.) 
  2. In cases where a student requires leave for more than this amount of time, the situation will be discussed with site and faculty supervisors. In some cases it will be expected that students be required to make up the time. 
  3. Students are required to maintain a record of all absences.  
A student Code of Conduct will be provided in addition to the information
listed above. (Refer to CCM Internship Manual section on policies and Appendix
A)

  4. There are some minor variances in student start and completion dates. Despite this variation, all students should conform to the due dates as stated, which allow for adequate preparation and completion of assignments. 

**Late Assignments**

As part of the Centre for Community Development and Health, the CCM program
will implement the centre policy on late assignments. Late assignments will be
penalized 10% per day for three days, after which a grade of zero will be
given. All assignments must be submitted in order for students to achieve a
passing grade. Faculty are not obligated to provide feedback on assignments
marked at zero.

It is the student's responsibility to contact College faculty well in advance
if difficulties arise.

**Collections Conservation & Management**

1\. **Presentation**

  * Written assignments must be: 
  * typed or word-processed 
  * double spaced 
  * proofed for spelling and grammatical errors 
  * enclosed with a single cover sheet which includes student name, title of the assignment and date of submission 
  * stapled in the top left hand corner (unbound) 
  * include a bibliography (where appropriate) 
  * use a recognized method of citation (eg. MLA or Chicago) 

2\. **Re-writes**

Faculty may request a re-write of a submission if the criteria for assessment
have not been met. Late penalties will apply if the assignment is not re-
submitted the following day.

3\. **Penalties for Late Submissions**

_Completion of Term Work_

  * All assignments must be completed in order for students to achieve a passing grade. 

**_Late Assignments_**

Late assignments receive the following penalty:

  * Marks will be deducted at the rate of 10% per day for three days after which assignments are marked at zero. 
  * Faculty are not obliged to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero. 

**_Oral Presentations_**

  * Oral presentations and/or practical test or projects for evaluation must be delivered on the day scheduled. A "no-show" will be graded at zero, unless adequate explanation is provided. 

4\. **Academic Integrity**

Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity and the college has a
strict policy on this issue (see Academic Regulations).

  * It is a student's responsibility to ensure that all written submissions include an appropriate method of in text citation as well as an accompanying bibliography. 
  * Seminar and oral presentations should be supported by a bibliography and sources should be referred to during the presentation. 

5\. **Make-up Tests**

In valid circumstances (ill-health, personal crisis), a student may be given a
make-up test to compensate for one missed in class-time. Students must contact
the instructor within seven days of the original test in order to request a
make-up.

6\. **Extensions & GDFS**

  * An extension may be granted to an individual student based on need and circumstance. Medical grounds should be substantiated. 
  * The revised due date will be recorded and signed by both parties. 
  * The entire class may be given an extension, at the discretion of faculty. 
  * Incomplete a Grade Deferred marks at the end of the semester must be negotiated between student and faculty (see Academic Regulations). Note: these are a privilege to be granted under special circumstances, not used in order to compensate for poor planning. 

7\. **Site Work**

Students must agree to work within the parameters of the guidelines
established for site work. Failure to comply, may result in the termination of
project and suspension of the privilege of access.

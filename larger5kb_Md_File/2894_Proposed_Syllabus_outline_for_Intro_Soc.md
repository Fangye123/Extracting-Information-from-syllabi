**Introduction** :

This class should provide students with hands-on experience in three areas of
applied social research: ethnography, archival/historical, and quantitative
analysis of survey data. This class is based around three projects. All
students will complete all three projects. Some projects are done in groups,
others may be done individually. Given the 3 week time frame for each project,
completed projects are not expected to be masterpieces, but rather students
are expected to explore new ideas about how the social world can be studied.

Readings are provided to give examples of how research can be done
(ethnographies by Geertz and Goffman; historical essays by Davidson and
Lytle), to provide some practical advice for and a language for research
(texts by Babbie and Davidson), and as a technical reference (STATA manuals
and CPS documentation). There are no exams.



Successful student projects will contain 4 features:

* An attempt to test a stated hypothesis, with some reference to the theoretical ideas found in the assigned readings.

* The most important element of a good project is an explanation of how you did your research and what you found out.

* A brief map of how research might proceed if given more time and resources

* Some insight into the inherent limitations of the method for testing the stated hypothesis (learning about the limitations of research is as important as learning how to do research).

**Project 1: Archival/ Historical**

This syllabus provides general suggestions about the assignments. Specific
information and requirements for the proposal and the paper are posted on my
website, [www.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe](www.stanford.edu/~mrosenfe).

The assigned readings from this class are all from Davidson and Lytle's
marvelous textbook _After the Fact_. The key to a successful historical
project is the additional reading that each student will do. The more time you
spend in the library and in the archives, looking at sources, hunting down
citations from bibliographies, and trying to make sense of different
perspectives, the more successful you project will be. Each chapter of _After
the Fact_ discusses one event or controversy or trend in American history,
with a substantial bibliography. Davidson and Lytle's book will help you learn
how to think like a historian: what is the evidence? Who was the author and
what was his or her intended audience? What kinds of filters of censorship,
self- censorship or bias do you need to consider? In some ways, a good
historian is like a homicide detective. The historical record provides clues
and witnesses, and the historian has to figure out 'who dunnit' and why.

The goal of the project is to find at least 2 sources (at least one of them
primary) that describe a particular political, social, or historical event.
Students will explore how the different sources provide different or
overlapping perspectives on the event. You may choose any kind of historical
event (political or social in nature) you like, but the event must be
pre-1975. Written reports will be evaluated based on creativity in finding
sources, imaginative use of sources, and on a theoretically grounded analysis
of what the sources mean. Final reports should be 7-12 pages in length. The
project proposal should be a 1-2 page explanation of what historical event you
plan to examine, with a preliminary bibliography of the availability and
suitability of sources.

**Resources:**

Stanford library has at least 4 different branches that you will need to know
about

1) Green library. See the reference librarians with questions. Also Malgorzata
Schaefer (mschaefe@leland.stanford.edu) is the instructional librarian, and we
may ask her to give an orientation to the class. Green library has newspapers
and magazines on microfilm, and the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature,
which can help you locate magazine articles about a certain subject. The
newspapers are useful for getting the dates and names and places of events-
start with the printed newspaper indices. Famous figures may have their papers
published in edited volumes, and these would appear in Green (Booker T.
Washington's papers, for instance, are here).

2) Green library special collections. Green library has a small special
collection room, but this room has some collections that may be useful or
interesting, like the papers of Huey P. Newton, Project South, and the Civil
War Diaries. See <http://www-sul.stanford.edu/depts/spc/spc.html>

3) Hoover Archives. The Hoover archives has one of the world's great
collections of materials on 20th century politics, war, and peace. The Hoover
archive librarian Elena Danielson (danielson@hoover.stanford.edu) is eager to
help students, and looks forward to responding to your inquiries. She has
provided a long list of ideas for research, which are listed below under
'choosing an historical event..'

4) The Hoover library (separate and distinct from the Hoover archives).
Librarians Molly Molloy (molloy@hoover.stanford.edu) or Linda Weaver, are very
helpful, and look forward to helping students find cool materials. The Hoover
library specializes in 20th century materials on war, conflict and revolution.
They have, according to the librarians, lots of material on World War I
(including US reaction and, supposedly, dissent) as well as the Spanish Civil
War, the Chinese Revolution, the Nuremberg Trials, WWII Japanese

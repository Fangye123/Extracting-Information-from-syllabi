# HUHI 7320:  
Sex and Gender  
in Late Victorian Britain  
  
---|---  
  
* * *

  
In the wake of scholars as different as Steven Marcus, Michel Foucault, and
Martha Vicinus, historians have come to see the final decades of the
nineteenth century as a crucial period in the development of modern sexual and
gender identities and norms. The 1880s and 1890s witnessed struggles to
formulate and enact new forms of sociability--such as independent women,
marriage between equals, and both "heterosexual" and "homosexual" identities
--that are fundamental to our contemporary sense of self. As a consequence, a
major concern of cultural historians of late nineteenth-century Europe has
been to explore how people at the time understood sexuality and gender--
especially as these were evidenced and imagined in literature.  
  
This reading course, focused on the example of Great Britain between 1880 and
1910, is designed to introduce students to important examples of this period's
varied constructions of sexuality and gender. Our reading will center on
popular fiction--including the Four Horsemen of the _fin de si ecle_ (Dr.
Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, Dorian Gray, Dracula)--but will also include poetry,
journalism, and early sexology. We will examine cultural figures as diverse as
the New Woman, the colonial explorer, the sexual invert, the "white slave,"
Jack the Ripper and Sherlock Holmes. The course aims as well to introduce
students to recent critical scholarship on this material.

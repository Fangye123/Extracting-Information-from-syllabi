**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**

Introduction to Computers

Computer applications for the editing, management, composition, processing and
storage of information, providing experience with professional and/or
educational software packages for word-processing, spreadsheet, database
management, graphics and statistics.

**_OBJECTIVES_**

Students will be able to demonstrate a working knowledge of the following:

  * A brief perspective of the personal computer, how it evolved and relates to other types of computers.
  * Basic hardware components that make up a personal computer system and how they function.
  * Operating systems; how they relate to hardware and software applications, including:
    1. The ability to use common operating systems to move, copy, delete and edit files and filenames.
    2. The ability to organize hard disks (volumes) and subdirectories (folders) efficiently.
  * Software applications:
    1. Different types of applications and purposes.
    2. Use a basic variety at an elementary level.
    3. Create, edit, save and retrieve files.
    4. Understand different file types and, where appropriate, file extensions.
    5. Move information between applications and platforms.
  * Basic Internet and networking applications and principles.
  * How to economically use available resources to learn how to learn more about computing. Learn how to keep up with evolving technology.

**_TEXTBOOK_**

[_Computer Confluence: Exploring Tomorrow's Technology_](text01.htm), (August
1998), by George Beekman (Menlo Park, CA, Benjamin/Cummings, 1997) (ISBN:
0201438550)

**_SUPPLIES_**

3.5", DSHD Floppy Disks | You will be required to purchase a package of 10
3.5", DSHD disks. These will be used to complete in-class assignments and to
turn in work. All disks must have your name on them. Also, all disks should be
backed up and you are responsible for having back up copies of your work. If a
disk is not readable, that is not acceptable as an excuse for not turning in
an assignment.  
---|---  
9x12 or 10x12 Manila Envelopes | All assignments, that include floppies, must
be turned in in sealed 9x12 or 10x12 Manila envelopes. Loose floppies will not
be accepted. These envelopes need to have your name on them, the date and
description of the assignment. Any pages of assignments must be stapled in the
order they need to be read. Each page should have your name on it.  
  
**_COURSE STRUCTURE_**

The class meets for approximately 1.3 hours. The time is generally used for a
mix of lecture, demonstration, quizzes, other typical classroom activities
well as for lab work, practice and completing class work.

The exact balance of lecture/lab may change as the semester evolves. Sometimes
the time may be used mostly for lecture. There may be other times when there
is no lecture and the whole time is set aside for lab. The material you will
be graded on will be covered in the lectures, text, lab and web based
handouts.

**_GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACE (Windows/Mac "GUI")_**

It's a GUI (Win95&98/NT4, MacOS) world out there. There will be minimal
coverage of Win 3.11, OS2 and non-GUI environments such as DOS. The emphasis
will be on modern GUI operating systems (OS's) and programs with coverage of
older systems mostly to show how they evolved into the modern OS's and some of
the legacy quirks in the modern OS's that still exist as hold-overs from older
OS's (such as file extensions.)

**_GRADES_**

I hope everybody _earns_ an  "A".

Grades will be calculated on a points system:

over 100% | A+  
---|---  
88-100% | A  
77-87% | B  
67-76% | C  
60-66% | D  
less than 60% | F  
  
Grading is performance based. Grades will be awarded based on the total
average of:

Average of Midterm Exam and Final Project | 33%  
---|---  
Average of Assignments | 33%  
Average of Quizzes | 33%  
  
**_TESTS_**

Detailed information will be available before exam and quizzes to allow time
to study. Exam will be comprehensive to date of exam. Tests will be closed
book.

**_COMMITMENT_**

Learning how to use a computer is like learning how to drive. When you are
learning, those who practice the most, learn the fastest and are most
comfortable with it. After awhile it becomes second nature. Students are
encouraged to use computers outside of the lab. Be aware of the dangers of
viruses, know that what you do outside of the lab may not be compatible with
what we have in the lab, but please, _practice all you can!_

I think this class will have something in it for everyone, even those who
"know" computers. Hopefully it will be fun and a challenge. Knowing how to use
a computer is increasingly a basic survival skill in our society, again like
knowing how to drive.

Like driving, there are scientific principles that need to be understood to
keep your car under control, rules of the road that must be followed and some
mechanical skills you need to know to be a good driver. For example, you need
to know a bit about how the car works to keep it maintained. A car will not go
forever without gas, oil and air in the tires.

Unlike driving, computer competency is a skill set that demands constant
updating of old skills and the ongoing learning of new skills. With computers
things change very fast. Professionals today have to have a commitment to
dealing with a constantly changing technological environment. This is a
commitment to life long learning. It's a life style that cannot be avoided, if
we are to be competitive, professional and marketable.

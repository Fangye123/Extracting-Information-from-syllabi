Course Description: History 203 is the third of a three-term sequence and
offers a survey of United States history from the Progressive Era to the
Reagan Era. Themes to be explored include the rise of conservation, the
activist state, Progressive reform, war and continued imperialistic foreign
policy, the Great Depression and the New Deal, the Grand Alliance of the
Second World War, Cold War tensions, the Civil Rights movement of the 50s and
60s, Vietnam and Watergate, and the rise of conservatism in the United States.

Course Materials: There are two basic bodies of material for the course, each
of equal importance:

  1. Lectures 
  2. Survey textbook (Davidson et al, _Nation of Nations_ ) 

Lectures have been designed, and readings selected, to offer the best possible
coverage of the period without unnecessary duplication. This means you cannot
rely on just one of the two groups, you must deal effectively with both. In
particular, do not assume that you will be successful in this course by merely
attending class sessions and taking notes. You will be examined on material
contained only in the textbook or only in lectures. However, your most
important work in the course will take place outside the classroom.

Students are responsible for all material contained in lectures and readings.

Class Attendance: Since lectures will not simply duplicate material in the
textbook, and since the summer term moves at a faster pace, attendance at each
lecture is vitally important. Students are responsible for announcements and
changes to the syllabus made in class. Consult other students concerning such
changes if you must miss or are late for a session. Do not rely on the
professor's off-hand memory.

Students experiencing continuing medical or other unusual difficulty should
consult with both the professor (by phone or e-mail) and with the Dean of
Student Affairs. Documentation regarding medical absence must be presented to
the professor as soon as possible after returning to class.

Examinations: There will be two midterm examinations and one final exam. All
examinations will be machine-scored multiple-choice. See course schedule for
dates of midterms and final exam. Each midterm will cover material since
either the beginning of the term or the last midterm as follows.

  * 1st Midterm: Chapters 23-26; lectures through 7/9 
  * 2nd Midterm: Chapters 27-30; lectures through 7/24 
  * Final exam: Chapters 31-34; remaining lectures 

The final exam will also contain a comprehensive component.

No "review" or "study" sheet or guide will be issued in advance of exams.
Examinations will test the student's knowledge and comprehension of all
historical materials contained in lectures and readings. Students are
encouraged to consult "How to Study History" available on the professor's web
home page.

Make-up exams will be given only for medical or other unavoidable emergencies.
No make- up exam will be given later than one week after the regularly
scheduled exam unless for a continuing medical reason. It is the
responsibility of the student to arrange with the professor for a make-up.

Students must take all exams. Those with missing exam scores will receive the
grade of "X" for the course.

Grading: Final letter grades will be computed based on the following:

  * Midterm Exams (2 @ 100 pts) 200 pts 
  * Final Exam 200 pts 

Improvement demonstrated throughout the term will be strongly considered in
determining final letter grade. Grades will also be based on the meaning of
those letters as indicated in the university catalog:

  * A = Exceptional accomplishment 
  * B = Superior 
  * C = Average 
  * D = Inferior 
  * F = Failed 

Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading.

Please understand that high grades are earned, not given. A student's "usual"
grades in other courses have no bearing on his or her grades in this course.

Students are advised that though the professor takes grades very seriously, he
nevertheless considers them to be of little importance compared to learning
and thinking about American history, culture, and civilization.

Office Hours: Office hour times are listed at the top of the first page of
this syllabus. If you cannot meet during posted times, see the professor for
an appointment. Please note that the professor will not answer his office
phone during posted hours so as not to interrupt students who have come for a
conference. If you must phone during those times, please leave a message on
the answering system.

Students are encouraged to make use of the campus e-mail system to communicate
with the professor. Please make sure you enter a clearly-stated subject in the
"subject" line of the message.

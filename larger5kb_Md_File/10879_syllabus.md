###  _VOTES FOR WOMEN:   HISTORY OF A FEMINIST MOVEMENT_

     The subject of woman suffrage has drawn alot of attention lately -- because of historical anniversaries, because of revived   
attention to women in politics.  I trust you will find its history inherently
interesting:  through it we can trace the historical  
activities of women, the complexities and conflicts among women, and the
impact of changing historical forces on women's activism.

     However, because this course is an introduction to historical practice, we will be looking beyond (or within) the particular   
story of woman suffrage to consider the basic elements of thinking and
learning historically, that can be applied to any subject.

     1)  We will learn how to read the work of historians to learn how to understand how they interpret the past.  Each time we read   
a book or set of essays by an historian, our first task will be understand
what the analytic framework, the interpretation that the  
author is generating, to make sense of the historical information s/he has.
All historians, even those who just seem to be "telling  
a story," develop and employ an analytic framework, and we will learn to
clarify what that is.

     2)  At the same time, we will be learning to distinguish between the raw material of history and the way that historians   
shape and give meaning to their data.  For this reason, each week we will read
both secondary (interpretive) historical writing and  
primary (raw material) sources, examine how the interpretations grow out of
the data, and consider some of the different directions  
that we, as budding historians, might take the same primary sources.

     3)  Finally, we will try and make historiographic sense of our readings.   What this means is that we will try and understand each   
of our historians -- and their relations to each other -- in historical
context.   In this way, we will trace the evolution of  
historical interpretation about woman suffrage, starting with Eleanor
Flexner's Century of Struggle, written in 1957, and ending  
with Rosalyn Terborg-Penn's African American Women in the Struggle for the
Vote, published just this year.

**ATTENTION:   NEW FINAL ASSIGNMENT, TO REPLACE THIRD PAPER**  

  * **8 to 10 pages**
  * **due 12/16, 2:30 my office**
  * **use at least three sources, drawing from both primary and secondary readings**

1)  Trace the "historiography" of woman suffrage, that are the different
phases of historical interpretation:  what are the basic assumptions,
questions and answers, who is doing the asking, what isn't being considered,
etc.  In order to use primary sources for this question, consider the History
of Woman Suffrage as the first historical interpretation of the history of
woman suffrage.  And, in order to avoid the "enormous condescension of the
living to the dead," remember that there will be historians that come after
us, that ask questions we can't conceive, so don't imagine that the current
state of historical analysis is the end of the line.

2)  We know that, by the end of the long struggle for woman suffrage, lots of
different sorts of women understood and shared a conviction in the necessity
of political rights for women.  Write an essay examining and comparing some of
the differences among women within this larger pro-suffrage consensus.  You
needn't cover every single type of woman, but make sure that the ones you do
choose to discuss are diverse with respect to class, race and historical
period.

3)  Running as it does across seventy five years (minimally) of American
history, the woman suffrage movement has been transformed by --and had an
impact on -- major changes in American history. Outline a history of the woman
suffrage movement that emphasizes these shifting, large historical contexts:
in particular, antebellum abolition and reform; Reconstruction; turn of the  
century industrialization, immigration and class relations; and the
Progressive period.

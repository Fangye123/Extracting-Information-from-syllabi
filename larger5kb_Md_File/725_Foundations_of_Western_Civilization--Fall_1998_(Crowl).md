###  _Grading_ :

Your final grade in the course will be determined as follows: each test will
count as one-fourth and the final examination will count as one-fourth. The
remaining fourth will consist of the weekly quizzes, map quizzes (each counts
as two regular quizzes), and the mythology quiz (counts as five regular
quizzes). The combined quiz grade will constitute fifteen percent (15%) of the
final grade, and it will be added to the grade for the research paper (five
percent, 5%), and five percent, (5%) for professional development [class
attendance, _promptness in getting to class_ , attentiveness, _classroom
manners_ ], to make up the final quarter of your course grade.

###  _Attendance Policy_ :

Students will find it exceedingly difficult to succeed in this class unless
they attend with regularity. However, your instructor does not believe in
artificially penalizing students by lowering grades for failing to attend
classes. On the other hand, I begin classes promptly and have no patience with
students who are tardy. I therefore reserve the right to _deduct points_ from
the final grade of a student who is regularly late for class. Also I have a
closed mind on absences from tests. Make-ups will be given _only_ when
students can show a valid reason for the absence. In some cases students may
be required to write an additional research paper in addition to taking a
make-up test.

###  _Honor Code_ :

Students are expected to comply with the honor code on all work for the
course.

Return to Table of Contents  


###  _Research Paper_ :

Students are expected to write a research paper of about _five_ (5) pages on a
topic concerning the European world prior to 1648. Topics may come from a wide
variety of subjects, including the history, arts, science, philosophy and
literature of the peoples who made up the Western world to 1648. Students must
confer with the instructor on an individual basis regarding a topic before
September 11.

 At _least five (5)_ sources must be cited in the footnotes or endnotes of the
paper. The paper _must_ be typed on a _word-processor_ or computer. Please be
certain that the ribbon you use is new or nearly so.

Papers with more than ten grammatical errors will be returned with a failing
grade. Please review your paper carefully for such errors before submitting it
for a grade!

Students should learn the proper use of "it's" and "its". Students failing to
use the two properly will be penalized.

Papers are due on _October 6-7_. There will be a _severe_ penalty for papers
handed in after that date, _one letter grade per day!_

"An educated man must have a certain minimum of general knowledge. Even if he
knows little about science and cannot add or substract, he must have heard of
Mendel and Kepler. Even if he is tone deaf he must know something about
Debussy and Verdi; even if he is a pure sociologist he must be aware of Circe
and the Minotaur, of Kant and Montaign, of Titus Oates and Tiberius Gracchus."

###  _Termpaper Requirements_

Students should _NOT_ use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do _NOT_ use parenthetical notes!! _Only_ _footnotes_ and _endnotes_
will be acceptable! Please consult Kate L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers._
6th ed.

Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a termpaper.

Students are permitted to cite only _one_ electronic document.

The following are some useful examples from Turabian:

Footnoting a book:      **1 Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London:
George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33.**

  


If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,      **2 Ibid., 37.** (Note that Ibid. is not underlined)

If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,      **17 Waley, _The Analects_ , 130.**

Footnoting a multi-volume work:      **3 Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ ,
vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in Western Civilization_ , ed. John
W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, l986), 402.**

Footnoting a Review:      **4 Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law
Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in _American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November
l985): 726-29.**

Footnoting a Journal:      **8 Don Swanson, "Dialogue with a Catalogue,"
_Library Quarterly_ 34 (December l963): ll3-25.**

Electronic Documents      **56 Rosabel Flax, _Guidelines for Teaching
Mathematics K-12_ (Topeka: Kansas State Department of Education, 1979)
[database on-line]; available from Dialog, ERIC, ED 178312**

     **57 _Oxford English Dictionary_ , 2d ed., s.v. "glossolalia" [CD-ROM] (Oxford University Press, 1992).**

###  _PLAGIARISM:_

Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in a student
paper without giving proper credit to the author constitutes plagiarism.
Likewise the use of an author's words without placing those words in quotation
marks and providing proper citation is plagiarism. Students sometimes believe
that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in a sentence or
paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism. This is _not_ the case! The
information and ideas taken from a source must be _re-formed into your own
words!_ And after re-forming it into your own words, you must use a footnote
or endnote giving proper credit to the author.

If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
paper will be returned ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to
his office to verify the scholarship.

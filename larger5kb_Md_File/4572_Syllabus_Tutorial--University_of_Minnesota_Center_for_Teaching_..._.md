Introduction  
University-Wide Services  
College or Departmental Services

# Introduction

Find out which relevant services are available to students in your class and
tell students how and why they might make use of these services. Include the
phone number, location, and hours of the service. There are some academic
services available to students on a campus-wide basis which may be helpful to
students in your class. There are also some services available at the college
or department level.

#  University-Wide Services

Two University-wide services which are frequently included in syllabi because
they offer assistance which is relevant to a wide variety of courses are:

> > ###### [The Learning and Academic Skills Center
](http://www.ucs.umn.edu/lasc/)  
>  109 Eddy Hall, East Bank; 624-3323

>>

>> Offers class, workshop, and individual assistance aimed at helping students
achieve academic goals.

>>

>> ######  [The Writing Support Network  
>  ](http://cisw.cla.umn.edu/wsn.html)Combines four major writing centers

>>

>> ###### The Student Writing Center  
>  306 B Lind Hall; 612 625-1893

>>

>> Staffed by TA's and ESL specialists, provides writing help to
undergraduates, adn Macintosh computers for writing and research.

>>

612 626-7579

>>

>> Helps individual faculty, TAs and departments develop writing-intnsive
courses.

Explicitly telling students how the service is relevant to this class and
guiding them in using the service appropriately will increase the likelihood
that students will use the service.

> ### Examples:

>

> ######  Because this class will use multiple choice exams for both the mid-
term and final evaluation, students who feel they have trouble with this kind
of testing might wish to call The Learning and Academic Skills Center (LASC)
and ask what services they have to help students learn to be effective test-
takers.

>

> ######  After you have completed your first draft, you may wish to make an
appointment with a writing lab tutor. Bring a copy of the assignment with you
for the tutor to read as well as your draft. The tutors will offer suggestions
as to how you might revise the paper for better clarity and how to make this
paper better fulfill your purposes and the requirements of the assignment.
Make the appointment early enough to allow yourself time to incorporate the
tutor's suggestions into your final paper.

# College or Departmental Services

You should also include information about services which are offered at the
college or department level. If you are new to the University of Minnesota,
ask your department head or an experienced colleague about tutoring or other
support services available to your students. If your college or department
offers a tutoring service, you may wish to talk with one of the tutors or the
director of the service to learn more about the type of help they provide.
This information will help you create a customized statement about how
students in your class can best use the services offered.

> ### Example:

>

> ###### _WRITING TUTOR_  
>  As a part of the History department's commitment to using intensive writing
to enhance undergraduate education, tutoring services are available for
undergraduates in history courses. Students may visit the tutor at any point
in the writing process - for help getting started with an assignment, feedback
on drafts, etc. The tutor is also willing to help students draft responses to
practice exam questions. This service is available to any student interested
in improving his/her writing skills, at any level of proficiency. For more
information, or to make an appointment, contact:

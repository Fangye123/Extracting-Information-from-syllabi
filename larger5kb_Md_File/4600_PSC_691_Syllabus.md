## Course Description

This course familiarizes students with the fundamental issues and concerns
underlying the practices of inquiry in political science. To this end, we will
discuss various contemporary schools of metatheory (or epistemology, the
theory of knowledge), the prescriptions of which condition those practices.

To ensure comprehension of this material, it will be necessary to develop the
requisite logical vocabulary. For students who have previously undertaken
coursework in symbolic logic, these preliminaries will serve as a refresher.
Although this material will be new for some students, they will not be
disadvantaged. The intent is merely to provide a conceptual background in
logical fundamentals within which to frame our later discussions. I have
selected a (physically) thin book (Phelan and Reynolds, listed below) that
presents this material very informally.

We will also treat the foundations of argumentation, with emphasis upon
developing skills in the presentation, defense of, and critique of scholarly
theses, both written and oral. Topics to be discussed include definition,
categorization, argumentative fallacies, and dialogical disputation. The
intent here is to expose students to the qualities that distinguish sound from
unsound arguments.

## Books

Students are expected to obtain copies of the following books. They have been
ordered through the Orange Bookstore, and copies should be available there.

  * Becker, Howard S. _Writing for Social Scientists_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986. 
  * Kuhn, Thomas S. _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962. 
  * Lakatos, Imre, and Alan Musgrave, eds. _Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970. 
  * Magee, Bryan. _Philosophy and the Real World_. LaSalle, Indiana: Open Court, 1985. 
  * Phelan, Peter and Peter Reynolds. _Argument and Evidence: Critical Analysis for the Social Sciences._ London: Routledge, 1996\. 
  * Putnam, Hilary. _Pragmatisn: An Open Question_. London: Basil Blackwell, 1995. 
  * Rescher, Nicholas. _Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge_. Albany: SUNY Press, 1977\. 
Readings from other sources will be placed on reserve.

The Becker book will not be a focus of our seminar discussions. It is assigned
because students in previous years have found it very useful in overcoming
social and psychological barriers to effective writing. Read it at your
leisure. You will find it enjoyable as well as helpful.

## Course Requirements

Each student will produce a final paper that reviews the intellectual
accomplishments of a faculty member in the Maxwell School. These reviews serve
two purposes. First, they exercise the intellectual constructs discussed over
the course of the semester. Second, they encourage students to familiarize
themselves with the intellectual pursuits of a faculty member, perhaps one
with whom they wish to study.

To expose all students to a range of these intellectual pursuits, and also to
exercise students' skills in oral presentation, each student will present in
class a preliminary report of their final paper. These presentations will
follow a general examination on reading material and seminar discussions.

Students are required to select the faculty member whose work they will review
in advance and with the consent of the instructor. Consent is required in
order to ensure that no two students will review the work of the same faculty
member. Students are encouraged to discuss their reviews in progress with the
faculty members whose works they will review.

## Grading Criteria

Final grades for this course will be assigned on the following basis.

  * Examination (30%). 
  * Final paper (30%). 
  * Presentation (20%). 
  * Participation (20%).

**Syllabus -- Fall, 1999**  
    
    

**Course Description/Objective:** This course presents modern methods of
achieving high quality software, with emphasis on pragmatic issues and use of
examples from real applications. In particular, the course focuses on the
importance of process definition, measurement and continuous improvement as
part of a discipline of quality engineering. Specific metrics and their uses
are discussed along with pitfalls and risks in using metrics.

**Schedule** :     CLASS TIME: WE EVE: 5:30-8:15

                    FIRST DAY OF CLASS: AUG 25

                    LAST CLASS DAY: DEC 1

**Exams** :         MIDTERM (Class #7, 8, or 9); FINAL (Due 1 week after last
class)

Tape and NTU Students have a 3 week max delay in all due dates. ****

**Assignments** : 3 or 4 minor; 1 major: either a quality improvement plan or
a research paper. Each student will prepare either a comprehensive **_quality
improvement plan_** for her or his organization, or else will select a topic
for further research and will prepare a **_research paper_** on his or her
topic. Each student choosing will be encouraged to **_submit a paper for
publication_** based on the plan or research paper. **Grading:** 30% for plan
or paper (assignments 1, 3, and 6); 5% for assignment 2, 15% for assignment 4
(further details in separate handout); 25% for each exam.

**Grading Scale and Expectations:**.A: 93-100; A-: 90-92; B+: 88-89; B: 83-87;
B- 80-82; C+: 78-79; C: 73-77; C- 70-72; and so forth. No curve is used. In
grading, I focus on evidence that the student has **__learned the concepts
taught in the class__** and **__applied them__** to the problem presented in
the examination or assignment. Rote memorization will not help the student as
much as seeking to understand the concepts through study, discussion and
application. I welcome dialog with students on these concept and encourage
discussion of the concepts among students (for example, study groups), so long
as students do not discuss specific details of assignments and examinations.

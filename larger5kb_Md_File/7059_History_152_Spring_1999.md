**HISTORY 152, SPRING 1999  
EXPANSION AND DIVISION  
(U.S., 1789-1877)**

This course will introduce you to the major political, social, economic, and
cultural developments of the United States from George Washington's first
presidency through Reconstruction. We will look at the Federalist and
Jeffersonian eras in an attempt to understand why a political system,
purposefully designed to counter party development, necessarily brought forth
political parties in order to function. We will then look at the market
revolution and the triumph of Jacksonian democracy. We will also study women,
Native Americans, and African Americans, who were left out of the Jacksonian
synthesis. We will conclude with an in-depth examination of the causes of the
Civil War and a brief survey of Reconstruction.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

CLASS DISCUSSIONS:

There will be class discussions of assigned readings as indicated in the
course outline. Your attendance is required, and your participation is
expected and will become part of your final grade. ON CERTAIN DISCUSSION DAYS,
AS NOTED IN THE COURSE OUTLINE, YOU ARE TO TURN INA BRIEF READER-RESPONSE
PAPER (1-3 PAGES) GIVING YOUR REACTIONS TO THE ASSIGNED READINGS. This paper
will be graded for content only and not on style or grammar. Should you fail
to hand in the paper at the beginning of class or should the paper fail to
demonstrate that you have read the material, you will receive a zero (F). The
reader-response papers will count for approximately 15% of your course grade.

EXAMS:

There will be one midterm and one final examination. The midterm will be given
in class on March 8. You are to bring a blue book to the exam. The midterm
will consist of one essay question and some short-answer identification
questions. It will count for about 25% of your grade. The final will cover the
last half of the semester. It will consist of one essay question and some
short-answer identification questions. The class will vote to determine
whether the essay questions will be a take-home essay or a blue-book essay.
The final will count for approximately 30% of your grade. If it shows marked
improvement over your midterm, that will weigh in your favor. Your involvement
in course readings, lectures, and discussions will also contribute to your
grade.

PAPER:

In addition to the reader-response papers, each student will write one 6-8
page essay providing a critical analysis of Frederick Douglass's Narrative.
You will consider how his goals as an antislavery propagandist affected his
depiction of slavery. Unlike reader-response papers, this paper WILL be graded
on style and grammar as well as content. This assignment will be discussed
more fully in class. The paper is DUE ON April 26 and will be returned to you
at the final exam. It will count for approximately 30% of your course grade.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES:

Students with disabilities are to provide their letters of certification and
accommodation within the first two weeks of class. The Disability Services
Office is part of Student Support Services, Main Hall 132. Phone: 262-3065.

PLEASE NOTE:

To pass this course you must turn in ALL assignments. The instructor does not
look kindly on late assignments and, if she accepts them at all, grades them
accordingly. Plagiarism on papers or examinations will be severely punished.
At a minimum, it will result in an F for the course. The definition of
plagiarism is available on the History Department's web page. In addition,
Incompletes (IFs) will not be given unless the instructor has granted prior
approval or a genuine emergency exists. It is your responsibility to contact
the instructor before finals week should you need to take an incomplete and
explain why one is necessary. She may or may not grant one.

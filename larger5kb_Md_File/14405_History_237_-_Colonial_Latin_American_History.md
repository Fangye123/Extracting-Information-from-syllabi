The purpose of this course is to survey the history of

Latin America (Spanish America and Brazil) during the

colonial period of the region.  The colonial period began

with the arrival of the first Europeans in the late

fifteenth century and continued for three centuries until

the start of independence movements about 1808.

**FINAL EXAMINATION: THURSDAY, DECEMBER 12, 11:30 a.m.-2:00 p.m.**

**WRITTEN ASSIGNMENT:** Each student is to write a paper of approximately
1,500 words (excluding notes) in the form of an autobiography by a fictitious
person who might have lived in pre-Columbian or colonial Latin America.
There are many possible subjects: for example, an Aztec or Inca noble, a Maya
priest, a follower of Cort¨¦s or Pizarro, a nun or a priest, an African slave,
a follower of the 18th-c. Indian rebel Tupac Amaru.  At least five sources
(excluding texts) must be used in writing the paper; no more than two of the
sources should be internet sites.  The paper must be documented with notes.
Students should be prepared to indicate their topic to the instructor in
writing no later than October 30. **Papers will be due December 2**.   Any
paper turned in late will be penalized by a reduction in grade.  Under no
circumstances will a paper be accepted, even with a penalty, more than one
week after the deadline.  The paper will account for 30 percent of the final
grade.  Additional instructions will be provided later.

 HY 237, p. 3

**EXAMINATIONS** :  The examinations will consist of objective,

short-answer, and essay questions based on the class

lectures and assigned readings.  The midterm will account

for 30 percent of the final grade, the final examination

for 40 percent.  A student who misses an examination will

be permitted to make it up only if s/he provides written

evidence of compelling circumstances, such as illness of

the student.  A student who misses the mid-term examination

and is permitted to make it up will have to take the exam

at the time regularly scheduled for history makeups:

Saturdays, 9:30 a.m.

**ATTENDANCE:**   Regular attendance is part of the requirements

for this course.  Students may miss up to five classes

without penalty.  Students who miss 6-10 classes,

**_REGARDLESS OF THE REASON_** , will have their grades reduced by

one-third of a letter; 11-15 absences, two-thirds of a

letter; 16-20 absences, full letter; 21 absences or more,

failure of the course.  Students who miss three classes or

less will have their grades raised by one third of a

letter.  It is the responsibility of students who arrive in  

class after the roll has been called to inform the

instructor of their presence.  Students who leave before

the end of the class without informing the instructor

beforehand will be marked absent.  The instructor's records

will be the sole authority in determining student

attendance.

**MISCELLANEOUS:**   Students are requested to refrain from eating during
class.  Telephones should be turned off.

**ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT:** All acts of dishonesty in any work

constitute acts of academic misconduct.  The Academic

Misconduct Disciplinary Policy will be followed in the

event of academic misconduct.

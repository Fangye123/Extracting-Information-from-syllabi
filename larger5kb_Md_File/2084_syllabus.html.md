**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course examines the concept of race--its history and its social
construction--and will trace how its definition has changed over time. We will
focus on race in America, and in so doing, we will interrogate the history of
slavery and the ramifications of slavery for black identity. We will also
consider aspects of black culture, and the complicated ways in which black
culture both acts as a form of resistance to mainstream white society and yet
has been crucial in the shaping of "American" culture. In order to deepen our
understanding of how history is narrated we will visit several public sites:
Mount Vernon, the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museum, and the United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum. At each site we will consider the ways in which a
historical narrative has been constructed and the purposes its public
presentation serves. By paying close attention to exhibition strategies,
architecture and objects displayed, we will gain insight into how a public
site attempts to create meaning and narrate history. These sites will enable
us to think critically about how public history is told, and for whom. We will
analyze the controversies confronted by an exhibit, and seek to locate those
which have been avoided. We will ask why particular sites, out of the many
possibilities, have been developed or preserved. Ultimately we will attempt to
locate the site within a larger historical narrative, enabling us to analyze
how that site attempts to create or revise historical memory. As this class
will be largely discussion, active class participation is required.

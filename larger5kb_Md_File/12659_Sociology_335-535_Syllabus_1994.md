**_Course Objectives:_**   In this class you will learn about the major
demographic processes of fertility, mortality, and migration and the ways in
which these processes are affected by other social and environmental
phenomenon. We will discuss directions in which these processes vary over time
and space to create the size and composition of the world's population. We
will also examine the methods and procedures with which we study population
dynamics (i.e., fertility, mortality, and migration).  
  
**_Texts:_** Population: An Introduction to Concepts and Issues  
(6th edition) by John R. Weeks  
  
**_Attendance and Participation:_** You are expected to prepare by reading
assigned materials and participating informatively in class discussions. If
regular attendance and preparation is a problem, then this class is probably
not for you.  
  
**_Grading and class assignments:**_ You will be graded on the basis of four
exams, several applied exercises and one comprehensive demographic project/
class presentation. The project is a paper and class presentation of a
demographic profile of a country selected from the attached list. Exams
account for 50 percent of the grade; the demographic profile accounts for 30
percent, and your attendance/participation account for 20 percent.  
  
Students taking this course for graduate credit (Sociology 535) will meet with
me at the end of tonight's session regarding requirments for Sociology 535

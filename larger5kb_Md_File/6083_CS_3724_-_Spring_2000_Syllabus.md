Spring 2000 Syllabus  
Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction  
Dr. Hartson

**Course Goals**  
This course presents basic components of human-computer interaction concepts,
theory, and practice.  It takes a user-centered perspective, rather than a
system-centered one.  We look at bridging the gulf between needs and
requirements of human users and capabilities and limitations of technology.
We discuss how to forge communication between users and system developers.  We
base the course on a dichotomy between user interaction design and user
interface software design.  The course covers iterative development of user
interaction design, including user requirements gathering, with emphasis on
usability goals; user analysis; user task analysis; design, rapid prototyping,
and user-centered formative evaluation.  Iterative development activities are
practiced in the context of several team projects.

**Prerequisites**  
Any course in Computer Science or equivalent and junior-level standing, as
evidenced by at least a "3.0" in your academic standing.  This prerequisite is
strictly enforced.  An attempt to get in this course without the prerequisite
constitutes an Honor Code violation.

**Text**  
No required textbook is used.  Class materials will be drawn from multiple
sources, with heavy reliance on class notes. Class notes will be available
from a local copy center and will also be posted on the course web site (see
the [calendar](calendar.html)).

**Class Notes**  
Class notes will be put on the Web in advance of the class in which they will
be covered by way of quizzes, discussions, and activities.  You can access
each set of class notes via the [calendar](calendar.html). It is mandatory
that you bring these notes with you to every class.

**Homework**  
There will be several written homework assignments.  Each assignment will both
be posted on the Web and announced in class well in advance of its due date.
Assignments will not be "handed out" (as in a paper version).

**Quizzes**  
You control your own reading pace. Therefore you must decide how far ahead to
read in order to prepare for what we will reasonably be able to cover in one
class. Frequent quizzes, often unannounced, will be used to evaluate the
reading assignments. See "Class Policies" section below regarding missed
quizzes. There is no midterm in this course so you should treat the quizzes as
a cumulative midterm.

**In-class activities**  
This course is undergoing a paradigm shift from lecture-based delivery to an
active learing approach. This means eliminating the usual classroom lectures
using overheads which, in the past, students have found boring and monotonous.

Instead, you will read the material in the class notes on your own and class
time will be used to supplement the reading. The objectives:

  * it will be more interesting
  * you will learn more

This new approach means that you, the student, will have more responsibility
for your learning in two ways. In particular, you will have to:

  * read enough of the class notes to be prepared for what we cover in each class
  * understand the material and be ready to discuss and put it into practice.

We will use in-class dicussion and group or individual activities in class to
apply the material to problem situations. Since your performance in these in-
class activities will be graded, you have to always be ready to be called on
in class.

See "Class Policies" section below regarding missed in-class activities.
**_You must bring your class notes to each class_** ; we will use them to
coordinate these activities.

**Team project**  
The class is divided into teams of three members each, on a arbitrary basis.
No swapping of team members is allowed.  The team is given a grade for each
part of the project.  Each individual team member's grade for each project
assignment is a weighting of the team grade, where the weighting is based on
an evaluation of individual contributions, collected from each team member at
the end of the semester.

**Final Exam**  
The final exam is in-class, closed book, closed notes, and cumulative (See
[Calendar](calendar.html) for date and time).

**Class Policies**

    
_Attendance and making up graded activities_

> Occasionally you might need to be absent from class for a good reason, and
it might cause you to miss a quiz and/or an in-class activity. Attendance is
not required for the course, nor does it play a direct part in the course
grade. However, if you are absent for a quiz, or if your turn comes up for an
in-class activity when you are absent, you will get a grade of zero for that
quiz or activity.

> One might normally expect to be able to make up a quiz or activity missed
due to an excused absence (i.e., an absence for a legitimate reason such as
illness). However, the large number of quizzes and in-class activities would
entail a unreasonably large amount of time and effort spent on negotiating
excuses and administering and grading make-up assignments. **_Therefore, the
policy for this class must be:   No make-ups for missed quizzes or in-class
activities. _**As an alternative, when final grades are computed for the
course, I will drop the lowest quiz grade and the lowest in-class activity
grade. If more compensation is appropriate, I will consider dropping more
grades. Also, the course grades will be curved, so your missed classes will
probably average out with those of the other students. Thus, if your absences
are infrequent, it shouldn't have a significant effect on your course grade.

> If you have to miss class for an extended period due to a protracted illness
or similar reason, we will treat your needs as a special case and I will do
everything I can to help you recover lost ground

_Reading assignments_

> You are responsible for keeping up with the reading of class notes per the
schedule given in the course [calendar](calendar.html).

>

> You are also responsible for knowing where our class discussion are, with
respect to the class notes, and setting your own reading pace to keep ahead
enough to be prepared for class discussions and activities. There will be
numerous quizzes, often unannounced, to assess how well you are keeping up.

_Homework and project assignments_

> All homework and project assignments must be turned in at the beginning of
class on the due date.  All due dates for assignments are firm.  Any
assignment that you do not hand in on time will be given a grade of zero. If
you are not able to complete an assignment by the due date, you should hand in
as much of it as you have done.  You must prepare your assignments
electronically and hand in a hardcopy by the due date/time.  Assignments may
not be submitted via email to either the professor or a GTA.

_Weather delays_

> If the university is closed on an assignment due date, it will be due (in a
box or pile outside Dr. Hartson's door) by 2 p.m. on the first day the
university reopens.

_Questions about grading_

> While the professors establish grading standards and work with the GTA in
grading, the GTA has the responsibility to grade homework and project
assignments. Therefore, when you have questions about grading of these, you
should first see the GTA who graded the work.  All questions regarding grading
must be resolved within one week of return of the graded work.  **Keep all
graded work until the end of the semester.**   In case your grade is
incorrectly recorded, you will need to bring in the graded original in order
for the recorded grade to be changed.

_Responding to e-mail_

> The professor and GTA will make every effort to answer your email to them in
a timely fashion.  However, due to the volume of email with classes of this
size, you should not expect to get a reply in less than 24 hours.  Many times
you may get a reply in less than 24 hours, but you should not count on it
(e.g., to answer questions about a homework or project assignment within the
last few hours before that assignment is due).  Please put "CS3724" as the
subject line of your email; that will help us identify your emails more
quickly.

_No "extra credit" work_

> Students sometimes ask for some extra credit work near the end of the
semester in an attempt to bring up poor grades.  No extra credit work will be
given to any student on an individual basis. However, occasionally an extra-
credit opportunity might be offered to the whole class.

_Leaving class early_

> You are expected to remain through the entire class period, as leaving early
is disruptive and disturbs everyone else in the classroom.  If you know in
advance that you must leave early, you are to clear it with the professor
before class begins, and then to sit as near the door as possible and leave
quietly. "I'm sleepy" is not a valid excuse for leaving early :>)

_Grades via e-mail_

> Because of the large number of students in each class, professors and GTAs
will not be able to reply to individual email requests for final exam and/or
class grades at the end of the semester, but grades will be posted (on the Web
and otherwise).

**Honor System**  
The current Honor System policies of the University are to be observed in this
course.  All individual work (e.g., homework, exams) must be completed by you,
working alone.  The group project should be carried out without assistance
from people outside the group, except as explicitly noted in an assignment.

**Special Needs**  
If you have any special needs because of disabilities, please contact your
professor during the first week of classes.

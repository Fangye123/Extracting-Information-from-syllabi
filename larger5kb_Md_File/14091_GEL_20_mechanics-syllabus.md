**Sorry gang, I wasn't able to get a spreadsheet with your grades up on this
website. The grades are posted outside my door (Rm 386 Physics/Geology) so
feel free to stop by and have a look.**

**Geology 20:** This course focuses on the geologic history of California, the
origin of mountain ranges, basins and other landforms, the development of
economic resources (including water), and developing a deeper appreciation of
California landscapes. GE credit: Wrt.  
  
**Textbook** : _California Geology_ (1998) by Deborah Harden.  
In my opinion, all textbooks are inherently unreadable. This book is no
different. But reading this text _selectively_ to enhance your understanding
of topics discussed in lecture will almost certainly improve your final grade.
The textbook is well written and is very useful for the figures that it
contains. You will find it a very important supplement to the lecture material
in the class.

**Outlines of notes** for individual topics/lectures will be posted on the
class website as far in advance of each class as possible. These are **not**
comprehensive and should be used only as an outline \- **_they are not a
substitute for coming to class._**  
Print the note outlines off to use as a guide during class, annotate them with
details from the lectures, and study them for exams. The notes need to be
supplemented by selectively reading the relevant pages in the book.  They are
available at [GEL 20 notes.](gel20notes)

**Class Structure:** Geology is perhaps the most visual of sciences. It is
much more exciting and fun to **see** features of California geology than it
is to **read** about them. So in the absence of fieldtrips (a bit unwieldy
with  >200 people), you'll see lots and lots of images, a few video clips and
a few Quicktime movies.  

_I strongly encourage you to speak up in class - any question is legitimate
and I'll take the time to answer it._

_Come to class_ \-  You'll spend much less time during the hour you spend
listening to me and watching slides than you will trying to teach the material
to yourself from notes and the book. In my experience over 9 years of college
instruction, the students who come to class invariably get the best grades.
This class should not be difficult - With just a moderate amount of time,
energy, and concentration, you can earn an A or B and propel yourself on to
fame, fortune, and a six-figure income.



**Term Paper:** You receive a writing credit for this class. Specific
instructions for writing the term paper can be found at
[GEL20TermPaper](GEL20TermPaper.Html). Length is 4-6 pages and counts for 30%
of your class grade.  
\- We'll devote half of a class period early in the quarter to a discussion of
what is expected for the term paper.

\- Writing a good term paper acts as an extra exam toward your grade - useful
points if you don't do well on one of the exams.

\- You are welcome to talk to me about your paper whenever you wish. Visit me
in my office and I'll guide you through the process and read whatever you like
to help you stay on track.  
\- Among several topics that you can choose from is the "Geology of Your
Hometown" . . .

_Term Paper due the next-to-last day of class, March 12._  
  

**Grading** :

**Midterm** (Tuesday, Feb. 5) = 30%  
**Final** (Saturday, March 23, 8:00-10:00) = 40%  
**Term Paper** (Tuesday, March 12) = 30%  
  
Exams will be all multiple choice - be forewarned, I can make a nasty multiple
choice exam that will make you think, not just spew memorized notes.

\- I don't give extra credit assignments.

\- NO EARLY EXAMS OR MAKEUP EXAMS.

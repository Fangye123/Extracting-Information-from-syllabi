_Part 1: The Age of Nationalism_

**_Honors Seminar_**

**_**Note: This syllabus is still under construction. It may be altered._**

History 133  
Swarthmore College  
Prof. Bruce Dorsey  
Fall 1999

This seminar will explore major themes and topics in the political and
diplomatic history of the United States from the American Revolution to the
Philippine-American War ending in 1902. One might say the narrative we're
exploring this semester concentrates on how a nation emerged out of the grips
of one empire only to become an empire itself. The meanings of nationalism in
American life, the historical impulses toward empire, and the social and
political conflicts that defined nineteenth-century American life and culture
will be central themes in this course.

### REQUIRED READINGS:

  * Thomas G. Patterson, _American Foreign Relations: A History_ , v. 1 To 1920.
  * Thomas G. Patterson, _Major Problems in American Foreign Relations_ , v. 1.
  * Gordon S. Wood, _The Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787_.
  * David Waldstreicher, _In the Midst of Perpetual Fetes._
  * Thomas R. Hietala, _Manifest Design_.
  * Tyler G. Anbinder, _Nativism &.Slavery_.
  * Jean H. Baker, _Affairs of Party The Political Culture of Northern Democrats_.
  * Eric Foner, _A Short History of Reconstruction_.
  * Robert McMath, _American Populism_.
  * Rebecca B. Edwards, _Angels in the Machinery_.
  * Walter LaFeber, _New Empire An Interpretation of American Expansion, 1860-1898_.

### COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

It goes without saying that every student in the seminar will attend and
participate actively in the seminar (Oh, sorry, but I just said that.)

_Reading Assignments_ :

Students are expected to purchase and read the required readings for each
week, complete the minimum reading assignment, and in most cases read all (or
nearly all) of the additional reading. Students will also be expected to
become acquainted with the material for each week's topics for seminar papers.
If we are not prepared to discuss these topics, then additional written
assignments will have to be added to the seminar requirements.

_Written Assignments_ :

You will write at least _four_ papers for this seminar. Papers should be about
4-5 (single spaced) pages (1,200-2,000 words) in length. The quality of your
work, not the size of your paper, is our primary concern. A list of topics and
readings is included within each week of the syllabus.

Seminar papers should be able to critically analyze the arguments of
historians, and concisely and convincingly present your own assessment of an
important theme or topic in American political or diplomatic history. A good
seminar paper will bring the other members of the seminar immediately into the
heart of your argument, without excessive narrative or description. It will
also present the most convincing evidence you can find to substantiate your
interpretation. Seminar papers must include a bibliography of sources used.

Seminar papers are due on the class server no later than 24 hours before the
seminar meets. Every member of the seminar will be responsible for reading
each other's papers carefully prior to the seminar and offering comments on
the papers as a part of the seminar session.

_Discussion Leadership_ :

At least one student each week will be responsible for being the seminar
discussion leader. The discussion leader will be responsible for having read
book reviews of the major readings for each seminar paper, and for preparing
discussion questions that both facilitate discussion for the seminar and also
ask the authors of papers to relate their conclusions to the general readings
that week. A good discussion leader will try to keep the discussion focused on
a particular historical problem, and will be often asked to summarize the
seminar discussion at the end of the class.

_Examination_ :

All students will take a final examination. Final exam date & time:

GEO 307, The History of Anglo-American Cartography

[Return to the list of courses  
---|---  
Course Description  |  The study of cartography -- a complex practice which
links technology, science, art, and literature -- provides an alternative
approach to cultural and social history with its focus on the creation,
dissemination, and control of spatial knowledge. It encourages questions such
as, which social institutions (broadly construed promoted the creation and use
of maps? What cultural expectations defined the character of geographic
knowledge? Conversely, how have those social institutions and cultural
expectations been shaped by the practices of map-making? These issues will be
explored in an analysis of the similarities and differences of map-making in
Britain and North America, from ca.1500 to 1917. Particular attention will be
paid to the territorial aspects of the modern state, to the economic
foundations of map-making, and to the cultural ideology of geographical
knowledge.  
Validity of this Document  |  This document is not a valid contract with
students currently enrolled in this course. It is offered here for
informational purposes only. In each semester, the precise syllabus, readings,
and manner of assessment will vary. Students must refer to the **printed**
syllabus handed out at the start of the semester. Even then, I reserve the
right to change the _printed_ syllabus as necessary.  
Required Readings  |  There are no texts required for this course.

The essay readings associated with each course topic are listed in the
_printed_ syllabus and are available in a course anthology. Most come from
journals and books which can also be consulted in the Osher Map Library or the
regular stacks of the USM libraries.

For the week prior to each class (starting saturday morning), particularly
relevant maps and 'thought-provoking questions' are available for examination
by students in the Osher Map Library. These are not compulsory, but will help
the student's comprehension of the course.  
Office Hours and Communication  |  Please refer to the section of my homepage
on [how to contact me](whereiam.html) for current office hours, addresses,
etc.  
Academic Integrity  |  Students are expected to make themselves familiar with
USM's Student Academic Integrity Policy. Copies of the policy may be obtained
through the Office of Student Judicial Affairs, 125 Upton Hall (tel.
780-5242). If you are in **any** doubt regarding the requirements -- or if you
do not understand the meaning of plagiarism, cheating, fabrication, or other
academic misconduct -- _please_ consult with me before you begin any projects
or examinations required for the course. Failure to abide by the established
policy will result in the award of zero points for the exam or project; if the
failure is conscious, then I will award an F for the entire course. Any
penalties will be made in accordance with USM policies.

A special component of academic integrity that pertains to this course is
proper behavior in special libraries. To complete the papers, most students
will use the collections of the Osher Map Library and Smith Center for
Cartographic Education; some students might also use the library of the State
Historical Society or another special library. Such libraries are governed by
strict codes of conduct necessary to preserve their historic and rare
materials. A copy of the regulations for the map library is attached. You must
obey any directions of the library staff and you must follow the _spirit_ of
their specific regulations. Following the letter of the regulations is
insufficient. That is, you must respect the materials which you consult. Under
no circumstances should you deface or damage them, either directly or
indirectly through negligence; you must treat all materials with great care.
Failure to do so will result in the award of an F for the course.  
Citations and the Referencing of Sources  |  On an issue closely related to
academic integrity, students are expected to be competent in the
identification and citation of sources. Citations will be in note form. Please
refer to the [brief style guide](citationstyle.html), although this is not
comprehensive. The adequacy and quality of references and citations in each
paper will contribute to grades. Again, if you have questions, please ask!  
Paper Presentation  |  As befits a course which is intimately concerned with
aesthetics, submitted papers will adhere to a high quality of presentation
design. The wide availability of word processors means that there is no excuse
for the submission of poorly laid-out or incorrectly spelled documents. All
papers will meet [specific physical requirements](paperformat.html).  
Assessment  |  Assessment is through two papers (30% and 40% respectively) and
a take-home final (30%). Because they are essential components of any essay,
the papers will be evaluated according to their presentation, grammar,
spelling, and syntax in addition to content. The exam will be (short) essay
questions. Because of its nature, the exam may be hand-written and will not be
judged for grammar, etc., in as strict a manner as the papers.

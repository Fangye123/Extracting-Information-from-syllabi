_**Course description**_  
This course is intended to provide teachers and other educators with current
information about learning disabilities that is relevant to their daily
practice.   In this era of inclusion, all educators can expect to work with
students who have learning disabilities.  Topics addressed will include
theories and knowledge about the origins and nature of learning disabilities,
development across the lifespan, characteristics of individuals with learning
disabilities, and approaches to service delivery and teaching.  
Participants in this course will learn how to apply the information to improve
their service to students with learning disabilities that range from mild to
severe.  
  
  
_**Assignments**_  
Those students with documented disabilities who have special learning needs
are invited to inform the instructor, so that special arrangements can be
made.   They should also be aware that assistance is available from the
Academic Development Center (200 O'Neill Library).  
  
**Readings**  
There will be a short reading assignment for all participants for each class.
A coursepack (a bound collection of the readings) is available in the BC
Bookstore, McElroy Commons.  
  
All reading assignments should be completed in advance of the class meeting
for which they are assigned.  
  
To divide-and-conquer additional reading, participants will select reading
teams on the second night of class, based on their interests.  Teams will be
responsible for reporting on their readings to the whole class (see below).  
  
**Class participation**  
Attendance and active participation is expected.   Your classmates will be
depending on you to share your expertise from your work in the schools,
related coursework, assigned readings and personal experiences.  
  
**Reading Team Presentations**  
Reading teams will be assigned based on individual 's areas of interest.  Each
team will be responsible for making a presentation to the class that (a)
provides a synopsis of readings they select and (b) enables the rest of the
class to relate their interests to that of the team (e.g., by discussion or
example activities).  Handouts are optional.  Presentation plans will be
discussed with the instructor in advance.  Guidelines for the team
presentation will be shared at the July 6 class.  
Perspective paper:  
Due by July 27, a short paper will be written that presents major perspectives
on one of the course topics.  The author will take a position and support that
position with information from class, readings and personal experience.
Information that would support alternative positions must also be presented
and discussed.  The topic may be the same as your reading team topic.
Guidelines for the perspective paper will be shared at the July 6 class.
Suggested length: 5-7 pages plus references  
  
**Personal Reflection Paper**  
Due August 3.   To help participants relate what they learn to their own
practice as students and/or educators, a journal-style reflection paper will
be written.  The author will reflect on how her/his (a) knowledge and
perspective on learning disabilities has evolved due to course participation
and (b) work/studies should be impacted by information learned.  The
reflection paper will end with an action plan for how the participant will
incorporate information from the class in her/his work or study.  Suggested
length: 1-3 pages, plus 1 page plan of action in narrative outline style

In fairness to your classmates who complete their papers on time, five points
will be deducted from the total score per each day a paper is late, unless the
instructor has granted permission to be late prior to the day the paper is
due.  
Students who do not complete all assignments will receive a letter grade of
"F" or an incomplete at the instructor's discretion.

Instruction**  
**Program Themes**  

  
Programs in the Teacher Education, Special Education, and Curriculum  &
Instruction Department have five unifying themes.  In this course we address
the five themes in the following ways:  
  
**Promoting social justice:**   We will critically examine when and how the
concept of "learning disabilities" contributes to and denies equality of
social opportunity.  Further, we will investigate the practices of education
and social services, as well as cultural practices, that impact social
justice.  
**  
Constructing knowledge:**   Much of this course is about the enduring
questions that surround the concept of learning disabilities and practices in
identifying and serving persons with learning disabilities.  The student will
necessarily bring her/his own perspective to bear in understanding the content
we study.  In the same regard, the class will function as a community of
learners, where we share and construct our knowledge together.  
**  
Inquiring into practice:**   Understanding of this class's topic will require
self-investigation of our own assumptions and practices related to persons
with learning disabilities.  We will use the final sections of the class to
overtly practice incorporating what we are learning into our routines.  
  
**Accommodating diversity:**   In addition to respecting diversity among
ourselves in the class, participants will be expected to critically reflect
upon how they can accommodate the unique needs of all individuals in
education, with appropriate consideration for any unique needs of individuals
based on learning disabilities.  
  
**Collaborating with others:**   The class will be strongly focused on
understanding how collaborations among general and special educators, related
service providers, administrators, community agencies, families, students, and
the community are essential to providing effective education.

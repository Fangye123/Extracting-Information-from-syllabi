Course Description
This course is organized around reading about and discussing the theme
of history, memory and popular culture in the post-Civil War South. The
goal of the course is to explore the ways in which various groups of southerners
have crafted collective representations of their pasts. During the semester
students will critically analyze representations of the past in civic celebrations,
literature, historic preservation sites, tourist destinations, and popular
culture. The role of ideology, class, gender, and race in shaping collective
memory will be emphasized. Classes will operate in a discussion format,
with brief lectures/comments introducing the various weekly themes. In
addition to completing a research essay, each student will prepare assigned
readings for discussion, participate in class discussion and deliver one
class presentation (15 minute) and write one short essay on the topic of
his/her presentation (7-9 pages). The short essay will critically review
a major work of scholarship on historical memory. In addition, each student
will write a critique of the existing web site (4-5 pages) as well as a
critical analysis of the site the class will visit on its field trip (4-5
pages). Each student also will write a substantial research essay (15-20
pages) which will contribute indirectly to the entire class' "virtual museum"
site. The second, longer essay will assess critically a topic related broadly
to race relations and the civil rights movement in Gainesville and/or Florida,
the desegregation of the University of Florida, or contemporary race relations
on campus. The larger research essay will be chosen by the student but
approved by Prof. Brundage. 

The centerpiece of the class will be continuing construction of a "virtual
museum" on the Internet that focuses on the desegregation of the University
of Florida. The creation of the "museum site" will enable the class to
participate in all of the decisions involved in selecting what out of the
past will be remembered and how it will be presented. Thus, the class will
study the operation of historical memory in the abstract while simultaneously
engaging in the practical crafting of historical memory.

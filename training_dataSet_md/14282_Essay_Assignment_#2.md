Choose one of the following books and write a five-seven page review of it.
Begin with a citation of all the publication information for your book in the
MLA format.  The review should give a thorough summary of the contents of the
book and a discussion of its value.  When considering the value, you need to
take into account the book's intended or supposed audience, the purpose of the
book, the quality of the author's thinking and writing, and the time when it
was written.  Develop your assessment based on your experience of reading the
book as compared to any idea you may have in mind of an ideal book on the same
subject for the same audience.

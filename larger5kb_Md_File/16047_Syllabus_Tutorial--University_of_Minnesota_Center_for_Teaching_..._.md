# Introduction

The minimum course description required in the syllabus is one which
corresponds to the course guide. Embellish and personalize this description
and tell students the general topics you emphasize in the course.

This is an excellent opportunity to share your enthusiasm for the subject
matter and answer the question: "Why would a student want to take this
course?"

> ### Example:

>

> ###### Welcome to Political Science 1001. This course is designed as a broad
survey of American national government and politics. As you know, this is an
exciting time in American politics. The balance between the two major parties
has shifted, Republicans have established a new policy agenda for the federal
government, and many of the responsibilities of government are shifting to
state governments. This is a great time to be studying American national
politics.

Government and Politics**

> ######  Welcome to Shakespeare! I hope you will find this class interesting,
exciting, and valuable. Our primary goal over the next ten weeks is to read
carefully, understand, and appreciate some of Shakespeare's sonnets and five
of his plays. I hope that together we can discover things in this four hundred
year old works that have value and relevance to our lives today.

> **Christine Mack Gordon, English 3241: Shakespeare: Sonnets and Early
Plays**

You may also want to share something about your approach to the subject
matter, especially if your approach differs from what might be considered
standard. For example, when English Professor Toni McNaron teaches Milton, she
always includes this statement, "I teach Milton from a feminist perspective."
This statement allows students who wish a more traditional approach to Milton
to elect to take the course from another instructor.

This section of the syllabus also allows you to discuss your use of technology
in the classroom. Be clear about how technology is used in the course.

> ### Example:

>

> ######  **WORK WITH COMPUTERS**

>

> ###### You have registered for an interactive, computer supported class. You
must take responsibility for interacting with your classmates and me and for
willingly using computers. I will help you use computer to interact with the
class and to help you write. Computers are meant for helping you. Consider
them as part of your writing team. They will support your writing process. I
will help you to use computers so they are helpful rather than a painful
experience. As part of the writing team, computers will help you research,
organize your writing, spell correctly, design your document, and communicate
with others. I will teach you how to use computers to help you and to minimize
technical problems. Like typical team members, computers are not perfect.
Communicating with them requires learning how they communicate with you. They
usually help you, but occasionally they do something unexpected. In general,
if you work well with your computer, your computer will work well with you.

After you have written the description of your course, ask a friend or
colleague to read it and respond to these questions:

  * Would you want to take this course? Why or why not? 
  * Based on my course description, how would you describe my attitude toward this subject?

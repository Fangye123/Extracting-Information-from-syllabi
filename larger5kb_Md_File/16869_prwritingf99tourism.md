Note:  These chapter notes and study questions should not be viewed as
substitutes for coming to class and joining in the lecture and discussion.
Rather, they should be viewed as a starting point for lecture and discussion.
These notes will be heavily supplemented with discussion, examples and debate
in class.  To do well in class, you should read the text and make some notes
on the reading, read these on-line notes and study questions, come to class,
make your own notes and be ready to discuss what you have read and studied
intelligently. _\--Dr. John M. King_

**Newsom Ch. 2 Notes/Questions**

**Ethical and Legal Responsibilities of the PR Writer**  
**Sept. 8, 1999**

The authors list several examples of PR practice with questionable ethics.
See pages 18 and 19.

Why should we care about ethics as long as we are performing our jobs as PR
writers legally?

Newsom says PR writers should be sensitive to others feelings and that they
should practice the golden rule.  
He also says some PR writing practices are set by laws, others by moral
principles, a sense of what is right and wrong.  
And, he says that public opinion is formed by the public's perception of
whether an organization exhibits a sense of rightness in its beliefs and
actions.

**Circles of Influence** See page 21.

**Dynamics**  
The circle of influence model is static.  The relationship between PR writers
and an organization, laws, ethics and society's expectations are all in flux.

**Values**  
normative ethics- used by theologians and philosophers; relatively stable  
comparative ethics- studied by social scientists; these vary across cultures
and time

**Influence of Personal Standards**  
Personal Standards often clash with others within an organization.

Four options you can take as a PR writer when given a task that clashes with
your personal standards.

1/ educate/persuade others to agree with your standards

2/ refuse to do the task

3/ ask to be assigned another task

4/ take the assignment (clenching your teeth and muttering under your breath)

5/ I've added this one.  Look at the task closely, examine your own personal
standards, listen to arguments from the other side and then decide what action
to take.  


**Study Questions 1:   Suppose you are an avid environmentalist working for a
company that has built some of its reputation as an environmentally conscious
corporate citizen, and you have been assigned to produce a brochure for a
company program that you know will likely result in immediate environmental
destruction.  What arguments could you put forth that would effectively allow
you to refuse the task and educate others to agree with your standards?  What
would happen if you took the assignment? What dangers are there for the
organization and for you if you simply give in and take the assignment?**  


**Influence of Organization and Industry Standards**

Perceptions  
Some organizations place top priority on the public interest or the good of
their many publics.  
Others are seen as greedy monoliths with little regard for the public welfare.

Organizations must respond quickly, responsively and honestly to crisis
situations.

Public opinion or perception about organizations are formed by organizational
performance; these opinions are enduring.  
examples:  Tylenol cyanide poisoning, EXXON oil spill, TEXACO racial boycotts,
racial discrimination at Denny's restaurants

**Organization Culture and Values**  
New employees are indoctrinated into the organizational culture from day one
through formal training (orientation programs), telling of corporate history
stories (Bill refused to take on an account with a major polluter; he was
fired the next day), and observation and listening to day-to-day interactions
among fellow employees (learning the ropes).

**Automatic Responses**  
It is easy to become an automaton, yes woman or yes man.  (Have you see The
Stepford Wives movie?)

Responsible PR writers should be critical thinkers who contribute to the
organization.

PR writers must be sensitive to the needs of the various publics the
organization interacts with.

Pr writers need to make sure that editing and other changes do not
substantially alter the messages that are communicated.

**Influence of Public Relations Standards of Practice**  
Professional standards stand apart from industry standards and organizational
standards.

see the **[PRSA code of Ethics](http://www.prsa.org/profstd.html)**

**Accuracy**  
If accuracy suffers credibility suffers.  Even honest mistakes can hurt
credibility.

**Honesty, Truth and Fairness-**  
The key here is balance.  Potentially damaging information must be
acknowledged if it is true.

**False of Misleading Information**  
Deceptions rarely last very long.  Damage from them is long-lasting.

How you select facts and weave them into the writing can be perceived as
misleading.

Some college basketball programs have a habit of saying that they have a 100
percent graduation rate.  What they really mean is that among all the players
who didn't drop out or fail out before the end of their senior year, they all
graduated.  This is like saying that 100 percent of the graduates graduated.
This hardly the impression most of the public would have about a 100 percent
graduation claim.

You can be sure that when the basis for the claim is disclosed by a newspaper
or TV reporter or an NCAA investigation, the damage to credibility will be
long lasting.

Manville, which misled the public about the dangers of asbestos and the major
tobacco companies, which misled the public about the addictiveness of nicotine
have paid dearly for their mistakes--billions of dollars.

The government agencies involved in the Waco incident have created a multitude
of problems for themselves by not disclosing information about the nature of
smoke bombs used during the raid on the Branch Dividian compound.  


Such violations of the PRSA code result in a loss of credibility for the
entire profession.  Journalists who engage in similar practices have resulted
in members of that profession being rated below used car sales people on
public credibility scales.

**Study Questions 2:   It's your first day on the job at Big Bucks PR Agency
in Atlanta and you discover the national account you have been assigned has
deceived the public about a public health issue for 10 years.  In fact, for 10
years the company, which makes 1,000 products, has been selling and promoting
a diaper lotion that causes cancer in children.  Using the ethics guides
above, what would you do?  How could you help the company go public with this
news and salvage its otherwise good reputation?**

**Note:   We will cover the laws and regulations section during the next
class.**

**Influence of Laws and Regulations**

**Negative Laws**  
Laws are generally negative  
-generally define what is not legal rather than what is legal

However, state and federal regulatory agencies often approach law from the
other direction, deciding what is legal.

Case Law  
Case law is built upon a series of decisions in state and federal courts.
Courts in one state may or may not base their decisions on laws established in
other states.  Often cases are decided this way, but sometimes they are not.
Case law is based on precedents sometimes, but in communications law
precedents are sometimes ignored, sometimes extended and changed slightly.
Other times, case law is changed significantly.  Federal courts often accept
rulings in other federal districts, but sometimes they do not.

Constitutional Law  
United States Supreme Court decisions, of course, in and of themselves, are
final.  But even these decisions get changed over time through other cases
heard before the United States Supreme Court.  Libel and privacy laws are good
examples of this process.  Both areas of communications law have had
substantial revision in the United States Supreme Court in this century.

Check out these sites for more background on communications law:

**[Oyez Oyez Oyez](http://oyez.nwu.edu/index.html)**   An excellent site that
allows you to search and find almost all United States Supreme Court Cases,
including full audio of the actual arguments made to the court on many cases.

**[mclawsu98](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/9279/mclawsu98.htm)**   A media
law syllabus for a course in media law I taught at LSU.  This one has lots of
notes and links.

**[FindLaw: Supreme Court
Opinions](http://www.findlaw.com/casecode/supreme.html)** Another excellent
site that allows you to search for cases.

**[The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press](http://www.rcfp.org/)**
A very useful site that covers numerous areas of communications law.

**[RCFP First Amendment Handbook](http://www.rcfp.org/handbook/viewpage.cgi)
A** n excellent source for an overview of almost every communications law
topic of importance, including libel, privacy, access to courts, gag orders,
cameras in courtrooms, hidden recording, rights of access, FOI acts,
confidential sources of information, newsroom searches, prior restraints,
obscenity and copyright.  


**Contracts**  
"For Hire" contracts  
Unless a vendor (photographer, artist, writer, etc.) gives you complete
ownership of creative work in a legal written contract, it is assumed that the
creator of the work retains ownership of the creative work.  So, if you hire a
photographer, pay her $5,000 for 10 photos you want to use in your company
brochure and then decide later than you'd like to use the same photos on a web
site, you will have to get permission to use the images and pay additional
fees to the photographer.

In-house artists, photographers, writers, etc. who are employees of the
organization often sign contracts that allow the organization to retain
ownership of the work and use it without procuring permission or paying
additional fees.  But, if the organization does not have a written contract to
that effect, it cannot legally use creative works in such ways.

Photo releases must be obtained from people whose likenesses appear in
corporate publications, brochures, etc.  Newsletters, PSAs, editorial
advertisements (used to advance a political stance, for example) and other
informational materials MAY be deemed to be fair use publications, like a
newspaper.  When in doubt, get a release.  Most employees within an
organization sign a release upon being hired so that PR folks don't have to
get a release every time someone's photo appears in a company newsletter.

Music used in video news releases,  PSA's, in ads, on web sites, in slide
shows, in or many other venues must be covered with permission, most often
accomplished by setting up an umbrella contract with **[ASCAP (American
Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers)](http://www.ascap.com/ascap.html).  Also, see [licensing info from
ASCAP.](http://www.ascap.com/licensing/licensing.html)**  


Insider information  
Most employees are required to maintain confidentiality about company or
organizational matters.

Using insider information on financial matters may land you in jail.  If you
use insider information for personal gain or if you give such information to
others for personal gain, you amy be charged with insider trading and be in
very hot water with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  This is
especially important for PR writers who prepare press releases on financial
matters in advance.

Libel and Privacy  
Libel is published information that defames (damages the reputation or
otherwise causes harm) to an individual or in some cases an organization.

Public figures must prove that the 1/ publication took place, 2/ that he or
she was the subject of the defamation 3/ that damages were the result and that
the defamation was done with actual malice (with knowing and reckless
disregard for the truth).

Private figures must prove the first three tests but do not have to prove
actual malice.  They ONLY have to show negligence.  So, if you publish an
editorial in the corporate newsletter or in the corporate magazine blasting a
competitor and use "red flag" words (see page 33 in Newsom) and accidentally
put a photo of the wrong person in the article, the person in the photo may be
able to sue as well as the object of the attack in the first place.

Truth is still a defense in libel cases, but it is virtually impossible to use
in negligence cases.

Libel cases are expensive to defend.  Average awards in cases in which
communicators lose are well over $1 million and the costs even in cases in
which communicators win can be hundreds of thousands of dollars as well.

Privacy cases

Appropriation laws-must have permission to use images in commercial context.
Companies can't take news images and use them in ads for example, unless they
represent fair comment.  This comes up a lot in political communication.

Truth is not a defense in privacy cases.  People can sue on the grounds that
the publication brought to the public private facts that were embarrassing.
An AIDs brochure that features photos of patients at an AIDS clinic picnic
might bring legal action.

All medical facilities are considered private places when it comes to
patient's rights of privacy.  Many government sites such as schools, military
installations and public clinics are also considered private places.

False light invasion of privacy is closely related to privacy.  This usually
occurs when images and text are juxtaposed in such a way that the subjects of
the images are cast in a false light.  A brochure designed to raise money for
the homeless that shows a photo of two women in ragged clothes in the park
labeled as homeless prostitutes might constitute a false light invasion of
privacy if in fact the women were simply university students wearing grunge
clothes.

**Copyrights and Other Rights**  
Always use the copyright symbol with the date and the name of the creator.  
Any original creative material is considered to be copyrighted, even if it has
not been registered.

Creators can sue for copyright infringement whether registered or not.

Use of trademarks, service marks, trade characters or similar symbols from
other organizations used in your publications must use the symbols in print,
video or web sites and other visual media or in audible format for sound
recordings.

**Government Regulators**  
U.S. Postal Service -classes of mail, size and weight of mail, lotteries,
fraud  
Securities and Exchange Commission- stock and financial markets information  
Federal Trade Commission- deceptive advertising and promotional materials  
Food and Drug Administration- closely monitors educational, drug companies and
scientific promotions  
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms- monitors misleading information concerning
these and other issues  
Federal Communications Commission- regulates broadcast, cable and other
communications technologies, sets ownership rules

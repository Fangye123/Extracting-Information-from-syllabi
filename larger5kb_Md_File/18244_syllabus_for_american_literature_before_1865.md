TEXTS:  
The Norton Anthology of American Literature, Vol. 1

COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
This course is designed as an intensive overview of American literature from
the Colonial period to the Civil War.  We will examine selected themes and
structures in American literature, focusing mainly on constructions of gender,
race, and class in national discourses.  We will trace the historical
transformations of colonialism and imperialism and developments (and re-
developments) of  national identity.  In examining the work of American
writers, we will explore larger questions of what constitutes individual and
cultural identity within the formation of the nation.  Much of the reading
material is appropriate for high school study.

COURSE OBJECTIVES:  
Upon completion of the course, dedicated students who work on the literature
three hours for every hour spent in class will be able to:

1)  Identify themes and characteristics of texts and authors from American
pre-colonial, colonial,         revolutionary, early national, and romantic
periods  
2)  Identify, in a very fundamental way, the major works of each writer
covered in the course and        locate the writer and work in a historical
moment  
3)  Compare authors and works within each historical moment  
4)  Compare authors and works trans-historically  
5)  Analyze works from a range of cultures, works by female authors, and works
by authors of            color  (NCTE 3.5.1.1, 3.5.1.3, 3.5.1.4)  
6)  Classify authors and works according to genre and sub-genres   (NCTE
3.5.2)  
7)  Analyze models of self-identity (based in categories of gender, race,
class etc.) within                     historical and cultural contexts  (NCTE
3.5.1.1, .3, .4)  
8)  Analyze the construction of a national identity within the discourses of
specific historical and         cultural moments  
9)  Synthesize, in written discourse, analysis of self and/or cultural
identities in specific                        literary works with secondary
critical material, researched from sources in the library  
10  Take informed stands on issues pertaining to the study and teaching of
American literature  
11) Evaluate individual texts for inclusion in high school curricula (NCTE
3.5.1.5)

COURSE GUIDELINES:  
Teacher Certification:  
This course will cover, in part, material in the Oklahoma Teacher
Certification Examination, which English majors are required to pass in order
to secure employment.  Prior to the exam, students should review the
introduction to each writer in the anthology, whether the writer has been
covered in class or not.

Assessment:  
Knowledge and skills gained in this class will be assessed as part of the
departmental exit-level assessment program.

Students With Disabilities:  
If you require special accommodations, please contact the Student Support
Services office located in North Hall, Room 114. It is your responsibility to
notify the appropriate University personnel and to make an official request
for academic accommodation.

Plagiarism:  
Representing another's words or ideas as one's own is plagiarism. Turning in
work which has been borrowed from any source will result in termination from
the course and a failing grade.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
Attendance:  
Prompt and regular attendance is expected. More than three absences will
result in a lowered final grade. Students are responsible for all material
covered in class; if you must be absent, get notes and information from a
fellow student. Repeated lateness will be counted as an absence. If you are
more than 15 min. late, you will be marked absent.

If a serious illness or family emergency necessitates more than three absences
you must talk to me as soon as possible, either in person or by telephone or
e-mail.  Also, you must provide a written excuse from the proper authorities.
No matter what the reason, however, I will not accept more than the three
"legitimate" and documented excuses without lowering your final grade.

Reading:  
Expect to spend an average of three hours reading and studying for each class
hour. Each student is expected to have read all assigned materials on time and
to participate in class discussion. It is your responsibility to consult the
schedule and keep up with the reading.  Readings are to be completed before
class on the days they are scheduled.

Papers:  
Students will write three 5 page essays. Detailed instructions for each will
be provided in class.

Mid-Term and Final Exams:  
The mid-term will cover all material up to and including Washington Irving.
The final will cover all material after Irving.

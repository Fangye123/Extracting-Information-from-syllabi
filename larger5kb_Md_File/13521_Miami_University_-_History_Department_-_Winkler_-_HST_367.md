COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course examines political, social, and cultural changes in the United
States in the turbulent decade of the 1960s. It begins by describing the
consensus that existed in the 1950s, and then explores such topics as: the
civil rights movement; the women's movement; the expansion of the welfare
state; the war in Vietnam; the rise of political protest; and the growth of a
counter-culture. The course presupposes no background and provides whatever
framework is necessary to deal with the major issues being discussed.

COURSE EXPECTATIONS

This course seeks to encourage critical thinking about the sources we will
examine. We will look at documents -- both primary and secondary materials --
and ask questions about their authenticity and their validity. We will examine
the arguments of authors, and seek to understand the attitudes and values they
express. At the same time, we will try to explore different ways of
interpreting the past. We will juxtapose the arguments of policy makers, and
historians sympathetic to their positions, with the writings of both radical
and conservative critics and try to understand the nature of the emerging
dialogue. Finally, the course seeks to develop an understanding of the
discipline of history as a subjective exercise, in some ways an art form, in
which the historian tries to piece together an impression of the past. You
should finish the semester with the understanding that there is no such thing
as an objective assessment that explains everything about the past, and with
the awareness that all we can try to do is approximate some sense of reality.  

COURSE REQUIREMENTS

  * Class Attendance: Tuesday & Thursday, 11:00-12:15 AM
  * Oral History Exercise: Due Tuesday, September 18
  * Two Mid-Term Exams: Thursday, September 27 & Thursday, November 8
  * Four-Page Paper: Due Tuesday, November 20
  * Final Exam: Thursday, December 13, at 7:45 PM

ATTENDANCE

Attendance WILL be taken at each class. Your attendance -- and participation
-- are required. If you are absent from class 4 or more times, you will not
pass the course.

FORMAT

The class will follow a discussion format, and each session will focus on the
assigned reading and on material -- songs, slides, films, documents --
presented in class. Participation is a necessary and important part of the
course.

EXAMINATIONS

All 3 exams will be essay tests. The final exam will be comprehensive and will
cover all work done throughout the term.

PAPER

The 4-page paper wil be an analysis of one of the following books: Anne Moody,
_Coming of Age in Mississippi_ ; Betty Friedan, _The Feminine Mystique_ ; Tom
Wolfe, _The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test_ , Tim O'Brien, _The Things They
Carried_ , or Alix Kates Shulman, _Memoirs of an Ex-Prom Queen_. It is meant
to be a critical analysis of the work, indicating what the author is trying to
do, and assessing how well he or she accomplishes the task. It should be well-
thought out and well-written. Good writing makes for a good argument.

ORAL HISTORY EXERCISE

Oral History is an important part of doing research in the contemporary
periiod. You will be asked to take a tape recorder (which can be borrowed from
Applied Technologies, if you do not have one) and interview someone about his
or her experiences in the 1960s. The actual interview should last about 10
minutes. You will be required to turn in the questions you plan in advance to
ask, the tape itself, and a typed transcript. Further details will be provided
in class and posted on Blackboard.

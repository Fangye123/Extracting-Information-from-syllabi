PRE-REGISTRATION

**

Freshmen

**

In October, information concerning pre-registration for the spring semester is
mailed to all freshmen at their local address.

For freshmen spring pre-registration, all regular second semester courses
should be included _._ If a first semester course is failed, adjustments are
made during the first week of the spring semester.

Freshmen should pre-register for the fall semester of their sophomore year in
the department of their chosen major, which occurs in mid-March of the
freshman year.

**

Upperclassmen**

  1. Pre-registration for Sophomores, Juniors, and Seniors is as follows: 
  2. Pre-registration materials including departmental directions and personal pre-registration appointment times are mailed directly to students from the Office of the Registrar.
  3. Upperclassmen then consult their assigned advisors for academic advisement. Students list appropriate course selections only.
  4. The completed pre-registration form is reviewed and approved by the advisor.
  5. Students then proceed with the form to the pre-registration site at the time designated by the Registrar on their pre-registration form in order to obtain appropriate sections for the approved courses.

It is important to note that once you are registered for a course, you will
receive a grade in that course whether or not you attend class; this affects
your GPA. The Course Adjustment or Withdrawal Procedures are the only proper
ways of dropping a course or changing a section.

REGISTRATION

The registration period is designed for students who: (1) transfer into
Engineering, (2) fail courses, or (3) miss the tuition payment deadline.

Students who have properly pre-registered and are not in one of the above
categories are not required to participate in registration.

Freshmen engineers who are not scheduled should consult their academic advisor
for registration counseling, while upperclassmen should consult their
department chairman for proper registration information. Registration provides
the development of an appropriate semester course load listed on a Course
Adjustment (drop/add) form. Once completed and signed for approval, students
visit the drop/add site, which is determined by the Registrar's Office.

CLOSED SECTIONS

Closed course sections are those which have reached their enrollment limit
during the pre-registration or registration periods. During pre-registration,
students should visit the pre-registration site in order to ascertain which
sections are closed.

  1. Students may request permission to enter a closed section in order to resolve schedule conflicts. The procedure is: 
  2. Obtain a "Course Adjustment" (drop/add) form from the Office of the Dean or from the Registrar's Office.
  3. Fill out the form.
  4. Have the form signed by the Chairman of the department offering the course (this applies to both upperclassmen and freshmen).
  5. Return to the course adjustment location designated by the Registrar's Office in order to have the course added to your schedule.

_**

NOTE: Should you be adding any course offered by the College of Arts, you must
obtain the signature of the Dean of Arts and Sciences during the drop/add
period, in Room 105, Saint Augustine Center. Closed Arts courses will normally
accommodate only second-semester seniors or others whose selection is
necessary during a specific semester for graduation.

**_

ENROLLMENT IN A GRADUATE COURSE

A senior undergraduate engineering student may elect to take a graduate-level
course at Villanova. This decision should be made in consultation with the
student's academic advisor. If this option is pursued, the following procedure
should be followed:

  1. The student obtains and completes a Permission to Enter Graduate Course form available from the Engineering Dean's Office, Room 131, Tolentine Hall, or from the Office of the Dean for the College which offers the course.
  2. Approval signatures are secured by the student in the following order: Advisor, Chairperson or Director of Program offering the course, the student's department chairperson, and the Dean of the College, for Colleges other than the College of Engineering.
  3. Student returns the completed form to the Office of the Registrar.

AUDITING A COURSE

A student "audits" a course by attending all scheduled classes and
participating as a regular class member. Tests need not be taken and grades
are not assigned. A student may elect to audit a course to reinforce and
strengthen his/her current knowledge or to explore new areas without the
pressure of tests and grades. No academic credit is earned for auditing a
course. However, the fact that you audited the course is noted on your
official record.

If you feel that auditing would be a beneficial experience, consult your
advisor for guidance. You should not audit a course until after you have
discussed the matter with your advisor.

To obtain audit status, during registration or the course adjustment period,
go to the Registrar's Office and complete an audit form.

PASS/FAIL

Upperclassmen may take one non-major elective course per semester on a
pass/fail basis. The student's department chairman's approval is necessary.
Once approval is obtained and registration completed, the student completes a
pass/fail form in the Registrar's Office. Pass/fail regulations are:

  1. The pass/fail grade will be shown on the student's official record.
  2. No grade points are awarded for passing the course; hence the GPA is not affected.
  3. Failures need not be repeated; however, the student will not receive earned credits for a failed course.
  4. A student must declare election of the pass/fail option during the first five days of class.

CREDIT BY EXAMINATION

Engineering students may obtain credit for certain college-level courses by
means of departmental examinations. First semester freshmen are not eligible
for these examinations which are administered at the beginning of each
semester. Engineering students interested in Credit-by-Examination should
obtain details from Dr. Albert J. Dorley in the Saint Augustine Center Room
450, or call him at (610)519-4607.

CLASS ATTENDANCE

Freshmen are required to attend all class meetings under penalty of possible
failure. Upperclassmen are expected to abide by the attendance policy outlined
by the professor in his or her syllabus. Both engineering freshmen and
upperclassmen should read the Attendance Policy information in the University
Handbook under the section "Class Attendance."

Any special attendance requirements for particular engineering courses should
be provided by your engineering instructors on the first day of class.

A freshman will receive a grade of XF (Failure) whenever he/she has been
absent (unexcused) once more than double the number of weekly meetings of the
course. Excused absences must be approved by the Dean's Office, and are
available only for approved athletic participation, field trips, certified
serious illness, death in the immediate family, or approved job search/
placement activities. Documentation must be provided to support the excused
absence if a student has missed, or anticipates missing, a quiz, exam or oral
presentation.

COURSE INFORMATION

On the first day of class, your engineering instructors should provide the
following information in writing:

  1. A syllabus containing course objectives, an outline of content to be covered, a tentative schedule for tests and projects, and a bibliography including required textbooks for the class.
  2. Information concerning the grading system for the course.
  3. In the case of upperclassmen, the attendance policy for the course. Freshmen should refer to the University Handbook for attendance policy. (See "Class Attendance.")
  4. A copy of his/her policy on making up missed tests, examinations and laboratories, and procedures relating to instances of cheating and academic dishonesty.
  5. Office location and office hours available.

It is the responsibility of the student to read and abide by the syllabus for
each course taken. Faculty should make every effort to adhere to the syllabus,
particularly in the area of grading policy, and should give students
sufficient notice of substantial changes to the syllabus prior to
implementation.

COURSE ADJUSTMENT

Course adjustment is a period at the beginning of each semester for the adding
or dropping of courses. This procedure allows students with conflicts to add
or delete courses from their schedules during the first week of school.
Following is the procedure:

  1. Obtain course adjustment form from either the office of the Dean or the Department Chairman.
  2. Complete the form by listing courses to drop (including section numbers) and courses to add (without specific section numbers; section numbers are added based upon available course openings).
  3. Freshmen should obtain their advisor's signature; upperclassmen should obtain their Department Chairman's or advisor's signature.
  4. Return the completed form to the course adjustment location designated by the Registrar's Office.

COURSE OVERLOAD

The individual Engineering majors are comprised of appropriately sequenced
course groupings referred to as "regular semester course loads." Students
enrolled in the College of Engineering may take up to four credits, or one
course overload, in any given semester provided that: 1) a freshmen has
permission from the Dean of Engineering, or 2) an upperclassman has approval
from his/her advisor and chairman.

Permission forms are available in the Dean's Office, Tolentine 131.

COURSE/TEACHER EVALUATIONS

**

1.** **Regular Semester Course/Teacher Evaluations

**

Each semester, in every engineering course, students are provided with
course/teacher evaluation forms and directions for completing them by their
engineering instructors. The purpose of the regular semester course/teacher
evaluations is to strengthen and improve teaching and the overall engineering
instructional program. Information contained in these evaluations is reviewed
by the individual faculty member, the Department Chairman and the Dean.

**

2.** **Confidentiality of Information Provided by Students

**

All information contained in the individual evaluations that are submitted by
students are held confidential; these are reviewed by the Dean, the Chairman
of the Department in which the course is offered, and the faculty member
teaching the course. The names of the students providing evaluations may not
be ascertained from the forms used in this process, and are therefore not
known by the administrators or the faculty member.

**

3\. Public Access to Summary Reports of Course/Teacher Evaluations

**

The University policy with respect to access to information on teacher
evaluations permits all students access to the summary reports on each course
and teacher evaluated in the University, for the purpose of making informed
choices in registering for courses. These reports are maintained in the Falvey
Library Reserve Room, and are organized by department in which the course is
offered, or in which the professor resides.

COURSE SYLLABI ACCESS

The University Senate requires all professors to submit past syllabi from
their courses for the purpose of making informed choices in registering for
courses. These student reports are maintained in the Falvey Library Reserve
Room, and are organized by department and semester in which the course is
offered.

COMPLAINTS ABOUT FACULTY AND GRADES

Villanova University has a set of procedures for resolving student complaints
about faculty performance or about grades. A student who has concerns about
either of these issues should, if at all possible, discuss the problem
directly with the faculty member. If this is not possible, the student should
contact the faculty member=s department chair or program director who will
provide the student with a copy of the procedures and, if the student wishes,
review the process involved. If the student is, for good reason, reluctant to
contact the department chair, the student may also contact the Dean of the
faculty member=s college. A copy of the procedures is also available on
request from the Academic Affairs Office, 103 Tolentine Hall, 519-4520.

AUTHORIZED WITHDRAWAL FROM A COURSE (WX GRADE)

Course Withdrawal is an option open to all engineering students who decide to
drop a particular course after the drop/add period ends.

See the [Engineering Academic Calendar](../eng_calendar/) for withdrawal
deadlines. Prior to the respective deadlines for authorized withdrawal,
approval of the request to withdraw is automatic; therefore, a student may
drop a particular course for any reason simply by completing the withdrawal
form.

If withdrawal is desired after the deadlines, a legitimate reason is required.
In either case, a request for an authorized withdrawal is initiated by
obtaining the appropriate form in the Office of the Dean. Instructions are
provided on the form and are self-explanatory. Students should allow a week
for a decision to be made by the Dean on their request. Consultation with the
student's academic advisor should precede the initiation of a request for an
Authorized Withdrawal.

It is important to remember that a student may add or delete courses during
the first five days of a given semester, by completing the Course Adjustment
form. Authorized Withdrawal addresses the problem of dropping a course after
the course adjustment (drop/add) period. A course that is dropped during drop/
add will not be listed on the permanent transcript. A course for which an
authorized withdrawal is granted will be listed on the permanent transcript as
"WX," but will not affect the cumulative or current grade point average.
Because a student receives a grade for every course in which he/she is
registered, utilizing these two procedures correctly is of utmost importance.

GRADES, GPA AND REPORTS

1\. Grades

Grades are assigned twice during the academic semester. Mid-term grades are
mailed to the student's local address at mid-semester and final grades are
mailed to the student's home at the conclusion of the semester. Engineering
students should consult the current University Handbook to determine the
current policy and procedures concerning the assignment of these grades. Only
final grades are entered on the student's official record. Please note
information under the title "Grading System and Student Averages" in the
University Catalog.

2\. Grade Point Averages (GPA)

A. Semester Grade Point Average

> A semester Grade Point Average is calculated by utilizing point values which
correspond to the letter grades a student receives in all the courses taken
during that semester. These values are as follows:

| **Letter Grade** | **Grade Points** | **Letter Grade** | **Grade Points**  
---|---|---|---  
A | 4.0 | C | 2.0  
A- | 3.67 | C- | 1.67  
B+ | 3.33 | D+ | 1.33  
B | 3.0 | D | 1.0  
B- | 2.67 | D- | 0.67  
C+ | 2.33 | F | None  
  
The following example of semester grades will illustrate the process of
calculating the GPA.

**Course** | **Grade** | **Credits Attempted** | **Grade Points Earned**  
---|---|---|---  
Chemistry | B- | 4 x 2.67 | 10.68  
English | C  | 3 x 2.0 | 6.0  
Engineering | A | 3 x 4.0 | 12.0  
Mathematics | F | 4 x 0 | 0.0  
Theology | C+ | 3 x 2.33 | 6.99  
  | **17** | **35.67** **  
  
   **GPA = _Total Grade Points Earned_ = _35.67_   = 2.10  
               Total Credits Attempted        17.0

B. Cumulative Grade Point Average

The Cumulative Grade Point Average is the average of all course work in all
semesters that courses were taken at V

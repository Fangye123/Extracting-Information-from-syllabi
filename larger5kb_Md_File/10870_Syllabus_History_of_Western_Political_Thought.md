_Educational Philosophy:_  
Educational research demonstrates that a student should spend three hours
studying for each hour spent in the classroom. I believe this is a minimum and
have organized the class accordingly. If you do not feel you are willing or
able to invest this level of effort/commitment please reconsider enrolling in
this class. You will save yourself a great deal of grief.  
  
For those who choose to remain in this course, I would like to encourage
cooperation among the students of this class. You may work together in many
ways. You can discuss the reading assignment among yourselves or you can talk
about the discussion topics outside of class. It is important to note, that
while you may discuss amongst yourselves the Critiques, the writing assignment
is intended to be single authored! Students frequently report, and it had been
empirically demonstrated, that it is helpful to study together in small
groups.  
  
_Attendance_  
This is a lecture course supplemented by discussion and readings. Absence from
lecture will prove highly detrimental to one's understanding of the material
and should be avoided. Attendance will be taken each day, and repeated
absences will adversely affect your final grade (see below). In addition,
continuous tardiness will not be accepted and will also negatively impact your
grade. It is the students' responsibility to find and sign the attendance
sheet at the end of class if the sheet did not come by you during class. Only
under exceedingly unusual circumstances will there be excused absences--so use
absences wisely.

_Grades_  
Grading is based upon a traditional scale (there is no "curving" of tests
and/or course grades). Due to privacy concerns grades will not be posted,
given out via telephone or emailed to students. I do not give out grades prior
to the Registrar sending them to you.  
  
100% - 90% = A  
89% - 80% = B  
79% - 70% = C  
69% - 60% = D  
59% or below = F  
  
_Theoretical Essays_  
One-page essays must include 1) a clearly articulated thesis/theme of each
philosopher work; 2) the arguments used to support be the author's
thesis/theme. No personal opinion of yours should appear until the last
paragraph where you discuss which author best supports their thesis. By using
examples from the reading or the real world gives examples of why you hold
this view.  
  
The summaries must be typed single-spaced and be one complete page. Only your
name and the philosopher's name would appear on the essay - your name bottom
right-hand corner and the philosopher's top centered. Do not put professor's
name, date, class name, school affiliation, or planet of original origins on
the summary. I know my name, what class it is, your school affiliation and do
not care about your planet of origin. It is your responsibility to convince me
that a modicum of thought went into the authoring of the document.  
  
The one-page summaries will be graded from 0 - 5 points. The essays are graded
on your ability to convey an understanding of the theorist's ideas/philosophy.
You only have one page in which to work, so do not get bogged down in
historical and superfluous details. Stay focused upon what the theorist is
trying to convey. It is not fancy creative rhetorical prose I am interested
in; be straightforward and tell me about the political theory. There should be
no quotes. Your lowest score will be dropped.  
  
_Academic Support_  
Culver-Stockton provides tutorial assistance to any student who takes the
initiative to visit the office in Johnson 126 (phone # 6415). Personal
experience and empirical research demonstrates that the earlier in the
semester and more regularly a student takes advantage of the resources
available through the tutoring lab the better will be the results.  
  
_Special Circumstances_  
If you possess a special circumstance (visual or auditory impairment, a
communication disorder, and/or other condition); which may effect your
performance in this class, you should schedule an appointment with the
instructor (as soon as possible), so reasonable adjustments or provisions may
be discussed to better insure that you will have an equitable opportunity to
meet all the course requirements.  
  
_Miscellaneous_  
Students should review the student code of conduct and be aware of those
activities defined as academic dishonesty. This syllabus is not a binding
contract. Instructor has the right to make unannounced adjustments to the
syllabus.  
  
_Reading Assignments_  
Students are expected to understand, and be able to integrate the reading
assignments into the general themes of class. Reading is meant to be an active
endeavor. Reading an assigned chapter or article is not the same as reading
Sport Illustrated, Danelle Steel, or Tom Clancy. Students often find they need
"relearn" how to read. For many students outlining the readings is necessary
in order to successfully grasp the information being conveyed. It is expected
that student thoroughly read, take notes and/or outline the assignments-
additionally, students should look up words/concepts they do not understand.  
  
Remember you are reading a great deal of primary sources. Some of these works
were written over 400 years ago, many of them were written in a language other
than modern English, and all of them are philosophical or theoretical to one
degree or another. This means that the reading assignments will be
challenging. You must do more that read the piece once. There will be
vocabulary word that needs to be looked, etc. There will be paragraphs that
you will need to read several times before you understand what the author is
talking about. It is this challenge to learn to read these works, and your
increasing ability to understand them, that is the real education in your
life. I recommend you read the primary source; then read the introductory
section and then reread the primary source. You should read the primary source
at lest twice. You can take shortcuts, but you will suffer the consequences
later.

_Critical Book Analysis_  
  
Each student must critically and thoroughly digest the assigned readings and
then write a well thought-out review essay. The essay must be typed double-
spaced, exactly five pages, stapled with proper one-inch margins. In addition,
proper citations must be used throughout the essay (professor recommends in-
text citations). Due to the fact you are using only one source you only need
to utilize the page number e.g. (175). You are expected to have a minimum of
15 citations.  
  
You might want to look at some scholarly book reviews from the academic
journals: The American Political Science Review, Journal of Politics, or World
Politics. Do not make the mistake of looking up book reviews on the book(s)
assigned-because I already have. The Critical Book Analysis is worth 100
points.  
  
_Guide to Writing  
Critical Book/Article Reviews_  
  
Your review should be a finished, polished piece of work. It should be headed
by a full bibliographic citation that includes the author's name, the book's
title, the place of publication, publisher, date of publication, number of
pages, and other contents, such as maps and tables. For example:  
  
Eggers, William D. & John O'Leary Revolution at the Roots: Making our
Government Smaller, Better, and Closer to Home (New York: The Free Press,
1995. Pp. x, 422).  
  
Drake, Christine. Water Resource Conflicts in the Middle East. Geography
January February pp. 4-12, 1997.  
  
Jervis, Robert. Realism, Neoliberalism, and Cooperation: Understanding the
Debate. International Security Vol. 24, No. 1, pp. 42-63, 1999.  
  
Gilbert, Felix. Machiavelli: The Renaissance of the Art of War. In Makers of
Modern Strategy: Military Thought from Machiavelli to Hitler, edited by Edward
Mead Earle. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, pp. 3-25, 1943).  
  
Keep in mind that a critical book/article review (CBAR) is not a book report.
A book report merely summarizes the contents of a book while a CBAR,
articulates the author's thesis, provides the author's argument in support of
the thesis, and provides critical analysis and commentary.  
  
_I Goal of a Critical Analysis_  
[_] Identify the author's theme or thesis. Why did the author write the book?
What is the author trying to demonstrate? It is not enough to simply identify
the subject; you must tell what the author says about it. It should be obvious
what you are articulating the author's thesis. I recommend that you literally
state, "The thesis of the article/book is" or the "The author's thesis is."
Remember, a book cannot have a thesis of its own, only the author can have a
thesis.  
[_] Identify the scope and aims of the work.  
[_] Explain how the author supports the thesis and assess the author's success
in supporting it.  
[_] Explain what kind of evidence the author uses to support the conclusions.
Be specific - do not simply say the author uses primary or secondary sources.
Identify the type of sources: oral interviews, personal papers, newspaper
accounts, census data, etc.  
[_] Demonstrate to the reader of your review that you understood the
argument(s) well enough to provide an informed opinion of whether other people
should read this book.  
  
_II Suggested Structure_  
A. Prewriting  
[_] Read the complete book carefully, pausing to think about what the writer
is trying to do. Take careful notes. It might be wise to stop at the end of
each chapter and summarize in a paragraph what the author said.  
[_] Look into what the author has written previously. It this an established
scholar writing in their specialty or is the work outside their noted
expertise?  
  
B. Review Structure  
1\. Opening Paragraphs  
[_] Your first paragraph, especially your opening sentence, should arrest the
casual reader and pique their interest. Do not repeat information in the body
of your review that is included in the bibliographic heading. A particularly
poor opening sentence repeats the author's name and the book's title (why?
because it is in the bibliographic heading!).  
2\. Body of the Review  
[_] The review should be structured into a series of short paragraphs (no more
that 1/3 page long), each devoted to a single aspect of your critical
evaluation.  
[_] Each argument the author(s) uses to support their thesis should be
addressed in one or two paragraphs. Within each paragraph clearly articulate
the argument, examples of the argument, and how it supports the author's
thesis.  
3\. Critical Analysis (Ending Paragraphs)  
[_] Evaluate the author's style. For example, is it narrative or analytical?  
[_] If the book/article is part of a series, identify the series.  
[_] What are the author's qualifications to write this book/article? If the
author brings any special experience or training to the work, identify and
explain them.  
[_] Identify the audience to which the book/article is directed.  
[_] Be certain that someone who has not read the book/article will understand
it after reading your review.  
[_] Did the author support their thesis?  
[_] Did the author persuade you with their thesis and argument? Would this
line of reasoning persuade an ORP (ordinary reasonable person)?  
  
C. Post-Writing  
[_] Write the first draft of your review. Set the draft aside for a day or two
before revising it into a second draft.  
[_] Review these guidelines before starting your second draft.  
[_] Have a couple of other people read a later draft and comment on its
quality.  
[_] Proofread your manuscript carefully before submitting it. Friends can help
proof-read, but ultimately it is your work and thus your grade/reputation that
is at stake.  
  
_III Common Mistakes to Avoid_  
[_] Do not write in the first person (e.g., say: "This is a good book," not "I
think this is a good book"). The entire review is your opinion.  
[_] Do not refer to the instructor and/or class (e.g., "as you said in class"
or "as was discussed in class")  
[_] Paragraphs should be concise (approximately 1/3 of a page long or less)  
[_] Do not use of slang or jargon (e.g., "nuke the crap out of them")  
[_] Do not say, "The author thinks" or "The author feels" you have no idea
what the author thinks or feels; you only know what they have written, say
rather, "The author argues," or "The author states." One "feels" with one of
the senses.  
[_] Do not use contractions (e.g., don't, wouldn't, etc.).  
[_] Do not repeat items or facts, which the reader can be expected to know.
For example, assume that the reader knows Japan attacked Pearl Harbor on 7
December 1941.  
[_] Do not use hyperbole (e.g., "This is the best book ever written on the
subject.")  
[_] Do not put a cover-sheet or bibliography page on your review.  
[_] Do not put professor's name, date, class name, school affiliation, or your
planet of original origins on your review. I know my name, what class it is,
your school affiliation and do not care about your planet of origin.  
  
_IV Style and Grammar Reminders_  
[_] It is usually best to use the present tense when writing about the book or
author and the past tense when discussing the subject of the book. For
example: "The author believes that Halsey was well prepared...."  
[_] Use the active voice whenever possible, but remember that there are times
when the passive voice is more appropriate. Until you can identify passive
voice, write in the active voice. An example of passive voice would be: "The
ball was kicked by the child." To make the sentence active, one would write:
"The child kicked the ball."  
[_] Any time you use an idea from a book/article it should be followed by the
page number placed in parentheses (271).  
[_] There should be no quotes. Take what the author is saying and rephrase it
in your own words. Taking a sentence and changing a couple of words and
writing it in your essay is considered plagiarism. For example this is from an
article; "Gura claimed that there was a tendency among historians to regard
American Puritanism as being homogenous despite the well-known presence of
prominent dissenters for the prevailing Puritan tradition." Therefore, this
would be considered plagiarism; "Philip Gura said that there is a tendency by
scholars to view Puritanism as homogeneous even though there is a presence of
prominent disagreement from that tradition."  
[_] Avoid using the word "prove," in the social science nothing is "proven."
Evidence is presented to support a particular view. For example, do not say
"The author attempts to prove his/her thesis;" instead say the "The author
provides evidence to support his/her thesis"  
[_] Your name should appear only on the last page justified on the right
margin.  
[_] Capitalize when referring to a specific: Congress, but not congressmen;
Senator, but not senators; Constitution, but not constitutional; Queen
Elizabeth, but not the queens of England; President Johnson, but not the
presidents of the United States.  
[_] Use two hyphens (--) to represent a dash with no spaces between the words
and the hyphens; use square brackets ([ ]) to enclose parentheses within
parentheses.  
[_]  
Place commas and periods within quotation marks; colons and semi-colons are
always placed outside the quotation marks.  
[_] A preposition is not a good word to end a sentence with.  
[_] And do not begin or end a sentence with a conjunction.  
[_] Avoid clich¨¦s like the plague - they're old hat.  
[_] Avoid colloquialisms, you know what I mean.  
[_] Avoid abbreviations in your text except for titles, such as Dr., Mr., or
Jr.  
[_] Ellipses in a quotation should be indicated by three periods with a space
between each ( . . . ); ellipses at the end of a sentence require a fourth
period with the first in the immediate space following the last letter of the
last word quoted.  
[_] Never use an ellipsis mark at the beginning of a quotation to indicate
omission.  
[_] If you interpolate any words of your own in a quotation, indicate them in
square brackets. The same applies to the use of "sic" (always italicized)
following an error of logic, fact or spelling in a quotation to indicate the
error is not yours in transcribing the original text of the writer.  
[_] When you quote from a primary source reproduced in a secondary source,
always indicate in your footnote that it is "Quoted in" that secondary source.  
[_] The first time you mention a person in your paper, identify the person by
full name. Exceptions are very famous personages such as kings and presidents.  
[_] Avoid, when possible, listing as (1), (2), (3), etc., and indenting the
items listed. Try to work the ideas into sentences so the flow of your
narrative will not be interrupted.  
[_] Do not say "Since he opposed the strategy," but "Because he opposed." The
word "since" connotes passage of time.  
[_] Avoid one-sentence paragraphs at all times. A paragraph should contain an
introductory transition sentence, sentences developing your thought and a
concluding sentence that will permit transition to the next paragraph.  
[_] Avoid verbosity and $20 words. Your writing should be clear and concise.  
[_] Be consistent in using the same tense in a sentence. Usually historical
narrative is written in the past tense. Reviews are written in present tense
when talking about the author's arguments, however.  
[_] Try to balance your writing between simple and compound sentences.  
[_] Avoid digressions and awkward repetitions.  
[_] Do not use double negatives.  
[_] Buy a thesaurus and improve your style by using synonyms.  
  
_Penalties for not following directions_  
[_] Evidence that at least two other people have read and commented on your
paper. Remember your grade depends how well you select a reader of your essay!
10 points  
[_] All notes/rough drafts must be handed in with final copy. Simply
highlighting in the book is not acceptable for fulfilling this direction 20
points  
[_] Not handing in two copies of the final draft. 10 points  
[_] If directions are not followed exactly 05 points  
  
_NOTE:_ In the library, I have several CBA on reserve for your perusal.
Students have written several of them. None are perfect, but several are quite
good. I would strongly recommend taking a look at good example of what I
expect.

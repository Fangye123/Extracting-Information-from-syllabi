**Course Description:**   Growth, a fundamental characteristic of life, may be
studied from a number of approaches: molecular biology, behavior and
cognition, physical growth processes, and even growth of organisms in
ecological and evolutionary perspectives. We will review a variety of
perspectives on human growth, but emphases will be placed on human variation
during the life cycle and biobehavioral aspects of growth as aspects of human
adaptation to variable environments. The life cycle refers to conception and
reproduction (in adults), gestation and birth of the fetus, growth of the
infant through childhood and adolescence to maturity, attainment of the
capability to reproduce, and continued change through senescence and death.
Knowledge of human growth and reproduction is valuable for all persons whether
they be students in health, biobehavioral, biomedical, or social sciences. On
the practical side, anyone who plans to reproduce and raise children to
adulthood should have at least a working knowledge of human growth,
development, and aging.

**Conduct of the Course:    **There will be a midterm about the 6th or 7th
week of classes that will count for 40% of the final grade. A term project,
including an in-class presentation of student term projects, will count for
40% of your final grade. Presentation of your project will count 10% of your
grade, while the last 10% will be derived from in-class discussions of current
literature.

**Grading:   **Final grades are based vn standardized distribution, using the
total number of points for the course. A general guide to how you are doing is
A  92; A- 90-91; B+ 88-89; B 82-87; B- 80-81; C+ 78-79; C 72-77; C- 70-71; D+
68-69; D 60-67; E< 60.

**Research/Project Topics:**   Your term project will be an in-depth review of
the literature on a topic of your choice. Your final 12 page paper will be a
double-spaced typed manuscript with 1 inch margins. Please limit it to 12
pages of concise text. Include as many additinal pages of illustrations and
tables as you needed to document the text and have a _minimum_ of 15  
references. No more that 4 references should be from the course Reading List,
no more than 5 references should pre-date 1975, and no more that 5 should
refer to books or book chapters. Books are notoriously out-of-date and
molecular methods and findings have been overwhelming in the past decade. An
in-class 10-20 minute presentation of your project will be conducted during
weeks 8-10. Below some suggested topics are listed. Note that many of the age-
specific topics can be altered ( e.g. "Precocious Puberty" to "Precocious
Aging").

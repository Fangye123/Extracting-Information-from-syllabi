> This interdisciplinary course explores various cultural and social
transformations in American society from the post-Civil War era to the
present. Broadly construed, this course will examine the relationship between
culture, technology, industrialization, urbanization, and American identity
(using race, gender and class as ways to analyze America's multicultural
society) over the last century and a half. After a brief, introductory
exploration of the enormous social, cultural and economic changes wrought by
the Civil War-the bloodiest conflagration in American history-we will study
the cultural landscape of a rapidly industrializing society in which roaring
locomotives created a new sense of time and national identity . Our journey
will take us from the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad to the moon
landing and internet. Along the way, we will also consider the rise of the
consumer society, the birth of mass culture, immigration, overseas expansion,
modernism, feminism, regionalism and the new leisure culture. Our examination
of American culture is interdisciplinary and broadly defined to include fine
arts, sports, music, literature, popular culture, architecture, anthropology,
social thought, the built environment and material culture. Ultimately, our
goal is to investigate and evaluate how multiple Americans-from presidents to
the dispossessed-have made sense of explosive social transformations through
various forms of cultural expression.

> **Class format:** This is primarily a lecture course, but I will always
leave some time available during each class for discussion. We will not
discuss the assigned books in great detail during class, so if you are having
trouble integrating the lecture material with the reading assignments, please
see your TA or me for guidance. Please note that the dates listed for the
reading assignments are merely suggested completion dates. However, I strongly
suggest that you complete the assigned readings BEFORE the exam if you want to
do well in the course.

>

> **Requirements:** Regular attendance, completion of all reading assignments,
an in-class midterm exam, a second midterm take-home exam, and a final exam.

>

> **Grading:** First exam (in-class): 25%; Second exam (take-home): 30%; Final
exam: 45 %. A: 90-100; B: 80-89; C: 70-79; D: 60-69; F: 0-59.

>

> **Exam format:** The first in-class exam will contain five short
identification questions (choice of ten) and an essay question (choice of
two). The second test will be a take-home essay (TYPED, DOUBLE-SPACED, 12 PT.
FONT, ONE-INCH MARGINS, NO LONGER THAN FIVE PAGES) based on material from the
second section of the course (choice of two questions). The final exam will
contain five short identification questions (choice of ten) from the second
and third sections of the course, an essay which focuses on material from the
last section of the course (choice of two), and a final essay based on
material from throughout the semester (choice of two). In order to write a
successful essay, you will be expected to support your answer with evidence
from the assigned readings (where appropriate), lectures and other media like
film clips, music, or slides shown in class. For this reason, regular class
attendance is critical in order to do well in the course. NOTE: There will be
a review session before each test: I will announce the times and locations in
class.  
>  
>  **Make-up policy:** Failure to take a scheduled examination without making
prior arrangements will result in an automatic zero for that exam. I will
allow you to take a make-up exam only in the event of a medical or family
emergency, religious holiday, or if you have official, documented University
of Texas at Austin business outside of campus. In both cases, you must notify
me or the T.A.s BEFORE the scheduled exam. All make-up exams must be taken
within one week of the scheduled exam. I strongly advise against make-up exams
for a couple reasons: 1) your retention of the material will be weaker at a
later date, and consequently, you may perform more poorly than you might in
class 2) the questions on the make-up exam are likely to be more difficult
than those on the scheduled test because I will ask the most obvious questions
on the in-class exam.

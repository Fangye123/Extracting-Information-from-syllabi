### History 557.02  
Jeffersonian and Jacksonian Democracy  
The History of the Early Republic, 1800-1845



The course examines the social and political history of postrevolutionary
America. We will study the impact of the Revolution and economic development
on American communities and on the American people, particularly on women,
slaves, and Native Americans. Our goal will be to understand the national
community that emerged from America's disruptive, multifaceted revolution, and
to consider the enduring problems that republican communities face.

**FINAL EXAMINATION: Monday, June 9 -- 7:30-9:18**



* * *

**_Written Assignment_ (30% of final grade)**

Paper: due **Monday, May 26.** You are to write a historiographical essay (6-8
pages) on two or more historical works. The purpose of the essay is to
understand the values, beliefs, experiences, and feelings of historians quite
unlike yourselves. I recommend that you ask a bold question in your essay that
will force you to come to grips with the differences between you and the
historians you choose to examine, a question that will force you to explain
how and why your historians' views of the past differs from your own (and/or
that of other historians), and that can help you recognize problems in your
historians' (or your own) use of evidence, social theory, or definitions. Be
sure to state that question in your title and in your first paragraph, and to
offer a provisional answer to that question (a thesis statement) at the end of
your first paragraph. Whatever you do, please do not title your paper  "First
Paper" or " Historiographical Essay. " Mr.Roth gets very dispirited when you
do things like that, so please don't. Remember, a good title will help you
focus your thoughts and force you to state your question clearly.

Suggested topics:

  1. Barney, Levy, and Hofstadter. Sample titles: Did Thomas Jefferson Believe in Democracy? Liberty? Was Jefferson a Man of the People? A Radical?
  2. Wilentz, Barney, Ulrich, Blassingame, Edmunds. Sample titles: Was America a society of consensus or conflict? Did Christianity bind Americans together or drive them apart?
  3. Barney, Remini, Blassingame, Ulrich, Hofstadter, Edmunds. Sample title: Does it matter to historians of the politics of the early republic that half the population of the United States was female? That one-fifth of the population was of African descent? That Native Americans controlled two fifths of the nation's territory?
  4. Note that the key to understanding the work of these historians lies in comprehending the political beliefs and social attitudes of historians, and the ways in which they shaped or failed to shape interpretations of the past. 

NOTE: You have the option of rewriting your paper for credit. The final grade
on the assignment will be the average of the grades on the first and second
drafts. The rewrites will be due at the final examination.



**_Examinations_ (60% of final grade)**

  * Quizzes (15 %): We will have four or five quizzes ( 10 to 15 minutes each) in class over the course of the quarter. You will be asked to discuss a passage or a problem in the reading for the previous two weeks. Each quiz will be announced at least two days in advance. The purpose of the quizzes is to reward you for keeping up with the reading, not to trip you up.
  * Midterm (15%) and Final (30%) examinations: We will have a midterm essay examination on Monday, May 5 and a final essay examination on Monday, June 9, 7:30-9:18. You will answer one essay question on the midterm and two essay questions on the final. Each essay question will give you a choice among several questions. 



**_Discussion and Participation_ (10 % of final grade)**

Class attendance and participation are required. Everyone begins with a grade
of "C" in discussion, which can be raised by active participation or lowered
by poor attendance. Remember: it is as important to ask questions in class as
it is to answer them. If you attend class and ask questions regularly, you
will have no difficulty earning an "A" in discussion. It's a great deal.
Please take advantage of it!

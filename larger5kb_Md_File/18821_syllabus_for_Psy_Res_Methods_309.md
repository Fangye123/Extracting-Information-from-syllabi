**Description of course:**

An introduction to the fundamentals of research design and applications of
research methodologies for studying behavior. The epistemological
underpinnings of research strategies will be discussed, as well as the
practicalities of using these strategies. Students will perform laboratory
exercises designed to familiarize them with designing, conducting, and
evaluating die results of psychological research.

**0bjectives:**

I. To gain an increased understanding of the application of scientific methods
to the study of psychological phenomena.

2\. To learn to collect data for the purpose of answering an experimentally
derived question and report the results in conformance to APA style.

3\. To enable the student to determine the appropriate statistical techniques
used to analyze various experimental designs.

4\. To familiarize the student with shortcomings inherent in various
experimental designs.

Class Format: Lecture and discussion of assigned materials and class project.

Quality of Research **__The important aspects in judging quality will be how
well you were able to develop the literature review, report your results, and
draw conclusions from the results. This means integrating the literature
(theories and opinions), offering explanations for resolving conflicting
research findings, and drawing reasonable conclusions based on what you
found,__**

Grammar/proofreading: It is imperative that the paper be grammatically correct
and edited carefully. You must include a definitive title and a one page
abstract.

Length: The paper must be in APA style and no longer than 15 pages (without
references).

Original sources: You will be expected to find original sources for your
references and will he asked to bring a copy of the title page and abstract to
verify that you were able to find the original. Secondary sources may be cited
only rarely and only if the original is unavailable from tile University of
Maryland library system.

Class attendance and submission of assignments is essential. Failure to submit
assignments when due and absence from class may result in a decrement of your
grade.

Policy on Academic Integrity (Plagiarism): see more detail at [Plagiarism
(Tulane)](http://www.tulane.edu/~jruscher/dept/plagiarism.html)

"Plagiarism is the intentional or unintentional presentation of another
person's idea or product as one's own. Plagiarism includes, but is not limited
to the following: copying verbatim all or part of another's written work;
using phrases, charts, figures, illustrations, or mathematical or scientific
solutions without citing the source; paraphrasing ideas, conclusions, or
research without citing the source; and using all or part of a literary plot,
poem, film, musical score, or other artistic product without attributing the
work to its creator. Students can avoid unintentional plagiarism by carefully
_accepted scholarly_ practices. Notes taken for papers and research projects
should accurately record sources of material to be cited, quoted, paraphrased,
or summarized, and papers should acknowledge these sources in footnotes."

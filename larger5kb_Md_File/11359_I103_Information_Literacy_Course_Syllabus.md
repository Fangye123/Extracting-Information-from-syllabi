**

###  Note: Students must do the final project and take the final exam to pass
the class.

  1. Attendance is absolutely necessary! 

  2. If you know that you will have to miss a class let me know. If you miss a class on a day that a quiz is scheduled, you can only take the quiz if I am notified prior to class that you will miss. Students who don't make prior arrangements will not get the opportunity to take the quiz. (You may call the library before class to leave a message at 973-8226.) 

  3. Assignments may be reworked. If you get 10 out of the 20 points possible, then you may re-do the assignment to get the other 10 points. You may re-do an assignment as many times as it takes. 

  4. Anyone working on an assignment in class while the rest of the class is doing something else (i.e. following along, paying attention, etc.) will lose the opportunity to hand in that assignment.

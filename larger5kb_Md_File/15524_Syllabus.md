# Syllabus: The Construction of Others in America

This course is intended to help students understand the various ways in which
Americans have been alienated in the past, and to analyze the ways in which
that alienation continues. The objective is to learn to criticize assumptions,
and apply the knowledge gained from doing so to new contexts.

The following readings are intended to give a sense of how individuals and
groups have been marginalized and disenfranchised in America. This
marginalization has been the result of various social, psychological,
religious and legal constructs. The following works analyze these constructs,
and suggest ways to deconstruct them in order to understand the power
relationships they sustain.

These works, taken together, do not provide an in-depth look at Others, nor do
they indicate the breadth of "otherizing" in America. Hence they should not be
considered exhaustive of any particular aspect of American culture, nor should
they be considered an overview of American otherizing. They do, however,
suggest the myriad ways in which constructions of "otherness" manifest
themselves in American culture, how deeply embedded constructions of otherness
are, and how far-reaching and subtle their effects can be.

**_Course Requirements_**

Grades will be based on four papers (20% each) and class discussion (20%).

_Papers_ : Papers will be short (about 5 pages) essays in which students will
make connections between the historical examples in the readings and current
public policies or events. The papers should analyze some contemporary (1990s)
event with a view toward explicating the ways in which Othering has or has not
changed over time. So--to use several articles from a recent (5/19/99)
Washington Post as examples--papers might: describe US foreign policy in Iraq
as a rearticulation of Orientalism; discuss the Fed's announcement that it
expects to raise interest rates as an example of the power of global capital
to control the terms of economic debate in America; show how the current
debate over "racial profiling" is similar to or different from previous
debates over "racialized" policies; position debates over gun control
legislation within the context of America's violent past, or analyze the
degree to which those debates would be possible without the powerful media
images emanating from Littleton, CO.; or speculate on how the new Israeli
government's policies might affect the ways in which American Jews interact
with other groups of Americans; or whatever. Students will be expected to
discuss their paper ideas with the class and with me. Each paper will be worth
20% of the total course grade. Students may write a longer (about 15 pages)
paper for their final paper and skip the 3rd one if they want--this is
recommended for people who find their papers getting longer and time getting
shorter toward the end of the semester.

_Class Discussion_ : Discussions will occur in class and on a reflector (which
will allow people in the class to post email messages to everyone else in the
class). Hence, each student will be required to have an email account. Email
will allow students to continue class discussion from the previous class, ask
questions about the material for the next class, and share personal
experiences that exemplify some of the connections we're trying to make. I
will read messages and comment on them in person.

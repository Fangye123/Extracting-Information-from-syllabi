This course will examine some major crises in the history and development of
the western world from its beginnings to the end of the Reformation.
Throughout the course students will be urged to follow patterns of continuity,
to identify causes of change, and to draw their own conclusions about the
roots of western culture.

Required Texts:  
  
Sowards, J. Kelley. _Makers of the Western Tradition: Portraits from History_.
vol. 1. 7th ed. Boston: Bedford Books, 1997.

Spielvogel, Jackson J. _Western Civilization_ , vol. 1: _To 1715_. 3rd ed. St.
Paul: West Publishing Company, 1997.

Course Requirements:

Approximately 2/3 of the classes will be conducted in lecture format, using
PowerPoint, but they may also involve a more general discussion of the
assigned topic. Assigned portraits from the Sowards books will provide the
basis for class discussions. All students will be expected to contribute to
these discussion sessions and to demonstrate that they have read assigned
materials. I also strongly recommend that you make arrangements to come in to
see me in my office at least once during the semester, preferably early in the
year. I can do a better job of guiding the class if I know you as individuals
and have a chance to explore your personal interests and concerns. If our
schedules conflict, I will be happy to set up appointments for times before or
after my regular hours.

Members of the class should familiarize themselves with the resources
available to them in the computer lab. I will communicate with the class via a
distribution list and will expect everyone to check e-mail frequently.
Additional reading assignments may be assigned from World Wide Web sites, such
as ORB  or other library collections. My web site at  contains copies of this
syllabus, writing guidelines, copies of the PowerPoint presentations, and
other helpful tips. Take time to discover what is available and use it to your
own advantage.

Writing Assignments: Each student will submit eight short papers reacting to
quotations taken from the readings. Instructions for these appear under the
appropriate dates in the syllabus.

There will be two exams during the semester: a midterm and a final exam that
will cover the entire course. All exams will be in essay format, and students
will be expected to include material gathered from assigned reading and from
lecture and discussion sessions. Essays will be graded on both content and
composition.

Attendance is mandatory; if you must miss class because of illness, please
notify me immediately, either by phone or by e-mail. Final grades will reflect
both participation and attendance. You may assume that your final grade in
this class will be no higher than the percentage of classes you attend. (This
class meets 42 times. If you miss 5 classes, your attendance is 88%, which
would be a B+.) Assuming that your attendance is regular, final grades will be
based on the following scale:

Eight short papers 40% (5% apiece)  
Midterm 20%  
Final Exam 30%  
Participation 10%

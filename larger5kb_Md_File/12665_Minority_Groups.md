Minority Groups - Syllabus

    
    
    **Course Description**
    
    This course will address the history, theories, problems and
    controversies surrounding racial and ethnic relations in the
    United States.  My perspective as the instructor of this course is
    that the foundation of this society has been built on ethnic, racial
    and class division and oppression:  from the genocide of nations of
    Native Americans in the search for slaves and gold; to the enslavement
    of Africans and African-Americans to form the economic and social
    system through much of our history; to the pitting of one immigrant
    group against another to ensure cheap, exploitable labor in industry;
    to the forced assimilation of immigrant groups as a "solution" to
    urban crime; to the identification of various ethnic groups as enemies
    of the state at one point in time or another.  We will address the
    controversies around "Blaming the Victim,"  affirmative action, 
    stereotyping and the media, and "the Bell Curve."

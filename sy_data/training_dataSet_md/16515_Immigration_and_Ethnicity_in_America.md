    Our immigrant society has been described as a melting pot, a mosaic, a salad bowl, as well as other less attractive metaphors.  Through lectures, class discussions, readings, outside speakers and panels, films, and a community learning project, this course looks at various topics in immigration history, and explores how ethnicity and the city both played a role in the experiences of the immigrants and in the minds of those citizens who received them.

    The questions raised by this course have confused and divided scholars, politicians, journalists, and citizens.  I don't expect us to have any clearer answers, nor to agree with each other.  What I do expect is for us to go at these tough questions with energy and an open mind.  Therfore, I expect each of you to participate actively in class.  Present your ideas.  Speak your mind openly, and contribute towards the portion of your grade allotted to class participation (20 percent).  As participation is crucial, please come to class prepared.  More than two absences will affect your final grade.

    This course is also linked to the year-long "Migrations , Diasporic Communities and Transnational Identities" program.  Periodically we will be attending those events in place of regular class meetings.  Your attendance is required, as it is for regular classes.  If you cannot attend the session you must view the videotape of it before the next class meeting.  Because the symposium for the Diaspora series, March 12 and 13, is also required, we will meet for one fewer class periods, as noted on the syllabus.

    The course is divided thematically rather than chronologically or geographically.  We begin with Latino/a immigration as emblematic of the themes of the course: simultaneously many communities and one community, negotiating their place in the U.S. along lines of race, culture and nationality, and reshaping notions of identity in the process.  We turn then to the variety of interpretations of immigration, this time based on European immigration streams.  Finally, we will explore the problem of culture, assimilation and identity for immgrants, taking examples from Latino, European and Asian immgrant experiences.

    Please write an analytical review paper of no more than five pages on each of these themes.  Due dates are marked on the syllabus.  Your review must cover all the books in that themes as well as other relevant information from class.   Each analytical review essay should take up a significant issue raised in common by the books.  First lay out the issue you've chosen, and discuss how each book contributes to the discussion.  Place the books (and other class material, whether films, panels, lectures or discussions) in dialogue with each other.  Conclude with your assessment of the issue in question.  These essays must include both serious analysis and specific detail (rather than general observations) in support of it.   The first two papers cumulatively count for 30 percent of your final grade; the third theme is taken up by the final paper (see below).

    In order to assess the immigrant experience more directly, we will be hearing from faculty who have immigrated from a variety of countries and cultures at a variety of ages.  We will aslo be doing a community learning project in which each of you will be paired with a new immigrant.  Your obligation is to speak in English to this immigrant for approximately one to two hours a week and by the end of the course, create with that immigrant a way of telling his or her story.  You will be helping a new immigrant learn his or her new language, and giving voice to his or her experience.   In return, you will be learning about the immigration experience not from a theoretical or historical perspective, but rather as it is actually lived. 

    The T. A. and I will help pair you with an immigrant and facilitate transportation and other details.  Begin simply by getting to know this person.   You are there to help him or her learn English, so to speak simply and slowly as you guage your informat's ability to understand. Make arrangements to meet every week so there is continuity to the relationship.  Please keep a log of your visits.

    As the semester proceeds, try to learn what you can of the immigrant's experiences.  What made her leave?  What did she find when she arrived?  How has her experience been?  How has life changed from the old country to the new? What are her dreams for the future?  Keep notes on this in your log as you go.

    Over time you and your infomrant will get a sense of a particularly powerful or important story to tell.  Firure out - together - what story your informant wishes to tell, and how to do it.  It can be a written narrative with photographs, a short video, an oral history, or anything else you devise.  (The community learning office can make tape and video recorders available to you, or other supplies as needed.)  That project, due at the end of the semester, will be put on display at our end-of-semester celebration party for our class and our immigrant informants.  Come celebrate what we've accomplished!  The log, the project and your contributions to class discussions on your experiences will count towards 25 percent of your course grade.

    The final for this course is a paper on culture and identity worth 25 percent of your final grade.  Using the last thematice section of the course as the springboard, this paper should discuss the ways in which the experiences of immigration and the encounters immigrants have with Americans affect immigrants' sense of their identity.  What is the primary determiner of that identity, in your opinion?   Culture? Race? Nationality? Religion? Politics? Are there consistent patterns or does immigrant identity differ amonth different groups?  If there are differences, can they be attributed to time of arrival, reception by citizens, pattern of settlement, or some other external force?  Do generational divisions play out similarly or differently among these different immigrant communities?  You may consider any of these questions, or any others, but your focus must be on the experience of immigration and the factors contributing to ethnic identity among those immigrants.  Remember to use specific facts and examples, taken from the readings, class discussions, panels, the symposium, films, or the Migrations series, to provide concrete evidence for your claims.   Do not rely on generalities.  Thsi paper should be no longer than ten pages and is due at the time the registrar scheduled our final exam (which this paper replaces.)

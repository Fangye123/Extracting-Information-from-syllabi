This course will address the "modern" period of Japanese history, that is
since about 1600. The focus of the course will be on the rise and
establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the economic, social, and political
nature of the Tokugawa regime, the breakdown of this "Tokugawa synthesis"
under external pressures, the development of a new Japanese national ethic
that culminated in the Meiji restoration, the redefinition of Japanese society
in the Meiji and Taisho periods, the rise of Japan as an Asian and global
power, the definition and manifestation of a new aggressive nationalism, both
domestically and internationally, the growth of "fascist" politics in Japan,
the China War and Great Pacific War, the reformulation of Japan during the
American occupation, the economic miracle of late-Showa Japan, and the
political and economic prospects of the Heisei period, especially in the face
of growing "Japan Bashing" by the declining Western industrial powers.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

The requirements of the course are as follows:

  * _A Map Quiz_ \-- On Monday, 6 September, there will be an in-class map quiz, based on the study hints handed out in the first class. This will be a formal part of your grade and will count for 5%, but you will also be required to pass this quiz to get a grade in the course. If you do not pass on the first quiz, this grade will be the 5% of your grade and there will be later opportunities until you do pass. If you do not make a passing grade by the end of the semester, I'll turn in an "IF" for your grade and you will be able to resolve this missing map opportunity after the end of the semester! Passing is 65. 
  * _Reaction Paper 1_ \-- A three to five page reaction paper on Soseki, _Kokoro_ , due Monday, 27 September, 10% of the grade. 
  * _Reaction Paper 2_ \-- A three to five page reaction paper on Ishinomori, _Japan Inc._ , due Wednesday, 1 December, 10% of the grade. 
  * _Reaction Paper 3_ \-- A three to five page reaction paper on Kurosawa's film _Dreams_ , shown on Friday, 3 December, paper due Monday, 6 December, 10% of the grade. 
  * _Reading Report_ \-- A comparative five to seven page (?) reaction paper _cum_ book review of **_two_** of the books chosen from the selected listing of recommended books given below; things marked with an asterisk (*) are especially important. These books should make a topically linked pair. I cannot guarantee that these things are in Winthrop's library and have systematically excluded books in Japanese and European languages; check with me if you want an expanded bibliography. This report is due Monday, 6 December and is 18% of the grade. 
  * _Mid-Term Exam_ \-- An in-class exam, mainly essay, Wednesday, 20 October, 20% of the grade. 
  * _Final Exam_ \-- An in-class final exam, mainly essay, as scheduled for ????, 22% of the grade. 

Attendance policy: Winthrop University has an attendance policy. Unless stated
otherwise by the professor, the policy published in the catalogue prevails. I
have another policy. My policy is that you are all adults and have the right
to make decisions about your lives. I shall not take roll, but be informed
_and warned_ that you will miss classes at your very real peril!

All papers _must_ be typed, double-spaced, with ample margins for comments
(but, please, don't get silly about this last part!). I shall gladly (?) read,
review, comment on, and mark up preliminary drafts _if_ you get them to me
early. Any late papers will be accepted, but will be rigorously penalized at a
rate of five points (half a letter grade) per **_CALENDAR DAY_** that they are
late.

**A NOTE FOR HONORS STUDENTS AND GRADUATE STUDENTS:**  There are also a number
of students taking this course for in-class, "contracted," honors credit and
we have a few graduate students among us. Check with the instructor _at the
end of the first class meeting_ to obtain additional information pertaining to
your "special status."

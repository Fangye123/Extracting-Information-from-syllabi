### Course Requirements:

To receive credit for this course, a student must:

  1. Demonstrate appropriate understanding of the course content as manifest in performance on the examinations and written assignments as detailed under Grading Policies.
  2. Regularly attend laboratory sessions and demonstrate understanding of the laboratory content as manifest in performance on the laboratory assignments and exams as detailing under Grading Policies. 

### Required Textbooks:

Students are required to possess the following textbooks, lab manuals and
other materials:

### Grading Policy for Principles of Biology 241 (Fall 2000)

#### Grades in this class will be determined on a non-competitive basis. It is
possible for every student to earn an "A" grade.

The instructor will add the scores earned on the best four (4) of the five (5)
hourly exams (50 x 4 = 200 possible points), the scores earned on the
semifinal and final exams (100 x 2 = 200 points), all of the lecture quiz and
other scores (up to 100 points) and the best 10 of the possible laboratory
scores (5 points attendence + 5 points performance for each lab) plus the lab
final exam (50 points). The instructor reserves the right to raise or lower
the grade of any student up to 25 points based on the student's safety in the
lab, class participation, attendence, preparation or effort. Final grades will
be determined by evaluation of the total points earned by each student
according to the following schedule of grades.

  * Students earning 90% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "A". 
  * Students earning 80% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "B". 
  * Students earning 70% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "C". 
  * Students earning 60% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "D". 
  * Students earning less than 60% of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "F". 
Because only the best four of the five hourly exams will be counted, there
will be no makeup exams in this class. Because only the scores on the best 10
laboratories will be counted, there will be no makeup laboratories. All
students must take the lab final exam and both the semifinal and final lecture
exams to successfully complete this class. There will be no makeup quizzes or
assignments. The semifinal exam is scheduled for Wednesday the 1st of November
at 10:00 a.m. and the final exam will be given Wednesday, 13th of December
from 8:00 to 10:00 a.m.  
  
Cheating, whether seeking or giving inappropriate assistance during an exam,
quiz or other graded assignment will result in a score of "0" for both parties
involved. A second incident will result in a course grade of "F".

    ##   Reading & Writing Assignments  
    
     
    
    
    
    #### Directions:
    
    
    
    
    ##### You must critically summarize all reading assignments for the day they will be discussed. Each
    assignment is based on a packet of articles on an assigned topic. Everyone will read the same set of 
    articles as well as 2 sources to be acquired on one's own.  See guidelines below.
    
    Critical summaries are due on the date announced in class.  They must be typed, double-spaced, one
    inch margins, and at least 1400 words in length (at least 6-7 pages). You must include information from
    the assigned articles plus (at least) two extra sources. You must attach a bibliography and cite the
    sources as you use them. These assignments are essentially like mini-research papers. They should 
    include: an introductory statement about the main issue in the articles, a brief summary that includes the
    when/where/how and what of the material. Then you must present: 1) the various points of view on the
    issue (taking into account any biases in the source of the information). 2) the short-range and long-range 
    implications of the issue within the region and in global terms. 3) your position on the issue and why you
    think the way you do. You can cite other sources if necessary.

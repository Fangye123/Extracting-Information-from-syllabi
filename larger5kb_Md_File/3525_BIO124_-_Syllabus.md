**  
** Grades and Grading Policies

There will be a total of 550 points in the course. There are three written
exams (Exam 1 \- 160 pts; Exam 2 - 120 pts; Exam 3 - 50 pts), two WebCT
quizzes (each worth 20 pts), two laboratory quizzes (each worth 30 pts), a
final morphology exam (80 pts), and case study presentations (worth 40 pts
total).

The format for examinations will be different depending on the information
covered on the exam. Examples of types of questions which may occur on some of
the examinations include multiple-choice, matching, short answer, discussion,
problem-solving, morphology identification, and case study interpretation.
Make-up exams will be given only in the event of an illness or an emergency
and must be made-up within one week.

Students _must_ attend both Laboratories 1 _and_ 2\. There are no make-up
laboratories. Absence from one or more of the laboratories will result in a
Final Grade of "U" for the course.

Final Grades are determined using the following criteria:

|

**A**

|

Outstanding achievement

|

90% of total possible points  
  
---|---|---  
  
**B**

|

Excellent performance; clearly exceeds course requirements

|

80-89%  
  
**C**

|

Average

|

70-79%  
  
**D**

|

Passed, but not at average achievement standards

|

60-69%  
  
**F**

|

Failure to meet class requirements

|

less that 60%  
  


|

Plus and minus grades may be given at the discretion of the Instructors.  
  
Cheating Policy

Anyone who is caught cheating on any exam will be assigned a final grade of
**"** F **"** for the course. _No exceptions_ **.**

Add/Drop Policies

The add/drop policies for BIO 124 are the same as the University add/drop
policies. Students should refer to the CSUS Schedule of Classes for the
appropriate add/drop dates.

**  
** Technology Requirements

You should be comfortable using a computer and willing to browse the Internet.
This class requires online class participation on the Web assignments.
Students will need a SacLink account and computer access to the Web and WebCT.
All CSUS students enrolled in one or more units can create a
[SacLink](http://www.csus.edu/uccs/inetemail/SacLink/index.htm) account for
electronic mail and Internet services. If you do not already have a SacLink
account, please establish an account before the second class meeting. Although
a home computer with a high speed modem running Netscape or Internet Explorer
would be beneficial, students can access the Web from one of the [campus
student labs](http://www.csus.edu/uccs/labs/generalinfo/overview.htm). You are
not required to have a personal computer to enroll in this class. All
assignments are available on computers on campus. WebCT will run on older
machines but performance will be slow.

> Recommendations for hardware and web browsers include:

>

>> IBM/Intel machines: Windows compatible Pentium 3 running Windows 95/98 or
Windows NT with 32 MB RAM (preferably 64 MB), a sound card and speakers, and a
56K or faster modem (28.8 may be slow). DSL will download information more
quickly.

>>

>> Apple MacIntosh: PowerPC based machine, 32 MB RAM (preferable 64 MB), a
sound card and speakers, System 8, and a 56K or faster modem (28.8K may be
slow).

>>

>> Web Browsers: Netscape Navigator 4.0 or greater or Internet Explorer 4.01
or greater (older versions word unpredictably with WebCT)

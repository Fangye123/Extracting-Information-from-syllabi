**Introduction to Chinese Philosophy--The Foundations**

**Prerequisites** : At least one course in Philosophy is recommended. All
readings will be in English; no knowledge of Chinese is necessary.

**Course Description**

[Note: This is a course on Eastern philosophy. We will focus exclusively on
early Chinese thought this quarter. The content of Philosophy 435 may be
different in another quarter; the course may be repeated for credit in such a
case.]

In this course we will explore themes discussed by thinkers of the pivotal,
foundational period in Chinese intellectual history. The period begins and
flourishes during the gradual decline of the powerful Zhou Dynasty (ca. 1120
to 403 BC) amidst the political turmoil of feudalism. We will begin in the
Spring and Autumn period with Confucius (born 551 BC) and continue up until
the reunification of the various kingdoms under the rule of the Qin Dynasty
(221 BC).

The recorded conversations, poems, and sayings of the thinkers of this age
reflect responses to the political instability and personal hazards of the
times. But the responses of those thinkers often reveal an acute sensitivity
to human concerns which transcend the particularity of pre-Qin China. Hence,
one of the main goals of this course will be to engage in thinking about those
concerns along with the Chinese Ancients. The two concerns underlying most of
their discussions are: (1) the relationship between the ways humans actually
are and the best ways for them to be; and (2) the relationship between one's
personal, human point of view and the much grander point of view of the
universe. Our readings will focus for the most part on texts which explore
these two themes and we will grapple with these issues ourselves, by trying to
understand and assess the suggestions of the Ancients.

We will read selections from the major texts of what later came to be
classified as the three main schools of thought in pre-Qin China: the
Confucians, the Daoists, and the Mohists. The classification scheme is
difficult to justify in some cases and part of our task will be to locate
similarities and differences in view among the various texts.

Studying early Chinese philosophy requires patience and much interpretive
work. This is due to the non-systematic form of much of the material. Often,
apparent tensions or contradictions in a particular work demand careful
rethinking and a more nuanced reading of the text than at first glance, in
order to give a coherent overall interpretation. An important goal of this
course will be to avoid quick generalizations about particular figures or
schools and, instead, to be careful and sophisticated interpreters who have
textual support for their readings.

**Required Texts** :

1\. _Analects of Confucius_ , Simon Leys trans. (551-479 BC)  
2\. _Chuang Tzu_ , Burton Watson trans. (369-286? BC)  
3\. _Hsun Tzu_ , Watson trans. (298-238? BC)  
4\. _Lao Tzu: Tao Te Ching_ , Lau trans.(unclear who Lao Tzu was, if he
existed)  
5\. _Mencius_ , Lau trans. (372-289? BC)  
6\. _Mo Tzu_ , Watson trans. (ca. 479-438 BC)  
7\. _Intellectual Foundations of China_ , by Frederick W. Mote

In addition, copies of short selections from the following works will either
be handed out or compiled in a course pack for purchase--to be determined
based on enrollment, etc.

The _Mean_ (authorship uncertain)  
The _Great Learning_ (authorship uncertain)  
The _Han Fei Tzu_ (280?-233 BC)  
The _Gong Sun Lung Tzu_ (380-?)  
The Neo-Mohist writings (roughly contemporary with Mencius)

**Course Requirements**

Reading assignments will be given in class. The readings will tend to be
lengthy and will require patience. Trying to write brief summaries of the
readings will help. Indeed, such summaries will be required in all but the
readings in Mote's book. One page (at most) of summary per reading assignment
will be due on the day for which the reading is assigned. The one-page limit
is a _limit_ (one could write less) and is intended to force one to think
about how to give a pithy and clear accounting of a host of different sayings
and topics. In other words, it will force one to have a view--an
interpretation--of the reading. These summaries will be graded mainly for
clarity and minimal plausibility; random ones may also be chosen for
discussion in class. Late summaries will not be accepted.

A term paper (10-12 pages) is due on the day of the final exam. The paper will
involve giving an interpretation of the way that at least two of the major
figures differ in their treatment of a common topic. There will be no exams.

The final course grade will be calculated from the grades for the summaries
and the term paper, with the term paper counting for half and the summaries
combining for half.

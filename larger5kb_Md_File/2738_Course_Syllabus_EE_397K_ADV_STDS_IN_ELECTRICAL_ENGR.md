Prerequisites:  
  
Objectives: This is only the second time this class has been offered here at
UT-Austin. At this moment I am still adding to the class notes from last year.
The overall objective of this class is simple: what good are "micro-machines"?
We will begin with an overview of some of the processing techniques commonly
used for MEMS fabrication. These techniques are usually adapted from IC
processing: we will discuss basic materials, some mechanical properties, then
concentrate on deposition, lithography, and etch (wet and dry). We will then
discuss applications of MEMS technology to actuation and sensing. I will try
to use some "case studies" to investigate the utility of MEMS devices. We will
most likely look at temperature, pressure, acceleration, RF, optical, and
chemical applications.  
  
Class Projects: You must complete a class project, which will count for 40% of
your grade. The project will consist of the identification of a MEMS
device/system that is actually used in a commercial product, and a detailed,
critical examination of the product development history to identify why/if a
MEMS devices actually improved the performance of this system. You will then
prepare a written term paper on your findings (thoroughly referenced!!), as
well as giving a DETAILED oral presentation (about 20 minutes) to the class.
Before making your class presentation expect to spend at least two hours with
me, with a return visit to clarify any problems (and I guarantee I will find
something to object to) identified in your first meeting with me. Class
presentations will begin in early to mid-April.

Grades  
Your grades will be based upon performance on homework, exams, and the class
project. Homework will be assigned approximately weekly; credit for late
homework will be reduced at a rate of 10% per class the work is late.  
  
The weighting for different areas is:  
  
Homework 20%  
Midterm 20%  
Class project 40%  
Final 20%  
100%  
  
  
The worst-case grades will be based on:  
A 100-90% of total points available  
B 80-89%  
C 70-79%  
D 55-70%  
F 0-55%

adjustments for qualified students with disabilities. For more information,

LAST DAY TO DROP: 4TH DAY OF CLASSES (Jan. 17); BETWEEN THEN AND Feb. 11 MUST
HAVE GRAD ADVISOR'S CONSENT; AFTER Feb. 11 THERE MAY BE AN ACADEMIC PENALTY.
MARCH 25: LAST DAY TO CHANGE TO/FROM LETTER GRADE / CR / NC. After March 25
drops allowed only for extreme non-academic reasons. Notice of planned
absences for the observance of religious holy days must be submitted two weeks
in advance of the date of the absences. (See General Information, chapter 4,
for requirements [General Information, chapter
4](http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gi99-00/ch4/ch4f.html#add.drop).)  
  
Course Evaluation: University and optional in-house survey during last week of
class.  
  
Policy on CHEATING:  
You are expected to do your own work at ALL times. I expect you will often
discuss assignments, but you MUST do your own ORIGINAL written work. Any
evidence of cheating or plagiarism* will be treated as grounds for FAILURE in
the class.

*"A CASE OF PLAGIARISM  
"May is a second-year graduate student preparing the written portion of her
qualifying exam. She incorporates whole sentences and paragraphs verbatim from
several published papers. She does not use quotation marks, but the sources
are suggested by statements like '(see . . . for more details).' The faculty
on the qualifying exam committee note inconsistencies in the writing styles of
different paragraphs of the text and check the sources, uncovering May's
plagiarism.  
"After discussion with the faculty, May's plagiarism is brought to the
attention of the dean of the graduate school, whose responsibility it is to
review such incidents. The graduate school regulations state that 'plagiarism,
that is, the failure in a dissertation, essay, or other written exercise to
acknowledge ideas, research or language taken from others' is specifically
prohibited. The dean expels May from the program with the stipulation that she
can reapply for the next academic year." [ URL: [
http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/misconduct.html#Plagiarism](http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/obas/contents/misconduct.html#Plagiarism)]  
  
"A broad spectrum of misconduct falls into the category of plagiarism, ranging
from obvious theft to uncredited paraphrasing that some might not consider
dishonest at all. In a lifetime of reading, theorizing, and experimenting, a
person's work will inevitably incorporate and overlap with that of others.
However, occasional overlap is one thing; systematic use of the techniques,
data, words, or ideas of others without appropriate acknowledgment is
another." [ URL: [

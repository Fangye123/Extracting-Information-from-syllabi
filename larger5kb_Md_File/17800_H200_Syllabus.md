##  G200 - WORLD REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY  (Honors Section)

**Spring 2002**

You completed your homework on a computer made in South Korea using software
written in India.  You sent a letter to your brother stationed in Saudi Arabia
and went out for dinner at an Ethiopian restaurant.  On the way home you
stopped for a newspaper at a local package store run by a nice family of
Brazilian immigrants.  The front-page stories say that CO2 emissions in
England might cause flooding in Guam, that currency devaluation in the
Philippines might mean cheaper clothes in Columbus, and that the 6 Billionth
person was born recently in India.  You sit down for Nicaraguan coffee on your
couch made in Sweden and drift to sleep dreaming of a beach in Australia.
You've had a **_very global day_** but you are now very much confused.  What
do all of these places have to do with one another?  What's going on here that
they are so much a part of your daily life?  Where is Guam, anyway?!

This class will introduce the trends in population, development, and
environment that are occurring in all of these places.  Moreover, it will
present methods and concepts to help you trace and explain the global and
regional processes that drive changes around the world today.  By the end of
the course, you will be familiar with these methods, concepts, and techniques
and you will have a good basic grounding in major trends in the regions of the
world.  Finally, you will have mastered some basic information about these
regions and will be able to locate the important physical and human features
of each.  More to the point, you will have digested the course's central
theme: **_that differences between regions and places in the world are created
by the very forces that tie those places to one another._**

###  Requirements

* While attendance will not be taken, it is expected that you will show up for class.  Much of the exam material will be based on lecture material and ideas raised in classroom discussion.
* You are expected to read. In addition to the textbook, there will be occasional readings (no more than an article a week). These, too, will serve as the basis of classroom discussion and examination material. Keep up and this will be easy; wait until the night before the exam and it will be difficult.
* A portion of your grade (around 16%) will be based on **participation in discussion.**   Student groups will be responsible for various regions and will be expected keep the rest of the class up-to-date on a region's current events, using and presenting newspaper stories every Friday. (Look [here](CEsources.html) for some sources.)
* **Four lab assignments**. These assignments will have a hard and fixed due date. _No late assignments. No exceptions._
* **Three exams.** These exams will have simple short-answer and "objective" (multiple choice) components but will, owing to the "honors" status of the course, also include some longer short essay style questions. Clarity of expression is a factor in assessing these exams.
* **Seven quick map quizzes.** The items (physical, social, and political locations) to be located will be identified on an assignment sheet (handed out with practice maps) available at least a week in advance of the quiz date. To prepare for these, use your atlas to locate these places on the practice maps and study the sheet. Group work and study is encouraged here.
* This course will be fun, though you _are not required to have fun._ We'll try to provide a flavor for the places we are studying with music, slides, and even food from time to time. You will do best to remain armed with curiosity and enthusiasm for the world.

###  Grading Policy

The final grade is based on the proportion of cumulative points you have
earned over the semester. Think of every exam or assignment as an opportunity
to earn points...There are a **total of 620 points** , divided over the
following:  
  Short Assignments | 25 points each |  x |  5 = |  125 points  
---|---|---|---|---  
Participation | 100 total points |  x |  1 = |  100 points  
Map Quizzes | 10 points each |  x |  7 = |   70 points  
Exams | 100 points each |  x |  2 = |  200 points  
Final Exam | 125 total points |  x |  1 = |  125 points

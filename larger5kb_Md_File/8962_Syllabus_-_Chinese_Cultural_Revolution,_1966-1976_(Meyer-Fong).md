The Cultural Revolution was Mao Zedong's last attempt to transform Chinese
society spiritually and structurally. The events of this period were marked by
social upheaval, personal vendettas, violence, massive youth movements, and
extreme ideological pressure. What were the causes of the Cultural Revolution?
How was it experienced and how is it remembered? To what extent are its
reverberations felt in contemporary Chinese society, politics, and literature?
How have subsequent events effected our understanding of the Cultural
Revolution decade? This course will explore the Cultural Revolution from a
variety of perspectives, focusing on the relationship between events in China
from 1966-1976, and their interpretation in China and the West during the
Cultural Revolution decade and since.

**Course Requirements:**

** This course will combine elements of lecture and in-class discussion. Class
attendance is expected and participation will be counted in calculating the
final grades. Reading and viewing assignments should be completed before each
session, and active participation will contribute substantially to the final
grade.

**Grades will be calculated as follows:

Participation: 10%  
Map Quiz (9/20): 5%  
Midterm (10/30): 15%

Take Home Final Examination (due in class 12/11): 30%

**No extensions will be granted without prior permission of the instructor.
Papers submitted late without permission of the instructor will be penalized
by half a grade per day. An "A" paper submitted one day after the deadline
will receive an "A-". If there is an unavoidable absence for the midterm
examination, this should be cleared with the instructor before the
examination, or if this is not physically possible, as soon thereafter as is
feasible. Otherwise, students will receive a grade of "zero" for the exam.

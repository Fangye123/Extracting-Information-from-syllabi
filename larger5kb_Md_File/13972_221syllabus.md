**Women in Modern Europe**

This course is designed to examine women's roles in modern European history
and to discover how concepts of gender have affected our understanding of
Europe's past and influenced the fates of European women. Although we begin by
looking at women in pre-industrial Europe, our focus will be the ways science,
industrialization, and urbanization contributed to the transformation of
European society.

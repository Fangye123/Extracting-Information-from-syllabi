LarsonOffice: 102 History CornerTelephone: 723-9179 (Answering machine)E-mail: betafo@lelandOffice Hours: Monday, 10-11, or by appointment.Meeting Place: 201 History CornerMeeting Time: Tuesday 2:15-4:05 This colloquium is an exploration of the elusive concept-yet powerful reality-ofethnicity. It is an enquiry into how historians of Africa have written ofethnicity and ethnic identity. Ethnicity is a social reality which we experienceand about which we read on nearly a daily basis. A social reality of greatpower (emotional, political, military), ethnicity is a paramountly slippery,unwieldy concept to define with precision. One way to understand the conceptis to explore how authors have employed and discussed it in their writing.Because this is the method we will employ, this course emphasizes the fundamentalhistorical skills of reading, writing, analyzing and speaking. Course participantsare expected to read the assigned readings for each week in full, to commenton them orally in the class, and to analyze them through two written essays.You are encouraged to read carefully and critically; the emphasis in bothreading and writing for this course is upon quality rather than quantity. Because this course is a colloquium in historiography, we will concentrateprimarily upon what has been explicitly written about ethnicity in Africanhistory (especially since 1980), rather than upon works not explicitly aboutethnicity but which might be useful for understanding it. Because of therestrictions of time and the fact that a course on ethnicity in South Africawas taught at Stanford during Fall quarter 1993, this course will not incorporatethe increasingly rich debates about ethnicity in South Africa. Our focusis primarily upon eastern and central Africa, reflecting the instructor'sown expertise and the fact that most work on ethnicity since 1980 has focusedon the area south of the equatorial forest. The study of ethnicity in Africa is undergoing a renaissance. In ten yearsthere is likely to be a great deal written on the topic. Because of theinfancy of the study of ethnicity in the mid-1990s, there is a definitelack of balance and comprehensiveness in the field of African studies ofethnicity, especially as regards the relationship of ethnicity to otherimportant historical concepts such as gender, class, sexuality, nationalism,historical consciousness. A primary purpose of this course is to identifystrengths and weaknesses in the literature and to search for ways to advanceresearch on ethnicity in African history. Homework Requirements: Two essays, and a list of personal issues for discussiondrawn up for each class. Personal Issue Lists: Personal issue lists are entirely informal. As youread the material for the upcoming week's session, jot down ideas whichyou would like to explore and questions which you would like to raise aboutthe reading. These can include strong agreement, disagreements, interestingideas, how various works relate to each other, defects in arguments, observationsabout the use of evidence, missing evidence, what the author could havedone better, etc. They should be questions for reflection and discussionraised for the entire class, not questions for me as the facilitator (youcan ask me those directly). For each meeting you must draw up a list ofnumbered issues for discussion, make a copy of them, and submit the copy(one page is sufficient) to me at the BEGINNING of class as you come in.Do not submit a list if you do not attend class. Your copy of the list willserve as a basis for your participation in the session. The copy you provideme will demonstrate to me that you have read and reflected on the assignedmaterial. If you cannot attend class (not recommended!), make arrangementswith me to provide a personal issue list before the weekly session. Essay One: The first paper is an exercise in definition and a short criticalhistoriographical essay. Using the readings assigned for the class and theclass discussion (especially for the January 11 session), write an essaywhich defines ethnicity and explores the various ways in which scholarsgenerally (not necessarily Africanists) have understood and researched itas a concept. The paper should be an essay which is both a review of theliterature (from the January 11 session) and a demonstration of your personalunderstanding of ethnicity and ethnic identity. There are no "correct"answers. In working through your own definition/understanding of ethnicity,you must explicitly state how the concepts of "consciousness,""identity," "ethnic identity," and "ethnic group,"relate to it. You must also identify other possible human identities, andhow they differ from an ethnic identity. In reviewing the approaches whichscholars have employed in writing about ethnicity, you should evaluate boththe strengths and weaknesses of each approach and provide your own suggestionsfor how to better understand, conceptualize, and research ethnicity. Inwriting this essay you are strongly encouraged NOT to read beyond materiallisted in this syllabus, but you may draw upon outside material if it isdirectly relevant to your argument. Do not submit a paper longer than twelvepages: the emphasis is on quality, not quantity. The paper is due in classon February 1. Your efforts will be taken seriously and must benefit allclass participants: you must come to class with sufficient copies of yourpaper to distribute to all your fellow classmates. Essay Two: The second paper, along with a copy for each class participant,is due in the History Department box for "History 249C/349C" (justto your right, near the floor, as you enter the history department by themain door) by 5pm on Tuesday, March 15. The second paper is a critical historiographicalessay reviewing the approaches employed by Africanist historians to understandethnicity in African history. Again, you are encouraged not to conduct researchbeyond careful readings and re-readings of the materials listed in thissyllabus. The essay should demonstrate that you understand the central argumentsand approaches of the historians whose work we read. As an historiographicalreview, the paper should discuss strengths and weaknesses in the variousapproaches and in the books and articles we read. You do not have to mentionor footnote each piece we read; rather, you should demonstrate that youunderstand the range of ways in which Africanists have written about ethnicityin African history and in so doing explicitly mention most of what we read.Well argued essays will include criticisms of the material we read as wellas suggestions for improving scholarship on African ethnicity. Be courageous,make bold arguments, and defend them with sound evidence. Strive for organization,clarity, brevity and-understandability! Essays should be at least ten butno more than fifteen pages long. To help you write both essays, I urge you to take copious notes when youread and to pay careful attention to the arguments and ideas of your colleaguesin class as we discuss the readings (and note those too). Taken during thelength of the course, your notes will constitute an invaluable resourcefor writing excellent essays. There are no additional requirements for graduate students taking this course;I expect that your seniority will be reflected in the quality of your work. Grading:First Essay: 30%Second Essay: 30%Class Attendance and Participation: 20%Personal Issue Lists: 20% Required Texts available at Stanford BookstoreSteven Feierman, Peasant Intellectuals: Anthropology and History in Tanzania(Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1990).Thomas Spear & Richard Waller (eds.)

**TWENTIETH-CENTURY GLOBAL REVOLUTIONS**  
**311-27300-01**

**Introduction**

Twentieth century revolutions created a complex and dynamic global community
into the twenty first century. A revolutionary transformation in western
everyday life and values in response to the insecurities of industrialization
and a scientific "modernization" process initiated a reconceptualization of
traditional cultural values and worldviews. Political, scientific,
philosophical, economic, social and cultural thoughts and conditions changed
rapidly. Europeans provided idealistic revolutionary solutions to these
complex transitions and tensions. Those who followed the Eighteenth and
Nineteenth century ideologies of Liberalism/Capitalism, Nationalism, Marxism
and their offshoots attempted to create and apply utopian models in the
socially and culturally diverse world of the twentieth century. Political/
ideological revolutions inevitably had to deal with global cultural realities
and the outcomes were far from ideal.

Revolutions are not strictly political and ideological in nature. Revolutions
of this century became revolutionary struggles to culturally transform the
values and everyday life of global multicultural societies to fit European
utopian ideological parameters. In actual revolutionary practice, conflicting
cultural values of unique global societies became the base of revolutionary
activity. Current and future global revolutions will involve expanded
perceptions of cultural tension that go beyond state boundaries.

This course will offer a comprehensive survey of twentieth century global
revolutions. We shall first analyze the underlying causes, theories and models
of revolutions. We shall then evaluate specific revolutions and revolutionary
movements. European conditions and activities will be examined with special
emphasis placed upon the Russian/Soviet revolutions. The Chinese Revolution
will be evaluated within the context of a western revolutionary model
implemented and modified by a non-western people, with special emphasis placed
upon evaluating the Chinese Cultural Revolution. The post World War Two period
introduced a global revolutionary movement of decolonization. India's Gandhi
proposed a unique, non-violent path of civil disobedience, which many view
revolutionary. We shall evaluate Gandhi's model and judge its implementation
in the United States by Martin Luther King.

Revolutions occurred with greater frequency in the latter half of the
twentieth century. We shall begin with an overview of conditions on the
African continent and then specifically appraise revolutionary conditions in
Nigeria and South Africa followed by Latin American revolutions in Cuba and
elsewhere. The Middle East (or South West Asia) provides examples of new
revolutionary cultural formations and directions based upon traditional
values. We shall appraise the most recent revolutions in Eastern and Central
Europe and evaluate current and future revolutionary trends and movements that
transcend state borders but are culturally based: music, popular culture,
gender relations, consumerism, spirituality, the media and new technologies.

**Requirements**

1\. Regular attendance is expected of all students. College policy allows only
three un-excused absences. Absences will adversely affect the comprehension of
course material and one's grade. Students are expected to have read the
assigned readings and participate in class discussion. **Please remember that
attendance and class participation** **influence your grade!**

2\. Each student will complete two interpretive essay examinations and a final
comprehensive examination. The essays are conceptual in nature and test the
students' comprehension and analysis of the material covered in class and the
readings. Make up examinations for those with a valid excuse will be given at
the professor's convenience.

3\. Book critiques are another component of course requirements. Students must
complete two critiques. Three critiques may be turned in and the best two
calculated into the final grade, or students may turn in only two critiques
all of which will be calculated. The following authors will be critiqued: The
first a choice of either Scott or Zhenhua, the second, Kapuscinski or
Huntington. Due dates are listed in the Topics and Assignments section of the
syllabus. The following book critique guidelines will be followed.

The **book critique** will consist of four sections:

> **a**. Introduction: Introduce the author's main thesis and themes. Include
a brief summary of what the critique will specifically examine.  
> **b**. Provide a brief historical, geographical background and setting.  
> **c**. Select three or more main themes and events you have analyzed as
being most significant and support them with specific examples.  
> **d**. Provide a critique of the work's strong and weak historical and
stylistic points. Decide how the book relates to the Global Revolutions course
and recommend an appropriate readership.

4\. Videos reinforce materials covered in class and should be appropriately
analyzed.

5\. Cooperative learning project. The course of the Chinese Cultural
Revolution is assessed by group presentations and Maoist critiques of _Red
Flower of China._ Appointed student communes will accomplish this task with
the appropriate revolutionary zeal. A concise communal written report will
also be required. More specific instructions will be forthcoming.

6\. The writing of essays, critiques and papers follows specific criteria and
all sources must be properly documented. Carefully read the sections of the
hard copy syllabus dealing with plagiarism and writing papers. _A Student's
Guide to History_ offers excellent information in this area.

    (WHIM)
    
    
    COURSE BENEFITS
    - Study and develop emerging technologies that can potentially aid 
    information consumers and knowledge workers to efficiently cull out
    Web materials most relevant to the project or task at hand, to use 
    it productively.
    - Study and develop new information management and Internet-scale 
    computation capabilities that can potentially enable information 
    producers and e-commerce participants to economically achieve their 
    goals.

    APPLICABLE DEGREE PROGRAMS
    - Although this is a graduate-level Computer Science course, 
    advanced undergraduates and non-majors are very welcome.  
    - Technically-oriented students with background/experience 
    equivalent to B+ or higher in [COMS W3156 Introduction to Software 
    Engineering](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kaiser/cs3156/) and/or any COMS W41xx course should register normally 
    for E6998 section 01.  E6998 requires a substantial software 
    development project; students may work alone or in self-organized 
    groups (2-5 recommended).
    - Non-technical students should obtain permission from the 
    instructor to register for 3 points of COMS W3998 (undergraduates) 
    or COMS W4901 (graduate students), section 014 in either case,

    Description: Emerging methods of information sharing, analysis and 
    manipulation that can help people work alone or together over the 
    Web over a variety of domains, including but not limited to 
    education, healthcare, commerce, software engineering and 
    engineering design, even disaster relief. Topics may include 
    workflow management, enterprise organization, multi-user domain 
    (MUD), object-oriented database, distributed computing and other 
    technologies can be applied to and expanded for the Web; improved 
    methods for deploying, searching and gathering human, computational 
    and data resources over the Internet; and upcoming changes to the 
    HTTP and XML standards and related software development 
    infrastructure such as Java.
    
    
    Required Text(s): Web documents, see [Readings](readings.htm).
    
    
    Reference Text(s): Java, HTTP, XML, etc. specifications 
    available on Web, see [Interesting Websites](websites.html).
    
    
    Homework(s): The course will be taught in seminar style; class 
    attendance and participation is _required_.  Due to large class size,
    participation will be graded on a "virtual" basis.  In particular,
    _all_ students must submit weekly detailed commentaries relevant to 
    the latest lecture and corresponding readings, and participate 
    actively in the on-line class discussions. The weekly essays are due 
    no later than the **Tuesday 11am** following each Thursday class period, 
    starting for CVN students with the second class on September 14th and 
    for all other students (both technical and non-technical options)
    with the third class on September 21st.
    
    
    Project(s): Individual or self-organized group (except see 
    W3998/W4901 option). Possibilities will be suggested (see
    [Suggested Projects](projects.html)) and students may propose their own -
    in which case please email a brief synopsis to the [instructor](mailto:kaiser@cs.columbia.edu) 
    ASAP, do **not** wait until the formal proposal deadline!
     Demos required.
    CVN student projects must be runnable over Web (e.g., browser applet) 
    or trivial to download/install/run on Windows 2000 or Linux.
    
    
    Paper(s): Project proposal, design, and final report (except see 
    W3998/W4901 option).
    
    
    Presentation(s): Due to large class size, it will not be possible
    to schedule live presentations during class time.  All students 
    must therefore post Web presentations with corresponding text 
    (or audio) "speech", of approximately 5 minutes total length.
    
    
    Midterm Exam(s): One, take home, open book, open notes, 
    submit to instructor [by email](mailto:kaiser@cs.columbia.edu). 
    
    
    Final Exam(s): Cancelled.
    
    
    Grading: Originally homework 10%, project/papers 50%, presentation 10%, 
    exams 30%. Revised to homework 10%, project/papers 60%, presentation 10%, 
    exam 20%.
    
    
    Hardware Requirements: Windows/MacOS/Unix computer with Internet 
    access. Microphone and speakers recommended.
    
    
    Software Requirements: Email, publicly available personal 
    "home page", Web browser, Acrobat Reader, Powerpoint Viewer,
    word processing, all software development facilities needed 
    for project (Java 1.3 recommended). 
    
    
    Assignment Submission: Upload to [WHIM bscw server](http://whim.cs.columbia.edu/bscw.htm) ([general BSCW info](http://bscw.gmd.de/)).
    Assignments must be submitted in plain ascii, html, pdf, 
    postscript, MS Powerpoint or MS Word format. All assignments
    except the midterm exam **must** be submitted online, 
    do **not** submit paper.

    **Special option for non-technical (social sciences, 
    humanities, arts, etc.) students:** 
    Obtain permission from instructor to register for 3 points of 
    COMS W3998 (undergraduates) or COMS W4901 (graduate students), 
    section 014 in either case (it is very important to register 
    for the proper section number!). Familiarity with Web browsing 
    and basic Web page construction/maintenance required. 
    Such non-technical students will usually conduct background research,
    policy/impact analysis and/or  "user studies" - usually in cooperation 
    with technical projects.  
    Term paper proposal, detailed outline, demo narration and 
    final term paper required in lieu of regular programming project 
    and corresponding documentation.
    Non-technical students are "allowed" to conduct or fully participate 
    in technical projects instead of the term paper, if they so choose, 
    but are not required to do so.
    However: homework (class attendance/participation with weekly
    essays), presentation and exams **are** still required for all students.  
    Instructor may apply different grading criteria and curving scales 
    for 6998 vs. 4901 vs. 3998.

****_Course Description_.** ** The course provides an introduction to the
concepts and methods of Marxist economics. Part One of the course introduces
some of the basic ideas of Marxist analysis and briefly considers these ideas
in relation to the broad evolution of modern economic history. Part Two
focuses on central aspects of Marxist theory (e.g., value and surplus value,
the accumulation process), and Part Three develops the material through
application to particular historical and current problems (e.g., income
inequality, racism, environmental degradation). A short final part of the
course, Part Four, deals with Marxism and socialism. Several themes and
concepts run through the course; these include the processes of alienation and
exploitation, the operation of contradictions and the role of dialectics, and
the interaction between social struggle and economic change.

**** Requirements. Grades for the course will be based on two papers and two
exams. One exam will be an in-class exam; the other will be given during the
final exam period at the end of the term. The exam and assignment due dates
and weights in determining grades are as follows:

**Regular attendance is expected.** . In my experience, a student who does not
attend regularly cannot do well, or even reasonably, in the course. On exams,
you will be responsible for material presented in class as well as for
material from the readings; also, I will expect your papers to build upon the
class discussions as well as upon the readings. Attendance is, however, your
responsibility. I will not keep track of attendance, though I will take
attendance for awhile to get to know your names.

In general, it is my policy to penalize late papers, not to allow any absences
from exams, and to give  
no incompletes. I do make exceptions -- for example, if you are in the
hospital.

**Readings.** I urge you to buy the books below (available in the bookstore).
All or substantial parts of  
each will be required reading:

> > Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, The Communist Manifesto  
>  Karl Marx, Wage Labor and Capital  
>  Harry Braverman, Labor and Monopoly Capital

Also, several readings, especially in Part Three, are from _Dollars & Sense_
magazine and other sources. You should read most items at least twice, once
before the related class discussion and once later. You will get much more out
of this course if you keep well ahead in the readings.

**Office Hours.** I realize that students often cannot come to my scheduled
office hours. I am, however, available at many other times. If you wish to see
me at some other time, we can make an appointment; simply ask me at class,
call me on the phone, or send me an e-mail message.

**Goals.** The purpose of this course is to provide a general introduction to
Marxist economics and to demonstrate how Marxist economics can provide a way
of understanding several current social issues. By focusing on this
"alternative approach" to economic issues, the course should also give
students a better understanding of approaches to economic issues that they
have studied in other courses. In addition, Economics 210 works toward several
of the broad goals that shape the curriculum of the Department of Economics. A
statement of these goals is available on the Department's web site:
www.cas.umb.edu/econ.html (or ask for a copy). Of the goals, the ones most
directly relevant to Economics 210 are: 1, 2f, 3, 6, 7, 8, and 12.

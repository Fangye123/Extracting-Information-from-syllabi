  * Humanities 1 - _Introduction to the Humanities: American Isms: Art, Music and Literature_ (Fall). [Co-taught with [Prof. Jeff Groves](http://www2.hmc.edu/~groves/).]  
Humanities 1 is an introduction to college level studies in the humanities and
social sciences focusing on the development of essential reading, critical
thinking, research, and writing skills. _American Isms_ traces the fascinating
interrelationships that bridge American art, music, and literature through
both familiar artists (Dickinson, Whitman, Whistler, Copland) and less
familiar ones (Tuckerman, Bierstadt, Harrison). We will also cover a wide
variety of aesthetic forms: from romantic lyric to free-verse poem; from
landscape painting to landscape cinema; from transcendental essay to modernist
novel; from the symphony to the rock opera. In addition to reading
assignments, students in this section will also have weekly listening
assignments, though no previous musical experience is required.

  * Humanities 2 - _Introduction to the Humanities: Music and the Arts in the Twentieth Century_ (Spring).  
Humanities 2 is a continuation of the methods and skills taught in Humanities
1, which is an introduction to college level studies in the humanities and
social sciences focusing on the development of essential reading, critical
thinking, research, and writing skills. _Music and the Arts in the Twentieth
Century_ looks at several of the most important trends in twentieth-century
music and the ways in which they are mirrored by contemporary trends in
literature, the visual arts, and society. Readings include sources in the
artists' own words as well as secondary criticism and analysis. No previous
knowledge of music is required or expected, though some regular listening will
be a part of the course.

available. While this course will not concentrate on MIDI instruments, their
integration with computer-generated sound files will be explored. A background
in computers is helpful, but not required. The artistic applications of
computer music technologies will also be discussed, and, while a background in
music will be helpful for this, it is also not required. Most of the
coursework will consist of short hands-on projects as well as a major final
project. The final project is generally a computer music composition or
realization, but other possibilities will be offered for those students who do
not feel comfortable composing. Enrollment limited to 25.

Research Interests  
  

Michael Burawoy has studied industrial workplaces in different parts of the
world -- Zambia, Chicago, Hungary and Russia -- through participant
observation. In his different projects he has tried to cast light -- from the
standpoint of the workplace -- on the nature of postcolonialism, on the
organization of consent to capitalism, on the peculiar forms of working class
consciousness and work organization in state socialism, and finally on the
dilemmas of transition from socialism to capitalism. Most recently he has been
studying the peculiar form of capitalism that has arisen in Russia: how the
economy has been driven by the expansion of a range of intermediary
organizations operating in the sphere of exchange (trade, finance, barter, new
forms of money), and how the productive economy has been recentered on
households and especially women. He refers to these processes of decline as
"involution". He has developed theoretically driven methodologies that allow
him to draw broad conclusions from his ethnographic research and case studies.
Thus, most recently he coauthored a book with 9 graduate students on "Global
Ethnography," that showed how globalization can be studied "from below"
through participation in the lives of those who experience it. Throughout his
sociological career he has engaged with Marxism, seeking to reconstruct it in
the light of his research and more broadly in the light of historical
challenges of the late 20th century.

**Unofficial Course Description:**  

> Comparative Vertebrate Anatomy studies the anatomical and physiological
adaptations of vertebrates from an evolutionary perspective using lectures,
student-led discussions, and laboratory exercises.  The entire spectrum of
vertebrate diversity is studied from the first known fossil vertebrates
through all living clades and including virtually all known extinct clades of
vertebrates throughout their 455 million year history.  Vertebrate anatomical
and physiological systems are also examined from in an evolutionary context;
utilizing the principles of cladistic analysis, each system is examined from
its most primitive vertebrate condition to the many unique derived conditions
found among living and/or fossil vertebrates with particular emphasis placed
on selection pressures and the relationship between molecular, microscopic or
macroscopic morphology and function.  As a consequence, this course also
includes the study of evolutionary theory, phylogenetic systematics, history,
and basic physics.  The course will include the use of dissection and other
laboratory techniques to study vertebrate functional morphology.

**Teaching Philosophy:**  

> This course concerns itself with the functional anatomical adaptations that
can be found among the worlds extant (living) and extinct (not living)
vertebrates.  The material lends itself to a hands-on and explorative learning
style in order to facilitate comprehension of the diverse and complicated
principles in this highly active discipline.  Students can expect to
participate in primary data collection and statistical analysis, dissections,
computer modeling, and a variety of work with vertebrate specimens in all
states of preparation.  As all vertebrates are products of an unique
evolutionary history, a thorough understanding of the evolutionary history and
phylogenetic systematics of the groups studied will be crucial.  Consequently,
students will be introduced to the study of phylogeny and its relevance to
form (morphology), function (biomechanics & physiology), behavior (positional
and interactive), and ecology (current state as well as evolutionary).
Students will work independently on occasion, though group work will be
emphasized.  Additional work may be demonstration-based, and significant
discussion is expected.  There will be little lecturing in this course.
Instead, this course will consist largely of student-centered discussion-
driven meetings around previously assigned readings and
experimental/analytical work.  Students are expected to complete relevant
readings as assigned prior to attendance of a class on that subject.

**Grading Policy:**  

> Grades are based on a combination of exam performance, group projects, day-
to-day participation, quizzes, and laboratory performance.  
>

> > **EXAMS:   **There will be three multi-format, time-limited examinations
worth 100 points each.  There will be no opportunities to make-up missed exams
except as mandated by university policies (examples of acceptable exceptions
include a death in the family, severe illness, etc.).  Exams make-up 50% of
the total course grade.  
>  **JOURNAL CLUB:  ** Journal club assignments are worth 20% of the course
grade.  Details of the journal club assignments are available on a separate
handout.  
>  **ASSIGNMENTS & LABORATORY: ** Laboratory work will include completion of
various laboratory assignments made throughout the semester, and individual
laboratory assignments are variable in value.  Laboratory time is tightly
constrained, hence it is your responsibility to utilize your time wisely.  Lab
assignments and activities will be worth 20% of the course grade.  
>  **PARTICIPATION:   **All students are expected to participate (minimally)
on a daily basis in group discussions, laboratory work, and general class
activities.  Participation over the semester is worth 5% of the course grade.
Note that assignment of participation grades is somewhat qualitative, though
occasional quantitative sampling of participation may be made.  
>  **QUIZZES:  ** Quizzes will be variable in frequency and value.  Quizzes
may be announced or unannounced.  There will be no opportunities to make-up
missed pop-quizzes.  Quizzes will be worth 5% of the course grade.  
>

> **CURVES** **-** Note that this course, as well as all exams and
assignments, will not be graded on a curve of any kind.

> **Grading Scale:**

**A**     =    100    -    91.0  
**AB**     =    90.9    -    88.0  
**B**     =    87.9    -    81.0  
**BC**     =    80.9    -    78.0

**Additional Information & Special Concerns: **  

> **Exams:**  
>

>

>> Please note that while exams will tend to be topical, sub-disciplines of
evolutionary biology interrelate markedly.  Consequently, success in exams and
projects directly depends on performance in previous portions of the course.
For this reason, all exams, and even topics of discussion, can be expected to
be of a cumulative nature.  
>

>

> **Dissection:  **  
>

>

>> This course includes dissection of vertebrates.  Students who have any
concerns regarding the use of vertebrate animals in this course (living or
dead) which they believe may prevent them from participating fully in this
course must contact the instructor within the first full week of class to
discuss the reason(s) for the concern and possible alternatives.  Failure to
discuss these issues with your instructor within the first week of the course
constitutes an agreement to participate fully in dissection and other
laboratory activities involving vertebrate animals.  
>

>

> **Technology (e-mail & the Internet!):**  
>

>

>> The instructor may utilize e-mail and the internet for information
dissemination in this course.  All students are responsible for checking their
e-mail regularly and utilizing these technologies in communicating with the
instructor and other students when appropriate.  Students with concerns about
using these technologies should contact the instructor as early in the course
as possible.

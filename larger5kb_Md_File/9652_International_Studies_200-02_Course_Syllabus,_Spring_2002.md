In this course we will try to understand how indigenous people and the
Europeans involved thought about their early encounters with one another. In
order to do this we will read primary sources such as Columbus's diary and
early Aztec and Spanish accounts of the Spanish conquest. We will also examine
how different historians have tried to say about encounters between Europeans
and indigenous people. Come on a historical voyage as we go to Medieval
Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, Africa, and the Pacific.

_Your presence, contribution to discussions, thoughtful reading, and notes on
the reading are essential for the class to be a rewarding experience. This
class involves lots of reading and advance planning. Please make sure that you
are able to meet all requirements if you choose to take the class._

This course has a Blackboard web page. The address is
[http://courses.denison.edu](http://courses.denison.edu.). Log on with your
email name and password and you can access the class. The site contains
information from this syllabus. I will post announcements and other
information when necessary. Please make sure you read the Blackboard page
regularly to keep up with discussion assignments and other issues.

**Electronic Reserves: Eres**

Many of the articles are on Eres. I state in the syllabus when a reading is to
be found on Eres.  
Go to the library home page and then to Course Reserves. Go to Eres and either
look up under my name, Scully, or the name of the course. The password is
Aztec. Once you get to the class click on each article in order to read it.  
Please note:

Some articles say part 1 and part 2 etc. This is just because Eres works best
if articles are put up in short pieces. Please read all parts of an article.

¡¤ Some articles might need to be turned around to face the right way. Use the
little button that has a little page image next to it at the top right of the
screen.

¡¤ You should print out the articles. This makes for much better reading and
taking of notes.

¡¤ **Evaluation**

Class Participation: **20%**  
          This is evaluated through your oral participation, in-class assignments, and your ability to discuss  
          readings with insight and evidence of having done close reading of the texts. You are expected to be  
          in every class. Note that I have provided days when we have no class. Failure to attend class will result in  
          severe reduction of the final grade. 

Rough draft of research paper: **5%**  
          Due in my office by 2pm on Friday April 19. This should be 8 pages long and  
          cover all sections of the paper. It must be footnoted. These footnotes can be  
          rough, but must include author and page number of anything you cite. 

Research Paper: **25%**  
          This is due April 26 in class. We will discuss the research papers over the course  
           of the semester. They will be 12 pages long. 

Leadership of a class: **10%**  
          In the first class each student will choose which discussion they wish to lead. We  
          will meet to discuss the main themes of the readings and to discuss how the  
          student wants to conduct the class. I encourage you to bring in additional readings, visuals etc. 

Book review: **10%**  
           This is due in class on April 5. You will review a book that you are reading for  
           your research paper. It should be 650 words long and should identify the central  
           argument of the book and the contribution it makes to the field you are studying. 

Final Exam: **30%**  
          This will cover all the readings we have done in class.

ATTENDANCE:**

Punctual, regular attendance is a requirement; your grade will be dropped one
full letter, without warning, for every _five_ absences.

**

READINGS:**

You will note that on the Course Syllabus, every day the class meets is
identified, with every reading you are responsible for listed. Readings will
be from one of the four books (Nelson _,_ Toomer, Brooks, Shange), from the
web site that accompanies the Oxford _Anthology of Modern American Poetry_ ,
or from handouts. We will sometimes begin class with a quiz to encourage
everyone to keep up on the readings and to generate discussion.

**

ASSIGNMENTS:**

Assignments and instructions appear in your _Course Packet_ , and I will
explain them further in class. Out-of-class work must by typed on standard,
white paper (no onion-skin or erasable paper and no xeroxes) and must be
handed in on time. The due dates for assignments are listed on the Syllabus.
Submit your papers **at my office on the due dates by 5:00 p.m.** Unless we
have made arrangements well in advance of the due date, I will not accept late
papers. _Keep a copy for yourself in case the original is lost._ No secondary
reading is required or encouraged; however, if you choose to use sources, they
must be properly documented. Please review the University policy regarding
academic dishonesty (in the _Schedule of Classes_ ), which will be strictly
enforced in this class. All written work must be prepared according to the
"Format Instructions" (1) and will be graded for form as well as content, so
be sure to get help on writing (mechanics, argument, and style) and essay form
in plenty of time if you need it.

This course on the "Fate of the Twentieth Century" emerges out of a year-long
history faculty seminar (AY 95/96) sponsored by NEH, in which eighteen faculty
members studied the meaning and main processes by which they felt the century
would be remembered. By turning that seminar into a lecture course the
department is offering students the views of seventeen experts on the seminal
events and changes of the past 100 years and an opportunity to find and argue
their own interpretation of what the century has left us. **Warning:** this is
not a narrative history of twentieth-century world history. **Please drop this
course** if you want that. This is a compilation of multiple different and
sometimes contradictory  "takes" on the century; making sense of this approach
is one of your responsibilities as a class member.

**Required Books available in all the bookstores:**

  1. The guiding textbook is Eric Hobsbawm's _The Age of Extremes_. It has a clear point, is well written, but is unfortunately not comprehensive. If you desire more orientation you should also see Michael Adas et al, eds., _Turbulent Passage_. 
  2. Charles Stewart and Peter Fritzsche (eds.) _Imagining the Twentieth Century_ the scrapbook that emerged out of the faculty seminar.
  3. In addition, we will have two novels, a travel report, and a memoir that can be understood as documents of the twentieth century:

  
[Mongo Beti _The Poor Christ of Bomba_
(Heinemann)](http://www.history.uiuc.edu/hist212/bomba.htm)  
[John Scott _Behind the Urals_](http://www.history.uiuc.edu/hist212/scott.htm)  
[Bharati Mucherjee _Jasmine_](http://www.history.uiuc.edu/hist212/jasmine.htm)  
[Erich Maria Remarque _All Quiet on the Western
Front_](http://www.history.uiuc.edu/hist212/remarque.htm)

  4. And we will see two movies, _The Battle of Algiers_ and _Apocalypse Now_. Viewing times to be announced.

#### Licenses to Interpret

Each student will receive in their first discussion section a "license to
interpret" which assigns them to one of the five principal interpretations by
which our experts have framed the century. These"liceses" will be assigned by
alphabetic order of last names and they will define the main arguments license
holders will seek in readings, assingments, lectures, and discussion sections
for the first half of the course (up to the mid-term). Licenses must be
brought to each lecture and they will be periodically checked for attendance;
they must be presented at the mid-term and the final exam. The licenses are
design as "takes" on the century to help the class evaluate what is
distinctive or new in the century and what kinds of processes have motored
change throughout the century; they are not complete interpretations of
everything in the century. Thus, no one interpretation cancels out another.
While students must engage the interpretive issues indicated by your license,
they may, in the end, not agree with their centrality. Class discussions will
be guided by the interpretative themes and studies will be expected to move
beyond their license. In other words, the liceses exist to spur, not to
delimit discussions.

"Licenses to interpret" will be

(a) _In what ways was the 20th Century the **Century of the State**_? The
nation-state emerged as humankind's most effective political and cultural
expression and spread globally to provide values and standards for global
human relationships and economic exchange. The nation-state has become the
most important social formation and the most important social allegiance of
the twentieth century.  
(Last names A-D)

(b) _In what ways was the 20th Century the **Century of Mobilization**_? The
growing politicization and increasing mobilization of common folk across the
globe, the self-enfranchisemnt of the formerly disenfranchised, and the
economic empowerment of labor is what most distinguishes this century. The
political mobilization of people according to any number of social, ethnic,
class, and gender identities has most distinguished the twentieth century.  
(Last names E-J)

(c) _In what ways was the 20th Century the **Century of Markets and
Technology**_? From the  "second industrial revolution" of the 1890's to
today's mass markets for electronic gear in remote parts of the Third World,
the driving economic force that has shrunk the globe has been the expansion of
commerce and the development of new technologies in communications, medicine,
energy, and war.  
(Last names K-L)

(d) _In what ways was the 20th Century the **Century of Global Culture**_? As
the centruy began, Western cultural forms came to expert a global hegemony
over communities and groups. War and commerce accelerated the domination of
the West. In the second half of the century, movements of ideas, goods, and
people around the world have fashioned an emerging transitional culture in
which national and state boundaries matter less and less. This process was the
most significant development in the century.  
(Last names M-R)

(e) _In what ways was the 20th Century the **Century of the Individual**_? The
century began with strong notions of loyalty to family and clan, tribe and
ethnicity the world over, the century has closed off with a glorification of
the individual, a post-modern assertion of personal values and responsibility
and an atomization of competing forms of social allegiance and economic
obligation.  
(Last names S-Z)

#### Assignments and Gradings:

_Attendance_  
The format of this course demands attendance of lectures and discussion
sections. You will be required to reconstruct and evaluate ideas from the
lectures in essays and exams. Unlike other courses, however, you will see and
hear most lecturers only once. The many faces and voices you will experience
in History 212 this semester not only increase the value of this course, but
also its pace. You will be able to keep up only if you attend every class
meeting.

To emphasize the importance of class attendance and keeping up, recorded
absences from three meetings will drop your course grade by one-half grade,
six meetings will drop your course grade by one full mark, etc. For each day
an assignment is overdue it counts as an absence from class.

_Course information and discussion/feedback_  
Reading assignments are listed with the lecture topics (which wll not always
exactly correspond to the readings); two required feature films are scheduled,
both of which are available on video in the event you cannot come to the
evening screening times.

While the exact nature of the assignments have yet to be determined and the
due dates may change, the course grade will be determined by the following
(assignment sheets will be distributed in your discussion sections):

a) An interview with your oldest-surviving family-member on the events and
accomplishments and failures they judge of greatest importance in the
twentieth century (4-5 page essay, due week of Feb. 8th) [15%; [Assignment
Sheet](http://www.history.uiuc.edu/hist212/assignment.htm)]

b)An essay that argues for one of the licenses as it can be used to
demonstrate the historical messages from two of the following three assigned
works ( _Poor Christ of Bomba, All Quiet on the Western Front_ , or _Behind
the Urals_ ). (5 pages, due the week of March 8) [15%; [Assignment
Sheet](http://www,history.uiuc.edu/hist212/assignment.htm)]

c) A mid-term examination based on text and lecture material.[15%]

d) A small essay to be assigned (due week of April 26). [10%]

e) Final examination (cumulative: essay format plus identifications) [20%]

f) Discussion section participation (discussions, quizzes, in-class
assignments, debates, etc. TAs will inform you of the weighting of these
components). [25%]

By participation, we mean coming to class with a good understanding of the
week's lectures and assignments and a willingness to voice ideas and questions
that arise from your reading. Attending class without speaking will result in
a below average (i.e. D or grade) in participation.

_Criteria for grading essay work_



  * **A** = An essay that reads easily, is well organized and demonstrates the author's familiarity with the main arguments/interpretations found in the literature and with convincing data, examples, illustrations, episodes, personalites, etc. that are used to 'document' the main arguments/interpretations.
  * **B** = An essay in which an overall organization is apparent and is neatly presented but where arguments or data are incompatible (or not an accurate reflection of the literature on the subject) or in which arguments are set out without adequate proof, or in which relevant data is summarized extremely well but without arguments being adequate.
  * **C =** an essay written without any clear organizing principles and/or in which the author may either present only some of the arguments or some of the data and in which the author demonstrates a familiarity with the literature on the subject.
  * **D =** an essay that does not answer the set question, offers a version of lecture notes only, does not provide 'data' to support points made and is generally difficult to follow.
  * **F =** an essay that does not answer a set question, does not reflect a comprehension of the issues or arguments under discussion, and does not reflect the author's understanding of lecture material presented on the subject or readings.

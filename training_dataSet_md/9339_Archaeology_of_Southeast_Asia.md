# **Archaeology of Southeast Asia**

### **Anthropology 461**

Dr. Miriam T. Stark  
Spring 1997

COURSE OBJECTIVES: This course reviews the archaeology of Southeast Asia
during the Pleistocene and Holocene. Southeast Asian archaeology remains
poorly understood, although some of the earliest Asian hominid remains and
some of the most powerful states are found in this area of the world. This
course emphasizes the particularities of the Southeast Asian cultural
sequence, while illustrating how processes in this sequence parallel those
found elsewhere in the world. Topics to be covered include: geography and
environment; ecology and economy among peoples of Southeast Asia; history and
theory in Southeast Asian archaeology; the pleistocene and paleolithic record
of Southeast Asia; Hoabinhian and hunter-gatherers; origins of plant and
animal domestication; early farming communities; ethnicity, migration, and
culture change in Southeast Asian prehistory; early metallurgy in Southeast
Asia (timing, technology, and impact); models of complexity; emergent
complexity; and the early states of insular and mainland Southeast Asia.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Students are expected to complete all assigned readings
in _advance_ of each class discussion. There will be three (3) assignments
during the course of the semester that draw on both **lecture and reading
materials:** one short (10 pp. maximum) paper (worth 20% of grade), a mid-term
essay exam (25% of the grade), and a final paper (40% of grade). Class
attendance and active participation will also be factored into the grading
process (5% of the grade). Term projects must be approved by the professor by
the beginning of the 7th week of class.

**SPECIAL NOTES:** All assignments must be handed in on the due date listed in
this syllabus, except in cases of medical emergency. Barring such an
emergency, one grade (i.e., from 4.0 to 3.0) will be subtracted from the
assignment each day after the due date. All assignments must be completed in
order to receive a passing grade in the course.

_Required Textbooks_ :  
Bellwood, Peter 1985 _Prehistory of the Indo-Malaysian Archipelago._ Academic
Press, New York.

Higham, Charles 1989 _The Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia._ Cambridge
University Press, Cambridge.

**Archaeology of Southeast Asia** readings (on file in the Reserve Reading
Room at Main Library). These are also available for purchase at Kinko's.

**Class Papers  
** 1\. _Short Paper_ , 5-10 pp. This paper should focus on an archaeological
topic, in which you examine sites or artifacts of known provenience. You
should describe them briefly, give their context, and explain how they have
advanced our knowledge of archaeology, _or_ why they are a problem requiring
re-examination _or_ provide your own analysis (or all of these!). The purpose
of this paper is to have you deal with concrete archaeological data from
Southeast Asia and to make you think critically about archaeological evidence
and opinions.

2\. _Term Paper_ , 25-30 pp. This paper should be synthetic and interpretive
in its treatment of a topic in Southeast Asian archaeology. The long paper
will be presented as a seminar paper in the final week of the class; for that
seminar, you should have a one page (maximum) handout for class members. You
are encouraged to discuss your paper topic with me, and to submit paper
outlines for my comments. _Term projects must be approved by the professor by
the beginning of the 7th week of class._

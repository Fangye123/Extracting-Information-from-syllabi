**Class participation:** Evidence of growth throughout the quarter (and year)
by active participation   in class discussions and learning of new skills.
Willing to take initiative, engage other class members  in discussion, address
differences of opinions respectfully and turn in assignments on time.  
---  
**Journals:** Should be a reflection of your reactions (feelings and thoughts)
to information in readings, class discussions, and/or other experiences that
relate to the class topic. The journals   should not be a rehash of what we
did in class. Sometimes you will be asked to respond to a  specific question
in your journal. The journals will not be graded.  I may make comments on the
journal however the focus of the journals is on your own personal development
and integration of  the experience you are having in the program. The final
journal will consist of a summary of your experiences of the entire _year_
(i.e. how you feel you have grown or what you have learned during the year;
areas for future growth; and any suggestions for improvement in the peer
program). **FINAL JOURNAL DUE: 6/04/02.**  
**Paper:** Select a LGBT topic from the supplemental reading list and write a
book review **or** select specific topic within LGBT psychology using at least
7 references (3-5 from scholarly journals). Papers should be 5-7 pages plus
references. **Written reports will be** **due on :  ** **5/07/02.** You will

your paper and to facilitate a discussion on the issue. TBA.  
**Mid-life/Aging interview: Due: 4/30/02.** Select an LGBT individual over 50
years old to interview. Suggested interview questions will be provided.  
**Celebration project:** The theme of the project is celebrating LGBA
identity. Your task is to create, bring, share, demonstrate, in whatever way
you wish, some representation of how you celebrate being LGB or being a LGB
ally. **Due: 5/28/02.**  
**Letter to the group:** Write a letter to the group. The letter will be dated
June, 2007. Write the letter from the perspective that 5 years have passed and
that you are now telling the group members what has taken place in your life.
Include what memories you have of class, how you are addressing LGB issues in
your life now, and anything else that is important to you. Please bring 7
copies to distribute in class. We will share our letters in class.

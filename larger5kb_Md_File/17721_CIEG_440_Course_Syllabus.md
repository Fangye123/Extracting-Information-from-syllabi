**Catalog Description**  
---  
This course is designed to review   the fundamentals and practices of water
resources engineering within the Civil and Environmental Engineering
curriculum at the University of Delaware.  Students will explore water
resources engineering processes in the theoretical and applied realm in the
fields of closed conduit (pipe) flow, open channel flow, surface water
hydrology, and groundwater flow.  The water resources engineering curriculum
is designed to prepare interested students for future careers in water supply,
wastewater, floodplain, stormwater, and groundwater management. 3 credits.

**Course Objectives**  
---  
This course will enable students to:

1\. Understand the design of water resources systems utilizing the basic
principles of the hydydrolgic cycle and the watershed (Chapter 1).

2\. Review the fundamentals of fluid mechanics including fluid statics and
dynamics (Chapter 2).

3\. Master the computation of flow in closed conduits including pipelines,
pumps, and water supply systems (Chapter 3).

4\. Perform open channel flow design including water surface profiles,
floodplain delineation, storm water and sanitary sewer design (Chapter 4).

5\. Understand the value of probability and statistical analysis in deriving
precipitation and stream flow data (Chapter 5).

6\. Compute rainfall/runoff relationships for design of  stormwater management
systems (Chapter 6).

7\. Learn the equations of groundwater flow for applications in water well
development and infiltration basin design. (Chapter 7).

**Grading**  
---  
**Final grades** will be based on the following calculations:  
Participation/homework     25%  
Mid-term exam                  25%  
Final exam                         25%  
Design Project                   25%

Learning is enhanced when students can cooperate, rather than compete, with
each other,  Therefore, grading will not be on a curve.  If every student does
excellent work, everyone will earn a high grade in this class.  However,
please note:

        Quizzes may be given. 

        Weekly homework assignments will be given with homework due in class the following Monday. 

        No make-up exams will be scheduled. 

        No project will be accepted for grading after its due date.

**Class Format**  
---  
Learning about water resources engineering is an active process where students
participate in class discussions and hands-on exercises.   We will be meeting
in a class room with ITV and projection equipment.  We will be utilizing this
equipment for course presentations and demonstration of computer models. Two
sessions of the course will involve field reconnaissance and discussions of
case studies to explore actual applications of water resources engineering.
You are highly encouraged to ask questions regarding any topic on water
resources engineering.. Class participation and attendance for possible
quizzes is strongly recommended as it counts for up to 25% of your grade.  The
course work will be rigorous but completion of the course will properly
prepare you for a possible career in water resources engineering.  The
recommended class size is 30 to 35 students.  Students should have prior
knowledge of Fluid Mechanics.

**Project Assignments**  
---  
**Water Resources Engineering Term Project
DUE: Dec 5, 2001**  
Everyone will be assigned to a water resources engineering team of 4 to 6
students this semester. These groups will function independently during class
and outside of class.  For the term project, each team will select a water
resources engineering project such as floodplain delineation, stormwater
detention design, reservoir design, etc and prepare a six page report.  All
written work for the projects must be word processed (typed, spell checked,
etc.).  Each team is responsible for a 10 -minute presentation of each project
to the class due on Dec 5, 2001.

_Teamwork:_

A first step toward effective group functioning is establishment of agreed
upon ground rules. Each team will develop a set of guidelines and consider the
consequences for members who do not follow them. Make certain that all members
of the group have a copy of your ground rules and consequences.  Some
guidelines that have served other groups are listed below:

* Come on time to every class.   
* Be prepared to discuss the assignment. (A minimum of 2-3 hours preparation outside of class is reasonable for each class)   
* Notify other group members and the instructor in advance (phone or e-mail is fine) if you must miss a class.   
* Freely share the information you gather outside of class with other group members.   
* Use class time wisely.   
* Solicit and value contributions from every group member.   
* Group members who disrupt the group's function will not be tolerated. 

You are free to adapt these or to write other guidelines.  After you have
reached consensus on your ground rules, submit a copy signed by all team
members to Mr. Kauffman.

**Advice for Success**  
---  
Here are the top 10 suggestions for doing well in this course:

1\. Keep up with reading assignments and homework.  
2\. Go to all classes.  
3\. Get involved in class discussions.  
4\. Take advantage of working in groups.  
5\. Start project work early.  
6\. Make sure everyone in group contributes.  
7\. Research your projects extensively using the Water Resources Agency
library, text books, and the internet.  
8\. Have an open mind and apply what you learn.  
9\. Take charge of your own learning, do more than is expected.  
10\. Eat well, exercise regularly, and get adequate sleep!

**Policy on Student Class Attendance**  
---  
**Faculty Senate, December 3, 1984**  
**POLICY ON STUDENT CLASS ATTENDANCE** By action of the University Faculty,
the responsibility for defining attendance expectations is left to the
individual faculty member, subject to the guidelines given below.   Thus, it
is of great importance that early in each course the instructor make clear to
each student what attendance expectations are.

It is the policy of the University of Delaware not to cancel classes on
religious holidays.  However, students and faculty are encouraged to exercise
their own judgment pertaining to their attendance on these days.  In addition,
faculty are encouraged not to schedule examinations or require the submission
of special assignments on the following days: the evening before as well as
the first two days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur in the fall term, Good
Friday and the evenings before and the first two days of Passover in the
spring semester.  To facilitate planning for the potentially large number of
absences on these days the University shall include the dates of these
holidays in the academic calendar.  Adjacent to each of these dates the
academic calendar will include a reminder to consult the University policy on
excused absences.

a. Absences on religious holidays, as well as absences due to athletic
participation or other extra-curricular activities in which students are
official representatives of the University shall be recognized as excused
absences when the student informs the instructor in writing during the first
two weeks of the semester of these planned absences for the semester.
Absences due to similar events which could not have been anticipated earlier
in the semester will be recognized as excused absences upon notification of
the instructor by an appropriate faculty advisor or athletic coach.

b. Absences due to illness requiring medical attention and serious illness or
death within a student's family shall also be recognized as excused absences.
The student shall see that the instructor is notified as soon as possible.
The instructor may require the student to present evidence, such as a note
from a doctor, to substantiate his/her excuse.

c. Students are not to be penalized if absent from an examination, lecture,
laboratory, or other activity, because of an excused absence.  However,
students are fully responsible for all material presented during their absence
and faculty are encouraged to provide opportunities, when feasible, for
students to make up extra work missed because of an excused absence.

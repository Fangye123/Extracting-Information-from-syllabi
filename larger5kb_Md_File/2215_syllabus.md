Each student must participate in the community activities listed below and submit a short paper on your experience at the end of the semester. Community Activities--a. name your community, b. choose a community leader, c. write a statement defining who you are as a community, community purpose, and community goals, d. write rules for community membership. How will the community respond to those who violate community rules? e. plan community activities. f. select and agree to one community project in which each member will participate.

There will not be further instructions on this from me, although I will be monitoring community activity. You are to simply begin interacting with one another and attempting to forge community. In your final end of the semester report you should discuss your experience and such questions as, what are the problems in forming on-line community, how does it differ from traditional community, what is it like making community decisions on-line, and any other observations.

end of the semester of grade automatically becomes an "F." ( _San Antonio

  8. Statement on Retention

The faculty members of my department are committed to your successful
completion of our classes without lowering the college's academic standards.
As a department, we have set a goal to increase the number of students who
finish our classes with a performance grade (A,B,C, or D). As faculty (and
former college students), we have discussed the many pressures (work,
financial, family) that our students must face. Certainly, some of these
issues are beyond your control. However, there may be something that can be
done that would make the difference in whether you complete my course. If I am
made aware of circumstances that impact your participation in my class, I can
be of assistance. Although this syllabus is full of requirements and policies,
I am not inflexible. Pleas do not stop coming to my class or drop the class
without first talking with me. Dropping a course should be your last step. Be
aware that dropping may impact your grade point average, financial aid, and
health insurance policies (some require you to be a full time 12 hours
student). As an experienced instructor, there may be options that I can point
out that have not occurred to you. I am here to help you, but you must be
willing to help yourself. Do not wait until the end of the semester to ask for
advice. When you are successful as my student, I am successful as your
instructor. If you have questions about dropping a course, click on [Student
Services](http://www.accd.edu/sac/sacmain/students.htm) for information.

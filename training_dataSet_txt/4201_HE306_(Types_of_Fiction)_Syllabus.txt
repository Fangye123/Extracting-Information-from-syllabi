In HE306 we will examine the definition and conventions of the novel. 
First, we will review the critical debate over the origins of this genre

novel and will explore how these have changed over the last three hundred
years.

Course Policies
Format of Papers:  I expect you to type on the computer
all paper proposals and final drafts.  Other assignments (including
quizzes, tests, and rough drafts) may be handwritten.  Please double
space your papers, number the pages, and put approximately one-inch margins
on all sides. I will not accept handwritten final drafts, nor will I make
allowances for papers handed in late because of computer, printer, or typewriter
problems.
Writing Assignments:  You will write two four- or five-page
papers.  After you have decided on a topic, you will write a short
proposal (not more than a page) in which you will briefly discuss your
audience, your thesis, and your plan of organization. You will also write
one response paper and one summary of a piece of criticism; a list of requirements
for these assignments will appear shortly.  Finally, you will have
frequent reading quizzes and a final examination.
You must hand all papers in on time.  I will deduct a grade for
each class a paper is late.  Remember that the minimum requirement
for passing this course is to hand in all required essays.
Final Grade:
Essay One (final draft)        25%
Essay Two                        
25%
Response Paper

Final Examination

Participation

You will be allowed to revise the first major paper for a better grade
if you so desire.  I will average the original grade and the new grade
together to decide what goes in my records.  I will also drop the
lowest quiz grade.
Extra Instruction: I encourage you to seek extra instruction
during office hours if you need help.  Students receiving a grade
of C- or lower on any essay must make an appointment for extra instruction
as soon as possible after getting the essay back.

*****FINAL VERSION*****

**__Please note:_ I will be in my office (SOC 250) during my regular office
hours on Tuesday, April 24 (11-12:15) and again   at 2 pm; I have also added
office hours for student questions on Wednesday, April 25 in the morning
(approx. 10 am-approx. 1 pm )  .  _EXAM #3 is Thursday, April 26 at 9:30
a.m.__**  

The exam will consist of three sections: 1) a map exercise, 2) a short-ID
section,  and 3) an essay section.  **You will be responsible for material
assigned in the syllabus and covered in class meetings from** **_March 1
onward_ ** (this includes the Archaic Greece material in Martin [beginning p.
47] and the Hesiod reading in Bailkey [#20]: this is the area that was
assigned just before Exam 2 but was not included in that exam).

Section I: Map Exercise  
The instructions for this part of the exam will read as follows: _Identify
correctly the 10 places marked on the map (dots represent cities or sites;
cross-hatching represents regions, seas and islands).   Choose names from the
following list, and write your identification in the appropriately numbered
space on the map page (not on the map itself)._

The list on the exam will be selected from the entries below. Be sure that you
can locate the following places on your map.  Click on these links for
practice maps (use map of Alexander's Campaign, maps in texts or the map
handout from our last class to locate Near Eastern sites): ([Greece & Asia
Minor](grkmap001.jpg); [Alexander's Campaign
](http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/AAmap01a.GIF))

Section II: Short Identifications  
For this section, you will be given a list of names/terms selected from the
list below.  From the list, you will choose ten terms to identify.  Be
prepared to cite three pertinent facts for each.  To study for this, think in
terms of the following characteristics: 1) who/what is it, 2) when (period or
date), 3) why is it important, and, in some cases, 4) where is it (for
example, it is important to know that the Parthenon is in Athens or that
Xerxes ruled in Persia). **Dates** which you are required to know are listed
further below.

Section III: Essays  
Section III will be a selection of essays. You will be expected to refer to
**periods & dates**, use **terms** appropriate to the civilization and/or
period you are discussing (see below), and provide **specific names or
examples** (such as names of rulers, sites, monuments, or written evidence) to
support your discussion. You will be asked to write on two questions out of a
selection of three.   20 points each

***** Suggested topics of study for Section III (essays):*****

 ** _Note: The topics listed below are intended as a guideline only.   They
are provided in order to suggest the areas on which to focus your study for
the essays.  Essay questions will be __adapted_ _from these topics. Some of
the topic areas below are extensive as they will prepare you for a number of
possible questions. Remember to think about including specific examples
(including ancient sources of information), and be prepared to provide
relevant dates (discussed under "Study Tips" below)._**

  * The Persian Wars: Consider the major events, the causes, the protagonists and their backgrounds (including the Persian Empire), and sources of information.
  * The development of Athenian democracy under Solon, Cleisthenes and Pericles.  What was the role of the citizen?  What were the "institutions" of government by the time of the 5th century? What happened to the Athenian political system after the Peloponnesian War? 

  * Consider the political and social system of Sparta.  How did it compare to that of 5th century Athens?
  * What was the Athenian Empire? What was the "Golden Age of Athens"?  What led to its rise and fall? (This topic should include cultural as well as political characteristics).
  * The Peloponnesian War: Consider the parties involved, causes, policies and strategies, main events, results, sources of information. 
  * Discuss Greek religion (beliefs, ceremonies & festivals, types of offerings, settings).
  * What was the role of the Macedonians in the history of ancient Greece?  (Remember Hellenistic "successor kings" are a factor here too).
  * The character and career of Alexander the Great and the results of his conquests.

  
**Study tips:**

**Dates: 1)** Know the **centuries** involved for the Archaic Period (7th-6th
cent.), Classical Period (primarily 5th cent.), the rise of Macedonia/Philip
(mid-4th century), and the Hellenistic Age (approx. 3rd-1st cent.); 2) be able
to give an **approximate date** (or portion of a century) for the reforms of
Cleisthenes (500 BC is good here), the Athenian Empire,  and the Peloponnesian
War; 3) know **exact year dates** for the two phases of the Persian Wars (and
the main battles involved) and the death of Alexander the Great.   The dates
for the Persian Wars and Alexander will provide you with good "anchor" dates
that help you to remember the time periods of events that happened before and
after them.

BE  AWARE OF THE MAJOR WRITTEN EVIDENCE---consider the ways in which the
written evidence you have read (in Bailkey) contributes to the terms and
topics listed--be able to refer to some key examples in your discussions, when
appropriate.  Note: concentrate on literature/documents that were also pointed
out in class.

LOOK AT ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE TEXTBOOKS AND CLASS HANDOUTS. They are sometimes
sources of examples to support your discussion. LOOK AT MAPS IN TEXTS. Get
your bearings!!

The following terms will not appear in the ID list, but you should familiarize
yourself with them so that you can use them in your discussions in Section

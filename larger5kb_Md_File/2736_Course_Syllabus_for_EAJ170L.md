_Course Description:_  
This course will introduce the major elements of Japanese Culture. An
interdisciplinary approach will be followed, drawing from the fields of
history, anthropology, literature, art, religion, and philosophy. The course
will trace the development of Japanese culture from prehistory to modern
times. Emphasis will be placed on historical trends that have helped shape and
form the culture as a whole.  
This course is lecture-intensive. The reading is meant to be supplemental, not
the core of course material. Therefore, attendance is essential. Attendance
will be taken daily and students are expected to attend class regularly unless
extenuating circumstances prevent it. Questions and comments are welcome at
all times.

students are required to write one [1500-word paper](topics.htm). A simple
[map assignment](map.htm) at the beginning of the semester will be the only
"homework" of the class.

This syllabus a non-negotiable contract. I agree to teach the topics listed
below and to grade you on the criteria listed above. above. I consider a grade
of "Incomplete" to be for emergencies (death in the family, extreme illness,
etc.), _not_ for students who fail to plan ahead. **I do not curve grades. I
do not give extra credit assignments.** My grading scale is as follows: 93-
100%=A; 90-92%=A-; 87-89%=B+; 83-86%=B; 80-82%=B-; 77-79%=C+; 73-76%=C; 70-
72%=C-; 67-69%=D+; 63-66%=D; 60-62%=D-; 0-59%=E.

extenuating circumstances which you anticipate will unduly affect your grade,
**it is your responsibility to speak with me IN ADVANCE.**

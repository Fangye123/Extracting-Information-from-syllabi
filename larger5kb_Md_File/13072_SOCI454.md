**Course Description and Objectives:**  
This course focuses on current trends within sociological and social-
historical research and theory on racial and ethnic minority families in the
United States. Through an examination of this literature, we will explore the
historical colonization, immigration, and assimilation patterns of Americans
whose racial/ethnic groups remain distinct in our society, with particular
attention to the diversity of family life within these communities. Of
additional concern are the linkages between macro-level social systems in the
post World War II period (1945-2001) and the life chances and well-being of
minority families and their members. This course also takes a critical look at
institutionalized systems of racial and ethnic discrimination within the
present-day United States and the adaptive responses of families as they
attempt both to retain distinct cultural identities as well as improve access
to the American socio-economic opportunity structure.

The course includes lectures, discussions, readings, guest speakers, projects,
videos, and field trips. Students will be expected to stay current with all
course material and activities and to participate in class discussions. Videos
are part of the course content. A key component of this course is an
experiential learning focus. During the semester, both on- and off-campus
events and field trips will be part of the course requirements. Overall the
course is designed to involve the class in a variety of learning opportunities
in order to promote a better understanding of the complexity and diversity of
American racial and ethnic family experiences.

**Textbooks for Fall 2000 (required):   **The syllabus also includes required
readings that are not included in the three books listed below.  As these
readings become current, they will be made available through the Blackboard
Webpage (see Blackboard handout for more information.)

             They and We:  Racial and Ethnic Relations in the United States, 5th ed. 1997.  P. Rose.

             Minority Families in the United States, 2nd ed.  1998.  Ronald Taylor, editor.

             American Families: A Multicultural Reader.  1999.  Stephanie Coontz, editor.

**Evaluation and Grading Policy:** There will be a midterm exam, a project, a
journal, and a final exam. Each of these will be explained in greater detail
in class. Grading will be based on clarity of concepts, argument, writing,
organization, and attention to accurate detail. Class attendance is required.
Each student has two "free" unexcused absences; subsequent absences will count
against attendance points unless documented (e.g., doctor's note, funeral
card, etc.) The final grade will be determined as follows:

               Midterm            25 points   
               Journal              20   
               Project              20   
               Final exam        30   
               Attendance         5   
               Total points    100 points

Grading will reflect the following criteria:  
       A = exceptional work of excellence. The student has not only thoroughly completed all assignments but has also demonstrated independent initiative beyond the course requirements, a clear understanding of the material presented and tested, and the ability to organize her or his thoughts into correct and effective English writing.   
       B = above average work. The student has thoroughly completed all assignments and has shown a clear understanding of most of the material presented and tested, as well as the ability to organize his or her thoughts into correct English writing.   
      C = average work. The student has completed the basic requirements for the course and has shown a general grasp of the majority of material presented and tested, as well as a general ability to express herself or himself in English writing.   
      D = below average. The student has completed the basic requirements of the course but shows a less-than-satisfactory grasp of the material and a limited ability to express himself or herself in English writing.   
      F = failing. The student has failed to demonstrate a minimal understanding of the course material or has not completed the basic requirements of the course. Completion of all course material, however, does not in and of itself constitute criteria for passing the course; evidence of learning is also necessary.   
     Students who are unsure of their study skills are encouraged to contact the Learning Assistance and Study Skills Lab (LASSL) in the Counseling and Student Development Center. Call 753-1221 for further information or an appointment.

**Policy on Academic Misconduct, Otherwise Known as Cheating:**  
Cheating in this course is taken as a serious offense. This includes illegal
use of notes or other materials during exams, discussion of exam material
during the test with other students, the presentation of the work or ideas of
another person as your own (plagiarism), the unauthorized use of examination
materials, or other forms of dishonesty in academic matters. Offenders will be
disciplined through the procedures outlined in the Student Judicial Code on
Academic Misconduct.

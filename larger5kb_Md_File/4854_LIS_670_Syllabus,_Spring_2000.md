### Course Description

A survey of practices, problems, and theory relating to the processing,
storage, and retrieval of information in libraries, information centers, and
database search services. Non-conventional and computerized techniques will be
emphasized.

### Prerequisite

None

### Program Learning Objectives

This introductory survey course addresses the objectives of the LIS Program,
enabling students to:

  1. Demonstrate an understanding of the philosophy, principles, and ethics of library and information science. 
  2. Attain basic competencies and knowledge that are essential for providing, managing, and designing information services in a variety of information environments. 
  3. Demonstrate an understanding of the theories and processes for selecting and organizing information sources. 
Demonstrate an understanding of the theories and processes involved in
retrieval, dissemination, and utilization of information sources.

  4. Attain basic competency in the latest and specialized information technologies. 

### Course Learning Objectives

This is an introductory course which provides a basis for more advanced
courses in such areas as online/CD-ROM information retrieval systems, library
automation, abstracting/indexing, database design and creation, systems
analysis, and information and records management. Through these courses the
student develops skills in the use, evaluation, and selection of information
storage and retrieval systems, as well as some of the tools for their
creation.

### Course & Teaching Philosophy

In this course the emphasis is on exploration of technologies currently in use
or of potential future use in library or other information management
settings. New technologies necessitate formulation of new policies for their
usage. Thus, information policy-including ethical, political, and financial
issues-regarding utilization of technology in information provision will also
be discussed. Students are encouraged to give expression to their thoughts
concerning the employment of these new technologies in the library. My hope is
that this course will not only familiarize students with the technological
tools of the library today but will enable them to be innovators in the
formulation of new ways to provide information to both traditional and
nontraditional patrons of information services.

### Teaching Method

Lectures and class discussions will be used to introduce students to the
underlying theoretical issues of information storage and retrieval. Guest
speakers will bring to the course expertise in a variety of fields. Discussion
groups will allow students to share knowledge and insights gained from
independent readings.

### Requirements

  * **Readings**  
There is no required textbook for the course. Selected readings from books and
articles will be assigned. Students will be required to find articles or book
chapters, read them, then summarize it for the discussion group.

  * **Assignments**  
Instructions for completion of the assignments will be given out during the
course.  
Web Page (10 points)  
Short (one or two paragraphs) essays in reaction to articles or book chapters
read or web sites visited (10 points)  
Mid-term quiz (closed book and notes) (20 points)  
Ten-page paper and presentation (50 points)  
Class participation (10 points)  

  * **Grading scale**  
90-100 = A; 80-89 = B; 70-79 = C; 60-69 = D

### Technology Requirements

This course requires use of a computer for the written assignments, creation
of a World Wide Web page, and accessing Internet sites. PCs and Macs are
available in the LIS and UH computer labs but you must supply your own paper
to print. If you have access to a computer at home or in your workplace you
will need to obtain the handout for remote access from the Hamilton Library
reference desk.  
  
You will also be required to obtain and use a UHUNIX email account. This is
available free through Keller Hall.

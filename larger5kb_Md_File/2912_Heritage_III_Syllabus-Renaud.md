HERITAGE III: CULTURAL INTERACTIONS

Nota Bene: I reserve the right to make changes to the following syllabus. The
syllabus will soon appear on the web.

COURSE GOALS  
Through this course you will develop skills in written and oral communication,
process writing, critical thinking, listening and textual analysis. This
course will focus on the nature of cultural interactions and why an
understanding of how observe another culture is increasingly more important in
a global economy and the increasing diversification of American Society.
Please see the Heritage Guide for specific goals and objectives for Heritage
III (pages 26-30)

**ATTENDANCE**  
Attendance is an important part of your education and this course. Much of the
course revolves around class discussion. If you are not in class, you will be
unable to participate. Different approaches and analogies that are not covered
in the texts will be covered in class. If you know you must miss class due to
outside activities, please contact me prior to missing that class period. Once
you miss more than two classes for any reason during the semester, your grade
will be lowered by one grade for each class period missed. Class periods
before Fall and Thanksgiving Break are not optional.

**CLASS PARTICIPATION**  
Class participation is an essential part of this course. We will spend a large
portion of class time discussing the texts in both large and small group
environments. Please come to class ready and willing to share your ideas and
reflections on the texts and/or material.  
If you know that you are not going to be in class, be sure to contact me in
advance by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Only verifiable medical excuses
are considered valid reasons for missing a class. The only other exception
will be authorized and verified college events (e.g., sport meets, but not
practices or so-called earlier than usual departures.) These students will be
expected to hand in assignments BEFORE missing class, b) to write a two-page
reaction paper on a pertinent aspect to be covered at that time in the course,
and c) to return to class prepared with all required work completed.  
When you do miss class for any reason, you are responsible for contacting a
class member to find out what you missed, and yes, you do miss something when
you miss class. That is, you need to contact a fellow student about handouts
and you need to return to class with a) the work due for the day missed, b)
the word done for the day you return, and c) a two-page typed reaction paper
(for each class missed) on a pertinent aspect being covered at that time in
the course.

**READING THE TEXT/MATERIAL**  
In order to pass this course, you will need to read, take notes and think
about the text and/or material we are studying before you come to class. Each
student will be responsible for keeping a notebook in which text
notes/analysis are written and some class assignments are kept. The notebooks
will be evaluated. You may use your notes during the exams and for your
papers. I prefer that you use loose-leaf paper so you can continue working on
your notebook whenever I am reviewing the rest of your notebook. Place papers
in a pocket folder. Make sure your name is on it.

**EXAM(S) and QUIZZES**

Exams cannot be made-up or changed without prior permission of the instructor.
Attendance requirements for examinations strictly follow official college
procedures. You are responsible for understanding Carthage's _Community Code_.
All rules should be absolutely clear on taking exams. For our class, I do not
anticipate the need for quizzes unless I see empty notebooks and evidence of
slacking off. According to the policy of the College, all classes must have
finals and those finals are to take place at the time assigned in the
schedule.

**PAPERS**  
Every piece of work you submit presents a picture of you to the outside world;
make the effort to do a great job! All papers are due on the given due dates.
Papers will be lowered 1/2 grade for each class period late. If paper shows no
or little evidence of revision, or falls to complete the assignment, a
provisional grade of 'F' will be given. Further, if you turn in a paper as a
final draft and have not turned in drafts leading to that final version, you
will receive a zero for the paper. Each component of the writing process will
be assessed points. The average of the points equals the final grade on your
paper.

I recommend that all of you avail yourself to the services of the Academic
Resource Center (formerly the Writing Center) on the second floor of the
Library. Bring your paper ideas to them and they will assist you in fashioning
them into a coherent and effective essay. In an Honors class, you may not have
an acute need to seek the help of writing tutors, but all of us can work on
our writing. Gail Tsukiyama told me that she gives what she writes to her
group of writers to read, and to date she has published four novels.

  * All papers must be word-processed on a computer. 
  * When turning in papers, you must include two printed and stapled copies. 

_FIRST PAPER: Research Paper_

There will be one formal paper approximately 10 pages in length (excluding
footnotes and bibliography. For a guide on how to write a research paper, go
to site

_SURVEY_

In place of your second paper, we as a class have decided to conduct a survey
with the expectation that not only will we learn about our community, but we
will also develop important analytical skills.

Two preliminary drafts of your papers are required (though more will be
accepted). The first draft will not be graded though the second one will. You
must turn in your first draft along with your second draft, and your earlier
drafts with your final paper and a diskette with the paper in MS Word. The
final and drafts and diskette are to be placed in a pocket folder. Folders can
be bought at the bookstore. Grades on draft papers will not be increased
unless your revision is a) a true re-envisioning of the paper, and b)
significantly better than your draft. However, the grade marked on your second
draft is not a guarantee that you will receive that grade or higher on your
final paper. I will not read any draft papers the week prior to when the paper
is due.

Papers will be graded based on the following components: extent and accuracy
of research, originality of thinking, logical consistency of the argument,
structure, grammar, and syntax. Still, unless your revision is visibly better
than your original, your grade will remain unchanged.

**You will receive a handout stating the requirements for each paper and the
format to be used typing papers. Any question of the authorship of the papers
falls under the purview of the instructor and the College's rules regarding
academic honesty. See below.**  
  
**DOCUMENTATION AND PLAGIARISM**  
During the semester, you will have the opportunity to write at least two
papers. _Cliffs' Notes, Monarch Notes, Max Notes_ , and other notes of their
ilk. may not be used as a source in writing your papers. You are responsible
for reading and for understanding Carthage's Student Conduct Code with respect
to citing sources and plagiarism. The _Heritage Guide_ defines plagiarism and
gives you places where you can determine if you are plagiarizing or not.
Please see pages 31 ff.

**ORAL PRESENTATIONS**  
You will present two formal oral presentations during the semester. Each
presentation will be approximately 3-5 minutes. The first oral presentation
will be a 3-minute presentation that contains a discussion of the thesis
statement and major arguments for your research paper. The second oral
presentation will be a 5-minute persuasive speech on the judgment made in your
research paper.

Each oral presentation will be evaluated based on presentation skills,
clarity, understanding of the material and the ability to answer questions
and/or facilitate a discussion. No credit will be given to students who fail
to show on the date of their presentation.

**PORTFOLIO**

>  
>  The following materials must be present in your semester portfolio:  
>

> * Self-evaluation essay  
>

> * Final drafts of all papers  
>

> * All drafts leading to final drafts of papers  
>

> * Outlines, mind maps, think pieces, notes leading to paper  
>

> * Clean copies of any chosen response writings/think pieces/outlines and
summaries of papers.

The portfolio will be graded on a Pass/Fail system. If your portfolio is not
acceptable and/or complete, you will not pass the course. You will receive
your portfolio back on final exam day. You are responsible for keeping your
own portfolio. Every year, starting in February, we have the Heritage
Scholarships, and for the competition, you will need to present your
portfolio.





**Grade Criteria:**

A: A students demonstrate enthusiasm for and mastery of the material. They
actively engage ideas related to the texts and achieve valid interpretations
and analyses of the texts. They complete all assigned work. They possess a
command of the English language and express their ideas effectively. They
continually work to improve their written and oral communication skills. They
push themselves and they regularly contribute to the class in an informed and
constructive manner.

B: B students virtually always do the reading, come to class prepared and
willing to try, and contribute to the class regularly. They strive to
understand the main ideas of text and to connect these ideas to related
themes. They complete all assigned work. They are capable in their use of the
English language and in expressing their ideas. They continually work to
improve their written and oral communication skills.

C: C students complete nearly all of the assigned work, but some of the work
inadequately. They do not push themselves to understand the texts or to relate
the texts to other ideas. They do not contribute actively in class. These
students attempt to improve their written and oral communication skills, but
are often unsuccessful.

D: D students do the minimal work required in class. They are usually
unprepared for class and do not contribute in class discussions. Their written
and oral communication skills are below average. These students do not attempt
to improve their communication skills.

o Coming to class on time

o Coming to class prepared

o Not talking when someone else is speaking

o Positive attitude

o Demonstrating tolerance to alternative points of view



**FINAL COMMENTS**  
Please remember that you are responsible for your own learning and knowing the
given due dates. In addition, the instructor reserves the right to change the
syllabus, when appropriate. The class will be informed of any such changes.

**I look forward to working and learning with all of you.**

HERITAGE III (205): CULTURAL INTERACTIONS  
_Tentative_ Course Map  
Fall 2000

> "But let me first make one general point that is fundamental and essential
to the appreciation of African issues by Americans. Africans are people in the
same way that Americans, Europeans, Asians, and others are people. Africans
are not some strange beings with unpronounceable names and impenetrable minds.
Although the action of Things Fall Apart takes place in a setting with which
most Americans are unfamiliar, the characters are normal people and their
events are real human events. The necessity to even say this is part of a
burden imposed upon us [African writers] by the customary denigration of
Africa in the popular imagination of the West. I suspect that, in any class of
thirty American students who are reading Things Fall Apart, there are a
handful who see things in the light of a certain young reader from Yonkers,
New York who wrote to thank me several years ago for making available to him
an account of the customs and superstitions of an African tribe! It should be
the pleasant task of the teacher, should he or she encounter that attitude, to
spend a little time revealing to the class some of the quaint customs and
superstitions prevalent in America." Chinua Achebe

> Culture hides more than it reveals, and strangely enough what it hides, it
hides most effectively from its own participants. Years of study have
convinced me that the real job is not to understand foreign culture but to
understand your own. I am also convinced that all one ever gets from studying
a foreign culture is token understanding. The ultimate reason for such study
is to learn how one's system works." Edward Hill



Please make use of the _Heritage Guide_ , 2000-2001. In the new version, there
are brief biographies of each author and the times in which he or she lived.
It is my expectation that greater contextualization of the texts will assist
you in understanding them better.

**T. R. Reid, _Confucius Lives Next Door_**

T. R. Reid, _Confucius Lives Next Door_ , Chapters 1 and 2. In each seminar,
we are starting with an "approachable text" to center the focus of the class.
After you have read Reid, you will be reading an essay on cultural
interactions, including Martha Nussbaum's "Why Study Non-Western Cultures."

**Essays on Cultural Interaction and Communication**

To make clear what Heritage III: Cultural Interaction focuses on and how we
should approach the study of cultures different from our own, it may be
beneficial to look over the cultural studies goal and objectives in the new
Heritage Guide and read some of the following essays (to be given to you in
advance.)



1\. [Introduction to Intercultural
Studies](/departments/heritage/intro2ic.htm)  
2\. [Stumbling Blocks in Intercultural
Communications](/departments/heritage/stumbling.htm)  
3\. [Communication in a Global Village](/departments/heritage/village.htm)  

[Japan Information Network](http://www.jinjapan.org/)

**Master Kung Fu-tzu (Confucius)  
(551-479)**

S. Leys, _The Analects of Confucius_ and T.R. Reid, "The Master Kung" in
_Confucius Lives Next Door_.

Chinese Chronology

My recommendation would be that you read the introduction in Leys' book, look
for themes (ritual, harmony, family relationships, learning, etc.), and read
Leys' copious notes on the _Analects_ pertaining to a given theme, and report
to class what you have learned.

To see a listing of the key themes in the Analects, go to:
[http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cu
ny.edu/~phalsall/texts/analects.html](http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/analects.html)

At Halsall's site, you will find the following Confucian themes: Jen
(humaneness), Junzi (the superior man, gentleman, or scholar), Li (rites),
Yueh (music), Learning and Teaching, Government, and Rectifying The Names. To
be sure, other themes are present, but if we ask the students to pull together
related Confucian ideas, they will have a better understand of his basic
principles.

Please note that not all of the _Analects_ are attributable to Confucius

On reserve in the library is a book titled, _Confucius Speaks_. _Confucius
Speaks_ is the product of the same team that has given us _Zhuangzi Speaks_.
Finally, read Reid's chapter (4) on Confucius (pages 91-126) so you can see
what Reid considers as modern applications of the principles of Master Kung.

Video: The Emperor and the Assassin (1999). Released last year, the events in
the film take place at the end of the Warring States period (221 BCE) when the
Qin (Chin) ([http://www-
chaos.umd.edu/history/imperial.html#first](http://www-
chaos.umd.edu/history/imperial.html#first)) dynasty seeks to unite the other
six kingdoms under its rule, and thereby unify China. The Qin dynasty lasted
only 15 years before the Western Han Dynasty. What is interesting in the film
is the advice given to the Emperor: be a benevolent ruler, something Confucius
advocated in his teachings.

**Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu, c. 369-c. 286 BCE)**

_Zhuangzi Speaks_ by Tsai Chih Chung (C.C. Tsai). When the author was trying
to think of ways of transmitting the complex ideas of Taoism, as articulated
by Zhuangzi, to his readers in Taiwan, he came upon the idea of using the
medium of the cartoon to clarify, not simply Taoist thinking. His work was an
immediate best seller in Taiwan, according to Brian Bruya, who has translated
C. C. Tsai's works into English. Tsai has gone on to write and draw _Confucius
Speaks_ and _Zen Speaks_. In Asia, Taoist thinking, as well as the influence
of Confucius, still lives. _Zhuangzi Speaks_ will help prepare you for what
follows: _The Art of War_.

On his web site, Professor Jim Lochtefeld has an astonishing short guide to
Asian religion/philosophy. His address is: <http://www.carthage.edu/~lochtefe>

The "Afterword" in Zhuangzi is very useful in clarifying Zhuangzi's
philosophical ideas. He also contrasts Taoism and Confucianism.

The philosophical roots of Taoism stem largely from the Tao Te Ching, a text
traditionally ascribed to Lao Tzu but probably written in the mid-3rd century
B.C.E. The Tao, in the broadest sense, is the way the universe functions, the
path (Chin. tao=path) taken by natural events. It is characterized by
spontaneous creativity, and by regular alternations of phenomena (such as day
following night) that proceed without effort. Effortless action may be
illustrated by the conduct of water, which unresistingly accepts the lowest
level and yet wears away the hardest substance. Human beings, following the
Tao, must abjure all striving. The ideal state of being, fully attainable only
by mystical contemplation, is simplicity and freedom from desire, comparable
to that of an infant or an "uncarved block." Both are completely unformed, and
thus have limitless potential; both also exist in their unaltered, natural
state (this is in sharp contrast to the Confucian stress on learning and self-
development). Taoist political doctrines reflect this quietistic philosophy;
the ruler's duty is to impose a minimum of government, while protecting his
people from experiencing material wants or strong passions. The social virtues
expounded by Confucius were condemned as symptoms of excessive government and
disregard of effortless action.

Second only to Lao Tzu as an exponent of philosophical Taoism was Chuang Tzu,
[Zhuangzi] who authored brilliant satirical essays. He did differ sharply from
Lao Tzu on the question of political involvement, which Chuang Tzu deemed
totally incompatible with the Tao, and to be avoided at all costs. Later
Taoism emphasized the techniques for realizing the effects supposed to flow
from the Tao, especially long life and physical immortality. The search for
the elixir of life and the philosopher's stone stimulated the study of
alchemy.

By the 5th century C.E., Taoism was a fully developed religious system with
many features adopted from Mahayana Buddhism: a large pantheon (probably
incorporating many local gods), monastic orders, and lay masters. Taoist
ideals, particularly the stress on the natural and the unformed, had great
influence on Chinese literature, painting, and calligraphy, and also played a
significant role in the development of Ch`an (Zen) Buddhism. Throughout its
history Taoism has provided the basis for many Chinese secret societies, and
in the 1950s, after the establishment of the Communist regime, Taoism was
officially proscribed, but it is still practiced to some degree in modern
China, particularly at the local level.

**Sun Tzu, _The Art of War_ (Translated by Thomas Cleary)**

[Thigpen's Art of War--a summary](

http://acc6.its.brooklyn.cuny.edu/~phalsall/texts/artofwar.html)

While there is much potential for The Art of War to be misappropriated,
misunderstood, and misread, it is highly unlikely to happen with this
particular translation:

* Thomas Cleary is a renowned Sinologist whose approach to classic Chinese texts is as holistic as the texts themselves.  
* Cleary's introduction is comprehensive. He focuses his attention on the philosophical underpinnings of The Art of War thereby expanding and enhancing the interpretations of the text. Cleary links The Art of War to Taosim and Zen Buddhism and also to other Taoist and Buddhist texts.  
* Cleary's introduction also places The Art of War in historical and literary context. He provides a detailed explanation of the structure of the text itself, and he defines terms, which would otherwise be problematical for non-initiates of the so-called Eastern Canon. In addition, Cleary is a clear and concise writer.

There are a number of advantages to having The Art of War as a text in
Heritage III:

* The text transcends its "national" origin. The Art of War is essentially a Taoist text. Taoism did originate in China, but Taoism "traveled" from China to most parts of Asia. Its influence is most strongly felt, outside of China, in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. As such The Art of War is more than a Chinese text. Its Taoist and Buddhist elements provide insight into not only Chinese but also Japanese culture. This is not to suggest that China and Japan are "similar", for they are not. As Taoism and Buddhism have throughout Asia, they have been adapted and "localized." That, in and of itself, makes this text important for it will clearly illustrate the nuances in Asian cultures, thereby creating opportunities to understand the complexity and the diversity of cultural encounters. It provides the possibility to see that translation takes place on multiple levels. This may help us to shift the East versus West paradigm.  
* Since this text is Taoist and Buddhist in its essence, it is a holistic text. That is, it may be examined and analyzed in a number of contexts. _The Art of War_ may be used to understand science, history, business, society, or literature. Like Taoism and Buddhism, _The Art of War_ cannot be confined to any particular discipline. In this respect, it is a highly flexible text.   
* Many of the elements covered in _The Art of War_ will provide considerable insight into the text, which will follow it: _The Samurai's Garden_ (see below). First, this text highlights the complexity and the difficulty of translation) of the terms war and warrior. It provides a means through which we might better understand the character Matsu ( _The Samurai's Garden_ ). Second, from an analytical standpoint, _The Art of War_ presents us with a number of frameworks through which various Chinese and Japanese concepts may be understood (i.e., humanism, syncretism, adaptability, localization, harmony, change and so on). Each of these concepts is manifest in the other Heritage III texts as well. Third, because of the present (and ongoing, actually) popularity of The Art of War, there exist unlimited resources available, in various media, to further understand and explain this text. Even the serious and egregious misappropriation of The Art of War in our popular culture provides opportunities to examine the ways in which texts are often used or read. Much of these gaps in understanding are highly relevant in a course whose focus is cultural encounters.

Questions:  
* In your opinion, what are the components of intrapersonal conflict? Interpersonal conflict?  
* How has an appreciation of another's point of view lead to understanding and to resolving a conflict?  
* How is resolving conflict an art? Can you point to examples in your life, community, or the world?  
* Where do you see evidence of paradox in the resolution of a conflict?



Suggestion: Read the introduction first and then have them read what the
master says without the commentary. In this way, you may grasp more
immediately what the Art of War about--the avoidance of conflict.

**Basho (1644-1694)**

  
Basho's most famous work is Narrow Road to a Far Province, where he
intermingles haiku and linked poetry composed by himself and others with his
prose account of his journey. Basho's poetry is an integral part of his
travels from Edo (Tokyo) to Ogaki. It may be instructive to have the students
discover what Basho considers important.  
*

  * In what way is his travel diary different from, say, a typical western one? 
  * What kind of details does he include? What does he leave out?  

**Hamer and Copeland, "Thinking: Inheriting Intelligence,"  
_Living with Our Genes_ , 201-235**

Not so long ago, for example _The Bell Curve_ , it was held that intelligence
depended on one's race. In _The Mismeasure of Man_ , Stephen Jay Gould
effectively refuted such a premise. Hamer and Copeland address the issue from
genetics. There are a couple of recent articles from _The New York Times_ (see
above) that discuss the cultural basis of thinking.

**Kurosawa's _Ran_ and _Madame Butterfly_**

After Hamer and Copeland, we will encounter different kinds of text: film and
opera. We will be looking at Kurosawa's _Ran_ ( _War_ )

The inclusion of _Madame Butterfly_ may be startling but the opera itself is a
wonderful, if tragic, depiction of what happens as the result of cultural
misunderstandings.

Giacomo Puccini (1858-1924) was the composer of some of the world's more
famous operas, including La Boheme, Tosca, and Turandot. In 1900 he saw a
performance of Madame Butterfly, a play by David Belasco and John Luther Long.
To translate the play into an opera, Puccini listened to Japanese music and
consulted the popular Japanese actress, Sada Yacco. To Puccini, the plight of
Madame Butterfly (Cio-Cio-San) appealed to his tragic sensibilities, but in
viewing the opera, you discover what happens when you misunderstand a culture
to the extent that you romanticize and exoticize it as Pinkerton does.
Pinkerton, the lead male character, refuses the advice of his friend at the
American consulate and marries Cio-Cio-San, who takes the marriage seriously.
Because she embraces his Christian God, her family ostracizes her. Pinkerton,
who earlier made clear his intent on having an American wife to Sharpless,
leaves Butterfly to return to his ship. Three years later he returns to claim
his son, but not Cio-Ciao-San. Butterfly then makes the decision to die with
honor and so she commits suicide.

Gail Tsukiyama, _The Samurai's Garden_

This text offers new possibilities when it comes to the notion of cultural
encounters. The novel set in the late 1930's (and therefore during the Sino-
Japanese War) examines cultural interaction on a number of levels:
Chinese/Japanese, Japanese/Western, male/female and so on. The novel centers
on the principal character, a twenty-year old wealthy Chinese university
student who travels to Japan's seashore to recover from a bout of
tuberculosis. His presence in Japan, at this particular time, serves to
illustrate a number of crucial issues:

* The westernization of China, which is evident by the use of western names  
* The deference paid the Chinese by the Japanese  
* The differences in artistic and aesthetic sensibilities between Japanese and Chinese  
* The growing contempt of the Japanese vis-a-vis the Chinese as the war drags on and as China crumbles and bows before the Japanese military  
* The tension between Japanese and Chinese identity particularly when it comes to intermarriage  
* The concept of beauty as challenged by some of the members of the Yamaguchi leper colony  
* Gender issues

**Description:** The course is designed to support the University of
Delaware's goals for preparing teacher candidates to become reflective
practitioners serving diverse communities of learners as scholars, problem
solvers, and partners. Scholars are grounded in the knowledge of their
disciplines, in pedagogical content knowledge, and in theory and research
concerning individuals, families and communities. Problem solvers construct
practical, effective approaches to professional challenges using a sound base
of theory and research, and help others construct their own ways of addressing
challenges. Partners support the positive development of children,
adolescents, and adult learners within families and communities, going beyond
narrow academic concerns to give attention to the emotional, social, and
cognitive dimensions of student's lives.

Introduces prospective teachers to technology available for use in
mathematics, science, and social studies curricula. Enables students to
evaluate this technology by applying pedagogical approaches studied in methods
courses. Concludes with a teaching project incorporating the use of
technology.

**Special Needs:** Any student desiring reasonable accommodation in any
procedures used in this class should notify the instructor at the beginning of
the semester. Special services can and will be made available.

**Text: _Integrating Educational Technology into Teaching_** by MD. Roblyer,
Jack Edwards, and Mary Anne Havriluk **(IETT)**

Additional readings will be placed on reserve in the Education Resource Center
throughout the semester and are available via Electronic Reserve.

**Prerequisites:** Students are expected to have completed Educational
Technology I, II, and III. Students should be familiar with basic concepts in
hardware and software and proficient with common tools such as word
processors, spreadsheets, e-mail, and Internet resources.

* * *

**Requirements:** In addition to attending class, students are expected to
familiarize themselves with the software used in class by spending time with
it in the School of Education microcomputer sites. Weekly reading assignments
are to be completed in preparation for each class meeting. The following
activities are also required.

**1\. Software and Web reviews**  
Each student will be expected to complete three written reviews of technology
based instructional  
computer software and three Web sites.  For each discipline area there should
be one review of a software and one review of a Web site. .

Submitted Web Reviews](http://feurerpc.oet.udel.edu/webrev/showwrevs.html)**  
  
**2\. Lesson plan incorporating technology.**  
Each student will be expected to choose an application from an approved list
and to complete a lesson plan based on that application. The project should
consist of a detailed examination of the curricular materials, background
reading, and development of a detailed lesson plan. The outline for the lesson
plan and description of sections can be found below. This lesson plan must be
in a different content area than your presentation.

**[Details on Lesson Plan](http://udel.edu/~jperry/etlesson.html)**

**3\. Presentation of Lesson Plan.**  
Working in pairs, students will make short (15 minutes) oral presentations in
class, based on a lesson plan they have developed which incorporates a complex
example of instructional software. **Five** class sessions will be devoted to
these presentations. The lesson plan must not be in the same content area as
the individual lesson plan described above.

**[Details on Oral Presentations](http://udel.edu/~jperry/oral.html)**

**4\. Attendance**  
An attendance sheet will be distributed at each class meeting.

**5\. Quizzes:**  
Quizzes on readings can/will be given each week to make certain students are
coming to class prepared.

**Grades:** Grades will be determined by the following [grading
scale](http://udel.edu/~jperry/grades.html). This scheme may be altered at the
discretion of the instructor, but notice will be give along with reasons for
any changes in class.

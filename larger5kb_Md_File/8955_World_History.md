**SS2104    Contemporary World History**

![](GreatWave.jpg)  [CHRONOLOGY,
1688-1995](http://dibner.poly.edu/digital_library/tmp/151.204.199.98_09_07_00_13_17/chronology%20routing.htm)  
Professor Soffer put together a chronology of world history.  It includes
links to short pieces on particular events or people, and some primary souces.
You might find it helpful.  Don't be confused by the "Back to Syllabus" link.
That is Professor Soffer's syllabus, not ours.  |   [Internet Modern History
Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html)  
Many of our primary sources come from here.  There are many, many others and
also links to sources on East Asian history, Indian history, Women's history
and others.  It is a very nice browse.

**Announcements**

See the links to Marx and Engels writings and to Hitler's speeches in the
Resources section.

Your final [exam review sheet](FinalRevSpr2001.html) is now available!  We
will meet this coming Monday, May 7th in RH 202 form 11-1pm for a final review
session.  All traditional papers must be handed in on Monday and all websites
must be previewed by then.  The exam is on Friday May 11th from 1-4 pm.  I
have written the exam as a 2-hour exam, but you will all be free to take the
full 3 hours.

**April 18th   **You have a paper or webpage due on May 7th.  I would like a
thesis statement from you on  
Monday April 23rd.  Here is the link to the [assignment.](Nazipaper.html)

**April 10   **Take a look at [Dror Guzman's page
](http://pages.poly.edu/~dguzma01/CM/WadeGiles.htm)showing three famous
Chinese political leaders and explaining the  
difference between _pinyin_ Romanization and Wade Giles.  We will be meeting
TOMORROW, April 11th at  
11 am on the steps of the Metorpolitan Museum for our tour of the new 19th and
20th century Chinese painting exhibit.

**Feb 3.   **I will be collecting your reading journals this Monday.  Please
bring in your first papers on Wednesday for the writing workshop.

Your next assignment is to visit the [Chinese
collection](http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/department.asp?dep=6&mark=2#a)
(the Charlotte C. Weber Galleries for the Arts of Ancient China) at the
Metropolitan Art Museum.  This [gallery guide ](Metsheet.doc)will help
introduce you to five of the pieces of art from ancient China and to the Astor
Court.  We will be going for a group tour later in the semester to see art
from modern China with the guide who prepared this gallery guide.

I am asking you to choose one of these pieces to write a short essay on
(250-500 words).  Please complete this assignment by February 28th, but I
recommend doing it this coming week if possible.  (You will have another paper
due a week earlier on February 21st.)  What did you find particularly striking
or significant about the piece?  Describe this feature or aspect of the piece.
Then explain why you found this particularly interesting.  For me it is the
_taotie_ design from the Shang period.   No one really understands its
significance or why it disappeared in the works of art from the Zhou dynasty
which followed.

The Metropolitan is at 1000 Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street.  Take 4, 5, or 6
train to 86th Street and walk three blocks west to Fifth Avenue.

**Jan 22.** Welcome.  Please browse through the links on the left.  There are
discussion questions posted already for some of the texts.  More will be
posted as the semester goes along.  Take a look at the maps and references.
This page will be continually updated so you should check it frequently.  The
syllabus also will be updated during the semester so you should do your
assignments from the web version rather than one you print up at the beginning
of the semester.

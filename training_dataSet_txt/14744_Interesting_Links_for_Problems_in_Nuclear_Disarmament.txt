Hiroshima 
        moving/zooming panoramas on the WWW. 
          Here is how to get to the two photo-panoramas, photography by Shigeo 
        Hayashi, now in his 80s, who still has rights to these pictures. To be 
        seen they require something like "live picture viewer," see below. You 
        might want to print this page as a guide before you click on this next 
        link. 
Go to

http://www.peace-museum.org/    
          Note: This page may still be in Japanese. 
Click 
          on the large blue symbol; this will take you to the ...welcom.htm page 
Click 
          on photo gallery 
Click 
          on gallery entrance 
Click 
          on panoramic views of Hiroshima; this will open a skinny horizontal 
          window. 
Scroll 
          down to the 3 small pictures; the left one and center one are Hayashi's 
          panoramas. Click on either picture to get moveable, zoomable image, 
          provided you have installed something like "livepicture" viewer. In 
          this skinny window also is reference to livepicture viewer. 
You can 
          download livepicture viewer and install 
          it into your PC. I found it easiest to use Netscape Navigator and BOTH 
          download and then install in the folder that contains all the Netscape 
          Navigator Plug-Ins. 
Read the 
          directions there; on the left side, you want imaging software, live 
          picture viewer, zoom viewer 3.2, and good luck. 
The third 
          panorama (part of the NEAR SHIMA HOSPITAL group of 3) was taken by a 
          U.S. Army Research Group and I do not believe there can be any copyright 
          on it.

**Description:** This course is designed as an upper-level colloquim
introducting some of the most important themes in "American identity" in the
post-Civil War United States

**Objectives:** _First_ , this course explores the contested articulations of
"the American" as a possible component of identity in the post-Civil War
United States through a study of both theory and applied case studies.
_Second_ , it hopes to equip students with some of the categories of analysis
and historical background to help them negoatiate the complexities of both the
American past and American future. _Third_ , this course seeks to train
students in the life-long habits of disciplined learning and careful thinking.
Students will hone their skills in effective analysis and communication (i.e.
writing and speaking).

**Method:** In order to meet these complimentary goals, the course will meet
once per week for discussion. Students will read about one book or its
equivalent in articles per week. Students will be expected to take an active
and informed part in discussion and to come to class well prepared. There will
be no examinations. Students will display their mastery of the material
through a final project, in any format, which integrates theory, theme (race,
class  & gender) and case study using primary sources.

**Requirements** :

  1. **Your score will be computed as follows:** Discussion (50%) + Final Project (40%) + Presentation of Final Project (10%) 
  2. **All readings are required.** It will not be possible to do well in this course without reading the assigned material. 
  3. **Regular class attendance is required.** These sessions are graded and failure to attend the scheduled session will adversely affect your grade.[N.B. All students are expected to make an effort to participate in discussion (and helping you become more comfortable in such situations is one of the goals of this course). However, if you are extremely uncomfortable in such situations, please see me and we can discuss alternatives.] 
  4. **Satisfactory completion of a final project is required.** This final project takes the place of a final examination and constitutes fourty percent of your final course grade. The project must integrate theory, theme (class, race, gender) and case study using class readings and some additional sources. It may be presented in _nearly_ any format of your choosing, such as an 10-15 page paper, video production or web site. (Those choosing alternative formats may be asked to prepare a 5 page explanation and a bibliography of sources--of any media--consulted).

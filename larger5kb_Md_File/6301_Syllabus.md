Introduction:

This course will have two parts. In the first, we will explore the concepts of
Quantum Mechanics qualitatively, using the book "Where Does the Weirdness Go?"
as a guide. This will give you an overview of the early experiments that
defied classical physics, giving rise to the new world of quantum physics. It
will also introduce you to the radical shift in how we think about physical
systems that quantum mechanics represents. This shift in thinking is
counterintuitive to those of us who live in the macroscopic world, but is
necessary in the realm of the very small--where quantum mechanics applies. It
is my hope that this qualitative overview will help explain why we need
quantum mechanics and get you thinking in a quantum mechanical way, before we
get too hot and heavy into the complex mathematics of actually doing quantum
mechanics.

When this is complete, we will dive head-first into the second part of the
course, actually _doing_ quantum mechanics. This will require that you learn a
great deal of new and complex mathematical formalism. For this reason we will
only cover approximately four chapters in "Introduction to Quantum Mechanics"
(if that much) this term. There's a lot of mathematical meat in those
chapters, though, so there is much for you to learn. Next fall term, in
Advanced Quantum Mechanics, we'll continue the journey and work through more
of the book. In my mind, I thus view this as a _year-long_ sequence in quantum
mechanics, with this as only first term. It is my sincere hope that all of you
will continue on to the second term of the course, so that you have a more
complete view of introductory quantum.

I also strongly recommend that you read "The Dancing Wu-Li Masters". This
tells the same story as Lindley's book, but from the perspective of a non-
physicist. The author makes many connections between the world-view of quantum
mechanics and Eastern spiritual philosophy. Some of these connections go too
far, in my opinion, applying quantum mechanics to realms where it doesn't
really apply. But this glimpse into the effects of 20th century science on
20th century thought is interesting and useful! The gap between physics and
philosophy is narrower than you might imagine.

The language of quantum mechanics is advanced mathematics. In this course, you
will need extensive background in calculus. You'll be taking lots of
derivatives, and doing even more integrals. In general, I'll expect you to DO
your integrals the first time you encounter a particular class of them, and
we'll also do them in class. After we've learned how to do a particular class
of integrals, though, you can (and should!) make use of integral tables such
as those in the CRC whenever possible--or use those fancy calculators. (I want
to make sure that you know how to DO the math here, but I also don't want to
make you reinvent the wheel every time a familiar integral appears.) You'll
also need a smattering of trig identities. I hope you didn't sell back your
calculus text!

In addition, the fundamental equation of quantum mechanics, the Schroedinger
Equation (which you will solve for many different physical situations), is by
nature a partial differential equation. Thus it helps if you have had
differential equations in a math class previously, or are taking it
concurrently. If not, don't panic! We'll explore the meaning of and methods
for solving such equations in class.

Finally, you will discover in Chapter Three of Griffiths that linear algebra
(matrix algebra) is extensively used in quantum mechanics. Again it helps if
you've had linear algebra in a math class, but we will spend a great deal of
time learning the portions of this mathematical tool that are useful to
quantum theory.

Quantum Mechanics is not an easy subject--either conceptually or analytically
--but it is none-the-less one of my favorites. When you go to graduate school,
you will likely take an additional two or more years of advanced quantum
mechanics as part of your course requirements for a M.S. or Ph.D. in physics,
or about a year of Quantum Chemistry (Physical Chemistry) if you're headed for
a degree in chemistry. This course is designed to get you familiar with the
language and mathematics of this complex and beautiful model of the physical
world in the realm of the very small. But we will only scratch the surface.
There is much much more to come!

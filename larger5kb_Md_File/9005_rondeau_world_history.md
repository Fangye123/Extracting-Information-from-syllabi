**_Course Description_** ** _  
_** This course is the first of four chronological surveys of the history of
the world, from ancient times to the present. History 120 deals with the
ancient civilizations of the world as they were established and developed
before they came into contact with one another. Since one larger purpose of
the world history surveys is to help you understand how present global systems
have come into being, History 120 focuses on the centers of civilization that
came into significant contact with one another in the period covered in the
following term (History 121), namely, the various civilizations of the
Mediterranean and Ancient Near East (Mesopotamia, Egypt, Israel, Greece, and
Rome), India, and China. We will consider the political, religious, economic,
and social organization of these civilizations, in order to understand their
cultural systems and the ways in which they were similar to and different from
one another.

  
  
**_Requirements |_**top of page

  * Completion of weekly reading assignments, drawn from the following: 
    * Upshur et al., _World Civilizations_
    * a xeroxed reader of selected primary sources, available for purchase at the bookstore
    * _The Epic of Gilgamesh_
    * _The Bhagavad-Gita_
    * Plato, _Euthyphro, Apology, Crito_
  * Participation in weekly discussion sections. These discussions will focus on the readings in primary sources, indicated on the schedule below. Primary sources are documents that date from the actual period we are studying in this course. You will note that they are for our purposes mostly literary or religious, because these are the documents or texts that have survived and been studied enough to be available in English translation. Study questions will be provided in advance of the discussions, to help you understand and prepare your readings and locate them within the larger historical framework provided by the textbook and the lectures. They will also help you prepare your on-line contributions -- for more about this assignment, see the next item.
  * Participation in an archived listserv discussion. You will be subscribed to an electronic discussion list, specific to your regular in-class discussion section. You will be required to contribute to the discussion in two ways: by posting a well-designed discussion question to the list ONCE during the term, and by responding on-line AT LEAST ONCE EACH WEEK to your classmates' questions, or to their responses to the questions. You MUST follow the more detailed requirements for this component of the course described on the separate page called [_About the Class Listservs_](listserv.htm) _._ You will also be expected to take your on line discussion with you into class (either printed out, or in your own notes, or simply in your head), to help you explore the materials there. Toward the end of the term you will rewrite one of your contributions as the [_Listserv Assessment_](listserv.htm#assessment) assignment. Note below that your paper topics and some of your exam questions will be based on your work in designing and discussing these questions.
  * Completion of 8 map exercises, due in your discussion sections on dates specified in the schedule below. These are fairly simple exercises designed to help you understand the vital geographical component to the study of the past.
  * Two 3-4 page papers comparing different aspects of your primary sources, due to your GTF in lecture on dates specified in the schedule below. Questions for the papers will be designed by the section leaders (GTFs and the professor) in consultation with one another, on the basis of your in class and on-line discussions. If you choose to write on a question or topic outside the list, you may do so, but you must consult at least one week in advance with both your GTF and the professor.
  * A midterm and a final examination, to be held on dates specified in the schedule below. Each exam will contain short essay identification questions and one or two longer comparative questions (see [_Midterm Guidelines_](midterm_guidelines.htm) _, Final Guidelines_ ). In addition, the final exam will contain one larger, more complex question you will receive in advance, in order to prepare your materials for writing it during the exam period. Again, your on line and in class discussions will form the basis for the longer essay questions on both exams.
  * Participation in a final review session, to be held in lecture the last day of class. For more information, see the separate page called _Final Review Guidelines._

**_Classroom Behavior and University Policy  
_** Just to remind you, the Student Code of Conduct contains the following two
passages relevant to your participation in this course. Each paragraph
describes a category of offense, with an eye to preventing these offenses and
maintaining academic integrity for all of us:  
(1) Dishonesty, including academic cheating, academic plagiarism (submission
of the work of others for academic credit without indicating the source), or
knowingly furnishing false information to University officers of instruction
or administration.  
(2) Intentional disruption, obstruction or interference with the process of
instruction, research, administration, student discipline, or any other
service or activity provided or sponsored by the University.  
Intentional disruption is rare, but in a large class like this one
unintentional disruption can occur quite easily. In order to avoid it, I'd
like to remind you at the beginning that you are expected to arrive to class
on time, and to remain quietly in the lecture hall until the end of class. If
you absolutely must arrive late or leave early, please sit on the aisle in the
back and enter and leave as quietly as possible. Usually at least one of the
GTFs will be sitting at the back of the lecture hall if you need help.  
Cheating and plagiarism occur rarely. Let me simply remind you that they will
not be tolerated, and will be dealt with according to the Student Code of
Conduct.

_** If you are unfamiliar with this, or any, form of e-mail communication, DO
NOT PANIC. Part of this course is designed to teach you the simple foundations
of networked communication. We do not assume that you have any on line
experience at all. The large numbers of you who no doubt do have such
experience can just sit back and relax, and maybe help out your less
experienced classmates (and probably instructors!), while we get through the
preliminary procedures and only then launch into using them to facilitate
classwork. Please be patient. The lists are a new component of this course,
and all the instructors welcome and encourage feedback from you about how it's
working for you, and especially suggestions for how it could work better. We
want to use them to help you discuss and analyze the sources better and more
thoroughly, together and individually -- in other words, to do better history.

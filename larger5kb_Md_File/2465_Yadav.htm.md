Honors 121: Reading Cultural Signs  
Fall 1999/ Prof. Alok Yadav

In this course, we use semiotics (the study of signs and signifying systems)
to "read" nineteenth and twentieth century American culture. We examine how
signs carry meanings and how these meanings change over time and in diverse
contexts. We attend to some of the kinds of the meanings prevalent in modern
American culture as well as some of the ways in which such meanings are
circulated. Our focus this semester will be on three broad terrains of modern
American culture: consumer culture (including advertising, packaging, shopping
malls); the Wizard of Oz and the creation of an American myth; and Christmas
as a social ritual from the nineteenth century to the present. Each of these
three segments of the course allows us to think about the functioning of
signsand sign systems in a distinct institutional context (marketing of
consumer goods; formal cultural production; social ritual or
festival)--although we will also examine the ways in which overlap and
convergence among these three domains has occurred across the twentieth
century.

Course Requirements:

1\. Three formal papers (20% each): These 3-4 page, double-spaced papers will  
allow you to elaborate on issues and themes taken up in the main sections of  
the course. The first of these papers will go through a preliminary draft and  
then a rewrite following comments. The due dates for these essays are  
indicated on the syllabus.

2\. Eight single page microanalyses (20%): These short, single-spaced papers
are  
responses to issues that arise in the readings, class discussion, or other
work  
we do for the class. They are designed to help you prepare for class  
discussion and/or reflect on the readings and apply the results of what you
are  
learning. These micro analyses will be assigned over the course of the  
semester as indicated on the syllabus.

3\. Group project (10%): This will be an opportunity for you to work  
collaboratively in small groups on one portion of the course material. Each  
group will be asked to present to the class a discussion of one chapter of  
Stephen Nissenbaum's book, The Battle for Christmas.

4\. Class participation (10%): Regular attendance and engagement and  
participation in all class discussions will be the basis of this evaluation.  
Regular, punctual attendance is necessary. In a seminar class like this, your  
contribution is vital to the class's success. You must come to class regularly  
and be prepared to contribute to the discussion. Please bring the assigned  
readings and syllabus to each class period.

Your work must be your own, done for this course alone.

Writing Across the Curriculum:  
In the Honors Program, students complete a variety of writing assignments  
throughout the program. The writing in this course contributes to the College  
of Arts and Sciences composition requirement.

Class Policies:

Essays: All papers are due at the beginning of class on the assigned date. Do  
not leave papers in my mail box (except as noted on syllabus); they will be  
considered late. I will not accept papers on electronic mail. Late papers  
will be penalized half a grade for each day they are late--unless you have  
discussed the problem with me before the due date and I have approved late  
submission. (I will not do this for routine reasons; moreover, late papers  
will receive only a grade, without comments.) You must turn in all papers for  
a passing grade in this class. All essays should be typed, double-spaced, with  
regular (one-inch) margins, and a standard size font (not larger than 12). All  
pages but the first must be numbered. Staple the paper in the upper left-hand  
corner; do not use a cover sheet or plastic cover. Include your name, the  
date, the class number and section, and the paper number at the top of the  
first page of your essay. Your work must be your own, done for this course  
alone (see statement on plagiarism, below).

Short Assignments/Quizzes: Short answer assignments and in-class quizzes
cannot  
be made up if they are missed or if they are not turned in on time. (You will  
receive a zero for that particular assignment/quiz.) All out-of-class  
assignments should be presented in accordance with the style guidelines for  
your essays.

Participation: Class participation minimally requires that you arrive on time  
to class and that you be consistently prepared to discuss the assigned  
reading. Students who fail to attend regularly should not have unrealistic  
expectations about their final grade.

Plagiarism:  
When submitting work, please remember that plagiarism is a violation of the
GMU  
Honor Code. Plagiarism means using words, opinions, or factual information  
from another person without giving that person credit and, thus, presenting it  
as one's own work. Writers give credit through accepted documentation styles,  
such as parenthetical citation, footnotes, or endnotes; a simple listing of  
books and articles at the end of a document is not sufficient. Nor does a  
rearrangement of another person's phrasing (paraphrase) release one from the  
obligation to document one's sources. Plagiarism is a form of fraudulently  
claiming someone else's work as your own, and as such is the equivalent of  
cheating on an exam; it cannot be tolerated in an academic setting, and is  
grounds for failing at least the assignment if not the course.  
If you are unclear about what you should document, please come see me.  
Alternatively, if in doubt, document the statement.

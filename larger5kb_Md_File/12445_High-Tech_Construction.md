PREREQUISITES:** Senior (with approval of instructor) or graduate standing.

**

COURSE DESCRIPTION:** Introduce major technologies, including mechanical
(HVAC), electrical, and piping systems, that define the functionality of
constructed facilities. Focus is on 'smart' buildings and 'high-tech'
industrial projects. Describe system terminology, engineering design
characteristics, components, and materials. Stress construction and
installation methods and procedures. Discuss contractual relationships and
coordination requirements during project execution between owners, design
firms, and general as well as specialty contractors.

**

EXTENDED DESCRIPTION:** Architects, design engineers, construction engineers,
as well as owners' representatives either work with or must coordinate the
work of specialists, including mechanical, electrical, plumbing/piping (MEP)
contractors. They must speak these contractors' language and understand their
design and construction methods and requirements. This is particularly
important when architects/engineers have to re-design systems and approve
changes made in response to field problems. Operating MEP systems also
constitute a large part of the life-cycle cost of a facility. Such systems
require replacement usually much sooner than the structure they are a part of
and they are expensive to operate. Architects/engineers are therefore likely
to get involved in related retrofitting work. It also is becoming more common
for construction engineers to join a design-build team, where the best design
and construction solutions can be worked out only when all team members
understand the constraints faced by others and can effectively communicate
their needs.

The course thus focuses on the terminology, engineering design
characteristics, components, and materials that are used in building and
industrial construction. Principles of design are covered in class.
Construction and installation methods are discussed in class and re-visited
during field trips to project sites and contractors' home offices. Class and
field discussions include contractual relationships and coordination
requirements between owners, design firms, and general as well as specialty
contractors. **

COURSE OBJECTIVES:** Enable students to become familiar with terminology and
technical understanding of systems in state-of-the-art buildings and
industrial facilities. Help them develop technical background to anticipate
and avoid or solve construction problems. Gain better understanding of AEC
participants--especially specialty contractors--roles and contribution to
successful project completion.

**

ORGANIZATION: ** Topics include engineering and construction of HVAC, piping,
electrical, and security systems; integrated building controls; clean rooms;
power generation.

TEXTBOOK: ** Tao, William K.Y. and Janis, Richard R. (2001). _Mechanical and
Electrical Systems in Buildings._ Second edition, Prentice Hall.
0-13-013711-1. REQUIRED.

**

ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADING:** Students will be graded based on class
participation, field trip reports, and a final term project which includes a
report and a presentation. Term project is based on research, conducted by
students in teams of three, to assess the functionality and constructability
of a specific technology or to assess the effectiveness of a specific
project's organization. Students will present their work in class at the end
of the semester. There are no mid-term or final exams.

Class Participation: 10%  
Homework and Field Trip Reports: 40%  
Final Term Project: 50% total, including report (35%) and class presentation
(15%).

**

COURSE MATERIALS:** Handouts will be provided in class. A reader will be
available later in the semester. Students should read all materials and
prepare questions prior to the corresponding lecture. ![ ](byline.gif)

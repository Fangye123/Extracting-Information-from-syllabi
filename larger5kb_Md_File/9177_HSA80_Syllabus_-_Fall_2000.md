## Historical Studies A-80  
The Cold War

### Ernest May

The Cold War commenced at the end of World War II. It continued for forty-five
years &endash; until the beginning of the 1990s. The chief rivals, the United
States and its allies, the Soviet Union, and the People's Republic of China
stood at sword's point for decades. Their nuclear arsenals threatened not only
one another but the planet. At times, Armageddon seemed at hand. Limited wars
were fought -- in, among other places, Korea, the Middle East, and Southeast
and South Asia. Spies and secret agents warred covertly in all quarters,
including Latin America and Africa. Rivalry extended into outer space. Yet the
Cold War never became World War III. And it ended suddenly and unexpectedly,
with the Soviet Union simply coming apart.  
This course explores the history of the Cold War both as a clash of states and
of ideologies and as the cultural setting from which the post-Cold War world
emerged. As a core course illustrating historical reasoning, it offers
opportunities to think about how one reconstructs any past experience and how
individual choices and actions interact with, influence, or are controlled by
wider social, economic, intellectual, and institutional forces.  
The course involves **Lectures** , **Sections** , **Four Short Papers** (up to
3 pages each but preferably 1 page) and **One Longer Paper** (10 to 15 pages).
There is a **November Hour Exam** and a **Final Exam**. Grades will be based
10% on the hour exam, 30% on the final exam, 25% on the required short papers,
25% on the longer paper, and 10% on participation in Sections.

**_Required Reading_ :** Every book listed can be bought at the COOP or other
local stores or on line. All are on reserve in Lamont, Hilles, and the Kennedy
School Library. Most other readings are in a Source Book, which will be
available for purchase early in the term. It, too, is on reserve. A few
readings, listed in assignments for particular section meetings, can be
downloaded free of charge from the web site of the Smithsonian Institution's
Cold War International History Project. For one section meeting, as noted, a
fifty page selection is available **only** on reserve.

HISTORICAL STUDY A-80 _Source Book_

**In addition** , each student will be expected to choose an individual and to
do some reading on that individual's biography. Obvious choices are major
political figures such as Presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Nixon, or
Reagan; Communist leaders Stalin, Khrushchev, Gorbachev, or Mao; or other
heads of government (Churchill, Macmillan, Thatcher, de Gaulle, Adenauer,
Nehru,  
Nasser, Castro); but other choices include spiritual or intellectual leaders
such as Pope John Paul II, Martin Luther King, or Raymond Aron or cultural
symbols such as John Wayne, Elvis Presley, or the Beatles. Prof. May and
course section leaders will help in making choices among individuals and
sources or writings.

**_Required Viewing:_** During the course of the term, all students will be
expected to watch five films available on videotape from local or on-line
distributors with copies on reserve in the various libraries. All will also be
shown in auditorium settings at evening hours to be announced.

For sections in the week of Oct. 16-20  
_"On the Beach"_ (d. Stanley Kramer, 1959)  
For sections in the week of Oct. 30-Nov. 3  
_"The Manchurian Candidate"_ (d. John Frankenheimer 1962)  
_"Three Days of the Condor"_ (d. Sidney Pollack), 1974)  
For sections in the week of Nov. 6-10, **EITHER**  
_"Seven Days in May"_ (d. John Frankenheimer, 1964)  
**OR**  
_"Fail-Safe"_ (d. Sidney Lumet, 1964)  
Prior to the Nov. 20 hour exam  
_"Dr. Strangelove"_ (d. Stanley Kubrick, 1964)

**_Papers:_**  
**Short Papers** : The ideal short paper will be _one_ page double-spaced
(250-300 words), but, since good short papers are hard to write, short papers
up to three pages long (or 750 words) will be tolerated. These papers are
intended to focus section discussion, and no late papers will be accepted. To
accommodate varying interests and competing time demands, options will be
offered for both topics and due dates. In between, students can arrange with
their section leaders to write or not write papers. Any student may write as
many papers as he or she wishes, but no student has to write more than four
short papers in all. And the final grade for short papers will be the average
grade for the four.

**The Long Paper** , due at the end of the reading period, should be an
exercise in original historical reconstruction. It should be ten to fifteen
pages (or 3,000 to 5,000 words). It could build on the earlier biographical
reading or on films viewed during the term. It could, on the other hand, be
drawn from files of your home town newspaper or newspapers or be about the
experiences of some member or members or your family or some other persons
whom you found opportunity to interview. Topics are negotiable. You will be
asked to indicate a tentative paper topic in the bluebook for your Nov. 20
hour exam.

_ESSAY #1_ (required of all students)

In India unlike other areas where Muslim armies triumphed most of the
population never converted to Islam. There were from the first, therefore,
serious questions raised about the "Islamic" quality of Muslim states and
societies in South Asia. Based upon your reading of Ibn Battuta and your text
state whether you think the Delhi Sultanate of the fourteenth century was or
was not an "Islamic" state.

In writing be certain to define your terms and justify your conclusions with
accurate quotations that should be precisely footnoted at the end of the
essay.

4-6pp.

Due: the Friday of the 5th week of class.

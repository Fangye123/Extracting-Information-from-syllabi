### Credit

3 semester hours of credit  
Prerequisites: Either INSS 510, INSS 520, INSS 530 or permission of the
instructor.

  

### Course Description

This course provides an in-depth look at two principle phases of the
information systems development life cycle: analysis of system requirements,
and system design. We will consider various approaches to the gathering and
analysis of system requirements, and we will see how a good specification of
user requirements contributes to an effective system design. We will study
both the structured and the object-oriented methodologies.  
  
The course will cover CASE (computer-assisted software engineering) as applied
to systems analysis, design and task estimating. Current trends will be a part
of this course, including business process reengineering, client-server
architectures, networks, and the UML (Unified Modeling Language). There will
be an overview of other phases of the entire development life cycle, to gain a
better understanding of the role of requirements specifications and design in
the success of information systems.

### Objectives

Students who successfully complete this course should then be able to
understand:

  * How to look at an existing information system, define requirements for changes, and evaluate alternative solutions.
  * How requirements are combined with technology to create a system design.
  * How to document and communicate system requirements and designs to users.
  * The terms and concepts currently accepted in systems analysis and design.
  * How to apply the concepts and principles of systems analysis and design to given problems.

### Office Hours and Communication

Students may request individual discussions before or after class, and by
appointment. Messages may be left for me in the University of Maryland office,
or by e-mail (phone numbers and e-mail address to be announced at beginning of
term).  
  
Also, I will try to keep a web site going during the term, where information
and copies of assignments can be posted. The URL will be announced at the
beginning of the term.

### Policies

Class attendance is expected. Students are responsible for all material
covered during lectures and discussions, as well as assigned textbook
readings. In order to have lively and effective classroom discussions,
students should read assignments and case studies and think about them before
class.  
  
On such matters as exceptional grades, academic dishonesty, interpersonal
behavior and attendance, the policies expressed in the current Graduate
Catalog of the University of Maryland in Europe will apply to this course.

  

### Instructor

Mr. Wiswell received a BA in History from Stanford University, and an MA in
History from the University of London. He worked for over twenty-five years in
the computer industry as programmer, systems analyst, data base consultant and
project manager. He has taught for the University of Maryland in Europe for
eight years.  

### Project

There will be a term project where students can acquire the experience of
using software engineering methods to organize information for problem-solving
and to create useable designs. Because teamwork is a standard part of the
professional software environment, at least some part of the projects will be
conducted in teams. During the first week of the course, guidelines for
project content will be handed out, and we will decide how to organize the
projects in a way which allows for constructive student cooperation and at the
same time encourages and recognizes individual student work.  

### Course Standards

Exams will cover both text and lectures. They will consist mostly of short
answer essay questions, and technical problems in systems analysis and design.
Each exam will include an essay question of the type found in the MIS Graduate
program comprehensive exams.  
Students will be graded primarily on their written work. Good presentation
skills are also important, however, and will help contribute to the grade. In
both written assignments and verbal contributions, students are encouraged to
follow the maxim, " _Content before form_ ".  

#### Written assignments:

Black ink on white A4 or 8.5x11 paper, in a standard typewriter face such as
Courier, or 11- or 12-point Times New Roman. Line spacing double-spaced or
1.5.  
No color or graphics, except for (1) charts or maps generated by the student
to convey substantive information; or (2) as an artifact of the subject being
studied, in support of a point discovered or being argued by the student.  
Where there has been research, use a consistent, generally accepted, format
for citations.

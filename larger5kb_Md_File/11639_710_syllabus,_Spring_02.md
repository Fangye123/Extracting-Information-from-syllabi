### Course description

The goal of this course is to help students apply the knowledge and skills of
librarianship to support information seeking on the Internet. There are many
roles librarians can play in providing access to information sources on the
Internet. This course focuses on three major roles: Librarians as searchers,
as authors of Web pages and Web sites, and as teachers of information literacy
programs. Students will examine information tools on the Internet (including
basic Internet applications, search engines, subject directories, and
bibliographic control tools created by librarians) and discuss search
strategies. They will review selection criteria and practice evaluating
Internet resources. They will also learn the principles of Web page design and
use HTML, Dynamic HTML, and Dreamweaver to create attractive and interactive
Web pages. To be prepared for teaching challenges, students will examine
learning theories and teaching styles and discuss issues related to the
design, delivery, and evaluation of information literacy programs. By the end
of the semester students will be able to

  * Know the types and nature of information on the Internet and the efforts at organizing such information. 
  * Search the Internet efficiently and effectively by taking advantage of various search tools. 
  * Evaluate and select Web pages for a selected group of users. 
  * Understand Web page design principles and create Web pages. 
  * Design and deliver information literacy programs on Internet resources. 
  * Understand the challenges of the changing information environment and the roles of libraries and librarian in this environment. 

### **Teaching Methods:**

Lectures, discussions, exercises, and project reports.

### **Evaluation:**

In addition to in-class practices, students are expected to complete the
following requirements:

  * **Class participation** (10 points): Active participation is expected of students. A discussion group will be set up for students to share insights and questions throughout the semester. 
  * **Preparatory exercises** (6 points): Students are required to visit the three Web pages of search tools, comment on each group of tools, and be prepared for class discussion on the strengths and limitations of the search tools. Students will turn in their written comments on the days of class discussions. 
  * **Project 1: A search exercise** (14 points).   
Students will be given a set of questions to search on the Internet. They will
develop search strategies, identify information sources, find answers, and
explain how the answers are located. See Project 1 description for details.

  * **Project 2: Evaluation of Web sites or search engines** (20 points).   
Each student will compare the Web sites of two similar organizations in terms
of their resources and architecture. Another option is to compare the search
performance of two engines that are similar in scope. This project includes a
10-minute presentation. **Topics of this project must be approved by the
instructor.** See Project 2 description for details.

  * **Project 3: Web page/site creation** (30 points).   
Students may work alone on this project or with one partner. There are three
project options. Students may 1) create a Web site on a selected subject, 2)
re-design an existing Web site, or 3) create a Web site for a digital
collection. This project includes a 15-minute presentation. **Topics of this
project must be approved by the instructor.** Because this project can be
quiet complex, students are encouraged to identify topics for this project
early in the semester. See Project 3  description for details.

  * **Project 4: Information literacy program** (20 points). **Team projects (two persons per team).**  
Each team will design an information literacy program to teach a selected
audience how to search and use electronic information resources (can be
Internet resources, online databases, online catalogs, or CD-ROM databases).
Students will select topics for coverage and use a mode of instruction most
appropriate for the program and the audience. **Topics of the BI program must
be approved by the instructor.** This project includes a 12-minute
presentation. See Project 4 description for details.

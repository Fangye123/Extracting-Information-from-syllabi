**I. Aims: Learning from History  
** The aim of this course is to learn from history. Specifically, we examine
four periods of change in the history of U.S. education, and consider what
those episodes can teach us about what Americans have tried to achieve through
education, and how such experiments have succeeded or failed.  
Ultimately the objective is for participants to incorporate these lessons into
their own experiences as educators and educational leaders. To that end
students are asked to write four essays, each of which focuses on different
historical material and emphasizes a different kind of historical inquiry. It
is my intent in assigning these essays to help students improve their
abilities to appreciate history, to understand historical ideas, to critique
historical interpretations, and to formulate historical arguments.

**II. Content: Idea and Practice  
** "It is part of wisdom," John Dewey wrote in 1916, "to utilize the products
of the past so far as they are of help to the future." This is a progressive
idea. That is, it is one statement of the ideas which characterized
progressive educational and social reform in the United States from 1890 to
1930.  
With this statement, Dewey reminds us that the results of past social
experiments live on in the present. One point of studying history, then, is to
understand how institutions of the present came to be the way they are. How is
it, for instance, that school teachers came to be organized into unions? The
answer to this question also lies in the progressive era. The formation of
teachers' unions was one of the consequences of attempts to put progressive
ideas into practice.  
In this course we will examine such connections between idea and practice.
Thus we will study some of Dewey's ideas about progressive education, and we
will look at some of the results of progressive reform in the case of Seattle
public schools. The aim will be to understand what didn't happen as well as
what did. In history, as in life, we learn from failures as well as from
successes.  
A second point of studying history, in other words, is to help us imagine
alternatives to the present. Today we take for granted state systems of
schooling, but state educational systems did not always exist. In the late
colonial and early republican periods, Americans like Benjamin Franklin
educated themselves through a combination of apprenticeships, pay schools,
charity schools, rural community schools, learning societies and academies.
Now some "school choice" reformers advocate abandoning the public school
system for a market-based plan of independent schools. What lessons can we
learn in this regard from the diverse and independent schooling of early
America?  
Many of the issues of 19th century school reform are still with us in the late
20th century. The violent conflicts over school desegregation which occurred
from Little Rock to Boston in the 1960s and 70s were the legacy of battles
waged over common schools in northern cities and the reconstruction south in
the 1850s and 60s. The ongoing question of which versions of history and which
cultural traditions to teach in the schools also had precedents in the era of
common school reform, from 1820 to 1860.  
One way of posing many of the crucial issues in education today is to ask
whether the common school ideal is still viable. The question is whether
Americans any longer have enough in common to make an integrated school system
possible and desirable. Another way of posing the issues is to ask whether the
"academic ideal" has declined. Is the aim of education to conserve and
reproduce a culture? Or is it, as Dewey the progressive believed, to change
culture and society? At the end of this course students will be expected to
address such issues using good historical evidence and argument.  
  
**III. Form: Four Episodes  
** The course is divided into four sections, each of which covers a different
period in U.S. history:  
A. Education before the Educational System, 1730 to 1830  
B. The Common School Ideal and Common School Reform, 1830 to 1890  
C. Progressive Education in Idea and Practice, 1890 to 1930  
D. Education and the American Dream, 1930 to 1990  
Each section includes two class sessions and one written assignment.  
Reading assignments for the class are of several different kinds. They include
first-person accounts of educational ideas and experiences from leading
historical figures and educational leaders such as Benjamin Franklin, Emma
Willard, W.E.B. DuBois, and John Dewey. First-person accounts from more
ordinary Americans are provided by sample letters from pioneer school teachers
of the 19th century, by the letters of an African-American student and an
African-American teacher during the same period, and by black and white
families who participated in the desegregation of Boston schools in the 1970s.
Readings also include studies by historians: a study of the common school
reform movement, from 1790 to 1860, by Carl Kaestle; a case study of
progressive school reform in Seattle by Bryce Nelson; and excerpts from a
study of changes in the ideas of American history taught through 19th and 20th
century history textbooks, by Frances Fitzgerald. In addition, supplementary
historical documents will be analyzed in class.

**IV. Texts: Primary and Secondary  
** Four book-length texts are required reading for the course. Copies of these
texts are available through the University Bookstore:  
A. Benjamin Franklin, The Autobiography (New York: Vintage, 1990 [ca. 1789]).  
B. Carl Kaestle, Pillars of the Republic (Hill and Wang, 1983).  
C. John Dewey, The School and Society (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1990).  
D. Bryce Nelson, Good Schools (Seattle: University of Washington, 1988).  
In addition, two article-length pieces and some excerpts from longer works are
required reading for the course. Copies of these articles and excerpts are
provided as part of a course packet available for purchase at the copy center
in the basement of the Communications Building. These readings include:  
E. Emma Willard, "A Plan for Improving Female Education"  
F. "Yale Report of 1828"  
G. W.E.B. DuBois, "Reconstruction and its Benefits"  
H. John Dewey, excerpts from Democracy and Education  
I. "Report of the Committee of Ten," 1893; "Cardinal Principles of Education,"
1918  
J. "Brown vs. the Board of Education" 1954  
Also part of the course packet are a number of documents and pieces of
evidence that we will examine in class. These readings are listed in section
VIII of this syllabus.



**V. Expectations: Reading and Analysis  
** Students are expected to come to each class, to be familiar with the
reading assigned for that class, and to have something thoughtful to say about
what they've read. As part of each class I will provide some historical
context for what we are reading and share some sample evidence of the
educational ideas and practices discussed in the reading. Students will then
be asked to apply the reading to the analysis of the historical evidence.  
Written assignments are also considered part of preparation for class
discussion. They are due at the beginning of the class session for which they
are assigned. There are four such essays assigned as part of the course.
Grades will be determined as follows: class attendance and participation, 15%;
autobiogrpahical essay, 15%; conceptual analysis, 20%; interpretive critique,
20%; and historical argument, 30%.

**VII. Assignments: Four Essays**

A. Essay 1: **Autobiographical essay  
** 1\. Assignment: Write a three-to-five page autobiographical essay in which
you describe a lesson you've learned from experience.

2\. Objectives: The point of this essay is for you to get in touch with your
own educational history, and thus to help you make sympathetic personal
connections with the lives and thoughts of the historical actors about whom
we'll be reading. In addition, the assignment is intended to introduce the
students in the course to the instructor.

3\. Discussion: Benjamin Franklin was devoted to education. In addition to
becoming a statesman, he organized numerous educational institutions and
became the leading American scientist of his day. And yet Franklin had almost
no formal schooling. Instead he developed his skills and ideas by learning
from experience and experiment. What was an important learning experience in
your life?

4\. Examples: Franklin's Autobiography.

5\. Standards of evaluation: Elegance of essay; seriousness of effort; clarity
in identifying and describing what has been learned from the experience.

6\. Due date: Jan. 13.

B. Essay 2: **Conceptual analysis  
** 1\. Assignment: Write a five page essay about the meaning of the common
school ideal.  
  
2\. Objectives: The point of this essay is to try to understand the common
school ideal in the terms of its time.  
  
3\. Discussion: The philosopher Thomas F. Green says that ideals are a matter
of imagining what could be better in what already exists. Another way of
thinking about ideals is as standards or principles of goodness that justify
acts aimed at change. From class you know that before the common school reform
movement began, schooling in the U.S. was decentralized and independently
funded. In rural areas, schools tended to be community institutions supported
by voluntary local effort. Most urban schools, by contrast, were the
businesses of independent teachers who earned their livings directly from
tuition. At the end of the common school reform movement, however, schools in
both rural and urban areas of the North were part of larger systems funded and
administered through the state. The common school ideal was the idea that
justified that change. What were the essential elements of that ideal? What
justified the new educational power and responsibilities of northern state
governments? What did people imagine would thereby be made better in the
schooling that existed?

4\. Examples: Sample statements of the common school ideal appear in the
"Reports of State Superintendents of Public Instruction" and the "Excerpts
from Common School Legislation" in your course packet.

5\. Standards of evaluation: Clarity of understanding of common school ideal;
grasp of issues of common school reform movement; insight into how such issues
shaped the meaning of the common school ideal.

6\. Due date: Feb. 3.  
C. Essay 3: **Interpretive Critique  
** 1\. Assignment: Write a five page critique of Bryce Nelson's _Good
Schools_.

2\. Objectives: The aim of this assignment is to critically examine the
interpretive framework used by Nelson to explain the history of progressive
reform in Seattle.

3\. Discussion: Bryce Nelson identifies two different phases in the history of
progressive school reform in Seattle: the first, running roughly from
1901-1917, he describes as the flowering of progressivism in Seattle schools.
The second, from 1919-1930, involved the undoing of progress in Nelson's
analysis. Write a five page essay in which you discuss Nelson's interpretation
of what happened to progressive reform in Seattle. Considering what you know
about progressivism from other sources, what comments and observations would
you make about Nelson's account of what happened in Seattle? What questions
would you raise?

4\. Examples: Consider Carl Kaestle's analysis of different interpretations of
common-school reform in his chapter, "Ins and Outs," _Pillars of the Republic_
, pp. 136-181.

5\. Standards of evaluation: Depth of analysis; quality of questions brought
to the material; grasp of Nelson's interpretation of events; insight into
possible alternative interpretations; evaluation and use of historical
evidence.

6\. Due date: Feb. 24.

D. Essay 4: **Historical argument  
** 1\. Assignment: Write a five page essay in response to one of these two
questions: a) _" Is the common school ideal still viable?"_ or b) _" Has the
academic ideal declined?"_

2\. Objectives: The aim of this assignment is to construct an argument
grounded in historical evidence and understanding.

3\. Discussion: Many of the issues surrounding common schooling and academic
programs historically are still salient at the end of the twentieth century.
For example, the issues surrounding common school reform in Massachusetts in
the 1840s and 50s were revisited in the battles over Boston desegregation in
the 1960s and 70s and are still at stake in the debates over equalizing school
funding and achieving educational equity today. Similarly, the questions
raised about academic ideals in the Yale Report of 1828 and again in the
Committee of Ten Report and the Cardinal Principals of Education are salient
still in debates over academic standards, tracking and common curricula
discussed by Frances Fitzgerald, and by David Angus and Jeffrey Mirel. Taking
into account these contemporary challenges to historical ideals, write a five
page essay in which you argue a position on one of the two above questions. Be
sure to use historical evidence to substantiate your claims.  
  
4\. Examples: Consider DuBois' historical argument about the viability of
civil rights ideals with respect to African Americans in "Reconstruction and
Its Benefits."

5\. Standards of evaluation: Coherence of argument; validity of historical
claims; use of evidence to substantiate claims; clarity of understanding of
common school ideal; grasp of the nature of twentieth century challenges to
that ideal.

6\. Due date: March 13.

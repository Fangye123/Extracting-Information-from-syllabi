**Course Description:**

Common-sensical understandings of disability have located it within the
medical sciences where explanations pertaining to biology predominate. Such
biological deterministic explanations have constructed the disabled individual
as deviant, stigmatized, incompetent, and marginal.  However, there have been
several theories within sociological work that have rescued disability from
its demeaning marginality and reconstructed more empowering definitions. Thus,
in this course we will examine these critiques and re-constructions as
produced through labeling theories, theories of deviance, theories of social
reconstruction as explained through symbolic interaction, and theories that
have argued for a sociology of acceptance.  In addition, we will also examine
how other sociological theories within feminism, marxism, anti-racism,
poststructuralism, and gay/lesbian studies have also addressed issues around
disability. Through this process we will attempt to link the construction of
disability with the constructions of race, class, gender, and sexual
orientation, particularly as they all pertain to the current context of
multiculturalism within the academy.  


**Course Objectives:**

On completion of this course, class participants should have a general
understanding of the debates within the sociology of disability including:

  * The many theoretical and interpretive frameworks that have been utilized to examine the social construction of disability.  
  * A basic conceptual map of the historical, social, political, and economic conditions that have produced the condition of disability and their inter-linkages with other oppressive practices of racism, classism, sexism, and homophobia.
  * Implications for practice in education and the human services. 

  
**Class Assignments:** ****

_A)_ The Response Paper: You are expected to submit 2 response papers (5-8
pages) where you will respond to a specific problem that we have been
grappling with during the course. In these reflective papers I encourage you
to first summarize what the central issues are, then elaborate on how your own
experiences and critical readings respond to these issues. Through this
exercise you will thus demonstrate your understanding of the issues discussed
and use the conceptual tools offered in class to critically analyze the social
realities that frame the lives of disabled people.

_B)_   Class Presentation: Each student will be expected to make a
presentation based on any one week's assigned readings and to generate a
discussion for part of the class. This exercise will give you some autonomy to
lead a discussion on issues that you deem critical to the course.

_C)_ The Final Paper: A final paper (15-20 pages) is due at the end of the
course on a topic of your choice.   Whatever your topic of choice, this paper
should reflect a critical understanding of the sociology of disability and its
relevance to issues you choose to discuss. In order to ensure that we are all
clear about the expectations of this paper, I would encourage you to submit a
very brief abstract of your paper for consideration. The abstract should
contain a brief description of the issue that you wish to explore, the
literature you would use to research it, and its significance to the field of
disability.

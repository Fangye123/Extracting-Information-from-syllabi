A study of the archaeological finds from the buried cities of Pompeii and
Herculaneum and the ways in which those finds illuminate the lives of the
ancient Romans. The course will cover urban design, public structures, houses
and villas, gardens, graffiti and dipinti, papyri, sculpture, wall paintings,
mosaics, and everyday objects. An economic, social, and intellectual context
for the remains of the material culture of these cities on the Bay of Naples
will be developed from readings in Roman history and Latin literature,
including Cicero, Horace, Ovid, Seneca, Petronius, Statius, and Pliny.

III.A.2 (natural sciences).`

>>

>> `Scope:`

>>

>> `This course presents an interdisciplinary introduction to the character
and aims of 20th century science, current theories and knowledge, and the role
of science and technology in contemporary society.`  
>  
>>

>> `Required Texts:`

>>

>> `_Uncommon Sense: The Heretical Nature of Science_ , Alan Cromer (Oxford
University Press, 1993)`

>> `All texts are available at The Little Professor bookstore on Placentia
Avenue.`  
>

>> `Office Hours and Contact Information:`

>>

>> `I will hold one office hour at 10 AM Tuesday in McCarthy Hall Room 600.
Additional office hours are by appointment. Please call me at (714) 278-4828
to arrange for an office hour or telephone consultation. I also can answer
questions sent to me via email (mshapiro@fullerton.edu).`  
>

>> `Grading:`

>>

>> `Grades will be based on three midterm exams and a term paper. A list of
suggested term paper topics will be distributed approximately midway through
the semester, but you also may propose your own topic related to the subject
matter of the course. Each of the three midterm exams will be worth 20% of the
final grade. The term paper will be worth 30% of the final grade. The
remaining 10% of the grade will be based on your class participation.`

>> `Course Overview:`

>>

>> `The scope of this course is very broad; and, obviously in the span of a
single semester we cannot hope to examine all of the intricacies of 20th
century science. Instead, we will concentrate on three broad areas and several
key ideas. Our first area of study will focus on how science came to be. The
methodology used to acquire knowledge in the sciences is unique. For a theory
to be termed "scientific" it must meet two criteria. First the theory must be
internally consistent. In other words, it must have no internal
contradictions. This, however, is not sufficient. The theory also must be
testable. This implies that the theory must make predictions about the
external world that can be examined objectively. During the first part of the
course we will study how these notions of scientific thought arose.`

>>

>> `The remainder of the course will be devoted to examining some of the key
discoveries of the modern natural sciences. First we will look briefly at the
key ideas of classical physics. Then we will examine in more detail the
transforming theories of 20th century physics - relativity and quantum
mechanics. Much of modern technology has its basis in these physical
theories.`

>>

>> `Finally, we will study the central concept of modern biological science -
evolutionary theory.`  
>

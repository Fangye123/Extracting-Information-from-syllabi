> _The only way in which a human being can make some approach to knowing the
whole of a subject is by hearing what can be said about it by persons of every
variety of opinion, and studying all the modes in which it can be looked at by
every character of mind. No wise man ever acquired his wisdom in any mode but
this; nor is it in the nature of the human intellect to becomes wise in any
other manner._

> **Course Objectives  
>  ** This course is intended to present you with an in depth look at selected
topics in United States history from its human origins to 1877. The history
presented in this class will introduce you to the places, ideas and people
that make up our past. The approach is multicultural and interdisciplinary.
Rather than a broad survey of names, places and dates, we will explore and
discuss the ideas, conclusions and controversies in history.

>

> This course supports the goals set forth in the National Standards for
History. The standards can be accessed at:  
>  http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/nchs/standards/

>

> **Chronological thinking,** developing a beginning sense of historical time-
past, present, and future-in order to identify the temporal sequence in which
events occurred, measure calendar time, interpret and create time lines, and
explain patterns of historical continuity and change.

>

> **Historical comprehension** , including the ability to listen to and read
historical stories and narratives with understanding, to identify the basic
elements of the narrative or story structure (the characters, situation,
sequence of events, their causes, and their outcome); and to develop the
ability to describe the past through the eyes and experiences of those who
were there, as revealed through their literature, art, artifacts, and other
records of their time.

>

> **Historical analysis and interpretation** , including the ability to
compare and contrast different experiences, beliefs, motives, traditions,
hopes, and fears of people from various groups and backgrounds, and at various
times in the past and present; to analyze how these differing motives,
interests, beliefs, hopes, and fears influenced people's behaviors; to compare
the different perspectives included in different stories about historical
people and events; to compare historical fiction and documentary sources about
a particular era or event; and to analyze the historical accuracy of fictional
accounts.

>

> **Historical research capabilities,** including the ability to formulate
historical questions from encounters with historical documents, artifacts,
photos, visits to historical sites, and eyewitness accounts; to acquire
information concerning the historical time and place where the artifact,
document, or other record was created; and to construct a historical narrative
or story concerning it.

>

> **Historical issues-analysis and decision-making** , including the ability
to identify problems that people confronted in historical literature, the
local community, and the state; to analyze the various interests and points of
view of people caught up in these situations; to evaluate alternative
proposals for dealing with the problem(s); and to analyze whether the
decisions reached or the actions taken were good ones and why.

>

> **Required Texts and Readings  
>  ** The following **texts** are required:  
>  Zinn, Howard. **A People's History of the United States  
>  ** Loewen, James **Lies My History Teacher Told Me  
>  ** Rampolla, Mary Lynn, **A Pocket Guide to Writing in History  
>  ** These books can be purchased at the campus book store (highest price),
local book shops and also used copies at Amazon.com and half.com and other
book sites.

>

> The **readings** (except where noted) are available on Electronic Course
Reserves through the library's website. Most of the readings are also on Book
Reserve with a two hour checkout limit. It is your responsibility to
familiarize yourself with accessing, downloading and printing and/or copying
the readings.

>

>  
>

> **Student Requirements**

>

> Students are required to come to class prepared; assigned readings
completed, assignments completed on time. This course focuses on developing
your analytical, research and writing skills. This requires a commitment from
you in both time and effort. How much time and how much effort you are willing
to devote to this class is your decision and will reflect in your final grade.
It is recommended that you devote at least four to five hours per week on the
readings and more for examinations. When you come to class you should be
prepared to take notes, listen to the instructor and your colleagues and be
prepared to discuss the topics of the day.

>

> In order for our class time to be most productive it is essential that you
follow these rules of classroom etiquette:  
>  1\. Be on time.  
>  2\. Don't talk in class.  
>  3\. Turn off cell phones.  
>  4\. Do not sleep in class.  
>  Failing to abide by these rules will most likely result in an embarrassing
situation for you.  
>  
>  **Assessment and Grades**

>

> 1\. 10 minute presentation 20 points  
>  2\. Midterm Exam 50 points  
>  3\. Research Essay 100 points  
>  4\. Final exam 50 points  
>  5\. Attendance and Participation 20 points

>

> **Class Presentation  
>  ** Each student is required to make a ten minute presentation in class
explaining one of the major topics in the course. The focus of this
presentation should be for a class of fifth or sixth grade students. In your
presentation you should try to  
>  1\. Explain the material simply and clearly.  
>  2\. Give an example to illustrate the topic.  
>  3\. Use some visual material.  
>  4\. If time allows suggest an interactive activity.  
>  Often connecting the topic to a current event is a way of quickly
familiarizing students with a topic by making it relevant.

>

> One week after your presentation you will submit a one page self-evaluation
critiquing what aspects of your presentation worked and which you would do
differently if presented the chance. You will be evaluated based on your
presentation and your self-evaluation.

>

> **Midterm Exam Friday March 15  
>  ** A one hour exam that will focus on the material presented in the first
half of the course.

>

> **Research Essay Due April 12 (Sections 1, 2, 3,) and april 15 (Section 4
Mon.)  
>  ** The research essay will 7-8 pages long and will focuses on one of the
major topics in this class. This paper will include an outline, endnotes and
an annotated bibliography. This essay is a research essay and will be used to
assess your basic writing and research skills. The highest standards of
grammar and spelling will be applied. We will discuss the research paper
during Week 2. A handout will be available.

>

> **Final Exam  
>  ** This exam will focus on the material presented since the midterm exam.

>

> **Attendance and Participation  
>  ** I will take attendance and points will be deducted for absences. Coming
to class unprepared and unwilling to discuss the material is also grounds for
losing points. If you want to receive full credit for this portion of your
grade you must make attempts to participate in class discussions.

>

>  
>

> **Grades  
>  ** Having served as a teacher in the UC, Cal State and various CC
districts, I find that most students suffer from grade inflation. **Grade
inflation ends here!** In this instructor's classroom an "A" is awarded for
truly superior work, consistently throughout the semester. It is a grade given
for excellence in academic achievement. The letter grade of "B" is awarded for
above average work, beyond "doing the job." The letter grade "C" is for
average work, fulfilling adequately all of the assigned work and earning
adequate points on exams and quizzes. The letter grade "D" is for less than
average work, but earning enough points to pass the course and finally an "F"
is given for failing to earn the points necessary for passing.

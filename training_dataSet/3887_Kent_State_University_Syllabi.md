Course Description: This course explores the changing and sometimes
contentious relationship between society and thought in the United States from
1790 to 1876. Through the analysis of a wide variety of historical evidence
(including philosophical, scientific and social treatises, literary texts, and
material/visual culture) and the contextual consideration of secondary
sources, students will acquire skills in historical analysis and critical
interpretation, as well as a thorough grounding in the implications of
authorship and readership that reveal the "invisible" boundaries recoverable
through examination of theories of race, ethnicity, gender, and class. This
course fulfills the undergraduate diversity requirement, and is a writing
intensive class.  
  
Course Requirements:  
Undergraduate Students:  
Students are expected to be prepared for each class and to participate fully
in class discussion (10%).

November (30%).  
  
The research requirement of this course consists of the components of a 10-15
page typewritten essay on a topic chosen by the student and approved by the
instructor. The essay could take several forms, historiographical, research,
exhibition with rationale, intellectual or cultural biography, analysis of a
text, painting, or artifact. No matter the approach or evidence, the essay
should be focussed and relate to the larger themes of the course.   The
components are:  
A 1-2 page typed proposal, with a 1-page bibliography of primary and secondary
sources, is due on or before 29 September (10%).  
    A rough draft of the essay is due on or before 12 November (20%).

# Syllabus

**Description**

     This course is designed to teach the student the history of the materials and technology used to create artifacts of textile and paper. The origin of these organic materials and their fabrication into museum objects will be studied.
      

**Aim & Learning Outcomes**

    

**Aim:**

     To enable the students to understand the history and development of technology and material culture.
**Learning Outcomes:**

     Students will have demonstrated the ability to: 

    know the origins, sources, processing, products, manufacture, construction methods, fabrication and design of the materials and objects made of textile and paper.
    know the origins, history and development of the technologies and manufacturing processes of objects made of textile and paper.
    research objects, materials and technologies of textile and paper using a variety of media and methods.
      

**Course Format**

     This course is one of four courses listed in the "super module" of Conservation and Material Science I. Courses in this frame work are linked tightly together, are interdependent to each other, and are foundation courses for the program.
    This course will consist of 1 hour of scheduled lecture per week. Lecture time may be subject to occasional adjustment in order to fit in with field trips, community based projects, group projects or guest lectures and/or workshops. Students are asked to remain flexible during the delivery of this course content.
    Additional time outside of scheduled class will be required for independent study.

**Course Policies**

     Students must complete all course assignments in order to receive a passing grade.
    The CCM Program has adopted the attached policy on late assignments. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day. Exceptions may be granted due to circumstances beyond the student's control, provided that the student contacts the instructor promptly upon return to the College to discuss alternate arrangements.
      

**Academic Policies**

    

**1\. Presentation**

     Written assignments must be: 

    typed or word-processed
    double spaced
    proofed for spelling and grammatical errors
    enclosed with a single cover sheet which includes student name, title of the assignment and date of submission
    stapled in the top left hand corner (unbound)
    include a bibliography (where appropriate)
    use a recognized method of citation (eg. MLA or Chicago)
**2\. Re-writes**

     Faculty may request a re-write of a submission if the criteria for assessment have not been met.
    Late penalties will apply if the assignment is not re-submitted the following day.
**3\. Penalties for Late Submissions**

     Completion of Term Work
    All assignments must be completed in order for students to achieve a passing grade. 

**Late Assignments**

     Late assignments receive the following penalty:
    Marks will be deducted at the rate of 10% per day for three days after which assignments are marked at zero.
    Faculty are not obliged to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero.
**Oral Presentations**

     Oral presentations and/or practical test or projects for evaluation must be delivered on the day scheduled. A "no show" will be graded at zero, unless adequate explanation is provided.
**4\. Academic Integrity**

     Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity and the college has a strict policy on this issue (see Academic Regulations).
    It is a student's responsibility to ensure that all written submissions include an appropriate method of in text citation as well as an accompanying bibliography.
    Seminar and oral presentations should be supported by a bibliography and sources should be referred to during the presentation.
**5\. Make-up Tests**

     In valid circumstances (ill-health, personal crisis), a student may be given a make-up test to compensate for one missed in class-time. Students must contact the instructor within seven days of the original test in order to request a make-up.
**6\. Extensions & GDFS**

    An extension may be granted to an individual student based on need and circumstance. Medical grounds should be substantiated.
    The revised due date will be recorded and signed by both parties.
    The entire class may be given an extension, at the discretion of faculty.
    Incomplete a Grade Deferred marks at the end of the semester must be negotiated between student and faculty (see Academic Regulations). Note: these are a privilege to be granted under special circumstances, not used in order to compensate for poor planning.

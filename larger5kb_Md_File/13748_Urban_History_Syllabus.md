**[CLICK HERE TO SEE THE REVIEW SHEET](urfinal.html)**  
---  
**Course Objectives:**

> To study the ways in which different cultural groups have adjusted to the
social, economic, and spatial changes in American cities. The course is also
intended to help students improve their skills in reading historical sources
and writing essays.

**Required Reading:**

> Students are expected to read five books. The books are available for
purchase at the Co-op.

>

> 1) Alan Dawley, _Class and Community_  
>  2) [Margaret Marsh, _Suburban
Lives_](http://VM.UCONN.EDU/~PBALDWIN/MARSH.HTML)  
>  3) Jacob Riis, _How the Other Half Lives_  
>  4) Kathy Peiss, _Cheap Amusements_

>

> 5) Choose one of the following:

>

>> a) Elijah Anderson, _Streetwise_  
>  b) Michael Sorkin, ed., _Variations on a Theme Park_

  **Assignments and Grading:**

> Students will submit at least two of the four assigned book reviews.
Students who write three reviews will have the lowest grade dropped. Students
will submit two papers based in part on primary source materials. One of these
papers will examine Jacob Riis's _How the Other Half Lives_. The other paper
will be chosen from among five "electives." The course will conclude with a
cumulative final examination.

|  How your grade will be calculated  
---  
**Assignment** | **Weight  **  
Two Book Reviews (4-5 pages)  | 20% each  
Riis Paper (4-5 pages)  | 20%  
Elective Paper (4-5 pages) | 20%  
Final Exam  | 20%  
Class Participation  | Bonus  
  
  
  **Requirements and Expectations:**

> 1) All students are required to submit their written work on time. Students
who encounter an emergency that prevents them from submitting a paper on time
are required to discuss the matter with me in advance, if at all possible, or
to notify me by voice mail (486-3854). Students who submit late work without
advance permission will be penalized. For each weekday that a paper is late,
the grade will be reduced by a third of a grade (for instance from an A- to a
B+). No papers will be accepted more than a week late without prior
arrangement.

> 2) Daily attendance is strongly encouraged. Students are expected to keep up
with the material presented in class regardless of whether they miss a day. If
you know ahead of time that you will be absent, it is a good idea to arrange
with someone else to take notes.

> 3) Students are expected to participate regularly, actively, and
constructively in class discussions. Students will receive extra credit for
class participation only if they express informed judgments, pose questions,
and respond to other students' comments. Students who rarely speak, or who
show a lack of familiarity with the material, will not receive any credit.

> 4) Punctuality is important and expected. Chronic tardiness carries dire
consequences, as does leaving before the end of class without notifying me in
advance. Whenever a student must arrive late or leave early, she or he should
do so as unobtrusively as possible.

> 5) Drinks are OK, but no eating in class.

> 6) Students are expected to behave themselves in a way that shows courtesy
to the instructors and to fellow students. They are expected to be attentive
and respectful. Language or behavior that demeans or harasses other students
will not be tolerated; this includes sexual harassment.

>

> 7) [Plagiarism](http://VM.UCONN.EDU/%7EPBALDWIN/cheat.html) and cheating
will not be tolerated.  Plagiarism is the use of the ideas, organization, or
words of another writer without giving proper credit. Students must produce
their own, original work for this course. All students must pass the
plagiarism test before submitting any written work. Any student found to have
committed a serious act of plagiarism will fail the course. This rule is
supported by the policy on academic integrity in the University of
Connecticut's student code. I take this requirement very seriously and I
actively hunt for plagiarism. If I catch you, I will not care about any
excuses you may have. Don't plagiarize! It's not worth the risk.

>

>> Here is the policy on academic integrity in the University of Connecticut's
student code:

>>

>>    A fundamental tenet of all educational institutions is academic honesty;
academic work depends upon respect for and acknowledgement of the research and
ideas of others. Misrepresenting someone else's work as one's own is a serious
offense in any academic setting and it will not be condoned.  
>    Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, providing or
receiving assistance in a manner not authorized by the instructor in the
creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation (e.g. papers,
projects, and examinations); any attempt to influence improperly (e.g.
bribery, threats) any member of the faculty, staff, or administration of the
University in any matter pertaining to academics or research; presenting, as
one's own, the ideas or words of another for academic evaluation; doing
unauthorized academic work for which another person will receive credit or be
evaluated; and presenting the same or substantially the same papers or
projects in two or more courses without the explicit permission of the
instructors involved.  
>   A student who knowingly assists another student in committing an act of
academic misconduct shall be equally accountable for the violation, and shall
be subject to the sanctions and other remedies described in The Student Code.

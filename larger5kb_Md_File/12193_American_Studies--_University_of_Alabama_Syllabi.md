####  THE INVENTION OF HETEROSEXUALITY

HISTORY 103D

**Course Description**

       If the notion of homosexuality, according to Michel Foucault, did not exist before the late 19th century, then neither did heterosexuality--which might suggest that our concepts of sexual "normality" and "deviance" are both more recent and less stable than we'd like. This course will trace the careers of these concepts: how have Americans understood, fought against, and articulated them throughout the 20th century? What kinds of identities have they claimed, when, and how? What are the social, cultural, and political ramifications of doing so?

Topics to be covered include the "crisis of masculinity," the rise of the "new
woman," and the flourishing of gay culture around the turn of the century; the
social effects of World War II and the consequent sexual conservatism of the
50s; sexual liberation and gay and lesbian culture both before and after
Stonewall; AIDS, the men's movement, and contemporary expressions of sexual
and cultural anxiety. In addition to vigorous participation in discussion,
students will contribute an oral presentation, two book reviews, and a 15-20
page final paper.

**Course Assignments**  

1.  Your primary assignment in this class is careful reading of the material and preparation for discussion each week.  This is not a lecture class, nor do I expect you to gain "mastery" of this subject.  But I do expect you to develop a critical vocabulary, to think seriously and honestly about the issues we will cover, and to be talkative and engaged in class each week. 

2.  Two (2) book reviews, of 5-7 pages in length each.  You must choose books from two different sections of the course.  (The list I have provided on the syllabus is only to get you started.  You are free to--in fact, I encourage you to--pursue a topic of your own interest, but please check it with me first.)  Reviews are due, at the LATEST, on the day we complete that section (that is, Feb. 13, Mar. 12, and/or Apr. 30), though of course you are free to hand them in earlier.  These are intended to be short critical essays in which you evaluate this book: what is its argument? does it make sense? what does it do well, and what poorly? how does the course material illuminate it, and vice versa?  If you are reading a novel, how does it compare with historical accounts of the same period? how do the feelings and attitudes it conveys illuminate and/or disprove historians' arguments? how do the novelist's characters define themselves? what kinds of "truth" does it offer? 

3.  One in-class presentation.  A short oral presentation of 15-20 minutes in which you discuss the week's reading, point out what seem to you its particular strengths and weaknesses, and suggest some questions and themes for discussion. 

4.  Final Paper:  Due Apr. 30.  I'm open to topics on this one.  You may, if you choose, write a 15-20 page research paper.  Or you may read more on a topic that has particularly interested you, or follow up on some aspect of discussion that we did not have time to pursue in detail during class.  The potential topics are unlimited.  What I require is that you develop your ideas with me in some depth before you begin to read.  We will discuss this further as the term continues. 

GRADING PROCEDURE: final paper 40%, book reviews & participation 30% each.  I
do not calculate grades through strict mathematics, however, nor do I think of
myself as an Organic Chemistry teacher: I grade on improvement, effort, and
interest, so please don't obsess over the percentages.

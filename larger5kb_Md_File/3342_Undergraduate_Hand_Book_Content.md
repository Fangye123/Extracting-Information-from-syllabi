****The Sociology Undergraduate Handbook

* * *

**Welcome to the Department of Sociology at UCSD**  
We hope that this handbook will be a useful complement to the general catalog.
Although most information for your first year will come from the academic
advisers in your college, feel free to come by the sociology department for
further counseling on your major. The Department of Sociology provides a
challenging curriculum, which offers you a superior liberal arts education and
a bright future.

**A Letter from the Chair of the Department of Sociology**  
Sociology is the study of societies: their composition, organization, culture,
and development. At the micro level, sociologists do research on the effects
of social interaction and networks on individual and collective behavior,
beliefs, and cognition. At the macro level, sociology has at least three major
foci. The first is the study of the organization, culture, and development of
collectivities (social classes, groups based on gender, ethnicity, or
religion; national and transnational communities). This includes the causes
and consequences of collective action by groups, movements, and organizations.
The second is institutions (economic, political, and cultural): How they are
formed and sustained, how they interact, how they affect individual and
collective action, and how they change. Finally, sociologists study national
societies (their structure, institutions, and culture), and the international
social order. This includes the analysis of national and international social
change, and processes of reform and revolution.

The Department of Sociology at UCSD is unique in that most of our faculty work
in three fields: comparative-historical sociology, the sociology of culture,
and the sociology of science. In addition, the department offers basic
training in social theory, and quantitative and qualitative methodologies. A
further peculiarity of this department is that a large proportion of its
members are engaged in the study of foreign countries: their institutions,
culture, interactions with other nations, development, and change. UCSD
sociologists do research not only on the United States, but also on societies
in Africa, Latin America, East Asia, Western and Eastern Europe, and the
Middle East. For this reason, the department has strong ties with all the area
studies and international studies centers at UCSD.

A major in sociology will offer a rigorous preparation to students planning
graduate work in sociology, political science, and other social and behavioral
sciences. In addition, a sociological education is an excellent background for
professional training in law, medicine, business, education, and social work.
Finally, a major in sociology provides a solid liberal education, and it is an
ideal choice for undergraduates considering careers in the private sector,
government, and non-profit organizations.

I invite students interested in pursuing a major or minor in sociology to meet
our undergraduate coordinator, and get more specific information and advice on
requirements, courses, and departmental activities in general.

**What is Sociology?**  
Sociology is the study of society: its composition, organization, culture, and
development. It combines scientific methods with humanistic perspectives,
integrating the findings of economics, political science, psychology, and
history.

Return to top

* * *

**Why Sociology?**  
Sociology is a valuable major for students who want to enter law, medicine,
architecture, business, or politics. It also provides a solid liberal arts
education for students who plan careers in education, criminal justice, public
health, urban planning, social welfare, counseling, public administration,
international relations, or market research.

For students who wish to pursue graduate study in the social sciences for
careers in teaching or scholarly research, an undergraduate degree from the
Department of Sociology will provide a thorough grounding in recent
theoretical and methodological advances in the discipline. Whatever your
career choice, the study of sociology can help you cultivate a critical
awareness of society.

**The Sociology Major at UCSD  
** This department has developed an innovative curriculum, building on the
strengths of our faculty and the breadth of their knowledge. Many courses are
taught examining the historical development of societies in diverse regions
across the globe: East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Eastern and
Western Europe, and Africa. This international focus allows us to consider the
grand social transformations, which are underway on a global scale. A number
of courses consider the cultural dimensions of social life, such as religion,
popular culture, and film. A strong feature of our curriculum is the study of
science and technology. Other courses taught include topics such as education,
gender, health and illness, race and ethnic relations, nationalism, and
protest movements. The subject matter of sociology courses is quite diverse,
yet interrelated by the concern across a number of different fields in the
character of inequalities in society and the varying processes of
modernization.

* * *

**The Department**  
At UCSD, the Department of Sociology may have the most extensive and
comprehensive program of comparative and historical sociology in the country.
The international emphasis is expressed in the faculty's teaching commitment
to the Graduate School of International Relations  & Pacific Studies, the
Science Studies Program, as well as Eleanor Roosevelt College, which is
oriented around international studies. In addition, the department has strong,
nationally recognized programs in the sociology of culture and in science
studies. The sociology of inequality (on the basis of class, gender, and race)
is also a central research and teaching field for many faculty members.
Students may also wish to participate in research projects or the honors
program offered by the department.

**Declaration or Change of Major**  
File an _Undergraduate Change of Major Request_ form with the Registrar's
Office. Forms are available in the Department of Sociology or in the
Registrar's Office. This form will allow the sociology undergraduate
coordinator to receive transcripts each quarter and track each sociology
student's progress in the major. Whenever students have questions about
program requirements or courses still needed to fulfill the major, the
department will have this information available including copies of petitions
and other relevant paperwork.

**Requirements for the Sociology Major**  
**A "C-" or better must be earned on all courses to be used for the sociology
major, and all courses must be taken for a letter grade.** The exception, for
courses that may only be taken P/NP, is that only one is allowed for the
major. The courses that can only be taken P/NP are Soc/E 197, 198, and/or 199.  
  
**Lower-Division Courses**  
Lower-division sociology courses provide an excellent background and strong
foundation on which to build your studies. Four lower-division sociology
courses are required: Soc/L 1A, 1B, 20, and 60. For each of these courses
students must attend a lecture and a discussion section.  
  
Soc/L 1A and 1B form an introductory sequence to the discipline of sociology.
Introducing the organizing themes and ideas, empirical concerns, and
analytical approaches of sociology. It is strongly recommended that Soc/L 1A
and 1B are taken before taking upper-division courses. Soc/L 20 provides an
introduction to theories of social change and prepares students for
comparative-historical sociology. (Eleanor Roosevelt College students may
substitute MMW5 for the Soc/L 20 requirement.) Soc/L 60 introduces students to
fundamental principles of social research design: How to pose a sociological
question, formulate an appropriate research design, and evaluate empirical
evidence.

**Upper-Division Courses**  
Upper-division sociology courses are divided into four CLUSTERS, or areas of
sociology: **CLUSTER A** Theory and Method, **CLUSTER B** Culture, Language,
and Social Interaction, **CLUSTER C** Organizations and Institutions,
**CLUSTER D** Comparative and Historical.

A total of twelve upper-division courses are required to complete a sociology
major. From cluster A, two courses are required (please refer to the theory
and method requirements listed below), and one course each from cluster B, C,
and D. This will give students a total of five courses towards the major and
the remaining seven courses, referred to as electives, can be taken from any
of the cluster groups.

**Theory Requirement:** Soc/A 100, _Classical Sociological Theory,_ is a
required course for all sociology majors. This is an important course that
will provide a strong theoretical foundation to prepare students for other
upper-division course work. We strongly recommend that students take it early
in their junior year, after the lower-division sociology courses have been
completed.

**Method Requirement:** The sociology major requires one  "methods" course.
The courses in the method area are numbered Soc/A 103M, and Soc/A 104 to Soc/A
109S, and include such topics as: Field Methods, Ethnographic Film, Computer
Application of Data Management, Comparative/Historical Methods, and Survey
Research and Design.

**Electives:** After students have taken Soc/A 100, a method course, and a
cluster b, c, and d course, they will have seven upper-division courses
remaining to complete the major requirements. It is not required that these
remaining electives be in only one cluster or area of sociology, but as
students choose courses of interest to them, the courses may end up falling
naturally into one area. It is also important to include courses that will
assist with your career plans after graduation. Method courses help acquire
marketable skills, social psychology, and social interaction courses help
students planning to go into social service work, while education courses help
those planning to go into teaching.

One elective course can be satisfied with a four-unit Independent Study (Soc/E
199) course. Or, if interested in conducting a research project with a group
of students, consult with a professor and sign up for a Group Independent
Study (Soc/E 198). Another choice, with department permission, would be to
take an Internship (AIP 197). Because these courses are taken on pass/no pass
basis, remember that only one can be used toward the sociology major. Refer to
additional information on internships and special studies courses on pages 13
and 14.

Courses from other disciplines that have sociological relevance may also be
petitioned for the major. These courses are primarily approved for elective
credit, rather than for a specific cluster requirement, and no more than two
upper-division courses from outside the major will be accepted.

**Course Prerequisites:**

  * Soc/L 90 -- a seminar limited to freshmen
  * Soc/A 104 -- sociology majors only
  * Soc/A 105 -- must have taken Soc/L 1A, 1B, or have the consent of the instructor
  * Soc/E 190 -- a seminar for seniors
  * Soc/E 196A-B -- for students accepted into the Sociology Honors Program (See page 12)
  * Soc/E 197-- must have a 3.5 GPA, must have received an "A" in Soc/A 104, and have the consent of the instructor
  * Soc/E 198 and 199 -- must have at least a 2.5 GPA, must be at least a junior, and must receive departmental approval
  * All upper-division courses -- upper-division standing is required
  * Sociology also offers several foreign language discussion sections, which are available to interested students, who are enrolled concurrently in the corresponding sociology course  

Return to top

* * *

**Declaration of Minor**  
A minor in sociology consists of any two lower-division sociology courses and
any five upper-division sociology courses, excluding Soc/E 197, Soc/E 198, and
Soc/E 199. A grade of  "C-" or better is required in courses used for the
minor. A grade of P/NP is not acceptable; **courses for the minor must be
taken for a letter grade.** Transfer courses may be used to satisfy a portion
of your minor in sociology with permission of the director of undergraduate
studies.

An Undergraduate Declaration of Minor Form, available from the Registrar, your
college advising office, or from the sociology department, should be given to
the undergraduate coordinator for departmental approval.

**Tracking Your Progress**  
**Review of Requirements for the Major**  
Seven upper-division electives are needed in addition to fulfilling Cluster A
(two courses), Cluster B (one course), Cluster C (one course), and Cluster D
(one course). This will give you a total of twelve upper-division courses for
the major. At the lower-division level you need Soc/L 1A, Soc/L 1B, Soc/L 20,
and Soc/L 60.

This page will help you track your progress in the major. It is recommended
that you meet with the staff undergraduate coordinator on a regular basis for
verification of your progress.

**Transferring Credits**  
Courses from other institutions may count toward the major if there is an
equivalent course at UCSD, or if the course content is at a level equivalent
to an offering in the Department of Sociology. Any course taken outside of the
sociology department at UCSD must be petitioned to count toward the  
sociology major, with the exception of those lower-division courses listed on
the chart below. While it is not necessary to petition the courses listed
below, students should notify the undergraduate coordinator so that she can
document their file. Lower-division courses taken at a college that is not
listed below must be petitioned with a copy of the course syllabus attached.

**Petitions**  
There are two parts to the petitioning process. The Undergraduate Student
Petition must be completed in full. Petitions are available from the sociology
department, from your college office, or from the Registrar's Office. The
department has a second form, 'Sociology Department's Supplementary Petition
for Acceptance of Transfer Credit,' that must also be completed. This second
form is available only in the sociology main office. The second sheet will ask
for more in-depth information regarding the course(s) you wish to petition
(course description, books used, coursework required, etc.). You must receive
a grade of 'C-' or better in the class to have it count toward your major.
Complete both forms and submit them to the staff undergraduate coordinator.
Your petition will then be reviewed by the director of undergraduate studies
and circulated to the department chair, your provost office, and the registrar
for approval. You may verify the status of this petition with your college
office two to three weeks after you submit the petition.

It is important that you state in the petition the course or cluster you are
attempting to satisfy with your petition request. Please be as specific as
possible and submit one petition for each course you are requesting. If you
have any questions about course equivalency, it is recommended that you meet
with the staff undergraduate coordinator or the director of undergraduate
studies.

**Note:** If the same course is listed above as an equivalent for two UCSD
courses, this does not mean you can use this course to satisfy two courses!
Instead, you may use it to satisfy one course requirement for the sociology
department at UCSD.

**Education Abroad Programs (EAP)**  
All courses taken through EAP are considered UC courses for which UC credit is
earned and grades are directly recorded on the transcript and are factored
into your UCSD overall GPA. However, the Department of Sociology independently
determines which courses may be applied to the major. This decision is made in
response to a petition submitted after students return.

**Opportunities Abroad Programs (OAP)**  
In the case of course work completed through OAP, the UCSD Admissions Office
is responsible for decisions on the transfer of credits into UCSD and onto the
UCSD academic record (transcripts). Credits transferred through the
Opportunities Abroad Program appear on UCSD transcripts with course titles and
units transferred. Grades from OAP courses will appear on the transcript from
the institution where the work was completed, but these grades are not
recorded on the UCSD transcript, nor are they factored into the cumulative
UCSD grade-point average (GPA). As in the case of EAP courses, the Department
of Sociology will decide independently, on petitions to accept credits toward
the major after the admissions officer's acceptance of course units.

**Petitioning Course Work Completed Abroad (EAP/OAP)**  
To apply course work completed abroad toward a major or minor in sociology,
students must submit a petition to the department after their return. The
petition should include: name of the study center or university where course
work was completed, department course number and course title, and number and
level (upper- or lower-division) of credits granted at UCSD through admissions
or EAP. Students should attach a copy of the syllabus and copies of exams or
papers, especially if there is any doubt about the difficulty of the course or
its sociological content.

Students are strongly advised to retain the syllabi, course papers,
examinations, and all other paperwork from courses taken abroad. These
materials may be useful after you return to facilitate the admissions
officer's decision about credit transfers (in the case of OAP programs), as
well as departmental approval of courses toward the major for EAP and OAP
students. The same materials may help resolve any debates that might arise in
the department over possible duplication in course content.

_If you are planning to use credits earned abroad toward your major or toward
graduation, you are strongly encouraged to confirm before you go abroad, with
the Admissions Office (in the case of OAP programs) and the department, that
the courses you plan to take are likely to be accepted._

**Maximum Transfer Credits**  
Sociology majors may, with permission obtained through student petitions, take
up to four required courses for the major while abroad. There is considerable
flexibility on the sociology courses that the department will accept. Students
are encouraged to take courses that have a sociological approach, not simply
those that are just about sociology. The department also does not make the
decision on a simple  "four units earned equal one course" formula. In
general, most yearlong courses are more nearly equivalent to two 'four-unit'
courses than to three 'four-unit' courses (even when year-long courses appear
on transcripts as twelve quarter units). Semester courses, which transfer onto
the transcript as six-unit courses, do not necessarily become the equivalent
of one and a half UCSD sociology courses. More typically, it's one course
equivalent per semester course taken.

* * *

**Add/Drop Procedures for Sociology Courses**  
Weeks one and two are the designated Add/Drop period, every quarter. Students
may continue to use the Web-Reg system during these two weeks to drop courses.
Submitting a drop card to the Registrar's Office is another option for
dropping courses. A signature or department stamp is not required for dropping
sociology courses. Students are able to add classes using Web-Reg as long as
space is available. Once a class is full, an add/drop card, that has been
signed by the professor must be taken to the Registrar's Office. To obtain the
professor's signature on your add/drop card, attend the class and let the
instructor know that you want to add the class. If the professor will allow
you to add the class, be sure to obtain his/her signature on your add/drop
card. Don't forget to take the card to the Registrar's Office to be officially
enrolled in the course. It might also be possible to obtain the professor's
signature by going to his/her office during posted office hours. Graduating
seniors should inform the professor if the course is needed to complete
graduation requirements.

**Section - Add/Drop**  
The procedure for adding/dropping sections is the same as described above with
the following change - prior to getting your professor's signature on your
add/drop card you need to have the approval of the section TA. Attend the
section that you would like to add and ask the TA if there is room for you. If
there is room, the TA will sign a blue slip, which must be taken to the
professor. After checking the signed blue slip, the professor will sign your
add/drop card. If the section you want is already filled, try to work another
section into your schedule. Continue to attend the lecture and a section. By
the second week of the quarter, there are usually more openings in all
sections and classes.

**Section - Switching**  
**IMPORTANT: DO NOT SIGN UP FOR ONE SECTION AND ATTEND ANOTHER.** If you are
enrolled in a sociology course that requires a discussion section, you must
attend the section you signed up for. Use the add/drop period to officially
switch sections, if there doesn't appear to be room for you, keep checking
back. Space may be available by the end of the second week, but after the
add/drop period, you must attend the section you are officially enrolled in.
If you attend another section, you may find yourself without a grade at the
end of the quarter.

Return to top

* * *

**Papers, Exams, Finals& Grades**  
**Papers**  
All course work should be submitted to your professor, on time and during the
scheduled class time. If this is not possible, it can be turned in at the
Department of Sociology main office. Papers turned in at the main office must
have the professor's name on them, and they need to be date stamped. It is
highly recommended that students keep a copy of all papers, in case the
original is misplaced. Please do not ever slide papers under a professor's
door or pin them on the wall near their office. Remember that turning papers
in after the deadline may affect your grade and possibly leave you with a NR
(no record) in the class.  
Include a large, self-addressed stamped envelope with your paper or exam and
it will be mailed back to you. Otherwise, final papers or exams may be picked
up from the professor during his/her office hours the following quarter.
Students may also be asked to sign a waiver in class that allows instructors
to leave final papers or exams in a designated location for pick up the
following quarter. Instructors are required to retain examination papers for
one quarter following the final examination period, but it's best not to wait
until the last minute if you want your paper back. Final papers or exams are
not kept in the sociology main office with the exception of visiting
professors or faculty who may not be in residence the following quarter.

**Finals**  
The schedule for final exams is printed in the front of each _Schedule of
Classes_ booklet. The instructor may give a final examination at an alternate
time during examination week; however, students are permitted to take an
equivalent examination at the originally scheduled time, if they wish. An
instructor may not require a take home final examination to be turned in
before the date and hour at which the registrar scheduled the examination to
be given.  
An instructor may administer an examination to a student at an alternative
time if a valid reason is given for not taking the regularly scheduled
examination. Such reasons include illness, family emergency, or religious
holidays. Students need to discuss alternate arrangements with their
professor, as early as possible.

**Grades**  
Don't panic if you feel that a grading error has been made on your course work
or on your transcript. Errors can occur in adding up points or in marking
grade sheets incorrectly. The first step is to contact the professor or
teaching assistant immediately. Leave a message on their office phone, email
them, or see them during their office hours. It may also be helpful to leave a
note for their mailbox, with the administrative assistant in the front office.
**IMPORTANT: Do not throw away the course work that is in question.** If an
error has been made, the professor will complete the appropriate form to
correct the grade. Remember, this is your grade, so follow up. Check with the
registrar in approximately two weeks to make sure they received the form and
your transcript reflects the appropriate change.

**Disability Provisions**  
Professors will honor requests for special accommodations from the Office of
Students with Disabilities (OSD) for students who are registered with that
office. Students must meet with the course instructor within the first two
weeks of instruction and present a certificate from OSD recommending the
appropriate accommodations, including accommodation in test taking.  
  
**Integrity of Scholarship**  
_THE UCSD POLICY ON INTEGRITY OF SCHOLARSHIP_ , approved by the San Diego
Division of the Academic Senate, reads as follows:  
The principle of honesty must be upheld if the integrity of scholarship is to
be maintained by an academic community. The university expects that both
faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the
validity of university grading. This means that all academic work will be done
by the student to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.

**Academic Dishonesty**  

  1. No student shall knowingly procure, provide, or accept any materials that contain questions or answers to any examination or assignment to be given at a subsequent time.
  2. No student shall complete, in part or in total, any examination or assignment for another person.
  3. No student shall knowingly allow any examination or assignment to be completed, in part or in total, for himself or herself by another person.
  4. No student shall plagiarize or copy the work of another person and submit it as his or her own work.
  5. No student shall employ aids excluded by the instructor in undertaking course work.
  6. No student shall alter graded class assignments or examinations and then resubmit them for re-grading.
  7. No student shall submit substantially the same material in more than one course without prior authorization.  

**  
Responsibility**  
The instructor should state the objectives and requirements of each course at
the beginning of the term and clearly inform students in writing what kinds of
aid and collaboration, if any, are permitted on graded assignments.

Students are expected to complete the course in compliance with the
instructor's standards. No student shall engage in any activity that involves
attempting to receive a grade by means other than honest effort, as described
above, under "Academic Dishonesty."

The primary responsibility for maintaining the standards of academic honesty
rests with two university authorities: the faculty and the administration.
When a student has admitted to or has been found guilty of a violation of the
standards of academic honesty, two separate actions shall follow. The
instructor shall determine the student's grade on the assignment and in the
course as a whole. The recommended academic consequence of a serious breach of
academic honesty is failure in the course, although less serious consequences
may be incurred in less serious circumstances. The dean of the student's
college shall impose an administrative penalty. Under normal circumstances,
the recommended minimum administrative penalties are probation for the first
offense and suspension or dismissal for a subsequent offense. The transcript
of a student who is dismissed for academic dishonesty shall bear a notation
that readmission is contingent upon approval from the chancellor.

**Special Programs**  
**Honors Program (Soc/E 196A& 196B)**  
The Department of Sociology offers an honors program for those students who
have demonstrated excellence in the sociology major. Successful completion of
the Honors Program enables you to graduate  "With Highest Distinction," "With
High Distinction," or "With Distinction," depending upon your performance in
the program. This program runs fall quarter and winter quarter, each year.
Enrollment is limited, and the presiding faculty member will make the final
decision of acceptance into the program.

**Eligibility**  
Sociology majors may apply to the honors program if they meet the following
requirements:

  1. Junior or senior standing (90 units completed)

  2. 3.5 GPA or better in the major, maintained until graduation

  3. Recommendation of a faculty member familiar with your work

  4. Must have completed at least four upper- division sociology courses

  5. Overall 3.2 GPA or better, maintained until graduation

  6. Must have completed Soc/A 100 and one upper-division methods course prior to the fall quarter when the honors course begins; alternatively, the consent of the honors program director or the under- graduate director must be obtained.

Interested students may pick up an application from the staff undergraduate
coordinator in the Department of Sociology. **Completed applications must be
in the department office no later than week five of the spring quarter prior
to the start of the honors program in the fall.** If a student will be
traveling abroad during their junior year, the deadline for the application
still applies, so please make arrangements accordingly.  
  
**Course Requirements**  
The program requires students to take Soc/E 196A, _Advanced Studies in
Sociology,_ and Soc/E 196B, _Supervised Thesis Research._ These two courses
can be counted as two of the seven electives needed for the sociology major.
Students choose a faculty adviser to help supervise their thesis research and
writing. The honors program director will also assist students in this area
and fellow students in the seminar will offer excellent feedback and
suggestions. This is a wonderful program that provides participants the
opportunity to improve their skills in research and writing. Students planning
to go on to graduate school will possess a strong writing sample to submit
with their application.

If a participant's GPA in the major falls below 3.5 or their overall GPA falls
below 3.2 or if they do not earn at least an "A-" in the program, they will
not graduate with honors. However, the two courses will still count as two of
the seven electives required for the sociology major

  * Students earning an A+ will graduate "With Highest Distinction."
  * Students earning an A will graduate "With High Distinction."
  * Students earning an A- will graduate "With Distinction." 

**Academic Internships (AIP 197)**  
Students interested in sociology should consider the possibility of an
internship sometime during the course of their undergraduate years. The
benefits of an internship are considerable: career sampling, resume
enhancement, and personal growth.

Most undergraduates consider several career options before making a final--or
not so final--choice. An internship can be used as a device to test a field as
part of the process of making a rational decision about one's future. Although
internships do not, as a general rule, offer students all the responsibilities
associated with full-time jobs, they do not usually involve all of the
pressures of a full-time assignment either. What they do offer, however, is an
opportunity to get some substantive experience, while observing firsthand the
relationship between the content of a career and the lifestyle choices
associated with it.

An internship in any field improves the perceived qualifications of a job
applicant. It is seen as an indicator of serious interest; it represents an
attempt at careful career preparation. If the internship is in the field in
which an application for employment is being proffered, the applicant appears
to have reached his or her career choice on the basis of a real and positive
experience.

Finally, an internship can be great fun. It is a change from the lifestyle of
the university. It usually puts one in contact with persons of more varied age
and experience levels than those found in the context of undergraduate life.
It offers a taste of "real life." It may serve to confirm a suspected
interest. If it does not, it may be of even greater value: it can save a
student from seeking a job in an area that he or she might not enjoy.

Most internships need to be set up in advance, so be sure to plan ahead by one
or two quarters. For more information on internships, visit the Academic
Internship Office (literature building) or look into other internships offered
through the Career Services Center.

**Special Studies (Soc/E 198& Soc/E 199)**  
Special studies courses give students the rare opportunity to explore in more
detail what they have learned in the classroom. Students engage in field
research in a topic of their choice, under the guidance of a faculty member.
If a student wants to work individually with a professor, they enroll in Soc/E
199, Independent Study. If several students want to work as a team on the same
project, they take Soc/E 198, _Group Independent Study._

To enroll, a special studies application **must be submitted to the
Registrar's Office before the end of the add/drop period.** For your
convenience, there is a step-by-step instruction sheet available in the
sociology main office, along with the necessary forms. Students should meet
with a professor who has either performed research in an area they would like
to pursue, or a professor whose course they have previously taken and enjoyed.
The student and professor will decide together on a project proposal,
including the objective, the method by which it will be carried out, and the
type of finished product (paper, artifact, etc.) that will be submitted. The
instructor must provide a reading list. Once both student and faculty sponsor
have completed and signed the special studies form, it should be given to the
undergraduate coordinator, who will obtain the necessary approvals in the
department. When this is completed the form will be ready to take to the
Registrar's Office for official enrollment in either Soc/E 198 or Soc/E 199.
Plan early, allowing time for the proposal to be developed, signatures to be
obtained, etc.

Special study courses are highly recommended by the department. A special
studies course may be used to satisfy one of the seven upper-division
electives for sociology majors. Remember, special studies courses are taken
P/NP, so only one may be used towards the major.

**Study Abroad (EAP& OAP)**  
Students going abroad on the UC Education Abroad Program must fill out an
academic planning form as part of the application process. They may at that
time consult with the department about sociology courses. The EAP adviser in
the Opportunities Abroad Office will have copies of the course descriptions
for courses taught at each of the study centers, as well as approval forms.

Students going abroad through the Opportunities Abroad Program at UCSD will
need to fill out an academic planning form. This procedure is particularly
important for OAP students who expect to receive financial aid while abroad or
who expect to transfer credits back to UCSD. The academic planning form
requires students to check with the department about specific course work to
be applied toward the major. In the process of securing approval on the
academic planning form, students going abroad on OAP will be advised by the
admissions office about which courses are likely to transfer to UCSD.

Please refer to page 9 for information on petitioning courses to be used for
the sociology major which are taken abroad. The sociology department has
prepared an instruction sheet with study abroad academic planning tips for
sociology majors or minors, which is available in the main office.  
  
**Sociology Club**  
The SOCIOLOGY CLUB is a **student-led** group for sociology majors who want to
become more involved in programs and activities that focus on sociology. It
provides an opportunity: to connect with other sociology majors and minors, to
learn about career prospects, to meet your professors in an informal setting,
to discuss graduate school with graduate students, and to attend lectures by
faculty on their most recent research. Some past activities have included
films, speakers, panel discussions, and dinners. The success and survival of
the club depends solely on the participation and enthusiasm of its members.
New ideas are always welcome; please check with the undergraduate coordinator
for more information.

**Research Paper Award**  
Each year, the sociology department presents an award for the best research
paper written by an undergraduate student for a sociology course during the
year. Sociology instructors are requested to submit nominations and the
selected papers are reviewed and voted on by the Undergraduate Program
Committee. If your professor raves about one of your papers, ask them if they
would consider nominating it for the yearly Paper Prize. A gift certificate to
the UCSD bookstore for $100, along with an award certificate, is presented to
the winner at the end of the year.

**Where Do I Go for Help?**  
The undergraduate coordinator is a good place to start for any general
information concerning the undergraduate program or if you don't know who else
to contact. Questions about forms, transfer credits, petitioning, scheduling,
courses, the honors program, sociology major requirements, the minor
requirements can be answered by the undergraduate coordinator.

Problems with grades should be discussed with the instructor of the class or
TA of the section. If they feel that an error has been made, they will submit
a clerical error form to the undergraduate coordinator. If you are having a
serious conflict with an instructor, please bring your situation to the
attention of the undergraduate coordinator. _You must speak with the
undergraduate coordinator before you make an appointment with the department
chair._

Students may leave material to be placed in an instructor's or TA's mailbox
with the receptionist in the main office.

If you are a junior or senior concerned about graduate school, or if you have
some questions about our own Ph.D. program, the graduate adviser in our
department or a graduate school career adviser in the Career Services Center
is the one to contact. The director of undergraduate studies in the department
is a useful resource person, as are all of the faculty members in the
sociology department.

**Career Options**  
If you're like most students, you're probably wondering about the type of
employment sociology majors can expect after graduation. You enjoy the major
and the course of study, but will it get you a job? Rest assured, there is
life after sociology at UCSD for sociology majors. In fact, you may be
surprised to find that your broad liberal arts education gives you a wide
range of career options.

One of the virtues of a major in sociology is flexibility in the job market.
Actual entry-level job titles of UCSD sociology graduates show this diversity;
operations planner for a defense firm, program assistant for a social service
agency, teacher, programmer, production coordinator for a publishing firm,
social worker for a large, local health agency, communications technician for
a telecommunications company, sales representative, analyst, and health intake
counselor. For a more thorough list of positions held by recent graduates of
UCSD in sociology, check the Career Services Center's Web site at www-
csc.ucsd.edu to see the survey results.  
  
Now that you know that opportunities exist, how do you proceed with your own
career search? Remember three crucial pieces of advice that will enhance your
chances of finding meaningful employment after graduation. First, decide what
you want to do. A clear career goal is the essential first step of any career
search. It doesn't have to be a lifetime goal, just a plan of action for now.
The Career Services Center has many services available to help you identify an
occupation you'd like to pursue. There are workshops and information sessions
focusing on specific occupational areas, computerized career guidance
programs, printed resources on various occupations, videotapes, and helpful
advisers who can assist you in putting all the information together.

Occupations of alumni who have been in the work force for a few years will
reveal even more opportunities. Some examples are: magazine editor, contract
and grants administrator, attorney, personnel manager, probation officer,
career counselor, information specialist, and political consultant. You can
speak to these alumni about their jobs and how they applied their sociology
education to their career. Check the online Career section of the Career
Services Center's home page accessible through "quick links."

Second, get practical, work-related experience. For students who enter the job
market, studies have shown that part-time practical experience is a
significant factor of their college years that helped them to achieve success.
Graduates who had such experience consistently show a lower unemployment rate,
higher salaries, and better career potential for their jobs than those without
it. Even if you decide to go on to graduate or professional school, admissions
committees for advanced degrees favor candidates with such experience. In
addition, practical experience can help you decide what you might like to do
in the work force. By testing an occupation before committing to a full-time
career, you can see if it suits you.

There are many ways you can find pre-professional employment while going to
school. The Job Opportunities Program Office in the Career Services Center
lists on- and off-campus part-time and temporary jobs as well as paid
internships and co-op positions. Other offices on campus, specifically the
Associated Students Internship Office and Academic Internship Program in the
literature building, list internships as mentioned previously in this
handbook. If you have ideas for developing your own internship and need
assistance approaching an employer, you can discuss them with a career
adviser.

Third, as you begin your job search it is important to remember that not all
methods work equally well for all types of positions. For example, most recent
UCSD alumni surveys show that while engineering students can best spend their
job search time utilizing Career Services' job listings, attending job fairs,
and participating in on-campus interviews, sociology majors and other liberal
arts graduates should plan to utilize other strategies depending on their job
goals. Those seeking human services-related jobs would be better served using
networking and previous experience with related employers in addition to
Career Services' job listings to increase their odds of a successful outcome.
For more information on which strategies work best for your field of interest,
plan to attend Career Services' fall workshop, "How to Get a Job," or go to
the Career Center home page section on "Preparing for Your Job Search." As you
heed this advice, remember, you don't have to do it alone. The Career Services
Center is there to help, wherever you are in the search process. Even if you
reach your senior year and haven't followed the conventional wisdom described
here, it's not too late. Custom-made programs for last-minute job seekers
prepare seniors, and even graduates, for employment. </font

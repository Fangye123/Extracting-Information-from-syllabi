As announced previously, use of the Internet is a part of this course.

In this course you should develop an understanding of main themes of
historical development in the United States during the four decades when the
nation evolved from a mostly rural, agrarian society to an urbanized and
industrialized world power. You will explore those themes through extensive
and intensive reading of works by historians and, especially, of the writings
of American leaders from the times who grappled with the problems of "big
business," political corruption, immigration, ethnic diversity and racism,
"the labor question," and imperialism. You will also use the World Wide Web to
access materials made available especially for this course, and engage in
exercises associated with web-based materials. You will display the results of
you explorations through carefully written and presented papers, in quizzes
conducted in class, and through an essay final examination. The essay final
examination will include questions directly drawn from the reading
assignments.

REQUIRED READINGS

Available at SBX:

Melvyn Dubofsky, _Industrialism and the American Worker, 1865-1920_ (3 rd ed.)

Alan M. Kraut, _The Huddled Masses: The Immigrant in American Society,
1880-1921

_

Harold C. Livesay, _Andrew Carnegie and the Rise of Big Business

_

Other reading assignments are available for you on the World Wide Web, and are
listed in the Course Calendar below. Please have these assignments completed
before the class meeting.

PREPARED CLASS ATTENDANCE IS REQUIRED.

Class attendance is the norm; absence is excused in the case of emergency
(please stay home and get well if you are ill!). Too many unexcused absences
normally result in a lowered course grade. The norm is to have read the
assignment prior to class.

PAPERS

  1. You will write a biographical paper on a historical figure from the time period using standard reference sources. This paper is to be 5 pp. double-spaced (no more than 1,500 words). The due date will vary according to the subject chosen. For this paper you will use standard reference sources, which will include visits by you to the University Library; for a compilation of standard sources you will consult the "Biographies" section of the 2nd edition of the _Harvard Guide to American History._ Starting on page six of your paper you will discuss your sources. For this discussion you should consult, at a minimum, the _Dictionary of American Biography, Notable American Women_ , the _Encyclopedia of American Business History and Biography, Who Was Who,_ and the _New York Times Obituary Index_ (and the obituary in the _Times_ to which it referred). The subjects of the paper are the authors of the readings you are completing for the class discussions. Your paper will be about one of the following individuals: Jane Addams, Newton D. Baker, J. Ellen Foster, Henry George, Washington Gladden, Robert Hunter, Frances Kellor, Henry Demarest Lloyd, Walter Rauschenbusch, Lincoln Steffens, Frederick W. Taylor, of Frances Willard. The paper will answer these questions:

  * Who was this person? 
  * When and where did he or she live? 
  * What were his or her main contributions to society? 
  * What was the historical significance of this person? 
  * What were his or her principal experiences in life that shaped his or her ideology? 
  * With what other significant individuals, groups, or institutions did the person associate? 
  * What gave rise to the particular writing on hand? 
  * What was the significance of this particular writing in American history? How does better understanding this person, and this writing, contribute to an understanding of the period under study, 1877-1917?

  1. The second paper is about "the labor problem" as Americans saw it during the Gilded Age and Progressive Era. The paper will focus on the Anthracite Coal Strike of 1902. It will be grounded in the assigned readings for the course, especially the books by Livesay and Dubofsky. Some of the sources for this paper are available on the World Wide Web. You will also use the library (the University Library has materials, and you may choose to use the Ohio Historical Society library.). The paper will be about 5 pp. long (1,500 words). On an additional page you will discuss the individual sources you used in the library. The paper will address these questions:

  * What was the context of the anthracite coal strike of 1902? Characterize the "labor problem" of the time, based on your reading, and lectures and class discussions. What was the context of this strike in the history of the industry? 
  * What were the business institutions of the anthracite coal industry like? What was the ownership structure like, and what was the market for anthracite coal? 
  * What were the working conditions like for coal miners? Who were the coal miners? 
  * How did the government respond to this strike? How was the federal government's response similar or different from earlier strikes in the Gilded Age? 
  * What was the public reaction to this strike, as seen in newspapers and in cartoon commentary? 
  * In addition to the evidence of public reaction made available to the entire class, what have you learned about public reaction to the strike from examining at least one newspaper of your choice? 
  * From the sources you have explored, what is your assessment of "the labor problem" as a historical phenomenon?

PAPER RULES

_

In papers for this course, there are some rules to follow.

  1. The rules of plagiarism apply. You should cite materials, and ideas not your own, in either endnotes or footnotes. If you are in doubt, you should ask.
  2. You will turn in your paper in a folder. The folder will include copies of the notes you have made in preparing your paper, and/or the Xerox or other copies you have made.
  3. Your use of English is important in the papers and in almost any serious work you do. Be careful to use the language properly. Spell words correctly, use complete sentences, and make sure that each paragraph includes a topic sentence (experienced writers often make the first sentence in a paragraph the topic sentence). Provide your readers with a structure for the paper--an introduction, main body, and conclusion. Improper English may result in a lowered grade for the paper. You may correct last minute mistakes with a pencil.

Make sure the numbered pages are all securely fastened together. Have your
name and Social Security number on the first page, and your name on each
subsequent page. You must keep a copy of the paper until you receive your
course grade. You do need to present your paper printed with a fresh ribbon in
at least Near Letter Quality. Double-space your paper.

TESTS

In addition to the final examination, there are quizzes in class. One quiz
covers _Andrew Carnegie_ , and there are brief quizzes on primary source
readings. (Make-up quizzes are allowed only for excused absences--illness or
official university function--and are "take-home" exercises.) The quizzes
cover the following subjects:

    3. Henry Demarest Lloyd (2 points)

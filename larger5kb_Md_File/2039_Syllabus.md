**Race and Ethnic Relations**

**Dr. Robert McNamara  
294-3300 or 467-1787**

PURPOSE: This course is designed to expose students to the historical and
social background of race and ethnicity in American society and to focus on
specific topics related to these issues.

READING: Aguirre, Adalberto and David Baker. Sources: Notable Selections  
in Race and Ethnicity.

Feagin, Joe R. and Hernan Vera. White Racism.

Zweigenhaft, Richard L. and G. William Domhoff. Blacks in the  
White Establishment.

Weiss, Robert S. Learning From Strangers: The Art and Method of  
Qualitatitve Interview Studies. (OPTIONAL)

Note: Other handouts to be given in class.

REQUIREMENTS: There will be three exams during the course of the term, which
includes a comprehensive final exam. Each exam will be weighted so that you
are rewarded for your best score. Additionally, you will be required to lead a
discussion on one of the articles in the Aguirre reader. I will have more to
say on this in class, but it is important to develop your presentation skills
and the only way to do this is to practice. Finally, there will be a field
project as part of the requirements for the course. Like the presentations, I
will be going into more detail on this in class, but recognize there are
numerous research possibilities that will emerge from this project.

Grading:  
3 Exams (15%, 20%, 25%)  
Project 35%  
Presentation 5%

  
Attendance Policy: Given the university's concern about student attendance, it
is important to understand my attendance policy. I hope this does not become
problematic, but I must tell you that excessive unexcused absences, which I
define according to the university policy (see page 53 of the catalog) will
result in a failing grade for the course. This policy is very clear and
states: "A student who has earned fewer than 30 hours will be automatically
dropped form a course if absent (for any reason) 15 percent of the class
meetings. A student who has earned credit on a minimum of 30 hours will be
dropped from a course if absent 25 percent of the class meetings. In both
cases, a grade of F will be recorded unless the absences were due to
providential reasons, in which cases a grade of W will be assigned."  
Additionally, if you miss three classes in a row, I am required to notify the
Dean. If you have questions regarding the university policy, I suggest you
peruse Furman's catalog, specifically, page 53.

Also, if you are late to class it is YOUR responsibility to make sure I have
noted this on my attendance roster. Failure to do so results in an absence: it
is not my responsibility to make certain you are in class. THERE WILL BE NO
EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE. The easiest way to avoid this is to meet your
obligations and get to class on time. PLEASE DO NOT MAKE THIS AN ISSUE!  
Office Hours: While I will be in my office from 11am -12 noon each day, I
would be happy to make an appointment with you if this conflicts with your
schedule.

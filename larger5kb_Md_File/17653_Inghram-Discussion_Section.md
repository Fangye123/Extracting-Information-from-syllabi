> _**General Information**_

>

> _Readings_ :

>

> Readings are available at Shipmates in Stuyvesant Plaza (and should be
labeled  
>  as UNI 152, with my name on the packet.) Their phone number is: 458-7758.

>

> _Discussion Section Outline_ :

>

> This outline includes the reading schedule for UNI 152M only. Refer to the
[UNI 151L reading outline](read.html) for the core lecture reading schedule.
Note also that, for your convenience, a Monday through Friday schedule is
outlined below, although [Prof. Scatton ](../prfac/ernie.html) will provide
his own discussion format for the Thursday meetings. Refer any questions
regarding the form and/or content of the Thursday class meetings to him.

>

> _Friday Conferences_ :

>

> With the exception of September 27 (when all students will meet for
"netscape surfing"), the Friday class hour is devoted to individual
conferences on a rotating schedule. As the need arises throughout the
semester, we will use these Friday class times to discuss your progress within
the course. Therefore, although we might not use these class times each week,
you should not schedule other activities during these times. See schedule of
appointments (yellow-coloured handout)

>

> _Attendance Policy_ :

>

> Attendance is required for all class meetings, and will be reflected in the
"participation" portion of your final joint grade for UNI 152M/UNI 151L (30%).
(Note that "participation" also includes regular contributions to the
discussions and activities of each class meeting.) Arriving to class on time
is important, especially on those occasions where we are meeting in another
location (library computer room, media instruction classroom, etc.). If you
are late, you will not know where the rest of us are! _If you are registered
for the first discussion section (1:25-2:20), you may **not** come to the
second section (2:30-3:25) if you miss the first section. The same policy
applies for those enrolled in the second section (i.e., vice-versa). Special
circumstances should be discussed with the instructor in advance.

>

> Refer to Scatton/Inghram course handout for specific information  
>  on details of assignments. See also schedule below.

>

> _Tentative Reading Schedule_ ****  
> ( _all readings below are for Wednesday discussions, unless otherwise noted_
)

>

> _General Note_ :

>

> The theme for most of the discussion sections will center around [historic
social constructions of reality](calvin1.html), as they are related to the
various issues of identity and technology presented in the core
lectures/readings. Look around you. Most everything you can see, hear, feel,
touch, etc., was socially constructed (and/or is undergoing construction).
Material realities, such as the physical structure of our homes, businesses,
and our University, are (literally!) concrete constructions which are readily
identifiable. However, ideological realities, such as norms, values, and
beliefs, are not as readily perceived; instead they are more abstract social
constructs. For example, scientists tell us there is no biological conception
of race. Therefore, we must ask where and why social constructions of race
developed. With regard to socialization, we must ask how the individual forms
his or her identity. To what extent is this identity socially constructed by
the prevailing norms and values of a particular culture? Are gender roles
likewise socially constructed? If so, by whom and why? What about racism and
sexism? If these abstract realities were socially constructed, is it possible
to deconstruct them? The nature of these social constructions of reality is
examined throughout this discussion section, paying close attention to how
historic notions (choose any time period you want!) differ from contemporary
constructions. We will view cartoons, movies, slides, art, music, postage
stamps, etc., as well as discuss the following readings:

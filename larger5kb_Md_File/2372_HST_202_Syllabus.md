Introduction

This course will examine American history from pre-Columbian times to the end
of Reconstruction. A focal point for our study will be the construction and
development of American identity in the context of a nation comprised of a
great diversity of peoples. Several important themes in our examination of
this period will be cultural interactions, the development of the ideology of
republicanism, slavery, reform movements, and the defintion of the American
state.

While the primary mode of teaching in this class will be lecture, the active
participation of students in this intellectual endeavor is essential. That is,
you should not just sit back and absorb the material as presented, but should
instead engage it critically, asking questions of the material, challenging
the views presented, and developing your own interpretation of the history of
this period. My job as the instructor is to facilitate this through my
presentation of materials and questions, but as students you must also be
active participants in this class. Discussion sections will not be the only
place for discussion. It is also essential that students do the readings as
they are assigned.

History is not simply a narrative of facts, dates, and names. Instead, it is
an interpretation, and thus is constantly in flux. Analysis is the central
tool of the historian, not memorization. Thus, while you will need to know
important names and dates, of greater importance is an understanding of themes
and the ability to challenge the material and create an interpretation.
Wherever possible, I will discuss the variety of viewpoints among historians.

**Course Objective**  

  
Operations Management is concerned with planning, organizing and controlling
the value-adding transformation process to meet the goals of an organization.
The organization may be a goods producer, a service provider, or a combination
of both. The organization may operate in the private sector or in the public
sector.  
The specific objective of the course include:  
1\. To gain an exposure to the spectrum of operations planning and decision-
making activities, with a focus on service operations.  
2\. To acquire knowledge of the tools and strategies a manager can apply to
facilitate effective operations.  
3\. To develop a capacity for analyzing operational problems on a functional,
business, and company-wide basis.  

**Textbook and Course Readings**

  
[Text] _Service Management --- Operations, Strategy, and Information
Technology_ ,  
(2nd Edition) by Fitzsimmons/Fitzsimmons, Irwin/McGraw-Hill.  
Two course packages are available for purchase in Room 117, University Center
that include:  
[Note] Lecture Notes (printout of PowerPoint transparencies)  
[Case] Cases from Harvard Business School  
[Supp] Supplementary materials from other sources  

**Performance Evaluation**  

  
**_Grade Distribution_**  
  
In-Class Midterm 25%  
In-Class Final Exam 35%  
Two Written Case Reports 30%  
Class Participation and Contribution 10%  
  
At the end of the semester, I will calculate the weighted total grades for all
students in this class and rank them in descending order. I will then look for
appropriate gaps in the ranked list to assign grade breaks (i.e., from "A" to
"B" to "C", etc.).  
  
**_Case Method_**  
  
The case method is used in the course. Study questions on each assigned case
are listed immediately following a brief description of the case in the
Detailed Course Outline. These questions should serve as a starting point of
your analysis. You should decide what are the key issues and how they can best
be addressed. All class members are expected to have read the case and
reflected upon the assigned questions. In addition, class members are
encouraged to incorporate concepts from the assigned readings into their
analysis of the case.  
  
There are a total of five cases. You are required to written reports for two
of them. The details are as follows:  
  
(1) One of the written case report should be based on either "Manzana
Insurance" or on "University Health Service: Walk-In Clinic". This report is
worth 20% of the total grade.  
  
(2) The second written report should be based on one of the remaining three
cases: "Club Med (A)", "A Measure of Delight: AT&T Universal Card Service", or
"Proctor & Gamble: Process Redesign". The second report is worth 10% of the
total grade.  
  
(3) You may choose to submit each of the two case reports individually or in a
group of no more than three students.  
  
(4) The page limit for each report is five pages of double spaced text, plus
exhibits. Note that these are maximum limits. Paper should be concise and
coherent. Exhibits should contain specific types of analyses (application of a
framework, table of comparisons, cost analysis, figures, etc.) and information
that would be too detailed for the body of the paper.  
  
(5) All written reports must be prepared in advance of the date on which the
case will be discussed (see Detailed Course Outline), and must be submitted at
the start of that session. Please make a copy for your own use during class.  
  
**_Class Participation and Contribution_**  
  
Active participation is expected throughout the entire class with thoughtful
contributions to advance the quality of the discussion. Please be aware that
the number of times that you speak in class is only one of the criteria for
effective class participation; other criteria, some of which are in fact more
important, are whether you are a good listener in class, whether your points
are relevant to the discussion and show evidence of analysis, whether you are
willing to test new ideas (as opposed to always staying on the "safe" grounds
such as stating case facts), and generally, whether you are putting sufficient
time and energy into the course.  
  
**_Suggested Exercises_**  
  
For some of the topics that involve quantitative analysis, I will suggest a
number of exercise problems. Although these suggested exercises are not to be
handed in for grading (the solutions will be reserved in the university center
library), you are _strongly_ encouraged to work on all of them first on your
own before resorting to the solution I provide. It should prove to be a very
effective learning process and an especially helpful way to prepare for the
exams.

[Case] "Manzana Insurance"  
  
_Case Study_ : **Manzana Insurance**  
  
The Fruitvale Branch of Manzana Insurance is struggling to compete in
California's rocky insurance industry. Fruitvale's manager, John Lombard, must
decide how to respond to a local competitor's promise of a one-day turnaround
time for new policy requests, or face the likelihood of losing additional
agents and subsequent business. The case deals with performance assessment and
improvement of a service operation process in the insurance industry, a market
that is highly sensitive to response time.  
  
_Study Questions_ :  
  
(1) What are the problems that the Friutvale Branch is facing? What are the
causes of these problems?  
  
(2) Analyze current processes used to handle various types of service
requests. What is your assessment of the rules used to assign priorities in
Fruitval operations? Can you identify the problems in the way Manzana is
calculating turnaround time in Exhibit 3 of the case?

The walk-in clinic for general outpatient care at a major university
experiences complaints about excessive waiting times. The system is changed to
provide for initial screening of arriving patients in order to route them to
appropriate health care providers. The administrator of the clinic must
appraise the new system and decide what further changes to make. Analysis of
the case may involve both quantitative analysis and consideration of
managerial issues. However, you do not need (and do not have) to use the
mathematical queue models introduced in the last class in order to understand
underlying issues addressed by this case.  
  
_Study Questions_ :  
  
(1) Compare the old (pre-triage) and new (triage) systems. Evaluate the
performance of the Walk-In Clinic. Are waiting-times now acceptable?  
  
(2) Why are "walk-in appointments" a problem? What should Ms. Angell do about
them, if anything?

_Case Study_ : **A Measure of Delight: AT &T Universal Card Service**  
  
AT&T's Universal Card Services (UCS) has been extremely successful during its
short lifetime. Dedicated to improving service quality and customer
satisfaction, Chief Quality Officer Rob Davis and his Quality Team have
designed and put into place an unusual measurement and compensation system
based on more than 100 performance measures monitored and communicated daily.
Despite the company's success, its management continues to struggle to balance
the tensions that arise from linking compensation to performance measures.  
  
_Study Questions_ :  
  
(1) How would you assess the strengths and weaknesses of UCS's overall quality
system?  
  
(2) How would you describe UCS's measurement subsystem? Why does UCS spend so
much energy on measuring internal process performance?  
  
(3) How would you describe UCS's compensation subsystem? Does it support
continuous improvement or does it simply support a sustainable level of
service?

Procter & Gamble Worldwide (P&G) is one of the largest manufacturers supplying
grocery retailers and wholesalers. The case describes the company's
innovations in redesigning the distribution channels for its product. Changes
at P&G in organization, systems, procedures, and policies affected both the
company and the entire channel. These changes were governed by the recognition
that manufacturers, distributors, and retailers have to cooperate in creating
industry-wide approaches to drive inefficiency out of the distribution system.  
  
_Study Questions_ :  
  
(1) Compare the old distribution system and the newly designed system, what
were the major changes? What were the key decisions taken by Proctor & Gamble

_**READINGS ON THE HOLOCAUST: SYLLABUS**_

_**COURSE DESCRIPTION**_

In this course we will read and discuss important works about the Holocaust in
order to examine some of the psychological, moral and historiographical issues
it raises. We will also learn and practice some of the skills used in creating
history: interpreting primary sources, assessing secondary works, and
reporting orally and in writing about our findings.

This is an intensive reading course: We will read one book per week. Each week
two students will present their research to the class, while all other
students will write short (2 page) essays or prepare questions. Each student
will write a research paper on one of the weekly topics.

_**REQUIREMENTS**_

  1. This course is designed for students concurrently enrolled in Hist 133D, or who have a substantial prior knowledge of Holocaust or German history. Thus all participants must have taken a course in the UCSB Hist 133 series, or the equivalent at another school. In the latter case, permission of the instructor is required. 
  2. Regular, active **participation** in class discussion, which counts for 40% (!) of the final grade. 
  3. Submission of **four short papers** , about 500 words (2 double-spaced, typed pages) in length, on the weekly questions about the readings (see reverse side). Please note that I will be looking more for a coherent and thoughtful engagement with the material than a comprehensive paper that addresses all aspects of the question(s). You should be sure to _argue a thesis_ using _specific examples_ as evidence to back up your argument. These papers are due on **Tuesdays, by 2pm** , in the envelope outside my office. Each is worth 5% of your final grade (A=5, B=4,  ) for a total of 20%. 
  4. Submission of **four sets of 5-10 questions** each, about the weekly readings. Some of each set may address specific points that you don't understand; others should aim at broader issues raised by the material. These are also due on **Tuesdays, by 2pm** , in the envelope outside my office. Each question set is worth 4% of the final grade (16% altogether). 
  5. **Research presentation** (10-15mins.) (this will usually be done by teams of two or more students). An outline of the presentation is due in the instructor's office on **Monday by 4pm**. Each week's team should meet with the professor beforehand to review their discussion plan. (5% of final grade) 
  6. A **short paper** (5-7 pages, plus bibliography) discussing your research topic in a more formal way. This will normally be due one week after the class discussion. (20% of final grade) 
  7. There will be no midterm or final examination.

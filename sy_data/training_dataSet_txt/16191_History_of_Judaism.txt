    History of Judaism     History of Judaism (RelSt 120/History 100)  Spring, 1998     Instructor Gary G. Porton			3004 Foreign Languages Building			333-0473			g-porton@uiuc.eud			TuTh 10-11 or by appointment     I. Course Summary This course will survey the history of Judaism from the period			of the Hebrew Bible through the contemporary world. The course			will focus on the ideas central to Judaism as a religious-cultural-social			phenomenon instead of the political or economic history of Jews			in various parts of the world or at different periods of time.			However, the ideas and concepts we shall study and analyze will			be set in their historical contexts, so that we may gage the interaction			of Jews and Judaism with their larger environments and the interdependence			and mutual influences of the Jews and those around them. In this course, we assume that Judaism is a human creation, so			that it may be studied, analyzed, and interpreted according to			the canons of normal scholarly disciplines. Furthermore, we presupposed			that religion, a term we shall discuss throughout the semester,			is a central element in the complex of ideas, symbols, and actions			known as Judaism, so that the "religious" element within Judaism			will be our major concern. We further presupposed that Judaism has changed and developed			through time and that it is our task to follow these changes,			to understand them, and to attempt to explain them. In addition,			we shall hold that no one form of Judaism is better than or more			authentic than any other form. Our goal is to understand, analyze			and interpret the various complexes which are known as Judaism			and not to evaluate their legitimacy with regard to one another			or to determine which, if any, is True.      II. Course Requirements  Each student is expected to complete the reading assignments for				each topic before it is discussed in class. 				Each student is expected to attend each class session and to participate				in class discussions. 				Each student is expected to purchase his/her own copy of Robert				M. Seltzer, Jewish People, Jewish Thought: The Jewish Experience				in History, Judith Baskin, Jewish Women in Historical Perspective,				and the course reader from UpClose 714 6th street. The reader				comes in 2 volumes. 				There will be three major writing assignments, 8-10 pages each,				which will take the place of the midterms and finals. Students				will be expected to complete these assignments on time and according				to the requirements stated with the assignments. 				Each Thursday, each student will hand in a summary of no more				than 250 words of the chapters from Baskin which were assigned				for that week. Be sure to review the sheet of writing tips before				you write each paper. This will make our job much easier and prevent				a good deal of frustration on your part. Failure to hand in papers				on time will result in the loss of 1/2 grade for each day the				paper is late. 				Every Thursday each student will hand in two diary entries, one				for each day of class during the previous week. The entry should				be comments on the readings, lectures, discussions, or any other				information, issues, or comments relevant to the study of Judaism.				At least the students should record their reactions to what they				have read in Seltzer and heard and discussed in the lectures.				The students should also comment on what they thought was important,				whether or not they thought the reading was interesting and why,				whether or not they thought the classroom lecture and discussion				were interesting and why. They should also comment on any thing				they have read, heard, or done outside of class that is relevant				to the study of Judaism. Each entry will be worth 2 points. While				I will read each entry, I will not comment on them or correct				them, so feel free to express yourself. They may be handwritten.								Each student will write a book-review of any scholarly book on				the history of Judaism, Jews, Jewish Culture, Society, or Literature.				The book must be approved by the instructor by March 12, 1998.				The instructions concerning the book review will be handed out				in class. The book-review is due on Thursday April 21, 1998. 				Each take home examination will be worth 25% of your final grade.				The diary will be worth 10% of your final grade. The book review				will be worth 10% of your final grade. The outlines of Baskin's				book will be worth 5% of your final grade. For borderline grades,				class participation and attendance will be the deciding factor.							 Failure to hand in all of the essays, the book review, the summaries			of the chapters in Baskin, and a complete diary will result in			a failing grade. You must do all of the written assignments to			receive credit for the course. NB: In addition to the two text-books, you will be purchasing			a collection of documents from UpClose. Seltzer spends a good			deal of time citing documents and discussing them, and the reader			contains many of the texts upon which Seltzer bases his discussions.			These will also be extremely helpful when you write your papers.			They are to serve as a supplement to Seltzer; however, we may			discuss any of them in class. Please read the material; it will			make Seltzer much easier to understand. Bring the readers to class			each session. NB: Unfortunately, Macmillan is publishing a second edition of			Seltzer's book January, 1998, and it is not yet available. The			pages below are from the first edition. I have no idea how the			two editions will differ; if the pages have changed, I will hand			out a new syllabus when I see the book.     III. Reading Assignments A.

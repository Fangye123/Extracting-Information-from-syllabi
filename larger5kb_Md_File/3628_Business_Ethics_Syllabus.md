**Course Description:**  
This is a course in 'applied ethics'.  This means that we will be considering
ethical issues which arise in a specific area of human activity--in this case
_business_.   We will attempt to better understand theses issues and resolve
related moral questions by applying the ethical insights of one or more common
normative ethical theories.  The course will begin by introducing the student
to several common approached to normative ethics.

**Texts:**

**Requirements and Related Issues:**

Unlike mathematics, English composition or American History, we do not recieve
a strong grounding in philosophy at the pre-collegiate level of our education.
Therefore I cannot over-emphasize the need for regular attendance, preparation
and participation. Here is my attendance policy (modeled after my last private
sector job): you may miss two (2) class meetings without penalty. Each
additional class you miss will lower your final grade by one half letter
grade. You may use your 'cuts' as you see fit, but they do not license late
work or missed assignments. You earn one 'cut' on the first day and one more
'cut' when you turn in your mid-term exam. People who miss fewer than two
class periods will recieve favorable treatment in borderline grade situations.
The actual requirements are:  
    
  | In-Class Presentation(s) | 30%  
---|---  
Quiz | 10%  
Take-Home Mid-Term Exam | 30%  
Take-Home Final Exam  | 30%  
  


**Presentations:** Each student will be asked to make one or more in-class
presentations as part of a pro-con "debate" format discussion. Each student
will prepare an 8-10 minute "advocate" presentation on an assigned topic and a
2 minute "rebuttal" presentation. Presentation outlines/texts need to be
exchanged at least one class period priori to the date of the actual
presentations. The format will be Pro Advocate, Con Advocate, Pro Rebuttal,
Con Rebuttal. At the end of the formal presentations the presenters will take
questions from the class. [note1- if you plan on going into business you need
to be a skilled oral presenter, note2- effective oral communication skills are
useful in all fields] Presentations will address case studies and/or selected
readings. Presentations will be graded upon preparation, clarity, accuracy, as
well as upon the quality of the presentation style itself.  

**Exams:** Take-home exams will ask the student to write on 3-5 specified
topics. You will write 1-5 pp. on each question as appropriate. These exams
will be "open book" but should be prepared alone. However you are encouraged
to discuss the questions/issues with your classmates. These are due in class
at the START of the designated period (or before). Late exams turned in during
class will take an automatic 10% grade penalty, late exams turned in after the
class period end take an additional 10% penalty. Late exams not turned in
prior to the start of the next class period automatically fail. You will get
the exam questions at least two-weeks in advance of the due date.

**The Small Print:**  
The assignments and requirments described herein are subject to revision at
any time at the instructor's discretion. It is in all cases and situations the
sole responsibility of the student to remain well informed regarding any
changes or alterations. Attendance by the student of one or more class periods
shall constitute both explicit and implict recognition of, and submission to
the conditions set forth in this document. Any and all other class related
issues not explicitly governed by this syllabus are subject to the mindless
whim of the instructor. If the instructor believes there is reason to suspect
a student of academic dishonesty, the instructor reserves the right to
substitute a gruelling and embarassing public oral examination for any suspect
assignment.

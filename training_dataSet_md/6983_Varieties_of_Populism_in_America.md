This syllabus was provided by Robert Johnston of Yale University. He invites
comments, additional citations, questions, etc. Many thanks to him for sending
it. Underlining of book and journal titles disappeared when I converted his
text file to ASCII, but I don't think you'll have any problem identifying
where they should go.

**JUNIOR SEMINAR: VARIETIES OF POPULISM IN AMERICA, 1892-1992**

With our political culture in crisis, citizens and intellectuals have turned
intently to a reexamination of our nation's political traditions. This work
encompasses social theory, philosophy, and even theology. Yet it shares a
common hope that we can uncover and recover that which is best in our
heritage.

Populism--roughly defined as the call for the empowerment of ordinary people
in all areas of life--is, arguably, one of those noble traditions that
Americans should draw on to reinvigorate our public sphere. At the very least,
populism has been one of the most powerful social and ideological currents
shaping our past and current prospects. It is a tradition, or set of
traditions, that demands reckoning.

That is the fundamental purpose of the course. Toward that end, we will meet
in a seminar format where the main responsibility for intellectual inquiry,
and hence discussion, will rest with the students.

The other major purpose of the course is to learn and practice, in a
collective environment, some of the basic skills of historical research and
writing. The end product will be a substantial primary-source based paper on a
topic of your choice on the general theme of populism. You should leave the
seminar with significant preparation for your senior essay.

Evaluation will be based equally on your written work over the semester, your
final research paper, and your class participation.

  1. 15-25 page research paper, due Sunday, December 18th.

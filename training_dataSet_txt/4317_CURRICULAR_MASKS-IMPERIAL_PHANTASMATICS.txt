CONCESSIONARY NARRATIVES
         In 1993 I published an essay  entitled "Decolonizing the
English Past:  Readings in Medieval Archaeology and History" in the
North-American-based  Journal of British Studies.   The paper questioned
the category "medieval English peasant,"  which had informed my work in
economic history for the first decade of my academic research.  I argued for
the category's construction in India in the later nineteenth century through a
two-fold process of  adjudicating colonial property rights in India  and
emplotting  constitutional histories as national allegories in England.
"Medieval English peasant"   worked as the ideological  product of "English
India," a term used by Sara Suleri to express the literal and figurative
intimacies of such dichotomous pairings as  national-colonial,
colonizer-colonized, colonial,-postcolonial. [1]   My  essay then tried to imagine how to
undo this category.  I wished to set its political historiography back in
motion in order to write other economic histories.    An American editor of a
prospective volume on medieval peasant studies, targeted for an English
publisher,   invited this  essay for  reprint.  I welcomed  the opportunity of
its  traveling  more widely.  It turned out, however, that a reader for the
press, a prominent English  medieval historian, would not sign off, unless my
essay was pulled from the collection.   An editorial dilemma--with profuse
apologies to me, the editor dropped the piece  and the book  went forward to
press. 
    This minor skirmish  in  academic publishing  productively  shifted my
critical attention from  the historicist complications  posed by  English India
to what I will come to call in this paper the  performance of "English America"
and the politics of its border patrol. [2]  I
use "English America" as a kind of shorthand for the complex ways in which
North American medieval studies, since its so-called "take-off" with the GI
Bill  after World War II, mimes British imperial  phantasmatics and thereby
does the  work of reproducing an  "Englishness"  that  can then be exported
back to England in a vertiginous transnational exchange of imageric power. [3]   North American medievalists may protest at
this juncture, countering  that surely the publication of my essay in the
Journal of British Studies countermands such a claim about circulation.
I suggest  in turn that  its publication was an instance of North American
medieval  studies  mistaking a concessionary narrative.  Peter Hulme has
defined  a concessionary narrative as one  that  "goes some way toward
recognizing a native point of view and offering a critique of European
behaviour, but [it] can only do this by not addressing the central issue"
(Hulme: 253).  [4]      My essay could not be
exported back to England because it explicitly violated  such a narrative
agreement  by  exposing  the production of a category of English India "English
medieval peasant" and its historiographic force. [5] 
    This publishing lesson taught me how  transnational publishing performs
"English America"  in specific ways.   The fate of one essay in the circulation
of that phantasmatic does not much matter.  What concerns me more about this
performance is its repetition in the History Department curriculum.  One of my
job responsibilities is defined as teaching the "undergraduate medieval English
survey."  The "medieval English survey"  still persists as a common course
offering, often  required  of undergraduate history majors  in North
American universities.  But what is the performative nature of this survey,
and what does it have to do with ensuring British imperial  phantasmatics?  In
other words, what does it mean to read the survey through the phantasmatics of
English America?    I will take my cue for such a reading from Gauri
Viswanathan, who has written eloquently on the construction of English Studies
through the India Service.  About curricular process she writes:  "Until
curriculum is studied less as a receptacle of texts than as activity, that it
to say, as a vehicle of acquiring and exercising power, descriptions of
curricular content in terms of their expression of universal values on the one
hand, or pluralistic, secular identities on the other are insufficient
signifiers of their historical reality"(167). [6] 
    My paper   troubles the  three terms of the survey:   the timing  of
"medieval",  the repetition  of "English[ness], " and the gaze of a national
"survey,"  which keeps imperialism in a space-off.   I get to this trouble
through an analysis of the major historiographical investments of the British
journal  Past and Present, founded  in Birmingham by British Marxists in
1952.   I wish to join the North American performance of the medieval English
survey   with the  historiographical phantasmatics conjured by Past and
Present in the wake of the loss of the Raj and in the  constitution of
postcolonial racial politics in Britain from the 1960s to the Thatcher years.
During that time, the journal  advocated the history of the family  and of
crime  as a major focus of historical study.  In what ways, I ask, does the
history of the family and crime offer a pastoral space, a shadow in which the
historian stands seemingly protected from neo-imperial racial politics? The
medieval English survey lies, I hope to show you, in the pastoral shade of this
racism:   the survey does the melancholic work of holding the impossibility of
Englishness at bay.  
       Twisted paths led to my  study of this  pastoral politics.  I will offer
a  map to them now and invite you to spend some time in the course of this
essay at some of  the  most contested sites.   First, I plunge my readers into
my pedagogical formation as a teacher of the "medieval English survey"  at the
University of Notre Dame in Indiana , my first and current teaching position.
I endeavor to show how that teaching experience led to a specific meditation on
the ideology of a  "pastoral" survey.  I then turn my attention to a
far-reaching pastoral crisis as exemplified in the thematics of the journal
Past and Present.    I trace how the pastoral politics of Robin Hood in
the 1950s, an obsessive topic in the early years of publication of Past and
Present,  bleeds into a pastoral historiography of the family in the 1960s
and a pastoral historiography of crime in the 1980s.  I contrast this pastoral
politics of Past and Present with a counter-politics of the Birmingham
School of Contemporary Cultural Studies founded in 1964.    The separateness
of these two adjoining institutional projects becomes exemplary for me in
understanding the pastoral space that can deny  the gap in  term "English
America." (Viswanathan 1991)


IN THE SHADOW OF THE FOOTBALL STADIUM:  AROUND 1987
 
    The autumn semester 1987 at the Universtity of Notre Dame:  I am teaching
the medieval English survey.  On  October 16, 1987, fierce winds of hurricane
force devastate over 500,000 trees in the south of England.  The British papers
talk of "felled giants,"  how the ancient seven oaks of Sevenoaks, Kent,  lay
uprooted and dying in the aftermath.  That same autumn, the British film maker
Derek Jarman worked on  his film entitled The Last of England,  which he
described as a "dream allegory (in which) the present dreams the past future"
(Jarman 1987,188).    In  the opening voice-over of the film, Jarman alludes to
the dead trees and lost ancient woodland: "The oaks died this year.  On every
green hill mourners stand, and weep for The Last of England" (Jarman
1987, 188)

    Also in 1987:   Margaret Thatcher, too,  announced the last of England.
She said:    "There is no such thing as society.  There are individual men and
women and there are families".(Strathern, 158).   Thatcher dreams the collapse
of polity   into the nuclear  family as site of consumption.  Only the purchase
of commodities can continue to make agency visible in this dream world.  Her
speech could be easily mistaken as an advertisement for Benneton. Englishness
works no  longer as an imperial-national culture, a teleological  necessity,
but rather, now, in the late 1980s,  as a transnational "style"--you too can
choose it, buy it, wear it, eat it,  implant it, grow it in a test-tube, in the
shadow of the family tree, naturally.   


DREAMS 1987 
     I dreamt a painful dream that autumn.  In the dream I saw some kind of
intricate, vivid, shiny metallic pattern,  like some shard or crumbled piece of
a mask.   At first it seemed  menacingly   indecipherable  when, suddenly, it
struck me with all the relief  of dream-recognition that it was Celtic
interlace.  That seemed to explain everything!   From many years of dream-work
I could sense that a crucial piece of a haunting puzzle had fallen into place.

    I know that my aging great-grandmother had come to die at the house of  her
daughter, Sarah Gallagher, who had left Donegal, Ireland in her teens.  The
large, hairy,  aged woman sitting in the corner of my grandmother's kitchen
spoke in a language that made no sense to me, and mine seemed to make no sense
to her;  our  nonsense  profoundly  frightened me.   A solipsistic
four-year-old, I had not yet learned that there was more than one language in
the world.    Not long  after  my great-grandmother died.  We drove  a
seemingly interminable distance  to Brooklyn for the wake.  As I climbed the
heights to her bier, the  nonsense got all mixed up with her deathly silence.
Only  much later did I learn that my great-grandmother spoke in Gaelic to me,
or so the story was told.   My  dream  had dreamed  Britain thinking me as a
child through the broken  migrant histories of my own family.
     Britain also thought me   as a "first-ever in the family at university,"
as an American graduate student, studying at a Canadian university,  who worked
on an English  archaeological site (Peterborough)  for her dissertation.   As I
taught the survey that autumn,  the image of the  blue-uniformed borstal boys
(as they were called), whom the excavation had contracted from the regional
reformatory to do the heavy work of our  excavation, haunted me.  As we
students trowelled, the borstal boys stood in rows  laboriously shovelling, not
unlike  the Egyptian fellahs to be seen in  early twentieth-century photographs
of British excavations in Egypt.  General Pitt-Rivers  never lets go, I
thought.  


GHOSTS AND STUDENTS
    These ghosts from past and present haunted  me as I tried to
understand the power of the medieval English survey over the students who
seemed to sit so complacently in front of me. They came in throngs from
pre-law, the  London Abroad program; they were  government majors,history
majors,  and English majors and  a good number were from ROTC.  The students
desired  that exceptional story that they already knew:  law, parliament,
monarchy, progress, Pax Britannia. They desired this even though the majority
of them were self-identified Irish-Americans who had chosen to come to the
university of the "fighting Irish."   
       At that time there existed no Irish Studies Program at the University,
no curricular means by which these students could come to  understand the
co-construction of "Irishness" and "Englishness."   Seamus Deane, who now heads
such a program at Notre Dame, calls this persistent, timeless denial of
"Irishness" for the "Irish-American" "a kind of self-imposed cultural
starvation, almost a hunger strike."[7]   Was
I teaching cannibals, then, who turned against the abandoning, colonized
"mother country" and ate her in the football stadium?  Irishness was good to
eat! 
      That curricular musing  got me to thinking  of the space where the
"fighting Irish" fight:  the football stadium, the  libidinal, economic and
ideological heart of the Notre Dame campus;  a place of enclosure, green and
idyllic; a pastoral space.  There is my clue, I thought:  the space of the
survey  works like the pastoral, a green, protected space, like the football
stadium, where  conflict  can be repeated and contained.  The survey  not only
assured students of Englishness, but also,  that most of civilization still
lies shaded under the sturdy, capacious, seemingly eternal canopy of the
British oak.  Safe, secure, idyllic, the space of the survey promised the
reproduction  of order, of monarchy, law, parliament, world power, even the
"fighting Irish."   There was my curricular challenge.   Could I work to move
the survey out of the cultural shade of  the British oak, or is the very notion
of a medieval English survey constitutive of such trees, helping  to make the
British oak visible, just as the British oak, the pastoral, makes the survey
visible? [8]




AFTER NATURE
     The problem of visibility and performance in the survey continued to haunt
me as I made my various awkward adjustments to it over the semesters. In 1991 I
thought I might have found  the answer to my curricular  problems in  Marilyn
Strathern's  study After Nature:  English kinship in the late twentieth
century.  Strathern, an anthropologist, traces the historic epistemology of
Thatcher's statement ("There is no such thing as society.  There are individual
men and women and there are families") and considers its cultural implications.
She locates in those words a rupture  which she describes as  "After Nature,"
meaning an epoch in which individuality no longer reproduces individuality, in
which  there is no future due to the "demise of the reproductive model of the
modern epoch which was  "a model not just of the procreation of persons but for
conceptualising the future" (Strathern, 193).
          Somehow Strathern seemed to me to converge oddly  on Thatcher.  So
convinced that "After Nature"  marked an epistemic break,  Strathern  failed
to interrogate it  as yet one more move in a neo-imperial production with/over
the Englishness of national  identity.  Such odd convergence of left- and
right-wing analysis, suggested that another politics might be in question here;
politics of race.  Paul Gilroy in his study There Ain't No Black in the
Union Jack has analyzed just such strange left-right convergences
in the emergence postcolonial racial politics of Britain after World War II .
[9 ]   My guess was that both Thatcher and
Strathern would seemingly rather "disappear" "English society," rather than see
it rendered vulnerable to  or shattered by--what?   This question would not let
go of my historical sense and I decided to go back to the journal Past and
Present, once the "source" of historiography for me during my graduate
studies to see if a critical reading of the journal as a symptom and not a
source would help me to understand this fear of shattering.  

PASTORAL PAST AND PRESENT
     I needed to return to Past and Present  in an effort to
understand what kind of history it performed in the wake of the loss of the Raj
and  the rise of a new  British racism in the 1960s and 70s. Its  first issue,
as I have mentioned,  appeared in February 1952.  The editors subtitled it: "a
journal of scientific history."  In the dysphoria of decolonization and the
emerging Cold War,  British Marxists looked to the ancient  historian Polybius
whose belief in the historical discipline could, according to the editorial
introduction,   help historians in the present to "face coming events with
confidence."  
    What struck me about the  the medieval contributions to the journal in its
first years was the obsession with questions about the historical identity and
socioeconomic  class of Robin Hood.  So intense was this debate that  the first
anniversary volume of  fifteen essays  culled from the first twenty years of
the journal  featured  five essays, or one-third of the volume, devoted to
Robin Hood.  What could be better than the fantasy of  a medieval  English
peasant to forestall the intimate shattering that might occur if the
postcolonial  loss of an imagined  national rurality which had come to reside
in India were fully avowed?   Both academic and popular culture --the BBC
series also produced and programmed its famous  Robin Hood series at this same
time-- melancholically held onto Robin Hood to avoid a sense of historical
loss.    
        The  editorial  obsession with Robin Hood  at the journal provided me
a way into understanding the pastoral politics of English America.   I detect
in this return of Robin Hood to the pages of Past and Present   a
pastoral move among  British historians.[10]
Indeed, the project of founding the  journal  Past and Present was
itself a pastoral move, the obsession with Robin Hood being one of the medieval
effects of the move.  The strong desire to locate Robin Hood  under the
pastoral shade of the medieval past at that  moment, in 1952, has everything to
do with the culture of decolonization in England.  What kind of desire is this
desire of English historians for English peasants?   Here we have to look at
what phantasmatic histories were lost in England with the loss of the Raj.  My
argument is compressed here for purposes of time and its main point  is that
England lost an imagined  rural past with the loss of  India. 
      Put very briefly:  to write a progressive history of national freedom in
the nineteenth century, English scholars appropriated German scholarship on the
Teutonic village community as a guide for imagining Saxon villages as the
laboratory for democracy.  British scholars in the India Service who grappled
to frame tenurial policies in Indian villages then extended the narrow concept
of Teutonic village community  developed in Anglo-Saxon studies to encompass
the Aryan community  (Biddick 1995).   Publications such as Village
Communities in East and West (1871) by Sir Henry Maine, a classicist,
jurist, and member of the Viceroy's Council in India, helped to produce India
as the rural past of England and England as the colony's  national future.  In
a paradoxical way the medieval English village community was invented by the
India Service. 
         Back in England, as its countryside grew more industrialized, this
imperially  informed notion of the peasant village community could lend itself
as a Romantic emblem attractive to both liberal and conservatives in
Parliamentary debates over colonial land settlements in the mid-nineteenth
century.  Medieval English peasant studies, so important to English
constitutional historians,  such as Maitland, returned again, not surprisingly,
with force at decolonization,  which brought with it the loss of the rural
phantasmatic.  English historians labored to recover the medieval English
village and,  in so doing,   to work out the problems of continuity and change
for an "imperial-national" culture undergoing decolonization.  Their
historiographic  labors bore directly on a work of public culture to refigure
the sites at which much nineteenth-century peasant history had been produced.
The peasant historiography that emerged in the post-War period in the pages of
Past and Present tried to resurrect the lost  past by disavowing its
loss  and putting Robin Hood in its place.  The pages of Past and
Present moved the discourse of the English peasant to a non-place, to the
site of Robin Hood, who, if he could be given an archival identity and class
status, could be made the visible father of a new "English" rural history.
This non-place, however, as  Michel de Certeau has warned, "forbids history
from speaking of society and death--in other words, from being history" (69).

          How to make this new phantasmatic rurality, which cannot speak death,
reproduce itself historiographically?    In 1964 Joan Thirsk, a noted agrarian
historian and member of the editorial board,  made a clarion call  in the pages
of Past and Present for English family history. English family history
would go on to become a historiographic industry.  The debates in family
history  were actually discussions of  Englishness  and how early it could be
detected. Studies such  as Alan Macfarlane's The Origins of English
Individualism:  The Family, Property, and Social Transition (1979)
exemplify the genre.  Macfarlane would locate the formation of the  distinctive
English family in the twelfth century, a century, perhaps not so coincidentally
associated with Robin Hood.
        Ever reactive, albeit in its historiographic unconscious, Past and
Present began to take on yet another issue  of racial politics in its
pages,  to construct another site where Englishness could be regarded as
distinctive, that is,  the history of crime.  In the November 1983 issue, just
two short years after the "explosions" at Brixton and the publication of Lord
Scarman's report on the racial uprisings, a report which  Paul  Gilroy
considers "a crucial document in the history of the discourse of the black
community.  It set the official seal on a definition of the origins and extent
of black crime and tied these to what were felt to be distinct patterns of
politics and family life, characteristic of black culture" (Gilroy: 104).
Lawrence Stone  (1983) wrote a review essay on historical patterns of crime in
England.  In his concluding remarks  he claimed: '"We are infinitely more
destructive in war than our ancestors, but in our daily lives the English at
least are also, for some reason, still far less prone to casual violence"
(22-23).    Read this against those "explosions," the "mindless" violence of
Brixton, and it  is again possible to see how the Englishness of the family and
the Englishness of peaceful everyday life lay protected in the white shade of
the pages of Past and Present.

BIRMINGHAM CULTURAL STUDIES

         The pastoral politics of Past and Present did not go
unchallenged in public culture.  The more Robin Hood,  the more cadaverous
Past and Present  became. The disavowal of loss at the heart of this
journal  accounts, I think,  for its failure to articulate with another
Birmingham project, that of  Marxist cultural studies as carried out at the
Birmingham Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies in the  1960s and 70s. [11] 
     The Center was founded at the University of Birmingham in 1964, a mere
twelve years after the founding of Past and Present.   Its students
tracked the study of racism, ethnocentrism, nationalism, and ongoing
imperialisms as processes, not events.  It attended to migrant and sexual
histories, popular music, film, and television.  In particular, the Center
took a critical stance on how the "family" was being used to stand for a
national narrative of  England in the 1960s and 1970s,  such that the family
acted as a pastoral space in which political processes could be converted into
natural, instinctive, seemingly invisible processes, acts of national nature.
Works produced under the influence of the Center traced  how the families of
British Blacks came to be labelled as  pathological, a source of growing "black
criminality." 
    How is it that, in spite of gestures and invocations, the two Birmingham
projects did not really articulate, did not join their national and imperial
critiques?  This question raises the very different positioning of the family
in the two projects and it is to that positioning of the family I will now
turn.   


THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE THE HOME MOVIE (Jarman 1987: 108) 


 To focus on the contest I would like to turn to two films
influenced by the Birmingham Cultural Studies school.   The  films,
Handsworth Songs (1986)  by the Black Audio Collective and  The Last
of England  (1987) by Derek Jarman   can be used as examples of this
counter-pastoral politics (Auguiste 1988;Kruger 1988;  Gilroy and Pines 1988).
[12] Together these films work  like a
double-edged blade that exposes the roots of the pastoral family tree of
Englishness to migrant and sexual histories.  Both films splice  family scenes
from  home-movie footage, to create a counter-pastoral space.
Handsworth Songs  can be read as a kind of video museum  for
West-Indian migration into Britain.  It tells a history of the Handsworth
uprising of 1985 through a diasporan history of West-Indian migration, largely
post-war, to Britain.  The family footage works diasporically in the film to
show not an essentialist West-Indian family of tradition which would
deteriorate, become "pathological,"   upon  its arrival in the metropolis.
Rather,   home-movie footage constitutes the family as a contact zone that
articulates with a range of spaces that cannot be easily categorized as  public
or private and with times that cannot be easily categorized as developmental.
The Black Audio Collective nested  home-movie footage  of a  young infant being
washed in a tub,  a young man and two women in a living room,  two young girls
with their parents in a living room into an unfolding montage of archival
footage ranging from splices of post-War inter-racial dance clubs,
disembarking immmigrant Calypso stars,  labor parades and rallies along with
local  footage of community spaces, such as grade-school, nursery, health
clinic, factory, reggae clubs, green markets.  This material is further folded
into studies of black-and-white family photographs of weddings,  school days
etc.  The home-movie footage, family photographs and  archival footage of
migration and labor history are cut against contemporary  BBC footage (stripped
of audio) of the Handsworth uprisings, the famous "swamping" speech of
Thatcher,  and of documentary footage of community-group and neighborhood
commentary on the uprisings. 
     The evocation of the family through home-movies in Handsworth Songs
refuses any essentialized notion of the family and produces the family
instead as a relay in a complicated grid of migrant, labor, racial, and sexual
histories. The family itself becomes diasporic within a diasporic film.  The
voice-over over the last home-footage to be spliced into the film underscores
this diasporic staging.  We see the last home-movie cut after we hear the story
of the death of Cynthia Jarret, a victim of police violence, as  told by her
family.  A woman's voice speaks over cuts of the funeral cortege interspliced
with family -movie footage  of a father, mother and two daughters.  The
voice-over  that accompanies these splices recites the poetic words of a young
West Indian woman: "then I slip through the crack to be shamed by the sea,
Night-time I am the sea, and if I walk from the shoreline to cast it, it will
fill my shoes, washing my journey away." 
     In staging the family as historical journey, Handsworth Songs
blacks out the shade of the pastoral tree that  would seek to collapse itself
into the family tree--to root  nation into  Englishness.  This ideological
family tree is cut down in the collage of  Handsworth Songs.  A
voice-over that accompanies another splice of home-movies of a living room
scene says as much:  "There are sands to shift, dry woods to sweep away, and
they said to each other, here we will be shoulder to shoulder, and we will
survey the world in ascension, and one day the world will come to us."  The
pastoral is dismantled and its dry timber carried away in order to make the
space for different histories and articulations that do not work through the
family as an essentialized "natural/national" entity whose purpose is to
occlude imperial relations.  
     Derek Jarman uses home-movie footage in The Last of England not to
cut down the pastoral family tree but to show the costs of its politics.  He
focuses on the pastoral site of the post-war white English suburban family, and
through splicing his father's home-movies shows that pastoral suburban site to
be one of devastation, an extension of war, terrorism, imperialism, libidinal
exclusion.  
     Jarman's family history is in itself an interesting montage of migration
and imperialism.  On the paternal side, his great-grandfather left Devon to
migrate to New Zealand in the mid-nineteenth century.  Jarman's father came
from New Zealand to Britain supposedly for a brief period in the 1920s but
ended up in the RAF for World War II.  He was a successful bomber pilot and
learned to work a camera on his bombing forays.  He hated the English,
according to his son, and resented the pantomime of accent and gesture he had
to adopt to pass in England.  On the maternal side, Jarman's grandparents had
made their fortune in the tea trade in Calcutta and returned to England to
retire.  When Jarman was  10 years old, his father was seconded as a pilot to
Pakistan and the family accompanied him.   Jarman retained vivid memories of
that trip. 
        It is mistake, I think, to read the beautiful color footage of the
Jarman home-movies as a site of the pastoral spliced into his unremittingly
desolate scenes which  insist on the terrorism and desolation of bureacratic
and bureacratized life under Thatcher.  I think Jarman, instead, is asking us
to read the home-movies as the site of enclosure and the open-secret that
constitutes violence and secrecy within the suburban enclosure of the family
and gives the permission for the extension of this violence beyond the English
hedge--an extension that Jarman shows in detail.  
      Jarman does, however, twice stage a pastoral moment in The Last of
England.  Jarman uses these pastoral stagings strategically to shatter the
open secret of the pastoral family tree which is also about the good order of
English sexuality,  that is the Englishness of orderly, heterosexuality.
Jarman stages the first pastoral scene with a cut to a painting by Caravaggio
entitled Perverse Love.  The painting of a beautiful male angel lies on the
ground and subsequently a young punk proceeds to masturbate on, fuck and then
stomp on the painting.  The same punk then moves around the abandoned lot in
which the painting lies, in the glare of  a brightly burning flare, which
seemingly burns up and exposes any lingering shade of the pastoral.
     Jarman stages yet another pastoral scene that  criss-crosses disorderly
sexuality with the pastoral space of the Union Jack.  A  well-suited  (yuppy?)
drunken disco-goer tries to fuck a masked terrorist of uncertain gender on a
bottle-strewn Union Jack.  The sexual scene dissipates in drunken frustration.
Here, once again, Jarman seems to be exposing and questioning the good order of
sexuality that would come under the shade of the pastoral family tree of
Englishness. 
     The Black Audio Collective and Derek Jarman, who filmed as Thatcher
claimed "there are individual men and women and there are families" and as
Strathern delivered her lectures of "After Nature," were telling different and
powerful migrant and sexual histories that foregrounded the family in
counter-pastoral spaces.   As histories of excluded bodies  these
counter-pastoral films challenged the politics of visibility  which serve as
the conditions of possibility for the English model of Nature, Society,
Individual. and for a pastoral historiography of Englishness as written in the
pages of Past and Present. These migrant and sexual montages of
Handsworth Songs and The Last of England dispelled the shade of
the English  family tree.  These films provided me with the inspiration to
attempt to do the same with the medieval English survey.  



TEACHING THE SURVEY 1995

          What, then, are North American medievalists to do, who are required
to teach the medieval English survey?  How can we imagine a pedagogy that
short-circuits the performance of English America, walks out of the shade of
Past and Present, out of the shadow of the football stadium?   I return
once again to Robin Hood to give these questions one more pass.   Not
surprisingly,  Robin Hood had returned yet again in the early 1990s to pose the
problem of English America.   The Hollywood film Robin Hood Prince of
Thieves  (1991)  devotes itself to  reminding its Anglo-American audience
of "Englishness." It is not by coincidence that the first words of Robin Hood
(Kevin Costner), who as a Hollywood star is already intertextually
interpellated into the American  neo-imperial phantasmatic through his starring
role in Dances with Wolves  are the following spoken to his Muslim
captors: "This is English courage."  Shot in England during the Persian Gulf
War, in which England served as an ally to the United States,  it is  not by
coincidence that the audience follows  the arrows of Robin Hood as they make
their way to the target through the missile-nose view that had become familiar
from CNN coverage of scud-missile attacks  in Desert Storm.  This scud-archery
of Robin Hood became the signature special-effect.  It  appeared in the
promotional trailers for the film  and  were also spliced into the  film's
music-video  "Worth Dying For" (Bryan Adams) which  also concluded the film.
      The moral order of "Worth Dying For"  suggests   once again that we are
dealing with English medieval studies in North America as a concessionary
narrative for the truth of Englishness  (Biddick 1995).    On the first day of
class in the spring semester  of 1995, we began with the video "Worth Dying
For."   We talked about death, the pastoral, and the historical production of
Englishness.  We ended  the semester  with  a reading of Michael Ondaatje's
The English Patient (1992), a story  set at a Tuscan villa in the summer
of 1945.   It weaves back and forth between rewritings of Kipling's Kim
and The Last of the Mohicans.    Ondaatje perceptively calls World War
II  "the last medieval war" (69).     In this mystery story  that hovers over
the badly burnt, "unidentifiable"  "carbon-like" body of an English  patient,
Ondaatje seems to suggest that there there are no more  conditions of
possibility   for producing Englishness.  Writing in 1992, Ondaatje knows, of
course,  that he is wrong.   It is with this misrecognition that I drafted yet
again another version of the the "medieval English survey" for the spring
semester of 1995.  That syllabus is appended below.




ENGLAND AND ITS OTHERS
A COURSE FOR BELATED TRAVELERS 

IN AN AGE OF COLONIAL DISSOLUTION

 the trouble with the Engenglish is that their hiss hiss history happened
overseas, so they don't know what it means. 
Salman Rushdie,  Satanic Verses (Viking, 1988), p. 343


PROBLEM OF THE COURSE:CHRONOPOLITICS
   What time is it in the medieval England survey?   Are we so sure of the
chronology of medieval English history:  410 ACE (the withdrawal of Roman
rule), 1066 ACE (the Norman Conquest), and all that? Whom and what do these
chronologies repress and  how were they constituted?  Why were English
chronologies so challenged in the twelfth century and again in the late
twentieth century?

Undergraduate Surveys leave unmarked their chronopolitcs, the politics of time
and timing.  Chronologies are the effects of constituting,engendering,
sexualizing, racializing "historical subjects."  To mark and re-articulate the
chronopolitics of the medieval English survey, this course will think about
various time-telling devices used in the cultural work of time-telling:  the
prophecies of Merlin,  the archives of the Public Record Office,  the
time-bombs dropped on London in World War II, the home-movies of migrant
colonials--these are a few of  the time-telling devices we will think about
this semester. 
     Why is telling time in the survey so important? Does the time of the
medieval England survey course have everything to do (still) with the
question" what time is it in the British Empire? "  How is the medieval England
survey course  a site, or itinerary for belated travel in a post-colonial age?
Do we need to ask further, where  is Greenwich mean time?

 "We then have a contested conceptual territory where the nation's people must
be thought in double-time; the people are the historical 'objects' of a
nationalist pedagogy, giving the discourse an authority that is based on the
pre-given or constituted historical origin in the past; the people are also
subjects of a process of signification that must erase any prior or originary
prsence of the nation-people to demonstrate the prodigious, living principles
of the people as contemporaneity: as that sign of the present through which
national life is redeemed and iterated as a reproductive process. "  (p. 145)

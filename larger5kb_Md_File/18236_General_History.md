| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course will offer students an integrated introduction to the
political, social, intellectual, and cultural history  
---|---  
  
| of Europe from mid-seventeenth century to the present. Particular attention
will be devoted to analyzing  
---|---  
  
| Europe's relationship to the wider world. This is a lower-division lecture
and discussion course. Lectures will  
---|---  
  
| amplify (or qualify) the assigned reading. The latter will form the basis
for weekly, 50-minute discussion sections  
---|---  
  
| \- which in some respects may be seen as constituting the core of History
113. There will be an attempt to  
---|---  
  
| integrate Western music with its historical settings.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  To succeed in this course, students must be willing to complete all
assignments in a conscientious and timely  
---|---  
  
| fashion.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  There will be four graded assignments: two short (roughly 5-page)
analytical papers; an in-class midterm; and an  
---|---

**HIST 207** ** _Introduction to Intellectual History: The Idea of Community
in Western Culture_**

---|---  
  
|  
John Toews  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  The course is designed to introduce students to the historical and
comparative methods of the history of ideas  
---|---  
  
| through an analysis of four critical moments in Western thinking about the
social bond expressed in the texts of  
---|---  
  
| Plato, Saint Augustine, Rousseau and Freud. Close readings of individual
texts will be framed by reconstructions  
---|---  
  
|  of broader historical contexts at crucial turning points in Western
culture, and in relation to contemporary  
---|---  
  
| American conceptions of community.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  Some background in Western history ( as in HIST 111, 112, 113) would
certainly be useful, but is not required.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Students will write eight, short (2 pages), weekly response papers in
preparation for discussion sections, and

|  
Bruce Hevly  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course considers the history of nuclear weapons, primarily from the
point of view of their development in  
---|---  
  
| the United States, from the early days of atomic physics to the arms control
era. We will aim to integrate  
---|---  
  
| intellectual, political, military and social history; the instructor is a
historian of science and technology and the  
---|---  
  
| course content reflects this basic area of expertise. Among the topics to be
discussed are: the development of  
---|---  
  
| atomic and nuclear physics, and ideas about the potential of nuclear energy,
from the turn of the century through  
---|---  
  
|  the 1930's; the Manhattan Project and German nuclear weapons projects; the
US decision to employ nulcear  
---|---  
  
| weapons in August 1945; the postwar creation of the Atomic Energy
Commission, its federal cities and its  
---|---  
  
| national laboratory system; civil defense; the Oppenheimer hearings and the
decision to build fusion weapons;  
---|---  
  
| weapons testing and arms control, up to the Anti-Ballistic Missle Treaty.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  No prerequisites. Ideally, some of the students in the class will have a
good background in physical science, and  
---|---  
  
|  some will be well versed in European, American, or military history. People
with a variety of prior training should  
---|---  
  
|  succeed in the class, and have contributions to make to it.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Lectures will comprise the basic structure of the course, and attendance at
lectures will be vital. Discussion  
---|---  
  
| sections will be devoted to the analysis of primary sources, to discussion
of writing assignments, and to  
---|---  
  
| follow-up questions from lectures. Assignments will include short writing
projects as part of discussion  
---|---  
  
| preparation (typically a page or less); a book review; and an essay
analyzing one of the major decisions or  
---|---  
  
| discoveries made during the nuclear age. There will also be two midterms and
a final examination.

| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  The ideas, persons, and institutions that contributed to key developments
in 19th and early 20th century  
---|---  
  
| physics, astrophysics, and astronomy are studied in the context of social,
institutional, philosophical,  
---|---  
  
| intellectual, personal and national settings. The major scientific topics
covered are the unification of electricity  
---|---  
  
| and magnetism, the development of thermodynamics, the rise of astrophysics,
the nature of nebulae and stars,  
---|---  
  
| quantum mechanics, relativity and its application to the expanding Universe,
and the opening of the  
---|---  
  
| electromagnetic spectrum in astronomy. Common themes are the search for
unification in theories, particles  
---|---  
  
| versus waves, scientific styles, and the relations between science and other
aspects of society such as military,  
---|---  
  
| industry, government, the arts, and technology. This class draws a mixture
of science/engineering students and  
---|---  
  
| non-technical majors and aims to be effective for both audiences by offering
various options for assignments  
---|---  
  
| and helping each type of student to appreciate the "other side's" approach
to gathering facts and constructing  
---|---  
  
| knowledge. A principal goal of the course is to expose the technical majors
to historical values and the liberal  
---|---  
  
| arts majors to scientific values and beliefs. Students learn to appreciate
how science has shaped our modern  
---|---  
  
| culture, as well as how non-scientific aspects of culture have shaped our
modern science.

Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  History 388 is designed as an intensive introduction to the study of
history for new or prospective majors. It  
---|---  
  
| emphasizes the basic skills of reading, analysis and communication (both
verbal and written) that are central to  
---|---  
  
| the historian's craft. Basic techniques of historical study that will form
the core of the course include use of  
---|---  
  
| source materials, an understanding of how historians work with their sources
and the planning, research and  
---|---  
  
| writing of historical essays.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  Since the subject of this offering is Socrates, some knowledge of ancient
Greek history will be useful but is not a  
---|---  
  
| prerequisite. More important are (1) a desire to practice the skills of
being an historian, (2) a readiness to attend  
---|---  
  
| and participate actively in every class, and (3) some curoisity about
Socrates and his polis of Athens.

| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course will introduce new and prospective history majors to the
variety of methods and perspectives that  
---|---  
  
| inform scholarly study of the past. The aim is to strengthen the basic
skills of reading, research, oral  
---|---  
  
| communication, and written analysis that are crucial to the historian's
craft. These skills will be developed by  
---|---  
  
| exploring the history of slavery and the slave trade in Africa and beyond.
We will assess and debate the various  
---|---  
  
| issues raised by this history through close examination of a range of
sources, including an anthropologist's  
---|---  
  
| reflections on the Haitian revolution; historical essays on slavery and the
slave trade; first-hand descriptions of  
---|---  
  
| the trade; an ex-slave's autobiography; and a historical novel by a Nigerian
feminist.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  A desire to practice the skills of being a historian and a curiosity to

**HIST 390** ** _Colloquium in History and Science: Isaac Newton and the
Scientific Revolution_**  
---  
  
|  Thomas Hankins  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  Our subject will be the Scientific Revolution of the 17th and 18th
centuries with special attention to the life and  
---|---  
  
| work of Isaac Newton. We will begin by comparing different historiographical
approaches to the Scientific  
---|---  
  
| Revolution and will see how they provide insights into Newton's
achievements. This is not a thorough-going  
---|---  
  
| treatment of the historical literature on Newton's work and influence.
Rather, here we plan to use this topic to  
---|---  
  
| illuminate some of the changes in method and approach used by working
historians of science over this century,  
---|---  
  
| with an emphasis on recent work.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  This seminar is required for the History of Phiolosophy and Science major.
Other students may enroll, but majors  
---|---  
  
|  will have priority. There are no prerequisites, although some background in
science or the history of science will  
---|---  
  
|  be helpful.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Students will read extensively and discuss their reading in class. They
will write a book report and a substantial

---|---  
  
| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This is a seminar for honors history students, its purpose to introduce
students to historiography, sometimes  
---|---  
  
| called the "history of history." Historians do not work in isolation, but
rather in conversation--with each other,  
---|---  
  
| with thinkers in other fields, and with the events and moods of their times.
Historians also confront recurring  
---|---  
  
| philosophical issues: Is objectivity possible, or even desirable? Why should
we study the past at all? In  
---|---  
  
| reflecting together on these issues, we'll attempt to clarify you own
commitments as students of the past. One of  
---|---  
  
| the richest (and most contentious) historiographical streams in U.S. history
is the study of slavery. We will read  
---|---  
  
| several general articles on the practice of history over the past century,
applying what we learn there to a number  
---|---  
  
|  of key works on slavery.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  Acceptance to and participation in the history department honors program
required.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Class Assignments and Grading**  
---|---  
  
|  Reading and discussion are the core of this course; active, critical
reading is essential to lively, productive  
---|---  
  
| discussion in class. Students will also write four short (about 5 pages)
papers, based on the assigned readings.  
---|---  
  
| All four papers must be completed in order to pass the course. Steady
attendance is central to our group process  
---|---  
  
|  as well as to each individual's success.

| **  
Class Description**  
---|---  
  
|  This course explores the social, political, and cultural forces that have
effected change in the modern Middle  
---|---  
  
| East. We will begin with the Ottoman Empire's necessary adaptations to a
transformed world at the dawn of the  
---|---  
  
| 19th century. The course will carry through the varied responses of Middle
Eastern societies to Western  
---|---  
  
| intrusions and the pressures of "modernization" and globalization that
continue today. The course will explore  
---|---  
  
| the world view that Islam and cultural traditions have produced and how they
have shaped the process of  
---|---  
  
| change. We will study current issues such as the Israel-Palestine
confrontation and Islamic "fundamentalism."  
---|---  
  
| One goal of this course is to draw comparisons with other societies facing
similar processes of adaptation to  
---|---  
  
| change.  
---|---  
  
| **  
Recommended Preparation**  
---|---  
  
|  A prior global history course or previous study of a non-Western region's
history is helpful but not necessary.

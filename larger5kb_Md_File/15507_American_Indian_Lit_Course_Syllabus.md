> Though this is not required, there are links to many websites with
information about the tribes or topics that we will be looking at. As there is
not enough time to adequately cover many of the subjects and issues in depth
that are raised by our texts, you will be able to learn more through some of
these websites. Additionally, you will be able to obtain Indian perspectives
on the texts, cultures and issues we'll discuss besides only mine and fellow
classmates.

>

> In this course we will be acquiring familiarity with the literature of a few
contemporary American Indian authors. These readings will be supplemented with
critical writings about American Indian literature or Indian representation.
Most all of the readings, critical and creative alike, will be written by
American Indian authors. Some of the goals of the course are that the student
gains an understanding of the milieu and contexts in which these literatures
were produced, how they are received, and the ways that the material helps to
voice the author's concerns as an American Indian and a writer. Throughout the
quarter some of the guiding considerations we will keep in mind are: Indian
Literature as a form of resistance, "resistance to what? who? and why?"; The
images that have been generated by non-Indians in America over the years and
how these have shaped Indian experiences and the policies that impact Indian
Country; How the authors may have been influenced by and responding to the
images of Indians that circulate in American society; How their various tribal
enculturations contribute to, shape or speak through the texts; what the main
themes are that the author is engaging? Identity? Racism? The problems of
acculturation, of bi-culturality? And finally, what themes are accented when
the book is put in dialogue with critical material. Since one of our areas of
concern will be how some of these authors are responding to the images of
Indians that circulate in American popular culture we will also be analyzing
some of these images. This may include advertisements, films, music, comic
books, etc.... One of the main areas we will be investigating is the extent to
which ideas of Indianess inform our ideas of what an "American" is. Students
are encouraged to bring in images such as advertisements or book covers that
they may encounter.

**_Assignments_**

> **Exams:**   There will be two take home exams, one at mid-terms and one at
finals. Or if you are a junior or senior who will be applying to graduate
school and would like to work on a sustained piece of writing, you can choose
to write a ten page paper and forgo the exams. If you choose the paper you
must let me know prior to the midterm exam.

>

> **Responses**   Each student will be required to turn in on Wednesday a
response to the readings for that week, except for the first week and exam
weeks. There are a total of 7 responses, one for each text. Each response
should be about 500-1000 words depending on your mood, your take on the
reading and your verbosity. However, if you are a creative person, who is a
poet, short-story writer or graphic artist, your response paper can be
comprised of those elements if they demonstrate an engaging response to the
reading. In the past people have turned in elaborate and simple art work of a
character, image, etc..., poetry that reflects how they feel as a native or a
non-native person learning about these topics, fiction, etc....

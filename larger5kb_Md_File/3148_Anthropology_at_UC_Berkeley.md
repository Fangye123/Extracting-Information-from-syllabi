[L. Hager](hager.html) 4 units, TuTh: 2-3:30, Wheeler Auditorium

  
  
This course will provide the student with an introduction to the primary
theories and concepts relating to Biological Anthropology. The course will
cover the three main subdisciplines of Biological Anthropology: Human Biology,
Paleoanthropology, and Primatology. Course material will be introduced to
students in a variety of ways, including visual presentations (in lecture and
section) and hands-on experiences (in section).

  
  
There will be three hours of lecture and one hour of discussion section per
week.

  
  
**Prerequisites:** None.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 2: INTRODUCTION TO ARCHAEOLOGY**

[ M. Conkey](conkey.html) 4 units, TuTh: 3:30-5, F 295 Haas

  
  
**Students must sign up for a section through TeleBEARS (see _Schedule of
Classes_ for listings). Section work is 33% of grade.**  
  
An introduction to the methods, goals, and theoretical concepts of
archaeology. The course outlines how archaeologists make behavioral
interpretations using the cultural materials of past human societies. Topics
include the history of archaeology; developing a research design; field
methods; laboratory analyses; chronology; and reconstructing past economic and
social organizations. The course and major events of prehistory are discussed
and how archaeologists have come to understand the rise of human culture, the
origins of agriculture, the development of cities and complex societies are
considered. Examples of survey, excavation and analytical techniques will be
presented as part of the class.

  
  
**Prerequisites:** None.

  
  
**Requirements:** One mid-term and final (each 33% of grade). Participation in
the discussion sections is mandatory. Archaeological problems will be assigned
as part of the discussion sections, and section exercises will be turned in
and graded (33% of grade).

**ANTHRO 3: INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY**

[N. Graburn](graburn.html) 4 units, TuTh: 9:30-11, Wheeler Auditorium

  
  
This year's Anthropology 3 will use the recent work of the Berkeley faculty
and a few others to illuminate recent trends in anthropology. It introduces a
comparative framework for understanding a range of ways of life, including
urban, peasant, horticultural, pastoralist and hunter-gatherer societies; but
the emphasis will be contemporary complex societies and their social problems,
including Japan, China, USA, South Africa, Mexico, India and Russia, and post-
colonial peoples of Africa and the Americas. The course will focus on
anthropological research ethics and methods, and issues of gender, social
change, and the globalizing socio-cultural system. Videos and slides as well
as guest speakers will supplement the case studies. Adjuncts to the course
include weekly section meetings with exciting young GSIs, boring lecture
summary handouts, essential Black Lightning Notes, and possibly a voluntary
ELL Class on "How to Ace Courses at Cal."  
  
**Prerequisites:** None.

  
  
**Requirements:** Grades will be based on one in-class midterm (30%), one
ungraded (but compulsory) genealogy assignment and a series of short research
assignments spread out over the term (30%), and a final exam (40%). Overall
grades may be raised or lowered up to 5% for discussion section attendance and
participation.

**ANTHRO 24: FRESHMAN SEMINAR: "PHOTOGRAPH AS SOCIAL DOCUMENT"**

[ S. Brandes](brandes.html) 1 unit, W: 1-2, 15, 2224 Piedmont

  
  
They say that a photograph is worth a thousand words. Since the invention of
photography over a hundred and fifty years ago, images have been used,
together with text, to provide documentary evidence. Nonetheless, photographs
are open to multiple interpretations and subject to editorial bias on the part
of both photographer and viewer. This seminar explores some of the uses and
abuses of photography in journalism and social research. Students will be
required to participate in class discussions and complete an original
photographic essay consisting of about a dozen photographs, with commentary or
captions, that explore a theme or tell a story.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 112: SPECIAL TOPICS IN BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY: "BIOARCHAEOLOGY"**

[L. Hager](hager.html) 4 units, TuTh: 9:30-11 102 Stanley

  
  
Skeletal material from archaeological sites provide a wealth of information on
the life histories of past human populations. Bones and teeth leave a record
of many aspects of an individual's life history including their age, sex, and
overall health. This course discusses what information the skeletal system can
give us about past people and the interpretations that can be made when these
biological data are placed within an archaeological context. We will examine
major issues in bioarchaeology, including age and sex determination, how to
identify stress, infections, injuries and levels of physical activity,
analysis of biological distance, the chemical analysis of bone, and inferences
on past behaviors such as sex/gender roles. Throughout the course we will use
case studies of human populations from different geographical and temporal
locations in the reconstruction of many past cultures. In addition, we will
examine archaeological samples from different subsistence bases as we consider
the impact on the human skeleton of the transition from hunting-gathering to a
sedentary lifestyle with the shift to urbanism and agriculturally based
economies.

**ANTHRO 112-2: SPECIAL TOPICS IN BIOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY: "IDENTITY IN THE
POST-GENOMIC WORLD"**

P. Billings 4 units, TuTh 3:30-5, 122 Wheeler

  
  
The study of DNA has produced formulations of human identity. One involves DNA
sequences that are highly variable. Assessment of several of these areas can
produce a unique genetic fingerprint. Another arises from the typing of many
or possibly all human genes by a genetic microchip or similar method. This
information, possibly developed as early as conception, then accompanies the
individual throughout life and afterwards. We will familiarize ourselves with
the technologies used and then explore their impacts on the individual and on
sex, birth, development, medicine, death and other key contexts that shape
identity and the individual. If fully applied, the information contained
within the human genome will substantially alter human identity.  
  
The course is restricted to upper-division students.  
  
  
**ANTHRO 114: HISTORY OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL THOUGHT**

[ X. Liu](liu.html) 4 units, MWF: 2-3, 1 LeConte

  
  
This course will present a history of anthropological thought from the mid-
nineteenth century to the mid-twentieth century and will draw upon the major
subdisciplines of anthropology. It will focus both upon the integration of the
anthropological subdisciplines and upon the relationships between these and
other disciplines outside anthropology. Three hours of lecture; one hour of
required discussion section per week.

**ANTHRO 115: INTRODUCTION TO MEDICAL ANTHROPOLOGY **

[N. Scheper-Hughes](nsh.html) 4 units, TuTh: 11-12:30 160 Kroeber

  
  
Medical Anthropology applies anthropological thinking and practice to the
study of pain, illness, suffering, and healing. It explores the body as
biologically given and culturally and historically situated so that medical
anthropologists can even speak of "local biologies". Medical anthropology
begins from a radical premise of epistemological openness to alternative
understandings of illness, disease, and curing. The course is comparative,
treating illness, misfortune, and healing in a number of societies from
highland New Guinea to urban Japan, but there is also a strong focus is on the
social expressions of illness, misfortune and healing in our own society. Bio-
medicine is treated here as one among a great many effective systems of
medical knowledge. The course will introduce the advanced undergraduate
student to a critically interpretive approach to the field.  
  
The first section of the course constitutes an anthropology of the mindful
body; the social meanings and the social uses of illness; sickness and power;
the regulation and management of dis-eased and distressed bodies and minds;
body, mind and society relations in western/nonwestern medical systems; the
cultural shaping of emotions, memory and healing; the social production of
"new" diseases; the new bio-technologies and the redefinition of life, death
and human value that they bring. Along the way we will explore the logic of
witchcraft and sorcery as explanations of sickness and other unfortunate
events; the power and efficacy of symbols; and a radical treatment of
shamanism. Finally, the course will deal with the vexing topic of poverty,
colonialism and death and the social reproduction of hunger, infant mortality,
and "nervousness" in the heart of the neoliberal global order and in the
world's 8th largest economy: Brazil. In all, medical anthropology is a
critical reflection on the ways that people live, sicken, and die.  
  
**Requirements:** open to upper division undergraduates and to graduate
students in the humanities, social sciences, biological sciences and to 'pre-
med', medical, and public health students. The course assumes a general
background and familiarity with social science concepts and ideas. The reading
schedule is demanding and participation in discussion groups is required. The
final grade is based on a midterm exam, and two short (ten pages each )
research papers, active participation in discussion groups, and a final exam.

**ANTHRO 122E: PEOPLE OF THE ANDES**

[ C. Hastorf ](hastorf.html) 4 units, MWF: 1-2, 155 Kroeber

  
  
One of the most diverse environments in the world hosts rich, intriguing
continuity in its history of human life. With occupation beginning sometime
before 10,000 years B.C., we have evidence for social and ritual complexity in
the archaeological record dating to before 2000 B.C. (B.C.E.). This ebbs and
flows throughout the region up until today, with opposites of rich well
preserved tapestries on the coast 600 B.C. to impoverished foragers
surrounding saline lakes in recent times.  
  
This course follows the evolution of pre-Hispanic and hispanic society in the
Andean region of South America. The lectures and readings emphasize major
political, economic, and social processes in the development of the major
Andean civilizations. Particular attention will be paid to causes of the early
states along the coast of Peru, the development of major politics in the
highlands, how the political and economic systems of the later empires were
based on earlier social structures and elaborate ritual imagery. The
traditions of Chavin, Nazca, Moche, Tiwanaku, Wari, Chimor, and Inka will be
presented. In addition we will study the archaeological sequence to see what
we can learn from this long temporal perspective about modern political
issues.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 128-1: SPECIAL TOPICS IN ANTHROPOLOGY: "PRACTICE IN THE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SIXTH GRADE AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAM"**

[R. Tringham](tringham.html) 4 units, Tu: 9-11, 15, 2224 Piedmont and (choose
one) lab 1 Tu: 3-6-off campus **or** lab 2 W: 1:30-4:30-off campus

  
  
**Meets the method requirement for the anthropology major.**  
  
This course is designed to provide an opportunity for undergraduates to work
with 6th graders in exploring the world of archaeology and multimedia
technology. The students of this course will be expected to mentor the
children in the activities of a newly-established after-school program in
Roosevelt Middle School, Oakland. This program is sponsored and funded by a
collaborative venture of the Interactive University of U.C. Berkeley, the
Oakland Unified School District, and the UC Links Program of UCOP. The program
is directed by Professor Ruth Tringham and managed by Amy Ramsay for the
Archaeological Research Facility and Dept. of Anthropology.

  
  
The after-school program is designed to bring the archaeological experience to
6th graders through the medium of multimedia technology--multimedia authoring,
WWWeb browsing, Virtual Reality Interactive games, etc. This program will be
voluntary for the 6th graders, and is being carried out under the auspices of
the newly established "Village Center" at Roosevelt School which seeks to
encourage the community as well as children in the after school activities.

  
  
The activities of the after-school program will be devised by the students of
this class in collaboration with the children and teachers. These activities
will focus on the interpretation of archaeological materials rather than the
"grand picture" of the past; it will focus on giving archaeology some
immediacy in the children's lives by encouraging them to think of themselves
in relation to their local history and cultural heritage. The activities will
take the form of devising Virtually Real experience, games and stories through
multimedia authoring, as well as "real" role-playing games and scenes around
archaeological themes: excavation and the partial remains of food, fire,
learning, shelter, play, family etc.

  
  
The students of Anthropology 134B will work in close collaboration with the
Graduate Student Section (Anthropology 228B), in which students will be
working with the same 6th grade children in an in-class context. This latter
course is more constrained by the requirements of the school curriculum in
terms of content. We hope in Anthropology 134B to be able to address themes
and topics and ways of looking at the past that are not addressed during their
in-class participation.

  
  
**Prerequisites:** This course will feed into and from a number of
undergraduate courses in archaeology and anthropology, including the
Introduction to Archaeology, and upper division courses on method and theory.
It will also introduce students to issues of pedagogy and public archaeology.
Students from other fields are welcome to participate. Bilingual students are
strongly encouraged to apply. A course in the Introduction to Archaeology
(Anthro 2) or its equivalent and the permission of the instructor (through
interview) are the only prerequisites. Access to an email and Internet account
are essential prerequisites, since an important component of the course will
be frequent consultation of the Course WWWebsite.

  
  
If you have taken previous Multimedia Authoring for Archaeology classes, this
would be greatly to your advantage. Those who have not had any multimedia
technology background will be assisted in catching up through self-paced
tutorials held in the Multimedia Authoring Center for Teaching in Anthropology
[(MACTIA)](http://mactia.berkeley.edu/) in 2224 Piedmont.

  
  
**Requirements:** This course is essentially a practical research/service-
learning course. Participation in the Roosevelt School after-school program
(approx. 2-3 hrs one afternoon each week) is a required part of the course.
Each student will be part of the course term project to evaluate the
introduction of multimedia authoring and the archaeological experience to 6th-
graders through this after-school program. You will be expected to keep a
running log/diary of your observations. Instructions in making these
observations and making evaluations will be given during the course. A small
stipend to cover the cost of travel to the Roosevelt School will be provided.

**ANTHRO 128-3: SPECIAL TOPICS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: "ARCHAEOLOGIES OF SEXUALITY"**

R. Schmidt 4 units, TuTh: 2-3:30, 88 Dwinelle

**  
  
This course will explore the emerging field of sexuality studies within
anthropological archaeology. The course will be organized around a series of
questions, including but not limited to the following: What is sexuality, both
as a set of practices or behaviors, and as a category of discourse? How does
sexuality relate to gender and other social categories of analysis? How does
the constitution of sexuality vary within contemporary societies? How has the
constitution of sexuality varied throughout history and prehistory? What can
studies of sexuality in pre-modern contexts tell us about the constitution of
sexuality in the present and future?  
  
In order to establish a vocabulary with which to discuss these questions,
problems and issues in contemporary sexuality studies will be introduced. From
these topics, the course will move on to consider how sexuality has been
treated as an object of knowledge within disciplines related to archaeology,
including classics and history. Because sexuality studies within archaeology
have derived from the burgeoning field of gender studies in archaeology,
examination of this body of work will provide important context for the
central focus of the course. This central focus will consist of a broad range
of recent case-studies examining sexuality in a wide variety of archaeological
contexts. The particular problems and virtues of using archaeological evidence
to address the study of sexuality will be considered and contrasted with the
virtues and constraints of textual evidence. The course will conclude by
having students evaluate the plausibility, utility and desirability of viewing
sexuality as a culturally contingent and variable set of phenomena throughout
human history.

S. Millerstrom 4 units, TTh: 3:30-5, 247 Cory **(Change of room effective
9/13/01.)**

  
  
Is body decoration such as tattooing, scarification, and hairstyles related to
art? What is art? How and when did art originate? Why are social scientists
and the general public so fascinated with visual images and material objects
from the distant past? What role did art play in the lives of humans without
writing systems in prehistoric small-scale societies? Was art part of rituals
and ceremonies or was it made and used within the private domain?  
  
In this course we will examine a variety of fascinating topics ranging from
rock art to decorated pottery, body decoration, figurines, and sculptures from
Europe, Africa, Oceania, Australia, and North America. We will begin the
course by examining how our interpretation of the Paleolithic art of Europe
has changed over time and then examine current theoretical perspectives and
how archaeologists go about dating these cultural remains. With this
background we will investigate selected visual images and objects of art and
their cultural context in other parts of the world. Lastly, we will look at
how prehistoric art is perceived and related to cultural identity today.

This course is designed to introduce students to the method and theory of
zooarchaeology. Zooarchaeology is the study of animal remains to help answer
questions about past social practices, and is a standard component of
archaeological analyses. This course will address various topics within the
subfield, such as creating reference collections, vertebrate anatomy, the
identification of bone elements, methods of quantification, and historical
perspectives of the uses of faunal analysis in archaeological interpretations.
Students will explore these issues through readings, lectures, discussions,
and laboratory analyses. Course requirements will include in-class
presentations, specimen preparation, and a report based on the analysis of
specimens from existing UCB archaeological collections.  
  
**Prerequisites:** Anthropology 2 or equivalent or permission of instructor.  
  
  
**ANTHRO 138A: ETHNOGRAPHIC FILM HISTORY**

I. Leimbacher 4 units, TuTh: 11-12:30, 160 Dwinelle (note change of schedule)

  
  
The course will trace the development of ethnographic film from its beginnings
at the turn of the century to the present. In addition to looking at seminal
works in the field, more recent and innovative productions will be viewed and
analysed. Topics of interest include the role of visual media in ethnography,
ethics in film making, and the problematic relationship between seeing and
believing. Requirements include film critiques, a film proposal, and a final
exam. _Note: Students who plan to take Anthro 138B for their method
requirement in Spring 2002, must complete 138A._

**ANTHRO C147B: SEXUALITY, CULTURE AND COLONIALISM**

[ L. Cohen](cohen.html) 4 units, MW: 8-10, 3106 Etcheverry (note change of
schedule)

  
  
This course looks at how sexuality and gendered self-expression intersect with
the material structures of political economy and biology and the ideological
structures of cultures.  
  
Most Americans and increasingly much of the rest of the world divide people in
sexual terms into straight, lesbian and gay, and sometimes bi. The literary
critic Eve Sedgwick, one of the earliest leaders of the intellectual movement
sometimes known as Queer Theory, called this divide the
"homosexual/heterosexual binarism." Thought many of us experience this divide
as logical and obvious, in many societies and in the past it has not been as
salient a mode of social organization or personal identification as it is in
the modern West and is becoming elsewhere. Simply put, in much of the world
and in much of history, the division of gay and straight makes little if any
sense.  
  
The anthropologist Gayle Rubin once called the way a society places people
into sexual roles and categories its "sex/gender system." Sedgwick's
"homosexual/heterosexual binarism" could be considered a dominant feature of
our contemporary American sex/gender system. Many anthropologists and
historians have explored the diversity of such systems across society and
history, with mixed results. On the one hand, exploring this diversity allows
us to explore critically how modern Western models of the binarism have become
the unquestioned template for current biological modeling in the search for
the "gay gene" and "gay brain." If we discover that to be straight or gay as
we understand these categories is not a universal of human experience, what
are the implications for gay gene arguments? Must we abandon biological
inquiry, or are there other ways of linking critical social and biological
research?  
  
On the other hand, the concept of sex/gender systems has problems. The notion
that gender and sexuality are organized as a unified cultural system has
proved increasingly inadequate either as a way to understand any given society
or to compare ideas and practices between societies. Anthropological
descriptions of variable sex/gender systems have come under increasing fire
from several quarters.  
  
One particularly important area of critique has emerged out of postcolonial
theory. Describing the sexual particularities of colonized and subject
populations and communities has been utilized historically as a mode of
dehumanizing them and justifying their domination. Sir Richard Burton, the
famous Victorian explorer and rake, went as far to describe the topics as one
big steamy, seamy "Sotadic Zone," a zone where "The Vice" of homosexuality was
ubiquitous. In other words, the natives were all inverts, to use the language
of the time. Given this legacy, does an anthropology which obsesses over
people's sex lives merely revisit this unhappy colonial terrain? What about
human rights abuses, and AIDS prevention? Don't these justify a new global
sexual science, or are they excuses for new voyeuristic practices? A second
area of critique emerges out of ethnic studies and its reconceptualization of
what Gloria Anzaldue called the Borderlands-la Frontera. What does a focus on
systemic difference do to people and communities who fall between the cracks--
economic, national, sexual? Another derives from psychoanalytic and
philosophical theories of what it means to desire, theories that closely
examine the relationship of our desire and the object of our desire to
language.  
  
Within anthropology, research has increasingly moved from efforts to
understand sex and gender in terms of a narrow set of questions--around
kinship and marriage, the normal and abnormal, and in terms people use to
define sexual behavior--to broader efforts engaging all aspects of social and
economic life. This course introduces students to this wealth of scholarship
and debate. It alternates week by week between reading ethnographies and
reading general theoretical debate.

of the students enrolled are not anthropology majors. The course is intended
to provide an introduction to the discipline of folklore, e.g., myth,
folktale, proverb, riddle, gesture, game, etc. Similar courses at other
universities are often offered by faculty members in the English departments.
The emphasis here includes the humanistic, literary approach, but also
emphasizes the relevance of folklore materials for social scientists.

  
  
**Requirements:** Three hours of lecture per week. There is one midterm, a
final, and a course project which consists of making a collection of folklore
on the basis of fieldwork interviews conducted locally. There is considerable
reading required in the course. Readings TBA.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 162: SPECIAL TOPICS IN FOLKLORE: TBA**

F. Vaz da Silva 4 units, MWF: 9-10, 88 Dwinelle

  
  
This course will first provide an overview of the main theories regarding
European fairy tales, and then focus on a hands-on approach to the task of
analyzing and interpreting tales. A constant back-and-forth movement between
the study of theoretical models and the actual analysis of fairy tales will
aim as much at illuminating the latter as at testing the validity and
limitations of the former. Students will be required to participate in class
discussions and complete an original essay on the issue of meanings in fairy
tales.  
  
**Required texts:**  
Holbek, Bengt. 1998. _Interpretation of Fairy Tales: Danish Folklore in a
European Perspective._ Helsinki: Academia Scientiarum Fennica.  
Propp, Vladimir. 1996. _Morphology of the Folktale._ Trans. L. Scott. Austin:

A course reader will be prepared.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 166: LANGUAGE, CULTURE AND SOCIETY**

[A. Yurchak](yurchak.html) 4 units, TuTh: 11-12:30, 22 Warren **(Note room
change. Change will take effect on 9/11/01)**

  
  
This course will discuss the social and cultural aspects of linguistic
communication. The readings will cover the fields of sociolinguistics,
linguistic anthropology, and discourse analysis. We will discuss how different
uses of language in society facilitate communication and cause
misunderstanding, promote similarity and increase difference, establish
domination and express resistance, maintain stability and introduce change. We
will also learn how to do linguistic research in society. The course is
divided into three parts: 1. Basic Concepts, 2. Language and Social
Organization, and 3. Language, Media, and Popular Culture. The readings for
each class are assigned either from the three books that are available for
purchase and are put on reserve at Anthropology Library or from the articles
put on reserve. We will see several films and have several guest speakers
elaborating on the topics discussed.  
  
**Requirements:** Each student will conduct one research project in the course
of the semester studying some aspect of language use in a speech community
(e.g., among university students, rock musicians, fraternity members or in
American or foreign media) on a topic discussed in class. The results of the
projects will be summarized in the final paper (5-8 pages long) due at the end
of the course. There will also be two tests on the course material. The first
mid-term test on will cover the introductory part of the course. The final
test for the entire course will take place at the end of the semester.  
  
  
**ANTHRO 169B: RESEARCH THEORY/METHODS IN SOCIAL/CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY**

[J. Ogbu](ogbu.html) 5 units, MW: 10-12, 155 Kroeber

  
  
This is a 5-unit course which satisfies the method requirement for majors in
social-cultural anthropology. The course is designed to accomplish two things:
(a) examine theories of research methods in social/cultural anthropology, past
and present; and (b) practice these methods through supervised field research
projects. The first part will be done through lectures, assigned readings,
class discussions, and individual consultation. The second part requires each
student to carry out an approved and supervised field research project during
the semester.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 172AC: TOPICS IN AMERICAN CULTURES: "PERSPECTIVES ON IDENTITY"**

[J. Ogbu](ogbu.html) 4 units, W: 2-5, 115 Kroeber

  
  
The concept of identity and approaches to identity as individual (personal),
social and cultural phenomenon will be examined from an interdisciplinary
perspective. The class will analyze theoretical and empirical works in
anthropology, psychology and sociology, etc. Examples will be drawn from
research among groups in the United States and elsewhere.

  
  
  
**ANTHRO 174AC: CALIFORNIA HISTORICAL ANTHROPOLOGY**

[K. Lightfoot](lightfoot.html) 4 units, WF: 10-12, 105 North Gate

  
  
This course presents a detailed examination of the complex entanglements that
took place between Native peoples and European explorers and colonists in
California (from about 1542 to 1850). The course is divided into five main
parts. The first part presents an introduction to coastal Native Californian
cultures at the time of initial European contact, and considers the
implications of these early encounters on native health and cultural
practices. The second part outlines the characteristics of the mission,
presidio, pueblo and rancho communities that typified Spanish-Mexican
California, and how these different colonial enterprises depended on local
native peoples for their survival. The third part will take account of the
Russian frontier society at Fort Ross and how this mercantile operation
exploited native peoples as cheap sources of labor. The fourth part will
briefly examine American expansion into California with particular emphasis on
the Gold Rush. The final part will consider how the colonial past affects
ethnic relations and cultural identity among California Indians in the present
day. The course will involve the examination of a diverse range of primary
sources, including native oral traditions, ethnohistorical documents, and
ethnographic reports. However, a primary goal of the course is to consider how
archaeological research can provide new insights into California¨ªs colonial
past.  
  
This course satisfies the American Cultures requirement; it can count as
upper-division archaeology for the major, and meets the area requirement for
the major.  
  
**Requirements:** Two mid-term exams and the final exam. No term papers.  
  
**Required texts:** A course reader will be required.

ANTHRO 181: THE MIDDLE EAST AND ISLAM **

S. Arebi 4 units, MW: 12-2, 106 Moffitt

  
  
(Professor Saddeka Arebi, is invited back to, again, excite and provoke her UC
Berkeley students to think outside the box!)

  
  
Although, by necessity, we will limit our ethnographic focus to a number of
themes, the broad aim of this course is to examine the contemporary realities
and highlight the extensive diversity of the human experiences in the Arab
World and the Islamic "Middle East". In puruing our goal of fostering a
different way of thinking about the area and its people--a people that has
long been maligned, defamed, and utterly dehumanized--we attempt to respond,
albeit at times more implicitly than explicitly, to two questions: What can an
anthropology of these societies, that takes its cues from the insights of its
indigenous voices, contribute to our understanding of the forces that shape
their contemporary realities? And, most importantly, what are the conditions
for a valid and reliable knowledge of the area? We may repond to the first
question, a substantive one, by way of problematizing the second which is
methodological in nature--not only do we question the field of study, but more
importantly we probe the stance(s) from which it is studied.  
  
This course will steer away from the "Orientalist" revries and anthropological
mirages, and/or whatever other stance that tend to overlook the diversity,
agency, and the creativity of a people who have long and established tradition
of intellectualizing their existence. Instead, we will highlight this
fundamental feature of the Arab/Islamic societies and capture a glimpse of men
and women debating, interpreting and reinterpreting their cultural rules,
history, religion and tradition, constantly re-difining their place in time
and space. We will roam the area, and explore a number of themes that people
themselves identify as forces at work in their societies: The self and the
other, politics of religiousity and authenticity, women and cultural critique,
family and children, poverty, the alien state, and statelessness. etc.

**ANTHRO 188: TOPICS IN AREA STUDIES: "ETHNOGRAPHY OF THE MAYA"**

[W. Hanks](hanks.html) 4 units, Tu: 4-7, 251 Dwinelle

  
  
This course introduces students to the anthropological study of Maya people in
Southern Mexico, Guatemala and Belice. Necessarily selective, the course
focuses on certain parts of the Maya region, emphasizing selected themes and
problems. In the first half of the semester we will explore regional history
in the double sense of the development of Maya studies, and the historical
transformations of Maya societies. These two themes will be traced through
studies of the Classic Maya, the Spanish conquest and colonization, indigenous
resistance and rebellion and recent pan Maya activism. The Yucatan is one of
the best studied parts of the Maya region, and will provide a case study
through which to critically explore the models, methods and practices of
ethnography. In the latter half of the semester, we will examine in detail
aspects of contemporary Yucatecan ethnography, based on research over the past
two decades by myself and others. In this phase, our focus will be the
constitution of lived space and the role of shamanic practice in relation to
the body, the domestic sphere and agricultural production.  
  
**Requirements:** The course will be a combination of lectures and discussion,
with a midterm in week 8 and a final paper (max 25 pp.) to be turned in during
exam week. Class attendance and careful readings are obligatory and will count
towards the grade. There are no prerequisites. Reading knowledge of Spanish
helpful but not required.

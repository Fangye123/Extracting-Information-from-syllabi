Description:_**

**The purpose of ENG. 173-G,** _ _Introduction to Literature__ **,** is to
expose students to the many genres, the many authors and the many perspectives
of truth that can be found under the umbrella of the study of literature found
in the wide world of books. Furthermore students will begin the acquisition of
vocabulary used in analyzing and evaluating works of literary art.  Finally
students will be encouraged to examine their new perspectives while analyzing
a variety of "great ideas," but they will always do this within the framework
of revealed truth in the greatest book, God's Word, the Bible.

Procedure:_**

**ENG 173-G Introduction to Literature:  ** This class will meet three times a
week to discuss the nature of literature using the below reading list as raw
material as well as a series of handouts to be dispersed during the semester.
Discussions will center on some of the common themes that have haunted the
human mind and heart throughout western history.

The following reading list of works is not exclusive and, in fact, many
important works (probably including some of your favorites) have been
excluded. This class can only function as an **introduction** **,** not as an
exhaustive study.   I encourage you to think of the texts for this class not
as a single resource for this one class but a series of inexhaustible treasure
chests, capable of giving refreshment and inspiration time and time again.

Students will be evaluated by a series of four tests, three journal
collections, a midterm and a final.  Also the option for extra credit will be
made available for those who are willing to do extra work.

* * *

![](http://www.mvnc.edu:443/nzr/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/introlit/redball.gif)**_The
purpose of this course is. . ._**



**1**. to expose the student to a wide range of literary genres: poetry,
drama, novel and short story.

**2**. to introduce the student to a wide ranger of authors of different
cultures, genders and ages..

**3**. to encourage the student to consider what makes a work of literature
worthy--how should the cannon be formed?

**4.** to introduce some of the important common issues which authors--in
spite of their different backgrounds, cultures, and mediums--often examine.

![](http://www.mvnc.edu:443/nzr/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/introlit/redball.gif)**The
Actual Reading Texts:**

![](http://www.mvnc.edu:443/nzr/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/introlit/note.gif)**A
Note on the texts:**   Although the number of texts for this class may seem
extensive (and therefore costly), the student should be aware that the college
anthologies often used for such introduction classes as this are massive to
the point of being unwieldy, include so much text that usually huge amounts
are never covered by the instructor, and often are even more expensive than
the collection assigned for this class (think of the cost of your Biology
text).  Thus, by using the Dover editions (a dollar each) and some other
paperbacks I reduce cost and allow myself more specific and efficient control
over the texts I require for our class.

Furthermore, the central purpose of this class is to ** _enrich your life_**.
This is not a vocational training session in which the question of what
information is actually applicable to one's present or future job is central
to the class's worth.  In point of fact most companies have programs to deal
with that need.  The purpose of this course is to broaden the student's
understanding of the human condition, to widen his or her understanding of how
people think, and develop the individual's own sense of what is worthwhile and
beautiful.

Another side benefit is that by having a series of clearly titled texts rather
than some unwieldy ugly anthology, the student will look upon these books less
as a never to be reopened book which is to be filed away, and more as the
beginning of a library filled with books which can be returned to again and
again for their bounty--a treasure trove of future reading.

**_Handouts_**

These will be given throughout the class. Unless specified by Prof. Rearick,
such handouts should be considered required reading like any of the assigned
texts.

**_On line Readings_**

As the links on the above list suggest each author and work covered in class
has a representative page in the web site Dr. Rearick's Reading Corner.  Often
this material will be overtly pointed to in class, but the student who is
striving to excel should make a point of looking at and referring to such
pages in his or her journal.

![](http://www.mvnc.edu:443/nzr/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/introlit/redball.gif)**_Attendance:_**
Since we are functioning on an intensive schedule, it is vital that you be in
class throughout the semester--even on days when a play is being shown in
class.  Three absences will be allowed and then five points will be taken from
the student's final score at the end of the term.  Students who are involved
in a recognized activity for the school (Mandate weekends, traveling musical
groups, athletes) need to see the instructor ahead of time so arrangements can
be made.

Participation: _**Lecture will only play a part in the class activities.
Literature is meant to be talked about.  Students are encouraged to express
their opinions and share their unique insights.  Each of us brings something
special to a text that is ours alone.  Your comments are very important.  I
have been known to add extra credit to students who show an exceptional
willingness to participate in class discussion.

* * *

![](http://www.mvnc.edu:443/nzr/faculty/trearick/english/rearick/introlit/redball.gif)**_Journal:_**

#  Your journal is IMPORTANT!  You should write in it three times a week.  It
is your personal repository for what you think about the works you are reading
and about the material being covered in class.

**I will be looking for the following in your journal:**

**1.**   Three entries per week (totaling 38 by the end of the semester).
Going  beyond that 38 entries **_could_** indicate to the instructor the kind
of student   who will achieve a high grade.  Please note that writing in your
journal is not connected with days on the calendar.&nbs

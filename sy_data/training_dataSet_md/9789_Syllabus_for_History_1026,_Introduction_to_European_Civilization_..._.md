####  Course Description:

This course surveys the history and culture of Europe between A.D. 300 and
1500.  It is divided into four basic parts.  The first part considers the
contributions of Roman civilization, Christianity, and the Germanic tribes to
the culture and institutions of medieval Europe, with a glance at the other
two civilizations that influenced European civilization:  Byzantium and Islam.
The second part will focus on European social institutions:  feudalism,
manorialism, and urban life.  The third part looks at how European
institutions became centralized, and how this resulted in political violence.
The final part will center on the gradual disintegration of medieval
civilization.  As we follow the narrative of events and the political and
economic changes of the period, we will emphasize the experiences of people at
all social levels, how such events shaped their lives or how they carried on,
oblivious of these events.

####  Course Goals:

The course has several goals.  It is designed to acquaint students with
historical and cultural information on medieval Europe.  It is also meant to
show students how historians work.  Finally, the course is intended to teach
students skills in reading critically--that is, to extract the most important
information from a document with a minimum of effort; thinking analytically--
that is, to evaluate the information you find and make an informed judgement
about it; and writing clearly--that is, to communicate your ideas effectively
to others.  Readings, lectures, class discussions, and written assignments are
all designed to help students acquire this knowledge and these skills; it is
therefore essential that you take responsibility for preparing for class by
doing the assigned readings and written work.  Part of each class period will
include discussion and/or small group work.  If you are uncomfortable speaking
in class and feel that I will be unable to evaluate your knowledge of the
course material for that reason, please come to see me.

####  Hints and Pointers on Course Preparation:

**Readings:**   Do all the assigned readings BEFORE the class meeting.  This
will ensure that you get the most from lectures and discussions.  Do not let
yourself be overwhelmed by unfamiliar names and dates!  Look at the broad
picture and pick out the most significant trends, events, and individuals.  
**Class Discussion:**   Participate!  Articulating aloud the facts and trends
that you have read about or heard about in lecture will fix them in your mind.  
**Exams:**   This course will have a midterm and a final exam, each of which
will be one hour long.  You will be given outlines of the lectures that you
can use as study guides.  These will indicate important people, places, dates,
and trends.  When you write the exams, think of each answer as an essay into
which you should put the same kind of thought and organization as you give to
an out-of-class composition.  
**Papers:  ** Start to think about the paper topics and read at least a little
bit of the material well in advance of the due date to get your mind started.
Then the problem will be simmering in the back of your mind even while you're
doing something else and will be clearer when you return to it.  Take time to
outline your thoughts before starting to write.  Leave time to put the paper
aside for at least a day, then come back to it with a critical view for
revision.

NOTE:  Content is the most important component of a paper grade, but errors in
spelling, grammar, and punctuation will result in a lower grade, since such
errors make it difficult for the reader to understand what the writer is
trying to convey.  All papers must be typed, double spaced, and have 1-inch
margins and page numbers.  I prefer that they be printed in either Times Roman
or Courier font; in any case, they must be printed in a 10 to 12 point font.
I will provide a handout showing how I would like the papers to be formatted.

Writing Tutor:  The History Department supports the use of writing in
undergraduate education and employs a graduate student, Wendy Gertjejanssen,
to help students with their writing.  Her services are free and highly
recommended.  She welcomes visits from students at all stages of writing and
with all levels of ability, whether they are completely stuck as to how to
begin or just want advice on final polishing.  If I suggest you see her for
help, do not consider this a punishment-- even graduate students and
professors benefit by having someone look over their papers!  You can give
Wendy a call or e-mail her or stop by one of her offices to make an
appointment, or drop by during her office hours.

####  Policies:

**Office Hours:**   Office hours are a time for you to see me to discuss any
course-related questions or concerns; if you are having difficulties with
anything in the class or have suggestions on how to make the course more
interesting or useful to you, please let me know, since I cannot try to help
you unless I know there is a problem.  You do not need an appointment, but can
just drop by.  If you are unable to see me during office hours I will be happy
to set up an individual appointment at a mutually convenient time.

**Attendance:  ** Regular, prompt attendance is mandatory.  Arriving late or
leaving early is disturbing both to me and to your fellow classmates.  Missing
a class meeting altogether is also a bad idea, since we have only 10 classes
in the quarter.  Although I have set out a schedule for exams and paper due
dates, specific information on assignments will be provided during class
meetings.  If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to contact me
to find out about any handouts, information given, or possible changes in due
dates.  If by missing class you fail to turn in an assignment as scheduled,
your grade on that assignment will drop (see the grading policy) unless you
have contacted me BEFORE the class and we have agreed on other arrangements.

**Grading:**   The overall breakdown of the grade will be the following:

  * 10%  Class Participation
  * 10%  Essay on Power's "Bodo"
  * 20%  Midterm Exam
  * 20%  Final Exam
  * 40%  Research Paper

Work of "A" quality demonstrates that you have done all the assigned readings,
attended lectures, and participated in class discussions.  You know and
understand the material covered by the course and can use it appropriately to
support your own particular, clearly-written argument or interpretation.  You
must also be able to follow instructions and do the assignment asked of you,
not another one with which you are more comfortable.  "B" work differs from
"A" work in that it might not always use the material to support an
independent argument or interpretation; or may not present its argument as
clearly in writing; or may not exactly address the assignment.  "C" work shows
that you know the material covered in the course, but does not use the
material to sustain a clear argument or interpretation, either through lack of
evidence, factual inaccuracies or misunderstandings, problems in writing
clearly, or not answering the assignment.  "D" work shows only that you have a
minimal knowledge of the course material.  An "F" on any assignment shows that
you do not understand the course material; if you receive an "F" you MUST make
an appointment to see me.

**Research Paper:**   The research paper grade has 4 components:  the initial
topic, the primary source analysis, the rough draft, and the final draft.  You
must turn in ALL of these in order to receive a grade on the paper. If you
omit turning in any one component, you will earn an F on the research paper.
More detailed explanations and instructions will be available on a separate
handout.

**Extensions, Makeups, and Incompletes:**   If you think in advance that you
will have difficulty completing an assignment on time, speak to me BEFORE the
assignment is due, and we may be  able to make other arrangements.  Without
prior arrangement with me, any assignment that is turned in late will lose 1/2
grade for each day that it is late.  Assignments are due at the BEGINNING of
the class period (6:00 p.m.); an assignment turned in at the end will be
treated as one day late.  For example, a paper that would have earned a B+,
but was turned in at 8 p.m. on Wednesday after it was due, would receive a C+.  
If you must miss the midterm or final exam for a legitimate, documented
reason, I will schedule a makeup exam for you.  Incompletes will not be
granted without extreme extenuating circumstances (e.g., not because you want
to go to Hawaii for your Christmas vacation early), and they must be arranged
BEFORE December 8, when the final draft of the research paper is due.

**Equality and Disability:**   See the attached university policy statement.

**Sexual Harassment:**   See the attached university policy statement.

**Academic Misconduct:**   See the attached university policy statement.

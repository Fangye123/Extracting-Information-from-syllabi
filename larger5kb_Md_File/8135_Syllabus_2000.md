SYLLABUS



This course explores the history of the book in the West from the invention of
the alphabet to the advent of the electronic book. Topics considered include
authorship, publication, manufacture, distribution, reception, and the
survival of books. Using the facilities of the Spencer Library's Hole & Corner
Press, students will learn the art of printing on a nineteenth-century
handpress.

The required readings for each week should be read prior to that week's class;
lectures and discussion will assume familiarity with them. Reading quizzes may
be given. Grading: Research Paper, 30% (or Manuscript Project 15%, Printed
Book Project 15%); Exhibition 10%; Mid-Term Exam 25%; Final Exam 25%; Printing
Project 10%. Graduate students are required to do the research paper and the
three projects.

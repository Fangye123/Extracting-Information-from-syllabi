**Course Description:**

This course examines the interplay between religion and politics in recent
American history. Despite (or perhaps, because of) the fact that etiquette
books historically advised against discussing either of these topics in social
settings, there is a growing, exciting historical literature that focuses on
the topic as a way of understanding the larger social context and the forces
transforming American life. In particular, the course focuses on the analyses
of AProtestantism@ as the national religion of the United States.

In addition to addressing the specific topic, the course will emphasize
questions of what history is, why we write history, and who historians are.
After examining the theme of religion and politics in four pivotal moments in
American history, students will develop, research, and write their own
project. In addition, as part of being historians, students will exchange work
with classmates as part of a peer-review process.

Although there will be some lecture to provide background, classes will
primarily be discussion. You should come prepared to talk about the issues
raised by the readings, your research, you and your colleagues= projects, and
lectures.



**

Course Objectives:

**

The sustained research project produced by each student will demonstrate his
or her ability:

> > to select an historical topic, identify its significance, and make a plan
of research for that topic;

>>

>> to identify and locate primary (first-hand) sources concerning the topic
you have chosen;

>>

>> to identify significant secondary literature regarding that topic, and
trace the historiography of that topic;

>>

>> to present a thesis, based on research in both secondary and primary
literature and sources;

>>

>> to defend that thesis and make a clear and cogent argument in its defense.

>>

>> **

**

In addition, the peer paper critique, will demonstrate the student=s ability

> > to constructively assist a colleague in improving their work

>>> Completion of reading by the assigned date, attendance at class meetings,
oral presentation of one=s work, and participation in class discussions. By
definition a seminar requires a give and take that can happen only when people
are there and participate. Please note that participation means not just
speaking. It means being prepared and contributing thoughtful ideas or
opinions.

assistance yourself). It is due the night of their presentation.

sources. This paper is the culmination of your course work, prospectus, and
peer critique. It is your chance to write an original academic paper. Details
for proceeding will be provided in class and during one-on-one meetings. The
paper should be submitted in a completed (not Arough@) draft form, critiqued,

Grading policies:

**

While the majority of your grade will be based on your written work, active,
constructive class participation is essential to a successful class.
Attendance will be taken and unexcused absences will affect the participation
grade accordingly.

Developing your intellectual skills is possible only when you actually do the
work assigned. We will have a longer discussion of intellectual work,
intellectual dishonesty, and plagiarism. Plagiarism and cheating will result
in an AF@ for the work in question and possible disciplinary action by the
University. See the _Indiana University Academic Handbook_ (p. 123) or the
_IUPUI Campus Bulletin, 2000-2002_ (p. 36) __ or talk with me if you have
questions about what is or is not permissible.

A grade of Aincomplete@ is troublesome for everyone. The University=s policy
is that they are only for students who have completed almost all course
requirements and have been prevented by significant or unanticipated
circumstances from finishing them.

**

Logistics:

**

As you may know, you are entitled to an e-mail account through IUPUI. I
realize that many of you prefer to use another provider for e-mail and web
work. The University encourages you to set up your IUPUI account to forward
information to your other accounts. It means that you can easily access
information from the University. It also assists me if I need to send out a
general class announcement, although these will normally be on ONCOURSE. If
you need help setting up the account or forwarding mail, contact:

<http://iupui-accts.iupui.edu/students/student.html>

FYI: There is a University web page that will let you know if the campus is
closed for snow:

<http://www.iupui.edu/it/registrar/adverseweather.html>



**

THREE IMPORTANT POINTS:

**

The syllabus for this course will be on ONCOURSE. I will post additions,
corrections, handouts, and other supplemental materials there as well announce
them in class. It is the responsibility of the student to stay on top of
changes.

I cannot stress too heavily the usefulness of planning ahead, saving work on
your computer OFTEN, making backups, and printing out your paper early.

Books, handouts, and other reading material should be brought to class the
day/s they are being discussed.

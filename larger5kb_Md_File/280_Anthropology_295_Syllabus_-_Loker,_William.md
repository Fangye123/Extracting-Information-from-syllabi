**Course summary:** This course examines the applications of anthropology to
the solution of contemporary social problems. While all subfields of
anthropology have applications, this course focuses on the applications of
cultural anthropology. The course provides a history of applied anthropology
in America, a conceptual framework for understanding different "styles'9 of
applied anthropology and detailed consideration of many of the domains of
applied cultural anthropology such as: medical anthropology, anthropology and
international development, anthropology of business and industry, anthropology
in education, anthropology and law/criminal justice, anthropology and
environmental issues and others. We will also examine the methods of applied
anthropology, the relationship between applied research and theory, and
ethical issues in the practice of anthropology.  

The course consists of lectures, readings from a textbook, and articles
illustrating the latest trends in the field. We will rely heavily on the case
study approach in which students read and analyze actual cases of
anthropologists working in applied settings in order to gain a realistic feel
for the varied settings of applied practice. The course also includes a
project in which students design, and write a grant for, an applied
anthropology project in an area relevant to the field.

**Organization**  

**Part One** will provide an overview of the field and discuss the
relationship of applied anthropology to other dimensions of the discipline and
the history of applied cultural anthropology. We will discuss the social
context in which applied anthropology is carried out and how this influences
professional practice including a discussion of ethical issues.  

> Readings: van Willigen, Chapters _1-5;_ Spicer, "Reluctant cotton pickers,"
"Resistance to freedom," "Anthropology and the War Relocation Authority."
Additional Readings as assigned in class.  
>

**Part Two** will provide an in depth consideration of different approaches
and specializations within applied anthropology. We will examine the
textbook's discussion of different styles of applied anthropology ("action,"
"advocacy," "brokering," etc.) as well as additional examples of
specialization with the practice of applied anthropology (medical,
educational, business, international development and work in federal, state
and local government agencies, etc.).

> Readings: van Willigen, Chapters 6-13; Baba, "Anthropology in business: an
overview," Jordan, "Consulting in organizational culture," Fetterman,
"Educational evaluation," Murray. "The domestication of wood in Haiti," Green,
"Traditional medicine in Swaziland." Additional readings as assigned in class.

**Part Three** will focus on method and theory in applied anthropology as well
as recent changes in the socio-political context in which applied
anthropologists work that influence the types of skills and concepts that
students must master in the current job market. Much of this last part of the
course will be devoted to analyzing a particular social problem and designing
an appropriate applied anthropology intervention. This exercise will be a
group project and include background research and the drafting of a proposal
to deal with the problem identified. More details will be provided in class.

> Readings: van Willigen, Chapter 14; Finan and van Willigen, "Soundings...,"
Agar, "Don't tell it, show it," Chambers, "The culture of policy." Additional
readings as assigned in class.

**Requirements:** This class is run on a seminar basis. A seminar is basically
an approach to learning in which members of the class jointly explore concepts
and ideas in a set of readings under the guidance of the instructor. Therefore
it is essential that you come to class, and that you come prepared to discuss
the readings. Most of your grade will be based on class participation.

For each case study we read, each student will be required to write a brief
summary and analysis of the case examined. The case study analyses will be 2-3
pages, typed, double spaced. In addition, individual students will be assigned
chapters or articles and be expected to lead the class discussion of those
readings.

Applied anthropology is a particularly difficult topic to teach through "book
learning;" as the author of your text points out, it is an art learned through
practice. We will try to get a feel for the practice of anthropology through
extensive readings of case studies and through our project in applied
anthropology. The project will focus on an actual problem or problems, either
locally, regionally or globally, and design an applied anthropology
intervention. The product of this work will be a proposal that outlines the
problem and proposes an intervention. Again, details of this project will be
worked out in class.

**Required Texts:** John van Willigen (1993) _Applied Anthropology: an_
_introduction_. Westport, CT: Bergin  & Garvey.

In addition, there is a packet of photocopied readings on reserve at the
library and at Mr. Kopy copy center downtown.

* * *

**Grading:** Grading will be based on class attendance and participation,
written analyses of case studies and oral presentations on readings. There
will be 10 case study analyses worth 20 points each. There will also be two
take home exams, worth 100 points each, covering Parts One and Two of the
course. You will also be graded on your contribution to the class project(s).
The class project will be a proposal for an applied anthropology project.
Guidelines for this document will vary, depending on the nature of the
project, and will be worked out in coordination with the instructor over the
course of the semester.

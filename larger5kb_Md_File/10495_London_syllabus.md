This course will cover selected topics concerning economic relations between
the United States and Great Britain and the comparative economic histories of
the two countries. Coverage will span from the colonial era to the present.
Topics will include: economic aspects of the American Revolution; the
political economy of slavery in the American Republic and the British Empire;
British-American trade relations; the economics of empire-building; the World
Wars; the response to the Great Depression; the much-remarked economic
"declines" of both countries; and the conservative revolutions in both
countries in the 1980s.

**Evaluation of student performance**  
  Final exam  | 55%  
---|---  
Midterm exam | 25%  
Course journal and class participation  | 20%*  
  
* Your course journal should be typed and should include notes on and reactions to the readings, as well as your study notes for the exams. Be sure to number your pages and to keep your journal neat and well organized. Class participation is the less important component of this part of your grade -- active and constructive class participation will help your grade, but I recognize that some people are shy, so failing to speak up regularly in class will not hurt your grade. (Failing to _attend_ class, on the other hand, will surely hurt your grade.)

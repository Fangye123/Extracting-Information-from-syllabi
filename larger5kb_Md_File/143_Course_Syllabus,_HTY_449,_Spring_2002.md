**Course Description:**

The course will focus on the history of both the black and white populations
of South Africa from the 1640s until the present.  In the first part of the
course, we will look at the history of South Africa prior to the arrival of
the Portuguese, Dutch and British, and then the changes posed by European
settlement at the Cape.  In the second part of the course, we will look at the
major conflicts of the 19th Century involving the British, Boers, Sotho-Tswana
and Nguni peoples.  We will examine, in particular, the hostility of the Boers
to British rule and the establishment of their own independent republics.  We
will also look at the impact of the Mfecane and the abolition of slavery.  The
third part of the class will examine the development of the Union of South
Africa.  We will discuss the deterioration of the British-Boer relationship
and its result.  We will look at the construction of Afrikaner nationalism and
the changing economy of the four colonies.  The last part of the class will
examine the construction, practice and destruction of Apartheid.  We will
explain the why, what and how it worked.

_Recommended Reading_

L. Thompson               _A History of South Africa_

This text gives a good overview of South Africa since the 17th century.  You
are not required to read it, but you may wish to read all or some of it to
help you better understand the lectures and the course of South African
history.  I _strongly recommend_ that you read it chapter by chapter as we
progress through the semester.   It is _not_ a substitute for missing
lectures.   This text, as well as all the required texts, will be on sale at
the bookstore and will be available at the library reserve. __

_Requirements_

Mid-term exam (20%), Final exam (30%), one 5-8 page paper (20%), oral book
review (10%), class participation (20%).



1) Exams.  There will be a Midterm exam (75 minute) and a Final Examination (2
hours).  Each exam will consist solely of essay questions.  The final exam
will include a cumulative essay question.  All make-up exams will be given on
the last day of this class.



2) Paper.  You will read two or more scholarly books and/or articles on a
topic concerning South Africa and do a comparative analysis of the authors'
theses.  (These can not come from the required reading list.)  This is NOT a
research paper.  The goal of the paper is to demonstrate that history is not a
science; research and analysis can reflect the historian's viewpoint.  You
will pick one topic and compare differing viewpoints on that topic.  A good
paper will have a clear thesis in the introduction which tells the reader the
subject of the paper and the sources that are being used.  This will be
followed by a few pages of historical background which will allow the reader
to better understand the subject.  Next, the arguments of the selected authors
will be analyzed.  And finally, the arguments will be compared and contrasted.
You are welcome and encouraged to provide your own opinion in the conclusion.
For footnotes, bibliography etc... please use Turabian's _A Manual for
Writers_ or _The Chicago Manual of Style_.



Each of you MUST meet with me to discuss your paper topic before you begin
your research.  Make sure I approve of your choice of sources.  Internet
sources are not acceptable, unless they are approved e-journals.  Remember,
the resources of the library are limited.  Start your research early.
Articles can be obtained through inter-library loan but they take time.  Paper
topics are due 2/26.  The first draft is due 4/11, (in class).  The first
draft is to be a finished product, complete with bibliography and footnotes.
However, it will not be graded as long as meets the requirements. Bring 5
copies of your paper to class.  Written criticisms and comments are due 4/25
(in class).  Please make 2 copies.  The final draft is due 5/9. **Failure to
do any of the above assignments on time will result in a reduction of your
final paper grade.

3) Participation.  You are expected to attend class and to _participate_.
This includes raising questions in class, coming for help or to discuss the
lectures or assignments during office hours, and, especially, commenting on
the assigned readings on the days set aside for discussion.  (Feel free to
communicate by e-mail too.)  Don't be afraid to speak out!  This will count
for 20% of your grade.







4) Oral Book Review.  Each of you will present an 8-10 minute oral review of
an essay, article, or chapter(s) from one of the following texts available at
the library reserve desk.  (Subjects will be selected/assigned the second week
of class.)  Do not simply read from article.  The Library has been known to
lose things.  Give yourself plenty of time to find what you need.  See me if
you need any help.

>  
>  Evaluation Procedures:  
>  
>  1\. Preparation of a "retold" story (25% of grade):

>

>   Each student will choose a story that has been previously published and
will prepare to tell it to the class.  The story should be retold in the
students own style.  Some phrases, lines and sentences may remain the same as
in the original story, but for the most part the story should be paraphrased
so that the storyteller can remain spontaneous during the telling.  This story
should be about 3 - 5 minutes long and will be presented to the class during
the 4th class session.

>

>  2\. Preparation of an original story (25% of grade);

>

>   Each student will prepare a story that is original to the student.  This
can be a family history story, a personal experience story, a story with local
flavor, a thematic story to provide a moral, or anything that fires the
student's imagination.  It can be real or imagined, fact or fantasy, and can
be prepared for an audience of adults or children.  This story should be about
3 - 5 minutes long and will be presented to the class during the 5th class
session.  This last session will be held off campus at a mystery location that
will provide an entirely different atmosphere for performance than a classroom
can offer.

>

>  3\. Analysis of Stories (25% of grade):

>

>   While working with groups throughout this course, students will be
analyzing stories, writing story outlines, making performance notations,
producing lists of stories etc.  This work will be collected into folders and
handed in for evaluation at the end of the week.

>

>  4\. Participation during workshop (25% of grade):

>

>   Participation grade is determined by:  
>    \- prompt attendance at all class meetings  
>    \- preparation of materials and readings  
>    \- the effort made by the student during storytelling sessions  
>    \- contribution to the evaluation of other class members' stories and
presentations  
>    \- involvement in and contribution to class discussions  
>    \- impromptu readings and tellings of stories  
>

>

> * * *

>

>  
> No work is due after the end of the scheduled class time.  In other words,
all course work will be completed during the week of June 25 - 29.  It would,
however, be to a student's advantage to do some reading on storytelling and
also read or listen to a variety of stories before the course begins.

**Course Description**

> Computer-based Information Systems is a programming course which will focus
on creating applications using Visual Basic for Applications \- Excel (VBA).
VBA is a subset of Visual Basic (VB)  and like VB, is an object-oriented
programming language.  During the course, we will use basic application
development principles to build applications by extending and enhancing the
capabilities of an end-user tool -- Excel.  Working knowledge of Excel is
required; prior programming experience is helpful but not necessary.

> Prerequisites: SOM122 or equivalent

**Text   (required)**

>   * Jacobsen, Reed,  _Microsoft Excel 2000 Visual Basic for Applications:
Fundamentals_

>  
>  (available in the Syracuse University Book Store)  
> ISBN: 0-7356-0593-9

**Instructional Methods**

> The course will be taught using a combination of lecture, demonstrations,
problem presentations, study examples, tutorials , homework exercises, and
group problem solving sessions.  An essential component of the instruction
involves the personal, hands-on programming experience you will do outside of
class.  Expect to spend an average of six (6) hours per week outside of class
completing tutorials, homework assignments, and the final project.

* * *

  
**Learning Objectives**

> This course is designed to give students:

>

>   * an introduction to object-oriented programming languages;

>   * a hands-on experience with programming, debugging, and problem solving;

>   * a chance to utilize basic application development principles to design a
computer based application;

>   * a deeper understanding of how data can be captured and effectively
presented to enhance decision making.

>

By the end of the course, students should:

    * have solid skills that will enable further advanced study of software development;
    * understand the capabilities of Excel and how the software can be enhanced using VBA for customized applications;
    * understand how organizations can capture and utilize data for management
    * be able to interact more effectively with software engineers.

* * *

  
**Expectations**

> Students enrolled in the course will have a variety of different abilities.
A few students will be able to complete all work quickly and easily; most will
require considerable effort.   You will be expected to spend whatever time is
necessary given your own experience and abilities.  In addition you will be
expected to:

>

>       * complete all tutorials **before** the class for which they are
assigned; you may receive help from other students for particularly stuborn
bugs

>       * attend and participate in all classes

>       * complete exercise assignments on the day they are due; these
assignments must be done **individually!!**

>       * prepare an **individual** final project

>

During class we will cover when it is and is not permissible to consult other
students .   Any questions about the policy should be addressed to the
professor.  Inappropriate consultation is a violation of the academic
integrity policy (see below) and is a serious matter.

>

> Students are expected to conduct themselves professionally at all times.
This means that you will be expected to:

>

>              1.arrive on time and prepared  
>              2.observe appropriate classroom behavior  
>              3.treat others respectfully.

* * *

  
**Attendance Policy**

> Class attendance is strongly encouraged!  During class we will cover
material that is not presented in the book but which will be required for
skill mastery.

* * *

  
**Course Evaluation**

> Students will be asked to give formal feedback about the course at two
points during the semester.  Mid-course    evaluations will be used to make
adjustments to this course to better meet the needs of current students.  The
final course evaluations will be used to improve future offerings of the
course.  Your input is very valuable, and you are strongly encouraged to
participate in both evaluations.  Additionally, informal feedback is accepted
at any time.

**Academic Integrity Policy**

> **The faculty of the School of Management has adapted an Academic Integrity
Policy emphasizing that honesty, integrity, and respect for others are
fundamental expectations in our School.   The Policy requires all students who
take SOM courses to certify in writing that they have read, understand, and
agree to comply with the Academic Integrity Policy.  SOM students should have
already completed the certification.  All non-SOM students enrolled in this
course are required to complete a certification statement available in the
Undergraduate Office (Suite 210).  Completed statements will be kept on file
in the Undergraduate Office.**

Internet Primary Documents as assigned below.

**Course Requirements**

There will be THREE examinations, worth 100 points each, that collectively
will comprise 65% of the course grade (20+20+25). An additional 25% will be
earned from a term paper. This assignment consists of a research paper of
approximately 10-15 pages on any significant Christian individual, movement or
group that functioned between the fourth and the fifteenth centuries. The
paper will, in addition, contain footnotes and a bibliography constructed in
accordance with the University of Central Arkansas, Department of History
[Style Sheet](http://www.uca.edu/divisions/academic/history/stylesheet.htm). A
minimum of ten sources must be cited, of which at least two have to be
monographs, and two articles in scholarly journals. Ten per cent of the grade
will be based upon quizzes, class participation and oral reports. In addition,
students are requested to obtain a UCA e-mail account.

**Aims and Objectives**

History of Christianity I introduces the student to some of  the important
personages, institutions, ideas, movements and conflicts that are associated
with the development of Christianity as an historical movement within the
Roman Empire and then during the European Middle Ages. Chronologically, the
course spans the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era. The student
will come to understand how religion and society intersect.

**Course Policies**

Class attendance is required; students who accumulate more than four absences
are liable to dismissal from class. Late arrivals and/or early departures
count as a class absence. Cell phones and paging devices must be turned off
during class. Instances of academic dishonesty will bear the penalty of a zero
grade on the assignment or activity in question. The University of Central

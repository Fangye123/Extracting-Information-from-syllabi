COURSE OVERVIEW
Introduction to Computing in the Arts
consists of  lectures and labs designed to immerse the student in
the dynamic field of computing arts. The course seeks to provide the student
with a historical, theoretical, aesthetic, and technical introduction to
the challenges inherent in the collision of art, culture and computing.
Lectures will present and present and examine
the history of computers and artists' and musician's use of them. Lectures
are organized around principle areas of enquiry and are intended to provide
a framework for considering all types of digital and electronic media.
Thoughout the quarter, we will view a broad range of work by artists who
use the computer as a medium, as a tool, as subject matter or all of the
above.
Inside and outside of class you will see
and interact with artwork on CD-ROM, the Web and videos as well as other
cultural artifacts of the digital age, from computer console games to online
chat rooms. During weekly labs, students will be introduced to NT workstations
and will use some of their basic mediatypes and tools to develop art projects.
Also during labs, students will discuss the required readings and present
and critique their art projects.

GRADING POLICY AND GENERAL RULES
All assignments must be turned in on
time at the beginning of section. Failure to complete work on due date
will result in a full letter grade reduction for each subsequent class
in which project is not turned in. Final projects must be turned in on
time to receive credit. No late final projects will be accepted.
There is no make-up time for the final exam.
ATTENDANCE
In the case of an excused absence, student
will provide a written excuse or a doctor's note. Student will be allowed
one unexcused absence for a lecture and one for a lab during the quarter.
After this limit, each unexcused absence will automatically lower your
grade one half a letter grade. At the end of the lectures, students must
sign attendance sheet. Arriving to class late, forgetting to sign attendance
sheet or leaving early will count as an absence on the student's record.
DISCLAIMER
In this class I reserve
the right to show a broad range of course materials, some of which assume
the audience to be adult in age and demeanor. Should you at any time in
the course of the class feel offended by something you have seen or heard,
we would appreciate you staying to be part of a dialogue. If you feel that
you cannot stay, remove yourself from the classroom as discretely as possible.
You may be asked to report on your response.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** In this course we will explore all aspects of the
social uses and symbolic meanings we attach to food and eating. How do we use
food to make friends, to make enemies, and to make ourselves? What is changing
in our food consumption patterns? What are some of the politics and the ethics
involved in producing and marketing food? What is the significance of eating
out? Of  "ethnic" restaurants? Of Starbucks? How do we analyze the smell and
taste of food cross-culturally? These and other questions will be approached
from a variety of anthropological perspectives.

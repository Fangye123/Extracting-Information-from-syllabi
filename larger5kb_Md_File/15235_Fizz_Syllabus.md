* HESC 431 - Physiology of Activity Lab, Sports Science Lab rm. 147 *

**_Laboratory Introduction:_**

Lab experiences in this course are designed to provide students exposure to
various measurements commonly used in the study of exercise physiology.  It
will also provide the student with a first hand opportunity to collect and
analyze data, processes vital to the completion of any scientific research.
Every effort has been made to coordinate laboratory experiences with lecture
information.  It is hoped that the student will realize this and comprehend
the complimentary nature of exercise physiology laboratory and lecture.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS  
![](border.gif)

**_Lab Format:_**

Each laboratory session will involve doing at least one experiment that will
generate related data.  You are responsible for reading the provided lab
handout and being prepared to run the assigned experiment.  You should also be
prepared to record all pertinent information (e.g., data, notes on discussion,
etc.) during class in preparation for writing lab reports.  A typed report is
required for each lab session unless otherwise specified.

A lab write-up should include:  a) results appropriately presented in tabular
or graphic form, and b) discussion of these results, which must be **TYPED**.
Your discussion section will consist of answering several questions listed in
the lab handout.  For the discussion section, type the question first then
your response.  Use lecture/lab notes, the handout itself, your textbook, and
any other qualified reference material to aid in your work.  Often you will
have to use **OUTSIDE REFERENCES** in order to receive total credit for your
answers.   Please be sure to formally cite any reference that you may use
including page number or URL.  **BE SURE TO DO YOUR OWN LAB REPORTS**.   Any
cases of Academic Dishonesty will be handled by the Dean of Students' Office.
Come and see me if you need help.

 The lab write-up should be arranged as follows:  
 Title page  
 Raw Data  
 Purpose & Methods  
 Results  
 Discussion  
 References

Lab reports will be turned in **AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH LAB** the subsequent
week.   They will be assessed based upon completeness, content quality, and
legibility.  Labs are graded on a 20 - 35 point scale depending on length and
difficulty.  Labs must be typed, and double-spaced, and on time.

Late labs will be accepted up until one lab after the assigned due date.
Penalty:  3 points off for the first day late, 2 points off per day
thereafter.  After this time, a zero will be given.

**_Lab Attendance, Preparedness, and Participation:_**

You are required to attend all labs.  There will be no switching into the
other lab class, unless given permission by the instructor.  If you do not
contact me at least 24 hours in advacnce about missing lab, you will be given
a zero for that lab and the quiz.  You should also be prepared to participate
as a subject or experimenter each week.  For some labs, the subject will be
chosen the previous week.

Weekly quizzes will be given at the beginning of each lab to assess a
student's readiness to participate as a subject or tester.  The quizzes will
be no more than 8-10 questions and will cover general information from the lab
handout.

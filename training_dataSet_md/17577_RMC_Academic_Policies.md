**RMC Academic Policies **

## Degrees

Rocky Mountain College offers two baccalaureate degrees, the bachelor of arts
degree and the bachelor of science degree. The associate of arts degree is
offered as well as a certificate in computer applications.

College credit is offered on a semester basis. Courses offered in short terms
and summer sessions meet more frequently and for longer times each meeting.
Enrollment is always for a semester, short term, or a summer session except in
the case of a special workshop.

**Academic Standing**

## Course Hours

A course for one semester hour of credit meets for a 50-minute period once a
week for the semester. For each class session, the student is expected to
spend at least two hours in preparation. In studio, laboratory, or activity
courses, two hours of attendance are required weekly for one semester-hour
credit. In the case of seminars or independent study courses, less class
attendance may be required and a proportionately larger amount of time spent
in preparation. For regularly enrolled students, the usual class load is 15 to
16 semester hours per semester.

## Levels of Courses

It is recommended that students take courses at the level of their class
standing, provided that specific prerequisites have been met. Taking a course
two levels or more above or below the level of class standing is not
permitted, except with the approval of the instructor. All courses are further
classified as either lower division or upper division. The former are courses
numbered 100 to 299; upper division courses are those numbered 300 to 499. A
minimum of 40 semester hours must be completed in upper division courses. At
least twelve of the 40 must be in the student's major field.

Courses cross-listed at a lower-division and upper-division level may only be
taken once for credit unless otherwise noted.

## Cancellation of Courses

The college reserves the right to cancel any course which does not have an
enrollment of at least six at the end of the fifth class of any semester.

## Regular Courses

To facilitate arrangements for instruction, the college faculty and course
offerings are organized into programs. All regular course offerings are listed
in this catalog. Courses cross-listed at a lower-division and upper-division
level may only be taken once for credit unless otherwise noted.

The term courses are scheduled to be offered is noted by Fall semester, Spring
semester, Summer session, alternate years, or on demand. The course schedule
is subject to change. Corrections are available in the office of the
registrar. Courses for which there is small demand are offered alternate years
or on demand. A course designated on demand will be offered when there is
sufficient number of students requesting the course, usually five or more, and
if suitable arrangements can be made. Students should plan their schedule
carefully with their advisor to take required courses when they are offered.

## Special Courses

**Special Topics 180, 280, 380, 480:** Faculty members may arrange, with the
approval of the Academic Vice President, to offer under a special topics
number courses not regularly listed in the catalog.

**Independent Study 299:** Offered to freshmen or sophomores only by
initiation of a faculty member and approval of the Council of Chairs. Its
purpose is to allow work outside of the regularly offered course schedule in
exceptional circumstances. Each independent study is one to three semester
hours.

**Field Practicum 291, 391:** Field practicum may be offered by all programs
for 1 to 3 semester hours with the possibility of being repeated up to a total
of 12 semester hours (athletic training majors may take up to 16 hours). There
is to be a faculty evaluation of the student's performance, with a statement
of the evaluation to be kept with the student's records.

**Internship 450:** An internship experience offers juniors and seniors with
any major a learning experience in a work-place setting. These work
experiences are considered a regular part of the degree program, just as any
of the college's academic offerings. Internships are arranged between a
faculty member and the student with assistance from the career planning and
placement office. Up to 15 semester hours may be earned in internships.

**Directed Reading 399:** Directed reading courses are authorized for each
program, to be offered at the discretion of the instructor and subject to the
approval of the Academic Vice President. Each professor offering directed
reading is responsible for providing a reading list or series of study
questions, or a syllabus to the student, so that the course is indeed directed
reading, not just reading. One to three semester hours.

(Note: Under special circumstances a student may take a regular course by
arrangement with a member of the faculty if the student is legitimately unable
to attend the regular class sessions and has the instructor's approval. In
this case the student should enroll in the course under its regular number,
not under directed reading or any other special course number. The guidelines
for special courses given below, however, must be followed when regular
courses are taken by arrangements.)

**Seminar 490:** Seminar is an interdisciplinary course carrying two to three
semester hours of upper-division credit. Admission is restricted to juniors
and seniors.

**Independent Study 499:** Independent Study is offered by those programs
which offer majors. Its purpose is to allow a superior student to devise and
pursue independent study of an area agreed upon in consultation with the
faculty member who will supervise the study, subject to approval of the
Academic Vice President. In order to qualify for such study, a student must 1)
major or minor in the program, 2) be a junior or a senior, and 3) carry a GPA
of a 3.00 or better. Each independent study is one to three semester hours.

**Continuing Education 900:** These courses are designed primarily for the
post-baccalaureate student, and do not apply toward a bachelors degree.
Elementary and secondary school teachers may use these courses for
professional advancement, recertification, and/or salary increment with school
district approval. Permanent records are kept.

**Guidelines:** The following guidelines are used for all special courses:

Special courses use the following work-load standards for a credit: 45 hours
of student time for each semester hour; or completion of certain prescribed
amounts of work or readings, determined at the beginning of the course.

The faculty member in charge is responsible for evaluating the student through
oral or written tests, through the presentation of a paper or completed
project, or by any other sound means of evaluation.

All special courses are to be taken seriously as academic courses based on
advanced planning. They are to be completed by the end of the semester or term
when they are started, just as regular classes. Incomplete grades will be
given, as the catalog points out, only under unusual circumstances and with
the instructor's consent. See description of grades later in this section.

## Non-traditional Credit

Recognizing that valuable learning often takes place outside the classroom,
the college offers the opportunity to obtain academic credit for non-
traditional learning experiences within certain guidelines. Non-traditional
credits will not be accepted in transfer and may apply to no more than 25
percent of a degree program. Non-traditional credit will be posted on the
transcript after successful completion of one semester of full-time
enrollment. Any student enrolled in a certificate program may challenge up to
three credits. For certificate seeking students, these credits will be posted
upon the successful completion of at least two other credits in the program.
In the case of CLEP, DANTES, AP, IB or Military credit, official score reports
must be submitted for credit to be granted. More details are available from
the office of the registrar.

**Credit for Prior Learning:** Students may earn credit for documented and
currently held learning gained through life experience and its equivalency to
the content of courses in the academic curriculum. To request credit for prior
learning, a student is required to submit an application and prepare a
portfolio to document the learning involved. Students must distinguish between
learning and experience, articulate knowledge and its application, and
establish connections between theory and practice in their field. More
information is available through the career planning and placement office or
the degree completion office.

**Challenge of a Course:** Student may challenge courses not previously taken
if they have a GPA of at least 3.00. The approval of the instructor, the
advisor, and the Academic Vice President must be obtained and the agreement
form filed with the office of the registrar.

**College-Level Examination Program:** Students who wish to earn college
credit may do so by successfully completing one or more of the general
examinations or the subject examination of the College-Level Examination
Program (CLEP). Credit may also be earned through the Defense Activity for
Traditional Educational Support (DANTES) program. Any CLEP or DANTES
examinations for credit must be completed by the end of the second semester of
enrollment at RMC. More information is available through the degree completion
program office.

**Credit for military experience and training:** Credit will be evaluated
based on the American Council of Education recommendations for credit for
military experience. The office of the registrar will evaluate this credit
after the student enrolls.

**Credit for advanced learning in high school:** College credit is awarded for
advanced work in secondary school. Credit is accepted through the Advanced
Placement test of the College Entrance Examination Board, International
Baccalaureate Diplomas, or through tech-prep agreements with local high
schools. Students should consult with the office of the registrar concerning
credits accepted and level of performance required.

## International Learning Experiences

### _Rocky International:_ Study, Intern, Work, or Volunteer Abroad

The Office of International Programs assists students in choosing an
international experience which best enhances their educational and career
goals. Most Rocky International programs cost about the same as a semester at
Rocky. In addition, all federal and Rocky financial aid can be used in these
programs. With good planning, an international experience will not delay your
graduation. All programs will enhance your chances for success after
graduation. Some are appropriate for year-long study, others for a semester,
and others are offered in the summer. Choose the program that best fits your
interests. The Office of International Programs also assists students to find
internships, work, or volunteer opportunities abroad.

Rocky offers occasional courses during a semester through which students study
on campus for the majority of the semester, then travel abroad to culminate
the experience. These courses include the Mission to Merida, Mexico, and the
Music and Art of Austria and Bavaria.

## Occupational Therapy

The program's objective is to prepare the student as a professional capable of
designing and implementing rehabilitation programs to help the physically
challenged in skills necessary for daily life: mobility, personal hygiene, and
body conditioning.

Rocky's pre-occupational therapy course work is designed to complement the 3-2
program at Washington University (St. Louis). Students spend an average of
three years at Rocky satisfying specific prerequisite courses and partially
fulfilling a major. Students must maintain a 3.0 GPA, obtain a faculty
recommendation, and take the GRE to apply for acceptance into the entry level
master's program at Washington University. Those who complete the
prerequisites at RMC are not guaranteed a position in the Washington
University program; they must apply and be accepted. Students need to
recognize that this major requires attendance and successful completion of two
semester of class work at Washington University before a bachelor's degree is
granted by Rocky Mountain College.

Basically, the prerequisites are (in semester hours): English composition, 3;
biology, 3; anatomy and physiology, 6; physics, 3; child development and/or
psychology, 3; abnormal psychology, 3; sociology and anthropology, 3;
political science and economics, 3; basic statistics, 3; electives, 59.

Students must begin to fulfill a major at Rocky. Successful completion of the
first year at Washington University is required for the awarding of a
bachelor's degree from Rocky.

## [Teaching Certification](...catalog.php3?code=EDC)

For information about teaching certification, refer to the education program
section of the catalog.

## Individualized Program of Study (IPS)

The individualized program of study allows students to design a program that
is not regularly offered by Rocky Mountain College. Any student who has not
completed the junior year is eligible to apply for IPS. The student
determines, with the help of faculty advisors, a program of study tailored to
meet individual needs and interests. The IPS may apply to the student's total
program, to the major, or to the minor. All other graduation requirements must
be completed.

All IPS programs must be approved by the student's academic advisor, the
Council of Chairs, and the Academic Vice President. All proposals must be
approved by the end of the student's junior year. Applications should include
the educational rationale behind the program, and a list of all courses to be
applied toward the program. All IPS majors and minors must meet the minimum
criteria listed in the requirements for a baccalaureate degree. Proposals are
evaluated on the basis of whether or not an IPS provides a coherent program of
study, can better meet the needs of the student, and whether or not the
student can offer evidence of ability to plan and carry out such an
individualized program. To be eligible for consideration, the student must be
regularly enrolled at Rocky Mountain College and available for regular on-
campus contact with the major advisor.

Back to top of page.

## Requirements for a Baccalaureate Degree

A minimum of 124 semester hours (certain programs may require more). No more
than 64 semester hours (96 quarter hours) are acceptable in transfer from a
two-year college. Unless being counted toward a major, a maximum of 8 credits
in applied music, 8 credits in ensemble, 8 credits in theatre arts, or 8
credits in physical education activity courses may be counted toward
graduation. Unless being counted toward the major, no more than 12 of these
activity credits can count toward the total credit requirement.

The general education requirements listed below must be met.

  * A candidate must have a cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 (C) for all courses applying to the degree, and a cumulative GPA of 2.00 in all courses taken at Rocky Mountain College.

  * A minimum of 24 semester hours is required in the major field with a GPA of 2.25 (C+). The specific requirements for a particular major are listed under the program concerned. The student must complete at least 3 courses in the major field at Rocky Mountain College.

  * Forty semester hours must be earned in upper division courses. At least 12 of the 40 semester hours must be in the major field. If a minor is chosen, it must include a minimum of six upper division semester hours.

  * A candidate for a baccalaureate degree at Rocky Mountain College must have completed at this college a minimum of 30 semester hours, including at least 20 upper-division hours. Twenty-four of the last 30 hours required for graduation must be earned in residence. This may be modified in exceptional cases upon petition to the Academic Vice President. 

## Requirements for an Associate of Arts Degree

  * A minimum of 62 semester hours of which at least the last 31 have been taken at Rocky Mountain College; and

  * The general education requirements listed below must be met; and

  * A candidate must have a cumulative GPA of 2.00 (C) for all courses applying to the degree.

## Categories of General Education Requirements

In 1994, Rocky Mountain College adopted these general education requirements
to better fit the college's mission statement and goals. In 2001, the college
reviewed its general education requirements and modified them to better define
its goals for graduates, concentrating on student experiences and needs. These
requirements fall into two broad categories: skills and literacy and
distribution.

**Skills and Literacy:** The first section, skills and literacy, is designed
to ensure that all Rocky graduates possess basic skills and also to make clear
that these skills will be addressed throughout the entire curriculum. These
skills require continual attention as an individual pursues a major and a
career.

To illustrate, RMC addresses the skill of writing first with two courses,
First Year Writing and one advanced writing course. In addition, throughout
their upper-level courses and those in the major, students will be required to
do a substantial amount of writing. These courses need not be English courses;
more often they will be courses in the student's major. The college's
expectation is that students will continue to consider the process of writing
and improving their writing skills whether they are first-year students or
graduating seniors.

This same principle applies to the mathematics and the speaking requirements.
First the student will take one speaking and two mathematics courses; later
the student will use speaking and mathematics skills in upper level courses,
usually in the major. The college recognizes that mathematical application and
speaking skills are important enough to be considered in several courses; in
addition, they are essential for the quality we expect in a Rocky Mountain
College graduate. Upper level courses and those in the major are designed to
incorporate these principles and skills to provide the graduate with a
thorough grounding in them.

**Distribution:** The second area, distribution, is designed to ensure that
students are broadly educated, reflecting RMC's liberal arts character. In
order to reach the breath of vision which the college expects, the students
must take courses from these areas: the fine arts, the humanities, the social
sciences, and the natural sciences.

As an option in this area, students may elect a set of distribution courses
which reflect an overarching integrated concentration focused on an issue
outlined in the college's mission statement. At present, two such
concentrations have been approved: an environmental studies concentration and
an American studies concentration. Each of the concentrations includes courses
from the fine arts, the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural
sciences.

## General Education Requirements

### **Skills and Literacy**

**Writing:** ENG119 and one advanced writing course (6 semester hours).

**Mathematics:** Two courses (6 semester hours). PHR205 may be used as one of
these courses.

**Speaking:** Public Speaking or an approved acting course (3 semester hours).

**Computers:** CSC100 (3 semester hours).

**Health:** PEH115 (1 semester hour).

NOTE: Students may test out of all of the above.

### **Distribution**

The requirements in Option 1 or Option 2 below must be completed.

**Option 1:** Total Option 1: 25 semester hours.

**Fine Arts:** Two courses from art, theatre, and music, with no two from the
same program.

**Humanities:** One course in religious thought (3 credits) and two courses
from history, literature, and philosophy (6 semester hours) beyond the
requirement in religious thought, with no two from the same program; or two
courses in the same foreign language.

**Social Sciences:** Two courses from economics, political science,
psychology, sociology/anthropology, with no two from the same program.

**Natural Sciences:** Two courses from biology, chemistry, environmental
science, geology, and physics (at least one course must be a laboratory
course), with no two from the same program (unless they are both lab courses).

**Option 2:** An overarching, integrated concentration focused on an issue
outlined in the college's mission statement. Each concentration is to include
at least one course from the fine arts, two from the humanities, one from the
social sciences and natural sciences. Appropriate substitutions may be allowed
in all concentrations. Students choose from two concentrations.

**Environmental Studies Concentration:** 25 semester hours total.

BIO112, and either BIO315 or BIO410; or EES101 and EES200.  
ECO354.  
Two of HST365, PHR303, or PHR378.  
One of ART271 or ART323.  
EES225.  
IDS475.

**American Studies Concentration:** 25 semester hours total.

One of BIO111, BIO112, or EES101.  
Two of SOC101, SOC340, POL203, POL331, POL409, ECO201, or ECO203.  
One of ART323, MUS204, or MUS205.  
Two of HST211, HST212, HST311, or HST363.  
One of ENG381, ENG382, or ENG483.  
Seminar in American studies.

## Second Degree

A student may earn a second bachelor's degree at Rocky Mountain College by
taking a minimum of 30 additional credits in residence beyond the credits
earned for the first bachelor's degree, and completing all requirements for a
second major. Nine of the minimum additional credits for the second degree
must at the upper division level. Students at RMC may concurrently earn both
bachelor of science and bachelor of arts degrees if they have a minimum of 150
credits and have fulfilled all requirements for both degrees. Students may
also transfer to RMC to attain a second degree. These student must meet all
degree requirements outlined for transfer students to RMC. All students
wanting to obtain a second degree must file a written application to the
office of the registrar.

Back to top of page.

## Registration

Students are expected to register on the days specified. Registration is not
complete until financial arrangements are made with the business office. Late
validation fees are in effect after the first day of class. After one week of
classes, permission from the instructor must be obtained before entering a
course. After two weeks of classes, no student will be allowed to register in
regular classes.

## Classification of Students

Students are classified at the beginning of each semester in each academic
year.

### Official Status

**Regular:** Admission requirements fulfilled and systematically pursuing a
definite course of study toward a degree.  
**Conditional:** Does not meet requirements for regular admission. Must
establish regular (non-probationary) standing by the end of the first semester
in residence.  
**Special:** A student who is not a candidate for a degree at Rocky Mountain
College.  
**Auditor:** A student who attends class regularly but does not receive credit
or grade. A regular student may audit a course without charge, providing their
course load remains within the 12-19 credit range.

##  Registration Status

**Full-time:** A student registered for 12 hours or more.  
**Part-time:** A student registered for less than 12 hours.

##  Class Status

**Freshman:** A student who has earned less than 27 hours.  
**Sophomore:** A student who has earned 27 to 59 hours.  
**Junior:** A student who has earned from 60 to 89 hours.  
**Senior:** A student who has earned 90 or more hours.

Back to top of page.

## Academic Advisors

Academic advisors are assigned to students based on their area of major
interest upon entrance to Rocky Mountain College. Students are encouraged to
meet with their advisors frequently to review graduation requirements, plan
class schedules, and talk about their futures. Students may change academic
advisors at any time during the year by visiting with the Registrar or the
Academic Vice President and filing a request available in the office of the
registrar.

## Student Load

A normal load is considered to be 15 to 16 semester hours. Students in good
academic standing may register for up to a total of 19 semester hours with the
approval of their advisors. All other overload registrations must be approved
by the advisor and the Academic Vice President. For each semester hour over
19, a student is charged an overload fee.

NOTE: A student must average 15.5 semester hours for 8 semesters to complete
the required 124 semester hours.

## Part-time Enrollment

Once the student has enrolled at RMC, all course work in the major or to be
applied to the degree and/or certificate must be done in residence at RMC. If
the course work is to be done at another university or college, prior approval
should be obtained from an appropriately designated individual. Courses
submitted in transfer must have a grade of 'C' or better.

Back to top of page.

## Addition of a Course or Change of Section

Necessary registration changes, such as change in course or section, may be
made within two weeks of the beginning of the fall or spring semesters.
Students may not earn credit in any course for which they are improperly
registered or have failed to register.

## Withdrawal from a Course

A student may withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' up to and including
the last day to drop a class as published in the academic calendar. After that
day a student who withdraws from a course shall receive a grade of "F" in that
course. (Students who officially withdraw from school are not subject to this
regulation.) It is required that both the student's advisor and the instructor
concerned initial the withdrawal form obtained from the office of the
registrar. Failure to withdraw in the official manner will result in the grade
of "F". No withdrawal is official until the proper form has been filed in the
office of the registrar.

## Withdrawal from College

Students who withdraw from college, except for illness, must file an official
withdrawal request form. Written notification must be made to the Vice
President of Student Services in all cases of voluntary withdrawal. Failure to
withdraw in the official manner will result in a grade of "F" for each course.
(See withdrawal policies in financial assistance section.)

## Honorable Dismissal from College

Honorable dismissal of a student from Rocky Mountain College means 1) a clear
conduct record, 2) permission granted to withdraw voluntarily, and 3)
recommendation for favorable consideration for admission to other
institutions. It does not carry any implication as to the quality of the
student's work. It is granted to any eligible student upon request.

## Attendance

Students are expected to be in class regularly and promptly in order to do
satisfactory work. They are responsible for all assignments including written
lessons, quizzes, class tests, mid-term tests, final examinations, etc., even
when ill or representing Rocky Mountain College officially.

After warning students who have excessive absences (in writing) and notifying
the Academic Vice President of this warning, instructors may drop such
students from courses with grades of "F", by notifying the Registrar. The
Academic Vice President may, by written notice, place such students on a "no-
cut" basis in some classes or in all classes. If, after this notice is given,
the students are absent from class without adequate reason, the Academic Vice
President may dismiss such students from the college. In the event students
are dismissed under the terms of this paragraph, a grade of "F" will be
recorded in each course for which the students are registered.

## Academic Integrity

Academic integrity at Rocky Mountain College is based on a respect for
individual achievement that lies at the heart of academic culture. Every
faculty member and student belongs to a community of learners where academic
integrity is a fundamental commitment.

This statement broadly describes principles of student academic conduct
supported by all academic programs. It is the responsibility of every member
of the academic community to be familiar with these policies.

**Basic Standards of Academic Integrity**

Your registration at RMC implies your agreement with and requires adherence to
the College's standards of academic integrity. These standards cannot listed
exhaustively; however, the following examples represent some types of behavior
that violate the basic standards of academic integrity and are unacceptable:

1\. Cheating: using unauthorized notes, study aids, or information on an
examination; altering a graded work after it has been returned, then
submitting the work for regrading; allowing another person to do one's work
and submitting that work under one's own name; submitting identical or similar
papers for credit in more than one course without prior permission from the
course instructors.

2\. Plagiarism: submitting material that in part or whole is not entirely
one's own work without attributing those same portions to their correct
source; not properly attributing words or ideas to a source even if not
quoting directly; quoting from another author's writing without citing that
author's work including material taken from the World Wide Web, books and/or
papers; citing, with quotation marks, portions of another author's work but
using more of that work without proper attribution; taking a paper, in whole
or part, from a site on the Web or a "library" of already-written papers.

3\. Fabrication: falsifying or inventing any information, data or citation;
presenting data that were not gathered in accordance with standard guidelines
defining the appropriate methods for collecting or generating data and failing
to include an accurate account of the method by which the data were gathered
or collected.

4\. Obtaining an Unfair Advantage: (a) stealing, reproducing, circulating or
otherwise gaining access to examination materials prior to the time authorized
by the instructor; (b) stealing, destroying, defacing or concealing library
materials with the purpose of depriving others of their use; (c) unauthorized
collaborating on an academic assignment (d) retaining, possessing, using or
circulating previously given examination materials, where those materials
clearly indicate that they are to be returned to the instructor at the
conclusion of the examination; (e) intentionally obstructing or interfering
with another student's academic work or (f) otherwise undertaking activity
with the purpose of creating or obtaining an unfair academic advantage over
other students' academic work.

5\. Aiding and Abetting Academic Dishonesty: (a) providing material,
information, or other assistance to another person with knowledge that such
aid could be used in any of the violations stated above, or (b) providing
false information in connection with any inquiry regarding academic integrity.

6\. Falsification of Records and Official Documents: altering documents
affecting academic records; forging signatures of authorization or falsifying
information on an official academic document, grade report, letter of
permission, petition, drop/add form, ID card, or any other official College
document.

7\. Unauthorized Access to Computerized Academic or Administrative Records or
Systems: viewing or altering computer records, modifying computer programs or
systems, releasing or dispensing information gained via unauthorized access,
or interfering with the use or availability of computer systems or
information.

**Due Process and Student Rights**

Enforcement of the standards of academic integrity lies with the faculty and
academic division. In all cases involving academic dishonesty, the student
charged or suspected shall, at a minimum, be accorded the following rights:

1\. Apprized of the charge(s) against him or her.

2\. Provided with an opportunity to present information on his or her behalf.

3\. Be given the right to appeal any decision of the individual faculty member
to the Academic Vice President or Judicial Council. Appeals to the AVP must be
submitted in writing within 48 hours of the student being formally sanctioned.
Appeals utilizing the RMC judicial process should follow the procedures
outlined in the RMC "Trailguide."

**Sanctions**

All proven cases of academic dishonesty will be penalized as appropriate under
the circumstances. Individual faculty members may take the following actions:

1\. issue a private reprimand;  
2\. issue a formal letter of reprimand;  
3\. reduce the student's grade or fail him/her in the course.

All incidents of academic dishonesty will be reported to the college registrar
who reserves the right to forward the matter to the Academic Standards
Committee for further action. The Academic Standards Committee may take the
following actions:

1\. define a period of probation, with or without the attachment of
conditions;  
2\. withdraw College Scholarship funding;  
3\. define a period of suspension, with or without the attachment of
conditions;  
4\. expulsion from the College;  
5\. notation on the official record;  
6\. revocation of an awarded degree;  
7\. any appropriate combination of 1-6 above.

**Faculty and Administrative Responsibilities**

In order to implement these principles of academic integrity, it is necessary
for the administration and faculty to take certain steps that will discourage
academic dishonesty and protect academic integrity. Those steps include:

1\. RMC will regularly communicate to the college community its academic
standards and expectations through its institutional publications. Further,
the college will encourage and promote open dialog and discussion about issues
effecting academic integrity.

2\. Instructors should inform students of the academic requirements of each
course. Such information may include (a) notice of the scope of permitted
collaboration; (b) notice of the conventions of citation and attribution
within the discipline of the course; and (c) notice of the materials that may
be used during examinations and on other assignments.

## Examinations

Final examinations are given at the close of each semester. No change in the
stated schedule may be made except by the Academic Vice President.

Faculty members shall report the final grade for each student missing a final
examination as "F" unless this absence has been excused by the Academic Vice
President.

## Dead Week

With the exception of performance and laboratory examinations, no examinations
may be scheduled during the final academic week of classes. Any exceptions
must be approved by the Academic Vice President.

## Grade Points and Grade Point Average

In order to determine students' scholastic averages, grade points are awarded
for each hour of credit as follows: A - 4 points; B - 3 points; C - 2 points;
D - 1 point; F - 0 points. Grades of I and W are not used in computation of
the GPA. A plus (+) or minus (-) does not change the value of the grade for
computation of the GPA.

Scholastic average is determined by dividing the number of earned grade points
by the number of attempted credit hours. This is the GPA (grade point
average), which is used in the classification of students; in determining
academic probation, eligibility, and scholastic honors; and in granting of
degrees.

The GPA is understood to mean cumulative GPA unless indicated for one
semester. Grade point average for all uses in the college shall be based on
all courses accepted in transfer and all courses attempted at Rocky Mountain
College. When a student repeats a course, the later grade will count.

## Grades

Grades in courses are recorded as follows:

A - Superior, B - Excellent, C - Average, D - Passing, P - Pass, NP-No Pass
(see below), F - Failure, I - Incomplete, X - No grade received from the
instructor, and W - Withdrawn. All grades except I and X become a matter of
permanent record.

The I grade is given only under unusual circumstances and with the
instructor's consent. The instructor must file a completed Request for Grade
of Incomplete in the office of the registrar before the assignment of a grade
as I (incomplete). An I must be made up within one year. After one year it
will be permanently recorded as an "F".

A grade of "F" can be made up only by repeating the course. The previous "F"
is not removed from the permanent record, but is removed from the GPA
calculation. Students who have an "F" in required courses should give
precedence to re-taking those courses in planning subsequent schedules.

Grades not submitted to the Registrar by the due date will be recorded as X.
Grades not received from faculty by 10 days after the grade due date will be
recorded as "F". Grades submitted to the office of the registrar are final and
may not be changed except upon request of the instructor. No grade change can
be made more than one year after the end of the semester in which the course
was taken.

## Pass-No Pass Grading Option

Junior and senior students may elect to take one course on a pass/no pass
basis each semester of their last two years in residence at Rocky Mountain
College. The student must indicate (to the office of the registrar) a decision
to enter a course on a pass/no pass basis within two weeks of the beginning of
the semester.

Faculty will turn in letter grades to the office of the registrar. To receive
a grade of "Pass" in this context, the student must achieve a grade of C or
better. Students are warned that many graduate and professional schools equate
a grade of P with a grade of C in determining admission to the school.

The following courses will be graded on a pass-no pass basis only: all
aviation flight labs, CAP110N, COM247/347, PSY450, field practicums (291,
391), IDS220, music recital courses (MUS020, 030, 040), varsity sports
(PEH100), physical education activity courses (PEH101, PEH102), and drama
activity courses (THR137, THR138). All other courses will be graded on the
regular basis (A,B,C,D,F) unless noted. Any exceptions must be approved by the
Academic Vice President in consultation with members of the faculty Council of
Chairs. A grade of pass/no pass is not used in computing the GPA.

## Graduation with Honors

Honors at graduation are designated for bachelor of arts and bachelor of
science degrees as follows: summa cum laude, GPA 3.80; magna cum laude, GPA
3.60; cum laude, GPA 3.40.

The grade point average for graduation with honors is computed on the basis of
all courses attempted, both at Rocky Mountain College and at any other
college. The GPA for all work taken at Rocky Mountain College must be above
the level for the honor awarded.

## Application for Graduation

All students intending to graduate during the following year must file an
application for graduation by October 31. Applications received after October
31 incur a late graduation fee. Graduation ceremonies for the academic year
are in early May.

## Dean's List

Students who carry a full load (12 or more semester hours) of work graded with
grade points and who earn a GPA of 3.60 or higher for the semester are placed
on the Dean's List. Those with a GPA of 4.00 for the semester will be
recognized with high honors. These students will be recognized at the fall and
spring convocations.

Names of students with I (incomplete) grades for the semester will not be
placed on these lists.

## Report of Grades

Mid-semester grade reports are progress reports and thus provide students with
excellent opportunities to consult with instructors about problems they may be
having. Mid-semester grade reports are available on CampusWeb after mid-term
break. These grades are not recorded on the permanent records. Final grades in
courses are recorded on the permanent records in the office of the registrar.

Final grades will be available on CampusWEB approximately one week after the
end of the term. Students may request that grades be mailed to an address of
their choice by notifying the office of the registrar before the beginning of
finals week. Final grades will be mailed upon request only.

## Transcripts

Transcripts are available upon the student's written request to the office of
the registrar. No transcripts will be issued within two weeks of Commencement.
A transcript will not be issued unless the student is in good financial
standing with the college.

## Academic Standing/Probation and Suspension

Students at Rocky Mountain College are expected to make progress toward
attaining their degrees. The criteria for good academic standing are as
follows:

  * Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 1.75 until completing 26 semester credits. 

  * Students must maintain a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00 every semester thereafter (after completing 27 credits).

  * Transfer students also must maintain an overall cumulative GPA of at least 2.00, as well as a cumulative GPA of 2.00 in the credits attempted at Rocky Mountain College. Any student with a semester GPA of 1.00 or lower will be placed on probation or suspended. Rocky Mountain College reserves the right to suspend any student whose semester GPA is 1.00 or less.
  * NOTE: In addition, a student must have a cumulative GPA of 2.25 in the major to graduate.

All students are reviewed by the academic standards committee at the end of
each semester. Students who do not maintain good standing as defined above
will be placed on academic probation or suspended. Students who do not make
academic progress to remove probationary status after one semester will be
suspended from the college. A student will be continued on probation if he or
she earns at least a 2.00 GPA during the semester of probation, and the
committee determines that the student is making progress toward graduation.

A student may appeal an academic suspension by indicating in writing the
reasons why he or she did not make satisfactory academic progress, and
submitting a plan for improvement. The appeal must be made within 15 days of
notification of suspension and directed to the Academic Vice President.

Suspended students may be re-admitted after one semester's absence. Re-
admission requires submission of an application for re-admission to the office
of the registrar, and consideration by the academic standards committee. If
re-admission is approved, the probationary status shall be continued until
good academic standing is restored.

Students may lose eligibility for financial aid while on probation. Check with
the financial aid office for more information.

## Academic Dismissal

If, after re-admission to the college, a student is suspended a second time,
the student is dismissed with no further opportunity to enroll at Rocky
Mountain College. Suspension and dismissal are permanently recorded on the
student's transcript.

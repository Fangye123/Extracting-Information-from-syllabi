###  COURSE DESCRIPTION

**"Theory is the sound made by the shifting ice floes of academic disciplines,
breaking up or grinding against one another."  
     \-- Stefan Collini

"Theory is the name for the questions that arise when the answers we have
about a topic no longer seem adequate to our understanding."  
    \-- Gerald Graff 

"The only theory worth having is that which you have to fight off, not that
which you speak with profound fluency."  
    \-- Stuart Hall 

"By reinforcing the idea that there is a split between theory and practice or
by creating such a split, [we] deny the power of liberatory education for
critical consciousness, thereby perpetuating conditions that reinforce our
collective exploitation and repression."  
    \-- bell hooks 

The aim of this course is to introduce (or reintroduce) graduate students to
some of the major theories and methods currently practiced in cultural studies
and related interdisciplines, such as ethnic, American, women's and queer
studies. The course is organized along two overlapping axes: 1) we will
examine _key concepts,_ including "culture," "race," "ethnicity," "formation,"
"class," "hegemony," "gender," "sexuality" and "imperialism"; and 2) we will
discuss various _elaborated theoretical positions,_ including race/ethnicity
theories, marxisms, feminisms, post-structuralisms, queer, and post-colonial
theories. While for purposes of analysis we will at times isolate these
concepts and theories from one another, much of our work will _emphasize
conceptual and theoretical intersections._ Throughout the course grand
questions of theory and method will be grounded via examination of applied
scholarship on U.S. culture.

Questions of method will be approached throughout the course using a diverse
body of applied texts that we will examine in terms of the relation between
the theoretical questions addressed and the methods used to test those
questions. The course aims to show that theoretical questions should always
inform the choice of methods, and that, in turn, methods used well will
generate new theoretical questions. The methods we will examine include:
several kinds of archival historical research, cultural ethnography, oral
history, and several varieties of rhetorical and textual analysis.

Such a quick survey cannot hope to do justice to these complex theories and
methods, so the goal is to provide the tools to increase your literacy in
reading theory and lay the groundwork for further study. The syllabus is a
negotiable outline. We may add, subtract or otherwise change readings and
topics as the interests and needs of the participants become clearer.

###  REQUIREMENTS

 Grading for the course will be based on the following:

1\. ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN SEMINAR DISCUSSIONS. This is a discussion class,
with only occasional mini-lectures as requested. Active participation in
discussions is part of the commitment one makes in joining the class
community. [20%]

2\. WEBSITE REVIEW of the "Theory and Method" web pages. Choose one of the
sections (or one subsection of the "Race, Gender, and Sexuality" page),
familiarize yourself with the citations; analyze the inclusions and
exclusions; suggest additions with annotations; and suggest changes to the
section intro and/or annotations to make the site more user-friendly and
effective. Suggestions for other changes to the site, including reorganized or
new sections, new links, better navigation, or other possibilities for
improving the site are also welcome. [10%]      DUE ON MARCH 6th

3\. CRITICAL BOOK REVIEW of an assigned book, written as if for a scholarly
journal and _emphasizing questions of theory and method._ Reviews should not
exceed 4 typed, double-spaced pages. Eligible books are those by: Pulido,
Deloria, Gaspar de Alba, Perez, Sandoval, Jagose, and Gamson. Reviews are due
by the second session we discuss the book in class. [10%]

4\. SEMINAR FACILITATION Each of you will serve as facilitator of the
discussion for two or three sessions over the course of the semester. This
entails reading the pieces assigned on those days with special care, doing
some background, contextualizing research as needed, and serving as resident
expert that day for the texts in question. Preparation will also include
writing up and e-mailing to all class members discussion questions on the
reading at least two days before the discussion. [20%]

5\. SEMINAR PAPER  
a) analyzing a theoretical issue that interests you; OR  
b) applying theories and methods drawn from class readings to a text or topic
that interests you ; OR  
c) offering a draft theoretical introduction to a thesis or topic you are
working on; OR  
d) "translating" (bell hooks' term) the most useful ideas of the "academic"
theory we read this semester for a specific, non-academic audience (i.e.,
union organizers; high school students; etc.), and for use on the "Theory and
Method" website. Approximately 12-20 pp. [40%]     DUE MAY 9th

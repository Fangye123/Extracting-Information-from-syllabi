**TEXTS  
**

**Required**

  * Albert C. Baugh & Thomas Cable, **_A History of the English Language,_** Fourth Edition, (Prentice Hall, 1993).  

**Recommended (on RESERVE at the Reinert Alumni Library):**

  * Celia M. Millward, _**A Biography of the English Language**_
  * Thomas Pyles & John Algeo, _**The Origins and Development of the English Language**_
  * **_The Story of English_** (5 videotapes)  





**COURSE REQUIREMENTS  
**

### **1) Term Project (25%)**

Students will design and pursue a creative, analytical, or research project
(paper, videotaped documentary, web site, art work, etc.) related to any
aspect of the use or other features of the English language in any of its
historical periods (including the present and future). All projects must also
be presented to the class. Projects may be papers (analytical and/or research)
tracing, describing, analyzing, and explaining specific features of the
language and their historical foundations (MLA format required of all papers).
Projects may also take the form of practical studies of or gathering and
analyzing of data on current usages of the language in specific contexts (for
example, regional dialects, slang, origins of words, peculiarities of
pronunciation, etc.). Projects addressing issues in current phonology (the
sound of the language) may want to make use of audio/video recordings and may
also be accompanied by a written paper. In general, students are encouraged to
choose material which is interesting and stimulating and should not feel
limited to traditional academic topics. Art works are acceptable provided they
yield substantial insight into some aspect of the language and its historical
use. Projects may be undertaken individually or by groups (group projects need
to be substantial and extensive enough to justify the participation of two or
more people). All projects must be approved by the instructor in advance (see
Schedule below).



### 2) Group Presentations (15%)

  * Students will be divided into groups (2-3 people each) which will take turns in making presentations on selected topics. Students will be responsible for reading about and researching the assigned topic and presenting their findings to the class. In addition to reading the specific textbook assignments, students are encouraged to pursue relevant library research in order to enrich their presentations. All presentations must strive to be interesting and engaging, concentrating on the clear exposition of the highlights of the material and representative illustrations, examples, and/or anecdotes. Highly encouraged, whenever possible, is the use of audiovisual materials (pictures, slides, videotapes, audio recordings, multimedia computer presentations, etc.). All presentations will be followed by discussion and question/answer periods. Presentations should generally be 15-30 minutes in length. 

### 3) Exams (50%)

  * Students will take three exams covering the materials studied. Exams will include objective, short answer, and essay questions.

### 3) Other (10%)

  * Class participation, attendance, effort, attentiveness, preparation, responsibility, and, in general, active and constructive involvement in all aspects of the course **** will also be taken into consideration in the course grade.

**GRADING AND OTHER POLICIES  
  
Deadlines: ** Make-ups/extensions for a missed deadline will only be given in
cases of documented serious illness or other valid, non-frivolous excuse such
as documented participation in official University sports or academic/service
events (it will be up to the instructors to determine and decide on the
acceptability of an excuse). Otherwise, students must meet all deadlines
specified in the syllabus.

**Student Conduct and Academic Honesty:** All students in the class are
expected to observe the University's guidelines on student conduct as
described in Creighton University's Student Handbook (see "Code of Conduct,"
and especially the section on "Academic Misconduct" dealing with problems of
plagiarism, cheating, etc.). Plagiarism-- the _unacknowledged_ use of outside
help and sources (books, articles, other student papers or ideas, etc.)--will
result in failing the assignment and/or the entire course.

**Grading:** Grading: All aspects of the course will be graded on a 0-100
point scale where 90-100 = A, 87-89 = B+, 80-86 = B, 77-79 = C+, 70-76 = C,
60-69 = D, and 0-59 = F. The course grade will be calculated according to the
following formula:

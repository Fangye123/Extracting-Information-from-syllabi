Required Textbook for Course:  
_Humankind Emerging: The Concise Edition_ , by Bernard G. Campbell & James D.
Loy (2002)  
    


**Course Description:**

This course is a general introduction to the field of biological anthropology
focusing on the evolutionary history of the human species.  Through a
combination of lectures, reading assignments, and discussion, we will examine
humans and nonhuman primates (monkeys, apes, and prosimians) and their
ancestors from a biological and evolutionary perspective.  We will begin with
the fundamentals of modern evolutionary theory and genetic inheritance as
background material.  Next, we will look at biological and genetic variation
among modern humans.  We will then examine morphological and behavioral
variation among nonhuman primates to gain perspective on the evolution of
human biology and behavior.  Finally, we will trace the fossil record of human
evolution from the first primates to modern humans, focusing on the biological
and behavioral changes that have occurred during the course of human
evolution.  
    
    
  
  

**Course Requirements, Exams and Grading:**

LECTURE ATTENDANCE:  I expect and strongly encourage you to attend every class
period.  You should take comprehensive notes during lectures, as your lecture
notes will be your primary source of information when studying for exams.  I
will also give handouts during some lectures.  If you miss a class, it is your
responsibility to make sure that you make up the material you missed by (1)
getting the lecture notes from one of your classmates and (2) picking up
copies of the handouts (available in Kissena 06-A) before the next class
period.

LATENESS:  Arriving late to class disrupts the lecture and is disrespectful to
others.  I will take note of those who are habitually late and will take this
into account when determining the "effort" portion of your grade.  Attendance
sheets will be circulated at the beginning of each class period, so you will
not be counted as present for that day if you are more than 5 minutes late to
class.

READINGS:  The readings for each lecture topic are listed below.  Page numbers
indicate the assigned pages from your textbook.  Other readings, listed by
author, are on reserve at Rosenthal Library.  You will be responsible for the
material from all assigned readings.

EXAMS:  There will be three exams: two during the semester and one semi-
cumulative final exam.  Exams will be based on the lectures, handouts, and
readings.  The first exam will cover material from the first third of the
course, the second exam will cover material from the second third of the
course, and the final exam will cover the entire semester but will focus
mainly on material from the last third of the course.

MAKEUP EXAMS:  Exams cannot be made up except in cases of medical emergencies.
If you know in advance that you will be unable to attend an exam for a very
important but non-emergency reason, then you must speak to me at least one
week in advance of the scheduled exam date and I will give you a make-up exam
prior to the scheduled exam.

 GRADING: Each exam will be worth 32% of your grade.  The remaining 4% of your
grade will be based on my evaluation of the amount of effort you put into the
class, as demonstrated by your class participation (attendance and
punctuality) and your improvement throughout the semester.

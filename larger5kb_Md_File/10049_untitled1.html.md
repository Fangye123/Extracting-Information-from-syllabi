**Course Description:** Second semester course in conversational and written

**Course Objectives:** These are as follows:  
  
**1) Develop Linguistic Skills in Portuguese:** Continued refinement of the
Novice Low Level language skills begun in Portuguese 1A while working toward
the Novice Mid and High Levels. ***** This includes greater accuracy in the
use of increasingly more complex skills in listening comprehension, speaking,
reading, and writing. This is characterized by the improved ability to
understand and to produce appropriate responses in common situations utilizing
learned materials. The student acquires an expanded ability to understand
discourse on an increased number of topics, such as: educational systems,
leisure-time activities, housing, daily routines expressed in a variety of
modes (present, past, future, conditional actions). The student's
listening/reading vocabulary expands to 1600-2000 words.  
  
  
**2) Develop Cultural Awareness of Luso-Brazilian-African Cultures:**  
  
Cultural awareness at the Mid or High Novice Level ***** is characterized by a
familiarity with a broader range of Portuguese cultural topics, such as family
relationships, national celebrations, attitudes toward health and fitness,
work habits, the educational system, etc. Discussions concerning the 2000 word
cultural assignment provides information concerning Portuguese-speaking
countries (Portugal, Azores, Madeira, Brazil, Cape Verde, Angola, Mozambique,
Timor, Dio, Damao, Goa, Macao) to include geography, cultural diversity, etc.
The Mid or High Novice Level is also characterized by the continued
development of a sensitivity to cultural stereotyping, sources of cross-
cultural misunderstanding, cultural aspects of language, and a sample of
contributions of Portuguese-speaking cultures to science, the arts, and to
American life including that of California.

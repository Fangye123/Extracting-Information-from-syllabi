Psy 34 Educational Psychology  
---  
Spring 2001  
TT 9:30-10:50 HC 4  
  
  
  
  
The course examines the intersections between the field of psychology and the
world of education. Education necessarily reflects the concerns of the larger
society, the local community, the family and the individual child. Students
will:  

1\. examine such topics as developmentally appropriate education, teaching
effectiveness, individual differences, and managing students in groups which
require understanding of both psychological theory and research and
educational research and practice  
2\. study alternative theoretical approaches to addressing contemporary
challenges in education  
3\. practice critical reading, writing, listening and collaborative skills in
class and in written assignments.

  
  
**Required Readings:**  
Lefrancois, Guy (2000) _Psychology for teaching,_ tenth edition Belmont CA:
Wadsworth  
  
**Requirements:**  
Your final grade will be based on:  

  * two exams (the final is non-cumulative) 
  * two book reviews 
  * two interviews 
  * term paper 
  * presentations/participation 
  
  
**Grading:**  
Each exam is worth 200 points; each book review(2) and interview synopsis(2)
is worth 100 points. The oral/group participation grade is based on 100
points. The term paper/final project is worth 100 points. Final grades will be
based on the following:  
A| (>95%)| 761-800 pts.| | C | (73-77%)|  585-616 pts.  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
A-| (90-95%)| 721-960 pts.| | C-| (70-73%)| 561-584 pts.  
B+| (87-90%)| 697-720 pts.| | D+| (67-70%)| 537-560 pts.  
B| (83-87%)| 665-696 pts.| | D| (63-67%)| 605-536 pts.  
B-| (80-83%)| 641-664 pts.| | D-| (60-63%)| 481-504 pts.  
C+| (77-80%)| 617-640 pts.| | F| (<60%)| 480 pts.  
561 or more points are required for an S. In all cases, critical thinking will
be the primary criterion differentiating a superior product from a good one.
Please check with me if you have questions about your standing in the course.  
  
**Presentation/Participation:**  
You must present at least one book review or your final project in class.
There will be limited opportunities to sign up for times to present book
reviews; no book will be orally reviewed more than once. The balance of the
participation grade will derive from peer editing of book reviews and
participation in class.  
  
**Book Reviews:**  
Your book reviews can be presented to the class individually, by pairs or by
trios of students. The value of working with one or more others is that it
ensures that multiple perspectives are brought to bear on the analysis of
texts. Having a balanced presentation will be helpful to our discussion.  
  
**Exams:**  
There will be two tests. They will be essay exams with in-class and take-home
portions, each portion worth 100 points.  
  
**Final paper:**  
You will write a term paper using a minimum of five sources (none published
before 1995 unless you have my permission), pertaining to any topic related to
the course. Two copies of a two to three sentence statement of purpose and
your bibliography will be due April 19th. I will be making available a variety
of options for work in the community and will encourage you to link your topic
to a volunteer placement if you choose one.  
  
**Attendance:**  
You are responsible for all announcements, materials, deadlines, and
information presented in any class that you miss. Failing to appear when you
are working with a partner or responsible for a presentation will lower your
grade by a minimum of one letter grade. Betraying your peers by not showing up
will yield an F for you on that assignment. I am inclined to be unsympathetic
to concerns about the course when a student has consistently missed class.  
  
**Late penalties:**  
You have two "days of grace" in the course. Ordinarily if an assignment is
due, I regard it as "on time" if I find it in my office (HC 327) or my email
by 8:30 on morning after it's due. If it's due Tuesday, anything I receive
before Wednesday at 8:30 or so is one day late (a weekend and Spring Break are
one "day" ). You may be late two days during the semester with no penalty.
After that, I penalize you one-half a letter grade for each late day.  
  
**Academic Integrity:**  
The Academic Integrity principle applies in this course principally to matters
of plagiarism and cheating. Talk with me in advance of any action on your part
that might lead to one of these charges. I want you to talk together, study
together, share ideas and work well together. However, I expect each
assignment you submit to be uniquely your own. Integrity is essential in every
profession and vital if you plan to teach.  
  
**First interview:**  
Your first interview involves talking with two people about their early
experiences as students. Find people (of any age) and ask each of the
following questions:  

1\. What are your earliest memories of school?  
  
2\. Who are the people you most remember from school --- friends, teachers,
the principal, the nurse, the bus driver, etc.? How did they affect your
experience of school?  
  
3\. Did you like school? Do you remember a point in elementary school at which
you stopped liking school? What happened?  
  
4\. How did your physical development and appearance affect your experience of
school? Were you big or small, similar to or different from classmates in ways
that affected you? Were there other differences that affected you (e.g., you
moved a lot or you were the principal's daughter).  
  
5\. Compared with other kids in your grade, did you experience yourself as
fortunate, well-prepared, capable or the opposite of these?  
  
6\. Is there a point at which your attitude toward middle or high school
changed dramatically for better or worse? What happened?

  
  
You may want to show your prospective "subjects" the questions ahead of time.
Be sure to followup where it's needed so you'll be able to explain your
subjects' points of view in class and in writing. We will discuss your
interviews in class. A written synopsis with an introduction, a summary of the
interviews, your critical reflections about them and the relationships between
them, and a conclusion is due at that time. Your reflections are the most
essential determinant of your final grade --- what did you learn? What do you
think? The written synopsis is usually 3-4 pages long.  
  
**Book reviews:**  
In your oral presentation, you will have only fifteen minutes or so to provide
a synopsis of your book, highlighting the most important themes and points the
author makes. Talk about the strengths and weaknesses you saw in the book,
including at least three questions you would have liked the author to tackle
in his/her next work. I prefer that you use the first person in order to
differentiate for me when you are speaking "in your own voice" from when you
are telling me what someone else is saying. If you are part of a group, I will
expect you to organize who does what in the oral presentation and have a
timekeeper. Expect a few minutes for questions after you finish.  
Your written book review should have an introduction, the synopsis, strengths
and weaknesses, questions (see above) and a conclusion with the reference (and
any others) provided at the end. Each of you will submit a separate book
review even if you collaborate on the oral presentation. The books differ a
great deal so feel free to talk with me about how best to develop either your
oral or your written presentation. Most edited volumes will be difficult to
work with; they may be better for final projects.  
What follows is a lengthy list of books available at Abell and the editing
instructions. You will often find similar titles on the shelves near these and
are welcome to ask me if a substitute book is okay to use.

**Instructions for first draft and editing**  
When your first draft is due, give me two copies, each one without your name
but with your box# instead. The basic outline to follow in the book review is
earlier in this syllabus. I prefer that you use the first person in order to
differentiate for me when you are speaking "in your own voice" from when you
are telling me what someone else is saying. When you give me your paper, I
will tell you which group you are in for editing. By the following morning,
the folders will be on two-hour closed reserve and in my office (with Sandra
Holt). When you give me your editing, indicate the Group, the box # of the
author of the draft, and the box# of the editor (you). Tell me and the author:  

  * what you liked best about the draft --- be specific and be sure you offer some measure of praise in each critique you write  
  

  * what problems you have --- refer to page and paragraph for typos, lack of clarity, or any other concerns  

  * what questions you have --- being sure the author will understand where they fit in  

  * any other reactions, suggestions, etc.
  
I expect people to have different styles of editing and different preferences
for style. My hope is that you'll enjoy reading others' work and getting
feedback from benevolent editors.  
  
**APA Style Instructions:**  
For Karen's papers, the only APA guidelines you must follow are to:  
  
* Use parenthetic references (Jones, 1993) instead of footnotes or endnotes; if you are quoting directly, include the page #, e.g.,(Smith  & Winston, 1993, p. 435).  
  
* Your reference list should be alphabetized and use this style: 

Joyce, B. & Weil, M. (1986). _Models of teaching_ [or italicize} Englewood
Cliffs, NJ: Prentice hall.  
  
Keller, F.S. (1966). _A personal course in psychology_. In R. Urlich, T.
Stachnik,  & J. Mabry (Eds.) Control of human behavior (Vol.1) Glenview, IL:
Scott, Foresman.  
  
Maier, N.R.F. (1933) _An aspect of human reasoning_. British Journal of
Psychology, 24, 144-155.

* When a direct quote is longer than about five lines, indent it; don't put quotes on either end but do include the parenthetic reference as indicated above, at the end.  
While some valuable information is available from the world wide web, much of
it constitutes anecdotal reporting at best and marketing drivel at worst.
Standard APA format is: Document retrieved 19 June 1997 http: www/ and the
rest of the URL. Be sure you search ERIC and other databases available thru'
Abell; also see my AC webpage for some interesting websites.  
  
**Final project/Paper:**  
Your final paper should take the following form:  

1\. Title, your name, and date  
  
2\. Introduction - Why ought anyone to be interested in your topic? Your job
here is to hook the reader into wanting to read your paper.  
  
3\. Statement of purpose - What are your goals for the paper? Be careful not
to just present a thesis statement. In psychology, you must document any
assertion of "fact." As a result, if you assert your thesis with no reasoning
or context, I'll challenge you, particularly if you seem to go into the paper
with a bias that you don't examine carefully in your critique below.  
  
4\. Body - Summarize what you learned whether from your project or by reading
(see APA guidelines in syllabus for additional information). Feel free to use
"I" and a casual style; what is most important to me is that it's obvious when
you are speaking with your own voice and when you are telling me what others
have to say.  
  
5\. Critical analysis - Systematically evaluate the strengths and weaknesses
of what you read (or in the case of projects, saw). If you have done a
wonderful job so far but don't criticize well, you won't be able to get better
than a B on the paper.  
  
6\. Conclusion - Draw a general conclusion.  
  
7\. References - APA style

  
  
**Second interview:**  
Since your second interview may be with any of a wide range of professionals,
I have tried to make it fairly general. Share with him/her the questions below
so s/he'll have had some time to think before you begin the actual interview.
Ask follow-up questions and explore topics of special interest to you. If you
fail to do so when the person you're talking with has invited it, I'll lower
your grade. That means you would be wise to **(1)** have an appointment and
**(2)** plan to take an hour or so. In your synopsis, write an introduction, a
conclusion, and your own reflections about the interview. What surprised,
impressed, disturbed or otherwise was notable for you? Begin the interview by
getting a clear sense of the nature and scope of the responsibilities of the
person you're talking with so that the frame of reference s/he brings to the
interview will be clear. (e.g., Why did you enter this field? Besides student,
what roles in education have you had? How long have you been in your current
position?).  

  * As you look to education in the 21st century, how do you see education as needing to change? What would your goals be in making those changes?  
  

  * In your view, what are the biggest threats to quality education right now?  
  

  * Have you seen models of educational reform or innovation that you see as especially promising? What do they look like?  
  

  * Are the threats fundamentally different from the way things were ten years ago? If yes, how?  
  

  * Are the interactions of parents, teachers, administrators, and school boards more or less positive than they were when you were a student? What has influenced the changes?  
  

  * If money were no object, how would you change your school? Why?  
  

  * If you could improve the preparation of future professionals at your school, what would you recommend
  
Be sure to express your gratitude for his/her taking the time to talk with you
at the end of the interview.

**Course Description** : Since the Hellenistic period of the Mediterranean and
Near East collectively worshipped at the cult of powerful individuals, it
seems appropriate to approach it by studying individuals. From Alexander the
Great to Gaius Octavius (alias Augustus) we are presented with an astonishing
string of megalomaniacal imperialists. It is only in this context that Rome's
meteoric rise to prominence becomes comprehensible, and in this context that
we can understand the decline of republican values that left autocratic rule
of the whole empire in the hands of Alexander's highly self-conscious
imitator, Julius Caesar. Therefore this course will concentrate on three
topics: the tactics and careers of the most powerful and influential
individuals; the biographical historiography arising around them; and the
historical forces that led to and sustained such an autocratic period.

Course Description: This course is a study of human services systems that have
evolved as a response to the characteristics of urban society, and the
organizations which function as components of the system.

Human services are vast and complex patterns of providing needed and wanted
services to human beings within the context of the larger environment.
Ranging in size from one-person operations to large, multi-national
enterprises, the operation and management of nonprofits have in common certain
administrative characteristics. This course introduces the student to
nonprofit management and exposes the student to various types of nonprofit
organizations.   Experiences throughout the course are intended to provide
individuals with an understanding of the complexities of nonprofits and to
assist the student to come to an understanding of the heterogeneous nature of
human services.  Exercises are designed so the student can begin to develop an
appreciation of the management of nonprofits, the place of nonprofits in the
scheme of services and the problems/opportunities confronting nonprofit
agencies.  The course is also designed to assist the students in exploring
possible careers within nonprofit administration and to assist the student in
clarifying career goals.

Knowledge Goals

Relative to cognitive development, the overarching goal this semester is to
study nonprofit organizations as a part of the larger society, how they have
developed and the context within which they exist. In order to accomplish this
goal, several topics will be explored:  


  *  the historical development of nonprofit organizations
  *  the bases for nonprofit organizations: needs and wants
  *  nonprofit organizations: diversity and scope
  *  management issues in nonprofit administration
  *  jobs and careers in nonprofit organizations
  *  the future of nonprofit organizations

  
    
    


Skills Development Goals

The HSRV faculty have determined that the introductory course for nonprofit
administrations, students will, by the end of the semester, be able to
demonstrate a modicum of proficiency in each of the following areas:  
\- the ability to organize and deliver a quality classroom presentation,  
\- the ability to use media to enhance the quality of the classroom
presentation,  
\- the ability to conduct a data-based search,  
\- the ability to write a systematic research paper, including appropriate
citation and referencing,  
\- the ability to use the computer as a word-processing tool,  
\- the ability to use the computer to conduct a group meeting; and  
\- the ability to use critical thinking in the analysis and development of a
paper.

Class Format: The class will be conducted using a variety of methods.
Although some of the information will be provided through lecture, student
discussion and participation is very important.  In addition to instructor
provided direction, small group activities, field trips, classroom
presentations, class writings, Web activities and student reports will be
used.

Course Requirements and Grading: A total of 1006 points possible.  These
points will  
be earned through completing the following requirements:  
Exams.  (100 points) One final exam will be given.  
Paper.  (500 points) Each student will write a research paper on a nonprofit  
organization.  The instructor must approve the selection of the organization
to be studied by the student. Points will include:  
50 points for title and focus statement,  
100 points for bibliography,  
100 points for a full-sentence outline,  
100 points for the draft of the paper and  
150 points for final paper.  
The paper and requirements will be discussed in class. Drafts of materials
will be reviewed and returned to the student.  
Agency Interview. (100 points)  Students will be required to interview a CEO  
of a nonprofit agency in the area of study.  A professional letter must be
sent to the CEO requesting an interview  
Class Presentations (100 points) Each student will be expected to regularly  
lead the class in a discussion of various topics related to the course.  Two
presentations are to be planned and delivered in a ten-minute time frame.
Presentations will be scored 50 points per presentation.  Students listening
to the presentation are expected to craft one or two questions to ask the
presenter.  Material from the presentations will be included in the final
examination.  Work teams will be selected during the first two class periods
with the intent that the work teams will help each other on their research,
case studies and individual presentations, though the individual student is
responsible for his or her own presentation.  Students are encouraged to be
creative in their presentations.  The first presentation will be a student
leading the class on the results of the group analysis of the case study area
assigned.   The student must use an instructor-approved method of media
presentation (50 points).  The second presentation will be the individual
research project and must include an executive summary to be distributed to
classmates (50 points).  
Group Work (50 points) At the end of the term each student will be asked to  
evaluate the participation effort of members of the group.  A maximum of 50  
points will be awarded for this activity.  
Field trips. (100 points) As per class discussion, field trips will be
arranged.  
Students will be awarded 25 points for each field trip in which the student
participates. Trips will be arranged for class time. Substitution for excused
absences can be arranged at the desecration of the instructor.  
Participation Points.  (56 points)  The class is scheduled to meet 28 times  
throughout the semester.  Each student will receive two points for each class
fully attended, including field trips. A sign-in sheet will be distributed at
the beginning of class.  Ten minutes after the sign-in sheet has been
distributed the instructor will collect it.  Anyone not signing by time the
sheet is picked-up will be considered absent for the day.

Grades will be awarded based on the standard percentages per grade level.  (A
for 90% or better, B for 80-89%, C for 70-79%, D for 60-69%, F for 59% and
below.)   870 possible points.

Students not knowing how to word-process or use media for presentations will
be expected to work with the instructor to obtain rudimentary skills in these
areas.  No additional credit will be awarded for these activities.

Disability: If you have a disability that may require assistance or
accommodations, or you have questions related to any accommodations for
testing, note takers, readers, etc., please speak with your professor as soon
as possible.  Students may contact the Office for Students with
Disabilities/College Access Program at 755-4006 with questions about services
offered to UTC students with qualified disabilities.

Changes:  The instructor reserves the right to alter course content,
assignments and scheduled dates as warranted by the progress through the
course material.  It is the responsibility of the student to keep informed of
changes, new material, missed content, etc.

Attendance:  While attendance is not required, the instructor believes
strongly that students learn from interaction within class and in class
activities.  Discussion concepts talked about in class, which are not part of
a formal lecture, will be tested.  Students missing class are expected to know
the content of the discussion, even though they were not present.
Participation points, as noted above, are given to encourage students to
attend and participate in the class. No points for the presentation will be
given to individuals on days missed when their presentation is scheduled.  If
you anticipate missing a scheduled day, it is your responsibility to advise
the instructor in advance.

Group Work:  Students will be assigned to work groups in which they will
participate throughout the semester.  Groups will be expected to provide a
written statement regarding individual expectations of the group and sanctions
by the group if an individual member does not fulfill his/her agreed upon
obligations.  Group work will primarily focus on the case studies with one
student responsible for the presentation of the group discussions.  Presenters
will be rotated so each individual group member will present at least once.
If time permits, individual group meetings can be conducted on the internet
with the instructor as observer.

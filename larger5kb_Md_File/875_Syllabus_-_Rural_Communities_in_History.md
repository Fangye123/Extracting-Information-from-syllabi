**Objectives:** This course examines rural communities in Europe and the
United States from the late Middle Ages to the twentieth century. We will be
considering how groups in different places and times organized their social
lives. Studying their communities will enable us to reflect on the communities
we grew up in and are a part of today.

> > **By the end of this course, you should be able to:** 1) describe
different types of communities in history and in the world today; 2) give a
brief history of rural communities in Europe and the United States from 1500
to the present

>>

>> The course also provides an introduction to the academic discipline of
history, historical literature, and the writing of history.

>>

>> **By the end of this course, you should be able to:** 1) Describe what
history is and what historians do; 2) Consider texts critically: both what was
written in the past and what has been written about the past; 3) Construct a
persuasive argument based on evidence.  
>  All of these skills are of great use after college.

**Class time:** Class time will usually be discussion, but from time to time I
will lecture briefly to provide background information. We will normally
discuss issues brought up by course readings, helping you to develop skills of
analysis, critical thinking, and clear speaking. In discussion, you and I work
together to meet course objectives:

> > **You should expect to:** Come to class, read assignments before class,
prepare for class using discussion question handouts (see  "Discussion
Questions" below), and contribute to group discussion (see "Participation"
below).

>>

>> **I promise to:** Come to class, read and think carefully about the work
you hand in, write helpful comments on papers, tests, and other assignments,
make discussions as interesting as possible, and answer questions both in and
outside class.

**Discussion Questions:** Questions to assist you in thinking about the
reading assignments will be handed out the class session before the reading is
due. They are also available on the website
([www.uiowa.edu/~c016012e/question.html](question.html)) if you miss class.
These will also be used to frame class discussion. You should write down your
answers on the sheet and bring them to class. Also write down other questions
and comments you may have about the reading--my questions are not necessarily
all we will talk about in class.

**Texts:** The books to be used for the term are:

> > Strunk and White, The Elements of Style, 4th ed.  
>  Natalie Zemon Davis, The Return of Martin Guerre  
>  Course Reader - Available at Zephyr Copies, 124 East Washington St.  
>  Steven Hoch, Serfdom and Social Control In Russia  
>  John Mack Faragher, Sugar Creek: Life on the Illinois Prairie

All books except the course reader are available at Iowa Book and Supply, 8
South Clinton Street, Iowa City. The course reader is only available at
Zephyr. For books used later in the term, you may want to investigate internet
book services, including
[**half.com**](http://www.half.com/products/books/index.cfm) for used books
and
[**dealtime.com**](http://www.dealtime.com/dealtime2000/Pages/Media_MainPage/1,5375,36718-63715-1-books,00.html?Link_id=5-48183)
for new books. Each will also be put on reserve at the library.

In addition, there will be some readings available on the internet. You should
probably print these out so that you can mark them up and bring them to class.
They are marked (Web) in the course schedule.

**Grading:** You will be graded on: 1) Your knowledge of history from class
activities and texts. 2) Your ability to think critically, to speak and write
clearly, and to construct an argument based on evidence.

**Breakdown:**

Attendance and Class Participation 20%  
Paper 1 (2-3 pages - due Week 3) 10%  
Paper 2 (5-6 pages - due Week 5) 15%  
Exam 1 (Week 8) 10%  
Presentation Preview (1-2 pages - due Week 12)

I grade with pluses and minuses, and I do not grade on a curve.

**Participation:** Because discussion in class is a cooperative effort among
all of us, twenty percent of your grade is based on your participation. Half
of this grade is based on attendance, the other half on contributions to class
discussions. This includes occasional in-class assignments such as quizzes or
other writing assignments.  
  
**Attendance:** Absences are excused if you notify me before class that you
will not be in class. This can be done by talking to me, calling me, sending
me email (I will check my email shortly before class starts), or leaving me a
note in the History Department office. This is a matter of courtesy to me.
Absences after class will be excused if I receive a note from the Athletic
Department for university sports-related events, or from a physician or nurse
for illnesses.

An excused absence means that you will receive points for attendance, but not
for participation.

**[Assignments:](assign.html) ** More information will be provided for each
assignment well before it is due.

> **Paper 1** will be a 2-3 page paper based on Davis.  
>  **Paper 2** will be a 4-5 page paper based on Davis and the other readings
about Martin Guerre.  
>  **Exam 1** will be over the first eight weeks of the course on rural
communities in Europe, and our discussion of history and community. It will
also have questions about Hoch. There will be short answer and essay
questions.  
>  **Exam 2** will be over the second six weeks of the course on rural
communities in the United States. It will also have questions about Faragher.
There will be short answer and essay questions.  
>  **In-class Presentation** will be a brief (no more than 10 minutes) talk to
the class about the communities in which you grew up. You will use the
knowledge gained from class to evaluate the nature and characteristics of
those communities.  
>  **Presentation Preview** will be a 1-2 page paper about what you expect to
talk about in your in-class presentation.

Late assignments will be penalized one letter grade for each day they are
late.

**[History Writing Center](http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Ehistwrit/):** The History
Department has a writing center to assist you in writing papers for History
courses. It is staffed with History graduate students who will help you think
about writing or critique a draft of a paper. It is located in 303 Schaeffer
Hall. Hours of service will be posted on the office door, or you may call to
make an appointment at 335-2584.

**Plagiarism / Cheating:** Any student who plagiarizes or cheats on any
assignment faces penalties which may include an F on the assignment or an F in
the course. If I suspect plagiarism or cheating, I am required to inform you
in writing and to give you a copy of the report on the incident that I submit
to the History Department and to the College of Liberal Arts.

**Students with Disabilities:** I would like to hear from anyone who has a
disability which may require some modification of seating, testing, or other
class requirements so that appropriate arrangements may be made. Please talk
with me after class or during my office hours.

**Questions / Problems:** Please visit me during my office hours (or other
times by appointment) to discuss your work or anything concerning the course.
If you feel that we have not resolved the issue, you should talk to Professor
Henry Horwitz, the Issues Coordinator. His office is 119 Schaeffer Hall and
his telephone number is 335-2288. You may also contact the Chair of the
History Department, Professor Ken Cmiel. His office is 280 Schaeffer Hall, and
his telephone number is 335-2299.

**Schedule:** Each assignment should be read **before** the date listed. You
should bring the discussion questions for the day with you to class and come
prepared to discuss.

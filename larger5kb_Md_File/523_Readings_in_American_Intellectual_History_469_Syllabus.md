This course is designed to provide you with a comprehensive look at the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, with particular emphasis on the
impact which Charles Darwin and his ideas made upon American thought and
culture. To achieve this objective, you will read the works of nineteenth- and
twentieth-century authors and will be graded each class period on your ability
to discuss and synthesize the topics studied. Additional course objectives
include written and oral communicative skills development, logical and
critical thinking, an understanding of varying discipline methodologies, and
the ability to synthesize ideas.

The principles upon which this course are based include the following: (1)
knowledge is acquired only through thinking; (2) you can learn what to think
only as you learn how to think; (3) to become educated is to learn how to
gather, analyze, synthesize, assess, and apply information for oneself; (4)
discussion, focused on issues, is a better sign of learning than silent
students passively accepting what the instructor says; (5) you gain
significant knowledge only if you value it; (6) information should be
presented so as to be understandable from the point of view of the learner;
(7) you learn best by working with other students in settings that generate
mutually supportive debate and empathic exchange of ideas; (8) you need
intellectual standards to assess your thinking and the thinking of others; and
(9) you should expect continuous feedback from the instructor on the quality
of your work.

**Presentation/Critique of Books**

During each class period, you will be expected to discuss and critique
assigned books. This will require you to have read the assignment prior to
class and be able to explain the nature, purpose, and content of the book, its
relation to the topic under discussion, and other pertinent factors beneficial
to fellow students in the class. A one-page synopsis of each book or article
you read will be turned in to the instructor on the day you discuss the book.
The instructor will provide written comments for each of your assignments.

Since you will be graded each class period, and since no other student will be
reporting on your book or article, your absence will affect the outcome of the
specific topic being discussed. Therefore, absences are discouraged, and three
or more absences will affect the final grade.

  
**Research Paper**

The research paper of no more than fifteen pages is required in the seminar.
You will be asked to investigate in depth a topic of particular interest to
you. Please consult with instructor as you formulate your ideas. Be sure to
select a topic that is manageable and focused. Papers will be read critically.
State the purpose of the paper at the outset--what are you trying to show? Do
not present a superificial survey of some medical discipline as your topic;
this is too general and serves no useful purpose. Ask yourself an historical
question at the outset, provide evidence for your answers, and draw
conclusions from your sources. Weigh your sources. Are they correct in what
they say? Look for biases in the sources and use them judiciously. Be sure to
look at both primary and secondary sources. Put the paper in historical
context. Do not present a simple compilation of facts unassociated with the
setting in which they occurred. Explain the facts. History is not just a
chronology of events. Be sure to use journals and magazine articles as well as
books in your research. Immerse yourself in the readings on your topic before
doing any writing. The library staff, reference books, and computer assisted
data searches are to be used. Do not skip them in your research. They are
essential to a good paper. Students are required to submit to the instructor
their drafts of the research paper as it progresses in order to receive timely
feedback and direction. The student's final submission shall include all notes
as well as drafts.

In choosing a topic, students should ask themselves the following questions:

1\. Is the question-at-issue (thesis) well stated? Is it clear and unbiased?
Does the thesis do justice to the complexity of the matter at issue?  
2\. Does the writer cite relevant evidence and information essential to the
issue?  
3\. Does the writer clarify key concepts when necessary?  
4\. Does the writer show a sensitivity to what he or she is assuming or taking
for granted (insofar as those assumptions might reasonably be questioned)?  
5\. Does the writer develop a definite line of reasoning, explaining well how
he or she is arriving at his or her conclusions?  
6\. Is the writer's reasoning well supported?  
7\. Does the writer show a sensitivity to alternative points of view or lines
of reasoning? Does he or she consider and respond to the objections framed
from other points of view?  
8\. Does the writer show a sensitivity to the implications and consequences of
the position he or she has taken?

Rules for Writing Research Papers:

1\. Keep paper in past tense.  
2\. Avoid passive voice.  
3\. No paragraphs of less than four sentences.  
4\. Provide abstract at beginning of paper.  
5\. Do not use indented quotes.  
6\. Quoted material should not extend more than four lines.  
7\. Do not use chapter titles.  
8\. Seven-word limit on title of research paper.  
9\. No more than 10 pages, not counting title page, footnotes, and
bibliography.  
10\. Identify all individuals mentioned in paper.

  
Research Talk

At the conclusion of the course, you will be allotted a short block of time in
which to present the results of your research. Use it well. You will not read
your paper to us. Instead, you will be expected to distill from it the
essential points and tell them to the class. Begin your talk with some remarks
about the purpose of your research. End up with your conclusions. Be as clear
and concise as possible. Questions from fellow classmates are expected.

**New Faculty Network  
** Tuesdays, April 9, April 30, and May 21  
8:30 - 10:00 am  
300 Younkin Success Center  
Facilitated by Kathryn Plank, FTAD

What did you learn during your first year of teaching at Ohio State? How was
it different from what you expected? What are your plans for next year? If you
are new-or almost new-faculty at Ohio State, join us for some relaxed morning
conversation with your peers. This series has been designed to give new
faculty the opportunity to exchange experiences and discuss strategies for
success. Although a general topic has been selected for each meeting,
participants may suggest others. All new faculty are welcome to attend any
session or the whole series as desired.

**Teachers' Round Table**  
Fridays, April 12 and May 10  
11:30 am - 1:00 pm (brown bag optional)  
300 Younkin Success Center  
Coordinated by Kathryn Plank, FTAD; and Kenneth Jones, Anatomy and Medical
Education

The Teachers' Round Table (TRT) is a discussion forum for Ohio State faculty
and TAs who are interested in improving teaching and enhancing learning. We
have scheduled two sessions for spring quarter. Please join us to share your
experiences and explore new ideas. We also invite you to join our TRT
listserv, which will provide an opportunity both for participants to continue
the conversation after the event and for those who were unable to attend to
join in the discussion.

**April 12 Preventing Internet Plagiarism**

The Internet can make it easier for students to do research. Unfortunately, it
also makes it easier for them to plagiarize, whether intentionally (e.g.,
purchasing papers on-line) or unintentionally (e.g., failing to give
appropriate attribution). In this session, Nancy O'Hanlon and Karen Diaz from
Library User Education will join us to explore the problem and its causes.
We'll also discuss strategies for preventing plagiarism and, when all else
fails, for detecting it after it has occurred.

**May 10 Teaching Large Classes**

How do you actively involve students in the class when it is impossible even
to know all of their names? How do you provide feedback on learning when
simply collecting homework is a major strategic operation? Teaching large
classes introduces a unique, and sometimes overwhelming, set of challenges in
addition to the everyday challenges of teaching. Fortunately, many who teach
large classes at Ohio State have developed effective strategies for overcoming
these obstacles and engaging students in learning. We invite you to join us in
this discussion to ask questions, share successes, and learn from each other.
We also hope to capture your ideas in a resource guide that will be made
available to others.

**Women in Higher Education: Expectations, Communication, and Negotiation**  
Wednesday, April 17  
3:30 - 5:00 pm  
300 Younkin Success Center  
Presented by Judy Fountain, The Women's Place; and Kathryn Plank, FTAD

Recent research on gender in the workplace describes a "shadow negotiation"
that lies beneath the surface of any negotiation. Here, hidden assumptions,
unspoken attitudes, interpersonal communication, and conflicting agendas form
a parallel conversation in which gender plays an important role. In this
session, we will discuss possible implications of this research for women as
teachers and as scholars, and we will explore strategies for managing the
negotiation process in academic life.

Co-sponsored by the Academy of Teaching and FTAD

* How can faculty effectively document their teaching?  
* How can a department develop a fair and complete system of evaluating teaching?  
* How can we use student feedback to change our teaching practices?

The Ohio State University Academy of Teaching is hosting this mini-conference:
four sessions that will highlight different aspects of the evaluation of
teaching in the university. Presenters in each session are invited guests from
the university community who will share their experiences and perspectives on
the topic. Faculty and administrators have an opportunity to learn about
efforts around the university to effectively evaluate teaching as well as
engage in discussions around these issues. Each of the four sessions will be
presented twice, to allow greater choice for participants.

Presented by The Ohio State Partnership Grant and its affiliates (Office for
Disability Services, FTAD, Technology Enhanced Learning and Research, The

Ohio State is the origination site for this national teleconference, an effort
to share cost-effective and meaningful strategies for improving collaboration
among administrators, faculty, staff, and students on diversity and disability
issues. These strategies revolve around the teaching-learning process, the
provision of accommodations, and the fostering of institutional commitment to
greater access and disability awareness.

The objectives of this presentation are:  
*To share strategies for gaining and maintaining administrative support for including students with disabilities in the higher education community.  
*To clarify roles and responsibilities of faculty, students, and disability service providers so that faculty gain the skills and supports needed to deliver a quality education.  
*To demonstrate climate assessment and strategic action planning techniques as replicable efforts which other institutions can use to foster administrative support and increase communication among faculty, students, and other campus resources on disability issues.

**Does Race Matter? Exploring the Racial Dynamics at Ohio State**  
Wednesday, May 1  
2:00 - 4:00 pm  
150 Younkin Success Center  
Presented by Natasha Philpot, Mark Skillings, and Dwight L. Varnum, FTAD

This forum will explore how issues of race and ethnicity influence how
students perceive the academic and social climate at Ohio State. The
interactive discussion will pose questions to a panel made up of students,
TAs, faculty, and administrators that will address key issues such as:

* How do issues of race and ethnicity impact the learning climate at Ohio State?  
* Has Ohio State appropriately addressed issues of race and ethnicity on campus?  
* Do racial issues impact the reputation of Ohio State?  
* How can Ohio State support students of color and other underrepresented students?  
* What can Ohio State do to ensure that the learning and social environments are welcoming to everyone?

This session is designed to allow both undergraduate and graduate students to
have a voice in the diversity dialogue on campus and seeks to better
understand the racial dynamics that exist.

**Responding to Student Writing**  
Friday, May 3  
11:30 am - 1:00 pm  
300 Younkin Success Center  
Co-sponsored by the Center for the Study and Teaching of Writing, ESL
Composition Program, and FTAD

* What concerns do Ohio State students bring to writing assignments?  
* What additional concerns do ESL students have that native speakers do not?  
* What are effective strategies for teaching writing to linguistically diverse students?  
* What are effective strategies for responding to writing?

Writing consultants will facilitate a discussion concerning the role of
instructors in creating the opportunities for all students to develop as
writers. Workshop participants will work collaboratively in small groups to
develop efficient and effective response strategies for meeting the needs of
linguistically diverse undergraduate and graduate students.

**Planning Ahead for an Academic Job Search**  
Thursday, May 16  
3:30 - 5:00 pm  
300 Younkin Success Center  
Presented by Stephanie Rohdieck, FTAD

Thinking about applying for faculty positions? Don't know where to begin? Join
us for a discussion about the first steps in this process. We will talk about
what you can do right now to prepare yourself, as well as what information you
could be collecting and organizing that will help you document and present
your teaching effectiveness in the job search process. This workshop is
appropriate for TAs who plan to go on the job market soon and have not yet
attended a previous FTAD workshop on this topic. In the fall, we will offer a
series of follow-up workshops on constructing a personal philosophy of
teaching statement, assembling a teaching portfolio, writing about teaching in
your CV and cover letter, and the academic job interview process.

**Planning for Autumn Courses and Creating Your Syllabus**  
  
FTAD staff will convene a session on course design and syllabus construction
near the end of summer, if we have enough interest. If you are creating a new
course for autumn or are considering a major revision, you should sign up for
this interactive workshop. Participants will learn about important principles
of course planning, will give and receive feedback on drafts of course plans,
and will have time to begin revisions based on the session.

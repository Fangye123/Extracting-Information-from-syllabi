### Presentation

Your presentations will be held during the last two weeks of class. You should
plan on approximately 15 minutes for your talk. It is possible that the last
talk one day may have to get pushed to the next class period, so please plan
for that possibility. You may select from among the topics below, or choose
your own topic. Either way, please email me your selection so that I can add
it to the page. Soonafter you select the topic (and well before your talk is
scheduled) you should then email me with the source or sources (papers, web
page, etc.) that you will base your talk on. I must approve this before you
can proceed with your talk. As your requests come in, I will add them to this
page, first come first served. Two students may decide to do the same topic,
but if you do, you must coordinate with one another before your talk (I will
let you know if you've picked the same topic as someone, if it's not reflected
on this page already), and each of you must address a different aspect of the
topic in your own 15 minute talk (which I'll probably schedule back-to-back).

So, in your email to me, by this **Friday, April 26th** , send the following:

* Topic 
* Preferred Date 
* 2nd Choice Date 
* Willing to split the topic if I think it can be done for this particular topic? 
* Someone else in mind to work on the other "half" of the topic? 
* 2nd Choice of Topic (optional) 

Fifteen minutes is NOT a long time. You will be expected to read and
understand much more than you can tell us about. This presentation will test
your ability to digest the most important aspects of the material you read,
and present it in a way that we can understand. Expect me (or others) to ask
one or more questions that go beyond what you cover in the class.

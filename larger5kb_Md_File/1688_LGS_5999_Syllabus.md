#### Materials:

Martin Shapiro, _Courts: A Comparative and Political Analysis_ (Univ. of
Chicago Press, 1981).

Additional materials listed, to be handed out or placed on reserve.

Supplementary materials (case excerpts or short commentaries) as may be handed
out and assigned from time to time.

#### Seminar Description and Objectives:

This seminar examines in detail the concept of "the rule of law," drawing on
judicial decisions and on materials from a range of academic disciplines,
including political science, history, and philosophy. The purpose is to
explore ways in which law serves both to legitimate and to restrain the
exercise of public power.

This seminar has been developed primarily for students pursuing the
undergraduate Minor in Legal Studies. It assumes that students will already
have completed either Legal Studies 201 or some other law-related coursework.

We will begin by posing the question of whether "the rule of law" is, as some
have asserted, "an unqualified human good," or merely a device to obfuscate
predatory exercises of power. With this question in mind, we will examine the
"Watergate" constitutional crisis of 1972-74, as well as the "Iran-Contra"
crisis of 1986-87. Next, we will undertake a close reading of Martin Shapiro's
landmark study of the historical role of courts as tools of governance. We
will conclude the first half of the semester by contrasting the rule-of-law
ideal with uses (or abuses) of law in totalitarian states (Nazi Germany and
the Soviet Union).

In the second half of the course, we will focus on ethical dilemmas posed by
the rule-of-law ideal. We will consider what constitutes the proper role of
judges in a democratic society. We will sample John Noonan's studies of evil
behavior hidden behind the "mask" of the law (in the context of American
slavery). We will assess Paul Butler's provocative argument that jurors should
"nullify" the criminal law where it has a disparate impact on African-
Americans. We will evaluate the consequences for democracy of the judicial
power to strike down popularly-supported, but "unconstitutional," legislation.
Finally, we will examine the phenomenon of "emergency rule," both here and
abroad, and consider how judges ought to respond to circumstances in which
"the law" itself compels or licenses deprivation of individual rights.

To the maximum extent possible, the seminar will emphasize student
participation. Students will be asked to lead discussion of portions of the
readings, and those who do not volunteer to participate in discussions can
expect to be prompted to do so. Consistent attendance and preparedness are
essential if this seminar is to fulfill its potential as a learning
experience.

#### Course Requirements:

The grade in this course will be based on:

1\. A 3-5 page paper, based on the reading materials, on a topic to be
assigned at the end of Week 3 (1/28/99), due at the beginning of Week 5
(2/9/99), worth 10% of the grade.

2\. An in-class mid-term examination at the end of Week 8 (3/4/99), worth 20%
of the grade.

3\. A 10-12 page research paper, on a topic to be developed by the student in
consultation with the instructor and _**outlined no later than the end of Week
10 (3/25/99)**_ , due at the beginning of Week 12 (4/8/99), worth 30% of the
grade. During the final two weeks of the semester, each student will give a
short presentation to the class on his or her paper topic.

4\. A cumulative final examination, as scheduled during the examination
period, worth 25% of the grade.

5\. Class participation, worth 15% of the grade.

#### Relevant Office Information:

My Political Science Dept. Office: F/AB 2055, 577-6335

Legal Studies Office (Debra Viles): 3081 F/AB, 577-3947

I will be holding office hours on Thursdays, 1:30-2:30 and 6:10-7:10 P.M., in
my Political Science office. I am also available by appointment almost any
day. In addition to being available to answer questions on topics covered in
the course, I am eager to get to know each of you, to confer about your
academic or career plans, and to discuss any legal issues that you find of
interest. Do not be shy about coming by.

#### Class Policies:

* Class attendance is mandatory. More than four (4) unexcused absences will result in a penalty of one full letter grade. Habitual lateness will also be penalized. 

* Students will be expected to come to class prepared either to answer questions about the readings or to raise questions about what they did not understand. 

* Students are expected at all times to be respectful of their instructor and of one another. This entails, among other things, arriving to class on time, avoiding behavior that tends to distract attention, and maintaining civility when expressing disagreement.

* Papers shall be typed, double-spaced, with reasonable letter size and margins.

* Papers will be graded on content, organization, presentation style (e.g., paragraph structure, grammar, spelling), and proper use of citations (where applicable). Examinations will be graded mainly on content, but significant deficits in other aspects will count against the grade.

* Late papers will be subject to a penalty of one full letter grade, except where extraordinary circumstances can be demonstrated. 

* No make-up exams will be scheduled without good cause, such as credible evidence of illness or family emergency.

* Students failing to complete all required work by the end of the term will receive a grade of E; no grade of I (Incomplete) will be granted except where extraordinary circumstances can be demonstrated.

* Cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty or misconduct are prohibited and will not be tolerated. Students who are uncertain as to whether contemplated conduct constitutes a violation are responsible for raising the question in advance. No question is a stupid question, but an effort to sneak something by will be treated harshly. Incidents will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Student Due Process Statute, copies of which may be obtained by the student from Student Support Services, Room 470, Student Center Building.

* Students are responsible for knowledge of and compliance with University policies, as set forth in the University _Bulletin_.

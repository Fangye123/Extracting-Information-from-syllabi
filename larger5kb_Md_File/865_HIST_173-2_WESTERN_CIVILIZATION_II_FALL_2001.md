Prof. Richard Saunders -- 200-A Holtzendorff (The "Y")   656-5373

If I am delayed to class, please have the courtesy to wait 10 min, or until
someone from the department instructs you.

A good course has a good syllabus, and sets the expectations and the rules
down clearly at the start. This syllabus is meant to be a helpful document,
especially the BIG POINT that is included with each day's subject. If it seems
a little harsh, it is only to get everything squarely on the rails so that the
course will be fulfilling for you and go smoothly for all of us.

TO CONTACT ME:  
    My office hours are all day Tuesdays except for lunch at 11:30, and Thursday mornings 9:15-11:30. These are generous office hours and should accommodate most people. There is no need for an appointment during those hours. If you have a special problem, I can usually manage a short appointment at other times if you ask. I am a pretty easy guy to talk to so long as you are not whining about grades. If you want to be more than a seat number, it is a good idea to stop buy sometime during the semester.   
    Call me if you need to talk--653-5373. Home number is 654-2841. Please no calls during the evening news 6:30-7:30. E-mail is airedal@clemson.edu, but it is a poor way to contact me as I don't read it very often. Do not expect quick responses on e-mail. I just don't like students who don't have the guts to call or show up in person.

READING:  
TEXT:  Judith Coffin, Robert Stacey et al. _Western Civilizations; Their
History and Their Culture_. VOL 2. (W.W. Norton)

FOR YOUR REPORT: Adam Hochschild. _King Leopold's Ghost; A Story of Greed,
Terror and Heroism in Colonial Africa_ (Houghton Miflin)  


REQUIREMENTS:

1\. Complete the book report/paper described below.  
2\. Take both hour examinations and pass the final examination.  
3\. Satisfy the attendance requirement, described below.  


EXAMINATIONS:  
    There will be two "hour" examinations and a final. Dates are in the syllabus. The final is required of everyone. Examinations are essays. They are designed to test two things, knowledge and understanding. KNOWLEDGE is the factual information you have at your command, basically a function of the work you put into the course. UNDERSTANDING is a much trickier matter that includes the ability to draw logical conclusions from the information. This is more a function of talent than of work. Logical conclusions are not the same thing as opinions.   
    Grading your essays involves judgment. Some judgments are easy--essays that are truly excellent or truly awful don't require much agonizing on my part. Essays that are borderline between letter grades are more difficult. You will be writing a total of eight essays in this course, seven on exams and one big one for an outside paper, and an average of the judgments on those nine exercises is as close to a fair evaluation of your work as we can get.

GRADES:  
    To guide you in the weight put on various exercises, the hour examinations count around 20% each, the paper around 20% each and the final 40%. 40% means it is possible to pull your grade up on the final by a letter or two, but it is also possible to sink a letter or two if you blow it.   
 However, your final grade is a matter of judgment, not a mathematical
computation of "points." This is meant to give hope to students who master the
work by the end of the course even if they stumbled along the way. The
decision between one of two letter grades for a final grade will rest on a
careful re-reading of the last (comprehensive) essay on your final exam. A
quality performance on this essay that shows an understanding of the course
(as opposed to simply memorizing a lot of stuff) is mandatory for an A. Some B
or even high C averages may turn into a final grade of A because of a quality
performance on this essay, and some A averages going into the final may not
translate into a final grade of A if performance on this essay does not
demonstrate an understanding of the course. If you pass the final, you will
pass the course provided all requirements listed above have been met. A clear
(not borderline) failure on the final is very serious and will probably mean
an F in the course regardless of your average before the final.  
    
ATTENDANCE:  
    This is a lecture course. There is no substitute for being present and thinking, for 50 minutes, about the subject at hand. Every single day contains material that is part of the understanding you must demonstrate at the end of the course. Getting notes from a friend can plug a few holes but not much more. If you cut more than three times without a credible excuse, you should assume you will not get the benefit of the doubt in close calls for a final grade and in any event, can forget about an A.   
    However, there are no specific penalties for up to six cuts. Whatever subject matter and announcements you miss are your responsibility. These cuts are meant for university activities (including athletics), illness, family emergencies, job interviews, or whatever--it is your business. There is no distinction between "excused" or any other absences. If you take cuts for frivolous reasons and then get sick, that's too bad. A full letter grade will be deducted for anyone with more than 6 cuts, and more than 10 cuts, an F is automatic. A wise person will save a cut or two in case the flu strikes or an uncle dies late in the semester, or in case you come in late and get counted absent. An F means wasted money, wasted time, a bad GPR, and tee'd off parents.   
    In very rare cases such as a hospitalized illness late in the semester, you may plead for special consideration. You must present evidence of your special situation, along with an explanation for ALL your cuts during the semester. I will be the judge on whether to accept your special pleading or not. But it is only fair for me to tell you I have no respect for students who cut class. I seldom buy their excuses. Harsh penalties for cutters leaves me room to give higher grades to students who did their job and came to class.   


CLASSROOM MANNERS:  
     In this class, we are sardines squeezed in a very small space. Behavior that would be tolerable in small groups becomes intolerable in this large group.   
    
1) Talking in class.  Yakking annoys the students around you who are trying to
listen. It annoys the friend you are yakking at, especially if that friend has
dreams of passing. It annoys the professor and he controls your final grade.
'Nuff said.

  2) Coming late--AND THIS RELATES TO ATTENDANCE, SO YOU BETTER READ IT.
Straggling in late means you missed a lot of stuff. Important things often
come at the start. Coming in late is a problem for others, not just you. It
disrupts my train of thought, disrupts other students' train of thought, and
is very, very annoying. The assistants will begin taking attendance shortly
after the class begins. There is some leeway. We are not SOBs about this.
Sometimes they will start at the back and sometimes at the front. If you are
not in your seat when their scan comes your way, you are counted absent, and
the absence penalties prescribed above apply. So you may slide by a late
arrival with no penalty, or you may not. **To be clear, if you are not in your
seat when attendance is taken, you are absent and that is that. I will believe
the word of my assistants every time on this matter. If you complain to me
that it was unfair of the assistants to count you absent when you only missed
by a teeny weeny little bit, the fact is you were late by at least ten minutes
and now you have labeled yourself a whiner and can forget any break on
grades.**

  3) Leaving early. Is not polite, unless you come down with a fit of coughing
or are about to hurl. IF YOU DO IT, YOU BETTER EXPLAIN TO THE PROFESSOR, FACE-
TO-FACE, NOT THE ASSISTANTS, WHY YOU DID IT.

  4) Sleeping in class. If you sleep in class, there is no point coming at
all. If it is because of a job, you clearly cannot handle the job and school
at the same time. If it is because you are a party animal, it is time to grow
up. If your sleeping annoys me enough, I will tell the assistants to mark you
absent, and that is that.

  5) Cell phones. If you use one in class, I will drop you. One flick at the
computer and you're out. Money wasted, parents tee'd, three hours of W on your
record. Leave your cell phones at home. You are warned.  
    
ESSAY:  
    This assignment takes the place of two 5 pp book reports assigned in previous semesters. It is an important exercise in thinking about and writing about history and how we make sense out of it, free of the time constraints of regular exams. You should take it seriously.   
    You will write one big essay/book report outside of class. You will need to read Chapter 25 in your text carefully, and the Hochschild book, King Leopold's Ghost. You will not be ready to write this paper until after we have discussed imperialism in class. Here are your instructions, and these are all the instructions you will get.   
    Based on your text, lecture material and most of all, King Leopold's Ghost, write a paper, a minimum of eight pages (double-spaced, 12 point type), on the question WHAT DID THE NEW (19TH CENTURY) IMPERIALISM ILLUMINATE ABOUT WESTERN CIVILIZATION?   
    
1) First and foremost, this will be a book report on King Leopold's Ghost.
Read the book and write a paper on what it is about. This need not be a book
"review" in which you put the book in context with other works on the subject
and evaluate its worth. Indeed, you are not prepared to write a book review,
so don't try, or to put it another way, leave your personal opinions of the
book out.

 2) But I want more than just a book report. I want you to compare what
happened in the Congo Free State to imperial adventures by countries other
than Belgium in Asia and other parts of Africa, so that you can reach a more
general conclusion on the question posed: What did the New Imperialism
Illuminate about Western Civilization? For the word "illuminate" you can
substitute the words "show," "demonstrate," or "illustrate" if they make more
sense to you. The decision on what specifically you should talk about is up to
you and is part of this exercise. Do not come to me in a helpless, clueless
little voice with the question "I don't know what you want."

 3) You are to use your textbook, lecture notes and King Leopold's Ghost. Keep
quotations to a minimum. They detract more than they add. I cannot stop you
from consulting other sources, but if you use them, you must cite them
properly, including Internet sources. Beware of the Internet; it is often
described as this great resource, but in fact a lot of what is on it is quite
hollow and usually makes for a high-schoolish looking paper. The assistants
and I, who will be grading your papers, know our way around the Internet, so
do not copy things off it without attribution. You are warned. I will turn you
right over to Academic Dishonesty and your fate is in their hands.

     Papers are due at class time on Nov. 1, the day before Fall Break. If they are late, they will be docked a letter grade. Papers submitted to me electronically before the deadline will be counted on time ONLY if a hard copy is submitted within 24 hours. I do not read electronic papers, and if there is no hard copy, there will be no credit. Papers turned in after papers have been turned back to the rest of the class will be docked two letter grades.  **No papers will be accepted after NOON on Friday, December 6, the last day of class. NO EXCEPTION. This exercise is worth 20% of your final grade but failure to turn it in at all will mean an automatic F. This is a serious penalty. Students are always stunned that they blew a chance for a good grade, or even a passing grade, because of a lousy paper that for at least a half-baked job, would have taken no more than an evening. The paper should not be blown off.** ****

 ABOUT THE COURSE

    This course, the second half of Western Civ, is about the knowledge-based civilization that developed in Europe after the 16th century. As the course begins, European civilization was only one of several civilizations in the world and not necessarily the most advanced. But as Europe substituted knowledge for authority as the foundation of its culture, it grew so powerful and so rich that by the 19th century, it either spread to or conquered the rest of the world. As this professor conceives the course, the United States is an integral part of this civilization, a product of the 18th century Enlightenment ideals that are central to the course, and quickly playing a larger and larger role as the importance of technology, resources and wealth took hold.   
    The methods, values and assumptions of this western civilization are the methods and values that, for better or for worse, run the world of today and set the parameters in which all of us live. That is why an understanding of this civilization is important to everyone. This is true no matter whether your personal heritage is derived from Europe or not, and no matter whether your personal spiritual beliefs make you uncomfortable with, even angry over, key assumptions of this civilization.   
    The course ends, except to clear the decks, with the end of the Second World War. The nations of Europe that were the main focus of the course lay in ruins. Europe's importance in the world recedes in the rear view mirror. New players come to the fore--the United States, Russia (then the Soviet Union), the Asian civilizations of Japan and China, and new nations that emerge from the old colonial empires. India, Pakistan, Ghana and Indonesia were the first of these. HIST 391, The World Since World War II, is the course that picks up where this one leaves off.

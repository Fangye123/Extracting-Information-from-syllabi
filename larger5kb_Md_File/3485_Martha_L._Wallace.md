##  Biographical Note

|  Here is what the college news service says about me:  
_Martha Wallace, a 1975 St. Olaf graduate, earned M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in
mathematics education from the University of Minnesota. She spent several
years teaching secondary school mathematics before returning to St. Olaf,
where she is in charge of the mathematics education program. She recently
completed a two-year term as president of the Minnesota Council of Teachers of
Mathematics and regularly serves on several state and national committees
dealing with mathematics education._

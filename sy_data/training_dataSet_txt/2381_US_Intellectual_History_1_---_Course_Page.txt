COURSE REQUIREMENTS
Read these requirements closely, because they tell you all you need
to know about the operation of the class and the requirements for your
paper.  Don't read these once and then forget them, because you'll
be judged on the basis of them.
ATTENDANCE: I only take attendance on Fridays, partly to get
to know students' names, and partly to make sure people give sufficient
importance to this part of the course.  Part of your discussion grade
is also a grade for attendance -which means showing up for lecture on time. 
If you happen to be late for lecture once during the semester, I'll overlook
it.  If you're someone who makes a habit of walking in after I begin
lecturing then you'll feel the impact quite significantly in your semester
grade.
READING: All students must complete the reading for the course. 
(Note that several of the books are heavily abridged and are much shorter
than they appear).  Weekly assignments are indicated in the syllabus. 
It is very important for you to complete the reading in time for the Friday
discussion.
DISCUSSIONS: On Fridays, class will be devoted to a discussion
of the issues raised in lectures and in the reading.  You will not
be able to do well in the discussions if you haven't kept up with your
reading.  It is expected that you will have finished the week's reading
assignment by the time of the Friday discussion.  As much as possible,
the discussions will be a friendly exchange of ideas and opinions. 
The discussions are intended to be fun and enriching, not threatening. 
Don't feel intimidated by a lack of background in history; often there
is no one "right" answer to the questions being discussed, and undergraduates
always do as well as graduate students in these sessions.  Part
of your grade for the semester will be based on your active participation
(talking) in the discussions, so it is important to show up and take part. 
Their purpose is to give you practice speaking about and challenging ideas,
instead of just memorizing them.
PAPERS: For undergraduates, there will be one paper, 8 pages
long, DUE IN CLASS ON MONDAY NOV 26.  All papers must be double-spaced,
and type-written or printed by computer.  Handwritten papers will
not be accepted.  Papers should be stapled together; please do not
use paper or plastic folders to bind them.  Papers should be submitted
with a separate title page on the front, with a title, the student's name,
and the name of the course.  Do not put your name inside the paper,
as each will be read with the title page turned back in order to assure
an objective, neutral reading of the essay.  This way your performance
in class discussion should not influence your paper grade.  No paper
extensions, even in the event of a nuclear war.  For every day the
paper is late, it will drop a full grade (for example, from a B+ to a C+). 
These papers are to be "think papers" instead of research papers. 
I want to know your perceptions and ideas.  The papers will be graded
on the strength of their ideas, their ability to advance a thesis or interpretation,
and on how well they are written (their use of language, spelling, punctuation,
and syntax).  Naturally, any plagiarism (having someone write the
paper for you, or copying it from another source) will result in an immediate
failure of the entire course.  Use endnotes to indicate page numbers
for any quotes you use, or to tell the reader when you have borrowed ideas
from another author.
The paper should be written on the following topic: Discuss the ideas
of one of the other authors in relation to Emersonianism.  Choose
one writer or figure (for example, use Winthrop, Franklin, Tocqueville,
Whitman, Douglass, or Lincoln) and indicate the way in which their ideas
either agree with or contradict Emerson's outlook.  Is there a way
in which they partake somewhat in Emersonianism?  Or, conversely,
do they provide a challenge to Emersonianism?  What is Emersonianism,
anyway?
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: Students with disabilities covered
by the Americans with Disabilities Act should follow these steps: 1) Provide
documentation of your disability to the Office of Disabled Student Services
(08 Kellum Hall, 644-9566).  2) Bring a statement from the Office
of Disabled Student Services indicating that you have registered with them
to your instructor the first week of class.  The statement should
indicate the special accommodations you require.
EXAMS: There will be two exams during the course of the semester
-a midterm and a final.  Both of the tests will be a combination of
ten short identifications and one essay question.  As in the papers,
the exams will be judged on the strength of their ideas, their ability
to advance a thesis or interpretation, and their use of language, spelling,
punctuation, and syntax.  Make sure to write legibly enough to be
understood.  Bring blue books for the exam.  Put your name on
the front, but not inside--to insure a neutral reading.
GRADES (FOR UNDERGRADUATES): Each of the four components of the
class will count 25% toward the final grade: the two exams, the paper,
and class discussion.
COURSE WEB SITE: This course has its own page, linked through
my web site at: http://mailer.fsu.edu/~njumonvi . Hey, come to think of
it, you're already here.
OFFICE HOURS:  Fridays 11-12 in Johnston 239.

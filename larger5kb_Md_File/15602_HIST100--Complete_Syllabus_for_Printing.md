**This version of the HIST100, Spring 2000 syllabus is for printing.   All
links and images have been removed, and all pages have been brought together.
By printing this file, you will have the entire syllabus for HIST100:
Introduction to History**.

_**Course Description**_  
History 100 focuses on the methods of historical analysis and the production
of historical works.   Students will investigate the uses of primary and
secondary sources in gathering historical evidence, methods of interpreting
and organizing that information, and the process of historical writing.  To
facilitate this learning process, the class will read three works that serve
as examples of different historical sources, writing styles, and approaches to
history.  The fourth work, _A Short Guide to Writing About History_ , supports
the students' understanding of the historical process and serves as a
supplemental work for this course.

_**Course Requirements**_  
Students are required to take three in-class examinations, investigate and
critique an online historical website, as well, discussing its merit as a tool
for historians, and participate in online and in class discussions.   All
course materials for the site will be available at the HIST100 website, which
include this syllabus, review sheets, and the class discussion board.  This
message board will be used to post daily lecture outlines, raise questions for
discussion and offer students an opportunity to request additional information
about a topics discussed in lecture or about related historical issues.

_**Course Assignments**_

  * **Website Review:**  
For detailed instructions on the website you can view the website review page.
Generally, however, you should understand the purpose of this assignment.
Increasing numbers of today's students access information on the internet,
ranging from the morning sports updates to historical topics such as the
American Civil War.  While this easy access is a great benefit to many of us,
it is important to remember that there is little to guarantee that the
information you find is accurate.  Your job is to select an internet site
relating to the subjects discussed in this class and review it for your
colleagues, judging it's value to students of history.   You will be
addressing questions such as: What kind of information is at the site? What
makes the site worth viewing?  Is it well organized?  Based on what you've
learned in class, is it historically accurate?  For more information on this
assignment, visit the website review assignment page.

  * **Examinations:**  
There will be three examinations in this coursel.  As we near the date of each
exam, students will be given more specifics on the test format.  You will have
the full class period to complete the first two exams and the full time
allotted for the final exam.  
  
Under certain conditions, students may be permitted to make-up missed
examinations. These conditions, however, require validation of the student's
excuse. All make-up examinations will be different in format and content from
that given to the other students. The instructor reserves the right to make
the final judgment on these matters.

#### **Website Review Instructions**

**Website Review:  
** For this course, students will select a history-related website and analyze
its worth as an historical tool.  The internet is a treasure-trove bursting
with historical information, but many sites contain misleading or false
information.  This does not mean they are to be entirely avoided, but it
should serve as a reminder to approach all Internet sites with a skeptical
mind.  In fact, that's a good approach to take to any historical work.
Remember what we discussed on the first day of class:   "Written history is
interpreted history."

Your job with this assignment is to find a site and review it for your
classmates and me.  What can we expect to find when we arrive at this site?
Is it a worthwhile tool or does it offer only cursory information that offers
little to a students who have already taken this or a similar class?  Is it a
terrible site, filled with incorrect information brought on by the author's
bias or ignorance? What makes it terrible?  Or is it outstanding? If so, what
makes it a "must see"?   It's your job to tell us all about the site you
select.

**What is a Review?**  
A website review, like a book review, is a critique of a site on the Internet.
In this case, it's a site dedicated to an historical event, character or
period discussed in this class.

Think of a review in terms of recommending a book or movie to a friend.
You'd do more than tell them that it's "really good," wouldn't you?   You'd
tell them why it's good, beginning with the general plot and some scenes or
chapters that you found particularly interesting.  Then you might add that you
wish the author or producer had gone further into this part of the story, or
skimmed over a less interesting section.  This last critique is essential to
sharing your opinion of the work.  After all, you want to tell your friend why
a particular site is good or bad.  Anyone can summarize, but only after you've
spent time at a site and compared that information with what you learned in
class and through reading, will you be able to offer a truly informed and
worthwhile assessment.

**Questions to Consider:**  
When writing your review, you should answer some of the following questions.
Feel free to come up with others.

  * Who is the expected audience for this site?  Professional Scholars? General Public? College Students? Secondary Schools?

  * What does the site author claim to present at this Internet address?   How successfully does he/she achieve this?

  * Does the site author have an "agenda"?  Is this a political organization? How does the point of view influence the usefulness of the site's material/subject?

  * Is it easy to navigate the site, or did you frequently become lost within its pages and have difficulty returning to particular sections?

  * Does the site contain many images that take too long to download? Does it require a sophisticated equipment to make the collection enjoyable to view or are there only a few large images and frames, allowing a standard system to handle the site effectively?

  * Based on what you've learned in class, is the site historically accurate? Does the author document his/her sources or suggest further reading?

  * Considering your answers to the questions above, would you recommend the site to others? Why or Why not?

For additional discussion of reviews, see your Marius text, _A Short Guide to
Writing About History_ , pp. Appendix A: "Book Reviews," where he offers
suggestions on writing book reviews, which is very similar to the website
review you will be writing.  In addition, I suggest you read Chapter 7:
"Suggestions about Style," which contains wonderful advice to help you improve
your writing style.

Your review should be at least 250 words, though you should not restrict
yourself to that if you wish to write more.  When submitting it to the
discussion list, you **must** offer the site title, full address, it's author
or webmaster, and when the page was last updated.   In addition, you should
include your name, the title of the class and the date submitted. (See example
below)   You may submit your Website Review to the the class discussion list
as early as 21 February 2000, after you have all discussed your selections
with me, or you may wait as late as 14 April 2000.  If you post it after 14
April 2000, it will be considered late and lose 5% points for each day after
the final deadline. (Because you have such a wide submission period, there are
**no** excuses for late papers.)

I'll expect you to read each other's websites as they arrive.  Then, on the
last day of class we'll discuss a few of your favorite and least favorite
sites and why they were selected.  Students should come to class prepared to
talk about their site and others that looked interesting from their
colleagues' reviews.

If you have questions about the assignment, feel free to contact me after
class, during office hours or via email at sus@ksu.edu.  Also, I encourage you
to raise questions with your classmates on the HIST100 discussion list.  See
if they're running into similar problems.  Are you wondering about the
accuracy of a historical claim made on your review website and can't verify it
in the class readings?  Mention this on the discussion list.  Maybe some of
your classmates know the answer.  If not, I'm happy to help and we can all
learn from your research.

Below is a list of sample websites from which you can select a subject for
your review.  You are not restricted to this list, but you should remain
within the subject areas that are central to this course. Yes, you may review
a site that someone else if reviewing, but I expect different reactions.
These are not group projects.  Even if two people like the same site, I'll
expect different assessments in their reviews.

You will need to speak with me when you find a website to review, presenting
the reasons why you think it's worthy of analysis.  You can do this via email,
after class, or during office hours, and you should have the website URL
(address) and its title or subject when we meet or discuss this via email.
Please see the schedule below to see when your deadline for the website
approval.

**Suggested Websites:  
** These are only suggestions. You're welcome to review other sites, but make
sure they relate to the subjects in this class. Suitable sites must contain
more than five pages and be dedicated to the study of the American Revolution,
Women and Urban America in the Early Nineteenth Century, or the ethnic
experience in the American Civil War. If you search for sites at
http://www.yahoo.com or http://altavista.com I suggest that you use the
following search patterns (remember to use quotation marks to focus your
search):  
\--  "American Revolution"  
\--  "Benjamin Franklin"  
\--  "William Franklin"  
\--  "American History" Women (remember to limit your selection to women of
1820-1850 if using this with the _Helen Jewett_ topic or to make sure you're
focusing on ethnic women's experiences in the American Civil War)  
\--   "American History" "Nineteenth Century" "New York City"  
\--  "American Civil War" Irish  
\--  "American Civil War" German  
\--  "American Civil War" African-American  
\--  "American Civil War" "Native American" (or use Indian in place of "Native
America")  
\--  "American Civil War" Ethnic

Theodore Roosevelt Homepage  
http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/index.htm  
The Theodore Roosevelt Association: "Keeping the Spirit Alive"  
Last updated: Not listed

This site, maintained by the Theodore Roosevelt Association, contains five
sub-sites dedicated to different aspects of Roosevelt's life and efforts to
preserve his legacy: Life of Theodore Roosevelt, Theodore Roosevelt
association, TR Research/Resources, Exploring the Living World of Theodore
Roosevelt, and Teddy & the Children's Room.   The sub-sites include further
divisions that lead the visitor to timelines dedicated to Roosevelt's life and
his political career.  The "Life of Theodore Roosevelt" section, the most
informative part of the Theodore Roosevelt Homepage, contains highlights of
his accomplishments as well as a page dedicated to "Myths, Legends and
Trivia." **  ** Other sections of the site include transcripts of Roosevelt
speeches, books, bibliographies of works about Roosevelt, Roosevelt cartoons,
and links to related sites.  The Children's site is dedicated to the history
behind Roosevelt and the "Teddy" bear, and promises to be expanded in the
future.  Exploring the Living World of Theodore Roosevelt contains links to
related museums, archival materials, and historical sites.

The site appears to be developed for the general public and professional
scholars.   Links to online archival materials will be useful to trained
historians and directions to living history programs should appeal to a
Roosevelt buffs.  The site material is clearly organized, each page contains a
direct link to the home page, and large images are limited, easing viewers'
downloading time at the various pages.

Despite these advantages, the viewer may be disappointed with the lack of
update counters at the Theodore Roosevelt Homepage.  Many pages promise that
they are "under construction" with "more coming soon" but there is no
indication when this promise was made.  The reviewer has been  monitoring this
site for approximately two months, and notices little additional development.
Another drawback is the organization sponsoring this site.  The Theodore
Roosevelt Association pledges to provide "authoritative information on the
life and ideals of Theodore Roosevelt," but there is little criticism of
Roosevelt anywhere.    Such a boisterous, opinionated individual was not
without critics, and this should be addressed.  There is little mention of
Roosevelt's 1912 campaign as the Progressive candidate, his disagreement with
President Wilson's policy on the First World War, or his social reforms while
president or during his earlier career in New York City.

Overall, the site is an excellent introduction to one of America's most well-
known presidents.  It should not, however, be the beginning and end of a
viewers research.   By reviewing the online speeches and books, examining some
of the works on the site's recommended reading list, and visiting other
Roosevelt sites that may offer a more balanced approach, the viewer can gain a
better understanding of this famous American.

Listserv Instructions

**  
Listserv:  
** Our class will be participating in an online electronic mail discussion
group, or "list," called HIST100. The list's distribution is managed by
LISTSERV, a common program that handles incoming mail and distributes it to
subscribers to the list. LISTSERV lists are somewhat like print magazines: you
will not receive back issues when you subscribe. The longer you wait to
subscribe to HIST100, the more messages and study ideas you will miss.

**

How it works: **E-mail lists distribute messages from any subscriber to all
the other subscribers. Whenever you direct a message to the list's address,
LISTSERV picks it up and sends it to everyone else subscribed to the list.
They may reply to that message or compose new messages of their own. Your
electronic mailbox will store these messages for you to read. You may use your
e-mail program to erase, print, or continue to store these messages. You can
also tell LISTSERV to send you each day's messages as one large file or
"digest," rather than as separate messages each time the program receives
them. You can customize your subscription with commands that you send as
regular e-mail addresses to the program itself (not to the actual list
address. The program has its own address).  CNS holds regular and frequent
classes on electronic mail. You are urged to attend one of these sessions to
be acquainted with the system and to learn your options.

**

Purpose:** The discussion list should be viewed as a meeting-place for
students to present and discuss issues common to this class and as a
publication site for assignments as required by the instructor. Any HIST100
list subscriber logged on to the mainframe can read messages posted to the
list by students and the instructor. You are encouraged to use the list to
raise issues or questions with the instructor and especially with each other.
You can, for instance, request clarification of points made in lectures, query
the list for potential study partners, arrange extra sessions to prepare for
exams, and either obtain or post study guides, notes, and other texts.
Occasionally, I will raise questions on HIST100 and ask you to respond to
them.   Your participation in these assignments and during open discussions
will comprise 25 points of your final grade.

You may communicate directly and confidentially with me via my electronic mail
address, [sus@ksu.edu](mailto:sus@ksu.edu), instead of the class list.   For
example, DO NOT raise questions regarding grades on HIST100.  Those matters
should be discussed in private during my office hours or on my personal email
account.  I will use the class list to encourage discussion, post study
guides, issue announcements about class sessions or events of interest to
students of history, and to respond to students' requests for information and
guidance.

**

Subscribing:** Subscription to and participation on HIST100 are _required_ in
HIST100. There is no cost to subscribe. Computing  & Network Services (313
Hale Library) provide the service free of charge. Subscription to HIST100 is
_not_ automatic: you must set up your subscription yourself. To subscribe and
sign up:

  1. Get a userid from the campus-computing center (313 Hale). Obtain the CNS guidelines for using PINE, the UNIX electronic mail program, if you plan to use it. You can also discuss with the consultants how to connect to the mainframe from off-campus. Once you have a userid and password, you can subscribe to the list from any campus terminal or by modem from a remote computer. Information about campus terminals, modems, and hardware compatibility at KSU can be obtained from the CNS consultants.  

  2. Contact LISTSERV by sending it an electronic mail message subscribing you to HIST100.   Compose an electronic mail message in PINE, addressed to [LISTSERV@KSU.EDU](mailto:LISTSERV@KSU.EDU), leaving the subject line blank, and having the following commands as the ONLY text of the message:  

> > SUB HIST100 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME

>

> For example: if your name is Jane Jones, the message would read:

>

>> SUB HIST100 Jane Jones

  3. You will receive a confirmation message from LISTSERV after completing this step.   This is to make sure you want to be subscribe to HIST100 and someone isn't subscribing you without your knowledge.  The confirmation message may arrive immediately, it may take several hours, depending on the speed of the mainframe when you're subscribing.  When you receive this, give the command to "Reply" and DO NOT include the original message.  You'll notice a command confirmation number in the subject line of your reply.  Leave this there.  In the message text area, type OK.  If you do not complete these steps within 48 hours of subscribing, you'll have to begin this process again beginning with step 2.  

  4. To send mail directly to the list where all subscribers will read it, [click here](mailto:hist100@ksu.edu).  Or you can login to the campus network, compose the message in your e-mail program, and send it to [HIST100@KSU.EDU](mailto:hist100a@ksu.edu).   

  5. At the end of the semester, you can leave the list by composing an electronic mail message addressed to [LISTSERV@KSU.EDU](mailto:LISTSERV@KSU.EDU), leaving the subject line blank, and having the following commands as the ONLY text of the message:  

> > UNSUB HIST100 FIRSTNAME LASTNAME

>

> For example: if your name is Jane Jones, the message would read:

>

>> UNSUB HIST100 Jane Jones

**

Printing Messages: **The method varies with the system you are using to access
the campus network. The PRINT SCREEN button on many computers only prints
whatever's on the screen, not the entire file. Try typing the "y" key when you
are looking at the message you would like to print within Pine, then "Y" again
to say "Yes, print the message."  If you are using a system like Eudora or MS
Outlook, click on the print icon or go to "File" then "Print."  Be careful
when printing files: some of them could be very large.

**

Rules for Usage:** This list is for instructional purposes only. You must
abide by the spirit as well as the letter of rules for electronic discussions:
courtesy, honesty, and civility are of the utmost importance. As the
registered listowner, the instructor will not hesitate to unsubscribe and
penalize list members who use profanity, crowd the mailer with gossip or "junk
mail" announcements, falsify other list-members' userids or send mail under
another list member's name, harass subscribers, or who interfere with the
operation of the list. Use of the mainframe is subject to the regulations
implemented by Computing & Network Services. Students who abuse this privilege
are subject to academic discipline.   Current information technology policies
are available at: <http://www.ksu.edu/uauc/docs/policy.html>. If you
experience or know of misuse of the class discussion list please report such
activity to the class instructor.  Any form of harassment via e-mail should be
reported immediately.

**

Techniques: **You can reply to a message in any of several ways. Use your mail
program's "reply" function; when you press it while reading a message, the
program usually creates a new mail header and stands by to receive text from
you. You can just write a new message to the list, referring in it to the
message you are responding to. Write your name in the "name" header when
setting up your mail; and sign your name at the end of every message. When
contributing to the list, select a "subject" description that is clear and
concise. For instance, if asking about one of the study questions, write
"study question #3" in the subject heading.

**

Suggested Uses of the Class List:** Start a study group. Wait a week or two
after the start of the semester to give folks time to subscribe. Post a
message asking for volunteers; you needn't include a phone number
\--interested parties can contact you via e-mail off-list. Limit your group to
a manageable size. Divide up the labor, write up answers to study questions,
and post questions and issues on HIST100. Ask questions of each other. The
list isn't there just to ask _me_ about the course. Ask each other as well.
Respond to other people's messages. Raise issues, discuss study techniques,
and share ideas about preparing for the exams.

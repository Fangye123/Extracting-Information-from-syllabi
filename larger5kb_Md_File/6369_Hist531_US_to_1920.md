COURSE DESCRIPTION.  
**This course gives students in the Graduate Program in American History a
more in depth look at U.S. history in the period up to 1920\. Our task will be
three-fold: to learn something of the history of this period, to consider what
historians have written about the period, and, more broadly, to foster an
understanding of how historians think. The reading for this course will
emphasize historiography--that is, what historians have written. We will
examine the historiography through a chronological breakdown of the period, as
well as topically (areas such as social, intellectual, women's, African
American, etc.). Accordingly, each week's material contains a list of common
readings (roughly 80-100 pages focusing on historiography), as well as a list
of representative monographs on the given period or topic. Students will NOT
be expected to read ALL of these monographs for this course; they are intended
as a guide to further reading, reading of the kind students will need to do to
write a masters thesis (whether or not in one of these fields) and to pass
qualifying (comprehensive) exams in a Ph.D. program.**

REQUIREMENTS.

  1. **_Reviews:_** **Four (4) times during the semester for American M.A. students and three (3) times for non-Americanists, students will be expected to select one book from the list of supplementary readings and prepare a 750-1000 word review of that book for discussion in class (see also points c. and d. under "Further Notes"). This should be given to the instructor (in the mailbox is ok) no later than 1200 hours on the day **_**_before_**_ **the class meets; late reviews cannot be accepted.  
FURTHER NOTES:**

>   1. **When two or more students are doing reviews for a particular class,
they MUST NOT read the same book.**

>   2. **Students may do only one review for a given week.**

>   3. **At the end of this syllabus is**[ **a list of longer
books**](hist531_2.htm#double) **for possible review. A review of one of these
will count as two (2) of the required reviews. Although students may review
more than one of these books, only one will count double. Due anytime** _ **
_before_**_ **the last class meeting of the semester.**

>   4. **Students should not attempt to review a book they reviewed in a
previous course.**

>

  2. **_Historiography Paper:_** **As a concluding exercise for the course, students will be asked to compare and contrast two or more books on a similar topic, relating them as well to the larger historiography. Details of this assignment (including due date) will be distributed in a future class meeting.**
  3. **_Attendance/Participation:_** **This is a class based on discussion of assigned readings. Accordingly, attendance and active participation in discussions is expected of all those enrolled.**

ASSORTED THREATS AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

  1. **The Instructor reserves the right to make additional assignments if, in his judgment, students need extra incentive to do the weekly reading.**
  2. **Attendance:**

>   1. **Students with four (4) or more absences can receive no better than a
"C" for their participation grade. In other words, you get three (3) absences
before the penalties start.**

>   2. **Students absent for six (6) or more class meetings will receive an
"F" for their participation grade.**

>   3. **Students arriving to a particular class meeting more than 20 minutes
after the scheduled starting time will be considered absent for that class.**

>   4. **There is no such thing as an excused absence/lateness.**

>   5. **The week of Oct. 30-Nov. 3 there will be no class.**

>

  3. **Review Presentation: It should go without saying, but to be clear: All book reviews and the historiography paper must be written in impeccable English and typed/word processed, double-spaced, minimally 2.5 centimeter margins, and in a font size not requiring a magnifying glass to be read (12-point, please).**

FINAL GRADES.  
**Barring any additional assignments, final grades will be computed as
follows: (1) book reviews, total: 60%; (2) historiography paper, 20%; and (3)
class participation, 20%.**

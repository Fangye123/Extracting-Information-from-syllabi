>

>

> Literature 102 is an introduction to the literature, history, and culture of
Ancient Rome during the Hellenistic, Republican and Imperial  periods. The
course will focus on some of the most important literary  works of Roman
civilization. Because literature does not arise or existing a cultural or
historic vacuum, attention will be given to the historic background and those
events that influenced the Romans' understanding of themselves. The chief
interest of Roman literature has to do with the Romans' struggle to understand
their place in the world . Although they were generally devoted to their
traditions of democratic and republican government, the Romans nevertheless
created an empire that was as brutal as it was efficient. It is always
fascinating  to observe how Roman writers and thinkers attempted to reconcile
this political inconsistency by appeals to traditional notions of personal
morality and integrity. The Roman experience in confronting some of the
perennial issues of human freedom and human responsibility makes their
literature consistently relevant to an examination of those humanistic values
of Western civilization that transcend time and place.  aim of this course
then will be a direct and first hand examination of this literature in order
to understand and appreciate the continuing influence of Roman ideas on the
thinking of the modern world.  
>

>

>  
>

>

> In order to be successful in this course you will have to read carefully all
of the assigned texts and to participate fully in all class activities
(lectures, class discussions, and quizzes) and complete all written
assignments.  
>

>

>  
>  **Course Structure**  
>  In broad outline the course will consist of three emphases each with its
own focus:  
>  
>

>

>> * The Roman understanding of their place in history  
>  * The Roman Republic, the tragic failure of Rome's liberal democratic
institutions  
>  * The Roman Empire, the Roman understanding of its civilizing mission in
the cosmic scheme of things  
>

>

> Our class time will be devoted to considerations of the cultural and
historic background for the literary texts, basic issues of interpretation,
and discussion of the texts themselves. It is hoped that you will see these
discussions as an opportunity to interrogate, asit were, some thoughtful
Romans about their world and the ways in which they understood their place in
it.  
>  
>  ******Examinations**  
>  ****  
>  There will be three major examinations. They will typically comprise a
combination of objective-type questions (multiple choice, true/false,
completion), and essay type responses. These examinations will cover the
assigned readings and the information presented and discussed in class.  
>  
>  To do well on these examinations you will need to rely on a careful reading
of the texts, faithful class attendance, and good notes (your own notes are
always more reliable than someone else's).  
>  
>  ******Papers**  
>  In addition to these examinations you will be required to submit three
short papers (three to five typewritten pages) on a specific topic:  
>  
>  **Paper I** , due on Wednesday, January 30, will focus on Book I of Livy's
History. Topic: Choose one of the stories that Livy tells in Book I, and
explain what it might have meant for his Roman audience.  Specifically, what
ethical values, what important character traits is the story designed to
reveal, and, finally, what does the story say about what the Romans thought
about themselves?  
>  
>  **Paper II** , due on Wednesday, March 6, will focus on Books I and III of
Caesar's commentary on the Civil War. This paper will discuss the work as a
piece of political propaganda. Specifically, what are Caesar's aims in writing
it? What does he think are important Roman virtues?   Why are the ethical
virtues of his side superior to those of his enemies?  
>  
>  **Paper III** , due on Wednesday, April 17, will discuss the question of
how Vergil conceptualizes the relation between the Roman people and the powers
of the cosmos. What are the forces that stand in opposition to the Romans as
they seek to realize their destiny, and what are the ethical qualities that
enable them to win through at the end?  
>  
>  Students with a disability who need special consideration regarding the
taking of examinations or completing other assignments should make an
appointment with me to make appropriate arrangements.  
>  
>  **Grades** : Your final grade in this course will be determined by the
following items:  
>

>

>> 1) First Examination: (Wed. Feb. 20) 20% of Final Grade  
>  2) Second Examination: (Wed, Mar. 27) 25% of Final Grade  
>  3) Final Examination: (Tues, May 7, 11:15 to 12:15 pm) 25% of Final Grade  
>  4) Paper I: 10% of Final Grade  
>  5) Paper II: 10% of Final Grade  
>  6) Paper III: 10% of Final Grade  
>

>

> Please note: to receive a passing grade in this course, you will have to
have a grade for each and every one of these five items. This means that if,
for example, you miss (and do not make up) an examination, or do not submit
one of the three papers, you will receive an F for the course irrespective of
what the other grades might be.

>

>  
>  **Textbooks**  
>  ****

>

> The readings for which you will be responsible will be chosen from the
textbooks listed below. You are not required to read all of them in

>

> their entirety, but only the assigned portions. You are required, however,
to purchase and keep them available throughout the semester.  These readings
are a very important part of the course. Please pay close attention to the
schedule of readings, and make sure you have read the appropriate assignment
prior to the class in which it will be discussed.  These readings are part of
a specific sequence intended to complement the classroom lectures and
discussions, and they will also be the focus of questions on the examinations.

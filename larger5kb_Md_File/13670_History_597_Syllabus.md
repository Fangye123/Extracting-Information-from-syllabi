**What is History 597?**  
This course is designed to introduce students to careers in history and to the
major contemporary issues in the field of public history.  The public history
movement encompasses a great variety of historians, subject material,
approaches, and forums.  We will be combining discussion of theoretical issues
with practical experiences such as meeting public history professionals,
reviewing public history presentations, and planning a project.  This class
will be run as a seminar.  That means, primarily, that on a week to week basis
instead of having lectures we will spend most of our time discussing readings
and how those readings can be used to understand what we see and hear about
the different public history professions.  This course may be used to fulfill
the Historical Studies requirement.

**Assignments**  
Two reading review essays.  15% each.  5 pages each.  During the semester you
will write two papers reviewing the main themes of the readings.  
Interview with public history professional.  15%. Each student will do a
career history interview with a public history professional and write a 3-5
page paper on the lessons learned about working in public history.  You will
also give a brief oral report on the interview to the class.  
Site visit report.  15%.  Each student will visit a different public history
site in the Louisville area.  You will write a 3-5 page review of the site,
based on information in the course readings, and give a brief oral report on
the site to the class.  
Project proposal.  25%.  The major assignment in the class will be a proposal
for a potential local public history project.  You will be given extensive
directions for this assignment in class.  Briefly, the proposal will include a
local history subject, a description of the site or forum, a list of research
resources, an essay grounding the project in the issues raised in the
readings, and a grant application.  
Participation.  15%.  Because this is a seminar course, participation in
discussion is fundamental to your grade and to the success of the class.

**Rules**  
Students with disabilities: If you need extra time taking the tests or other
special  arrangements please see me as soon as possible.  
Attendance: I do not take attendance.  However, since you will be held
responsible for everything that is said in class, you must find out what you
missed.  Since participation in discussion is part of your grade, you should
be here in order to participate.  
Papers: Papers are due in class on the date assigned.  Late papers are
accepted with the  following excuses: serious illness with doctor's note
verifying the incapacitation, documented death in the immediate family.
Scheduled University functions will not count as excuses as it is possible for
you to turn the paper in early.  In addition, computer problems are not
acceptable excuses.  Please note: Late papers will only be accepted if the
student speaks to the professor privately, in advance.  Messages may be left
for the professor at the history department at any time BEFORE the class the
paper is due.  This rule applies to the end of the semester project as well.

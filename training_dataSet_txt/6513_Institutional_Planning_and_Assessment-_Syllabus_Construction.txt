If you have objections to serving as an experimental participant, the research requirement may be satisfied. . .  What do I do? This semester the requirement is to participate in five experiments.

When 'what the teacher wants' is sharedopenly with all the students, far more will succeed in the course. By showing we are reallyinterested in what they are supposed to be learning, and want them to master, more students willrespond by getting involved in our courses and trying to live up to those expectations (p. 1).     Syllabus Construction Guide   [USC Homepage][IPA Homepage][Assessment Homepage]  Last updated 2 May 2000   This page administered by IPA - ipa@sc.edu.This page copyright Â© 1999, The Board of Trustees of the University of South Carolina.URL http://kudzu.ipr.sc.edu/assessment/sampsyll.htm

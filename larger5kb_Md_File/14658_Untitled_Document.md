World Wide Web: If Medium Is the Message, the Message Is the Web

SAN FRANCISCO -- The Associated Press was formed in the mid-19th century when
a group of newspapers decided to invest  
jointly in a newfangled medium -- the telegraph -- to speed the collection and
dissemination of information.

Last week, A.P. announced that it would adopt a newer-fangled medium -- the
World Wide Web -- to begin distributing its articles and  
photographs over the global Internet. It was simply the latest, but perhaps
most historically significant, move yet by an old-line media  
organization into the World Wide Web, the Internet multimedia information-
retrieval system that appears on the verge of becoming a mass  
medium itself.

If the medium is the message, then the message these days is the World Wide
Web.

In short order the Web, which three years ago was little more than a research
tool for physicists and computer hobbyists, has flourished. It  
is being embraced by media concerns, consumer-product companies and businesses
of various stripes that are creating thousands of  
so-called Web sites each month, with the number of computers playing host to
one or more of these sites already exceeding 100,000.

Conservative estimates place the number of people who have used the Web in the
millions, and it is not hard to find more breathless  
estimates in the tens of millions.

Capable of letting people use computers to send and receive text, sound, still
images and video clips, the Web incorporates elements of  
the various print and electronic media that have preceded it. And yet, the Web
is poised not to replace its predecessors but to take a  
place alongside them as a social, cultural and economic force in its own
right.

Its complementary role is already evident: many radio stations and all the
major television networks have Web sites promoting their  
programs and stars. Newspapers, including The New York Times, are devising
cyberspace editions.

And few movies anymore are released without a promotional Web site, including
"Goldeneye" the James Bond film that opened this  
weekend at theaters everywhere and on the Web at the address http://
www.mgmua.com/bond. The site offers the movie's theme song  
performed by Tina Turner, more than a dozen video clips from the film and
illustrated biographies of the cast members.

Prime-time television commercials by Toyota and other advertisers now
routinely include a Web address. And Procter & Gamble, whose  
advertising has long helped underwrite the mass media, has even staked out
prime Web real estate by reserving addresses that include  
flu.com and toiletpaper.com.

"We are poised on the edge of a new medium," Clay Felker, director of the
magazine program at the University of California at Berkeley's  
graduate journalism school, said. "And it's going to change the nature of how
we acquire information."

As with each mass medium that has arrived before it, the Web has reached this
threshold through a confluence of a key technology, a  
ready audience and a stream of corporate backers willing to bet that
profitable businesses can be built on it. But few experts are willing to  
declare that the Web has taken its place in the mass media pantheon because
the profitable business formulas have yet to be found.

Newspapers and magazines make money by selling individual copies,
subscriptions and advertising space. Radio and television stations  
sell air time to those with money and a message. Movie theaters sell tickets.
But on the Web so far, despite seed-money by adventurous  
advertisers and some tentative efforts to charge for access to sites or
services, there is no certainty that this medium will achieve the critical  
mass that capitalism demands of its mass media.

"How do you make a business out of the World Wide Web?" asked Norman
Pearlstine, editor in chief of Time Inc., which has an  
experimental Web site called Pathfinder that offers selected contents from the
company's magazines (http://www.pathfinder.com). But  
because ad revenue alone is not carrying the freight, Time Inc. will begin
testing ways to charge visitors to its site.

And yet, the technological prerequisites are firmly in place. The Web is an
outgrowth of the Internet, which began as an academic  
research experiment in the late 1960's. For more than two decades the Internet
remained largely inaccessible, used mainly by computer  
scientists and Pentagon researchers, university scholars and students.

Then came the World Wide Web.

Like the Internet, the Web began as a tool to let scientists easily and
quickly share information. Conceived in the late 1980's by Tim  
Berners-Lee, who was then a software designer at CERN, the Swiss physics
research center, the basic Web technology was first put to  
use in 1990.

The big breakthrough came in 1992, when student researchers at the National
Center for Supercomputing Applications in Illinois created  
Mosaic, a simple software tool called a Web browser. Mosaic permitted access
to information anywhere on the World Wide Web by  
letting the user point and click a computer mouse on highlighted words or
images on the screen. The browser, which became available in  
commercial versions like Netscape Communications' Navigator, not only made Web
sites easily accessible, it prompted businesses,  
organizations and even individuals to create new Web sites by the thousands.

Thus did the Web quickly become a standard and accepted way for the growing
millions of the computer-literate to communicate and to  
entertain and inform themselves. And unlike each previous mass medium, the Web
does not require its audience to be merely passive  
recipients of information.

For very little money, and with a modicum of computer skills, virtually anyone
can create his or her own Web site. Anyone with a modem  
is potentially a global pamphleteer.

One consequence of this democratization is that the Web can be a remarkably
anarchic forum compared with the old-style mass media.  
"Think of this as television colliding with the telephone party line," said
Paul Saffo, a computer industry consultant at the Institute for the  
Future, a Menlo Park, Calif., research firm. "In terms of social consequences,
the Web is a great experiment. It's going to deliver us  
community with a vengeance -- and we may find we don't want it." \-- JOHN
MARKOFF

Radio: From Dots and Dashes to Rock and Larry King

he full technological potential of radio was made manifest on Christmas Eve
1906. Its potential as a form of mass communication  
did not become evident until much later.

Radio had been invented by Guglielmo Marconi in 1895 as "wireless telegraphy"
\-- a means for sending Morse code through the air. But  
on Dec. 24, 1906, a few wireless operators on ships in the North Atlantic
heard not the usual dots and dashes but a voice reading from  
St. Luke's Gospel. It was Reginald Fessenden, an American who had devised a
means for radio waves to carry signals for a range of  
sound. "Wireless telephony" had arrived.

Soon, amateur radio operators in the United States and elsewhere were using
this technology to chat with each other. After World War I,  
radio's future seemed to be in transmitting long-distance telephone calls, and
the American Telephone and Telegraph Company made sure  
it rounded up the key patents.

Some radio buffs set themselves up as broadcasters, playing music or reading
newspapers to anyone who tuned in. But, as the historian  
Daniel Czitrom wrote, "virtually no one in the scientific, amateur, military
or corporate communities had expected broadcasting to become  
the main use of wireless technology."

Indeed, the word broadcasting, which meant scattering widely, had not yet been
applied to radio.

Then, in the fall of 1920, a Westinghouse Electric executive, Harry P. Davis,
had an epiphany. The attention that a Westinghouse engineer  
had attracted with his amateur transmissions from his garage in East
Pittsburgh, Davis later wrote, "caused the thought to come to me that  
the efforts that were then being made to develop radio-telephony as a
confidential means of communication were wrong, and that instead  
its field was really one of wide publicity." Davis realized, in other words,
that radio transmissions could be heard by the masses.

On Nov. 2, 1920, at Davis's urging, Westinghouse introduced what is considered
the first commercial radio station -- KDKA in  
Pittsburgh -- with a report on the Harding-Cox Presidential voting. By the end
of 1922, 576 commercial radio stations were operating in  
the United States.

But a large question remained: How would these new stations make money?
Davis's financial goal for KDKA was simply to help  
Westinghouse sell more radios, and in 1922 about 100,000 radio receivers were
purchased in the United States. But that same year, AT  
was already introducing a new way to profit by charging people who wanted to
broadcast from AT's transmitters a "toll" for access to the  
audience of its growing group of stations. The strategy rapidly evolved into
the the advertiser-supported model of broadcasting.

By 1925, 5.5 million radio sets were in use in the United States, and what was
in Davis's words "the only means of instantaneous  
collective communication ever devised" had begun to capture its mass audience.
The following year AT -- recognizing that radio no longer  
seemed to have much to do with telephony -- sold its stations to the newly
created National Broadcasting Company. -- MITCHELL

Printing Press: Yelling 'Stop the Presses!' Didn't Happen Overnight

hough the Chinese invented printing, in the West the printing press dates to
around 1450. But it took two inventions of the Industrial  
Revolution -- the steam engine and the telegraph -- to turn it into what we
would now define as a mass medium: one that can reach  
all segments of a population quickly and at a relatively low cost. All these
elements did not come together until about 100 years ago.

Until the 19th century, books were printed on hand-operated presses. So were
newspapers. All those famous early journalists \-- Daniel  
Defoe, Jonathan Swift, Samuel Johnson, Benjamin Franklin -- saw their work
coming off flat presses, slowly.

In 1800 no press was much different from Gutenberg's 350 years earlier -- hand
operated and fed one sheet of paper at time. But  
newspapers were becoming important as democratic ideas spread, and most major
innovations in printing after 1800 came in response to  
demands of newspapers for faster printing.

In 1810 Friedrich Koenig, a German working in London, harnessed steam power to
operate a press that rolled a cylinder over a paper  
sheet lying on a bed of inked type, instead of pressing a flat weight on it
like the old hand presses. In 1814 The Times of London installed  
such a press, with automatic inking rollers. It was still fed paper one sheet
at a time, but it could print 1,100 sheets an hour, four times the  
pace of hand presses. During the next 30 years further improvements raised
that rate fourfold, and the circulation of The Times rose from  
5,000 in 1815 to 50,000 in the 1850's.

But fast printing required a rotary press -- basically a cylinder with type
fixed to its surface, which rolled against another cylinder as paper  
passed between the two. The problem was to make curved plates of type to fit
on the cylinder. Flat solid type plates were known since  
1795, but it took another 50 years to develop curved ones. The first rotary
press was patented by Richard Hoe in New York in 1846,  
and the technology quickly found its way into newspapers, which were able to
greatly increase their circulations. By 1860 The Daily  
Telegraph in London was rolling out 130,000 copies a day.

Other improvements followed: automated printing from continuous rolls of
paper; four-cylinder presses capable of printing on both sides  
of the paper simultaneously; high-speed lithography, and folding and cutting
machines.

Speed and volume alone would not necessarily have made print a mass medium,
however -- at least not in the news business. The  
telegraph, invented in 1844, made it possible to gather information globally
and send it anywhere. Newspaper owners initially saw it as a  
competitor, but they quickly co-opted it. In 1848 six daily papers in New York
jointly financed a telegraph line to Boston to get the first  
news from ships arriving from Europe, which stopped in Massachusetts before
heading south. In 1856 they called themselves the New  
York Associated Press and started selling a wire service that led to the
founding of The Associated Press. By 1870, 180,000 miles of  
wire criss-crossed the United States.

Further developments in printing came in the 1890's, with the invention of
linotype and monotype machines, allowing pages to be filled as  
fast as the machine operators could type copy. Joseph Pulitzer's New York
World attracted worldwide attention when its daily circulation  
hit 374,000 in 1892. By 1900, The Daily Mail in London was selling a million
copies a day.

A mass medium, for a mass audience, had arrived. -- D. J. R. BRUCKNER

Motion Pictures: In 'The Birth of a Nation,' The Birth of Serious Film

he defining moment for the motion picture as a mass medium, an art form and a
disturbingly powerful social force occurred on a  
bitterly cold night on March 3, 1915, at the Liberty Theater in New York. It
was the world premiere of D. W. Griffith's "The Birth  
of a Nation," an event of such cultural magnitude that 80 years later,
controversies still rage among film scholars over its racially charged  
images.

Until that time, the movie industry had not demonstrated its irreversible
dominance as mainstream entertainment. Ambitious movies had  
been made before 1915, but never had audiences been so moved. "Birth of a
Nation," which would become the most widely seen movie  
of its era, made it clear that film was a medium that could generate powerful
emotions, even in the White House, where President  
Woodrow Wilson would say of Griffith's movie, "It is like writing history with
lightning."

An epic that ran two hours and 40 minutes (the need to interject screens of
dialogue text tended to make silent features longer than their  
subsequent "talkie" counterparts would be), the film traced the shifting
fortunes of two related families in the North and the South on the  
eve of the Civil War, during the war and in the tumultuous Reconstruction that
followed.

Griffith, a Southerner by birth, could remember from his childhood all the
horror stories about Reconstruction. But the major source of the  
movie's racial bigotry was "The Clansman," Thomas Dixon's overwrought novel of
hate and intolerance, from which the film was adapted.

The film's most inflammatory scenes involve the sexual pursuit of two white
women by liberated black slave men, and the heroic rescue of  
the women by members of a glorified Ku Klux Klan. Most, but not all, of the
black roles were played by white actors in blackface.

Besides helping to revive the actual Klan as a force in American life, the
movie's melodramatic treatment of sexual encounters between  
blacks and whites cast miscegenation as a screen taboo that would be observed
by the Production Code of the Motion Picture  
Association of America well into the 1950's.

A decade after the debut of "Birth of a Nation," even the acclaimed Soviet
film makers Sergei Eisenstein and Vsevolod Pudovkin were  
hailing Griffith for his artistic refinement of such devices as varied screen
sizes, close-ups, parallel narratives and symbolic imagery.

But his incendiary propaganda for racial superiority has continually presented
serious film scholars with a persistent problem: How to  
reconcile the enormous technical and stylistic advances of the first genius in
the medium with his deplorably provincial reading of American  
history?

Griffith's heroines, too, were paradoxical -- delicate flowers of the
antebellum South, yet iron willed in defense of their chastity. Much of  
the movie's intensity came from the remarkable performances of Lillian Gish
and Mae Marsh as quintessential Victorian heroines, buffeted  
by the tides of social change.

In Griffith's masterpiece, sublimity of expression was marred by a
melodramatic racism. Yet "The Birth of a Nation," warts and all,  
remains a

milestone: the movie that catapulted the medium from its 19th-century peep-
show origins into its status as the great new popular art form  
of the 20th century. -- MOLLY HASKELL

Television: Lucy Sure Didn't Start It, But She Has Stuck to It

ilton Berle may have been its first big star, but television's "killer app"
was the coast-to-coast network broadcast.

The capability of beaming a single program into every city, town and rural
hamlet in America changed the very nature of the medium --  
from a quirky, eclectic, mainly urban phenomenon to a coolly efficient
entertainment-delivery system aimed at the widest possible  
audience. For better or for worse, it turned television into the unstoppable
financial and cultural force that it is today.

True nationwide programming began on Nov. 18, 1951, when Edward R. Murrow,
during the first broadcast of his "See It Now" series,  
gazed solemnly at a live split-screen image of the Golden Gate and Brooklyn
Bridges and said, "We are impressed by a medium through  
which a man sitting in his living room has been able for the first time to
look at two oceans at once."

The East and West Coasts had just been linked by coaxial cable \-- an unwieldy
and inefficient method of long-distance transmission, as  
anyone who has ever lived too far from his cable company knows. Nevertheless,
the final linkup was an event comparable in importance  
to the driving of the golden spike in the transcontinental railroad.

Thus it was that in 1951 -- not coincidentally, the same year that a new
comedy, "I Love Lucy," became television's first true national hit  
\-- the young television networks, like their radio forebears (whose coast-to-
coast audio signals had traveled comfortably via conventional  
phone lines) were able to offer the entire country the same programs
simultaneously. TV executives quickly realized that most of its newly  
served viewers in rural and suburban areas wanted to be soothed and amused
rather than challenged or titillated.

Before 1951, the airwaves were dominated by live shows: New York-based dramas
and such raucous, vaudeville-like variety programs  
as Berle's "Texaco Star Theater" and Sid Caesar and Imogene Coca's "Admiral
Broadway Revue." And the so-called golden age of live  
television drama, fueled by talented refugees from the legitimate stage,
lasted for the next few years.

But after 1951, milder comedies and adventure shows, most of them produced in
Hollywood, held sway. Desi Arnaz and others  
perfected the three-camera method of filming situation comedies in front of
live audiences for later broadcast. It freed television from the  
tyranny of the stage's proscenium arch and allowed comedies to be "sweetened"
with prerecorded laughter. The shows could also be  
quickly filmed and edited and rerun in perpetuity.

The programs now had to be tailored for Middle American tastes. Milton Berle
and Sid Caesar gradually gave way to the likes of Red  
Skelton and Dinah Shore; golden-age figures like Paddy Chayevsky moved on to
the movies. By taking the middle road, the networks  
stimulated sales of television sets and delivered huge audiences for
advertisers -- charging sponsors princely sums for the privilege.

Meanwhile, the Hollywood movie studios, whose theater audiences had been cut
in half by television, began to use their empty sets and  
sound stages to turn out cheap black-and-white westerns and police shows for
the small screen.

Television was one of those seemingly instant socioeconomic breakthroughs that
in fact had been a long time coming. The basic technical  
research that led to practical methods of sending pictures through the air had
been largely completed by the mid-1920's. On July 21,  
1931, an NBC-owned station in New York, W2XAB, began the nation's first
regularly scheduled television broadcasts.

Throughout the 1930's a few other quasi-commercial stations sprang up in big
cities. But prewar television sets had tiny, flickering screens  
\-- and the slapdash programs being improvised by techies and true believers
at the stations made no dent at all in radio's popularity.

During World War II the technical kinks were worked out of television and the
radio networks were prepared to make a big push into the  
new medium. The first televised World Series, the 1947 matchup that saw the
Yankees beat the Dodgers in seven games, drew an  
estimated total of 3.9 million viewers -- 3.5 million of whom watched it in
bars.

In 1950, fewer than 10 percent of all households had a television set. By
1953, the figure was 40 percent, on its way to 90 percent by the  
end of the decade.

The United States was truly becoming one nation. On Monday night, Jan. 19,
1953, 69 percent of all the sets in use were tuned to the  
episode of "I Love Lucy" in which Lucille Ball's character, Lucy Ricardo, gave
birth to a son.

That same week, Ms. Ball gave birth to her real son, Desi Arnaz Jr. His
picture was published shortly afterward in the premiere issue of  
TV Guide, which would become the best-selling magazine in America. \-- ANDY

**Course Description**  
---  
Multimedia systems are playing an increasing role in most aspects of
information technology, impacting the design of hardware, software, networks
and applications. Multimedia is also one of the critical links in the ongoing
unification of computing and communications. Multimedia systems require a
truly interdisciplinary approach, combining hardware, software, networks,
perception and signal theory. This course introduces students to the systems
issues in multimedia, providing a unified view of the way that multimedia
applications are implemented as well as specific details on the design of
various multimedia system components. Students will use various web-based
tools developed under a recent NSF grant to learn the various engineering
issues in multimedia (e.g. network performance, compression algorithms,
errors). The course will present simple intuitive explanations of multimedia
systems, avoiding the advanced mathematics required for a thorough
understanding, but providing sufficient depth to understand the multimedia
issues in larger IT systems.

**Computer Requirements**  
---  
Students will need an ECS or OIT account with access to various multimedia
input and output devices and programs in addition to general web-access.Access
to various input devices will also be useful but not required.The course will
use ECS and CSE web-servers with sufficient disk space for video.Each group
will share in the purchase of software (e.g. Director) and peripherals (e.g.
WebCAM) for the final project to help defray costs.

algorithms on compression rate, network/storage requirement and resulting
video quality.We will explore the tradeoffs ranging from low bit rate video
conferencing up to high quality MPEG coding for distance learning.

**Project Assignment:**  
A project studying the use of the MP3 audio compression format. Since this is
now a widely used format for internet-delivery of consumer audio, we expect
this topic to be very accessible and attractive to all levels of students.
Cool Edit 2000 will be used to analyze audio, compressed and uncompressed,
more indepthly.

**Project Assignment:**  
For the final project, students will work in groups of three or four to
design, implement, analyze and test a web-based or CD-based multimedia
system.This will integrate the various aspects of the course and will allow
the students to explore the real issues in a multimedia system. An example
design project might be a multimedia system for education. All final projects
will be published on a course web-page and evaluated by the entire class.

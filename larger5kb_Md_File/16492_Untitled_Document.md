WARSAW -- When Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic formally join NATO on
Friday, it will symbolize the return of three  
nations to the center of European civilization.

The Polish foreign minister, Bronislaw Geremek, a soulful historian of the
medieval world, compares the importance of NATO accession  
to nothing less than Poland's conversion to Christianity nearly 1,000 years
ago.

President Aleksander Kwasniewski of Poland said enlarging the alliance  
brings an end to a divided Europe. "This is the most important moment in  
our history," he said.

For Vaclav Havel, the Czech president, who was in jail in the Communist  
regime, membership means that "we will have a solid security anchoring  
for the first time in our history, and an anchoring in the democratic world,  
in the world of protection of democratic values."

By their history and geography, these new members will help to protect  
and even promote those values. But NATO tenure requires high defense  
spending and difficult choices at home just as the regional economy is  
cooling off, with the Czechs now in negative growth, a yawning Hungarian  
budget deficit and Polish growth expected to drop this year to 3.5 percent  
of its economy.

As the reality of membership looms -- together with the prospect of  
NATO bombing Yugoslavia -- popular enthusiasm for the alliance has  
dropped in all three countries. Recent polls say some 60 percent of Poles  
and Hungarians favor membership now, down from over 80 percent a  
year ago, and just over 50 percent of Czechs, down from about 55  
percent.

But all three governments remain enthusiastic about the alliance and committed
to increased  
defense spending. They are already contributing with peacekeepers, logistics
and intelligence to  
the West's complicated efforts in the Balkans.

At first, these three countries will add little to NATO's military capacities.
In fact, they have just  
managed to meet the alliance's minimum military requirements for integrated
air defense, security  
procedures and language training.

But few doubt that they will bring real military benefits to the alliance over
the next five to 10  
years, as they make the slow shift from heavily armored forces top-heavy with
officers, to more  
mobile, flexible and smaller armies.

Six weeks before the alliance's 50th anniversary summit in Washington -- where
the champagne  
and the rhetoric will overflow -- members continue to argue about the
alliance's future.

But these three countries also bring a fresh dose of support to Washington's
aims for redirecting  
NATO's mission, officials of all three countries suggest. It was the United
States, after all, that  
pushed their membership the hardest, a Polish official said. "We want to be
good Europeans," he  
said. "But more than anyone except perhaps the British, we understand how
important it is to  
keep the Americans involved in Europe."

For the militaries of all three nations, NATO membership is also a chance to
pacify, if not bury,  
some ghosts. While some officers feel they are simply exchanging the language
of one empire for  
another, most recognize that it is a voluntary alliance that works by
consensus.

Col. Petr Vlcnovsky, who commands a Czech air defense brigade, said that
membership in the  
Warsaw Pact meant a depressing servility to Moscow's orders. A military
career, he said,  
commanded little social respect. "We had no opportunity to make decisions as a
sovereign state,"  
he said. "Now we can decide for ourselves, as a full partner in NATO
committees."

In Poland, the military, like the Roman Catholic Church, is at the center of
its national identity, and  
the Hungarians, too, have an important military tradition that dates predates
the Austro-Hungarian  
empire. While there is some truth to "The Good Soldier Svejk" notion of the
Czech military man  
\-- survival despite apparent bungling in 300 years of occupation \-- Czech
soldiers have served  
with distinction alongside the British in Bosnia and the Americans in the
Persian Gulf.

Such successes -- like Poland's peacekeeping efforts around the world and
Hungary's engineering  
battalion, which has rebuilt 84 bridges in four years in Bosnia \-- will go a
long way to raise the  
stature of the military within society, says Tamas Wachsler, the young state
secretary of the  
Hungarian Defense Ministry.

"The key to rebuilding the overall character and prestige of the military is
to give it teeth," he said.  
"NATO helps, not just by providing world standards but by opening up
international careers to  
officers."

By insisting on civilian control over the military, the alliance makes it
easier to reform these armies  
and subordinate them to the popular will, a senior Polish official said.

"Poland has never before had a modern democracy, and the military, like the
church, has never  
been a democratic institution in Poland," he said. "The real test for NATO --
and for Poland -- is  
how to deal with undemocratic institutions and make them compatible with
democracy."

That process has started. Of Poland's 130 generals, fewer than 10 had the rank
before 1989.  
"But it will also take time," the senior official said.

Deep in a bunker under the Czech town of Stara Boleslav, there is a
sophisticated Warsaw Pact  
air defense command headquarters that has been transformed with American aid
into an alliance  
facility that keeps watch over Czech airspace.

There are similar centers in Poland and Hungary, and the American ambassadors
to all three  
countries talk enthusiastically about their "Dr. Strangelove" quality, with
their huge overhead  
screens and sophisticated computers. The facilities will also help make
commercial air travel safer  
for civilians.

All three centers opened only last month, but they were the most crucial
military requirement for  
joining NATO. The new members could hardly be defended without an integrated
air defense  
system, coupled with 24-hour patrols and jet fighters with a rapid reaction
capability.

"That said," noted a senior military attache for a western country, "all the
air crews need better  
tactics, training and doctrine." Officials in all three countries expressed
concern that while defense  
spending is increasing, the funds going to operations and training, especially
for combat pilots, is  
insufficient or dropping. Except for the immediate front-line pilots, training
hours are well below  
NATO standards.

Hungary, for instance, gives 27 pilots it must have for air defense NATO's
standard of 100 hours  
of training, while other pilots currently get only one hour; last November,
some 40 Polish pilots  
quit over insufficient training.

While all three countries have met the minimum military requirements, the
training issue is a good  
example of the significant work that remains to be done to make membership
less hollow.

But this was the alliance's choice, argues a senior Hungarian official. "NATO
rightly decided to  
invite key countries to join, provide them minimum requirements to reach in a
short term, and  
work with them to bring them up to speed," the official said. "The chances of
a significant NATO  
military operation are very small so it's OK to have some countries below NATO
standards now,  
under the assumption they will reach them in five years."

Other minimum requirements the three countries worked to meet include
sometimes humdrum  
issues like the compatibility of communications equipment, adapter nozzles for
fuel lines and  
security procedures, so Western intelligence can be shared.

Outside Poland's sprawling old Defense Ministry headquarters, for instance,
there are new gates and electronically controlled turnstiles,  
while new locks, safes and procedures have been installed in all three
countries for handling NATO secrets.

Even here, the past intercedes, but in an ironic way. The Czechs were slow to
vet enough officers to take up positions in the alliance's  
headquarters in Brussels or to handle NATO papers. The reason was a recent
Czech security law requiring psychological exams and  
other queries that go beyond the alliance's standards.

The Czechs were so scarred by the misuse of security and the extent of
collaboration with the secret police under the Communist regime  
that they set very high standards. "In the long run, that will benefit us,"
said Petr Necas, chairman of Parliament's Defense and Security  
Committee, reflecting lingering concerns within NATO about intelligence-
sharing with former Communist militaries.

In Hungary, similarly, two-thirds of those elected to Parliament must vote to
allow Hungarian troops to operate outside the country.

Even for Friday's celebration for joining the alliance, Parliament had to vote
to allow British Grenadiers to bring their ceremonial swords  
into the country.

These laws make it more complicated, but hardly impossible, to participate in
NATO exercises, Wachsler said. An effort to amend the  
constitution recently fell apart over internal political wrangling.

Another important requirement is training in English, NATO's lingua franca.
While they have met initial quotas, such training has gone  
slowly in all three countries.

Vlcnovsky, the Czech commander, was interviewed in his advanced English class
in an exquisite 14th-century castle in Komorni Hradek,  
near Brno. The castle was originally seized from a Nazi collaborator in 1945,
and later served as a school for political commissars.

The Czechs have restored the baroque chapel where uniforms used to be stored
and now use the classrooms for some 90 students taking  
basic and advanced English. In one classroom, the words "body odor" were on
the blackboard -- an indication, the teacher explained,  
that preparation for service abroad covered "many aspects of life."

For Vlcnovsky and his classmates, better English is a career-builder. "The
chances of us fighting a war on our own territory now are very  
small compared to the possibility of serving abroad, in Bosnia or elsewhere,"
he said. "English is simply necessary for our future careers."

Despite the problems of transition, all three countries have worked with the
alliance to ensure that they are providing immediate resources  
and capabilities to the alliance.

The Hungarians, for instance, have long provided Western access to the big
Warsaw Pact airbase at Taszar where several hundred  
American and other foreign troops handled Western deployments into Bosnia.
They also permit NATO troops to be stationed there and  
to fly over Hungarian territory for surveillance of Serbia, Kosovo and the
Albanian border, even though there is a Hungarian community in  
the Balkans and patrols could lead to bombing.

Hungary will also provide two brigades for NATO's rapid reaction force and a
medical team with a hospital.

The Czechs specialize in defense against chemical and biological weapons and
are providing a chemical defense company of about 140  
people for immediate NATO service.

The Czechs sent similar forces to the Gulf War, and have worked alongside
British troops in Bosnia "at a high level of competence," a  
British official said.

For their part, the Poles are providing an excellent anti-terrorist unit, some
of whom already protect William Walker, the U.S. diplomat  
who runs the international observers in Kosovo. They are providing an air
assault brigrade of paratroopers and some armored units, as  
well as some 10,000 troops as part of a German-Danish-Polish mechanized corps
headquartered in Szczecin. The Poles have been  
reluctant, however, to reduce their armor as quickly as the West would like.

But the biggest tasks are yet to come. All three countries need to modernize a
Warsaw Pact structure that contained too many officers  
without enough initiative. They need to train a corps of noncommissioned
officers, reduce the number of colonels by half and teach  
soldiers to make decisions.

Everyone agrees that changing mentality will be as difficult as finding the
economic resources over the next five and 10 years to keep  
modernization on track. "The real question is staying power over time," a
senior NATO official said.

Maj. Gen. Jaroslav Hudec, who directs Czech defense modernization, said
bluntly: "We've done our minimum requirements. Some will  
complain on March 12, but hourly it will be hard work for us, not just before
joining NATO but afterwards. We must all -- military  
officers and politicians -- continue to persuade everyone what must be done.
We must move from a Warsaw Pact force to another kind,  
and it must be done for ourselves, for our nation, not just because of NATO."

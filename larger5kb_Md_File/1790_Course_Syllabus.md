**Earth Science 201** : Geology of Georgia  
Fall 2000  
August 21  \- December 11

  

COURSE DESCRIPTION: Earth Science 201 is an accelerated course based on
physical and historical geology. Students will learn the fundamentals of
mineralogy, petrology, geomorphology, and plate tectonics as they relate to
the southeastern region of the United States. Emphasis will be place on the
application and understanding of geology porocesses as they relate to "real
world" problems (e.g., groundwater contamination, erosion due to
deforestation, environmental influences on extinction, etc.).  
Lecture meets 75 min./twice weekly, laboratory meets 2 hours/weekly.

4 Credit hours.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Grading will be based on lecture and laboratory
examinations, laboratory exercises, quizzes, homeworks, and two field trips.
The percentage that each of these requirements will contribute to the over all
grade for the course is given below:

Lecture component: 65%                 Laboratory component: 35%

The grade for each component will be determined using the criteria below:

COURSE OBJECTIVES:  
This course is designed such that students should gain knowledge and
appreciation of the geologic processes, past and present, that are responsible
for our present environment.

TOPICS TO BE COVERED:  
    Mineralogy - composition and sturcture of minerals, uses and economic importance of local mineral resourses (gold, kaolin, etc.)   
    Petrology - chemistry and formation of igneous, metamorphic, and sedimentary rocks, uses and economic importance of local rocks (granite, marble)   
    Geomorphology - formation of landscapes, influences on the formation of landscapes, reading of topographic and geologic maps.   
    Hydrology - major watershed systems in Georgia, the location, and treatment of Georgia's water resources.   
    Georgia's other natural resources \- State and national parks, forests, conservation lands. Forest management and other uses.   
    Plate tectonics - Major geologic provinces of Georgia, formation of the Appalachains, formation and evolution of metamorphic/igneous terranes present in Georgia.   
    Geologic history - Age of formation of the Appalachains in a global context as well as the formation of the Coastal Plain.

CLASS POLICIES:

_Lecture:_ You are expected to be prepared for each lecture period by reading
the material to be covered in lecture prior to attending class. This will
enable you to formulate questions about the material and comprehend the
material better during lecture. All students are expected to attend all
classes. Attendance will be taken. There are no excused absences. Prior
approval is required to miss a lecture exam. If a student misses an exam, with
out making arrangements _prior_ to missing the exam, a zero will be recorded
for that exam.

_Laboratory:_ You are expected to be fully prepared for each lab. Lab time is
limited and in order for you to complete the lab assignment in the allotted
time it is critical that you come to lab with a complete understanding of the
assignment. I suggest that you make any tables, calculations, etc., that you
can, prior to attending lab. Unless otherwise stated, lab assignments will be
turned in before leaving the laboratory. One absence is allowed (i.e., the
grade for one lab assignment will be dropped if all the lab assignments are
turned at the appropriate time). No make-up labs will be allowed, therefore
any missed labs (beyond the first one) will be deducted from your lab grade.  
    


\- Any students with learning disabilities are directed to the Academic
Support Center for help in study strategies, note-taking strategies, etc.

 **American Foreign Policies (PS 314)  
M, W, and F, 1:00-1:50pm  
Fall 1998**

**COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVE**

This course will attempt to build an understanding of the substance and
process of American foreign policy. To do this, we will examine a host of
foreign policy sources emanating from the international system, domestic
political institutions, and American society. An examination of these sources
will help improve our understanding of foreign policy outcomes. The
investigation of this array of foreign policy inputs will also help to explain
the patterns and continuity in US foreign policy since the end of World War
II. Finally, the course will provide a basis for understanding some of the
challenges the US faces in the post-Cold War era.

**READING**

There is a substantial amount of reading for this course. You will see that
the readings will vary in terms of difficulty. While some readings will be
quite challenging, others will be less difficult. In the semester schedule
(below), I have indicated the readings to be completed each week. I expect you
to complete each week's reading before Friday's class. I have also indicated
some recommended readings. These readings are intended to supplement course
material, but they are not required. Some of this material will form the basis
for classroom discussion. You may also find this material valuable as you
prepare your research paper.

_Advice to the wise_ (please skip this paragraph if you prefer a more
difficult semester): This class will be far more rewarding for you if you keep
up with the reading. With the reading material fresh in your head, you will be
more engaged while listening to lectures and contributing to discussions.
Remember, it is far more difficult to catch up on your reading after falling
behind with it than it is to simply keep up with it.

_Required texts:_

_American Foreign Policy_ , Charles W. Kegley, Jr., and Eugene R. Wittkopf  
_The Future of American Foreign Policy_ (3rd ed.), Eugene R. Wittkopf and
Christopher M. Jones  
_American Foreign Policy_ , Annual Editions 98/99

**A NOTE ON ATTENDANCE**

Attending class on a regular basis is necessary in order to do well in the
course. I do not require your attendance, but you should require it of
yourself if you want to learn as much as possible in the course.

| **MU Policy on Academic Honesty**  
---  
Academic dishonesty is an offense against the University. A student who has
committed an act of academic dishonesty has failed to meet a basic requirement
of satisfactory academic performance. Thus, academic dishonesty is not only a
basis for disciplinary action, but is also relevant to the evaluation of the
student's level of performance.

Academic dishonesty includes, but is not necessarily limited to the following:

  * **Cheating** , or knowingly assisting another student in committing an act of cheating or other academic dishonesty.  

  * **Plagiarism** which includes but is not necessarily limited to, submitting examinations, themes, reports, drawings, laboratory notes or other material as one's own work when such work has been prepared by another person or copied from another person.  

  * **Unauthorized possession of examinations** or reserve library materials, or laboratory materials or experiments or any other similar actions.  

  * **Unauthorized changing of grades** or markings on an examination or in an instructor's grade book or such change of any grade record.

Any student who commits an act of academic dishonesty is subject to
disciplinary action. The University has specific academic dishonesty
administrative procedures. Although policy states that cases of academic
dishonesty must be reported to the Office of the Provost for possible action,
instructors may assign a failing grade for an assignment, or a failing grade
for the course, or may adjust a grade as deemed appropriate. Instructors also
may require students to repeat the assignment or to perform additional
assignments.  
  
**OFFICE HOURS**

My office hours are noted on the first page of this syllabus. This time may be
inconvenient for some individuals. I encourage you to schedule an appointment
at a more convenient time if you like. Office hours are provided to students
as an extra resource to learn. I strongly encourage you to take advantage of
them whenever you want. Most importantly, you do not have to be confused about
the readings to come and talk with me about them.

**SPECIAL PROBLEMS**

Do you have a problem writing essay exams? See me. If you have any special
learning difficulties, please see me. Are you on medication that might hinder
your performance in the course in some way? See me. We can work around any
special problem or concern you might have. However, this is only possible if
you come and tell me in ADVANCE. I will be very unsympathetic to any request
to makeup an exam after the exam has already been given. Again, if you
anticipate difficulty attending an examination due to illness or other
emergency, see me in advance.

_Computer-related problems:_ Computers, like most machines, break down
occasionally. College students, like most people, make mistakes occasionally.
Taken together, we often find college students who are very angry at
themselves or at their computers for the sudden disappearance of an important
paper. Ultimately, you are responsible for backing up your own work and caring
properly for your own computing equipment. I will grant extensions for papers
due to computer-related problems, but only in the rarest of circumstances.
First, I will not entertain any requests for extensions due to computer-
related problems made to me within 12 hours of the paper's due date. If you
expect computer difficulties to make it impossible for you to submit a paper
by the due date (and that due date is not within 12 hours away) contact me and
we will discuss alternative arrangements for you.

**[Course Description](Course Description.html)**  
  "The Human Heritage" explores basic themes to understand the role of the
past in shaping the present. The course features a set of case studies, each
of which concentrates on how changes in ideas, social structure, patterns in
everyday life, law, or medicine affect a wide range of other social habits.
Each case study starts with the testimony of the past in documents out of
which the students create models of the causes for historical change.

###  Policies

  
**Academic Honesty:** Make yourself familiar with the college
[standards](http://www.mcla.mass.edu/academics/catalog/other/acaaffa.html#standards),
including the policy on academic dishonesty and plagiarism. Plagiarism will
result in a failing grade in the course and a report to the academic dean and
the registrar. It may result in suspension or expulsion from the college.  Any
behavior that fails to follow the below guidelines is plagiarism:

> The use of source materials of any kind and the preparation of essays or
laboratory reports must be fully and properly acknowledged. In papers or
laboratory reports, students are expected to acknowledge any expression or
idea that is not their own. Students submitting papers are implying that the
form and content of the essays or reports, in whole and in part, represent
their own work, except where clear and specific reference is made to other
sources. Even if there is no conscious intention to deceive, the failure to
make appropriate acknowledgment may constitute plagiarism.

> Any quotation - even of a phrase - must be placed in quotation marks and the
precise source stated in a note or in the text; any material that is
paraphrase or summarized and any ideas that are borrowed must be specifically
acknowledged. A thorough reordering or rearrangement of an author's text does
not release the student from these responsibilities. All sources that have
been consulted in the preparation of the essay or report should be listed in
the bibliography. (MCLA On-line Catalog,
<http://www.mcla.mass.edu/academics/catalog/other/acaaffa.html#standards>)  
  
---  
  
  **Late work and Make-ups:** There are no make-ups for daily assignments.
Late papers will be penalized by a half grade point for each day that it is
late.  
---  
**Absences:** Absences from class are not condoned except for medical
emergencies or authorized school trips. In either case a note **MUST** be
forwarded to me from the Dean of Student's Office explaining your absence.

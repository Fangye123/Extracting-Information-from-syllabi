**Required Texts:**

  * Burns, E. Bradford. _Latin America: A Concise, Interpretive History_
  * Allende, Isabel. _The House of the Spirits_ 

**Purpose:** This class is designed to introduce the student to the varied
histories and cultures of Central and South America, from the ancient native
civilizations through the European colonial period to the present. Because of
the limitations of the 15 week structure, this course can in no way provide a
comprehensive overview of this dynamic and complicated region. Therefore, this
class will stress chronological topics, examining as much of the social,
political, and economic policies unique to Latin America as possible, as well
as examining the region's unique art, literature, and culture.

In this course, students will be expected to synthesize these developments,
evaluate their importance, and trace the changes and contradictions that have
marked Latin American history. This course will provide students with an
overview of the major historical developments of the region through lectures,
readings, discussions, and writing. Emphasis will be placed on Cuba, Mexico,
Brazil, Argentina, and Chile, but all nations and peoples will be discussed,
as well as the role the United States has played in both helping and hindering
Latin American development. By the end of the semester, students will have a
solid understanding of the issues that have shaped current Latin American
culture, economic status, and political landscape, and the student should
leave this class with a better understanding of the Latin American experience
and possibilities for the future.

**Requirements:** This course will consist of two exams, various written
exercises, and tri-weekly quizzes. The exams will be a combination of multiple
choice, identification (short essay), and essay. The first exam is worth 25%
of the class grade, and the final is worth 30%. The final is not
comprehensive.

Quizzes are worth 20% of the class grade - students will take five quizzes
throughout the semester, and the lowest grade will be dropped. Quizzes are
usually multiple choice, but may also be fill-in-the-blank, matching, or short
answer.

The final 25% of the grade will consist of various written assignments and
discussion. Discussion activities will consist of a variety of exercises
(maps, overheads, worksheets, readings, films, written assignments, etc.)
throughout the semester. These exercises are not designed to penalize, but to
better familiarize students with lecture and text material. Most exercises
will be take-home assignments; usually typed, short essays. Although
attendance is not required, it is strongly encouraged as some in-class
material will go into much greater detail than the text. Students may also be
expected to participate in group assignments given throughout the semester.

The grading system will follow the standard A-F scale. The breakdown is as
follows; A: 100-93, A-: 92-90, B+: 89-87, B: 86-83, B-: 82-80, C+: 79-77, C:
76-73, C-: 72-70, D+: 69-67, D: 66-63, D-: 62-60, F: 59-0.

**Attendance:** Attendance is not required for this class. However, not all
quizzes will be announced, and students will be expected to participate in
class discussions. In addition, any changes in the class or syllabus will be
made verbally during the semester, and conforming with these alterations will
be the student's responsibility. And as most exam material will be derived
from the lectures, I would strongly recommend that you miss no classes.

**Withdrawal:** You should be aware that the history department follows a
separate add/drop schedule than the University. The final week to withdraw
from this class is week 10. IPs will be given only in extreme circumstances.

**Class Schedule:** Students will be given a separate list of reading
assignments from both the text and the required readings. I strongly recommend
you keep up in your readings to have a better perspective on the material
presented in class. Assignments and changes in the syllabus will also be
posted on the class webpage.

stupid question, so if anything is unclear to you, please do not hesitate to
ASK!

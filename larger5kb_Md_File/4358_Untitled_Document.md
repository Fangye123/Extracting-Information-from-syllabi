Grading will be based on three components: 40% for your building report (10%
for the "pre-summary"; 20% for the paper; 10% for the rewrite); 20% for the
midterm test; and 40% for the final examination. Both the mid-term and the
final will involve analytical skills as well as evidence of thought about the
lectures. A strong performance on the final examination and the building
report can improve weak grades on the mid-term. Please note that W
(withdrawal) grades are assigned by the Dean's office alone, not by
professors, and that I give G (incomplete) grades only for documented illness,
accidents, or emotional stress, and for no other reasons. There is no way you
can earn "extra credit" from me, and I don't raise grades after the final
examination for any reason other than mathematical error: the way to earn a
good or brilliant grade in this course is to start working on it now. This
course follows this Department's statement on academic integrity:
"Plagiarizing is an act that violates the Student Conduct Code, and will not
be tolerated in this class. Plagiarized assignments will result in a failing
grade for that assignment." Note that in the world of the Internet,
plagiarizing has gotten ever more easy: it is mandatory that the full URL
address be given for every website you draw upon for your research.  
  
Office hours and fieldtrip: I would enjoy talking with you in my office
(balcony of Frick Library reading room) on Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 12 noon,
and from 1 to 2 p.m.; or arrange other times by telephoning 648-2419. Also, my
e-mail address is ftoker@pitt.edu; I will quickly respond to questions you
leave for me there. In some past years this course has gone on special
fieldtrips--as far as Columbus, Ohio: if this interests you, just ask me.  
  
Readings: The text is G.E. Kidder Smith's Source Book of American Architecture
(see above). This is a brand-new departure for me, because it is not a
textbook. Students have several times asked for a "text" that would go in
greater detail on specific buildings. My lectures will thus be the text for
this course, but Smith is an ideal companion to the lectures, with his
excellent text and photographs: as you can see, nearly all the buildings I
will discuss in detail are in his book as well. ( You are responsible for all
"key works" from the lectures, whether they are in the text or not.) You
should buy Smith, and you may want to keep up with the lectures in Marcus
Whiffen and Frederick Koeper's American Architecture vol. 2: 1860--1976, which
is on reserve. There are also about two dozen other specialized texts on
reserve under our course number: you should consult them regularly as an aide
to a deeper understanding of the material than the main text can give you.

The building report  
HA&A 1531, like all my upper-level classes, has long had as one of its
requirements a term paper embodying original research. The topics on which
these papers are based normally exclude buildings in Pittsburgh or Western
Pennsylvania. This year, however, exactly the opposite is true: students are
free to write reports on any buildings in post-Civil-War America, but you are
particularly encouraged to write on local buildings. Reason? Your instructor
has been invited to write on the buildings of Allegheny County for a new book
called Buildings of Western Pennsylvania, one of 54 volumes in the Buildings
of the United States series, sponsored by the Society of Architectural
Historians. I have already covered 95% of these buildings in my Pittsburgh: An
Urban Portrait, back in 1986. But this forthcoming book has a different
orientation, more like your text by Kidder Smith. Students with whom I have
discussed this assignment thought it would have more appeal than the "usual"
kind of term paper; I believe they're right. This class will be credited in
general for any parts used in the final book, and students whose text is
especially professional will receive specific credit.  
  
Your assignment, then, is to write approximately 400 words (800 at the most--
that's two pages of computer doublespaced text, or one and a half pages in
Pittsburgh: An Urban Portrait) on a standing Allegheny County building--or not
in Allegheny County if you would rather work in some other region. Use the
Kidder Smith type of write-up as your guide. The write-up should describe the
building, show its interaction with its environment, connect it to the other
known works by the same architect, and give a critique of the building,
examining its special call to our attention. To get an idea of a typical
200-to-400-word entry, see the entries on Detroit buildings, pp. 63--122 in
Buildings of Michigan in the same series, on reserve. Note the high number of
"brand-new" buildings on the list below: these offer you the chance to put
your own mark on a building before any other writer.  
  
The paper is due in three stages: select topic buildings--first come, first
served--at any meeting up to and including September 22. (Note: as a locator
of "your" building, use the two maps appended at the back of the hard-copy
version of this syllabus, on reserve.) A one-page bibliography and "plan of
attack" (what I call the pre-summary) is due October 20: it will be handed
back to you on October 27, with comments. The paper is due on November 3, and
will then be corrected and sent back to you for a rewrite of no more than 200
to 400 words long, due December 1. This final paper will, of course, be handed
back to you, but it must be handed in with three "extras" that will not be
handed back: a clean copy, illustrations, and photocopies of your research
materials. The paper will not receive a grade without those three extras and a
proper bibliography (if your sources are, in part, oral, these must be
documented too.) Illustrations and photocopies of your research materials
ought to be handed in with the first paper, too, but they will be returned at
that time.  
  
Three further notes about the paper: all papers, early or late, must be
delivered into my hands or under my door on the Frick Library balcony only: I
will neither chase down nor give credit for papers that were supposedly mailed
to me or put in someone's box. Late papers will be penalized 10% for each week
of lateness, and none will be accepted beyond the last class lecture.  
  
Buildings for the building-report: here follow those currently under
consideration for Allegheny County: students are welcome to propose other
American post-Civil-War buildings within or outside of Allegheny County for
their reports: these will follow the same schedule as outlined above. The
abbreviations GT etc. are explained below. All the buildings or districts are
mentioned in Pittsburgh: An Urban Portrait except those indicted as not in
P:AUP. Students are especially encouraged to tackle the "tougher" entries:
those not in P:AUP and the multiple or "district" entries, such as Carnegie-
Mellon's campus. Besides the satisfaction of doing tougher work, students may
be assured that a decent job on a tougher entry will score as high or higher
in grading than a fine job on an easier entry.

Atlases and Plat-Books of Pittsburgh began in the 18th century but in their
printed form date from the later l9th century. Their titles may be found in
PITTCAT under "Pittsburgh -- Maps". Among the major series are the Warrantee
Atlas; Atlas of the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny and Adjacent Boroughs (l872
and later, by G.M. Hopkins); Real Estate Plat-Book (l896 and later); Insurance
Map of Pittsburgh (l924 on, published by Sanborn Map Company); Ward Books
(Pittsburgh Magazine Company, 1911, for each of the 27 wards).  
  
Miscellaneous resources in HILLMAN LIBRARY: The Archives Service Center
contains the University of Pittsburgh archives, certain specialized
collections, and the Archives of Industrial Society, including the City
Photographer collection (50,000 glass negatives, 1900 to 1960), histories of
numerous clubs, companies and churches, and biographical files. The most
important of these collections for Pittsburgh urbanism and buildings are the
Building Permit Dockets for Pittsburgh, 1878-1916. (The post-1916 permits are
in certificate form, and are reportedly housed in great disorder in the Bureau
of Building Inspection at the Public Safety Building, Downtown). The building
permit entries are by year, ward by ward, and detail the structure and cost,
owner and builder of all new Pittsburgh buildings of the period. The IAS has
the originals, but generally gives you microfilms to use.  
  
Miscellaneous resources in the CARNEGIE PUBLIC LIBRARY: In the microfilm
collection, second floor, are all city directories. Sanborn insurance maps of
Pittsburgh and all Pennsylvania available on microfilm for 1884 (partial);
1893; 1906; 1927; 1951. These show every building in the city, with detailed
plans of industrical complexes, labeled. The Music and Art Department, second
floor, has index-card drawers on the buildings of Pittsburgh: drawers 53, 54,
55 on architects, and buildings by institutional categories (e.g. churches) as
well as homes by owners names. The same department has three clippings files
on architects and prominent buildings.  
  
The Pennsylvania Department, second floor, contains the Pittsburgh Photograph
Library of thousands of large-format contact prints; full clippings files on
neighborhoods and buildings; a "biography index" of card catalogs that cite
prominent Pittsburghers in books; and a biographical clippings file on
Pittsburghers that is most useful in determining facts on buildings.  
  
Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional Historical Center, 1212 Smallman Street
in The Strip (tel. 454-6000) is the new shape of the old HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Its marvelous holdings include books, pamphlets, and
clippings on prominent Pittsburghers, neighborhoods, nearby towns, clubs,
factories, and buildings of all sorts. Here are the originals of hundreds of
atlases, plat-books, insurance maps, and city-planning maps that will give you
instant information on the development of the neighborhoods you are studying.
Some originals can be consulted, otherwise microforms. (Library open 10 to 5,
Tuesday through Saturday: as of press time they had not ruled on what they
would charge student visitors.)  
  
HSWP has a clipping file on subjects as well as a picture file on Pittsburgh
buildings; the Music and Art Department of Carnegie Library has a cross-
reference card catalog to articles about Pittsburgh buildings and Pittsburgh
architects, while the Pennsylvania Department of the same library has
clippings on buildings, streets and neighborhoods, in addition to the
Pittsburgh Photographic Library and slides of Pittsburgh.  
  
A major resource on standing buildings is the Allegheny County Survey of the
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, ca. 1978-1985. Survey files are
kept at PH&LF in Station Square, and list thousands of significant buildings
in the County, by neighborhood. Synopsis in Kidney, Landmark Architecture.  
  
  
The following are seven databases of great help to you. Three of these are
interactive from any computer on campus:  
-PITTCAT (University of Pittsburgh library holdings): see Frick Libary's excellent bulletins on how best to use this and other electronic resources  
-Getty architecture database, on Netscape at www.ahip.getty.edu

BASIC METHODOLOGY OF THIS COURSE:  
ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION, ANALYSIS, AND CRITIQUE  
  
The following is an outline of the personal methodology I have developed over
the years for dealing with buildings. I will use it, modified where
appropriate, for every building I discuss in this course. I will expect you to
use it too, not to give the "right answers" about architecture (there are no
right answers in this field, anyway), but to develop the strongest possible
arguments for positions that you take, in class, in your written assignments,
and on your tests.  
  
Six steps in architectural history. Description, analysis, and criticism are
the first three steps by which scholars or amateurs typically look at
buildings (or any works of art). It seems to me that there are six steps in
all:  
1) describe the building  
2) analyze it (show how it works both functionally and formally)  
3) create a provisional criticism (judgment based on "just looking")  
4) learn and incorporate facts of the building's history  
5) create a learned criticism (based on facts as well as personal reactions)  
6) expand into a theory of architecture  
  
Three definitions in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary may help:  
Describe: "To represent by words; to give an account of."  
Analyze: "To separate or resolve into elements or constituent parts. To
separate mentally the parts of (a whole) so as to reveal their relation to it
and to one another; as, to analyze an economic theory. To study the factors of
(a solution, problem, or the like) in detail, in order to determine the
solution or outcome."  
Criticism: "The art of judging with knowledge and propriety the beauties and
faults of works of art or literature."  
  
When you think about a building, and especially when you write on one, you are
effectively dividing your critique into three separate parts (in written work,
these should be indicated with subheadings):  
  
Description  
Analysis  
Criticism  
  
Let's look at the words description, analysis, and criticism in respect to
light. Recently I told my optometrist: "You know, my father was right: I can
read a lot better when my book is under a bright light."  
  
Dr. Morgan replied: "Of course: the pupil reacts to the bright light by
getting smaller. When smaller, it creates a lens that is much sharper than it
is when the pupil is wider. So you see better."  
  
My observation was mere description, though it was valuable: both art and
science begin with "mere" descriptions of phenomena. Dr. Morgan's reply was
analysis: he put each step in a logical sequence, and explained how things
work: he didn't just say what happened.  
  
Criticism does not typically take place in science, at least not as an
expression of preference. (Who would bother to say "Those cancer germs are
really yukky"?: western civilization presumes cancer is yukky to begin with.)
But there can be an expression of criticism, or judgment, on the consequences
of what you have just observed. You can say: "The new dormitory at UPittsburgh
has some excellent design features, but it falls down in terms of lighting.
Students are constantly reading in dormitories; hence the dormitory rooms
should have had bright lighting."  
  
Then you can insert history into this line of questions: historically, when
have people made good lighting available?, or, Why were dormitory lights
formerly so weak? Why is the typical light bulb in Italian hotels about 15
watts? (High electricity costs, I guess, but maybe there is some other
explanation: romantic atmosphere? proprietor doesn't want you to see that the
wallpaper is peeling?)  
  
Analysis and history feed on each other. When I got back to Pittsburgh from
Princeton in 1986 after renting my house to seven Finns for a year, I was
amazed to observe that numerous electric bulbs had burned out and had not been
replaced; every curtain had been removed from every window in the whole house;
and (to judge from what they left behind) the tenants must have kept burning
hundreds of huge candles--the kind that burn one full week. Clearly "light"
meant a very different thing to these Finns, who have midnight sun in the
summer and near-darkness at noon in the winter, than it did to me.  
  
Thus does light become an important factor in the history of architecture: you
cannot describe, analyze, critique, or write a history of Gothic, Renaissance,
or Baroque architecture without considering their use of, and cultural
attitudes toward, light.  
  
Finally, you are ready for a learned critique, which is a considered judgment
on a building or group of buildings in the light of its or their history. You
have looked at individual buildings and studied the history--including the
cultural history--of a certain group of people in history. You can now look at
their buildings the way they did. You are now looking culturally at light, not
just looking at it as a detached scientific phenomenon.  
  
Before jumping into architecture, practice by making a description, analysis,
criticism, history, and learned critique, using some field OTHER than the
history of architecture. The subject could be snow, for example. A description
would say: "It sure snows a lot in Buffalo." The analysis would be: "Yes,
because the air over Lake Ontario heats up and carries moisture with it, which
it then dumps on Buffalo in the form of snow when it reaches the colder air
over the lakeshore ground." What would the next steps in the sequence be?  
  
In architecture, the description gives an account of the building, stressing
its location, its scale, its materials, its interior space, and how people use
it: this is how the eye (or a videocamera) sees the building.  
  
Analysis is the point-by-point study of how architectural decisions (a term
defined below) using architectural components (another term defined below) to
make all the parts of a building work in relation to any other part. Buildings
do not just happen, in the manner of mountains or sandy beaches. They are made
to happen. Analysis does not merely ask "what happened?": it asks "why?".  
  
In describing the Capitol in Washington, you would report that the building
has a rotunda at its center and two wings, each with a large chamber.  
  
But when you come to analyze the Capitol, you would ask why the building was
laid out that way. Clearly, it is a symbolic as well as practical layout: the
Senate chamber on the north balances the House chamber on the south, just as
the two chambers "balance" each other in the process of making laws. The
rotunda in the center symbolizes the essential unity of the members of both
houses; in a practical way, it gives them a place to assemble together for
occasional great events, and also a place in which, theoretically, they can
meet the public. All of these observations you can make without knowing any
but the most obvious historical facts about the building or its function.  
  
As you learn more about architectural history, you would realize that the
rotunda recalls the Pantheon in Rome, and so part of your analysis would be a
discussion of the way in which the Capitol was designed to symbolize our debt
to Roman law and civilization. As you really dig into the subject, you will
understand still more architectural decisions: the fact that the Supreme Court
formerly met right in the basement of the Capitol (better--or just different--
symbolism from today, in which it now meets in a separate Greek-style temple).
Think also that the Capitol architect expected that George Washington would be
buried in the solid rock right below the rotunda: talk about symbolism! Think
about the way the Capitol, which, like the whole plan of Washington, is
precisely oriented to the points of the compass, acts as a microcosm of the
United States: you enter from the east, and the great vista stretching out for
two miles down the Mall is the (then) unexplored west. Architectural analysis
asks exactly those sorts of questions: Why did the architect designate certain
rooms in certain proportions and dimensions? Why did he or she designate
different kinds of light and space to different kinds of users and functions
in the building? You may not know the answers to these questions yet--some
answers will never be known--but analysis demands that you ask the most
profound questions.  
  
Criticism is a good deal more complex than merely finding fault, the way you
would criticize a roommate for spending too much time on the telephone.
Architectural criticism is a process of evaluating the success of the
architectural decisions taken years before. Your criticism should evaluate
your building in terms of both aesthetics and function. Are the textures weak
or lively? Is the building confusing or agreeable to walk through? (The way an
architect makes you go through a building is called a circulation path.) In
concluding with a criticism of the strengths and weaknesses of the building,
you must be judicious and informed, as best you can.  
  
Hint: criticism works best by comparison: why not compare your building to a
building of similar use elsewhere in town that you feel is stronger or weaker?
In writing this criticism the words "I" etc. should still not appear. Do not
merely express an opinion ("this boiler plant really turned me on"); you need
to convince your reader or audience to share your evaluation.  
Architectural components are all those things that go into buildings,
literally or figuratively. We have already encountered some of those
components above: function, symbolism, proportions, dimensions, light, space,
texture, circulation paths. Every building has changes in light levels (dark,
well-lit, or brilliantly illuminated areas); different kinds of circulation
(stairways wide or narrow; corridors public or private); and different
configurations of space (low- or high-ceilinged).  
The way an architect manipulates these and other architectural components are
his/her architectural decisions. Architectural decisions can be good, bad,
indifferent, or non-existent. (Did the architect decide that it would be fun
to hide the elevators in Forbes Quadrangle, or did the obscure location of the
elevators just "happen"?)  
  
You will find yourself listing architectural components in all three parts of
an architectural critique, but in different ways. In the description, you
might note that your building is made of bright yellow brick. In the analysis,
you would ask why the architect chose this kind of brick, and you might be
able to provide some answers, such as "to make this church stand out in its
neighborhood." In the criticism section, you ask whether that architectural
decision was good or not. (Yes, it made the church stand out, but is it ever
repulsive!)  
  
Other architectural components to consider are design, image, composition,
selection and handling of materials, color, relation to site, technology, how
the technology was exploited, the quality of the lighting, the plan,
circulation, use, and overall appropriateness of the building to its function.
Ask yourself, What kind of "statement" does the building make within its
setting? How do you approach the building? Does it "want" you to see it
straight on, obliquely, or in a combination of views (think of the Cathedral
of Learning). Which viewpoint seems to have been the main one in the mind of
the designer? How does the building change as you approach it? Does the
profile remain same, or change? What time sequence plays itself out? A
building's plan gives you the "approach" once you are in the building. It
encourages or prevents certain uses (circulation). Think of the plan of a
bank: it makes you go or not go in particular directions. Is the plan of your
building a compact block, or divided into parts? Can you guess the plan from
an exterior view of the building, or does it turn out to be different?  
  
Composition: what are the main parts of the building and how are they
connected, symmetrically or asymmetrically? Architects sometimes speak of the
parti (short for the French parti pris, or decision taken) of a building i.e.
its most striking aspect that you could sketch out in a second. Think again of
the Capitol at Washington and its distinctive three-part parti: even simple
structures have one too.  
  
Is the building "closed" or "open" to the exterior? What is the impression of
the building envelope?: mass (closed) or open (volume:--space that is enclosed
inside the building)? The thick-walled churches of Baroque Rome exhibit mass;
Japanese temples, with their light walls, exhibit volume. Other components of
composition include: size, shape, profile, color, materials, texture, rhythms
(bay divisions, horizontal and vertical flow), details and ornament.  
  
Symbolic meaning of the building, if any, would be an appropriate issue also.
You are not expected to get your hands on the memo in which the architect
wrote all this down years ago, but you are expected to make a reasonably
learned analysis of why you think certain architectural decisions were made at
the time.  
  
If written or spoken, it would be excellent if you accompanied your
architectural critique with a postcard or original photograph, and sketch
plans--nothing fancy or professional.  
  
Pulling together your observations. By this point you will have made hundreds
of observations, from the acoustical properties of your building to the
changing nature of its light. Now you need to organize these observations into
one coherent system. One of the most efficient ways to do that--I have learned
from experience--is to present your building as the product of five factors,
or agents of change. I use the acronym FACIT (Latin for "he/she/it makes") for
this sequence. The five factors are:  
function  
aesthetics  
context (physical and social/historical)  
ideology (the idea or theory behind the design)  
technology and structure  
  
  
Typically one can see these factors, or agents of change, at work. Anyone
walking through the Capitol while Congress is in session will understand what
the main function of the building is. An observer could figure out the
materials and building technology of the Capitol fairly well by simply looking
at it as a response to physical context (climate etc.) One could also make out
the aesthetic of the various parts of the Capitol: the sobriety of color and
plainness of texture of the oldest parts, and the gaudy decoration of the
post-Civil-War rooms. One would not need to know the historical timeframe for
the construction of the different parts of the Capitol--but you could guess at
it--nor the social context of those years to make those observations.  
  
What you cannot see is the historical context and the prevailing ideology of
America during the years in which the Capitol was first designed and later
added to. To know that, you would have to do extensive reading, not only on
the history of the Capitol but on the history of the United States. This data
you could not know from just looking at the Capitol: you need to consult
history books to find that out.  
  
To summarize the five factors:  
Function tells you what the building was designed to do. How is this revealed?  
  
Aesthetics: what presuppositions or decisions of taste were made when the
building was designed: rough rather than smooth; rounded forms rather than
straight; irregular rather than regular?  
  
Context. Ultimately, almost everything fits under the title of "context." The
first context is geographical (land and climate) and specific to the setting
of the building: urban, suburban, or rural; type of city or neighborhood etc.  
  
The second type of context is the temporal, social, and cultural context of
the building, as far as you can make it out. You can tell the cultural context
of a neighborhood by such signs as ethnic traits or lifestyle: is the
neighborhood clothes store a Brooks Brothers or a K-Mart? The cultural context
and even the physical context of a neighborhood may have radically shifted
with time, but architecture is like a portrait: what you see on the exterior
conveys something about the interior too.  
  
The five factors listed above, put together, will almost always explain why a
building turned out as it did. Some buildings, such as the Gothic-style
Cathedral of Learning on our campus, or Colonial-style supermarkets, are not
so much indicative of change but of resistance to change: an architectural
fashion that clung to Gothic or Colonial long after the original context for
those styles had died off. In those cases, we have a triumph of aesthetics
over technology: people can (and, perhaps, should) build in the contemporary
style, but they are not obliged to.  
  
Ideology: what mental image is propagated from the building just looking at it
on the outside? Or feeling it inside? Does the building convey the personality
of its patron? of its architect?  
  
Technology, insofar as you can see it: lighting, heating, cooling,
ventilating, plumbing, glass: what appears to make the building inhabitable or
visitable? This includes structure, insofar as you can judge: what holds the
building up, and how is this exploited for visual or even emotional effect?
Can you guess about the expense of the materials or labor conditions in
erecting the building?  
  
A note on writing style. Whether

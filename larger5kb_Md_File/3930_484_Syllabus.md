**Course Overview and Goals** :

Ornithology is the scientific study of birds and bird biology. Birds have
always been the objects of fascination to people, and many aspects of their
characteristics make them particularly well suited to careful study. Their
widespread distribution and diversity, and remarkable variation in natural
histories have made them the subjects for a tremendous number of scientific
inquiries. In this course we will cover the basics of bird biology ranging in
levels from a micro to a macro perspective. These include details of avian
cellular biology (genetics), individual structure (basic anatomy and
physiology, feathers and flight), life history strategies (foraging, annual
cycles, development), interactions (reproduction, communication, social
behavior), populations (ecology, demography), and larger considerations
(conservation, systematics).

Our primary goal is to introduce you as advanced students to the basics of
bird biology, and to learn the current and common techniques of scientific
study of these different topics. As one of the advanced biology courses, we
have an opportunity to exemplify and examine applications of the theories and
ideas taken from a number of other courses, such as ecology, conservation
biology, animal behavior, evolution, genetics, and developmental biology.
Thus, as one of our goals, we will expose you to some of the ideas advanced in
these other biological disciplines, and gain a more thorough understanding of
their applications in the context of avian systems.  
  
**Grading Policies** :

Grades will be computed using the following components:  

  * Class Exams (Three, including the final; 100 pts each or 300 points). 
  * Laboratory Exams (Two 100 pts each, or 200 pts) 
  * Occasional Lab quizzes (together equal to one exam, 100 pts) 
  * Field Notebook (100 pts). 
  * Research Project (200 total pts, 100 for final paper, 100 for preparatory work).  

  * Animal Diversity Species Account (100 pts) (Graduate Students do three)  
The Species Accounts are described in detail at:
http://animaldiversity.ummz.umich.edu.  
  
_Exams_ will be comprehensive, covering virtually anything we cover in class.
Emphasis, however, will be on the immediate preceeding materials.  
_Laboratory Exams_ will, likewise, be comprehensive, and can cover any
material from the laboratory sections, or in field sessions.  
_Lab Quizzes_ will be given usually during the beinning of the lab period, and
are designed to cover material from the most recent lab session.  
_Field notebooks_ will be required by all students. Details for what
information will be needed, and format, will be discussed in class/lab.
Notebooks will be collected and graded at announced times.  
Every student will be required to conduct a _research project_ during the
semester. The requirements will be divided into several components, each
graded separately. These include an initial proposal outlining the research
question and methods, a literature review, and a final paper written in
scientific journal format. This final paper will be subject to a review, and a
re-write by each student. All components of this research project will be
typed on a word-processor. Details will be discussed in class.  
There are 1000 possible points. Grades will be computed on a curve of the
person who achieves the highest point total. Ninety percent of this level and
above is the A range, 80-90% is the B range, 70-80% is the C range, 60-70% the
D range.  

**Attendance Policies** :

A course at upper-level with intensive content shouldn't need an attendance
policy; students should be motivated to participate without penalty or
prompting. To insure balanced treatment of topics and experience(s) in the
laboratory, _all weekly laboratory sessions and field trips are absolutely
required_. Absences will be excused only for legitimate reasons and with
advanced notice. Unexcused absences will result in a reduction in the final
grade of a letter-grade increment (for example from B to B-).

  
**Cell Phones** :

Out of respect for both the instructors and other students, cell phone use
(both outgoing and incoming) will not be permitted in class, lab, or field.
Please turn off cell phones and pagers at the beginning of each session.

**Field Guide Notes** :

I require that each student own a field guide to the birds of North America,
but list the Kaufman guide only as recommended. There are advantages and
disadvantages to each of the many guides available. The Kaufman guide has all
of the recent taxonomic revisions (to date), and is considered an introductory
bird field guide. Of the other available guides, the National Geographic guide
(Scott et al. 1999, _Field Guide to the birds of North America_ ) also has the
recent revisions, and is a slightly more "advanced" alternative. Any of the
other guides are acceptable, but note that you should be aware of changes made
in the species listings. The local Audubon should have all available and
reasonable guides in their Nature Shop (300 E. University Blvd.) if you wish
to peruse them. If you already own a field guide, that will suffice, as long
as you annotate it with the [ AOU taxonomic
changes](http://pica.wru.umt.edu/AOU/birdlist.HTML)  that have occurred since
it was published.

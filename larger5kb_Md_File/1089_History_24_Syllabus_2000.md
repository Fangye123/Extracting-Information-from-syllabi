**Course description:**  
** **  
This course will provide a chronological survey of European history from the
late Middle Ages to the present.  The course will emphasize the history of
ideas, including religious and scientific ideas, but considerable attention
will also be paid to social and political history.  A principal goal will to
be gain experience with close reading, discussion, and written analysis of
primary sources, and to learn how historians use such materials to understand
and interpret the past.

Class participation will include short in-class writing assignments.
Participation will be graded at the end of the course in whole grades (i.e.,
A, B, C, etc., with no plus or minus).  Grades for your reading journal and
participation will be based primarily on the signs that you show of having
given serious thought to the course materials.  In calculating your grade for
the course, I will give credit for improvement.  Feel free to consult me as we
go along about how you are doing.  
    
**Attendance:**  
** **  
Attendance is required at all class meetings.  As a courtesy, please inform me
of the reason for any absence (in advance, if possible).  Students who miss
more than four class meetings may be dropped from the course.  Since much of
the work for this course involves the close reading and discussion of assigned
readings, students who come to class unprepared will be counted as absent.
Late reading journals will be penalized one third of a grade for each day late
(i.e., an A will be reduced to an A-, and A- to a B+, and so on).  Incompletes
will be assigned only in case of documentable emergency.  
    
**Academic integrity:**  
** **  
All work in this course will be governed by the Academic Integrity Policies of
Austin College.  By enrolling in this course, you agree to inform yourself
about these policies and to abide by them.  Although you are encouraged to
discuss the course material with other students, the work you do in this
course must be your own.  In particular, when you submit your reading journal,
it must contain your own ideas in your own words.  Ideas or information that
you get elsewhere -- from a friend, a professor, a book in the library, or any
other source -- must be acknowledged specifically.  This is true even when you
are not quoting directly.  Paraphrasing someone else's ideas does not make
them your own.

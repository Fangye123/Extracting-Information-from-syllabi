This course will provide a general overview of the different aspects of
historic preservation, including downtown revitalization, neighborhood
organization, historic house management, preservation legislation,
preservation education and historic architecture. Much of the class is taught
in a laboratory atmosphere with students making on site visits to historic
preservation projects. Emphasis is given to the study of the development of
American architectural styles, so that students can recognize historic houses
and place them in a wider context.

arise in a wide variety of settings. Each student is to collect news clippings
related to preservation issues and projects from daily and weekly newspapers
and general circulation magazines. Each clipping should be identified as to
its source and date. Only original clipping should be submitted unless
permission to submit photocopies is given. DO NOT CUT ANYTHING OUT OF LIBRARY
MATERIALS . A minimum of ten clippings are required. Ten clippings will
receive 12 of the 20 points, each additional clipping will add one-half a
point.

significance in a ten-minute presentation, using slides, charts, or other aids
as appropriate. The members of the review board will ask questions and make
suggestions for improving the nomination.

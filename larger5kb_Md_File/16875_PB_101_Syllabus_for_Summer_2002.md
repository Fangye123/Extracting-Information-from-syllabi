* Reading Assignments: Chapter readings are in Stern. We wil be covering only portions of some chapters even though all the pages of the chapter are listed here.

**_General Instructions_**

1\. The syllabus is intended to be a PLAN for the direction of the course. We
may go faster in some sections, slower in others.

2\. Classes will be conducted in a lecture/discussion format. This means that
the instructor will guide you through the topics but YOU will be expected to
join the teaching/learning experience by participating in the discussion. The
following suggestions will help you to prepare for class:

  * SCAN (it isn't necessary to read every word at this stage) the textbook assignment BEFORE class, paying attention to the outline at the beginning of the chapter, headings, photos and diagrams (and their captions), and new words ( **boldface type** ). WHILE YOU SCAN, make a list of _questions_ you want to ask in class and some _answers_ to questions you think the instructor will ask. Make a game of this!
  * AFTER covering the material in class, READ that section in the textbook. You will notice that the instructor has skipped over some parts of the text and added material that is not in the text. CORRECT your notes and add to them as you read, remembering that the points covered in class are the important points for your learning.
  * consider this quarter as one in which you will be especially observant and inquisitive about the plants in your environment...then BRING YOUR OBSERVATIONS AND QUESTIONS TO CLASS TO ENRICH THE LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ALL OF US.

3\. PLEASE do not drop this course without discussing your situation with the
professor. Students often "push the panic button" before they have given the
professor a chance to help them.

4\. **WARNING:** STUDENTS WHO DO NOT ATTEND CLASS DO NOT DO WELL IN THIS
COURSE.

5\. COMING LATE TO CLASS AND THE USE OF ELECTRONIC DEVICES IN CLASS IS
DISRUPTIVE AND DISRESPECTFUL. Allow plenty of time to park and walk. Turn off
all electronic devices during class time.

6\. ALL ELECTRONIC DEVICES MUST BE TURNED OFF DURING CLASS OR SIGNALS TURNED
TO "VIBRATE" MODE. "Beepers" and ringing phones interfere with the learning
process.

7\. This is not a laboratory course. However, the Recitation sessions (topics
in italics in the Syllabus) will give you an opportunity to see the material
we have discussed in class. Recitation sessions are also an excellent
opportunity to review class material and get answers to your questions.
ATTENDANCE AT RECITATIONS IS REQUIRED.

8\. Midterm examinations and the final examination are REQUIRED. If work,
military duties, or some other events beyond your control force your absence
from a scheduled examination, YOU MUST MAKE ARRANGEMENTS IN ADVANCE. Even in
case of ILLNESS OR SOME OTHER EMERGENCY on the day of the examination, YOU
MUST NOTIFY DR. KRAMER (755-4344) OR OSU-M (755-4011) _BEFORE_ EXAM TIME.
**You may not take a make-up exam unless you have met these requirements.**

**_Grading_**

Grades will be based on the number of points earned. There are 500 total
points:  
  3 Midterm Examinations (100 points each) |

300  
  
---|---  
2 Laboratory Reports (25 points each) |

50  
  
1 Final Examination |

150  
  
            **TOTAL POINTS** | 

**500**  
  
 Letter grades are assigned only at the end of the course, not to each
examination. Each graded exam paper will show the number of points earned and
the student's rank in class, i.e., how many students scored higher on that
examination.

**_E-mail Communication and World Wide Web_**

 All students at Ohio State University have an e-mail address. If you are a
new student you need to go to the Conard Learning Center or Writing Center
(O-239) to "activate" your e mail account (there is **no fee** ). Or, if you
have access to the Internet, you can activate your account online: Just go to

**<http://www.oit.ohio-state.edu/userpass.html>**

Then, when you have questions about the "mechanics" of the course (e.g., "Will
the next exam cover photosynthesis?" or "Will you be having regular office
hours next Wednesday?") or the course content (e.g., "I'm confused... what is
the difference between pistil and carpel?"), you can ask your question in
class or send it to Dr. Kramer by e-mail! His e-mail address is
**kramer.8@osu.edu** . The plan is to establish a "bulletin board" system so
that student questions and instructor answers can be shared with the entire
class automatically.

There is a "homepage" for this course on the World Wide Web (WWW).  Go to it
regularly to check for announcements, study aids, etc.  The "Botany in
Cyberspace" link should be useful for many parts of the course, especially for
resources for your term paper research.

The Department of Horticulture and Crop Science maintains an excellent web
site of learning resources for H&CS 300 (a course with content similar to this
course):

<http://www.hcs.ohio-state.edu/hcs300/>

For a discussion of the WWW, see pages 10-11 of Stern's textbook and/or
comparable sections in other  
textbooks.  Several of the most successful textbooks for introductory plant
biology have web sites which would be interesting and useful to students in
this class:

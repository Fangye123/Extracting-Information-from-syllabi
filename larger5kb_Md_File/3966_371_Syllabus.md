**DESCRIPTION OF THE COURSE**  
According to the ECSU catalog, "This course provides an overview of rhetorical
theory and practice and engages students in critical (rhetorical) analysis of
literary and cultural works.  Participants in the class will explore the role
of rhetoric in the construction of arguments, the communication of ideas, and
the creation of knowledge."

Simply put, rhetoric is the intentional use of language or other symbols to
persuade or somehow influence others.  Our work in this course, then, will be
to build a greater understanding of the workings of rhetoric in our world, the
ways in which users of rhetoric (rhetors) design their words to do something,
and the systems which rhetorical theorists and critics throughout the history
of western culture have used to categorize and illuminate various rhetorical
strategies.  We will look at everything from advertisements to songs,
presidential speeches to grass roots social movements, war memorials to
television situation comedies in order to understand how so much of our world
is constructed in order to influence us in specific kinds of ways.  Our
ultimate goal will be to become more skeptical (though not necessarily
cynical) audiences.

**REQUIRED TEXTS**

  * Blakesly, David. The Elements of Dramatism. New York: Longman, 2002.
  * Crowley, Sharon and Deborah Hawhee. Ancient Rhetorics for Contemporary Students. 2nd ed. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1999.
  * Foss, Karen A., Sonja K. Foss, and Robert Trapp. Readings in Contemporary Rhetoric. Prospect Heights, IL: Waveland, 2002.
  * Hart, Roderick P.  Modern Rhetorical Criticism.  2nd ed.  Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 1997.
  * Herrick, James A. The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction. 2nd ed. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, 2001.
  * Various article handouts distributed in class.

**ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION POLICY**  
Students in this class are expected to read the assigned material and come to
class prepared to discuss and/or write about it.  We will be grappling with
complex ideas, the kind that are best understood through discussion, practice
and debate.  Lively discussions will be rewarding not just because they will
help us make sense of the material, but also because they will make class time
go by more quickly and pleasurably.  Therefore, our discussions and inquiries
during class will not lend themselves to simply "getting the notes from a
friend."   For these reasons, attendance and participation are key to the
success of every student.  If you must be absent because of illness or other
pressing circumstances, it is your responsibility to notify me (the same day
if possible), to consult with me in order to find out what you missed while
you were absent, and to immediately (upon your return to campus) hand in any
assignments due.

Because this class meets only once a week, **I can allow only one absence
before docking your grade for the course**.   For each additional absence,
your grade will be lowered one full grade point.  Therefore, if you received
A's on all your work for the course but miss class twice, your grade will move
from an A to a B.  If you miss three classes, your grade will be recorded as a
C.  Of course, I will consider making exceptions in the case of a real
emergency, but again, it is  your responsibility to request an exception as
soon as you are able.

It is also important to arrive in class on time.  When students arrive late
they disrupt activities that have already begun and take time away from other
students as the instructor gets them caught up on what is happening in class.

**Therefore, I will close the classroom door and take roll no more than five
minutes after class is scheduled to begin.   Once the classroom door is
closed, no more students will be allowed to enter the classroom.  Students not
in the classroom when role is taken will be recorded absent (unexcused).**  


**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**

  * **Weekly Quizzes (30% of final grade).**   I will give essay quizzes (sometimes take-home assigned ahead of time, sometimes in-class) almost every week in order to help me determine how well you are understanding the reading and class discussion.  These quizzes will often serve as cognitive warm-ups for class discussion, allowing you to draw on what you've written to share with the class.  Quiz essays will be graded on 1) how well you show a clear understanding of the reading, 2) how thoroughly you present your answer to the question, 3) how well you support your answer with specific references to the text in question.

  * **Analysis of a Traditional Rhetorical Text (20% of final grade).**   Due April 1.  For this 4-6 page, double-spaced, word processed paper, choose a traditional subject for rhetorical analysis (such as a speech, published essay, editorial, etc.) and examine the means of persuasion used by the rhetor to persuade his/her audience.  Your analysis should include:
    * an explanation of the social and historical context surrounding the rhetorical text or event you are analyzing
    * a justification for choosing this text (why this particular rhetor, rhetorical text or situation is worthy of study).
    * a rationale for the elements you chose to analyze. For example, you might choose to focus on the rhetor's rhetorical stance [ethos, pathos, and logos], his/her use of just one of these appeals if it is significant, or his/her use of stylistic elements such as figurative language or tropes.  Whichever approach you choose, you should explain why you think it is appropriate to this piece of rhetoric
    * analysis of the chosen elements and conclusions about their impact on the effect of the rhetoric.
Your analysis will be graded on 1) adherence to the generic requirements for
rhetorical analysis outlined above, 2) the depth and clarity of analysis, 3)
incorporation of rhetorical principles read about and/or discussed in class.
.  If possible, include a copy of your chosen text with your paper.  


  * **Analysis of a Non-Traditional Rhetorical Text (20% of final grade)**.   Due April 29.  For this 4-6 page, double-spaced, word-processed paper, you will analyze a non-traditional rhetorical "text" that you encounter in your everyday life.  This assignment is meant to help you see the rhetorical in the mundane stuff you encounter everyday.  It should help you to see how we are all influenced by rhetoric whether we realize it or not.  You may choose to analyze anything from a current popular song to the syllabus for your biology class.  Your job is to identify how this "everyday" text is rhetorical--in other words, what it does to influence its audience and how.  Do the lyrics of the song portray women as unable to control their emotions, thereby reinforcing old stereotypes that keep women from achieving?  Does the biology syllabus use language that paints the work of the course as fun and important to students' every day lives?  Or does it use elevated language and jargon to impress students with the importance and seriousness of the subject they are about to study?  Whatever claims you make about what this text does and how, you should support them with direct quotes or detailed descriptions.  The structure of your paper will follow much the same outline as that provided above for the analysis of a traditional text and be graded on the same criteria.  If possible, include a copy of your chosen text with your paper.

  * **Reflective/Analytical/Rhetorical Portfolio (30% of final grade).**   Due May 13.  At the end of the semester, you will turn in a portfolio consisting of five revised pieces of writing that you feel best represent your work in this course and your growing understanding of rhetoric and rhetorical theory, along with a reflective essay describing what you feel you've learned from your interactions with rhetorical theory and criticism throughout the semester.  Revisions of the two graded analysis papers can be among the five revised pieces for the portfolio and significant improvements can have a positive effect on the grades for those analyses as well as the portfolio grade. The other pieces for the portfolio will be drawn from quizzes and rhetorical exercises to be done in class throughout the semester.  In the portfolio, you should include the original quizzes or exercises along with your revised and polished versions.

Portfolios will be graded on 1) how clearly and fully you explain and/or
illustrate key issues and ideas, 2) how well you relate your
ideas/reflections/responses to class discussion and readings, 3) the depth of
your analysis, and 4) how well you polish, edit, and present your work
(eliminating spelling, grammatical, and other errors, and making the portfolio
easy to read and appealing).  
**ACADEMIC HONESTY:**  
Your _ECSU Student Handbook_ notes that plagiarism is an academic violation
and, therefore, punishable in a number of ways, including expulsion from the
university.   The 2001/2002 edition of the handbook provides the following
definition of plagiarism:

[P]resenting the work of others as one's own.  The "work of others" includes
any work bought or borrowed from another student as well as work copied from a
book, magazine, newspaper or other medium.  Complicity in another's act of
plagiarism is itself an act of plagiarism. (76)

Of course, you may make reference to the ideas and work of others without
penalty if they are clearly and accurately cited.

Be advised that I know that plagiarism occurs for a number of reasons--
frustration with the assignment, writer's block, laziness, poor management of
time, the interference of family and personal concerns in one's ability to
write, etc.  However, I will treat any case of plagiarism I discover (and
you'd be surprised how I might discover it) in the same way--by formally
charging the plagiarist with Academic Misconduct and giving him/her a failing
grade for this course.

**NOTE:**  
If you are a student with a disability and believe you will need
accommodations for this class, it is your responsibility to contact the Office
of Disability Services at (860)465-5573.  To avoid any delay in the receipt of
accommodations, you should contact that office as soon as possible.  Please
understand that I cannot provide accommodations based upon disability until I
have received an accommodation letter from the Office of Disability Services.
Your cooperation is appreciated.

**_RESEARCH_**

My research on the North American West focuses on the region's environmental,

**_TEACHING_**

My research perspectives influence my undergraduate teaching in courses on
Arizona and the Southwest, U.S. Environmental History, 20th-century U.S.
Western History, and early 20th-century U.S. History.

**_Undergraduate Courses_**

Undergraduates enrolled in my lecture/discussion courses and in my section of
396a will read a wide variety of primary documents along with interpretive
texts by historians.  Graduate students may enroll in 500-level courses; in
addition to participating in the undergraduate class lectures and assignments,
they will read additional monographs and join together in a separate
discussion section.

CATALOG DESCRIPTION

Supply and demand approaches to transportation planning. Land
use/transportation relationships. Function of travel modes, modeling local and
regional flows. Finance, politics and policy in transportation planning. 3
lecture-discussions, 1 three hour laboratory. Prerequisite: URP 337.

OBJECTIVES

The course is designed to provide you with knowledge and skills in urban
transportation planning. The focus of the course is transportation issues
likely to be faced by local jurisdictions, such as traffic impact analysis,
local access and circulation, and transportation/land use relationships.
Specific elements include:

* An overview of travel behavior theory, travel demand and supply interactions, and the capabilities and limitations of alternative transportation modes.

* The relationship of local area transportation planning to county, regional and state transportation planning.

* Traffic impact analysis, traffic mitigation responses and parking analysis.

* Travel demand management, local transit and non-automobile access modes.

* Transportation, land use and urban design.

* Planning and implementation strategies for local transportation plans--circulation element, financing strategies, ordinances, programs, etc.

* In depth knowledge of transportation planning issues in a community of your choice.

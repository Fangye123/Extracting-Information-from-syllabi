This course is an introduction to the study of politics and the discipline of
political science. It is strongly recommended for any further work in
political science at Wellesley. The course provides an overview of the
discipline and the four main subfields of political science:

  * **Political Theory** : the study of ideas about politics expressed by philosophers, political figures, and others from ancient to contemporary times;
  * **American Politics and Law** **:** the study of political and legal institutions and processes in the United States;
  * **Comparative Politics** **:** the study of political life in countries other than the United States (though it may also look at the U.S. in comparative perspective);
  * **International Relations** : the study of politics among nations and within the global system.

Course requirements include four graded assignments: two short papers; a take-
home midterm exam, and a self-scheduled final exam. They each count equally
toward the course grade. Class attendance and participation is very important
and will be taken into consideration in determining the final grade. Please
see the list of ["Responsibilities and Expectations"](resp.html) attached to
this syllabus.

The due dates for the written assignments are:

  * First short paper (5-7 pages): Monday, March 4th
  * Take-home midterm exam: Monday, April 1st
  * Second short paper (6-8 pages): Monday, April 22nd
  * Self-scheduled final exam: Tuesday, May 14th - Monday, May. 20th

For the three in-term assignments: You may have a total of one week (7 days)
of "extensions" from the due date to use throughout the term as best fits your
schedule. These extensions allow you to hand in a paper late without a grade
penalty, but after the 7 days have been used up the assignment will be marked
down 1/3 grade per day (or fraction of a day) late (e. g. from B+ to B).

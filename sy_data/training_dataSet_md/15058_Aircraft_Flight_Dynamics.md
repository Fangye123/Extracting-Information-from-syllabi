# Aircraft Flight Dynamics  
(MAE 331)  
Fall 2002

## Robert F. Stengel

Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering

Princeton University

MAE 331 is designed to introduce students to the performance, stability, and
control of aircraft ranging from micro-uninhabited air vehicles through
general aviation, jet transport, and fighter aircraft to Mars planes and re-
entry vehicles. Particular attention is given to mathematical models and
techniques for analysis, simulation, and evaluation of flying qualities, with
brief discussion of guidance, navigation, and control. Topics include
equations of motion, configuration aerodynamics, analysis of linear systems,
and longitudinal/lateral/directional motions. The course is required for the
aerospace engineering program, and it is accessible to all students with the
necessary prerequisites (MAE 206 and 222).

As presented in the linked _Syllabus_ , the course is divided in two parts.
About two thirds of the course will be devoted to the _Science and
Mathematics_ of flight dynamics, and one third will address historical _Case
Studies_ in aircraft performance, stability, and control. Principal references
are the draft manuscript for my book, _Flight Dynamics_ , and the book by
Abzug and Larrabee (1997), listed among _Selected References_. Assignments
will focus on the use of MATLAB for numerical experiments, on independent
investigation of the literature, and on analysis of real-world problems. There
will be a mid-term exam and a term paper. For the latter, each student will
analyze the flight dynamics of a different aircraft type, summarized in a
written report and a brief oral presentation.

**Catalog description:** Focus on learning how to use communications
technologies and develop related foreign language materials with an emphasis
on pedagogically sound integration of these technologies and materials in the
foreign language curriculum. Technologies to be explored include: presentation
software, interactive multimedia, the World Wide Web, and real-time
communication. Prerequisites: Advanced grammar and compositin courses in the
target language, CAP 100 or consent of the department.  (3 sem hr.)

This course will develop skills in using the tools of international
communications for today's global village.  Students will learn to use these
tools to create materials through projects directly related to the student's
individual language.  An adequate competence in the target language is
essential for success in this class, and students will be expected to work
with and create texts in languages other than English.  Examples of the
communications technologies to be explored include:  presentation software
(PowerPoint), the World Wide Web, real-time communication (voice and video
conferencing), software for digitizing media.  The course is intended for
language teachers wishing to incorporate electronic communications
technologies in their curriculum. Students should already know the basics of
word processing, email use, and WWW navigation.

made as early as possible.

**Course Description and Class Attendance Policy**

As electronic  communication in an international marketplace continues to make
the world seem smaller, it behooves us to develop the skills needed to
interact with people using these media across cultural and linguistic divides.
This class is designed to provide an introduction to and hands-on experience
with many computer and Internet applications that serve as adjuncts to
communication.  Students will learn to use these communications technology
tools to develop materials and projects directly related to their individual
areas of interest or major.  The course will be particularly useful for
language teachers wishing to incorporate electronic communications
technologies in their curriculum.

Students are expected to attend all classes and to be punctual.  Learning to
use all of these applications will involve much time, both in and out of
class. For this reason, students will need to make provision to work on
assignments and projects outside of class in addition to the regular
activities planned during class hours.  The course instructor will be
available regularly for consultation to assist students working on class
assignments and projects.  All students are urged to use the ICC computer
language lab or other lab facilities as well as home computers when
convenient.

**Assignments and Projects**

Students will be expected to complete weekly assignments, which will be
announced in class and also made available on a World Wide Web (WWW) page
developed for this class.  No text is required for this class; however,
several texts will be suggested by the instructors to serve as valuable aids
during project development.  Some readings for the class will also be on
reserve, and others will be available on the WWW.

Students will also be required to complete at least four mini-projects using
various communications technologies and applications learned during the
course.  (Please see tentative schedule above.)  In addition, students will
develop and present two major projects, one at mid-semester and one as a final
project.  These projects can be expansions of previous mini-projects and
should certainly be culminating projects using many of the technologies
learned to date.  Guidelines and evaluation rubrics for projects will be made
available to students in class and on the WWW page.

Evaluation:  | 1\. Class attendance and participation  | 10%  
---|---|---  
| 2\. Completion of weekly assignments  | 20%  
| 3\. Mini-projects  | 30%  
| 4\. Mid-term Project  | 20%  
| 5\. Final Project  | 20%

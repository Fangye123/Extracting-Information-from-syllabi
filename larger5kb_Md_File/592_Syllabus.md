how the state fits into the context of regional, national, and world history;
and the history of Las Vegas and gaming. When the course is completed:

2\. You should better understand Nevada's role in history generally, and the
role of world and national events in shaping the state, past and present.

your obligations as a citizen.  
4\. You should be better prepared for more advanced classes, at CCSN and
elsewhere.  
5\. Your abilities at critical thinking should be enhanced.  
6\. Your writing should improve.  
7\. You will improve your self-discipline through taking this class  
.8. You will learn the importance of meeting deadlines.

Required Readings  
(available at CCSN bookstores) James W. Hulse, _The Silver State: Nevada's
Heritage Reinterpreted_ (2nd edition, revised)  
Michael S. Green and Gary E. Elliott, eds., _Nevada: Readings and
Perspectives_  
Michael W. Bowers, _The Sagebrush State: Nevada's History, Government, and
Politics_

A few points need to be added about these readings:  
1\. You need not memorize material for discussion or in-class exams, but you
probably should read over the assignments at least twice; that will help you
digest the important information and the context in which it is presented.
While this class may be structured around your convenience, you still must do
the reading. Failing to keep up will hurt your performance in the class, and
while every semester goes by faster than you think, that is especially true of
the summer session.  
2\. Some reading material may be assigned more than once. This is to provide
additional information that will assist you with the essays. Also, you will be
able to coordinate the lecture topic with the appropriate chapters so that you
can read them in more depth. That does not mean that you will need to reread
every word of something when it is assigned a second time; it just means that
you should reacquaint yourself with it, and be prepared to use it in your
essay.  
3\. If the assignment says to read a particular chapter in any of thereadings,
that means the whole chapter.

Recommended Reading:Your books include bibliographies or lists of recommended
readings. You don't have to use these when writing essays for this class. You
are graded only on work dealing with material you have been given. You may
consult outside works if you wish. If a subject particularly interests you,
you are welcome to talk to me about it if you would like additional
information.

Grading Out of 300 available points, grades will be assigned as follows, with
+ or - given according to whether you are at the top or bottom of the scale:
285-300 = A  
250-259 = B  
220-229 = C  
190-199 = D  
270-284 = A-  
240-249 = B-  
210-219 = C-  
180-189 = D-  
260-269 = B+  
230-239 = C+  
200-209 = D+  
0-179 = F

You will accumulate the points by writing the following: 1\. Two essays, each
worth up to 100 points, for a total of 200 points. These will be similar to a
midterm and final, except that you will do them at home and have access to
course materials.  
2\. An analysis of the Nevada Constitution, worth up to 25 points. A format
sheet appears below.  
3\. An analysis comparing two websites on western and Nevada history, worth up
to 25 points. A format sheet appears below.  
4\. A summary and an analysis of visits you will make to two historical sites
or museums near you.  
Each assignment is worth up to 25 points. A list of possible sites appears in
the Musems link; if you live outside Las Vegas, you should consult me.

Grading Techniques You need to understand the following about how your essays
are graded:  
1\. You are graded on how you make your argument, not simply what you argue.
The evidence you present and how well you present it matters more to me than
whether you and I agree.  
2\. How well you write your argument affects how well you make it. This is a
college-level course, and you are expected to do college-level work. That
means using proper grammar, spelling, and punctuation. If you are a bad
speller or writer, take advantage of spell-checking and anything else your
computer offers, and various college services. Proofread anything you write
before you turn it in, or, if you are unsure about it, ask someone to
proofread it for you. Points will be deducted from your total score if your
work shows that you have not at least tried to do this.Extra-credit:You can
earn five points by writing a summary of a visit to a museum or historical
site (other than those for the assignment) or attending a forum or lecture.
Check with me first to find out whether you can receive credit.

Responsibility 1\. If you "disappear" without withdrawing or getting in touch
with me, you will get the grade you have at that time and it will go in your
record.  
2\. Responsibility involves meeting deadlines. If you turn in an assignment
late (or, given the nature of this course, it is postmarked late), you will
lose two points for every day it is late.  
3\. Some of you may be enrolled in high school and taking this class for
college or dual credit. This is a college class, NOT a high school class. If
you are enrolled in this course, you are considered a college student, will be
treated like a college student, and will be expected to exercise the
responsibility that this entails.  
4\. This class is set up so as to give you considerable independence. Do not
think this makes this course easier. Don't put things off!  
5\. It is possible that you have heard or been told that attending CCSN makes
you a customer or consumer of education. If so, the person who told you that
is wrong. You are a student. You deserve to be, and will be, treated with
respect. You are expected to do the same--to respect the class, the college,
and the professor.

Cheating/Plagiarism To plagiarize means to use all or part of another's work--
another's words and ideas--and call it your own, or quote another's works or
words without giving credit for it. You can and probably will be thrown out of
school if you plagiarize or otherwise cheat, and you will be failed or
withdrawn from this class. You certainly have the right to study with and talk
to other students, or anyone else whom you think might help you, and you are
encouraged to ask others to proofread your work if you think that will improve
it, but any work you turn in must be your own work.

The Nevada Constitution If you pass this course, you pass the Constitution
requirement. If you fail this course, you fail the Constitution requirement.
If you already have satisfied the Nevada Constitution requirement, you still
are expected to complete the assignment for this class.

**CRITICAL ISSUES IN CONSERVATION AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT**  
Fall 1998 Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:30 - 4:25 Room 14, Fernow Hall

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  

The purpose of this course is to establish a conceptual foundation for
analyzing and addressing practical conservation and sustainable development
issues from an interdisciplinary perspective. The course will generate insight
into the complexities of conservation and sustainable development by
highlighting diverse points of view and by examining various strategies for
achieving sustainability in different contexts. It will engage students in
both the inherent conflicts and potential compatibilities between natural
resource conservation and development for human needs. Principles will be
identified for effective interdisciplinary analysis of biodiversity
conservation efforts, natural resource management systems, and agricultural
production technologies by examining real-world issues in both the developed
and developing world. The course is oriented towards a graduate student
audience.

**COURSE FOCUS AND OBJECTIVES**

This course focuses on the intersection between people, biodiversity, and
rural land use at the ground level, with an emphasis on communities and
regional ecosystems. We will also discuss relationships between local
conservation and sustainable development and macro-level issues such as
government policies, population, and trade. Through lectures, discussion,
readings, and case study analysis, we will address the role of background
variables, processes, technologies, and projects in producing ecosystem and
human welfare outcomes at specific sites, with an emphasis on ways to achieve
incremental improvements in conservation and sustainable development.

The principal goals of the course are to broaden students' perspectives on
conservation and sustainable development and to gain experiences in group
problem solving.

Specific material to be covered in the course includes:

  * diverse concepts of conservation and sustainable development, and their inherent contradictions and compatibilities 
  * the relationship between indicators and processes for conservation and sustainable development, and the application of these concepts to case studies 
  * the complex relationships between population, land use, and conservation 
  * the importance of different levels of governance and action along the local to global continuum for conservation and sustainable development 
  * the complex relationships between people and ecosystems, including the conditions that lead to environmental degradation and those that lead to conservation 
  * issues, options, and technologies for sustainable agriculture, biodiversity conservation, watershed management, and protected area management 
  * identify and analyze conservation and sustainable development issues in everyday life and current events 
  * the causes of environmental degradation and the potential for conservation and sustainable development 

**COURSE FORMAT**

This three-credit course will meet twice a week for two hours. The class
periods will be a combination of discussion of conservation and sustainable
development issues, presentations by the instructor and guest speakers from
different fields, and group activities. Work outside of class includes
readings for each class period and four group projects. For the latter,
students will work in small, interdisciplinary groups to develop an
interdisciplinary framework for analyzing conservation and sustainable
problems and apply this framework in the analysis of three case studies. Each
case study will be discussed during a class period.

**ASSIGNMENTS AND GRADES**

Each student must: (1) Do the assigned readings and participate in class
discussions. (2) Participate with his or her group in the four group projects.
(3) Be the group leader or facilitator for one of these four projects. (4)
Serve as a discussant for one of the discussion sessions. (5) Contribute at
least two "found objects" (news article, product packaging, advertisement,
etc.) related to conservation and sustainable development to the class. (6)
Write a final essay at the end of the course. Grades (letter grades only) will
be determined based on attendance, participation, group project reports, and
the final essay .

**READINGS**

Students are expected to come to each class prepared to discuss the readings.
Two reading lists will be handed out, one for the first two course segments
and a second for the last two. **Two reading packets will be available from
Custom Publishing at the Campus Store.** Students are strongly encouraged to
purchase the reading packets. One copy of each reading will also be on reserve
in Mann Library.

**WEB SITE**

A syllabus, reading list, and assignments will be maintained on the Department
of Natural Resources web site: http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/courses/courses.htm

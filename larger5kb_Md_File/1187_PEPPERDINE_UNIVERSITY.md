Political Science 557  
Communist and Postcommunist Governments

Professor Caldwell  
January-April 1998

**Introduction**

> This course is designed to introduce students to the governments of the
former Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China and Eastern Europe. Since
1989, these governments have undergone profound changes; most notably, no
longer are all of these governments communist. Today, far-reaching reforms are
being implemented in the states of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Who would have thought less than a decade ago that the communist party would
no longer be a powerful force in the Eastern European states or that the
Soviet Union would no longer exist? Who would have predicted that the Berlin
Wall would be torn down and East and West Germany re-united?

>

> This is a particularly fascinating time to study these governments, for they
are in transition from over forty years of communist rule to an uncertain
future. The June 1989 massacre of students in Tiananmen Square and the tragic
events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Chechnya, however, are grim reminders that
conflict is still a part of the international environment.

>

> In this course we will focus on the history of the development and demise of
communism and the contemporary events in the communist and "postcommunist"
countries. We will utilize concepts from political science such as political
socialization, culture, development and modernization.

you may write the papers appears below.

should consist of an oral summary of the paper and should be from eight to ten
minutes in length. These presentations will be the principal source of

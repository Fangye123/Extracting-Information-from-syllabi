**COURSE OVERVIEW**

This course examines the tansformations in European society, culture, politics
and economic life from the end of the Napoleonic wars to the outbreak of the
First World War. Along the way we will consider such topics as the growing
strength of nationalism, the rise of mass political movements, the impact of
economic modernization on both individuals and society, the emergence of women
as political and cultural actors, and the ways that artists responded to the
social and economic transformation taking place around them.

The class sessions include a mixture of lecture and discussion (in which
everyone will participate). My lectures emphasize the principle characters,
events and trends. Our discussions will focus on the readings assigned for the
week and will also give you the opportunity to explore your own ideas and
opinions in much greater depth. These discussions also will emphasize why
things happened the way they did and how interpretations of the "why" have
changed over time.

**ATTENDANCE**

Because this course covers a great deal of material in just one semester,
attendance is absolutely necessary if you want to keep up and grasp the
essential points that I am making and so is a requirement of this course. A
significant portion of your grade is predicated on your participation in the
discussions that take place in class and so if you are not in class you cannot
participate. As a result, attendance is considered a part of your grade for
participation. Also, because the in-class discussions are a vital part of the
course, if you miss the discussions you will find yourself lost in later
classes (and on the examinations).  

* * *

**

COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

In addition to attending class, you must complete all the following
requirements. **Please note:** Any **** student who fails to complete all of
the assigned work will receive a failing grade for the course.

**Readings : **I expect you to do the readings assigned for each week
**before** that weeks classes begin, not after. My lectures assume you have
already done the readings and so if you have not already done the readings,
you may find that you are feeling a bit lost in class. Also, because we will
be discussing the documents assigned for that week, if you have not read them,
you will find it difficult to make an intelligent contribution to our
discussions.

**Required Texts** (all books are in the campus bookstore)

> Loubere, _Nineteenth Century Europe_  
>  Sperber, _The Revolutions of 1848_  
>  Taylor, _Bismarck: The Man and the Statesman_  
>  Morton, _A Nervous Splendor_  
>  Berenson, _The Trial of Madame Caillaux_  
>

requirements should contact the instructor to make necessary accommodations
(before September 15 please). Students should present appropriate verification
from Disabled Student Services, Dean of Students Office.

MEDICAL AND OTHER EXCUSES**

Every semester someone is forced to miss either an examination or the due date
for an assignment either as the result of an illness or a family emergency. If
you find yourself in this situation, fairness to all students in the class
requires the proper documentation, without which your excuses will not be
accepted. If you need to know more about this process consult me as soon as
the emergency is taken care of.  

* * *

  
**PLAGIARISM AND CHEATING**

In my courses all students are responsible for adhering to a certain standard
of behavior when it comes to honesty and plagiarism. I expect each individual
to adhere to these standards so that every member of the class knows that his
or her work is being held to an equal standard. If one student cheats, all
students in the class suffer. Even worse, however, is the fact that the
student who cheats is hurting him or herself. When you are cheating, you are
not learning and the reason you are here is to learn.

In addition to my own high expectations when it comes to academic honesty, the
University also expects students to demonstrate a high code of personal honor
when it comes to academic work. Please read the Texas Tech University
_Catalogue_ , p. 71, if you have any questions about what is expected of you
in this regard. Penalties for academic dishonesty are severe. If I have reason
to believe you have cheated or plagiarized another person's work,  I will
discuss this matter with you.  If our discussion does not result in proof that
no cheating or plagiarism has occurred, you will receive a failing grade for
that assignment or examination. If you have any questions about these
policies, please come talk to me in my office.

Writing Assignments**

Before you begin writing your papers, be sure to consult the [Student Guide to
Writing a Paper ](paper.html)that is included in this syllabus. Also, please
contact me whenever you have questions or concerns about these assignments.

**Essay #1:** Write an analytical essay of between 4-5 pages on one of the
topics listed below.   In addition to the Sperber book, you should consult the
various primary documents linked to this page in the course schedule for
September 29-October 1 and October 6-8.  These documents will provide evidence
you can (and should) use as you construct an argument in support of your
thesis.

1.  Which was more important as a cause of the Revolutions of 1848, social and economic conditions or nationalism?  You may choose to focus on just one state or to compare developments in several states.

2.  How and why did the Habsburg Monarchy survive the Revolutions of 1848?  Be sure to consider more than just military factors when constructing your argument.

3.  Argue either in favor of or against this statement: "The Revolutions of 1848 were a great turning point of history where history failed to turn."  You may choose to focus on just one state or to compare developments in several states.

This essay is due **October 13.**

**Essay #2:   **For the second paper assignment, write an analytical essay of
between 4-5 pages on any topic that appeals to you, so long as it remains
within the parameters of the course.  Before you begin writing, you **must**
submit a topic proposal to me that includes the following information:

1\. Title of the paper  
2\. Thesis statement  
3\. One or two paragraph description of the paper including tentative
conclusion(s)  
4\. Tentative bibliography

Papers that have not been approved by me in advance will not be accepted.
Obviously, I expect you to do some serious thinking about the paper **before**
you start writing, which means you cannot start on this paper on Saturday and
expect to hand it in on Tuesday.   As a result, during the semester you should
keep in mind that you have to write this paper and when a topic comes along
that appeals to you, come see me right away to discuss it.

This paper is due **December 3**.

**Late papers** : Late papers will be accepted. However, for each day the
paper is late, your grade will decline by 5% (one-half letter grade).
Remember, if you do not hand in a paper, regardless of how late it is, you
will not pass the course.

Internet Research Assignment**

With each passing day, more and more historical information is being made
available via the world wide web.  The many documents linked to this syllabus
are evidence of this expanding resource for historians.  Some of this
information is invaluable while other material that appears on the web is of
questionable provenance. This assignment is designed to give you a taste of
what is available out there and some of the problems that may be associated
with that material. You should look upon this assignment as fun, not a chore,
so let your imagination be your guide as you surf around looking for something
usable.

To complete this assignment successfully, you must locate an historical
document relevant to our course (i.e., from the 19th century and somehow
connected to Europe) that comes from a web site **not** listed in this
syllabus and forward it to me via e-mail. Before sending me the first document
you find, consider carefully whether you think this document is a valid
primary source, i.e., one you could cite in a research paper. If you have some
doubt as to the origin, completeness or authenticity of the document you are
looking at, find a new one. This assignment is due **October 9**.

**A word of warning:** do not consult the various on-line encyclopedias for
this assignment.   They are secondary sources, **not** primary sources.

THE EXAMINATIONS**

Each examination will follow the same format. The mid-term will have one
essay, one short answer and several historical identifications. All of the
historical identifications will be drawn from the list of terms I write on the
board each class period. The final will have two essays (one of which will be
all inclusive and the other of which will be limited to those topics covered
since the mid-term), one short answer and several historical identifications.
I do not ask multiple choice questions on my examinations.

OFFICE HOURS**

My office hours are on Monday and Wednesday from 2:30-4:00 in Holden Hall,
room 133. In addition, I am in my office almost all day on Monday, Wednesday
and Friday and so we can generally arrange a time to talk that is mutually
convenient if you cannot stop by during my posted hours. I can also be reached
at home after 8:00 a.m. and before 9:00 p.m. (my wife's name is Susan and my
telephone number is available from directory assistance). We have very young
children at home, so if you call after 9:00 you will invariably wake them,
causing unhappiness on our end. You are also strongly urged to contact me via
e-mail at [tkelly@ttacs.ttu.edu](mailto:tkelly@ttacs.ttu.edu).

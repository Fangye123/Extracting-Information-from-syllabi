## Course Description

This course investigates the roles of parties in historical and contemporary
political life in the United States. Its foci include:

  * the organizational structures of American party organizations and their development, 
  * the relationships between American political parties and the electorate, 
  * the relationships between Americal political parties and various institutions of government, 
  * nominations processes, and 
  * campaign finance. 
Additionally, we will on numerous occasions throughout the course discuss
theories of political realignment. Most variants of realignment theory theory
treat American political history as shaped by successive _party systems_ , or
periods in which the structure of partisan political competition remains
relatively stable. Punctuating these stable periods are _realigning periods_ ,
or periods of shorter duration during which political competition is less
structured and coalitions more fluid.

Because this course presumes general familiarity with the processes and
institutions of American government and politics, all students should have
passed (or be undertaking concurrently) PSC 121 or an equivalent college-level
course at another institution. Political Science majors and minors who have
not already passed PSC 202, "Political Argument and Reasoning," should be
taking it concurrently this semester. PSC 202 is _not_ prerequisite, however.

## Books

Students should purchase or otherwise obtain copies of the following books.
They have been ordered through the Orange Bookstore, and copies should be
available there.

  * Beck, Paul Allen and Marjorie Randon Hershey, _Party Politics in America_. 9th ed. New York: Addison-Wesley Longman, 2001. 
  * Maisel, L. Sandy, ed. _The Parties Respond: Changes in American Parties and Campaigns_. 3d. ed. Boulder: Westview Press, 1998. 
  * Ferguson, Thomas. _Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. 
Additional readings may be distributed in class, on the web, and/or placed on
reserve in Bird Library.

## Course Requirements

The instructor expects each student to come to class prepared to discuss the
materials assigned for that session. Class sessions will be held in two
formats. Sometimes, the instructor will lecture. At other times, the
instructor will moderate student discussions of the reading materials.
Lectures will not simply review the reading material. They will also present
material not included in the readings, but related to them. _Students who read
the materials but do not come to class and students who come to class but do
not read the materials should not expect to receive a passing grade._

### Examinations

Students will write three examinations, on the dates listed in the Course
Schedule below. All exams will be cumulative, but all will focus upon the
materials most recently assigned. _The lowest of the three examination scores
will not be used in calculating final grades._ Scores on the two remaining
examinations will be weighted equally. Because the lowest examination score
will be dropped, the instructor will provide _no makeup examinations_.
Students who do not appear for an examination will receive a zero. Since this
will be the lowest grade, it will not be used in calculating the final grade.

### Simulation

During the semester, our class will participate with Professor Kersh's PSC
305, "Legislative Process and the US Congress," in a political role-play
simulation involving the construction of party platforms and candidate issue
positions, distributions of campaign funds, political reportage, and
Congressional elections. PSC 311 students will be roles as lobbyists, party
officials, and candidates (challengers). PSC 305 student roles are lobbyists,
reporters, and candidates (incumbents). Parties will devise platforms and
support candidates, lobbyists will dole out money to candidates and parties,
candidates will seek financial support. The reporters will keep us all
informed of all these activitues. In culmination, we will simulate a
Congressional election. Students who perform particularly well will be
recognized with awards at the Political Science Awards ceremony at the end of
the semester.

### Simulation Reports

Each student will prepare two short (two to five pages) written reports
related to the simulation exercise. The contents of reports and their due
dates will vary, depending upon the student's simulation role, as indicated
below:

  * **Candidates:**
    * _First report:_ Opposition research and campaign strategy statement. Due February 21. 
    * _Second report:_ Midcampaign strategy revision statement. Due March 19. 
  * **Party officials:**
    * _First report:_ Party platform or justification of disbursements. Due February 7. 
    * _Second report:_ Retrospective evaluation of party performance. Due April 9. 
  * **Lobbyists:**
    * _First report:_ Report on lobby issue positions. Due February 14. 
    * _Second report:_ Retrospective evaluation of expenditure effectiveness. Due April 9.  

## Grading Criteria

  * Examinations (60%). 
  * Simulation reports (30%). 
  * Attendance and participation (10%).

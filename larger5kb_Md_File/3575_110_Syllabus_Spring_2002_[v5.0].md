A philosophy of education is a set of beliefs you hold about
children/students, about their development and learning, and about teaching.
Your beliefs about how children/students learn will influence your choice of
learning activities in your classroom. Your understanding of your role as a
teacher will influence how you interact with students on a daily basis.
Whether spoken or unspoken, your beliefs influence the type of teacher you are
and the environment you create in your classroom.

This project is designed to provide an opportunity for you to reflect on your
beliefs (your philosophy) about the nature of teaching and learning and the
roles of children/students and the teacher in the classroom. Please carefully
consider and discuss your personal beliefs. This is not a test of your

roles of teachers, students, parents and the community. Your philosophy will
influence the decisions you make as a teacher; your interactions with
students, parents, and colleagues; and the environment you create in your
classroom.

As you respond to the questions listed below, discuss the beliefs that are
most important to you that are likely to influence the decisions you make as a
teacher. It is more important to discuss the varied beliefs that you hold than
to provide an extended discussion of each belief. Please remember this is not
a test of you knowledge! It is a discussion of the key beliefs that you
predict will guide your decision-making as a teacher.

Type your response to each question. Attach a cover sheet with your name,
major and class status (freshman-second semester, etc.). Submit two copies of
your philosophy to your instructor and insert a third copy after the
iPhilosophy of Educationi tabbed divider in your portfolio. Please put the
date on each copy of the philosophy. Each time you are asked to write a
philosophy, add it to your portfolio, but do not remove previous philosophy
statements.

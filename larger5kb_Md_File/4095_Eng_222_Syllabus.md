**Course Rationale:**   222 surveys British literature from the early 19th
century through the late 20th century.  While we cannot possibly do an
exhaustive job of treating the three major literary genres (we do some justice
to the novel and poetry but very little to drama), we will be discussing at
least some representative works from each of the major movements and periods.
Because this is a survey course, it makes no pretense to thematic unity.
Rather, some lectures will touch on the broad spectrum of literary,
historical, and intellectual issues out of which this literature emerged;
others will zoom in on the literary works under discussion for the week.  

* * *

  **Requirements:**   There are four major requirements comprising 90% of your
grade:  **a midterm essay exam (25%)** , **two 5-7 page critical essays (20%
each)** , and **a final essay exam (25%) [**For sample exams from previous
semesters, follow the links below].  The due dates for these are marked in the
syllabus below.  Topics for the critical papers will be distributed in class
(and made available on this website) 2 weeks before the paper is due.  In
addition to these, 10% of your final grade will come from your participation
during class discussions and from your grades on the **quizzes** , which will
be given usually on the first day of discussion of the novels.  Attendance at
all lectures and active participation in class discussions are absolutely
essential to success in this course.  Please take comprehensive notes on your
reading and have all reading assignments completed by the day on which they
are due to be discussed.  Online links to exams and paper topics from this
page will be password protected.  The ID and password to allow you access to
these will be announced in class.   One of the purposes of this online
syllabus is to point you toward websites which provide additional information
about writers, about writing essays, and about literary theory. You may also
email any of your instructors with questions about paper topics and tests. If
you have questions about getting started on a paper, you can help us help you
by providing us with a thesis paragraph and asking us to respond to it.
General grading guidelines for the critical papers can be found
[here](http://www.public.asu.edu/~dbivona/papers.html).   **N.B. We expect
that your papers will conform to ASU guidelines on academic honesty. That is,
we expect that all work is your own except for that which you have explicitly
cited on your "Works Cited" page. This means you must cite ideas and words
borrowed from online sources as well as from books and articles found in the
library. If you have further questions about this policy, see the statement
issued by the Women's Studies Program
[here](http://www.asu.edu/clas/womens_studies/honest.htm). It provides a
succinct summary of the policy in effect in this class.**   If you are
interested in a readable introduction to basic theoretical issues, start by
taking a look at [John Lye's Literary Theory: An
Introduction](http://www.uwm.edu/people/jat/THEORY.HTM) and the [Glossary of
Literary
Theory.](http://dev.library.utoronto.ca/utel/glossary/headerindex.html) For
links to sites that offer help with rhetorical terms or with mythological
background, see [Starting Point for Literary
Research.](http://www.kingsu.ab.ca/~angela/literary.html) Essays written for
this class should conform to the conventions set out in the [MLA Format and
Citation Guide.](http://atl46.atl.msu.edu/fall/citation.html) You may find it
useful to consult a writing handbook. The following three are currently
available on the Web: [Elements of
Style,](http://www.columbia.edu/acis/bartleby/strunk/) [Online English
Grammar,](http://www.edunet.com/english/grammar/) and [Able Writer: A Rhetoric
and Handbook.](http://www.odu.edu/~jpb/ablewriter.html) You should also make
use of a dictionary such as the [WWWebster
Dictionary.](http://www.m-w.com/dictionary)   You should be familiar with the
website for [ASU's Hayden Library.](http://www.asu.edu/lib/)  For useful
general sources of information about literary topics consult the following:
[Literary Resources Page,
](http://www.english.upenn.edu/~jlynch/Lit/)[Encyclopedia Britannica (ASU
only),](http://www.eb.com:180/) and [Voice of the
Shuttle.](http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/) For online literary texts try these
sites: [Modern English
Collection](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/modeng.browse.html), [The Online
Books Page](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/books.html), and [Literature Online
(Chadwyck-Healey; ASU only).](http://lion.chadwyck.com/)  The latter database
is also useful for keyword, phrase, and line searches of British and American
poetry, British drama, and some fiction (the online fiction collection of this
database is presently rather small).  You may also find the [British History
Timeline](http://www.britannia.com/history/time1.html) a useful source of
historical information as well as the [Encyclopedia of British History,
1700-1930](http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Britain.html) **[New!]**.
While there is not much online literary criticism currently available, you may
find the  [IPL Online Literary Criticism](http://www.ipl.org/ref/litcrit/)
site, [Literary Criticism on the
Web](http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Crete/9078/index.html), and [Project
MUSE](http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/) useful (the latter has full-text articles
from such important literary journals as _New Literary History, ELH,_ and
_Modern Fiction Studies)_.  

  **Books (Required Reading):  **    Damrosch et al., _The Longman Anthology
of British Literature_.   Vol. 2. (Longman).    Shelley, Mary.
_Frankenstein_.   (NAL).    Bronte, Charlotte.  _Jane Eyre_.   (Norton).
Wilde, Oscar.  _The Picture of Dorian Gray._ (Oxford).     Forster, _E. M.

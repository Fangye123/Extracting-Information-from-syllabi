Fall 1996

This seminar will briefly review the historical course of American foreign policy and examine the position of the United States in the international system after the cold war as well as consider the current debate over the country's appropriate role in the future. Substantial attention will also be given to American institutions and processes as they pertain to foreign policy.

The first part of the course will concentrate on common reading and weekly discussions. An outline of topics and required readings are included in this syllabus. All participants in the seminar are expected to do the reading in advance and take part in the discussions.

Simultaneously, students need to do preliminary work on their research projects and meet the requirements specified on the "Research Project Design" attached to the syllabus.

During the second part, each student must make an oral presentation of his or her paper in class, and each must act as a discussant and critic of another's paper. Each presenter is asked to assign and place on reserve a brief reading germane to her paper. Some class time will be devoted to the problems of designing these projects.

Grades will be based on participation in seminar discussions, written assignments, oral presentations and critiques, and final papers.

All required reading is on reserve at the Graduate School's Mina Rees Library, and the books are stocked at Barnes & Noble Bookstore, 18th Street and Fifth Avenue. In addition, a "Coursepak" in which are bound all of the periodical and excerpted chapter readings is available for purchase from the Reserve Librarian in the Mina Rees Library.

Political Science U861.1/United States Foreign Policy - 8 Fall 1996

Research Project Design

As part of the requirements of this seminar, a research project must be designed and completed. Each participant should confer individually with the instructor concerning his/her project. In addition, we will devote some class time to a discussion of the problems of devising research projects, with a focus on the specific work of the students in this course. The process of designing the work will be facilitated by breaking the endeavor into discrete assignments, as outlined below.

1. Identify the problem to be investigated.

Within the context of this course, identify a topic or an area of investigation that you would like to examine. Your project should have two characteristics: it should be theoretically interesting, and it should be researchable. Submit a one-paragraph statement of the problem by September 26.

2. Prepare a preliminary bibliography.

Prepare a brief preliminary bibliography and a description of the materials to be researched, including

A. three items of conceptual or policy literature that treat the problem (one of these should be an article or chapter that may be assigned to the rest of the class for reading in preparation for your oral presentation); and

B. a description of the materials to be researched, including documents and other primary (direct, first hand) sources.

Submit this document by October 10.

3. Devise a conceptualization and hypothesis.

Submit by October 31 a one-page conceptualization of what you plan to study and your hypothesis. A conceptualization is a clear statement of your topic in the form of an idea or concept. A hypothesis is a succinct statement of that which you wish to explain--the dependent variable--and its causes--the independent variables. In addition, a hypothesis should include a statement of the logic of the causal inferences you wish to make.

4. Confer with your discussant.

Meet a week ahead of your presentation with the discussant of your paper and inform him or her of the main ideas you plan to present.

5. Make oral presentation.

Present in class your research proposal and a preliminary report on the results of your project. To be scheduled.

6. Write and submit final paper.

Prepare a final written paper of not more than 20 double-spaced pages by the end of the semester.

7. Pick up graded paper.

Papers will be returned with comments and grades, to student mailboxes, within ten days after their timely submission.

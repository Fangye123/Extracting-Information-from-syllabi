This quarter we will try accessing class materials in the Collaborative
Virtual Workspace [
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perrolle/CVW/index.html](http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/perrolle/CVW/index.html).
There the readings will be in the library on the first floor and class notes
will be in the gNUclassroom on the fourth floor. Each student group will have
a room on the top floor.

Exams will consist of short concept identification and brief essay questions
based on letures, readings, and group discussions. You should be able to
define and explain each concept using a good example. Midterm and final exam
questions will be covered in your group asignments and in class.

The midterm will cover part 1 of the course; the take-home final will cover
parts 2 and 3. Questions will be distributed in class Friday May 25.

Your grade for participation will be based on your contributions to the class
and to your group. (You will have an opportunity to recommend group members
who have been particularly helpful or hardworking).

Topics and Readings **

**Part 1. Software and Social Structure: An Introduction to Computer-Mediated
Social Interaction **

We will begin by considering how software is used in and produced by social
structures. We will then explore how programs mediate (come between) people in
social interactions and can distort the process. We will consider how
normative, economic and coercive power appear as individuals negotiate their
electronic identities and gain access to computer resources. We will discuss
the balance between individual freedom and social control of behavior in
computer and communications systems.

History 1311 is a survey course of World Civilization from the dawn of
civilization through the Protestant Reformation.

_

Required Reading_ :

The following is the text required for this course. It is available in the
bookstore.

Anson, Miller, Bilsky, Hanson. _A Brief History of Civilization_ (2 nd
edition)

**Optional** : _A Civilization Primer_ (5th edition) (for individuals with
limited background

in the social sciences)

_Hammond's Historical Atlas

_

**_

Examinations_ :

**

1\. **Brief Papers:** Each student should submit 12 one-page typed (or
equivalent length in clear long hand) answering _one_ of the questions that
follow the reading selections in the text or the single question that
accompanies each of the map exercises (Note that the map questions have
multiple parts, each of which must be answered). Answers to the questions
**_must**_ be based on the material in the reading, not on the introduction to
the reading, nor the textbook narrative, nor on outside sources. Moreover, all
statements of fact based on the reading need to be referenced in the paper.
This can be done simply by listing a page reference (i. e. p. 107) or the
source =s own internal numbering system (i. e. Ham. 208; Gen 8:15) after the
statement in question. No formal footnotes are needed. Students are expected
to do their own papers; no group efforts. Papers must be handed in either
before or on their due date; no late papers will be accepted. Papers, however,
may be turned into the History Department office before the office closes for
that day, or may be mailed (postmark date must be on or before the due date),
or e-mailed to me on or before the due date (before midnight central standard
time) (not faxed). Papers that are turned in after class, e-mailed, or mailed
must have, in addition to the student=s name, the section number of the class
in which the student is enrolled (failure to list section number will result
in a an automatic deduction of two points). Papers turned in during class do
not have to have a section number. Turning in papers after class, e-mailing
and mailing of papers is for the convenience of students who have commitments
that may keep them from attending class. The instructor takes no
responsibility for such papers, if they are lost. This is especially the case
with e-mailed papers, which sometimes do not reach their destination. Make
certain that you copy yourself so that you have a record that the paper was
sent before the deadline. Students are also responsible for picking up their
papers in a timely fashion. Missing papers not reported as missing within a
week of the return date, cannot be resubmitted. Moreover, challenges to the
grading of papers or the midterm will not be accepted more than a week after
the return date. Keep all returned papers in case of any later discrepancies.

2\. **Midterm and Final** : There will be a midterm and a final examination.
The midterm and the final will consist of a first section devoted to
identifications about which the student will write a brief paragraph. There
will be some choice among these identifications. The second portion of the
exam will be devoted to one or more essay questions. A group of potential
essay questions for the midterm is attached to this syllabus; the essay
questions for the midterm will be drawn from these. Students are encouraged to
think about these questions as soon as the material relating to specific
questions has been covered. Students may turn in practice essays, thesis
statements, outlines of possible answers to essays, in advance of the exam.
These will be handed back to the students with written comments; no grade will
be recorded. Final exam questions are also attached. The final will be
cumulative.

**_

Class Attendance_ :** Class attendance is required; the student is held
responsible for all reading assignments and for all material covered and
announcements made in class. Everyone is expected to be present at the time
class starts and remain until it is dismissed. If for great and good cause you
are either late or have to leave early, please enter or leave quietly and as
inconspicuously as possible, i. e. do not walk across the front of the room.

**_

Make-up Exams**_ : There will be no make-up midterms or papers. Each student's
four lowest paper grades will be dropped before the final computation of
grades. If the midterm exam is missed the midterm component of your final
grade will be added to that of the final (the final will then be worth 50% of
the final grade). No incompletes will be given unless approved by me _prior
to_ **December 17, 2001.** Moreover, incompletes will only be given when
circumstances beyond the control of the student prevent the student from
completing _part_ of the course requirements. Incompletes cannot be given for
the entire semester's work. Moreover, all completed work counts; an incomplete
is not a substitute for a failing grade. Finally, History 1311 cannot be taken
on a credit/no credit basis, or pass/fail basis.

_

General Regulation_ : Final grades will be computed on the following basis:

50% for brief papers (four lowest paper grades will be dropped)

20% for the midterm (will be dropped if student scores higher on final; 20%
then added to weight of final)

30%(or 50% if midterm dropped or missed) for the final

All testing and final grade computations on the basis of:

90 - 100% = A | 60 - 69% = D  
---|---  
80 - 89% = B| 0 - 59% = F  
70 - 79% = C  
  
(Grades will not be curved)

**_

DISABILITY SUPPORT SERVICES**_ \- It is the policy of UALR to accommodate
students with disabilities, pursuant to federal law, state law, and the
University's commitment to equal educational opportunities. Any student with a
disability who needs accommodation, for example in seating placement or in
arrangements for examinations, should inform the instructor at the beginning
of the course. The Chair of the Department offering this course is also
available to assist with accommodations. Students with disabilities are also
encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Support Services, which is
located in the Donaghey Student Union, Room 105, telephone 569-3143.

**_

CHEATING**_ \- No student may gain undue advantage over his/her classmates by
deceptive or dishonest means (as defined in "Cheating", Student Handbook, p.
30). Anyone who engages in such activity will receive an "F" in the course and
will be turned over to the Academic Integrity and Grievance Committee for
University disciplinary action.

**_

GRADING QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS**_ \- Students with questions or complaints
about the grading of their papers or exams should write out what the problem
is and hand it in after class. This is the forum in which such matters are to
be handled, not during class, nor during office hours.

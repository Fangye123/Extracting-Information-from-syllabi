    HST 383 presents an interpretation of the historical experience of the diverse nations native
    to North America.  The course will take an ethnohistorical approach, spending as much time
    on how native peoples have seen their history as on western academic understandings of the
    Native past both before and after contact with Europeans beginning in the 15th century. 
    Some emphasis will be placed on the formation and operation of United States government
    policy regarding Native Americans in both the 19th and 20th centuries.
    
    In addition to addressing important issues in Native American history, other goals of HST
    383 include:
    
    1. Prepare students for public life (voting, community service, etc.) by acquainting them with
    the current professional understandings of American history.
    
    2. Introduce American students to the social and cultural foundations of their own times so
    that they may understand themselves better.  Assist non-American students to better grasp
    American life and civilization.
    
    3. Build the intellectual capacities of students by encouraging critical thinking and analysis,
    thereby making them more fit for whatever career or life they choose.
    
    4. Improve the writing skills of students by offering them opportunities to write and receive
    feedback on what they have written.  
    
    These goals are interrelated and make the study of history part of a complete and useful
    college education.

    In addition to specific materials assigned in this syllabus or in class meetings, you are
    encouraged to make use of the SOU library.  Of particular value are the following reference
    items, all in the reference section:
    
          Dictionary of the American Indian (1990)
    
          Encyclopedia of Native American Tribes (1987)
    
          Encyclopedia of World Cultures (1991-94)
    
          Native North American Almanac (1994)
     
          Dictionary of American History (8 Vols, 1978) 
    
          Encyclopedia of American History, ed. Richard B. Morris (1982)  
    
          The Oxford Companion to American History (1966) 
    
          The Reader's Companion to American History, eds. Eric Foner and John A.
                 Garraty (1991)  
    
          The National Atlas (1973)  
    
    
    Course Method
    
          HST 383 is a combination lecture, reading, and discussion course.  Discussions will
    take place in two ways: the first in the traditional class setting, and the second by using the
    campus computer USENET "Newsgroups" system.  The campus news group for this course
    is: SOU.hst383.  News groups work like an electronic bulletin board: messages on the topic
    at hand are posted and read by all.  Responses to postings should follow as naturally as in
    conversation (except they should be prepared with a bit more care).  All students will be
    required to participate in the computer discussions.
    
          Additional instruction and explanation on this method will be made in class.  But if
    you are not already familiar with either the WWW or the news group systems, see the
    instructor.  Both the "Web" and USENET are extremely common features of the larger
    Internet and are becoming common in the work place.  You will need to be familiar with
    them before you graduate.   
    
    
    Examinations
    
          There will be an in-class midterm examination scheduled for February 13th, and a
    take-home final examination to be distributed March 13th and due March 19th.  Both will be
    in essay form.  The final exam will deal with themes developed throughout the course of the
    term.  
    
    
    Ethnohistorical Sketch
    
          Each student will prepare an ethnohistorical sketch of an aboriginal North American
    nationality according to detailed instructions to be distributed later.  Source materials for
    these sketches will include anthropological and ethnographic reports, oral histories, folklore
    and literary studies, and historical materials of an ethnographic nature.  In consultation with
    and approval of the professor, students must chose the subject nationality by January 30th. 
    Because materials may need to be ordered by interlibrary loan, students must begin work the
    their projects immediately upon approval.  Completed sketches must be between 2500 and
    3000 words.  Papers with more than three spelling, typographical, or grammatical errors will
    returned, ungraded, for correction.
    
    
    Grading
    
          The following is a breakdown of your course grade:
    
                       Midterm examination              100
                       Final examination                200
                       Ethnohistorical Sketch           200
                       Discussion                       100                
    
    
    The professor does not rely upon the arbitrary (though traditional) 90, 80, 70, etc. percent
    method of equating points with letter grades.  Improvement demonstrated throughout the
    term will be strongly considered.  Grades will also be based on the meaning of those letters
    as indicated in the Fall Term Class Schedule (p. 13):
    
          A = Exceptional accomplishment
          B = Superior 
          C = Average 
          D = Inferior
          F = Failed 
    
    Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading.  Please understand that high
    grades are earned not given. You start with nothing and you build your grade from the
    bottom up rather than being "marked off" from the top down.  A student's "usual" grades in
    other courses have no bearing on his or her grades in this course.  Likewise, grades one
    student receives have no bearing on grades assigned to another.
    
    No grade better than a "B" will be given for work that does not represent exceptional
    scholarly achievement.
    
    Students do not have the option of failing to complete a course assignment as outlined in this
    syllabus for a lesser grade.  All assignments and examinations must be completed before a
    grade will be submitted to the registrar at the end of the term.  An "I" grade will be
    submitted only after consultation with the professor and the completion of a written
    agreement on what is to be done to fulfill remaining course requirements.  In lieu of such an
    agreement, a grade of "X" ("no basis for grade") will be submitted.
    
    Students are advised that though the professor takes grades very seriously, he nevertheless
    considers them to be of little importance compared to learning and thinking about the history,
    culture, and civilizations of the American West.   
    
    
    Office Hours: Office hour times are listed at the top of the first page of this syllabus.  If you
    cannot meet during posted times, see the instructor for an appointment.  Please note: In
    order to avoid interrupting students who come during office hours, the instructor will not
    receive phone calls during those times.  You can leave a message at any time by phoning and
    waiting for the voice mail system to activate.  E-mail is the best method for contacting the
    professor.
    
    
    Other Items of Note:  
    
          1. Lectures and other course meetings are open only to students who are properly
          registered in HST 383.  It is the responsibility of each student to verify such
          registration.  No unregistered person will be allowed to attend lectures or other course
          meetings without the written consent of the instructor.
    
          2. Lectures are provided for instructional purposes only and remain the intellectual
          property of the instructor.  Other uses are prohibited.  Lecture material is covered by
          copyright (Title 17 U.S. Code).
    
          3. Lectures and other course meetings may not be tape recorded without the
          instructor's written consent.  Consent will be granted only in cases where the student
          is physically unable to take notes by hand.
    
          4. Students are expected to adhere to all the rules and regulations of Southern Oregon
          State College regarding conduct and academic honesty.
    
          5. Students must take care to avoid plagiarism (copying the words or ideas of others
          without giving proper credit to make them seem as if they are one's own).  The best
          way to avoid plagiarism is to put everything in your own words.  You may quote
          others, but you must surround their words with quote marks (or set them off in
          indented blocks), and you must indicate the source of the quote.  Quotes should be
          short, and they should be of such a character that rephrasing in one's own words
          would do injustice to the sense, significance, or impact of the projected quote. 
          Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and will not be tolerated.

Advanced Placement Biology




AP Biology is designed to be the equivalent of a college
        introductory course for biology majors. It is a rigorous, comprehensive course
        that provides the conceptual framework, factual knowledge, and
        analytical skills necessary to deal critically with this rapidly
        changing science. As outlined by the College Board (see below), the
        course is divided into three major units: Molecules and Cells (25%),
        Heredity and Evolution (25%), and Organisms and Populations (50%).

Graded
Course Requirements

Students' semester grades are based on the total number of points accumulated
relative to the total possible points that could have been earned.  Points
are earned in the following ways:



      6 Major tests (100 pts each); these will be modeled after the CEEB's AP
      Biology Examination in both format and scoring.
    


      2-3 Formal 
      Laboratory Reports (50 pts each).
    


      Periodic homework assignments (10-25 pts each).
    


      Fall semester Final exam (25% of semester grade).
    


An automatic "late credit" grade (maximum of 60%) will
be awarded to assigned homework that is completed after the due date except in
cases of timely completion of work missed unexpectedly as for illness. 
Otherwise, it should be noted that assignments are due on
the date assigned and that when planned absences (athletic trips, early
departures for or late returns from vacations or breaks, etc.) cause a student
to miss class when the assignment is due, the assigned work is still due on the
due date (or before) to avoid the late penalty. Late major assignments
(papers, etc.) will be penalized 10% per calendar day. 
Students taking a test after it has been marked and returned to
the class will not benefit from any scaling adjustment that might have applied
to that test. Students knowing in advance that they will miss a test (for
athletic trips, doctors appointments, etc.) should make arrangements to complete
the test before the absence occurs or before the tests have been scored and
returned.  Do not expect or depend on opportunities for
"extra credit," although there may be a few opportunities of this
nature from time to time.  
For additional details, please see the
course Handbook that you received at the beginning of the year.

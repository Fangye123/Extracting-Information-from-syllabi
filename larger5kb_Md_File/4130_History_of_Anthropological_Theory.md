Course Objectives:

**

This course provides a broad survey of anthropological theory. It is designed
to acquaint the student with the philosophical and historical background of
anthropology as well as different schools of thought and analysis within
anthropology. The course is divided into four parts. The first of these
examines the various fields of knowledge crucial to the emergence of modern
anthropology in addition to the anthropology of the Victorian period. The
second part examines culture theory in the early 20th century. A third section
deals with culture theory at mid-century and the final portion explores
contemporary theory.

**

Course Requirements

**

Lectures and Seminars:  This class consists of a series of lectures and
seminars.  In general three lectures alternate with one seminar.  At seminars,
students are expected to briefly present their ideas about theories and
theorists and lead discussion on these subjects.  Each student will be
assigned one of the seven seminars, and must participate.  Under each seminar
on this syllabus, I have listed a series of thought provoking, humorous, or
irreverent questions.  Students may elect to use these as starting points for
their discussion.

Papers: The course requirements are four **descriptive** papers, three
**integrative** papers.   Except as discussed below, all students must do the
same integrative papers.  Each student will be assigned four specific
descriptive papers.  One of these papers will be identified as the student's
seminar assignment.  Please note that seminar papers are to be identical in
style, subject, and substance to other descriptive papers.  As discussed
below, students may elect not to do all requirements.

**Grading:

Students will be graded according to their choice of the two systems listed
below.

**

Plan A: Students write all seven papers, participate in a seminar, and receive
an attendance grade. Each paper is worth 100 points and will be averaged to
produce a final score that will be graded according to the following scale:

A= 100%-90%  
B= 89%-80%  
C= 79%-70%  
D= 69%-60%

Plan C: Students will be graded on two integrative and one descriptive paper,
and seminar participation. Students must do the first and the third
integrative papers, and the descriptive paper corresponding to their seminar
assignment.  In exchange for this lightened work load the grading scale
becomes more difficult. Grades in Plan C will be averaged and graded according
to the following scale:

A= 100%-95%  
B= 94%-90%  
C= 89%-70%  
D= 69%-50%

Note that failure to turn in an assigned paper automatically places you into
the Plan C option.

**Warning-** Plan C reduces your workload but makes getting an A or B more
difficult.

**

Attendance Policy

**

Role will be called at the beginning of every class. If you are on Plan "A",
you will be rewarded or penalized according to the following schedule.*

perfect attendance = 2 percentage points extra credit  
1-2 absences = no penalty  
3-4 absences = minus 3 percentage point  
5-6 absences = minus 5 percentage points  
6-10 absences = minus 10 percentage points  
more than 10 absences = a final grade of F

If you are on Plan "C," the only attendance requirement is that you be present
on the day of your seminar assignment.  Failure to attend on that day will
result in a seven point deduction from your final grade.

*added to or subtracted from your final percentage

**

Other Policies:

**

_Late integrative papers_ : I expect integrative papers to be handed in by 5
pm on the day they are due. Late papers will be accepted but will be penalized
ten (10) points for each day they are late. Unless you have an excused
absence, Plan "A" students MUST attend class on the dates that papers are due.
If you hand in a paper but do not attend class, you will be penalized five (5)
points on that paper.

_

Late descriptive papers_. Descriptive papers are due in class. LATE
DESCRIPTIVE PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED FOR HALF CREDIT.

Papers will be graded based on the following criteria:

C: indicates a satisfactory performance that avoids serious errors and
demonstrates a basic command of class material. Positive qualities include the
presentation of a central idea that is adequately developed and competently
organized. The errors to be avoided include serious flaws in the construction
of paragraphs and sentences, in the selection of appropriate words, and in the
use of conventional written English. Writing style is generally clear.

B: surpasses the C paper by demonstrating a higher level of effectiveness in
the organization and development of a central idea. It shows greater
complexity of thought and development, and goes beyond the rote recitation of
class or book material. It has few or none of the common errors in the use of
conventional written English. There is clarity of expression and the writing
style is generally polished.

A: indicates outstanding work. It is clearly superior to the B and C papers.
It shows originality of thought and imaginative competence in the development
of the material. It engages and holds the reader's attention and invites
rereading. The writing style is consistently fluent, polished, and
distinctive.

D: indicates an unsatisfactory performance. It is flawed with one or more of
the following: weakness in establishing or developing the assignment; serious
errors in sentence or paragraph construction; serious errors in grammar,
spelling, or the mechanics of written expression.

F: indicates an unacceptable performance. It is flawed by one or more of the
following: failure to follow the assigned topic; failure to conceive, state,
or develop the assignment; serious repeated errors in sentence construction or
paragraph development; serious repeated errors in grammar, spelling, or the
mechanics of written expression.

STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS:

_

Students with special needs (as documented by the Office of Disability
Services) should identify themselves at the beginning of the term. The
Department of Anthropology is dedicated to providing these students with
necessary academic adjustments and auxiliary aids to facilitate their
participation and performance in the classroom.

This syllabus, like everything else, is subject to change.

Did Boas truly invent a scientific anthropology?  Was Boas guilty of the very
things he accused the evolutions of?  Could American anthropology have
survived without Boas?  What are some of the positive and negative aspects of
the Boasian heritage.  Was Boas right to reject the idea of race as a valid
unit of analysis in anthropology?  Can you truly be culturally relative

underlying similarities and differences between Functionalism and Culture and

Course description:  The various economic, social and cultural processes
associated with "globalization" are thought to challenge anthropology in
profound ways, problematizing both the construction of the anthropological
"object" and our relationship to it.  Accordingly, we are supposed to adopt a
range of new strategies and theories.  We cannot, Michael Herzfeld has
quipped, rely on participant observation in hermetically sealed localities
while "the villagers themselves are busily commuting to the city" and
"tracking old friends through the communications highway" (Herzfeld 2000: 6).

Korea poses just such a challenge to anthropology.  Developing across 5000
years of oftentimes tumultuous history--particularly during the 20th century--
Korea is a highly globalized nation that is simultaneously, recognizably
Korean, i.e., both global and local.  Examining Korea in historical and
contemporary contexts forces us to develop notions of modernity and
globalization that are less rooted in Western experiences, less tied to single
lines of "development."

Accordingly, we begin with an exploration of "tradition" and "change" in
Korea, analyzing the tensions between 5000 years of history on the Korean
peninsula combined with the rapid-fire, revolutionary change over the last 100
years that has positioned South Korea as a major force in the global economy.
Next, we will consider Korean life as part of a larger process of
globalization.  Economically, politically, culturally and transnationally,
South Korea is connected to other countries in the world system.  By examining
the sometimes disastrous interpenetration of South Korea and the United
States, we will explore the relevance of South Korea to our evolving
understanding of globalization and identity.  Finally, we will discuss the
problems and logistics of studying, working and living in South Korea,
contextualizing those difficulties in a dialectic of power and culture.

On our way to anthropological understanding, we will use a variety of
materials: ethnographies of Korean culture and social life, movies, comics,
television programs, magazines and newspapers.  No previous knowledge of
Korean language or culture is needed!

graded assignments:

participation  
In order to help us work through the sometimes difficult material I've
assigned  
in this class, students will be responsible for at least two (2) book reports  
on selected class readings over the course of the semester.  Book reports
should  
be approximately 10 minutes in length, summarize content and suggest critical  
inroads for subsequent class discussions.  At the end of the presentations,
students  
should hand in a print copy of their comments.

homework  
Since the final project is an in-depth discussion of some aspect of Korean
life  
in the context of globalization, students should begin collecting material  
(e.g., newspaper articles, magazine advertisements, interesting webpages)  
for their final papers as soon as possible.  Every Monday, students should  
hand in one, relevant "item" pertinent to their semester research projects.

final project  
Based on class readings and materials, students will write and present a paper
on  
some aspect of contemporary Korean culture in the context of globalization.

final examination  
A short answer test evaluating your knowledge of class readings and your  
ability to apply ideas from class lectures and discussions.

notes  
1.  Although exams and graded work will remain as stated above, I may have to change different readings or films on the syllabus throughout the semester.  I will, in any case, try to give you ample warning of any syllabus changes. 

2\. Each student is expected to be familiar with the University=s rules
regarding cheating and plagiarism (Towson University Undergraduate Catalog,
Appendix F).  Neither will be tolerated in my class and will result in a
flunking grade.

3\. Students with learning disabilities should register at the Disability
Support Services Office.

explanation of grading  
Following department policy, students will be assigned a letter grade without
a qualifying A+@ or A-@.

A: A superior performance surpassing assigned work in unique and novel ways
and  
integrating diverse ideas from a wide range of sources in addition to those
discussed in  
class.

B: Excellent work surpassing the expectations of the assignment and
demonstrating initiative  
and a willingness to move beyond the basic requirements of the assigned work.

C: Satisfactory work meeting all basic requirements of the assignment.

D: Work in some way less than satisfactory.  Although conforming to basic
requirements in  
some way, the completed work is nevertheless not a coherent response to the  
assignment.

F: A profoundly unsatisfactory performance which doesn't meet  
the intent of the assignment at any level.

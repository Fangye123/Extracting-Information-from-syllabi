### Description

_World Politics_ provides an overview of the field of international relations.
It is neither a review of contemporary international history nor a discussion
of current events. Rather, we survey a variety of perspectives, frameworks,
theories, and hypotheses which help to make sense of both history and current
events. Topics to be covered include state sovereignty, power and hegemony,
foreign policymaking, armament and disarmament, peacekeeping, international
political economy, international law, and war and morality.

This is primarily a lecture course, but class discussion will allow for
further exploration of the most interesting and controversial topics. In
addition, students will have the option of participating in an internet-based
diplomatic simulation as representatives of a particular country. This
exercise requires that you to put into "practice" some of the elements you
learn from lectures, discussion, and reading.

_World Politics_ is one of ten foundation courses in the [General Education
Program's](http://www.gened.american.edu/) Curricular Area 3, "International
and Intercultural Experience." You may complete the two-course sequence by
taking one of following second-level courses:

  * GOVT-434, London Semester (Study Abroad) 
  * SOCY-225, Contemporary Arab World 
  * IBUS-200, The Global Marketplace 
  * HIST-225, Russia: Past and Present 
  * HIST-260, To Arms: People and Nations at War 
  * SIS-215, Competition in an Interdependent World 
  * SIS-372, Brussels Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * SIS-375, Berlin Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * LFS-200, Russia and the United States 
Each of these courses explores in more depth a topic introduced by _World
Politics_. You can enhance the learning experience of this foundation course
by further study in one of the areas you find most interesting.

  

### Requirements and Evaluation

Course grades are based in part on a midterm (20%) and a comprehensive final
(30%) examination. These examinations consist of questions requiring both
short answers and longer essays. Part of your course grade will also be based
on your attendance and participation in class discussion (15%).

There are two options for the remainder of your grade (35%). The "paper
option" requires that you do the supplemental reading assignments and that you
write two short [papers](papertop.html) based on these readings and some
limited outside research. Paper topics will be of your own choosing, as long
as they are approved by the instructor, and each paper should be 5-6 pages in
length. The "simulation option" requires that you prepare for and participate
in a diplomatic simulation conducted over the internet with students from
other colleges in the U.S. and abroad. Preparation for the simulation includes
the submission of one 5-6 page team policy paper (in two parts), which will
require some outside research on the country you are representing in the
simulation, and a 2-3 page "debriefing" after the simulation concludes.

  

### Reading Materials

Readings are assigned from the following course books, available at the
[Campus Store](http://www.bookstore.american.edu/):

  * [ _International Relations_](http://www.american.edu/goldtext/jghome.htm), third edition, by Joshua S. Goldstein. Longman, 1999\. 
  * _International Relations in a Turbulent World_ , A _Foreign Affairs_ Custom Anthology. 

In addition to the text and the supplemental anthology (for the "paper
option"), you should be reading, on a regular basis, the [_Washington
Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/), the [_New York
Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/), or some other newspaper with thorough
international coverage. Your performance in the course will reflect your
familiarity with current international issues, and not just an understanding
of lecture and textbook materials.

  

### Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized possession of
examinations, and alteration of grades or markings on returned work. These and
other forms of academic dishonesty are discussed in AU's _Academic Integrity
Code_. If you are in doubt especially about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
or collaboration, please consult me. Any examination or assignment tainted by
academic dishonesty will automatically receive a _grade of F_. University
regulations _require_ that the incident be reported to the Dean of the School
of International Service, who will determine the appropriateness of further
disciplinary action.

## SIMULATION INFORMATION

The diplomatic simulation conducted by Project ICONS -- **I** nternational
**Co** mmunication and **N** egotiation **S** imulations -- at the University
of Maryland. Participants assume the roles of foreign policy makers and
negotiate via online conferencing on behalf of the nations they represent.
This semester we are representing [ China and India](teamss99.html). You will
grapple with such problems as the international debt crisis, human rights
violations, north-south relations and development issues, arms control, the
balance of trade, nuclear proliferation, and global environmental concerns.
The exercise proceeds in [three phases](phases99.html):

  * Phase 1: **PREPARATION** (1 February to 28 March)  
During this initial phase, you become familiar with the scenario and spend
time researching your country's positions on the key international issues
identified. You will also acquire the computer skills necessary for
participation.  

  * Phase 2: **SIMULATION** (29 March to 30 April)  
During this five-week period, country-teams exchange messages, participate in
multilateral conferences, and update their own policies and negotiating
strategies in response to developments in the simulated world.  

  * Phase 3: **DEBRIEFING** (1 May to 3 May)  
This short phase involves a review and self-assessment of your participation
in the simulation. You may revisit the sequences of messages in an effort to
analyze the strengths and weaknesses of particular series of negotiations.

More information about the simulation is available from the [Project ICONS
homepage](http://www.icons.umd.edu/). See especially the
[scenario](http://www.icons.umd.edu/current/univ/scenario/99sprun.htm) for the
Spring 1999 International System simulation. Other information on the ICONS
homepage will become relevant after we begin the simulation. Any computer
linked to the internet and running a web browser, which includes those at AU's
computing labs, will be able to connect to the ICONS simulation computer.

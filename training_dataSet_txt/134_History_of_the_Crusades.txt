COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES: The Crusades are one of the most
generally recognized phenomena of the Middle Ages, yet their importance
as anything else but a failed example of religious enthusiasm is not nearly
as well understood. This course will introduce the student to the crusading
movement between 1000 and 1300 as an important facet of a broad movementof
European encounter with other civilizations and societies as it was manifested
on several frontiers, and which prefigured the Atlantic routes into Africa,
Asia and the Americas. Students will study themes of cultural diffusion,
conquest and colonization within the context of interactions between the
competing societies of western Europe, eastern Europe, northern Africa
and west Asia.

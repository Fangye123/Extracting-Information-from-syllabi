## 2\. Background to Course

**

> Prerequisites:**

>         1. EDP 502 or a comparable course, exposure to graphical methods for
describing data, summary statistics, regression and correlation, the logic of
statistical tests and familiarity with simple tests such as t-tests for
assessing differences between means.

>         2. Previous experience with computer use (or an ability to rectify
the deficit quickly).

>         3. Previous work in epistemology or philosophy of science OR
experience with the real world.

>         4. Previous work in research methods or statistics OR ever having
wondered why or if something was true or false.

>         5. Previous work in statistics or mathematics or a fear of either.

>         6. An attitude and set of behaviors that reflect valuing of
scholarship and understanding.

**

Goal:**

    The goal of this course is allow participants to understand foundational principles of quantitative data analysis and to allow them to analyze data with up to moderate complexity. This includes comparisons of means across two groups, measures of independence (chi-square and correlation), and regression including multiple regression with and without dummy coding. Because the goal is to be able to do data analysis (and not just talk about it) we must do it in class, in homework, and on tests. The computer is likely to be your best friend. 
**Individual Differences:**

     Any participant in this course who has a disability that may prevent him or her from fully demonstrating his or her abilities should contact me personally as soon as possible so we can discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation and facilitate your educational process. 
**

> Philosophy:**

**

>         1. This course is about empowering** participants to take charge of
interpreting and assessing quantitative information. We live in a quantitative
world. The more you know, the less you can be manipulated by jerks who know
the language but may or may not know appropriate interpretation.

**

>         2. Participants must work like dogs** to learn this. Anyone I know
that understands anything well has worked their butt off to do it. This course
is no different.

**

>         3. Learning all the details is not enough**. Participants should ask
themselves about the bigger questions, seek clarifications, root out
contradictions -- use all the reasoning skills you would be expected to use in
any other class.

**

>         4. Only you can make it relevant to your experience.** To be
worthwhile, this must be connected to what you, or someone you know, does or
will be doing.. Ask and prod the instructor as needed.

**

>         5. This course is not about mathematics.** This course is about
rigorous thinking that uses the tools of mathematics. If you are too freaked
out by math to think straight in class, you should consider work through the
course once without a grade (auditing).

>         6. A good understanding can be had by almost all, an excellent
understanding takes a very special effort.

## 3\. Achieving Success

### How to Fail this Class:

>         1. Take a lot of other courses or obligations

>         2. Keep the content alienated from the rest of your life

>     * Don't look at the distribution of your monthly costs

>     * Don't think about variability in other people's behavior

>     * Don't critically evaluate what the instructor says

>         1. Memorize facts, avoid focusing on understanding or meaning.

>         2. Do not ask questions-you are obviously the dumbest one in class
and you don't want to let anyone know

>         3. Do not read more than you have to

>         4. Do not do more problems than what have been assigned

>         5. Do not experiment with procedures or ideas

>         6. Wait until the night before class to do the assignment

### The best idea I can think of:

    The graduate catalog states that each course should be matched with 10 hours of outside work per week. If you finish your assigned work in less than 10 hours, keep working until your time is used up.

### Requirements:

>     * Complete homework assignments

>     * Successfully complete 3 papers

>     * Successfully complete midterm and final

>     * Participation in a research project or write a 3-page paper about a
statistical topic

### Grading:

> Participation in class and completion of assignments is expected, but not
graded. Grades will be based on scores on three papers and two tests. Points
are as follows:

> Paper 1: 20 pts; Paper 2 & 3 each 40 pts

> Midterm and Final each 50 pts.

> Grades are based on the percentage of the highest grade in the class (not
the highest possible) with the following scale used to determine grades.  
>  
>  93 % or higher-----> Excellent--> A  
>  
>  80 % to 91 %--> Good------> B  
>  
>  70 % to 79 %-> Average----> C  
>  
>  60 % to 69 %-> Passing----> D  
>  
>  Below 60 %--------> Failing grade ----> E  
>  
>  A grade of "I" for incomplete is only given for "illness or other
conditions beyond the student's control" (ASU General Catalog pg 45).

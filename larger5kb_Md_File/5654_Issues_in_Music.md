### Course Description:

The **Issues in Music** course content is delivered through a series of 12
one-hour televised programs, which consist of musical performances and
commentary. Additionally, there are three two-hour class sessions, which take
place on campus with the course instructor.  
Additional contact between student and instructor is facilitated through
regular office hours (by telephone or in person). Content of the campus
sessions range from introductory materials, instruction (particularly as
concerns Aaron Copland's concepts of "What To Listen For In Music"), and
assessment.  
This course is designed to involve the student in the concert hall experience.
Performances by artist faculty consist of significant works of classical, jazz
and the music of other cultures. Analysis and discussion of these works
accompany performances. Everything is designed to involve the student in a
discussion centered around the question, "What is today's music?" This class
requires no prerequisites.

**Make-up Exam Requests:** Please mark your calendar immediately with exam
dates so that you know in advance when your exams are scheduled. Upon receipt
of the syllabus, if you see a conflict it is your responsibility to inform Dr.
Baker as well as the Telecourse office immediately of the conflict and to
submit a request for a make-up exam with supporting documentation in order for
your request to be considered. All requests must be made PRIOR to the
scheduled exam. Make-up exams are **ESSAY** in format so it is highly
recommended that you arrange to take your exam at the scheduled time indicated
in the syllabus. **You will need to provide documentation supporting the
reasons for missing exams.** Finally, Dr. Lauren Baker must be notified by the
student as to why the exam was missed and when the make-up exam is scheduled.

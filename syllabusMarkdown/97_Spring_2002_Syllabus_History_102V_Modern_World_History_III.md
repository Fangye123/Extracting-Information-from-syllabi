COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES: H 102 surveys world history from around
1750, when European industrialization transformed the power dynamics between
the West and the rest of the world, to the present. The course emphasizes
doing history by introducing students to primary sources--works produced at
the time under study--and the methods historians employ to interpret them;
this will be supplemented by lectures and text material that demonstrate how
historians shape material into historical narratives and arrive at
interpretations of the past. Students will be taught how to think historically
as well as learning the broad outlines of world history and the basic
information about the period. The course also addresses requirements for
general education by developing students' abilities in reading intelligently,
writing effectively, and processing information. (Hand-outs prepared by the
history department covering each of these skills will be handed out with this
syllabus.) These skills will be developed in part through direct encounters
with primary sources, with some lectures employed to acquaint students with
the methods with which historians deal with such sources. Lectures and text
readings will also augment students' reading and interpretive abilities.
Reading and writing skills will also be developed and assessed through both
take-home and in-class tests, as discussed below.  


COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

Because this is an on-line course, there are several technical requirements
that are necessary. These include access to a computer with Web browsing
potential (a Mac or PC more recent than 1994; a modem with a minimum speed of
28.8 Kbps; and an account with an internet service provider); and a Web
browser, Nescape 4 or newer or Internet Explorer 4 or newer. You should also
have some key skills: keyboarding and computer skills, plus experience with
Web browsing. You should all have a WebCT identification and password (well, I
guess you wouldn't be reading this if you didn't), and you should all have
gone through the on-line WebCT Student Orientation (if not, go do it;
instructions are on the "Register" page of Washburn's on-line site).

The required text for HI 102 B is Richard W. Bulliet, et al, _The Earth and
Its Peoples_ , vol. C. Students will also be required to read three primary
source selections through the course of the semester, from choices indicated
on the syllabus or choices of their own approved by the professor. These will
be available on-line whenever possible; selections not available on-line will
be on reserve at Washburn's Mabee Library, and often available at other
libraries; students will not have to purchase additional texts.

Reading assignments appear at the beginning of each lecture. Also at the
beginning of each lecture, corresponding primary sources will be mentioned.
Students do not have to read all of them. Students will select one of the
suggested primary sources for each test period (three over the course of the
semester), or they will select alternative primary sources of their own,
subject to the professor's approval. This allows students to tailor their
readings to their specific interests; the professor's selections are designed
to give students a sense of the range of possibilities in terms of thematic
focus, genre, and area of the world. Lectures will provide students with some
assistance in how to read and interpret primary sources.

The three examinations will each have two components: timed tests covering
lectures and text, and tests treating the primary sources. The text/lecture
examinations will consist of short identification questions and essay
questions; they will cover material in lectures and assigned text readings.
Study guides will be posted in the content module for the course, and can be
accessed at any time. The tests are open-book examinations, but, because they
are timed, it may be useful for students to prepare as if they did not have
their books at hand. The primary-source portion of the test will consist of a
longer (1,000 word or so) essay question concerning the primary source the
student has chosen. Questions will be designed both to ensure that the
students have actually read the primary sources they have selected and to make
them connect their reading of the primary source with other knowledge (from
text and lectures) of the period and place in which it was composed. The final
examination will not be comprehensive, covering only material covered after
the second examination. Tests can be taken whenever you are ready to do so,
but must be taken by the final date posted on the course calendar.

Both portions of the tests will be graded on a 100 point scale. On
text/lecture tests, identification will be worth 20 points (5 points per
identification), and essays will be worth 40 points each. Take-home portions
of the test will also be worth 100 points. The final grade will consist of an
average of these scores. Active class participation through the discussion
will be taken into account as a positive factor in borderline cases or, at the
discretion of the professor, to raise grades up to one level higher(for
example, from a high C to a B) when participation seems to indicate that the
student has a better grasp of material than test averages indicate. Evidence
of cheating on in-class tests or plagiarism on take-home portions of the tests
will result in automatic failure. What plagiarism consists of and how to avoid
it in writing assignments will be discussed in an on-line review session
before the first test.

Students who are having difficulties with either the reading or writing
demands of the class should avail themselves of assistance from departmental
tutors or from the English Department's Writing Center (Morgan 257). Students
having trouble with the material should also meet with the professor during
scheduled office hours (or by appointment).

Students with disabilities may identify themselves voluntarily to the Services
for Students with Disabilities Office (SSWDO) to request accommodations. The
office is responsible for assisting in arranging accommodations and for
identifying resources on campus. New requests for accommodations should be
submitted two months or more prior to the date services should begin; however,
check with the SSWDO office as soon as a need may arise. The SSWDO office is
at Morgan Hall 150; their phone number is (785)231-1010 ext. 1629. Students
may also voluntarily identify themselves to the instructor to discuss
accommodations.

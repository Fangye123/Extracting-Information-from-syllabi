 This syllabus is at <http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/608.htm>   (last
updated March 3, 1999).  I'll update it from time to time.

This colloquium will raise and discuss the following questions and some of
their implications: What does it mean to say that the United States is a
consumer society? If we are one, how and when did we become one? How widely
have consumption-oriented values and life-styles spread? Does consumption
liberate or imprison us? Although the topic is certainly contemporary, the
approach here will be historical, examining continuity and change over time.
The emphasis will be on the twentieth-century U.S.A., but we will compare
American experiences with other times and places for perspective.

**_Books:_**    I've ordered the following four books through the UO

**Requirements:**_  
   Attendance and participation is an essential part of the course. If you
cannot attend a session because of illness or some other serious reason,
please notify me in advance of the session.

_Either_ three short essays (each c. 5-8 pp.) _or_ one longer paper (c.15-20
pp.):  
   If you choose the three short essays, at least one of them must be a
commentary on one of the "cosmic" questions about consumer culture--e.g. "What
is it?", "When did it start?", "Is it good or bad?", "Is it the result of
capitalism?" The other two essays should be commentaries on a week's reading.
If you're a cosmic kind of person, you are welcome to try your hand at two
such essays and one weekly readings commentary.  
    Essay One: By Friday, Feb. 12 (end of Week Six)  
    Essay Two: By  Friday, March 5 (end of Week Nine)  
    Essay Three: By Wed., March 17 by 5 P.M

If you choose the longer paper option, we must mutually agree on a topic. If,
for example, you're interested in consumer culture and electoral politics, or
consumption and the environment, or consumer protest, we can work out a paper
topic together. This option will involve going beyond the readings assigned in
the class.

The schedule for the longer paper option is as follows:  
    Consultation and agreement on a topic: By Fri., Feb. 12 (end of Week Six)   
    Rough draft of paper to me: By Fri., March 5 (end of Week Nine)  
    Final version to me: By 5 P.M. Wed., March 17

Evaluation_:  
    Class participation: 25%  
    Written work: 75%

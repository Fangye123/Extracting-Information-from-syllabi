#### Course Requirements:

As indicated above, there will be three brief written exercises, each
analyzing a specific historical document and 3-4 pages in length, due in class
on January 29, February 19, and March 12. As the texts to be analyzed in the
exercises will be discussed at these class meetings, THE EXERCISES WILL NOT BE
ACCEPTED AFTER THE MEETING AT WHICH THEY ARE DUE.

There is also one short paper, a critical review _in light of what you have
learned from the course_ of either 1) a memoir written by a survivor, or 2) a
significant work of fiction with a Holocaust setting. This is to be
approximately 10-12 pages in length, and will be due at the last meeting
(April 23). A written statement of the subject of your paper should be given
to the instructor no later than the meeting of April 2.

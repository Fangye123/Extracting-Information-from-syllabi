###  Syllabus for Anth 422 Anthropology of Religion (Theory)

**ORIENTATION**

     What is spiritual ecology and who are its pioneers? Are indigenous people spiritual ecologists? What are the arguments for and against linking religion and ecology? What is Buddhist ecology and why have many monks turned from individual meditation to environmental activism? What are sacred places and do they have any ecological or conservation significance? These and many other questions will be explored, critically analyzed, and debated in this course. 

After introductory lectures on the anthropology of religion, the course will
successively focus on spiritual ecology, Buddhist ecology, and sacred places
through open discussion of the required texts, panel discussions of case
studies, selected videos, and guest speakers. The instructor will also discuss
with slides his related fieldwork in southern Thailand with biology colleagues
and developing comparative project in northern Venezuela and northern New
Mexico, and his participation and observations in various Harvard conferences
on spiritual ecology and one at UNESCO in Paris on sacred places and
biodiversity conservation. Researchers currently involved in the recreation of
Kahoolawe as a sacred place will discuss their work.

Each student is required to conduct and report on a modest research project
(field and/or library) on some aspect of sacred places in nature in Hawaii.

**GOALS**

     1) To provide a general survey of the anthropology of religion, 

spiritual ecology, Buddhist ecology, sacred places in nature, and related
topics.

2) To explore sacred places in Hawaii in individual research and report the
results to the class (oral presentation and written summary).

3) To become familiar with the basic literature and resources on these
subjects.

4) To critically analyze spiritual ecology and especially the pros and cons of
turning to religion as a source for the reduction or resolution of
environmental crises.

**FORMAT**

     The course will be devoted mostly to discussion, although a few lectures will be given by the instructor, especially at the beginning. There will also be some guest lectures. Discussion will include open and group discussion of the assigned readings as well as panel discussions of particular books as case studies. Videos are an integral part of the course, but most will be assigned to view outside of class while the instructor is away at conferences. A video guide is on Reserve in Sinclair Library.

**GRADING**

     The grading criteria are negotiable, but the following basis is suggested: mid-term and final take-home essay examinations (20, 25%), panel discussions (30%), research report on sacred places in Hawaii (20%), and class attendance and participation (5%). Extra credit may be earned through video reaction papers (beyond those assigned), book reports, and additional research reports.

### HISTORY 827.01  
SEMINAR IN ISLAMIC HISTORY



**Description:** This is a two-quarter research seminar in Islamic history. We
hope to bring together graduate students interested in a variety of topics in
Islamic history from the beginnings of Islam until the present. You will have
the opportunity to explore a particular subject in depth, share your findings
with your classmates, and participate in an active process of peer evaluation.
You will also have the chance to discuss historiographical and methodological
issues, to expand your reading in the scholarly literature, and to explore
original sources relevant to your topic of interest.



**Course requirements:**

  1. You must take both quarters of the seminar and submit a finished research paper at the end of spring quarter. 
  2. You must attend every class and participate in discussion. On days when book reviews are due or project proposals are presented, do your classmates the courtesy of reading their reviews and proposals. Peer interaction and peer criticism are vital elements in this seminar! 
  3. Graded assignments for winter quarter: 
    1. Each student will write a **3-4 page review** of a book by one of the guest speakers who will visit our class during spring quarter. These reviews are to be distributed to the mailboxes of your instructors and your classmates **by Tuesday, January 28**. You will read your classmates' reviews before class; in class, you will make a brief **oral presentation** of your review and comment on your classmates' presentations. 
    2. You will prepare a tentative **bibliography** for your research project and distribute it to your instructors and classmates **by Tuesday, February 4**. You will read your classmates' bibliographies before class; in class, you will make a brief **oral presentation** of your bibliography and comment on your classmates' bibliographies. 
    3. You will prepare an **outline** of your research project, along with tentative conclusions. You will distribute your outline to your instructors and classmates **by Monday, March 10**. You will prepare **written critiques** of your classmates' outlines, to be distributed in class **March 12**. On **March 12** , you will give an **oral presentation** of your proposed project and comment on your classmates' presentations.  



**Grading:** Since this is a two-quarter seminar, you will receive a grade of
P (=  "Progress") at the end of winter quarter. At the end of spring quarter,
a final grade will be calculated for both quarters. Winter quarter assignments
will be weighted as follows:

    
    
    participation in class discussions      25%
    book review and presentation            20%
    bibliography and presentation           25%
    outline, presentation, critiques        30%
    
    

Be advised, however, that you may not drop out of the seminar at the end of
winter quarter and receive a grade calculated on this basis.

###  GRADUATE DIVISION OF RELIGION                         SPRING 2001 COURSE
OFFERINGS

* * *

  
**RLAR 737K Topics in Asian Religions: Christian Missions in China
(representation, idolatry, and the body) (same as RLHT 738K)
[Reinders](http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/faculty/reinders.html)
M 9:00-12:00**  
**Max: 8**

**Content:** When a religion "spreads" or "moves" to another culture,
missionaries have to make decisions about what elements of their religion are
essential and what can be left behind. Converts have to figure out what
elements of their own culture are consistent or inconsistent with the imported
religion. These fundamental negotiations are not only matters of theological
confession, but also involve the deep structures of cultural difference,
representations of distant cultures, and the assimilation and discipline of
bodies.

With just a few exceptions, no other group of people went to China in such
large numbers, lived among the Chinese, spoke the language, argued in the
streets, and wrote so much about their experiences. Missionaries introduced
"the West" to China, and introduced "China" to the West. Whatever your opinion
of their motivation, they went to save souls--not to buy and sell like
traders, not to posture with the ruling elite like diplomats, not to point a
gun like soldiers, and not to leave after a month like tourists. The study of
missions thus gives us a uniquely well-articulated view into the real
processes of inter-religious negotiation and the nature of cultural
difference.

This course will explore aspects of missions, through a case study of
Christian missions in China. Comparative perspective will come from shorter
case studies of Christian missions in Japan, Korea, and India, and of Buddhist
missions in China and America. The larger theoretical issues include:  
\--"nativization," "indigenization," or "accommodation" from foreign and
native perspectives,  
\--issues of interpretation and representation associated with missions, and
the critical role of the body,  
\--translation debates--how to translate "God" in Chinese--and views of the
Chinese language,  
\--the dynamics of interactions between distant cultures, on the ground and in
more general terms,  
\--the construction of other religions as "idolatry"  
\--transplanting into China the categories and memory of Western religious
history, e.g. the Reformation, the Golden Calf, Paul's missions.  
\--a comparative, historical theory of missions?

**Texts:** May include: Jonathon Spence, _The Memory Palace of Matteo Ricci_ ;
Matteo Ricci, _The True Meaning of the Lord of Heaven_ (Tianzhu shiyi); Daniel
H. Bays, ed., _Christianity in China From the Eighteenth Century to the
Present;_ Paul A. Cohen, _China and Christianity: The Missionary Movement and
the Growth of Chinese Antiforeignism, 1860-1870;_ one of a selection of
missionary biographies; selections from missionary journals and publications,
including archival work.

**Particulars:** Consistent with my emphasis on writing as an ongoing process,
throughout the semester students will write reactions, comments, and reviews,
and read each others' work. Your research paper should be on Christian
missions in China, but it could be a comparative paper involving another case
study (e.g missions to India, etc.) There will also be a brief exam on
terminology early in the semester.

**RLE 733 Love & Justice
[Jackson](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Jackson.html)         W 2:30 - 5:30**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** Few concepts are more central to ethics than love and justice,
but none is more subject to varying interpretation than these two. The course
seeks to clarify several philosophical and theological accounts of love and
justice, with particular emphasis on how they interrelate. Is love ideally
indiscriminate and/or sacrificial and therefore antithetical to justice? Is
justice a single virtue equally binding on all human beings? Does God possess
either virtue? How are we to conceive (and act on) such related values as
rationality, creativity, human rights, and civil liberties? These will be some
of the central concerns of our common reflection. Readings are selected from a
broad range of perspectives, spanning historical, racial, and gender
diversity. Readings include works by Plato, Augustine, Aquinas, Niebhur,
Rawls, West, Shklar, and Nussbaum. This course is designed for graduate
students and presupposes some knowledge of ethical theory; it is, however,
open to advanced undergraduates and Candler students.

**Particulars:** Substantial readings per week, class participation, and two
12-15 page papers.

* * *

  
**RLE 735 Feminist Ethics
[Bounds](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Bounds.html)         Th 6:30-9:30**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** This course provides an advanced introduction to contemporary
feminist religious and philosophical ethics. There will be 4 problem areas
shaping the course: 1)what have been the key questions motivating feminist
ethicists (a genealogy of feminist ethics)?; 2)how has feminist ethics engaged
the intersecting forces of class, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexuality?;
3)what is the significance of the current debates within feminist theory over
the relative merits of postmodernism and critical theory?; 4)what is the
relationship of feminist religious and philosophical ethics?

**Texts:** Readings will include works by Benhabib, Butler, Fraser, Haraway,
Harrison, Levitt, Townes, Young.

**Particulars:** Each student will participate once as 1)discussion leader
(with preparation of a short 3-page position paper to be distributed the week
before); 2)respondent (with preparation of a 1-page position paper to be
distributed before class; and 3)class recorder. A proposal, outline, and final
research paper is also required.

**RLHB 720H - Exegetical Seminar on Song of Songs
[Buss](http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/faculty/buss.html)         M
1:00-4:00**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** The seminar will be devoted to the Song of Songs, with limited
attention to procedural issues, including linguistic ones.

**Particulars:** One half of the seminar will be devoted to two topics: (1)
the relation of the Song to the Book of Hosea and (2) the relation of the Song
to love songs elsewhere, including some of India that are especially close in
content and (apparently) in social role and some that are different. Students
who wish to write their annual paper as part of this seminar will omit this
half of the seminar; of course, they can listen to reports emanating from it.

**RLHB 750 Israelite History
[Hayes](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Hayes.html)                     Tu
1:00-4:00**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** This seminar will meet weekly and focus on selected issues
pertaining to the history of ancient Israel. It presupposes a general
knowledge of ancient history and especially of Middle Eastern history during
biblical times.

**Particulars:** There will be weekly assignments for all participants in the
seminar, rather than a single research paper or final examination.

**RLHB 792 - Issues in Hebrew Bible Studies
[Newsom](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Newsom.html)             Th 1:00-4:00**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** This seminar, offered every other year, takes up a rotating
series of classic and current issues in the study of the Hebrew Bible. For
Spring, 2001, the issues will be focused on issues of textuality and
interpretation. Possible units include hermeneutics of biblical texts, the
textualization of ritual, comparison of texts across cultural boundaries, the
problem of divergent text histories, and issues in the recovery of antecedent
texts from composite works. Faculty from across the department will
participate in various of the units.

**Texts:** Readings will include both particular studies from the discipline
of Hebrew Bible and theoretical materials of an interdisciplinary nature.

**Particulars** : Students will present a series of reading reports and case
studies but no major paper.

**RLHT 721R Seminar in Aquinas (same as HIST 586K)
[Reynolds](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Reynolds.html)             W
9:00-12:00**  
**Max: 8**

**Content** : This seminar will focus on Thomas Aquinas's concept of the
nature, methods and purpose of theology. Topics include theology as a science,
theological epistemology, the limits of reason, and theological language (the
"divine names"). The seminar will also consider the cultural and institutional
background of Thomas's work.

**Texts** : The central texts of the seminar are from Thomas's Summa
theologiae. Texts for philosophical, cultural and historical background
include: M.D. Chenu, Toward Understanding St Thomas; J.P. Torrell, Saint
Thomas and his Work; E. Gilson, History of Christian Philosophy in the Middle
Ages; and J.W. Baldwin, The Scholastic Culture of the Middle Ages. Students
may follow the primary sources in English translation or in the original
Latin. (If they have Latin, they should use it, but they don't need to know
Latin to take the course.)

**Particulars:** The central method is the course is close reading and
discussion of rather small sections of Thomas's Summa. In addition, each
student chooses a topic in Thomas or an historically related field (such as
the University of Paris), prepares a bibliography of secondary literature on
this topic over the last 15 years, summarizes one article and one book from
this list, and presents these summaries to the rest of the group. Assessment
will be based partly (20%) on these summaries but mainly (80%) on a final
paper based on primary sources.

**RLHT 735K- Topics in American Religious History: Cultures of Death
[Laderman](http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/faculty/laderman.html)
Th 10:00-1:00**  
**(Same as HIST586L and ILA 790X)**  
**Max: 6**

**Content:** This seminar will explore religious history by focusing on death,
and particularly the various cultures of death that have emerged on the
American social landscape. We will cover both familiar cultural forms of
expression, such as the Puritan way of death and the popularity of
spiritualism, as well as more unusual forms, such as the material culture of
cemeteries and the hip hop genre identified as "requiem rap."

**Texts:** Ann Braude, "Radical Spirits: Spiritualism and Women's Rights in
Nineteenth-Century America"; Kristin Ann Hass, "Carried to the Wall: American
Memory and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial"; Janice Hume, "Obituaries in
American Culture"; Gary Laderman, "The Sacred Remains: American Attitudes
Toward Death, 1799-1899"; Thomas Lynch, "The Undertaking: Life Studies From
the Dismal Trade"; Greil Marcus, "Dead Elvis: A Chronicle of a Cultural
Obsession"; Jessica Mitford, "The American Way of Death Revisited"; David
Stannard, "The Puritan Way of Death"

**Particulars:** Students will be expected to do the reading, lead seminar
sessions, and present on research in progress, which will include bringing in
primary material for analysis and discussion.

**RLHT 735L Topics in American Religious History: Muslim Identities in America
[Martin](http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/faculty/martin.html)         Th
2:30 - 5:30**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** The offering of this seminar reflects the interest of the
academy, and increasingly of Emory, in issues of identity and diversity among
American Muslims, a situation that has been described as "a pluralism within a
pluralism" by one American Muslim leader. In keeping with Emory's current
academic year theme of "Year of Reconciliation," this first offering of the
seminar will focus on the growing diversity of the American Muslim
communities, the impact of the globalization of Islam and the American social
milieu on Islam in America, and the role of both traditional (e.g., pilgrimage
to Mecca) and modern (internet and media) possibilities for establishing a
common identity among Muslims, with a special focus on Atlanta and the
Southwest. The seminar will begin with a discussion of the philosophical
issues raised by Columbia University philosopher Akeel Bilgrami in his 1992
article in _Critical Inquiry_ , "What is a Muslim? Fundamental Commitment and
Cultural Identity." We will then read and discuss an interdisciplinary variety
of recent works on the social, economic, legal, cultural and religious history
and development of African American and immigrant Muslim communities and their
interruptions with each other within the North American ethos. Some of the
authors and public figures we read will be invited to meet with the seminar,
in person or possibly in televideo conference.

**Texts:** During the course of the semester, students will collaborate to
build a comprehensive bibliography of library, internet and other materials
that would belong in a contemporary archive. Select works about Islam in
America will be read, analyzed and, and critiqued in seminar. Special effort
will be made to discover writings in the fields of law, economics, the social
sciences, gender studies and other fields that increasingly pertain to issues
of Muslim identity in America, in addition to the now standard works by such
scholars as Yvonne Haddad and Richard Turner on Islam in American religious
history.

**Particulars:** The seminar will meet and discuss select texts for the first
six weeks or so. In the second stage of the semester, students will meet
individually with the instructor (occasionally in special gatherings with
guest speakers) as they prepare and write their research projects. This second
phase will also be a time for field work in the Atlanta area. After the first
of April, the seminar will resume meeting to hear presentations of student
research papers. Thus, aggressive and well-prepared class participation as
well as the final paper will constitute the main obligation of students in
fulfilling the requirements of the seminar.

1:00-4:00**  
**MAX: 12**

**Content:** The focus of the seminar is exegetical: it provides an
opportunity for close reading of the Greek text of Acts, giving attention to
text-critical questions, especially the distinctive readings of the Western
text, but also to historical and literary dimensions of the text. Attention is
also given to the history of scholarship on Acts.

[Brown](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Brown.html)         Tu 10:00-1:00**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** This seminar will serve as an intensive introduction to the
literature and material culture of the Greco-Roman period. To that end, the
course will focus on primary sources as a means of evaluating and
understanding the various components of ancient culture. Secondary sources
will be utilized to expand upon primary readings and to provide resources for
further study.

historical reconstruction and evaluation drawing largely upon the readings.
Students will be evaluated on class participation (including one presentation)
and one major paper. Students will be encouraged to explore and employ one
strategy of historical reconstruction of their choice--developing a proposal,
conducting research, and analyzing and interpreting the research.

**RLPC 710G After Violence: Futuring the End of Victimization
[Smith](http://www.emory.edu/COLLEGE/RELIGION/faculty/smith.html)
Tu 1:00-4:00**  
**(same as ILA 790U)**  
**Max: 8**

**Content:** "Willing the well-being of victim and violator in the context of
the fullest possible knowledge of the nature of the violation . . . holds the
possibility of breaking the chain of violence." In such terms Marjorie
Suchocki formulates her prescription for 'curing violence' in her book on
"relational" theology, _The Fall to Violence_. Other course texts emphasize
the causes of violence instead of (or alongside of) its cures. Focal for the
course are systemic, structural, and institutional forms of victimization and
violence that persist in human affairs from the mundane to the cataclysmic. A
central consideration will be the theory of chronic scapegoating, mimetic
desire, and sacred violence developed by Rene Girard (Stanford _emeritus_ )
and currently under research and critique by members of the Colloquium on
Violence and Religion (COV&R; see website).

A key framework for the course is the idea of "futuring": assume that a
visionary goal--here, for example, managing systemic violence--has been
achieved at some point in the future however hopeless its actual achievement
may seem under current conditions. Then speculate: How was that achievement
possible? From the vantage point of projected future achievements,
hypothesize: What theories and practices await development from within the
current state of affairs to enable a shift toward that goal? Summary
considerations in the course will include: What are next steps along a
trajectory toward that ventured future, "after violence"?

Goldman                         Th 10:00 -1:00**  
**Max:12**

**Content:** This course will focus on religion and nationalism in the reading
of sacred texts in two different cultures. Both of these cultures gained
independence at around the same time (1947 and 1948 respectively), and both
are struggling with the nature of secular and religious identity. Both have
been the focus of religiously motivated violence in the last decade, and have
seen the ascendancy of conservative religious groups (Hindu and Jewish) into
mainstream politics. Both construct their identity over and against the Muslim
outsider. Our question for the graduate seminar will be: How are religious
texts read in these highly charged religious and political contexts? What
lessons can be learned from Israel about India, and from India about Israel?
How do these contexts affect the formation of religious identity, and the
practices of religious reading in each culture?

**Texts:** Primary Sources: _The Tanakh, The Talmud, The Rg Veda, The
Upanisads, The Ramayana_

Secondary Sources may include:  
A. Rivitzky, _Messianism, Zionism, and Jewish Religious Radicalism_

**RLSR 775 Contemporary American Religion
[Eiesland](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Eiesland.html)
Tu 9:00 -12:00**  
**(Same as SOC 790C)**  
**Max: 9**

**Content:** This graduate seminar introduces students to current quantitative
and qualitative research on the demographics, organizational forms, and
diversity of religion in the United States. The course will use three
contemporary theoretical axes in the sociology of religion, i.e., debates
surrounding secularization theories, social movement theories, and
organizational theories, for developing frameworks for interpreting data on
religion.

**Texts:** Robert Wuthnow, _The Restructuring of American Religion_ ; Jay
Demerath, Peter Dobkin Hall, Terry Schmitt, and Rhys Williams, eds. _Sacred
Companies_ ; R. Stephen Warner and Judith Wittner, _Gatherings in Diaspora_ ;
Phillip Hammond, _Religion and Personal Autonomy_ ; extensive reading packet.

**Particulars:** Full seminar preparation and participation. Students will
present seminar discussion papers at least once during the course. Students
will make a second presentation either on 1) original research in contemporary
American religion, e.g., ethnographic field study, or 2) an overview and
evaluation of current research in an area of interest in contemporary American
religion, e.g., new age religiosity, Messianic Jews, African-American Islam.
Students will be expected to develop the second presentation into a major term
paper (20-25 pages).

**RLTS 753H Emotions and Passions
[Saliers](http://www.emory.edu/CANDLER/Saliers.html)
Tu 5:00-8:00**  
**Max: 12** ****

**Content:** Beginning with key figures, philosophical and theological, who
define certain "classical" approaches to human subjectivity, this seminar
explores the centrality of emotions, passions and feelings in religious
practice and experience.  We will examine the claim: "the language of
religious faith is the language of the human heart."  Drawing on resources and
methods of interpretation from both analytic and phenomenological traditions,
especially from recent work in philosophical psychology,  the seminar traces
complex relationships between belief, knowledge, religious practices and human
subjectivity in a select range of texts.

**Texts:   **Special attention will be given to Augustine's Confessions,
Jonathan Edwards' Treatise on Religious Affections, Kierkegaard's Edifying
Discourses, Scheleirmacher's Speeches, and selected religious poets (Donne,
Herbert, Eliot,  Denise Levertov, and others). Other resources from Plato,
Aristotle, Aquinas, Spinoza, Hume, Wittegenstein, Amelie Rorty and recent
articles.

F 9:00-12:00**  
**Max: 12**

**Content:** This seminar will explore some of the classical paradigms for
interpreting the human condition. We will focus our attention on the variety
of ways Christian thinkers have described bondage and freedom including, e.g.

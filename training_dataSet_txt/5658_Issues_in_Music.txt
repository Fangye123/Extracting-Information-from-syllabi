Please be aware that this syllabus
is subject to change. Please be sure to check the hotline at 974-3063 or
this website regularly for changes as they will be posted here as soon
as we become aware of them.







Course Description:The
Issues in Music course content is delivered through a series of 12 one
hour televised programs, which consist of musical performances and commentary.
Additionally, there are three two-hour class sessions, which take place
on campus with the course instructor.
Additional contact between student and
instructor is facilitated through regular office hours (by telephone or
in person). Content of the campus sessions range from introductory materials,
instruction (particularly as concerns Aaron Copland's concepts of "What
To Listen For In Music"), and to assessment.
This course is designed to involve the
student in the concert hall experience. Performances by artist faculty
consist of significant works of classical, jazz and the music of other
cultures. Analysis and discussion of these works accompany performances.
Everything is designed to involve the student in a discussion centered
around the question, "What is today's music?" No prerequisites.

Important: Please
do not write your notes on the materials from Pro-Copy, 5209 Fowler Avenue.
Tampa Ph: 988-5900. You need to retain the Pro-Copy materials in order
to study for your exams.  Instead, write your notes on plain paper
and make a photocopy of your notes before you turn them in.
Obtaining your Grade: 
Sorry, absolutely no grades are given over the phone or email. 
Grades are posted in the Distance Learning Student Support office, SVC
1072, usually 1-2 weeks after the exams are taken.  If you wish to
have your grade mailed to you, please provide the Student Support office
with a self-addressed stamped envelope, and your grade will be mailed to
you as soon as it is posted.  Our address is:  Educational Outreach,
Distance Learning Student Support, SVC 1072, U.S.F., 4202 E. Fowler Ave.,
Tampa, FL 33620.
Make up exam requests: 
Please mark your calendar immediately with exam dates so that you know
in advance when your exams are scheduled.  Upon receipt of the syllabus,
if you see a conflict it is your responsibility to inform Dr. Baker as
well as the Student Support office immediately of the conflict and to submit
a request for a make-up exam with supporting documentation in order for
your request to be considered.  All requests must be made PRIOR to
the scheduled exam. Make-up exams are essay in format so it is highly recommended
that you arrange to take your exam at the scheduled time indicated in the
syllabus. You will need to provide documentation supporting the reasons
for missing exams. Finally, Dr. Lauren Baker must be notified by the student
as to why the exam was missed and when the makeup exam is scheduled.

meetings, and failure to attend class or to view the video of the meetings
may affect your grade. It is very important for your success that
you attend or view these class meetings.
 
      Attention Students:   Issues in Music is shown on WUSF-TV
  twice per week and it is recommended that you view the programs on a weekly
  basis.  Students should NOT rely on the overnight block feed as their
  sole source of viewing the programs.  Please read the information at the
  end of the syllabus regarding the overnight blockfeed.  It's purpose is
  to provide you with an additional opportunity to obtain any videos you may
  have missed during the regular weekly broadcasts.  Also, as of today
  1/19/01, minor changes have been made to the blockfeed schedule so it is
  important that you refer back to this syllabus on the web on a regular basis
  to look for updated information.

                                                            schedule was revised

                                                            Please follow this
                                                            schedule and
                                                            disregard any
                                                            previous schedules
                                                            that were posted or
                                                            printed.
On Tuesday,
1/30 please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #1-5 as the blockfeed
will begin  at 12:00am on Wednesday, 1/31 . The programming
will continue until 5:00am. 
On
                                                            Tuesday, 3/20
please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #6-10 as the blockfeed will
begin  at 12:00am on Wednesday, 3/21.  The programming
will continue until 5:00am.
On Tuesday,
4/03 please prepare your VHS tape to record Videos #11-12 as the block

Attention Students:
We recommend that you tape the
programs as they are being broadcast on WUSF-TV channel 16 on a weekly
basis.
We do NOT recommend that you rely on
the block feed/overnight broadcast as your only means of seeing the videos 
because:
A)  Your VCR could malfunction
B)  Your power could go off
C)   You could forget to set
your VCR
D)  WUSF-TV could have broadcasting
difficulties
Also, it is not a valid excuse
to request special consideration from the instructor (ie: makeup exam,
) if there is a technical problem with the overnight broadcast. Therefore,
tape the programs off the air during the weekly broadcasts, and then if
you missed any of the programs, the overnight broadcast/block feed will
enable you to view the programs you missed.






For the 3 Credit Hour Course
(Sections 502 Only!):
If
you are taking this course for 3 hours, in addition to the course requirements
listed above, you will be required to write an annotated bibliography.
Further discussion and explanation will follow at the first review session.
Annotated
Bibliography

annotated bibliography in which each source has been examined and the author
provides commentary on the source. The commentary usually comes in paragraph
or outline form directly under the citation. (See examples)

an annotated bibliography of 20 sources and annotate them. The list of
sources must include:

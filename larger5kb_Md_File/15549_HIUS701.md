### Course Description

The aim of this course is to introduce graduate students to some of the major
books dealing with U.S. history from the first contact between Europeans and
American Indians through Reconstruction. Our goal is to acquaint students with
a wide variety of approaches and interpretations in many of the sub-fields of
American history.

We will be meeting twice a week. For each session we will be focusing on one
or two major works of interpretation. We hope to generate wide-ranging
discussions that, in part, will be based on questions and comments that
students themselves generate through e-mail exchanges prior to the scheduled
meeting.

The class is mainly a reading and discussion seminar, but there will be three
or four short papers as well. Students will be allowed to choose topics and
evaluate the key book in terms of two or three other books or articles dealing
with the same subject. The papers will be short, about five pages. On the days
they are due we will not be assigning other reading.

### Course Requirements

**You must submit three questions _prior to each class session_ , based on the
assigned readings. The questions should demonstrate your mastery of the
readings and point to issues and themes that you think merit our particular
attention. The questions should be sent to your colleagues by e-mail by 9 a.m.
on class day; they should be submitted Profs. Ayers and Onuf _in hard copy_ (a
set to each) by the same time.

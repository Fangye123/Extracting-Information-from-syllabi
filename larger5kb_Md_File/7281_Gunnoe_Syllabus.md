>  **Goal Statement:** The course aims to build skills in critical thinking,
writing and historical analysis through a survey of modern Russian history. We

intelligentsia by reading a classic Russian novel

such groups as anarchists and socialists

and the continuing historical controversy surrounding it

administrations on everyday life by reading the memoirs of Russian women

experiment failed

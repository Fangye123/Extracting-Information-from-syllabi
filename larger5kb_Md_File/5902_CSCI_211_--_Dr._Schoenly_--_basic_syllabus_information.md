**2001 UM Undergraduate Catalog Data:**  
CSCI 211. COMPUTER SCIENCE III. Devices and techniques for conventional file
processing, sequential, hashed, indexed organizations; language and operating
support facilities. Prerequisite: CSCI 112. (3).  
  

* * *

  
  
**Prerequisites:**  
See above. CSCI 111 and CSCI 112 or their equivalents must be completed before
undertaking CSCI 211. Evidence of your completion of these courses or their
equivalents may be requested.

**Textbook:**  
Harvey Deitel  & Paul Deitel: _Java: How to Program_ ; **Fourth edition**  
Prentice-Hall, 2002; ISBN 0-13-034151-7  
**NOTE: please get the new 4th edition!**  
  
Review of your CSCI 111 and CSCI 112 textbooks may be helpful as you recall
what you learned from those courses.  
  
Also, Sun's Online Java Tutorial may be very helpful, especially if you do not
have a copy of either the CSCI 111 or CSCI 112 Java textbook. [Click here to
go to Sun's online Java tutorial.](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/)  
  
Have you downloaded and installed the free JDK software on your own PC? Have
you also downloaded and installed the free JDK html Java API documentation? If
not, you should do so immediately in order to get ready for the programming
exercises for this course.  
  
Visit the Deitel author's web site to download sample programs, etc.
Information concerning the course will also be available for downloading
locally: see the [download link](ftp://sbs.cs.olemiss.edu/) at the bottom of
these web pages.  
  
The bookstore on the University of Mississippi campus, and other bookstores in
Oxford, should have copies of the textbook available for you to purchase.  
  
You might also want to consider online shopping for your textbooks. Dr.
Cunningham (another CS faculty member at UM) has prepared a [ list of online
bookstore web
sites.](http://www.cs.olemiss.edu/~hcc/resources/bookstores.html)

**Course goals:**  
The purpose of this course is to give students opportunities for advanced
programming experience, focusing on the traditional topics related to file
processing. Other important topics such as network programming, Java GUI
design, multithreading, exception handling, etc. will be covered.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Applicability of CSCI 211 to degree:  
**  
CSCI 211 is the third required course in the B.S. and B.A. computer science
programs. It is also part of any minor in CS. Some other departments also
require or suggest CSCI 211 for their majors. Consult with your advisor if you
have any questions about the role of CSCI 211 in your program of study.

**[Sitting in on the class:](../sitting.html)**  
If you would like to "sit in on the class" without being enrolled in any way,
[click here](../sitting.html) to review my guidelines concerning this
practice.  
  

* * *

  
  
**[Lab facilities and Java software:](../software.html)**  
CSCI 211 still uses the "open lab" concept, in which you are responsible for
doing your programming exercises and homework by yourself, with the Honor Code
in effect, at your own pace, on your own schedule, using (if you wish) your
own computing resources.  
  
Students can complete programming exercises using lab facilities located in
the CS department in Kinard Hall. [Click here to go to the online account
application page,](http://www.cherry.cs.olemiss.edu/account/request.jsp) where
you can fill out an online form to obtain your personal logon account for the
Kinard Hall CS labs.  
  
Students who have access to their own PCs can use them for completion of
exercises.  
  
All of the software needed for completion of the programming exercises can be
obtained at little or no cost. See the separate page concerning [Java
software](../software.html) for additional information.

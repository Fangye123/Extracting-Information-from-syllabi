**Course content:** Archipelagoes have been called "crucibles of evolution".
This is especially true of the Hawaiian Islands, which combine incredible
biological diversity with spectacular natural beauty. This course is an
exploration of the biota, geology, and geography of these remote oceanic
islands, which are home to numerous endemic species of birds, plants, and
invertebrates, many of which are unknown to science. We will visit the full
range of habitats provided by the islands, from coral reefs to volcano peaks,
from lush tropical forests to hot deserts. Our goal is to observe first-hand
the biological diversity and complex ecology of this Pacific paradise. Each
student will keep a field notebook (described below) where observations and
interpretations will be recorded.

**Sources of information:** The primary source of information will be your own
observations of the natural history of the islands. We will be primarily
concerned with observations and interpretations of the ways the plants and
animals make their living, and how they came to be what and where they are. We
have two required "textbooks". One is the Smithsonian Guide to Natural America
-- The Pacific; this book contains a wealth of information about the islands,
and includes much natural history and cultural history, as well as lots of
practical information. The other is Hawaii's Birds, published by the Hawaii
Audubon Society. This is a thin but beautifully illustrated guide to the
extant (and in some cases extinct) avifauna of the islands, much of which is
threatened or endangered. There are two other field guides that might be
useful but are not required. They are An Underwater Guide to Hawai'i by
Fielding and Robinson (marine invertebrates, fish, and other vertebrates) and
Trees of Hawai'i by Kepler. These can be ordered through the campus bookstore
or purchased once we reach the islands. There is also a requirement of reading
one book from a selection of environmental or biological books (not textbooks)
such as Darwin's Voyage of the Beagle or On the Origin of Species, Leopold's
Sand County Almanac, Wilson's Diversity of Life or Naturalist, Weiner's The
Beak of the Finch, Tinbergen's Curious Naturalists, Who Gave Pinta to the
Santa Maria by R.S. Desowitz, or Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the
World by M. Kurlansky. Any other book of this sort that interests you would be
acceptable.

What does the term "natural history" mean? Most biologists who study whole
organisms would agree on a few common themes, but each would probably
emphasize some things over others. I am most interested in how organisms are
adapted through the action of natural selection (including sexual selection
and indirect selection) to fit their abiotic, biotic, and social environments.
There are a variety of manifestations of adaptation. Morphology (how a body is
structured on the outside), anatomy (how a body is structured on the inside),
physiology (the chemical workings of a body), life history strategy
(allocation of resources to and timing of somatic growth and reproduction
during ontogeny), and behavior (how an organism responds in the short term to
stimuli in its environment) are all characteristics of organisms that can be
interpreted from the perspective of evolution and adaptation. The
"environment" can be any physical, chemical, or biological factor (including
conspecifics) that influences or impinges on an organism. This takes in a lot
of territory. In general, physical and chemical factors constitute the abiotic
environment, heterospecific organisms (viruses, bacteria, plants, insects,
vertebrates, etc.) form the biotic environment, and conspecific organisms form
the social environment. Ecologists think of the environment in terms of the
"ecological niche" of a species; the niche comprises an indeterminate number
of niche "axes" or "dimensions", which are essentially environmental variables
(including other organisms) that affect the survival and reproduction of
individual organisms. I say "indeterminate" because one can always think up
new variables that might affect organisms. Organisms are conglomerates of
characteristics that function together as a unit, and the unit is designed (by
the action of natural selection) to function efficiently within the
environment. The conglomeration of design features or adaptations is termed
the "adaptive syndrome". So, in a few words, natural history is the study of
the adaptive syndrome of organisms, and how organisms fit their ecological
niches.

**Field notebooks:** You will record activities, observations, and impressions
in a field notebook. The format of the field notebook varies greatly among
field biologists, and takes on different forms in different specializations
within field biology. Traditionally, the field notebook consists of three
sections: the log, the species accounts, and the journal. Most field
biologists keep notes in a loose-leaf notebook (5.5" x 7.5" or 6" x 9") with
the three sections separated. The traditional writing materials were a stylus
pen with india ink on cotton bond paper. I recommend ball-point pen for
written records of observations, and a #2 pencil with blank or bond paper for
drawings.

In this course, loose-leaf binders are mandatory -- they allow you to
rearrange your species accounts to keep them in proper taxonomic order, and to
add new ones as you make more observations. It is useful to have pockets in
your notebook to keep things like maps or directions to field sites, pens and
pencils, rulers, conversion tables, receipts, etc. Notebook binders, dividers,
and paper are available in the campus bookstore and in other places around
town.  


  * The log is where you record all of the practical information about your field trip: where you went and how you got there (which will be particularly cool in our case), when you were there, and what the weather was like (temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, cloud cover, etc.). Each page of the log should be dated (and numbered if you wish). The log should also contain information about the characteristics of the particular locality you visited, which will vary depending on what kind of a place it was. For terrestrial habitats, important information about locality includes topography (mountain, canyon, caldera, stream, talus slope, lava flow, etc.), elevation, vegetation [general description of the plant assemblage (e.g. "cloud forest", "silversword desert") as well as information about dominant species (e.g. "ohia lehua and tree ferns")], and substrate type (nature of the soil and rocks -- we will learn about this as we go). For shallow marine habitats, the important information includes "topography" (fringing coral reef, patch reef, spur and groove reef, atoll, dissected slope, etc.), depth, distance from shore, and substrate (stony coral, rock, sand, marine plant life).

  * The species accounts include all observations and information on particular types of organisms. The tradition in field biology, especially in vertebrate field biology, is to make an entry in the field notebook each time you observe an individual of a particular species. Over time, with successive observations, a picture of the "autecology" and the "synecology" of each species develops in your notebook. Our species accounts of vertebrates will be of the traditional type, and we will include any new information obtained from successive observations. Others will not be traditional "species" accounts because we will not identify some organisms to species. At the level of sophistication of this course, it will be adequate to use, for instance, "soft coral type #1" to identify a certain type of organism, as long as we all know what we are talking about, and can distinguish "soft coral type #1" from "soft coral type #2". To achieve this, your accounts should have descriptions and drawings of the animals and plants you encounter (and of their distinguishing characteristics), so that you can recognize them again and make more complete accounts. In some cases this will require careful observation and memory, followed by reference to field guides, followed by additional observation.

> In addition to morphological descriptions, your accounts should include
information about microhabitat (where specifically within the larger habitat
was this organism found?), population or social group size, interspecific and
intraspecific interactions (both competitive and cooperative), and behaviors
such as foraging and predator avoidance. The species accounts should make
reference to the log so that you know where and when you found a certain
creature. Some of our accounts will be "community accounts" rather than
species accounts, because we will be interested in the composition and
structure of plant and animal communities of particular habitats. These
accounts will contain descriptions of the general type of plant or animal
community, and will include information about species diversity and the
dominant species of the community.

  * The journal is a place to record your interpretations of the events of the day, or your thoughts and feelings on life in general. It is a place for the development of scientific knowledge and ideas (i.e., "Today I saw... This might be important because..."). It is common to have some intuition about what is happening in a particular situation, but for the intuition to be vague or incomplete. My personal preference for journal entries is to consider the organisms and communities that I encounter from an evolutionary perspective (as Dobzhansky put it, "in biology nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution"). Your journal should include a developing discussion of a) the adaptive syndrome of particular species that we encounter, b) the ecological relationships between species that we observe, and c) the composition and structure of ecological communities that we observe. The journal develops over time with the species accounts and the log, as the latter two sections include more and more information about localities and organisms. The field notebooks of some field biologists develop into important scientific works, such as Henry Fitch's Reproductive Cycles in Lizards and Snakes.

  

* * *

**Grades:** Grading in this course is S/U. My grading of your notebooks will
be based on my observation of how thoroughly you record observations. I expect
everyone to record observations thoroughly, legibly, and accurately. We will
record many observations as a group, so that you learn to be observant. We
will discuss and share our interpretations and impressions, but your journal
should reflect your own ideas and biases. Your field notebook is your own
record of the trip. It will be a permanent record of what you saw and what you
did -- it will only be as good as you make it. Unfortunately, this may be the
only time you see the islands in this condition; rapid habitat transformation
places many species in great peril of extinction, and entire ecosystems are
endangered as well. I will collect field notebooks before we land at DFW on
our return trip, and will return them at the beginning of the Spring semester.
I will not make any marks in your notebook, and anything that you write will
be held in strict confidence.

* * *

**Important considerations:**

  * A few necessary (but hopefully unnecessary) words about personal conduct: We are all in this together. Each member of our crew must conduct himself or herself in a manner that will make this a positive experience for all involved. When we are in the field, everyone needs to be attentive and observant, and to stay on task. This can be difficult when we are tired, sore, and crabby. I expect mature, cordial, and professional interaction, for everyone to pull his or her weight, and for you to work diligently on your readings and notebooks. Everyone must be ready to leave at our scheduled departure times. I have leisure time built into the itinerary, and from past experience, you will need it.

  * Because of legal liabilities, there can be no underage drinking (and any drinking by those 21 and over must be in moderation). There must be no solo swimming. Any possession or use of controlled substances will be grounds for immediate dismissal from the course. I will put you on a plane home at your own expense.

  * Because the Hawaiian Islands are volcanic and climatically diverse, the terrain is rugged. Many places that are biologically interesting are not accessible by motorized vehicle. Therefore, we must walk, and some of our walks will be both long and steep. We should all be physically prepared for this type of activity. My own preference for preparation is walking, but not just around the campus or the mall. When I have time, I walk on "Hospital Hill", the area around WNJ hospital. I also carry a backpack containing some heavy objects, because I will be carrying the same thing on our walks. It is a good idea to wear your hiking boots during your preparations, especially if they are relatively new. I also recommend carrying the backpack you will carry in the field, so that you are used to the feel and the weight.

  * Because of the extremely fragile nature of many of the habitats we will visit, it imperative that you practice good environmental etiquette. Always stay on hiking trails; venturing off established and maintained trails damages plants and the soil surface, which accelerates erosion. Never cut across switchbacks. Avoid trampling or damaging plants as much as possible; do not pick any flowers, because they may be the last ones for that plant species. We will observe rather than collect insects. When birding, it is necessary to be as quiet and unobtrusive as possible. When snorkeling, be careful not to step on or bump into corals -- this is for your protection as much as theirs. Do not disturb green sea turtles; they are a protected species. Finally, do not attempt to feed native wildlife, especially the Hawaiian state bird, the Nene -- this is illegal and carries a substantial fine.

  * Sometime before the end of the fall term (probably late October or early November), there will be a warm-up snorkel, so it is necessary to get your gear by that time (unless it is going to be a Christmas present). This will be held in the Hannah Natatorium, probably on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. I will let you know once I schedule this with Coach Lawson. The goal for this activity is to get used to the feel of the gear, to make sure it works properly, and for those who have not snorkeled before, to learn how to float, breathe, dive, equalize your pressure, and come up without inhaling a bunch of water. It is not as hard as it sounds.

  * There will also be a warm-up hike of five miles or so, sometime in November or early December, probably at the Cross Timbers trail along the south side of Lake Texoma. We will plan this for a mutually agreeable Saturday or Sunday. This will be an opportunity for us to test our gear and our conditioning, and to get an idea of what we need to carry on this type of short day-hike. The College will provide transportation, ARA will provide lunch (if necessary), and I will provide goodies.

  * We will be flying on American Airlines to and from Honolulu, and on Hawaii Airlines between islands. All airport security is controlled by the FAA. These people are very serious about security. Be sure to carefully control your luggage at all times. Never leave your luggage unattended, because it may be confiscated by security personnel. DO NOT make any jokes about weapons, bombs, hazardous substances, or hijackng, either when passing through security checks, with airline personnel, or on the airplane. I will not be responsible for your fate, nor will the group wait for you to be released from detention. This is serious business!

  * Although we will be in the islands for 25 days, it will be necessary for us to pack light. For practical reasons (especially limitations of space in our rented vehicles), you must limit your luggage to one carry-on piece and one checked piece. Your checked piece should be a medium-sized wheeled upright suitcase of the type that is so common these days, and your carry-on should be your field backpack. It will probably also be necessary for the group to have additional checked bags or parcels for snorkel gear. My partner and I will share one, and I urge you to make similar arrangements with other participants. I will try to coordinate this as our departure approaches. You should bring essential items, which I attempt to list below. I strongly recommend including your toiletries, a change of clothing, and a bathing suit in your carry-on, as well as your camera, snorkel mask, and anything else that you would be lost without. Be sure that your carry-on fits into the carry-on sizer that is standard in most US airports these days. When packing, be aware that there will be opportunities for doing laundry in most of our lodgings. There are things that we might use daily in civilization that will not be needed on the trip; the last trip I took with my brother, he brought a hair dryer, and the man is bald as a cue ball. When packing, remember that there are times when you will have to carry your gear.

  * It is to be hoped that weather conditions will be fairly benign. I expect the days to be warm (70s - 80s F) and the nights to be mild (50s -60s F). It will rain, and there is the potential for heavy rain. It will be significantly colder at higher elevations, and there is the potential for snow -- Haleakala summit is over 10,000 ft, and the upper slopes of Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea are above treeline. I recommend a variety of types of clothing, including shorts and light shirts for hiking, and warm clothing that can be worn in layers. A windbreaker or shell of some type is essential. See below for additional recommendations about clothing.

  * Photography is a good way to record both organisms you observe and places you visit. I prefer 35mm cameras that are mostly manual but that have an internal light meter and automatic shutter speed control. Disposable cameras and standard "point and shoot" 35mm cameras are not versatile enough for any serious photography. Some of the new autofocus cameras are very good, but are also very expensive. A good compromise for me is the Minolta XG-1 (or some equivalent model), which is a partially automatic body that can accept a variety of lenses. This type of camera is relatively inexpensive (they can be obtained used at camera shops or pawn shops), and is both reliable and rugged. I can give you more advice on this if you need it.

  * One of the most important parts of a successful field trip is being well-fed. My plan for meals on this trip is for us to buy things at grocery stores for breakfast and lunch, and to have dinner either at our lodging or at restaurants. Most mornings we will be getting up early and leaving for our field excursion for the day. Breakfast will consist of fruit, bagels or rolls or muffins, or maybe some cold cereal if we have a refrigerator. Lunch will consist of various types of "trail food". Most of us will want to make sandwiches, and we will have a variety of ingredients for these. We will also have chips, fruit, crackers, etc. that travel well. If we have time and the facilities, I will cook some evening meals. I will prepare interesting, tasty, and healthy fare. Eating out all the time gets old, and the food is usually less that healthy. Some evenings we will eat out at whatever restaurant we can find that is mutually agreeable, or we might choose up sides and go to several places. My hope is that the course budget will cover all meals, but we might have to be conservative, especially in our choice of restaurants. My plan at this point is to give each participant a daily allotment for evening meals in restaurants, which may get larger or smaller as the trip progresses, depending on our budget.

  * The fees for this course cover air and ground transportation (excluding transportation to and from DFW), lodging, most meals, snorkel boats, whale-watching, and park access fees. Additional out-of-pocket expenses will include any books, clothing, souvenirs, etc. that you want to purchase, and scuba diving expenses.

It is important to have an inkling of the language of a place that you visit,
and although Hawaii is officially one of the United States, there are many
words of the native tongue that are commonly used. Below is a smattering of
some useful ones:

Aloha: this is a universal greeting which is also used when parting. It also
connotes a feeling of gleeful friendliness (as in "the aloha spirit"). It is
easy to have this feeling in Hawaii. There is nothing in English with a
similar meaning; the closest we can come is "howdy".

Mahalo: translates essentially as "thank you".

Haole: (pronounced howlee) -- an American (usually white).

Makai: a direction, meaning "toward the sea". On an island, north and south
are less important than where the ocean is.

Mauka: the opposite direction, meaning "toward the mountain".

Kona: the leeward side of an island. Winds in Hawaii generally blow from
northeast to southwest, which causes dramatic differences in climatic
conditions on different sides of the islands. In general, the northeast,
windward side is very wet, and the southwest, leeward side (in the rain shadow
of the mountains) is dry.

The Big Island: refers to Hawaii (the island) to distinguish it from Hawaii
(the entire state).

Haleakala: the volcano on Maui. The name means "house of the sun" and is
pronounced ha lay ah ka LAH, with the emphasis on the last syllable.

Pele: the goddess of the volcanoes. Halema'uma'u in Kilauea on the Big Island
is the traditional home of Pele. Do not remove any lava rocks from any islands
-- this irritates Pele, which has unfortunate consequences.

Pahoehoe: a form of solidified lava. Pahoehoe (pronounced pa hoy hoy) is the
smooth, ropy-looking, massive lava that results from lava flows.

A'a: another form of solidified lava. A'a (pronounced like it looks -- ah ah)
is rough, jagged lava that results from frothy or bubbly lava. Be very careful
walking on a'a, or you will find out why it is called that.

Nene: the Hawaiian state bird, descended from the Canada goose. Obnoxious like
a goose also.

Humuhumunukunukuapua'a: the Hawaiian state fish ( _Rhinecanthusrectangulus_ ),
whose English name is the "reef triggerfish".  


See the NPS site on the [Hawaiian
language](http://pigpen.itd.nps.gov/havo/language.htm) for more information.

**Things you must bring:**

a photo ID or passport (for airport security).

good hiking boots with adequate ankle support, and that fit well. Plan on a
break-in period before the trip.

good hiking socks -- I recommend at least 2 pairs of Thorlos or something
equivalent, designed for hiking, and made with acrylic and wool.

snorkel gear -- a mask that fits well is essential; the snorkel can be
something simple, and the fins should fit your feet well.

bathing suits -- I recommend two that are comfortable and durable -- this is
not a fashion show.

appropriate clothing -- be prepared for both warm and cool conditions. Hiking
can usually be done in shorts and a light shirt, but long pants and warm
clothes are necessary for night time and at higher elevations. I recommend a
pair of convertible pants (the legs zip off to make shorts). I plan to wear
jeans and my boots on the plane, so that I do not have to pack those items. I
recommend a sweatshirt, sweater, or polarfleece garment for warmth, and a
windbreaker as a shell. Other clothing should pack small and be light to
carry.

rain gear -- I recommend something lightweight and durable, not an umbrella
nor a plastic Sears poncho. A rain jacket can double as a wind shell.

backpack of some kind; preferably a day-pack that is both comfortable and
sturdy.

field notebook (described above), lined paper and pens for writing, blank
paper and pencils for drawing.

tennis shoes or other comfortable shoes for when we are not hiking.

hat -- you may exercise your own preference here, but you will need something
that protects your head from sun and rain, and one that is warm. I usually
bring two.

flashlight with extra batteries.

sunglasses

personal toiletry items including any prescription medicines. I recommend
bringing copies of essential prescriptions, including those for eyeglasses (if
necessary).

Things you should bring:

a copy of your "proof of medical insurance" card

extra cash (I recommend about $200 - $250, mostly in travelers checks) and a
credit card (if available) for emergencies

a phone card if you think you will need it

an insulated mug with your name on it

a camera with plenty of film and extra batteries

sport sandals or other shoes you can get wet (for aquatic work).

a small spare bag for items purchased that will not fit into your luggage

binoculars (preferably small, lightweight ones). The college has a limited
number of binoculars which can be checked out.

spare glasses or contact lenses

sunscreen and aloe vera sunburn lotion

plastic bags/mesh bag for dirty clothes

reading material for time in the airplane (in addition to required reading
material described above). It is a good idea to form "trading groups" for
novels.

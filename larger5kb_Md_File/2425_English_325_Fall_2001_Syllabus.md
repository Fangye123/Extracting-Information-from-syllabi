_Office hours_ :



My office is A467 Robinson, in the Department of English.   Telephone number
993-1196 (voice mail is at that number too).   E-mail me at
[hbergman@gmu.edu.](mailto:hbergman@gmu.edu.) My office hours this semester
are Tuesdays from 1:30-3 and (most often) by appointment.



_Requirements_ :



We will discuss all this at some length, but let me say that I will ask you
to:

1.      Attend all three class meetings in each week faithfully (Tues 12, Thurs 12, and Wed 5:55 in LH1).  This is extremely important to me.  Being there is what qualifies you to get a grade.

2.       Do the reading fully and on time, and be well prepared to discuss it thoroughly with the class.   Quizzes and in-class exercises are possible.

3.      Attend performance of "Nathan the Wise"; attend showing of movie "O."

4.      Complete a total of eight Short Papers (1 page) written outside of class 

5.      Write four Major Papers (4-5 pp.).  One will also have a draft due.  (50% of grade)

6.      Submit 9 responses to the Recitations to the Townhall system (required, but ungraded).

7.      Take a final examination  (35% of grade)



The course is _six-credits_ (DOUBLE the usual): hence the level of commitment
must be very high.



_Policies and Grading:_



The following rules go without saying, but I'll say them anyway:

1)  All work you do for the course must be entirely your own and done for this
course alone.   Sources you use must be properly credited (MLA Style).
University Honor Code applies.   My policy for violation is failure in the
course; University may take further action.  

2) You cannot receive a passing grade in the course if you have not attended
classes and completed all assignments.  

4) Late work is not acceptable.  (Contact me before due date with serious
problems).  "Late" means anything not turned in at the beginning of class on
the due date.

5) Please keep _copies_ of all work you hand in to prevent assorted disasters.



Final grade will be one of the following: A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, D and F.

_A; A-:_   These grades are awarded for superior understanding of all
concepts, for sophisticated presentation in written work, and for forceful and
imaginative interpretation and analysis.  This is work from which a teacher
learns.   _B+; B; B-:_ These grades are awarded for above average mastery of
the concepts, for clear and thoughtful written work, and for convincing
interpretation and analysis.   _C+; C:_   These grades are awarded for
sufficient mastery of the concepts, for competent written work, and for
reasonable interpretation and analysis.  _D:_ This grade is awarded for less
than satisfactory mastery of the concepts, for poorly conceived and executed
written work, and for weak interpretation and analysis.   There are usually
serious writing problems in the written work.  _F:_ This grade is awarded for
work unacceptable as college level work.   (English Majors must earn a grade
of "C" or better to use this course toward the major).





_Using Townhall_

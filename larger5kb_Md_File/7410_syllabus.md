##  Course Description

History 5 is an introduction to Europe from around 1500 to the present, or
from the suppression of the church-centered civilization of Latin Christendom
to the era of European integration. Modern Europe, which comprises roughly the
peoples and states of western Eurasia, is in world-historical perspective
characterized: **economically** , by the importance of trade and manufacturing
relative to agriculture; **socially** , by the relative weakness of kinship
and the importance of class formations based on wealth and power;
**politically** , by relatively small, highly coordinated national states and
large overseas empires; and **culturally** , by linguisitic diversity and
socially and nationally specific religious and other cultural communities.
Since modern European history includes the rise of seaborne empires, the
formation of a global economy, and colonialism and decolonization,
considerable attention will be given to Europe's relations with non-European
states and peoples.

##  
Course Goals

The first goal is to provide an up-to-date, university-level acquaintance with
the history of modern Europe from a North American (i.e., non-European)
perspective. Equally important is the organization of discussions, based on
common readings in the sections, and the writing and criticism of papers and
exams.  


##  Grading Policy

The Mid-Term exam will count for 20%, and the Final Exam for 30% of the final
grade. The remainder of the grade will be based on work in the discussion
section. The two papers, each counting for 20% of the course grade, are due:
1st paper, February 18; 2nd paper, April 29. The remaining 10% of the course
grade will be based on participation in section.

##  
Sections

History 5 represents a compromise between two goals: to open basic historical
knowledge to as many Berkeley students as possible, and to personalize the
experience in small groups. Two lectures weekly create frameworks for the
knowledge you gain from the readings and the sections, while section leaders
help you to bring people, ideas, and events from original sources. Sources are
the fundamental stuff of all historical writing, from the most recondite and
specialized monographs to historical novels, and one of our chief goals is to
learn how to tell fact from fiction.  
**Regular attendance in section is required for the course. Section
assignments will be changed only in urgent cases, supported by documentation
(work schedule, etc.) and made in writing to the section leader into whose
section the transfer is requested.**

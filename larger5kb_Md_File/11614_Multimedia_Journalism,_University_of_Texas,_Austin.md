**Description:**

The primary goal of this course is to prepare journalism students to work for
news enterprises on the Internet, taking advantage of its multimedia
presentation capabilities. Most of the traditional media outlets around the
world have started editions on the World Wide Web, while new start-up
publications have created Web-only operations. In fact, we have never seen in
the history of communication such a velocity in the expansion of a new medium.
The impact of this phenomenon on journalism has been tremendous. The Internet
is not only a wonderful tool for journalists to find information, but it is
also an excellent medium by which to disseminate journalistic products.  
  
Our main focus is understanding of the Internet phenomenon and its impact on
journalism, with special attention to the search for a new style of narrative
- one that could take advantage of the simultaneous use of text, hypertext,
photos, images in motion, audio and databases. We will produce an online
publication prototype in class, although we are going to be limited by the
technical resources available.  
  
In addition to working on the production of a prototype publication, students
will analyze and discuss the origins of online journalism and its current
trends. Themes will include the history of online journalism, the pre-Web
experiments, the evolution of the Internet, the online publications, the
adaptation process from traditional media to the online environment, the
search for a business model, the audiences, the main characteristics of the
new medium, etc. We will also work on breaking news on the Web and discuss the
job opportunities in online journalism.

Important Note:

This class is not about computers or software, and instead will focus on the
ways journalists can use this new technology. However, it is important that
students acquire the basic tools of Internet publishing. Some elementary to
intermediate software knowledge will be provided in class, including HTML.

**Assignments:  
  
** There are several assignments in this class. Late submissions will not be
accepted without a serious and verifiable medical or personal excuse.

1) _Students must set up their own Web sites by Thursday, Feb. 7._. All course
assignments must be completed and posted on the student Web sites. There will
be no use of real paper in this course.

The personal Web page belongs to the student, but for the purposes of this
class it is required that each site contains the following links:

a) "Multimedia Journalism Assignments" (a space that each student has to
create in her/his site to post the assignments required in this course);  
b)The UT [School of Journalism](http://journalism.utexas.edu/);  
c) The student's resume, and  
d) The [class home page](http://www.utexas.edu/coc/journalism/onlinejou).  
  
2) _The class will also develop an online project. More details about this
assignment will appear as the class situation is evaluated._

  
3) Students must write a research paper about a subject that will be discussed
in class. The subject must address the major points of the content in the
course, and provide some depth of analysis based on the fundamentals drawn
from lectures and notes. The paper must be a minimum of 2,000 words and
include sources and a bibliography. **Students must also design their papers
and post them on the Web**. Students are encouraged to integrate multimedia
elements into their papers.  
  
Students will give an oral presentation of their papers, to be followed by
class discussion. The papers must be posted on the students' Web sites on the
day of the presentation (see [calendar](calendar.html)).  
The research paper must be written in academic style, regardless of the
creativity of the design. Each paper should begin with a thesis statement,
also known as an argument. Students must explain the argument briefly in a
strong introduction and organize the rest of the paper to support the thesis.
Students must summarize the paper in the conclusions and show how they have
proven their argument.

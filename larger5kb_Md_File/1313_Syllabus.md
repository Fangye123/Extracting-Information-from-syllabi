#### II. Course Description

An historical survey tracing the continuing development of civilization from
the beginning of the seventeenth century to the present day, with attention to
the governmental, social, religious, economic, political, intellectual, and
aesthetic movements and activities that contributed to their development, with
special consideration of the movements, idelogies, revolutions, and wars that
helped to shape modern history.

History 120 is the second half of the World History sequence. This course is
designed to help students improve their proficiency in reading, writing and
critical thinking. It offers students additional opportunities to develop
skills in note-taking, word-processing, library research, and public speaking.

The most pervasive theme of the modern historical period is the rise of the
West and its influence on the rest of the world through a combination of
domination, imitation, and adaptation. History 120 investigates the reasons
for this influence and its effect on other world civilizations.

History 120 reflects a global emphasis in its representation of major
civilizations and their contributions to the human experience. The course
emphasizes the social history of civilizations through the ages and around the
world, recreating the everyday life of ordinary people in the context of their
economic, political, intellectual, cultural, religious, and geographic
environment.

#### III. Objectives and Competencies

Because many of the students in this course will become teachers in the North
Carolina public schools, the following goals are taken from the [NC Department
of Public Instruction Goals and Objectives for the Social Studies Curriculum
in World
History](http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/Curriculum/socialstudies/SocStuSecondaryWHist.html).
Students will of course be expected to realize these goals at a collegiate
rather than a secondary level. Competencies from the DPI Curriculum Guidelines
for Middle Grades Social Studies teachers are referenced by the numbers in
brackets. Upon completion of this course students should be able to

Exam Make-up/Retake Date  |   | Apr 26, 6:00-7:20 p.m. | Apr 27, 12:00-12:50
p.m.  
  
*The four exams in this class make up 80% of the grade.  The exam with the lowest score will be given half the weight of the other exams; in other words, three exams will count about 22.85% and one 11.42%.

**With the exception of the Internet Skills assignment, which each student
must complete individually, homework assignments for this class must be
completed in study teams of four students each. Each student receives an
individual grade for his/her portion of the assignment.  However, teams can
earn up to 5 bonus points for evidence of teamwork.  As with the exams, the
homework with the lowest score will be given half the weight of the other
homework exercises; four of the exercises will count about 4.4% of the final
grade, the other about 2.2%.

Grades and their numerical equivalents are as follows:

**Numeric Score** | **Letter Grade**  
---|---  
92 or above | A  
83-91 | B  
73-82 | C  
64-72 | D  
63 or below | F  
Excessive absence |

WN  
Incomplete |

I  
  
Class participation may decide borderline cases. Poor attendance can lead to a
grade of WN.

After each of the first three exams, students will receive a **Student Grade
Report** detailing grades received, attendance, and participation. Students
with questions about anything on their Report should discuss them with the
instructor.

**Incompletes** are granted only if the student is unable to complete specific
course requirements for reasons beyond his or her control. Incompletes are
granted only if the student contacts the instructor before the end of the
term, and then only if the instructor agrees that the circumstances merit an
incomplete. The student and the instructor must complete an Incomplete Grade
Form.

####  VII. Course Policies

Assignments are outlined under Evaluation above.

##### Late Work

Students are responsible for all work assigned in this class, whether or not
they are present. Assignments must be completed on time. **Late work** will be
penalized one letter grade unless you have a good excuse, and no assignments
will be accepted more than one week late.

#####  Rewrites, Retakes, Make-ups

Students may **rewrite** one homework exercise. They may also **retake** one
exam. The retake/rewrite grade replaces the original grade. No rewrites or
retakes are permitted on the final examination or on any work due the last
week of class. **Make-ups** for missed examinations are given at the
discretion of the instructor. The absence must be excused under the same
conditions as absence from class (see Attendance). Students may make up
**one** missed exam during the term. There will be one retake/make-up date for
the course. Students may only retake or make-up an exam at that time (see
Assignments for due date). As an alternative to a retake or a make-up,
students may complete one of the Extra Credit/Alternative Assignment paper
(see below).

#####  Extra Credit/Alternative Assignment

Students may choose to complete one of the Extra Credit/Alternative Assignment
papers instead of an exam. They may also write a paper to replace their lowest
exam score. Finally, students may choose to write one of the papers as a
retake or make-up of an exam. No student may write more than two papers. See
Assignments for due dates.

##### Attendance

This course follows the university's attendance policy:

> **Students who accumulate unexcused absences exceeding 10% of the course
meetings hours will be withdrawn from the course.**

For  classes that meet three days each week, that means **five (5)** absences.
For classes meeting two days a week, that means **four (4)** absences. In
addition,

> **students who miss two consecutive classes without an excuse will also be
withdrawn from the course.**

Students may appeal withdrawal for nonattendance, but approval of appeals is
at the discretion of the instructor. See the Catalog for further information
and the Course Schedule for deadlines.

**Tardiness** disrupts the class and is also discouraged.

> **Any student arriving after the instructor has finished calling the roll
may be considered tardy, and two incidents of unexcused tardiness count as one
unexcused absence.**

**IMPORTANT** : Attendance is taken at the **beginning** of each class. Any
student not present when roll is taken is considered **absent**. Students who
arrive late should speak to the instructor at the end of class to ensure that
they are marked tardy rather than absent.

If the instructor uses a **seating chart** , students are required to sit in
their assigned seats unless given permission to sit elsewhere. Failure to sit
in one's assigned seat may cause the instructor to mark the student absent.

Students are expected to remain in class until they are dismissed, unless they
have received prior permission from the instructor to leave early. Early
departure from class will be treated the same as tardiness--two such
occurrences will constitute an unexcused absence.

Excuses for tardiness and absence will be accepted at the discretion of the
instructor. Written documentation may be required, especially for lengthy or
repeated problems. Students should bring excuses to the instructor's attention
as soon as possible--before the event if it is foreseeable, immediately after
if not. Excuses for tardiness should be discussed with the instructor
immediately after the class for which the student is tardy; excuses for
absence should be discussed the first day the student returns to class. With
rare exceptions, **excuses will not be accepted after these dates**.

#####  Participation

All students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the assigned
material. This implies that students should read the material before class.
Perfect comprehension is not expected at the beginning of class, but students
should be familiar with the topic and the major points, and they should have
identified areas they do not understand well enough to ask focused,
intelligent questions about them. The instructor reserves the right to give
unannounced quizzes or other assignments to check students' preparation.

There are three principal ways students can participate:

  1. by asking and answering questions in class, 
  2. by contributing to their team, and 
  3. by discussing courses material with the instructor during office hours. 

The instructor keeps a record of participation, which can decide borderline
grades.

Students are expected to observe normal courtesy in class. They are expected
to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to refrain from
personal conversation, and to avoid any other behavior that disturbs others. A
student who does not observe these courtesies may be asked to leave the room.

##### Academic Honesty

Students should be aware that a university is a community of scholars
committed to the discovery and dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without
freedom to investigate all materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting
findings, and proper acknowledgment of credit, such a community can not
survive. Students are expected to adhere to the highest traditions of
scholarship. Infractions of these traditions, such as plagiarism (cheating),
are not tolerated. Misrepresenting someone else's words or ideas as one's own
constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism occurs, the instructor has
the right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks appropriate. One
guideline holds that the first offence results in failure of the assignment,
the second offence in failure of the course.

Team assignments require a special note. Each member of the study team is
expected to contribute to the assignment. Every member of the team gets the
same grade for the assignment. A student who does not contribute is
essentially misrepresenting someone else's words and ideas as one's own. This
is academic dishonesty, and it will be treated as such.

#### VIII. Outline

Readings for specific dates will be announced in class. They may vary slightly
from the following table as the pace of the class dictates. Students are
responsible for keeping up with any such changes, which will also be posted on
this web site. Chapter references are to Upshur, _World History._

The Unit links in the left navigation bar take you to lecture notes for the
various topics listed. Links will be available at the beginning of each
section. **WARNING** : These notes are for the most part outlines only. They
are very rough, and they are no substitute for class attendance! They are
intended to remind students of important topics and points covered in class.

#### IX. Bibliography

A recent controversy in the historiography of early modern world history
involves the relative "progress" of Europe and "stagnation" of Asian economies
in the period between 1600 and 1800 CE.  The traditional account characterizes
the early modern period as that during which Europeans establish a global
trade network that drives the world economy and gives Europe dominance over
non-European countries. That dominance is held to be the result of many
progressive elements in modern European culture: capitalism, modern science
and technology, the modern state, etc. A recent account of modern world
history that more or less follows in this tradition is that of David Landes in
_The Wealth and Poverty of Nations._

An increasing amount of research is calling into question the alleged
superiority of Europe by finding more and more of the supposedly unique
qualities of European civilization in other civilizations. China, in
particular, had a robust and dynamic economy well into the eighteenth century,
an economy that was much larger than that of any European country. This
research is synthesized in _ReOrient_ , by Andr¨¦ Gunder Frank.

Eminent world historian William McNeill wrote an insightful if critical review
of Landes for the _New York Review of Books_.

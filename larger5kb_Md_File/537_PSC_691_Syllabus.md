## Course Description

This course familiarizes students with fundamental issues and concerns that
underlie the practices of inquiry in political science. To this end, we will
contrast various contemporary schools of metascience, the prescriptions of
which condition those practices.

In previous offerings of this course, a few students expressed the anxiety
that the course fails to treat one or another of their most cherished
theoretical formulations. This is purposeful. As our aim is to recover the
metatheories (or theories of theory) that underpin such theories. Specific
theories of political action will naturally arise in discussion, of course.
However, if we are to achieve the goal of understanding the bases available to
us for theory construction, we necessarily must restrict our focus to
metatheory.

## Books

Each student should obtain a copy of each of the following books. They have
been ordered through the Orange Student Bookstore in Marshall Square.

  * Becker, Howard S. _Writing for Social Scientists_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1986. 
  * Dallmayr, Fred R., and Thomas A. McCarthy, eds. _Understanding and Social Inquiry_. Notre Dame: Notre Dame University Press, 1977. 
  * Kuhn, Thomas S. _The Structure of Scientific Revolutions_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962. 
  * Lakatos, Imre, and Alan Musgrave, eds. _Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970. 
  * Magee, Bryan. _Philosophy and the Real World_. LaSalle, Indiana: Open Court, 1985. 
  * Putnam, Hilary. _Pragmatism_. Oxford: Blackwell, 1995. 
  * Rescher, Nicholas. _Dialectics: A Controversy-Oriented Approach to the Theory of Knowledge_. Albany: SUNY Press, 1977\. 
Additional readings will be distributed in class and/or placed on reserve in
Bird Library.

The Dallmayr and McCarthy reader may be out of print. If so, copies of our
readings will be placed on reserve.

The Becker book will not be a focus of our seminar discussions. It is assigned
because students in previous years have found it very useful in overcoming
social and psychological barriers to effective writing. Read it at your
leisure (ha!). You will find it both enjoyable and helpful.

## Course Requirements

Each student will produce a final paper that reviews the intellectual
accomplishments of a faculty member in the Maxwell School. These reviews serve
two purposes. First, they exercise intellectual constructs discussed over the
course of the semester. Second, they encourage students to familiarize
themselves with the intellectual pursuits of a faculty member, perhaps one
with whom they wish to work.

To expose all students to a range of these intellectual pursuits, and also to
exercise students' skills in oral presentation, each student will present in
class a preliminary report of their final paper. These presentations will
follow an in-class examination. This examination will ask very general essay
questions pertaining to issues discussed in class and in the readings.

Students are required to select in advance the faculty member whose work they
will review, and students will clear their selection with the instructor.
Consent is required in order to ensure that no two students will review the
work of the same faculty member. Students are encouraged to discuss their
reviews in preparation with the faculty members whose work they will review.

## Grading Criteria

Final grades for this course will be assigned on the following basis.

  * Examination (30%). 
  * Final paper (30%). 
  * Presentation (20%). 
  * Participation (20%).

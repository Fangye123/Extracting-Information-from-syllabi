_Texts_

> Psychology: The Adaptive Mind (2nd Edition) by James S. Nairne.  
>  Study Guide for Psychology: The Adaptive Mind by Janet D. Proctor

_Course Requirements_

_Exams_. All of the exams will be closed-book, objective exams, containing
multiple-choice, fill-in-the-blank, and short-answer questions. The final exam
is cumulative (i.e., it will test all of the material covered in the course).

_Exam Schedule_ :  
  Exam 1 | September 27  
---|---  
Exam 2 | November 1  
Final | December 19 (An "alternate" final will not be given.)  
  
_Make-up Exams._ No make-up tests will be given; no exceptions. I will be
happy to reschedule an exam if you contact me at least 24 hours before the
time of the exam and have a legitimate reason for being absent from the
university on the regular day of the exam.

_Thought Papers._ You are required to write three  "thought" papers. These
papers should be concise but eclectic, critical but constructive responses to
an issue or a problem discussed in class or in the text during the preceding
4-5 weeks (since the last such paper). Topics will be assigned at least one
week in advance. Each paper should be two pages, typed, double-spaced. Late
papers will not be accepted. Collectively, these three papers will be worth
15% of your course grade.

_Pop Quizzes:_ A small number of brief pop quizzes may be given at
unpredictable times during the semester. They will count as extra credit.

_Laboratory Requirement._ For a description of the laboratory requirement,
please consult the handout entitled,  "[Laboratory Requirement in Introductory
Psychology.](labreq.htm)" Please note that all students must satisfy the
laboratory requirement by completing a total of 12 "units," either by
participating in experiments ("Option 1") or by writing research reports
("Option 2") or both ("Option 3"). The procedures for signing up for
experiments are described in the document, "experimetrix.pdf." The cost of not
completing this requirement may be severe (see below).  **Please note that no
experiments will be conducted after Tuesday, December 11th, and that all
research reports (Option 2) must be turned in by 4 P.M. on Tuesday, December
11th.   **Research reports should be turned in to the professor or the TAs.

_Grading_

All of your work will be graded on a standard decile scale:  
  93% and up | A  
---|---  
90-92% | A-  
87-89% | B+  
83-86% | B  
80-82% | B-  
77-79% | C+  
73-76% | C  
70-72% | C-  
67-69% | D+  
63-66% | D  
60-62% | D-  
59% and below | F  
  
Your course grade will be computed by taking the weighted average of your
grades on the exams and the thought papers:  
  Papers (3): | 15%  
---|---  
Exam 1: | 25%  
Exam 2: | 25%  
Final: | 35%  
  
Your final course grade will be adjusted downward if you do not fulfill the
laboratory requirement: Your course average, whatever it is, will be reduced
by 1% for each unit below 12. For example, if you have an average of 80% (B-)
at the end of the semester and are missing 1 unit, your final average will be
reduced to 79% (C+); if you are missing 4 units, your final average will be
reduced to 76% (C); if you are missing all 12 units, your course average will
be 68% (D+); etc.

_Honors System_

All work should be conducted under the Honor Code. All work should be your
own. No help from other people or from source material should be available
during the exams.

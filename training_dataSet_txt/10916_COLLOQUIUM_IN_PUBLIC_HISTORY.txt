                    COLLOQUIUM IN PUBLIC
HISTORY
 
Dr. Rodney
Carlisle - Armitage 354
History
Department phone: 225 6080
Fall, 1998
email:  carlisle@crab.rutgers.edu
 
            This course is designed to introduce
the student to a number of ways in which the discipline of History is applied
both by academics and by non-academic practitioners.  Through readings and discussions, students develop familiarity
with several basic trends in recent historiography, and how they have affected
the profession.  After a review of some
aspects of recent literature on the practice of history, each student will
chose a particular public historian, review his or her career and works, and
present both an oral and a written evaluation of the author's approach.  The student should choose a living author,
and should arrange to interview the author in person or by telephone.  See below for details on interview.  If the interview is arranged in person, it
can serve as an introduction to some of the methods of oral history technique,
which we will discuss in the course. 
For the purposes of this syllabus, the evaluation of the individual
historian will be called an "Historiographic Note."
 
            Each week through weeks 2-9, each
student is to submit a single copy of a 3-4 page written commentary on the
readings, called a "Commentary" in this syllabus.  This section of the course will serve to
introduce new graduate students to the colloquium method of instruction.  For new and more advanced students, the
writing exercises may help sharpen analytic and writing skills.  All should gain a picture of some of the
current trends in history and public history from these readings, their
discussion, and the Commentaries.
            
            Guidelines for preparing both the
Commentaries and the Historiographic Note are presented later in this syllabus.

                              GUIDELINES
  
GUIDELINE FOR COMMENTARIES ON READINGS
 
R.1.In general the focus in the written Commentary
should center on these questions: 
            How
do the authors define a good approach to history?
            What
is the underlying central thesis of the work? 

            What
are the strengths and weaknesses of the argument as                                                      presented? 
            What
ideological positions are reflected in the authors' approaches to                         the past? 
            What
insights from the authors are particularly valuable?
            What
limitations do you detect in the authors' approach?            
 
R.2. Good style, of course, dictates that you not
cover these questions as if they were simple question and answer
propositions.  You should write a
coherent essay addressing these and other aspects of the work you think are
pertinent. You should strive to express your own reactions, expressing both
your positive and negative responses to the questions in R.1.
 
R.3. The manuscript should be no longer than 3 to 4
pages, double spaced.
 
R.4. You should use a word processor, should double
space, and should number your pages. 
References to page numbers in the works you cite may follow the MLA
style if you prefer.
 
GUIDELINE FOR THE "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY" OF
HISTORIOGRAPHIC NOTE
 
E.S.1. When
scheduled to make the oral presentation, each student is to bring a one page
"Executive Summary" of his or her oral presentation of the
Historiographic Note for distribution to the group.  Prepare sufficient copies of the Executive Summary for all
members of the class.  The oral
presentation will be limited to 20 to 35 minutes, to be followed by a discussion
up to 10 minutes.
 
The Executive Summary should:
E.S.2. Succinctly
present the chronology of the historian's life: birth, education, career.
 
E.S.3. Present a
list of the publications of the author (if any), with those you are discussing
in detail marked with an asterisk.
 
E.S.4. Present a
paragraph summarizing the historian's ideology, slant, or approach.  In this paragraph you should give an
indication of the historian's self-image. 
 
 
GUIDELINE FOR ORAL PRESENTATION 20 TO 35 MINUTES
 
O.P.1.   Using
the Executive Summary, you should make clear for the class what type of
historian is the subject of your study. 
You should be familiar with some of his or her works (written or other)
and be prepared to discuss them, and to answer questions about your
subject.  Those scheduled later in the
semester will have the advantage of having completed the oral interview, and
should be able to give the class an impression of the historian's personality
and character.  In one sense, your oral
presentation is much like a "briefing" presented at staff meetings of
corporate and government organizations. 
Do not think of your presentation as a lecture.
 
O.P.2.   After
the presentation, you should be sure to make notes on any questions, comments,
suggestions, and ideas received in the class and work to incorporate useful
elements in your final written version. 
Your ability to incorporate suggestions will be part of the judgment on
the final written product.
 
WRITTEN PRESENTATION OF HISTORIOGRAPHIC NOTE
 
H.N.1.   The
final written version of the Historiographic Note is to be submitted in the
14th week; the due date will be announced. 
The written treatment of the historian chosen should, as a minimum,
accomplish the following:
 
H.N.2.   Give
biographical details, including education and publication interests.
                        
H.N.3.   The
historian's point of view and style of historical work should be examined.  In order to explore these questions, the
student should present a close examination of two or more of the historian's
works. If the historian's work has taken the form of exhibits, displays,
programs, or other non-written historical products, those should be analyzed.
In particular, such issues as these are appropriate:
            
            What
is the historian's point of view, on political/social issues?
            
            What
types of sources does he or she use?
            
            How
well does the historian measure up to the standards set by Barzun and               Graff?
            
            What
sort of audience/client is the historian writing for?
            
            How
receptive is the historian to such techniques as:  
            quantification, oral history,
artifact/non-paper documents, social perspectives,                       use of modern tools of the trade including
computer, photocopy, tape-             recorder,
or on-line research?
            How
does the historian interpret the material he or she works with?
 
 
H.N. 4.  As to
length, each student must define an appropriate treatment.  In general              a
paper under 8 pages would probably be much too short for such a                                 topic; one over
20 pages would probably be more extensive than                necessary.  Try to aim at about 10-15 pages for the main
body of the                   paper.  
 
Each student is to prepare a direct transcript of at
least three pages of the tape to include as an appendix to the paper. You can
choose any section of the tape to transcribe. The transcript should indicate
the questioner with your initials, the respondent with their initials, and show
the date of the interview. You may leave grammar and syntax uncorrected in this
transcript.
 
 
WRITTEN MATERIAL IN GENERAL
 
            Applicable
to Commentaries, Historiographic Note, and Executive Summary:
 
W.1.    Students
should use a word processor.  Beginning
students may submit initial papers typed. 
The college computer center provides word processing equipment, and has
evening hours.
 
W.2.    All
material should be double spaced (including block quotes, endnotes, and
bibliographic material).
 
W.3.    All
pages should be numbered.
 
W.4.    All
material should be error-free.
 
W.5.    Style
should follow The Chicago Manual of Style, although in the commentaries,
MLA style for cited material is acceptable.
 
W.6.    Style
or other errors identified in early papers should not occur in later papers.  
W.7.    You
should learn to identify any weaknesses you have in style and to edit your own
work so as to correct them.
 
If this is your first graduate course, you should
recognize that these standards will be common to the rest of the graduate
program.
 
 
 
GUIDELINES FOR INTERVIEW
            
            It
is basic to human nature to be complimented to be interviewed regarding one's
life, works, and experiences.  Some
students find it a good method to call the subject, to describe their purposes,
and to arrange to call back or to meet at a more convenient time. Phone
interviews should be under 30 minutes; direct interviews under 75.  Face to face interviews are far preferable
to telephone interviews. Telephone interviews can be readily recorded (with the
subject's oral permission on the tape) with an inexpensive jack or suction-cup
microphone from Radio Shack.  
 
            The
actual interview can combine Oral History and journalistic interviewing
techniques.  It is almost essential to
tape the interview, which should only be done with the subject's awareness and
consent (whether over the phone or in person). 
One should have a list of questions, but have them open-ended.  Several useful questions are these:
"Tell me about your background." 
"How did you become an historian?" "Do you have any
particular models as historians that you admire or emulate?" "What
factors contributed to your choice of topics?"  "Tell me about how you actually go about conducting your
research." "How do you visualize your audience?"  You should supplement these ahead of time
with at least 20 more designed to address the career of the particular
historian you are interviewing; if the historian has published, you should have
read as much of the historian's materialas you can find and key your questions
to that material. If the historian's products take another form (such as
exhibits, restoration, organizational work, curatorship, or site preservation
and presentation) you should be as familiar as possible with that work.
 
             The student should be prepared to summarize
for the class lessons learned about the process of interviewing itself, while
conducting the interview.
 
            Further,
specific guidelines and "How-to" points regarding the oral interview
will be distributed in class. You should read and follow the guidelines as
discussed in Marty and Kyvig, Nearby History.
            
            Be
sure to design and obtain a signature on an oral history release form.  Keep the tape, prying out the tabs so that
the tape cannot be recorded over. If this is our first experience using a tape
recorder in a serious fashion, be sure to familiarize yourself with the working
of your equipment prior to the interview. 
 
GUIDELINES ON GRADING
 
The course grade will reflect these aspects:
 
            Quality
of written Commentaries
            Quality
of oral participation in class discussion
            Quality
of oral presentation of Historiographic Note
            Quality
of written Historiographic Note
 
The grade is not calculated by a formula with set
proportions.  However, the longer
Historiographic Note is a major component in the evaluation of your performance
in the course.
 
In general, these letter grades on work submitted
should convey the indicated meaning and are more or less standard in our
graduate program.
 
            A   = 
Expected level of performance at graduate level
            A-  = 
Work is at graduate level with only minor flaws
            B+  = 
Work shows good promise of success in graduate level
            B   = 
Acceptable work         
            B-  = 
Marginally acceptable work               
            C+
and below: Work is not at the graduate level; improvement is required.  Note that course grades in this range are
assigned to students who do not correct errors or style problems revealed in
early papers.  Thus errors that lead to
B or B- grades on early papers if occurring in later papers will lead to
progressively lower grades.
            Note
that two or more absences, excused or not, generally prevent a student from
achieving a B- or better grade. This standard is necessary because so much of
the learning and work of the course takes place in the class meetings.
 
            If
you have difficulty with an assignment, or if you do not understand either the
assignment or the evaluation of it, please feel free to contact me in the
office (by appointment) through email, or at the classroom.

> **Tips for Success**

>

> A key to succeeding at UT is wise and deliberate course selection. Time
management,  
>  financial responsibility and a dedication to learning will also contribute
to your success at UT.

>

> **Don't wait until the last minute for required classes**  
>  You should never postpone specific requirements until your final semester,
especially if you plan to graduate in the summer. You shouldn't assume that
just because you are graduating, you can get the class you need. If a class is
canceled or already filled to capacity by the time you register, your expected
graduation date may be jeopardized.

>

> **Research your options before calling TEX**  
>  If you are in doubt about a course, research professors and course content.
Ask instructors for a syllabus. Most departments make course descriptions
available in their main office or advising centers. The Sociology Advising
Office also maintains a binder with many departments' course descriptions.

>

> **If in doubt, check it out**  
>  When checking dates or pondering degree requirements, don't believe
everything your friends say! If in doubt, always consult an advisor or the
Dean's Office. If you have questions, you can e-mail the Sociology Advisors at
[socadvis@uts.cc.utexas.edu](mailto:socadvis@uts.cc..utexas.edu), or call
(512)232-6344.

>

> **Know your degree plan**  
>  [Sociology and general Liberal Arts degree requirements](degree.html) can
be found on the web. Request an advising audit after 60 hours of completed UT
or transferred coursework. This will show you which areas requirements remain
incomplete and serves as a double-check for transferred hours.  
>

>

> You should consider requesting an official degree check from the College of
Liberal Arts after you have completed about 75 hours of coursework. These are
like audits but indicate your official standing at UT. Advisors in the Dean's
Office will help you if you need to make changes or petition to waive certain
requirements.  
>

>

> **Consider taking 15 hours each semester**  
>  Many students take only 12 hours early on, and then rush to finish their
degrees in 4 or 4 1/2 years by taking heavy course loads in their last
semester or in the summer. Keep in mind that a 12 hour summer semester can be
brutal!

>

> **Don't be afraid to seek out assistance**  
>  College can be challenging for everyone. New academic expectations,
distance from family members, financial obligations, personal relationships,
and many more issues complicate students' lives. Fortunately, UT offers a wide
assortment of resources and offices to help students deal with nearly every
crisis. Successful students aren't the students without problems or bad luck-
they're the ones who seek out guidance when they need it.  
>

>

> If you find yourself in a bind, you can always contact your advisors in
Sociology. We will gladly offer our assistance as a resource to get you
started.  
>

>

> The [Learning Skills Center](http://www.utexas.edu/student/utlc/), located
in Jester Center, offers a wide variety of tutoring services and study skill
assistance. They have specially-trained tutors for math and science, writing
and languages. They even offer tutoring for SOC 317L, so if you are anxious
about your statistics requirement, you can get some assistance. Some of the
LSC's tutoring is free, and the rest is affordably priced.

>

> **Try something new**  
>  Use your time in college to do more than get a degree. You should use this
time to also to explore your career options, discover or indulge personal
interests, break old habits, and broaden your mind. Some ideas:

>

>> * Take courses to learn, not just because you have to.  
>  * Volunteer with a local agency or student organization.  
>  * Pick up a new hobby.  
>  * Expand your circle of friends to include people from all walks of life,
and a variety of cultures.  
>  * If you can afford it, plan a semester or a year abroad - and if not, try
taking cultural, history or language courses in an unfamiliar region of the
world.

>

> **Get to know your instructors**  
>  This cannot be overstated. Too many students allow themselves to be
intimidated by faculty. But by meeting with them during office hours or at
special events, you can learn more about their expectations, and perhaps find
yourself academically enriched. And if you don't meet with them now, who are
you going to ask when you need a letter of recommendation?

## Twentieth-Century American Social and Cultural History:  
American History Though Personal Narrative

This upper-division course will explore American life and culture from the  
1890's to the present, through personal accounts written by Americans of both  
genders and a variety of social and ethnic backgrounds. Autobiographies,
personal  
essays, and even fiction illustrate both everyday experience and the formation
of  
identity in American history. What did being American mean to African-American  
leaders, feminists of various generations, Mexican-Americans, student
protesters  
or professing Christians?  

Because many of the documents used in this course became "canonical works" in  
theiir own times, they provide a window onto American culture and its  
preoccupations. Such documents also suggest some larger, theoretical
questions:  
Who wrote autobiographies, and why? How did the authors of these  
works view their intended audiences, and how did they seek to convince them?
What  
cautions must the historian use if these accounts are to be considered
"evidence?"  
These are some of the questions to which we will be seeking answers in this
course.  

Although we will be using one textbook and several movies to add some context
and  
color to the primary sources, this is a reading-and-discussion class, not a
lecture class.  
All class periods depend on students having done the reading or other
assignments  
and making active contributions. For this reason, all students will be
required to  
prepare a one-page "think piece" on the week's assignment to use as a
springboard  
their own comments in class. I reserve the right to give a pop quiz on any day
I think i  
it useful or necessary.

##  Required readings

  
(books are available at the bookstore, some also in the library):

  * Jacob Riis, How the Other Half Lives 
  * Upton Sinclair, The Jungle 
  * W.E.B. Dubois, The Souls of Black Folk 
  * F. Scott Fitzgerald, This Side of Paradise 
  * Studs Terkel, Hard Times 
  * Malcolm X, Autobiography 
  * Norman Mailer, The Armies of the Night 
  * Maya Angelou, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings 
  * Richard Rodriguez, Hunger of Memory 
  * The Social Fabric (volume 2) 

Photocopies of other short narratives required in the course will be placed on
reserve  
in the library and will also be available, compiled as a course reader.  

## Evaluative Methods

Because this is a discussion class, each individual student's contributions
matter  
greatly. Attendance is mandatory and active participation highly recommended!  
Anyone absent from more than three class meetings will be dropped from the
class.  
Beyond that, student grades in this course are based equally on four
components.  

**I. Group critical reviews:**  
Students will be divided into teams for the purpose of conducting a critical
review  
on one of the books we discuss in class. Each team will need to do additional
critical  
reading, meet together to evaluate the book, and prepare a review statement  
to open the class session, as well as some questions for further discussion in
class.  
Grades will be based on how well the team prepared its material and how well
it  
engaged the class in discussion.  

**II. Short papers:**  
Each student individually must prepare a paper of 6-8 typewritten pages based
on  
some aspect of one of the personal narratives we will read in this class or on
another  
narrative chosen in consultation with me. Topics will depend on your interests  
and what appropriate source materials are at hand. All students are expected
to visit  
me during scheduled office hours to approve the topics for these projects.  
Style for these papers should conform to Turabian's manual. Finally, with
regard  
to these papers, plagiarism is a serious academic offense -- if you have any
doubts  
about the proper style and extent of citations, SEE ME FIRST.  

**III. Weekly think-pieces**  
Each student should record one page of personal responses to, or thoughtful
questions  
about, what we are reading in any given week. These will be due each Friday at
the  
end of class. They may be neatly hand-written, but will be evaluated as
seriously as  
any other assignment in the course. Each student may miss one think-piece
during the  
semester, no questions asked, but if no think-pieces are missed all will be
averaged  
into the final grade -- something which can really aid your final grade.  

**IV. Final Exam**  
There will be one final exam during finals week. It will be an essay exam
which will  
require you to think critically and integrate materials from throughout the
semester.  
The final exam will be open-book, open-notes, and a list of possible questions
will  
be distributed ahead of time. This means I am even more demanding when it
comes  
to the scope of your answers!

## Syllabus

**** This syllabus summarizes the scheduled activities of the mini-sabbatical.
It is organized by day (i.e., by class meeting) and assumes a four-day week
and six to eight hours of training time each day. The syllabus indicates the
day's chief topic or activity, what you should read to prepare for class, and
what you will do during class. The list of required readings is found after
the description of daily activities. If an assignment is due (for instance, if
journals will be collected) on a given day, that is indicated in **_bold
italic._** __ For bibliographic information, see the "Reading List" that

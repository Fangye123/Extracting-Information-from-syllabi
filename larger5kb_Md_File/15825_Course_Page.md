**Course Description** |

Introduction to the theory and implementation of computer graphics. The course
develops the mathematical basis for the computer representation of two and
three dimensional objects. Graphical programming assignments use the latest
graphics standards.  
  
Topics include:  
2D graphics primitives and attributes, fill algorithms, curved surfaces,
clipping algorithms, three dimensional viewing procedures, graphical I/O
devices, geometric transformations, computer graphics software, three-
dimensional object representations, visible surface algorithms, image
synthesis, ray tracing, radiosity, anti-aliasing, animation techniques, 3D
applications development, graphics workstations, virtual reality and virtual
environments.  
  
This course includes a laboratory component.

  
**Course Objectives** |

This course is designed to provide a comprehensive introduction to computer
graphics leading to the ability to understand contemporary terminology,
progress, issues, and trends. The interdisciplinary nature of computer
graphics is emphasized using a wide variety of examples and applications.
Course material is structured to meet the needs of both designers and users of
interactive computer graphics systems.  
  
At the end of this course, a student should:  
  
A. be familiar with the fundamental output primitives and  
     attributes of a graphics system;   
  
B. be familiar with the underlying mathematics of two and  
     three-dimensional graphics;   
  
C. be able to program a computer system to produce quality      graphics;  
  
D. be knowledgeable about graphics standards;  
  
E. be familiar with graphics hardware

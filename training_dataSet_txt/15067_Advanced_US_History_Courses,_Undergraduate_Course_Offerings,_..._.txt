African American Church and Black Liberation (new History 282).
Betty Collier-Thomas bcollier@astro.ocis.temple.edu
Race has been and is a central issue in America. Race has played a
very important role in the lives of black people and in the history of
African Americans. Historically the black church has been a central institution
for addressing pressing societal issues which threaten the existence of
black people. African Methodism, the first major black Christian organization
came into existence as a liberation movement and a protest against racism
and segregation in the Christian Church. Utilizing selected historic periods,
ie., antebellum, Civil War and Reconstruction, the 1920s and 1930s,
and the 1960s, this course will explore the meaning of freedom and
liberation as defined by the historic African American church and its leadership,
and will examine the different ideologies and strategies employed by church
leaders in addressing and resolving issues regarding the individual and
collective freedom of black people. American and African American history
will be used as the context, for examining issues, events, movements
and personalities important to understanding the role and impact of the
black church on the development of liberationist black thought and movements
during different periods.



America's Rise to Globalism (History 248; new History 290).
Richard Immerman
rimmerma@astro.ocis.temple.edu
This course will trace the contours of U.S. foreign policy from its
colonial origins through the destruction of the myth of isolationism produced
by the attack on Pearl Harbor. In other words, this course will trace the
rise of American globalism. Although the syllabus proceeds chronologically,
the lectures and readings emphasize thematic continuities and discontinuities.
These themes include the ideological, strategic, economic, cultural, and
racial influences on America's foreign relations; mission, manifest destiny,
and continental expansion; issues of war, peace, and security; crisis management
and mismanagement; the closing frontier and imperialism; Wilsonianism and
its critics; independent internationalism; and personal versus coalition
diplomacy. Because the study of diplomatic history is highly interpretative,
and the assigned studies reflect competing interpretations, all students
will be expected to question, comment upon, and yes, even criticize the
readings and lectures. In doing so, emphasis will be placed on recognizing
and assessing the strategies historians employ to collect and use evidence
in order to advance arguments. Nevertheless, there will not be any scheduled
discussion sessions (except for reviews prior to exams). They are too artificial
to promote genuine give and take and, as a consequence, are a counterproductive
use of valuable time. In lieu of set-piece discussions, students (ultimately
every student) will be required to "volunteer" at the start of each session
to summarize briefly and cogently the primary issues and
arguments covered in the preceding one. The remaining members of the class
should be prepared to comment on these summaries. In addition, all students
should be prepared as well to respond to questions and pointed references
to the readings--including the documents--that will be incorporated
into each session's lectures. Needless to say, therefore, assigned readings
should be completed prior to the appropriate class session, and students
should become accustomed to throwing caution to the wind. The syllabus
provides titles to weekly topics to allow flexibility sufficient to accommodate
the never-ending discussions but still indicate the intended material to
be covered.



American Cultural History (History 224; new History 272)
William Cutler
 wcutler@astro.ocis.temple.edu
This course will not attempt to cover all aspects of American cultural
history in one semester. Instead, it will examine some important themes
from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It will use material drawn
from elite and popular sources to explore the meaning of "culture" in a
diverse, democratic society. It will ask when and why Americans began to
think that there was such a thing as American culture. It will interrogate
this culture for some basic elements, taking into account the role of such
important features of American life as liberalism, pragmatism, patriotism,
consumerism, and modernism as well as the impact of science, technology,
the arts, and religion. It will distinguish between public culture, intended
for the edification of all, and the private cultures of different subgroups.



American Revolution and Republic (History 203; new History 266).
Howard Ohline holine@thunder.ocis.temple.edu
The central focus of History 266 is how the United States developed
from colonies of great Britain in the middle of the eighteenth century
to a nation with continental ambitions in the early nineteenth century.
We will study the historical origins of the Revolution, the "radical
character" of the revolution
as Americans struggled to establish republican governments and social institutions.
Special attention is given to the origins of the Constitution and the
struggle to define the Constitution in the early republic. Students will read various
books which focus on revolutionary history from different perspectives.
How did the Revolution alter the history of various groups within the United
States. What impact did it have on Americans? The course stresses understanding
the Revolution and the early Republic from a variety of historical interpretations.
Many of the skills emphasized in the class prepare students to think about
how historians solve historical problems. The solving of various historical
problems prepare students for graduate school and law school. Historical
thinking also prepares students to understand how history is used to address
current cultural and political issues. Students will write book review
essays in order to develop an understanding of how historians collect evidence,
construct historical interpretation and to develop their own interpretations
of historical events and personal writing skills.



Colonial America (History 201; new History 265).
Staff
Many important aspects of US society developed significantly before
the Revolution. The purpose of this course is to understand better how
this society took shape in that formative early era. The first classes
deal with some general issues that colonizers faced as they tried to form
and develop settlements in North America, and the way the English entered
into this process. Then characteristics of how three regions of the colonies
evolved are examined: the South, New England, and the Middle Atlantic.
The final few weeks of the course take up changes in political life, economics,
and culture that all parts of the colonies experienced in the 1700s and
which tended to bring them together towards becoming one new nation, though
not a nation without differences and conflicts.



Development of the Modern American City (History 226; new History 278).
Mark Haller haller@vm.temple.edu
The course examines the way that the American city has undergone two revolutionary
changes in the 135 years since the Civil War. In the mid- to late-19th
century the city went from a walking city to a streetcar city, altering
the basic social and economic geography. Then in the 20th century American
cities were transformed from streetcar cities to automobile cities, again
revolutionizing the cities' basic geography. The two transformations were
rooted in technological innovation in such areas as transportation, power,
and building construction. But the changes also depended upon what American
urban dwellers chose to make of the technologies. History, by examining
the way that American cities have changed in the past, can illuminate what
the American city has become and thus can provide insight into the factors
that should be taken into account in influencing the future of cities.



Gender, Race, and Ethnicity in America (new History 281).
Betty Collier-Thomas bcollier@astro.ocis.temple.edu
United States Women's history has come of age during the last two decades.
There is now a recognition that there is no universal women's experience,
rather American women come from diverse racial and ethnic, as well as cultural
backgrounds. Therefore women's experiences must be examined within the
larger context in which they have functioned. Utilizing the full context
of American history from the colonial period to 1980, this course will
explore the various ways in which gender, race and ethnicity, along with
other aspects of identity, have shaped the lives and experiences of women
in the United States. It will examine the complex relationships between
the construction of personal identities, the material realities of women's
lived experiences, cultural and ideological systems and social institutions.
Of necessity we must look at the bonds and conflicts among women and between
women and men. Issues of race, gender and ethnicity must be addressed within
the context of American women's history.



Historical Roots of Urban Crime (History 366; new History 279).
Mark Haller haller@vm.temple.edu
The course focuses on two aspects of the history of the underworld
of American cities: 1) The first aspect might be called the life within
the underworld, or what it means to live the life of a criminal. The course
examines how bookmakers or madams run their businesses, how pickpocket
gangs pick pockets, how loansharks collect their money, and what kind of
culture and social life characterizes those who are part of the underworld
life. 2) The second aspect is the way that underworld activities both reflect
and influence the wider society. The course, then, examines the interrelationships
of crime, on the one hand, and ethnic groups, neighborhood structure, urban
politics, criminal justice institutions, the rise of professional sports,
the changing sexual mores of the society, and even such aspects as the
changing role of the family and the impact of technology. Crime becomes
a prism through which students will learn about the history of American
urban society.



History of the American Presidency (new History 273).
James Hilty jwhilty77@aol.com
The History of the American Presidency examines historical developments
in the office of the US president from its establishment to contemporary
times. Through lectures, discussions, class projects, and outside assignments,
we will explore the historical literature dealing with the creation and
evolution of the office; the presidents who have shaped the office; the
powers and limitations of the office in both foreign and domestic affairs;
the president's relationship to the courts, the congress, the people, and
the press; and the broad political developments essential to our understanding
of the place of the presidency within our changing political culture. This
course asks: How has our most important national political institution
come to be what it is? Two themes permeate the course: (1) What is the
source and nature of presidential power? "Political power," Richard Neustadt
wrote in Presidential Power (1990 edition), "is the ability to persuade."
(2) Who are the men who have held the office and why have they failed or
succeeded? "Great men," noted the Englishman James Bryce in The American
Commonwealth (1906), "have not often been chosen Presidents, first
because great men are rare in politics; secondly, because the method of
choice may not bring them to the top; thirdly, because they are not, in
quiet times, absolutely needed." This course prepares students for further
historical or other academic studies and for related professional careers
in law, journalism, or executive management. More importantly, the course
engages students' concerns as life-long participants in American democracy.



History of American Science (History 136; new History 274)
Morris Vogel mjvogel@vm.temple.edu
This course approaches the history of science in America as a characteristically
modern way of thinking, investigating questions, and designing technology.
We will consider the development of the scientific approach to problem-solving
as a key factor in understanding major issues in American intellectual,
social, and political history. We will focus on three periods in American
history. In the first, from the founding of the British North American
colonies to the mid-nineteenth century, we will concentrate on the challenge
that early science posed to religious faith. In the second, from the mid-nineteenth
to mid-twentieth centuries, we will examine how science and technology
came to be central to modern society. In the third, the latter half of
the 20th century, we will analyze the competing claims of science,
politics and religion. We will pay attention in each period to the multiple
social contexts within which science happens. We will be especially concerned
with issues of wealth, gender, race and ethnicity; the family, schools
and universities as institutions of learning; and the uses of science and
technology for economic development, social welfare, and military and political
power.



Jewish Experience in America (History 229; new History 285).
Harriet Freidenreich hfreiden@thunder.ocis.temple.edu
The evolution of the Jewish community in the United States from its
colonial beginnings to the present day. Topics include the immigrant experiences
of various waves of migration, especially from Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union; the development of the major religious movements within Judaism:
Reform, Conservative, Orthodox and Reconstructionist; the role of Jews
in American life and politics; the changing roles of American Jewish women;
American antisemitism; Black-Jewish relations; relationship between American
Jews and Israel; assimilation and identity.



Jewish Experience in America (History 229; new History 285).
David Watt dwatt@nimbus.ocis.temple.edu
This course surveys the major developments in American Jewish life
from the Colonial period to the present. We will discuss the various waves
of Jewish immigration to the United States and examine the evolution of
Jewish social, political, religious, and cultural patterns in America.
Special attention will be paid to issues of ethnicity, acculturation, and
identity. We will also explore the relationship between Jews and American
culture, considering how Jews are represented and how they represent themselves
in a film.



Modern American Social History (History 222; new History 280).
Kenneth Kusmer
The purpose of this course is to provide an overview of the main elements
of American social/economic development during the industrial period, approximately
1870-1940. Topics covered include the growth.of new industries and changing
work conditions, urbanization, class divisions, immigration and black migration,
the changing status of women and the family, and the impact of the Great
Depression and the New Deal on American life. Both secondary and primary
sources--including two important novels with social history themes--are
used in the course, and students are required to write a essay (and give
an in-class report) that analyzes a specific primary source dealing with
one of the aspects of social history covered in the lectures and required
readings. The take-home final exam essay also requires that students evaluate
sources, Class participation in discussing the readings is also an important
part of the course.



Nineteenth-Century America (new History 270).
Herbert Ershkowitz ersh@astro.ocis.temple.edu
This is an advanced level history course aimed at giving history majors
and students in other disciplines such as English and Political Science
an understanding of the changes in American life during the Nineteenth
Century. This is truly a "World
We Have Lost," a society dominated
by agricultural, but becoming increasingly industrial and urbanized. But
even though a visit to the world of 100 years ago is as foreign to contemporary
students as the visit by the anthropologist to a non-western culture, the
consequence for modern American life is immense. The topics discussed in
this course are related to the changes in the United States that promoted
its development as a multicultural democracy and an economic superpower.



Race and the US Constitution (History R246; new History R267).
Howard Ohline holine@thunder.ocis.temple.edu
The central focus of History R267 is how the issue of race has shaped
the history of the United States Constitution and how
constitutional law contributed to the history of ideas about race in the United States. We
study the origins of the law of race and slavery in the pre-revolutionary
period and end with understanding the origins of affirmative action in
the post-World War II period. Students will read various books about U.
S. Constitutional history in order to understand various interpretations
of historical events and ideas abut race. Student will also read original
court cases about racial minorities in order to develop an understanding
of original historical texts. Many of the skills emphasized in the class
prepare students for law school, public service, and analysizing the historical
roots of contemporary issues. Class discussion about constitutional issues
is designed to give students confidence and precision in public speaking.
Students will also write book reviews in order to develop an understanding
of how historians collect evidence in order to construct historical interpretations
and to develop their own interpretations of historical events and their
personal writing skills.



Sexual Minorities in the US (History230; new History 288).
Dennis Rubini 
Sexual Minorities in the United States focuses upon lesbians,
gays, and other sexual minorities on their interaction in a hostile society.
The course starts with study of sexuality in general, with a European background,
and why it was something of a prohibited subject before Dr. Alfred Kinsey.
We examine Kinsey through the eyes of an associate, Wardell Pomeroy, and
then move on to case studies of black and white sexual minorities in their
search for space. The course then turns to the first publicly elected gay
martyr and the reactions following his assassination. The focus then shifts
to women of color, their special problems and interactions with the lesbian
and gay community. It also opens up our second major discussion of AIDS.



Superpower America (History 249; new History 291).
Richard Immerman
rimmerma@astro.ocis.temple.edu
The Versailles Treaty concluding World War I represented a tragic defeat
for Woodrow Wilson. He failed, abysmally, both to steer the United States
toward an irrevocable commitment to global engagement, and to establish
and institutionalize a new framework and set of norms for the international
order based on U.S. leadership. The attack on the United States by a foreign
aggressor in December 1941 and America's participation in an Allied
coalition
during the Second World War, however, confirmed the foresight of Wilson's
policies. Indeed, when the United States emerged from the rubble of World
War II as the world's leading economic and sole atomic power, Washington
policymakers seized on this "second chance" to wield this power for the
purpose of constructing the international environment that Wilson had prescribed:
a Wilsonian world. This effort has remained the cornerstone of U.S. foreign
policy ever since. This course traces the ebb and flow of that effort.
It will begin with the diplomacy of World War II and Franklin
Roosevelt's
vision of "Open Spheres" patrolled by "Four Policemen." With Roosevelt's
death and the War's abrupt and violent termination, the ideal of multilateral
cooperation rapidly gave way to bipolar competition: the Cold War. From
Truman to Johnson, the United States
waged the Cold War relentlessly, alternating
between strategies of "containment" and "liberation." The ever-increasing
reliance on nuclear weapons with ever-increasing megatonnage did not produce
Armageddon, as many feared. But it did produce stalemates in Korea, fiascoes
and crises in Cuba, and Quagmires in Vietnam. Nixon solution to the
nuclear
predicament was to count on Mutually Assured Destruction (M.A.D.) to
deter
war and promote stability. Reagan tried to escape the predicament by
imagining
"Star Wars." Then the sudden end to the Cold War caught everyone by surprise.
As attested to by George Bush's rhetorical "New World Order" and the
inchoate
efforts of Bill Clinton to "enlarge" global democracy and free
market economies,
a rudderless policymaking community in Washington knows of no one to whom
to turn other than--Woodrow Wilson. Overlaying this narrative history is
a number of interrelated themes the course will explore. These themes include:
the rise and fall of the United States as a creditor nation; the tension
between America's idealistic impulses and the perceived need to behave
"realistically" in a frequently hostile environment; the impact of domestic
(political, economic, cultural, ideological, and psychological) influences
on foreign policy; the emergence of bipolarism and Soviet-American antagonism;
the challenge to bipolarism posed by the Third World and regional disputes;
atomic diplomacy and the balance of terror; "existential deterrence" and
arms limitation; crisis management and avoidance; and, finally, the end
of the Cold War, the implosion of the former Soviet Union, and the implications
of the Russian empire's collapse for restructuring the global system, reordering
America's international priorities, and producing a national strategy that
succeeds "containment." In short, this course examines war, peace, stability,
and everything in between. The assigned readings reflect an array of interpretations
and approaches to the study of the history of U.S. foreign policy. Although
no "formal discussions" are scheduled, students will be provided the opportunity--and
encouraged--to discuss freely their responses to and questions about these
interpretations, those of the instructor, during every class. In additions,
at least once each student will be required to present a succinct oral
summary of the fundamental issues raised in the previous session, and time
will be allotted to examine and dissect the sundry distributed documents
and, especially, those reproduced in the Jensen volume. Consequently, notwithstanding
the relatively hefty readings for some weeks, each student will be expected
to complete all assignments with the care and thoroughness necessary
to formulate questions and participate actively in class discussions: challenging,
probing, even arguing.



Twentieth-Century America (new History 271).
David Jacobs djacobs@vm.temple.edu
This course analyzes American politics, society and culture in the
twentieth century. Among the topics to be analyzed are the changing role
of the presidency from McKinley to Clinton, progressivism, World War I,
the conflictive 1920's, the depression and the New Deal, World War II,
affluence in the 1950's, the cold war, anticommunism, racism, the civil
rights movement, the rebellious 1960's, the war in Vietnam, Nixon, the
Great Society, the women's movement
and gender issues, the conservative backlash, and the new diversity.



Women in US History (History 244; new History 287)
Staff
The principal theme of this course in women's history can be summed
up in this phrase: "Unity, Difference and Diversity: The Search for Sisterhood
and Beyond." Working with a textbook, a number of scholarly articles, and
documents that come from throughout American History, we will explore the
ways in which women have both been affected by, and helped to shape, this
nation's history. Our emphasis will be on how women of different socioeconomic
backgrounds, races, and ethnic groups have experienced colonization, American
expansion, sectionalism, the industrial revolution, urbanization, imnu'gration,
war, economic depression, cultural transformations and political change.
We will be looking not only at commonalities but also differences among
women as well as the conflicts between women and a society based on male
supremacy. We will be exploring how race, ethnicity, and class affect the
experience of gender.

Term Paper**  
**Strategy:**  
Pick one ancient Mediterranean city (during one century 5th B.C.E. to 5th
century C.E., either Hellenic, Hellenistic, or Roman times) and one European
city (during one century 12th-17th centuries, either medieval, Renaissance, or
early modern times). Consider a particular aspect of urban life, thought, or
art that allows you to make an interesting comparison. Consider how similar or
different was that aspect of life in Hellenic, Hellenistic, or Roman antiquity
and in medieval, Renaissance, or early modern times. You are welcome to focus
on the recorded viewpoints of two individuals from differing urban contexts.

  **Format:**  
Title page indicating topic in two historical cities. Introductory paragraph
suggests your thesis concerning similarities and differences and begins your
8-page thoughtful essay of contextual comparison. Next page is endnotes for
alternate interpretations as well as primary source evidence. Last page is
bibliography containing full citation of class books and library books you
used.

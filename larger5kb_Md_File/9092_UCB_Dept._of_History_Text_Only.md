**_NOTE: The Department of History does not accept any Advanced Placement
credit in lieu of any major requirements. However, L & S counts these units
toward graduation._ **

**THE HISTORY MAJOR**

Four lower division courses must be completed prior to admission to the major
-- one from each of the following four areas:

I. Western Civilization to 1400 (4A, 4B, 30A, UGIS 44A, 44B, or 55A, or an
appropriate section of History 39);

II. European History since the Renaissance (5, 15, 30B, 31, UGIS 44C, 44D, or
55B, or an appropriate section of History 39);

III. History of the United States (7A, 7B, 16, 17A, 17B, or an appropriate
section of History 39);

IV. Latin America, Asia, Africa (8A, 8B, 9A, 9B, 9C, 9D, 10, or an appropriate
section of History 39).

You may replace one of these lower division courses with an upper division
course in that same area.

Seven upper division courses must be completed for graduation from the
Department of History. The seven required courses are to be distributed as
follows:

1) Four upper division courses must be chosen from at least two of the
following fields of history: Ancient, Europe, Britain, United States, Latin
America, Asia, Africa, History of Science. Economics 111A-B, 113, or 115 may
also be included. Additional sections of istory 103 (beyond the requirement --
see below), one historiography course (History 190), and/or one 4-unit 199 may
be substituted for required upper division lecture courses.

2) Two proseminars (History 103) must be chosen from two separate fields as
listed in 1) above. For this requirement, sections of 103 in Europe pre- and
post-1600 may be counted as proseminars in two different fields. NOTE:
Previous preparation in a lecture course is usually assumed or required for
admission to 103 seminars.

3) One History 101 (Seminar in Historical Research and Writing for History
Majors) must be chosen from one of the two fields selected for 103. This
course may be taken in either the junior or senior year, and should not be
attempted in one's first semester at Berkeley. The 101 Student's Manual is
available for purchase at Copy Central (2560 Bancroft Way) or can be
downloaded as a PDF file
[here](http://history.berkeley.edu/101_student_manual.pdf). ****

**HONORS IN HISTORY**

The Department's Undergraduate Honors Program is intended for senior majors of
superior ability in history who have the necessary grade-point averages (at
least 3.5 in the major and 3.3 overall) and who would benefit from individual
work with a member of the faculty and discussion with students of similar
interests.

The Honors program requires two courses in addition to the major requirements
- History H195 or 285 and History H102 - as well as an oral examination.

**The Research Essay**

Honors students may take either one of two courses to write their Honors paper
-- History H195 or History 285. H195 is a one-semester, four unit course
consisting of the preparation of an honors research essay under the
supervision of a member of the Department who has consented to direct it;
History 285 is a one-semester, four unit graduate equivalent of History 101.
In some cases, the essay produced in H195 or 285 may be a development (but not
a revision) of the  
paper produced in History 101. It must demonstrate a first-rate historical
understanding and proficiency, as well as a sense of historical warrants and
evidence. History 101 is prerequisite to both courses.

The research and writing of this historical paper is possibly the best part of
the honors program. It is surely one of the most important. It provides the
student with the opportunity to undertake a historical inquiry into a subject
of his or her own choosing with the personal guidance of a faculty member who
has been doing just that sort of thing for quite a while, and who therefore
can be very helpful. A number of students have said that the experience of
producing the honors essay was the high point of their undergraduate career.
However, in this work the initiative rests primarily with the student; even
the guidance that the faculty member provides depends in large measure upon
the student's ability to ask for it. Students are encouraged to discuss their
choice of research essay with members of the Honors Committee and with their
faculty advisor.

While the faculty advisor will assign a grade for History H195 or History 285,
the Honors Committee will determine whether or not the essay produced is of
honors quality.

**Honors Colloquium**

History H102 is taught every semester. Students may enroll in H102, with the
consent of the instructor, at any point in their careers. Enrollment is
limited, however, and preference given to 1) students writing their research
essays, and 2) students who have completed History 101.

**The Oral Examination**

Honors candidates must take an oral examination at the end of the semester in
which they write their thesis.

> In addition to the Civil War, the Great Depression, and World War II, the
1960s arguably constitute one of the historical and cultural watersheds of
American history, and certainly have altered forever the course of American
history and culture. Using original and secondary sources, we will explore the
most turbulent decade of the twentieth century, examining the intersections of
the civil rights, women's, and gay rights movements; the Cold War; the space
race; the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations; and figures and forces
in popular culture, including television, popular film, and folk and rock-and-
roll music.

>

> We will take an interdisciplinary, American studies approach to the
material, drawing from history, culture studies, literary studies, political
science, and sociology to achieve a complex understanding of the sometimes
bewildering forces that constituted the 1960s. Along the way, we will examine
"meta-issues" involved in the American studies approach to culture, such as
historiographical debates regarding the "meaning" of the 1960s decade, its
precursors, and its legacy. For example, did the 1960s mark the end of a
constrained, culturally infertile, and undemocratic period that oppressed
women and minorities, or were the 1960s the beginning of the end of a formerly
great nation that understood its purpose and its place in the international
scene? Were they a time of liberation, or a time characterized by a consumer
culture that has sentenced future generations to the amoral purposelessness of
late capitalism?

>

> By the end of this course, you should be able to analyze, with detail and
complexity, the intersecting forces of the 1960s, and to apply the
interdisciplinary methods of American studies to such analyses. In other
words, you are developing, simultaneously, historical and cultural knowledge
and the skills to understand it. You also will hone your speaking and writing
abilities and your use of technology in the pursuit of understanding and the
communication of ideas.

>

> Students are encouraged to complete one upper-division course in American
literature, history, or film before taking this course. Liberal Studies
students should not register for this or any other 400-level course until they
have completed at least one core course.

> The final examination will be held from 8:45 to 10:50 a.m. on **Tuesday,
December 15**. Mark it on your calendar _now_ ; it cannot be made up if
missed.

>

> This schedule is subject to change. The most current schedule will always be
posted at _http://weber.u.washington.edu/~davidgs/Sixties.html_ for your
reference, and changes will be announced in class or on the _sixties_
electronic discussion list.

>

> Keep a copy of all submitted work. No extra credit or paper re-writes will
be permitted, but I will gladly assist you with your work. In-class exercises
cannot be made up for any reason because the group interaction is
irreproducible. Late assignments will be accepted only in extenuating
circumstances that could not have been anticipated, and only up to one week
late; penalties may apply. Keep all graded materials until you receive your
final course grade.

>

> In accordance with University policy, I give Incompletes only if you are
passing the course and attending class to within two weeks of the end of the
quarter, and then only in extenuating circumstances that can be proven.

>

> IMPORTANT: I insist on academic honesty. You are responsible for
understanding all aspects of University regulations regarding academic
honesty. Acts of academic dishonesty, including but not limited to
**cheating** (e.g., copying another person's work or obtaining examination
answers in a dishonest manner) and **plagiarism** (i.e., using another
person's words or ideas without acknowledgment) will result in a zero for the
assignment or examination; additional sanctions may be imposed by the
University administration. Note that American rules regarding plagiarism might
differ markedly from those in other countries. You can find more information
in the University Handbook and in the materials attached to this syllabus. I
will help you any way I can so you do not have to resort to dishonesty. I
truly want you to succeed. Visit my office hours often!

>

> If you do not already have an e-mail account (either a University account or
a private one), please obtain one by **October 6** and learn how to use it.
_This is a course requirement._ For information about obtaining a free
University e-mail account, call Computing and Communication at (206) 543-5970.
Using an electronic discussion list ( _sixties@u.washington.edu_ ) and the
World Wide Web will be integral parts of the course. You must subscribe to the
list by **October 8**. I urge you to subscribe early so that, if you encounter
difficulties, you can surmount them before the deadline. You alone are
responsible for subscribing successfully by the deadline.

>

> To subscribe to the sixties list, send an e-mail message to
_listproc@u.washington.edu_ , leaving the 'Subject' line blank. In the body of
the message, type

>

>> subscribe sixties Lastname, Firstname

>

> and send the message. (Note the format: last name with a capital first
letter, comma, space, and first name with a capital first letter.) If you
subscribed successfully, you will receive, in your regular e-mail, a welcome
message from the _sixties_ list. If you do not recieve the welcome message
within a few hours of sending your subscription request, you made a mistake
and should try again or notify the instructor. Forward to the instructor any
error messages that you receive. When subscribed, you will automatically
receive, in your personal e-mail, all messages posted by your classmates on
the _sixties_ list. You, too, can post messages simply by sending e-mail to
the list. (Instructions will be provided when you subscribe.) You are required
to check your e-mail at least once a week and to read everything posted to the
list.

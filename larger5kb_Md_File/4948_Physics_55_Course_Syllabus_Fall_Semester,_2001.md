###  Welcome:

Welcome to [ Physics 55 ](http://www.phy.duke.edu/Courses/055/), Duke
University's one-semester introduction to astronomy. You are fortunate to be
living during the greatest period of astronomical exploration and discovery in
the history of the human race, with many discoveries being reported weekly on
the front pages of national newspapers and magazines. These discoveries are
constantly challenging our perception of who we are as humans, what we know
about the world, and what will be the fate of society and of the universe.

During this semester, you will be exposed to many of the extraordinary facts
that have been discovered about the universe and about our relation to the
universe. You will learn some science so that you can understand how these
facts were discovered by invention, observation, and deduction. You will see
that scientists have conceived many remarkable ideas to explain the observed
facts. Using telescopes and observational data, you will have a chance to
appreciate first hand the richness of our universe and some of the mysteries
that remain.

###  Prerequisites:

  1. A curiosity and open mind to learn about the universe. 
  2. Some skepticism and a willingness to ask questions: how do people know what we know about astronomy? 
  3. A working knowledge of high-school mathematics 
    * The ability to manipulate numbers written in scientific notation, e.g., you should know how to multiply 1.2 ¡Á106 times the number -3.4 ¡Á10-3. 
    * The ability to manipulate and to understand simple algebraic expressions. 
    * The ability to plot and to appreciate graphs.  Appendix C of the textbook ("A Few Mathematical Skills") reviews most of what you need to know so please read this appendix if you feel your skills are rusty. The course will also give you numerous opportunities to review and to practice your mathematical skills. 

![](neutralr10.jpg)

###  Requirements:

You will need to have:

  1. The course textbook [ The Cosmic Perspective, Second Edition](http://www.awlonline.com/product/0,2627,0805380418,00.html) by Jeffrey Bennett et al. This can be purchased in the bookstore in the basement of the Bryan Center. 
  2. A small inexpensive calculator that can handle scientific notation (which appears in the form 1.2E6 or -3.4E-3 on a calculator). Such calculators can be purchased for about $10 at many stores. (A graphing calculator like a TI-83 is fine but overkill for this course.) **Please bring your calculator with you to each lecture** since the class will often break up into small groups to solve problems related to the lecture. 
  3. A bound, college-lined, 8.5" ¡Á11" notebook with at least 80 pages that will serve as your science journal for the semester. You will hand this in every few weeks and at the end of the semester for part of your overall grade. 
  4. A computer with color display screen, CD-ROM, and a connection to the Internet. You will be installing and using a digital planetarium program [ SkyGazer ](http://www.carinasoft.com/skygazer.html) that comes free with your textbook. 
  5. A Duke [computer account](http://www.oit.duke.edu/access/getacpub.html) for browsing the Internet and for e-mail. Your browser should be configured to display PDF (Portable Document Format) and QuickTime files. (The [OIT](http://www.oit.duke.edu) web page has links that explain how to do this.) 
  
Each week, **you will need to commit about 10  hours of time for reading and
for homework**.

  1. You should plan on about **2  hours of reading for each lecture for a total of about 6 hours of reading per week**. Astronomy, like many sciences, is a technical subject that involves many new and challenging concepts. Most students will require several passes through the text to understand what is being said. Further, later material builds on earlier material so that you need to keep up with the weekly reading so that you do not fall behind.   
Note: You are expected to read and to think about the assigned material before
lecture and to come prepared to ask questions and to discuss the material in
class.  
Also, please appreciate that the lectures will have time only to address the
key ideas. The weekly reading will be absolutely essential for you to learn
the necessary details.

  2. You should plan on spending **2-4  hours on the weekly homework assignment**. The amount of time will vary from week to week and will depend on the types of problems and projects. 
  3. You should plan on spending **1/2 to one hour per week, writing in your scientific journal**. 
  
Finally, **I expect you to be courteous and ethical throughout the semester**
, in class, during exams, and when completing homework assignments.

  1. In class, I expect you to be courteous: 
    1. You should show up to class on time. 
    2. You should be attentive (stay awake!). 
    3. You should avoid disruptions to the class. Please do not leave class early, do not read newspapers during class, do not bring portable radios or players for CDs or MP3 files, or portable computers with a wireless link for surfing during lecture. Please do not make a lot of noise as the class comes to an end. 
    4. Please be respectful to your fellow students. 
    5. If you must be late or leave early, please tell me beforehand.  Students who do not practice common courtesy should expect their final grade to be reduced substantially. 

  2. **Do not cheat** on quizzes, exams, or homework assignments. Duke University has an [ Undergraduate Academic Honor Code](http://www.duke.edu/web/honorcouncil/) that you should read and think about carefully several times before and during the semester. The penalties for cheating can be severe, including expulsion for a semester, for an academic year, or entirely from Duke. This course will use several ways to prevent and to detect cheating, including careful proctoring during the exam and the handing out of different versions of the same exam. 

If you are feeling a need to cheat, please first take a constructive step by
trying to talk with any of the many people on Duke campus who will be glad to
meet with you and try to find ways for you to avoid yielding to this pressure.
These people include myself, the Teaching Assistant for the course, the
Director of Undergraduate Studies in Physics, faculty from your other courses,
fellow students, and various counselors on campus.

###  Grading

Your final grade for the course will be based on your scientific journal, on
occasional quizzes, on weekly homework assignments, on the examinations, and
on discussions that you contribute to inside and outside of class. The
contributions to your final grade are as follows:

**Activity** |  **Percent of Total Grade**  
---|---  
Scientific journal  |  10%  
Quizzes  |  20%  
Homework assignments  |  20%  
Midterm exam  |  20%  
Final exam  |  30%  
We discuss these in turn.

  1. **Scientific Journal** :   
**Each week, you should write at least one full page in your scientific
journal. Each entry in your journal should be dated with the day of entry.**
What you write is completely open ended so follow your own interests. The only
requirement is that what you think and write about pertains to the theme of
astronomy (this is pretty broad!). Entries could include:

    * Your own questions and speculations. Write down and discuss an astronomical or scientific question that you find interesting, no matter how silly or strange. Questions can be triggered by pictures, by discussions with classmates or with roommates, by news on the television or Internet, or by looking at the sky or at the world around you. Follow your instincts about what seems to be interesting. 

    * Your thoughts on a newspaper article, a magazine article, some web page, some nonfiction or fiction book, some television show, or some movie pertaining to astronomy. (Please give a complete reference in your journal if you discuss an item like this.) For example, you may see an article about the possibility of a meteor strike causing the extinction of human life, the mystery of missing neutrinos from the sun, the discovery of planets around remote stars, a local newspaper article about an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO), a book review about science coming to an end, your feelings about the movie "Contact" with Jodie Foster, your comments about the classic science fiction novel "Return From the Stars" by Stanislaw Lem, the discovery of huge black holes in the centers of galaxies, new speculations on the origin of life, the craziness of string theory with its prediction of a 10-dimensional universe, your thoughts about some Star Trek episode, a report about a new technology for travel to the stars, the latest report on gravity wave detectors and what kinds of insights such detectors may bring, advances in biology that may allow suspended animation and so travel to the stars, economic or political decisions affecting research in astronomy and related sciences, or some recent panel discussion of theologians and scientists trying to reconcile our experimental understanding of cosmology with religious works like the Bible. 

    * Your thoughts about the course and its pedagogy, including lectures, assignments, and reading. Was there a topic that was not clear? If so, why not? Was there a topic that grabbed your interest and that you wanted to hear more? Were there topics that were not mentioned at all that should have been discussed? Was there a topic that contradicted what you understand or believe? Should different kinds of homework problems be assigned? Can you think of an example or demonstration that would improve upon the book or lecture? If so, use your journal to make specific comments and recommendations. 

    * Make your own scientific observations and keep informal sketches and writings of your observations in your journal. Draw regular pictures of the moon, of Venus, of Mars, of the Sun, or of some constellation and make comments about when and where you made the observation and if anything caught your interest. Draw and think about the patterns of stars in the sky, about their colors, and of their brightnesses. Are there any differences between observing the night sky with both eyes open or with just one eye? Is there a pattern to how stars twinkle, say depending on their position in the sky or the time of night or on the brightness or color of the star? Can you detect and plot retrograde motion of some planet over the semester? Can you draw or describe accurately how the colors of the sky change during sunrise or sunset? Use your polarized sunglasses to see if sunlight or starlight is polarized, look at the stars or at various light sources on and off campus with an inexpensive diffraction grating and draw pictures of the spectral lines that you observe. Attend a local amateur astronomy meeting and summarize your experience.  There are no right or wrong answers for your journal. You will get full credit if you make a weekly effort and demonstrate creative and active thinking through your weekly writing. 

  2. **Quizzes:**   
About once every two weeks, there will be an in-class 15 minute quiz
consisting of several questions. These quizzes will test your basic knowledge
and conceptual understanding about points recently discussed in lecture. They
should help you to keep up with the material.

  3. **Homework assignments:**
    * There will be a homework assignment, roughly once per week, and typically due one week after being handed out. 

    * Because of the difficulty of grading all the problems with care in such a large class, **only some homework problems will be graded for each assignment**. You will not know in advance which problems are the ones to be graded so you should do your best on each problem.   
Although some problems will not be graded, you will still benefit
substantially by doing them:

      * You will learn the material more thoroughly. 
      * Some of the quiz and exam problems will be drawn from the homework problems that were not graded. 

    * **Late homeworks are not accepted!** If you think you will not be able to hand in your homework by its due date, please get in touch with me as soon as possible (at least three days before the due date) and explain what the situation is. 

    * You are allowed to collaborate with your classmates on an assignment. (This is realistic, scientists collaborate all the time in research!) **However: you must write up your homework on your own, in your own words, and with your own understanding. You must also acknowledge explicitly at the beginning of your homework anyone who gave you substantial help, e.g., classmates or the TA or myself.** (Again, scientists usually acknowledge in their published articles colleagues that helped in completing some particular research.) Failure to write your homeworks in your own words and failure to acknowledge help when given may lead to severe academic penalties so please play by the rules. 

    * Your homework assignments should be of collegiate quality. For questions that require a written answer, please be clear and demonstrate insight. Writing clearly means using a word processor or using readable handwriting (no tiny or crowded script). You should use proper grammar, correct spelling, and good sentence and paragraph structure. For questions that require a mathematical answer, show your work clearly. Use plenty of space between symbols and use blank lines to separate successive lines of equations. You will get partial or no credit if the TA or myself can not _easily_ read your answer.   
Demonstrating insight means using complete sentences that explain what you are
doing and why. Cryptic brief answers like "yes", "no", or "24"" will not be
given credit. Your written answers must show that you understand how you got
your answer and that you appreciate the significance of your answer. A simple
criterion for a well-written complete answer is that you will be able to
understand the answer yourself several weeks after you have written your
answer, even without remembering what the original question was. Writing
clearly especially pays off when it comes time for you to review your
assignments in preparation for the midterm and final examinations. Learning to
write clearly is also one of the most valuable skills you can learn at Duke,
one that will pay off many times over as you seek jobs after graduation.

    * While writing your homework assignments, please pay attention to details. All symbols should be given names the first time you introduce them. For example, you should say "the distance  d" or "the angle a" instead of just using the symbols d and a. Physical units should be given for any answer that is a physical quantity. For example, you should say "the distance was d=0.02 km", "the angle was a=32 degrees", or "the temperature was T=6000 K". Graphs should be carefully drawn and have their axes clearly labeled by symbol and units. Each graph should have a title explaining what is being plotted.   
Numbers obtained from a calculator should be rounded to two significant digits
unless otherwise requested. Thus if you obtain an answer 1.23456789E-03 for
some problem, you should write this down in your assignment as 1.2¡Á10-3 (i.e.,
hold onto the first two nonzero digits when the number is written in
scientific notation.) Two significant digits are fine for most problems in
astronomy, especially for an introductory course.

  4. **Exams:** The grades for the midterm and final exam will be scaled. Questions will consist of a mixture of multiple choice and open questions, some of them adapted from quizzes and homework assignments. All relevant equations and data will be provided with the exams so you will not need to memorize such information. Instead, your goal during the exam will be to show that you can think conceptually and scientifically.

###  Time and Place

Classes will meet Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 11:50 am to 12:40 pm in
Physics 114\. **The lectures will begin promptly at 11:50  am so please come
on time.**

Physics 114 is a large classroom so please sit as close as possible to the
front of the room. This will help you to be actively involved during the
lecture and also give you a better chance to see the various demonstrations.

There will be occasional supplementary classes, e.g., observational classes to
examine the sky with telescopes and with binoculars, and review meetings to
prepare for exams, to ask questions related to the homework, or to strengthen
your math background. These will be announced on the course web page and by
e-mail.

![](neutralr10.jpg)

###  Office Hours

My office hours are Thursday morning from 9:30-10:30am and Friday morning from
9:30-10:30am, in Room 047 of the Physics Building.

If you can not make these times or wish to meet in addition to these times,
please call me at my office (660-2548) or send me e-mail (hsg@phy.duke.edu)
and request an appointment. I will do my best to meet with you as soon as
possible after your request.

I am often logged into the Duke computer network during evenings and weekends.
If you have a question short enough to answer via e-mail, please e-mail me a
message and I will try to respond quickly. Please feel free to ask me about
any aspects of the course: topics discussed in lecture or in the text, the
current homework assignment, a recent quiz, or some interesting article that
you recently saw that might be fun to share with the class.  
  
If you are in the Physics building, please drop by my office (Physics 047),
introduce yourself, and say hi. I would greatly enjoy the chance to meet with
you outside of class.

###  Course Schedule

The following is the _approximate_ weekly schedule for reading, quizzes, and
exams. Further details about what to read each week will be available in the
homework assignments, available via the link [homeworks](homeworks). The
supplementary observational meetings and trips to local observatories will be
posted on the course web page and e-mailed to the class.  
  
A 14-week semester consisting of about 40  lecture hours is not long enough to
cover the entire book, at least substantively. As a compromise, this course
will emphasize the chapters on stars, galaxies, and cosmology since these
involve some of the most challenging and interesting scientific ideas and
issues, e.g., how the heavier atoms are created by stellar fusion, the
formation and properties of black holes, and the expansion and evolution of
the universe. We will touch upon chapters related to observation and the solar
system mainly during our evening observation times.

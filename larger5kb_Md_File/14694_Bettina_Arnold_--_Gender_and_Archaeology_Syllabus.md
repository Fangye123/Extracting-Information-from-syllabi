**COURSE DESCRIPTION** : This course is an introduction to developments in
anthropological and archaeological research on women and gender over the past
two decades. We will examine the issue of engendering archaeology from an
anthropological, historical, political and methodological perspective. How do
we recognize gender archaeologically? What are the benefits, as well as the
limitations, of an "engendered" approach to the study of prehistoric
societies? The course will focus on the interdisciplinary implications of such
questions in archaeology with a more general examination of anthropological
theories regarding sex and gender roles.  
  
**READINGS** : There are two primary textbooks for this course:  
  
Gero, J.M. and M. Conkey (eds) 1991 _Engendering Archaeology: Women and
Prehistory_. New York: Basil Blackwell.  
  
Nelson, Sarah Milledge 1997 _Gender in Archaeology_. London: Altamira Press.  
  
Additional readings will be available in the Anthropology Reading Room in
Bolton Hall.

**EVALUATION AND GRADING** :  

  1. **Two** short papers ( **5 pages minimum** ): 40% of the course grade. Choose two of the weekly topics, and provide an opinion piece on that topic. See attached guide to preparing short papers. **Important** : Papers are always due on the class following the topic week. **Penalty for late papers:** One full point per day. Each paper is worth 20% of your final grade, so one full point is 1% of the final grade. This adds up, so stay on schedule! 

  2. **Final paper** ( **15 pages minimum** ): 37% of the course grade. Choose one of the short paper topics and expand it, or you may choose a different course topic for the final paper. Be sure to include any references not assigned as class reading in your bibliography. 

  3. **Weekly Summaries of Readings** : 13% of the course grade. Students will choose **three** articles from the additional readings each week and will hand in 1 paragraph (single spaced) summaries for each article. Summaries are due each Tuesday for that week's readings, beginning with Sept. 8. See attached guidelines for preparing summaries. 

  4. **Group Work** : 10% of the course grade. Beginning with Week 4, every two weeks (even numbered weeks), a group of three students will come to class with a set of **5** discussion questions addressing the key points covered by the reserve reading for that two week topic. The Group Questions should be signed by all participants and handed in at the end of class. See attached guidelines for Group Work.

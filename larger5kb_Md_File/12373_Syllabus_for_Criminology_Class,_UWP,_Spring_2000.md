!! **WARNING** : THIS IS **_NOT_ ** YOUR TRADITIONAL COURSE WHERE THE
PROFESSOR LECTURES WHILE STUDENTS QUIETLY TAKE NOTES. THIS PROFESSOR USES A
COOPERATIVE LEARNING APPROACH AS WELL AS SEVERAL EXPERIMENTAL AND INNOVATIVE
TEACHING/LEARNING TECHNIQUES. GROUPWORK IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT IN THIS
COURSE!  
  
_ASSIGNMENTS_ :  
  
_Attendance_ Your active participation -- attendance, current events, class
discussions and other course related activities -- is an important element in
this course.  
  
_Concept Exercises_ \-- A series of exercises, with accompanying lecture notes
designed to clarify what we were thinking of when we asked the question, must
be answered by e-mail. The lecture notes will apprise you of at least one
plausible way to answer the question, and you should reflect in your answer
that you recognize our response, though you are welcome to disagree with it.
Answers to concept exercises shall be kept to **no more than 25 words**. You
shall recognize any author whose work you quote with quotation marks; and some
of your answer must be rephrased into your own words.You are required to
submit **_15_** concept exercises, your choice of which concepts, but the
concepts must cover a range taken from the beginning, middle, and end of the
semester. The final deadline for each concept exercise is one week (7 days)
after the exercise was assigned. The concept exercises constitute 80% of the
course grade.  
  
_Debriefing_ of an Actual Sociological Experience with the Law -- For the
actual experience, you may wish to visit a court, go on a police ride-along,
interview someone with an experience to share, visit a "battered women's"
shelter, visit a local school and talk to young people about their experience
with the law, or any of a variety of other activities. You are required to
submit one debriefing of a shared experience. Please keep your analysis brief,
and be sure to link it to theory, to policy, to course discussions. A form for
the debriefing that you may use as guide will be available on the "Dear
Habermas" web site. Prior to the actual experience, pre-approval is required.
Your debriefing assignment will have a written component which is **due 11
a.m. April 28th** via e-mail, and an oral component to be presented during the
final week of class. This assignment is 20% of the course grade.  
  
  
_GRADING_ \-- Successful and timely submission of **15** concept exercises
will earn a basic C for the course. For a B or an A, your discussion and
debriefing submissions must show scholarly discipline in conceptually linking
your material to theory, policy, practice, and to course discussions, with
appropriate citations to academic sources, should show some creative thought
on the issue. The overall grading criteria is based on the 4C's - consistency,
competency, creativity, and cooperation, (refer to the "Dear Habermas" web
site for more details).  
  
  
_IMPORTANT NOTES_ :  
  
_Students with Disabilities_ \- Students with disabilities are encouraged to
meet with me as soon as possible to discuss accommodations. Accommodations
should be authorized through the Disability Services Office, WYLL D175, Renee'
Sartin-Kirby - Coordinator (595-2610).  
  
_Deadlines/Due Dates_ \- All due dates and deadlines are firm. Late
assignments and exercises will **_not_** be accepted. A "no show" will result
in an "F" for that particular task.  
  
_Communicating_ \- It is _your_ responsibility to communicate an _emergency_
and other situations in a timely manner to the professor. Communicating your
whereabouts is important. Don't be a field mouse.  
  
_Groupwork_ : You may work in groups on any or all exercises or assignments.
Cooperative learning groups are strongly encouraged. You can work with more
than one group, and with different groups. All names of active group members
should be recorded as indicated on the exercise material.

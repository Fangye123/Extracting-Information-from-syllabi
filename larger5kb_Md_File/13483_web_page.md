> > > **COURSE  DESCRIPTION**

>>>

>>> This team-taught course examines medieval Europe from the transformation
of the Roman world to the beginning of a new global system. It offers an
interdisciplinary examination of major themes in medieval society and culture
with emphasis on literature, the arts, and the historical forces at work.
Topics will include the Roman heritage of the Middle Ages, pre/non-Christian
culture, the so-called Adark ages,@ Romanesque and Gothic worlds, crusades and
pilgrimages, commerce and cathedrals, and late medieval problems.
Prerequisites: Completion of the G.E. Foundation, one or more Explorations
courses, and upper-division standing. (Same course: C/LT 414I and HIST 414I).

>>>

>>> **This upper division General Education Capstone entails a significant
amount of reading an d writing**. While interactive lectures establish context
and introduce historical themes, much of our time will be devoted to engaged
discussions of contemporary sources. Emphasis will be on the critical reading
of primary sources (in translation) and their analysis through writing (formal
essays and informal written responses). Specifically, in class discussion, an
on-line discussion board, and most importantly in essays and exams, students
will be asked to analyze and explain the social, economic, political,
cultural, and religious forces that shaped the evolution of medieval
civilization and are reflected in its material culture. Attendance and
informed participation in discussion are expected.

>>>

cultural, and religious forces that shaped the evolution of medieval
civilization and are reflected in its material culture

the culture and society which produced them through both discussion and
written analysis.

>>>

hagiography, art, music, and other sources to analyze medieval culture and
society.

>>>

>>> _Accommodation:_ If you have a need for accommodation due to disability,
please notify one of us as soon as possible , but no later than two weeks from
the date the course begins.

>>>

>>> _Attendance and participation_ : This course emphasizes in-class
discussion and analysis of medieval texts.Therefore, prompt and regular
attendance is necessary. Always bring the texts to class. Moreover, simply
being present and breathing is insufficient. Students are expected to
participate in a lively, informed, and constructive manner. More than 4
unexcused absences will be penalized by a subtraction of 2 points for each
unexcused absence from the participation grade. Excused absences must be
documented; for example, a doctor's note, AAA or police report for car
problems, or a notice from the Athletic Director presented before the class to
be missed, etc. Religious observances are excused absences. If you must miss
class, see one of us in advance to arrange for make-up work. Turn off all cell
phones and pagers during class.

> > > _On-line Discussion Forum_. Students also are expected to take part in
an on-line discussion board (BeachBoard); a rubric explaining how this aspect
of your participation grade will be evaluated is posted on the class web page.
You should get in the habit of monitoring the discussion board. Specific
topics are indicated on the syllabus, but you should feel free to visit at any
time, respond to any post, or post your own question for discussion. Remember
that your posting will be read by the entire class and that basic rule of
courtesy apply. It is inappropriate to call someone names, be overtly rude, or
are blatantly sarcastic or condescending.

>>>

>>> _Papers_. Grading of all formal written work is based on the rubric which
is included in your course packet. We will discuss this rubric in class as
well. All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the day assigned.
Grades will go down five points for each calendar d ay that they are late
unless an extension has been granted in advance. Extensions are granted for
reasonable and documented requests. All work must be typed, double-spaced,
with one-inch margins and 12 point font.

> > > _Plagiarism_. PLAGIARISM WILL NOT BE TOLERATED. If a paper or any other
assignment is found to be plagiarized, the minimum penalty will be an F on the
assignment and the maximum will be an F in the course. If I suspect all or
part of an assignment may be plagiarized (that is, it is not clearly your own
intellectual work), I will ask to see your notes or drafts. I also may require
electronic submission of the paper to facilitate running the paper through the
databases at Turnitin.com. If you have any questions about plagiarism, please
talk with me. I also recommend the Purdue University On-line Writing Lab =s

> > > _Technology._ This class expects you to make significant use of the
Internet. E-mail will help facilitate communication with the instructor and
classmates, as well as to do real historical research on the World Wide Web.

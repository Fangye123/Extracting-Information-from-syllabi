>  **Course Description:**  
>  
>  The Idaho FLES program is designed to prepare prospective teachers to
become leaders in their schools in the teaching of **content-based foreign
language**. The program provides classroom teaching and observational
experiences for preservice teachers. Each preservice teacher is teamed with a
native speaker to facilitate the planning of lessons and teaching. In addition
to interacting with children in the Spanish language, the preservice teachers
focus on four different content areas of teaching: (1) science; (2)
mathematics; (3) social studies; and (4) technology. Teaching strategies are
discussed by combining current research with valuable field experiences on
which to base relevant/meaningful questions during the methods course. ([
**Links**](contentlinks.html) to content-based teaching information.)
Preservice teachers create original lesson plans and complete a reflective
assignment that provides closure for the day's activities at the conclusion of
each teaching session. The following week, they discuss their ideas and
concerns with the course instructor and other university FLES students.
Students also review at least three different textbook series during the
semester and discuss the effectiveness of the different presentation features
in class.  
>  It is hoped that the Idaho FLES program provides preservice teachers with
valuable experiences that carry through to all aspects of their teacher
preparation. Students teaching Spanish will be placed at McDonald Elementary
School. Students teaching other languages will be placed at St. Mary's
Catholic School.  
>  The Idaho FLES program provides students with the required methods course
needed to complete the requirements for a K-8 foreign language teaching
endorsement when they have a major or minor in foreign language. It also
provides secondary foreign language students the opportunity to expand their
6-12 foreign language teaching endorsement to K-12. An opportunity for
students to be trained in the protocols of the International GLOBE program
will also be provided during the first four weeks of the course (an optional 1
credit is available for workshop participants).  
>  
>  **Field Experience Timeline:**  
>  
>  We typically meet at the university for the first 4 weeks of the course.
During this time, we discuss pedagogy and specific readings as outlined on the
course calender. We will also meet at the university whenever the schedule at
the elementary school provides a day off for conferences or teacher inservice
days.  
>  
>  Every preservice teacher will teach in their own classroom at the
elementary school for a minimum of 31 days. We will visit the school the
during week four to tour the building, meet your mentor teacher and provide
you with the opportunity to observe your future students and mentor teacher in
action. You will be provided with a class roster before that date.

> **Course Objectives:**  
>  
>  1\. Discuss and analyze the differences between different early foreign
language program models.  
>  2\. Analyze current instructional techniques for teaching foreign language
to elementary students.  
>  3\. Apply the principals of immersion-based instruction toward the
development of literacy activities and content-based foreign language lessons
(lesson plan design).  
>  4\. Complete field experience in the assigned elementary school: 30
minutes/3Xweek (approximately 12 weeks in the field).  
>  5\. Review three different foreign language text book series to gain
awareness of current trends in foreign language teaching.  
>  6\. Become a **GLOBE Certified Teacher** in order to provide the basic
framework necessary for successful content-based foreign language teaching.

> Required Readings:**  
>  
>  The readings are connected on-line. Click on the calender for each week of
the course and the readings are listed on each page. Read each article and
print out those you want to save!  
>  
>  **Methods:**  
>  
>  We will be discussing and reading about the different approaches to
teaching foreign languages during our methods class meetings. An immersion-
based teaching model will be used in the elementary classroom where preservice
teachers are assigned. Preservice teachers are provided with 3 opportunities
to work with a class during the week, for only a 30 minute period each day.
Therefore, it is essential that the students hear and speak Spanish as much as
possible. The Idaho FLES program goals are to use the Spanish language in the
classroom for 95% of the 30 minute periods. It will appear difficult at first
but as soon as the students adjust their listening ear and participate in
class they won't want their Spanish teachers to speak English!! (Try not to
speak English whenever you can help it and always use Spanish when praising
students and during command sequences.)  
>  
>  **Helpful hint:** Language is learned best through social interaction. Try
not to just practice vocabulary words and drill, drill, drill......use visuals
with pictures of the vocabulary, sing songs to learn words or play games to do
this same thing. Learning a second language should be fun, not a passive
subject. It is very effective when the students move through a fast paced
30-minute lesson doing many different things. For example, teach new words by
showing pictures and saying or talking about the picture in Spanish. Then play
a quick game that utilizes the same set of words--drill the word set in this
fashion. Next you could allow students to work in groups to circle the words
that they just learned on a piece of paper or on the dry erase boards. Then
pull the students back together to sing a song related to the words. Drill
again if necessary. (Every classroom has individual chalk boards/dry erase
boards for the students. These are great teaching tools if you end up with
extra time and need a filler. Students can play pictionary, practice math
facts, practice writing in Spanish, etc.) The above described lesson would
move quickly from activity to activity and the students don't have time to
become bored.--they are actively involved in learning which is our goal!!
**Also, make sure to always model proper Spanish spelling--use accents--refer
to the**[ **accent mark guide**](accents.html) **for word programs.**  
>  
>  **Collaboration** :  
>  
>  Each preservice teacher is assigned to work with a native speaker who will
facilitate teaching Spanish in the school. It is imperative that regular
meeting times are established before each lesson in order to plan each lesson
and strategy for the day. It is very difficult to teach along side another
person (as a team) if there has been no prior preparation, discussion or plan
of attack established before entering the classroom. Again, organization and
preparation are essential! The native speakers serve two roles: (1) assistance
in translation and review of lesson materials; and (2) assistance in the
presentation of each lesson and modeling proper pronunciation. As a group,
they will take the role of a translation team and create additional materials
for use in the Idaho FLES program. Note: They typically do not have any means
of transportation and therefore you will need to coordinate your trips to the
elementary school.  
>  
>  **On-line Course Requirements:** **** Students will follow the same
requirements for the course according to this syllabus and the schedule
detailed in the calender above **plus** :  
>  1) Complete a 1-page summary statement regarding each reading (placed in
the final teaching portfolio). 2) Complete the text-book review (placed in the
final teaching portfolio).  
>  3) Arrange for a field placement in a local elementary school.  
>  4) E-mail the instructor once a week to report/discuss teaching assignment
(in lieu of the weekly meeting!).  
>  5) Send final portfolio to instructor by the pre-arranged date (end of
course). This portfolio will remain in the University of Idaho Instructional
Media Center for reference to other Foreign Language teachers.

>  Graduate Students Only:  
>  After consultation with the professor, undertake an investigation of a
topic of your choice that deals with foreign language education or second
language acquisition. The final written documentation should be 5 to 7 pages,
double spaced, APA style. Using the WWW, ERIC and other resources in the
library, prepare a bibliography of at least eight sources. This should be a
term project in which you work closely with the professor and your colleagues
in order to develop a comprehensive review of literature. Submit a draft
prepared on a word processor for my editorial comments by April 5th. Revise
your draft. The final paper is due the week before finals at which time you
will present your research to the class.

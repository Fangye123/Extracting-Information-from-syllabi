**_Description_ : **As the saying goes, Latin America lies too far from God
and too close to the United States. This proximity has affected Latin American
economics, demographics, culture, and politics. The seminar will begin with an
overview of US-Latin American relations from the Monroe Doctrine to the Bay of
Pigs. We will then concentrate on the twentieth century. Students will then
write a research paper using primary documents available here at Grinnell.
These papers could focus on any one of a number of issues that were central to
US-Latin American relations.

In addition to common readings, students will be asked to complete some short
written assignments that are designed to help them complete their term
paper.(See Assignments) Class participation is an integral part of the course,
so attendance is mandatory.

**_Readings_** should be completed prior to the class meeting for which they
are listed. The Syllabus below specifies the reading for each week. To see
reading for a specific week, choose:  Which Week? Week 1: August 26 Week 2:
September 6 Week 3: September 13 Week 4: September 20 Week 5: September 27
Week 6: October 4 Week 7: October 11 Week 8: October 25 Week 9: November 1
Week 10: November 8 Week 11: November 15 Week 12: November 22 Week 13:

Please note that most of the readings are available for purchase. Many are
also on [reserve](USLAres.html). When you do the reading, keep in mind the
question posed in the syllabus (see below). For purposes of discussion, be
prepared to define (1) the authors main point, (2) the type of evidence used
to make that point, (3) your assessment of whether the evidence and argument
convincingly sustain the conclusions, and (4) the relationship to other works
we have read.

**_Assignments_ : **For each class meeting, you will be expected to have done
the assigned reading and to be prepared to discuss it.

Over the course of the semester you will also be asked to complete four short
assignments. [One ](MicrAsgn.html)will be done for class on August 29, [the
second](FRUSAsgn.html) will be due September 26, [the third](BiblAsgn.html)
will be due October 12, and [the last](ArguAsgn.html) will be due November 16.
Keep these latter dates in mind as the semester proceeds. You will need to
begin work on the third and fourth assignments well ahead of time. Do Not Let
the Due Date Surprise You. These assignments are designed to help you choose a
research topic and turn that topic into a research project. This research
project will form the basis of the Research Term Paper that makes up the bulk
of your grade. It is due December 8 at noon.

When you prepare the papers you might want to consult the [Guide to Writing a
College Paper](http://www-college.uchicago.edu/writing-
program/resources/writing_in_college/index.htm) from the University of Chicago
Writing Program. Those documents will give you a sense of my expectations in
terms of writing. I am preparing a couple of pages that might help you revise
your papers to meet my expectations. I strongly advise you to check them out
once they are ready.

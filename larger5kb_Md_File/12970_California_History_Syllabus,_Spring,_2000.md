COURSE DESCRIPTION:

> > > > > This course surveys California history from its Native American
beginnings to the 1990s. It focuses on important aspects of the state's
history such as the exploitation of its rich natural resources, and the social
conflicts and complexities arising from its ethnic diversity, but it also
seeks to explore how these and other aspects of the state's history create a
cultural experience that gives the designation "California" a world-wide
resonance.

the topic thoughtfully selected? Is the writing clear and to the point? Does
the introduction put forward a strong interpretative focus which is then used
to structure the paper? Paper 1: Does the paper accurately address the
twentieth century impact of the development it discusses? Paper 2: Does the
paper accurately summarize the historical roots of the contemporary
circumstances it describes?

The purpose of History 441 is to introduce the advanced student to the most
significant events and personalities, trends and issues associated with the
historical evolution of the modern nations of Latin America, from the winning
of political independence from Spain and Portugal in the early nineteenth
century to the struggles of our own times. Although material presented in the
course contributes to an understanding of the entire region, we will emphasize
the individual histories of Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, and Mexico. The principal
question addressed is: what are the historical roots of the region's
characteristic problems of political instability and disorder, extremely
unequal distribution of wealth, and external domination, and how have these
four societies in particular sought to overcome them?

**THIS SYLLABUS IS PROVIDED FOR YOUR INFORMATION AND GUIDANCE. YOU ARE
RESPONSIBLE FOR ITS CONTENTS. PLEASE KEEP IT WITH YOUR CLASS NOTES AND BRING
IT WITH YOU TO CLASS AND TO CONFERENCES WITH THE INSTRUCTOR.**

**E-MAIL AND THE INTERNET.**   By **Tues., June 6, 2000,** each student in
History 441-030 must provide me with a valid, active e-mail address.   As an
enrolled student at Louisiana Tech University you are entitled to free
networked computer access.  If you do not have Internet access on your own and
have not already opened your student Internet account at Louisiana Tech,
please do this without delay.  This is done at the Computing Center in the
basement of Wyly Tower and it requires a valid student identification card.
In History 441-030 I will make  use of e-mail to communicate with you between
class meetings, and I expect that you will use it to communicate with me as
well.  Also, you will need reliable access to the World Wide Web, because the
syllabus and other necessary documents for History 441-030 will not be
distributed in hard copy.

**RESPONSE PAPERS.   **There will be three response papers due, as follows:  
  **DATE DUE** |  **TOPIC  ** |  **WEIGHT**  
---|---|---  
**Mon., June 12, 2000** |  **Sarmiento** |  _40 pts_.  
**Thurs., June 22, 2000** |  **Beezley** |  _40 pts._  
**Thurs., July 6, 2000** |  **O'Connor**   |  _40 pts._  


Response papers will be brief (3-5 pp.) critical responses to the readings.
They will be necessary preparation for discussions scheduled for each of the
readings.  Responses must _not_ be summaries of the material, but rather
attempts to engage with the author's ideas (or biases), to assess the
historical or artistic significance of the book or to comment on how the book
fits in with issues raised in the class.   These categories do not exhaust the
possibilities.  You may also criticize or examine a _specific_ aspect of the
book that you think is important.

Responses must be clear, relevant, and analytical.  Responses must be word
processed or typewritten, they must be double spaced, and they must meet the
minimum standards of composition, grammar, and spelling demanded in the
introductory freshman writing course (English 101).  Papers handed in after a
reading has been discussed in class will be penalized by 10 percent.  Papers
more than a week past due will receive no credit.

**EXTRA CREDIT.** Extra credit is available. _See_ **[LATIN AMERICAN
FILMS.](sw_441films.htm)**

**RETURN TO TOP**

**GRADING SYSTEM.   **Quizzes=150 pts.; response papers=120 pts.;
participation=30 pts.   Letter grade equivalencies are based on a maximum
possible total of 300 pts.: A=270 or above; B=240-269; C=198-239; D=168-197;
F=below 168

**GRADUATE CREDIT.**    For graduate students, an additional objective of
History 441 is to  
become familiar with the most important historical literature in the field of
Latin American and  
Caribbean history, as well as some of the principal interpretive disputes. To
this end, if you are  
taking History 441 for graduate credit, in place of the three quizzes you will
prepare a historiographical essay, in which your purpose will be to analyze
and compare a significant body  
of secondary work on the topic of your choice.   It is highly recommended that
you meet regularly with me to discuss your project in person.  Graduate
students must arrange their first meeting with me **on or before Tues., June
6, 2000.   **All graduate papers are due on **Fri., July 7, 2000.    **If a
graduate student fails to submit an acceptable graduate project, the highest
grade he or she can receive in History 441 is D.  
    
**HONORS CREDIT.** Undergraduate students wishing to earn Honors (H) credit
for History 441 may do so by completing an individual project in addition to
the regular course requirements. Honors students must meet with the instructor
to discuss project possibilities **on or before Tues., June 6, 2000.** All
honors projects are due on **Fri., July 7, 2000.** It is not necessary to be
enrolled in the Honors Program to earn H credit. H credit may be awarded only
with a course grade of B or higher.

**AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT.**   If you require special testing or
classroom accommodations under the Americans with Disabilities Act, you must
meet with me as soon as possible so that I can make the necessary arrangements
early in the quarter.  All requests for accommodations under the ADA must be
accompanied by written certification from the Office of Disabled Student
Services, Wyly Tower 216, campus extension 3036.  
    
**ATTENDANCE POLICY**.   If you expect to do well in any course, you must
attend class regularly and punctually.  You (and only you) are responsible for
ensuring that you know what occurs in class, even if you are absent and
regardless of the reason for your absence.  When I determine the
"participation" component of the grade, class attendance is often a major
factor.  If you are not in class, you cannot participate; for this reason,
assignments involving class participation cannot be made up.  **_I do not
accept excuses, except for official university excuses._**   You are allowed
three absences without point penalty; if you are wise, you will save these
"free" absences in case you need them for an illness or other _bona fide_
emergency.

**ATTENDANCE AT SCHEDULED QUIZZES.** You are required to be present for
scheduled quizzes. Failure to do so will result in a grade of 0 (zero) for the
quiz. Make-up quizzes will be given **_at my discretion and at my convenience.
_** Ordinarily, this will require proper written documentation of a legitimate
medical emergency, military orders, court summons, or required participation
in an official University activity.

NO QUIZ WILL BE GIVEN EARLY, SO PLEASE DO NOT EMBARRASS US BOTH BY ASKING.  
    
UNIVERSITY POLICY PROHIBITS THE CONSUMPTION OF FOOD, DRINK, OR TOBACCO
PRODUCTS OF ANY KIND IN CLASSROOMS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.

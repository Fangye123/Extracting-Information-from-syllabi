>  ** B.A., M.A. in **** Psychology from Masaryk University, Brno, Czech

activities in the Center for Research of Children, Youth, and Family Social
Studies at Masaryk University in Brno and focus on the issues of ethnic
Minorities.

> **Olena Fedyuk - Ukraine  
>  ** B.A. in Education, personal statement: One of the reasons I decided to
apply to the Indigenous Nations Studies program was because of the issues in
my own country. It is amazing how much of the knowledge I have learned about
the effects of colonization is relevant to the situation we have in the
Ukraine.  
>  
>  I appreciate learning from other cultures because we each have something
valuable to share, knowledge that makes us unique but also unites us. The
Center for Indigenous Nations Studies provides a wonderful chance to learn and
help improve things in my country. I appreciate this opportunity and all the
supportive students and faculty in the program.  |

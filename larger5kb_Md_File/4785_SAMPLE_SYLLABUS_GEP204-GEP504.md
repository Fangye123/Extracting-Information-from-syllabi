COURSE DESCRIPTION:_**  
  
This course serves as an introduction to the world of maps - how to use,
interpret, and analyze maps to obtain information about a wide variety of
topics. Discussions include mental maps, aerial photos, remotely-sensed
images, computer-assisted cartography, and Geographical Information Systems
(GIS). Laboratory work includes digital map applications and GIS exercises.  
  
Through a series of lectures, written assignments, map interpretation
exercises, and computer cartography and GIS laboratory exercises, students are
taught the variety of ways mapping and GIS can be used in the natural and
social sciences and well as in many other fields.  
  
The course will cover the history of cartography, basic mapping processes, map
projections; scales and generalization, measurements from maps, terrain
representation, contour interpretation, topographic features, qualitative and
quantitative information, topographic features, use and understanding of
cartograms, thematic maps, graphs and charts, digital map applications, and
Geographical Information Systems.

**THE LURE OF MAPPING**

If you gather a group of people together and ask them about maps, you will
always get a lively response. Like the universal fascination with moving
water, or the dance of a fire's flame, maps hold some primal attraction for
the human animal....

In our consumer society, mapping has become an activity primarily reserved for
those in power, used to delineate the  "property" of nation states and
multinational companies. The making of maps has become dominated by
specialists who wield satellites and other complex machinery. The result is
that although we have great access to maps, we have also lost the ability
ourselves to conceptualize, make and use images of place - skills which our
ancestors honed over thousands of years....

Mapping can play a useful role in [the struggle to reclaim the commons]. The
destruction of land and culture caused by big business and centralized
government can be displayed visually with great effect. The wrong of
clearcutting, suburbs on farmland, or toxic dumps which, in isolation, may
seem unassociated, begin magically to communicate a larger evil when shown in
graphic relationship. The cruel division of classes and the allocation of
poverty based on race, sex, or age by the present political economy cannot be
hidden when charted across our urban neighborhoods.

Maps can show a vision for the future more clearly than thousands of
words...[However,] no map shows reality perfectly. A map is an icon - a potent
representation - but only a skeleton of what is real. The mistake of science
is that its goal is to describe the world as a complex machine, and to replace
the vagaries of nature's chaos with "management." Counter-mapping is about
something else: processes and relationships rather than disembodied facts. The
notion that only experts can map is the type of disenfranchisement that
[counter-mappers] confront and nullify. [The important thing is] the ability
to try [to map], to fill the world again with personal and communal
descriptions of time and space.

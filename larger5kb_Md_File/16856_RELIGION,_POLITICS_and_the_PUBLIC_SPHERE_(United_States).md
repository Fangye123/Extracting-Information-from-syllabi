In this seminar students will be introduced to questions surrounding the
relationships between religion and the public sphere in the United States. The
seminar will approach topics of civil religion, church-state relations,
religious pluralism in the public sphere, and the role of congregations in
local communities using sociological theories and methods. Students will write
a research paper based on one case, institution or event.

  * Attendance and participation in class discussion (20%)

integrating or juxtaposing ideas if possible. I will say more about these
essays on the first day of class.

research on historical or cross-national topics. A paper topic description
(one paragraph) is due by 20 March; if you wish me to read a preliminary
draft, you must submit it to me by 17 April.

Civil Religion I: public rituals and commemorations  
_The "nascent" and not so nascent Christian/Protestant aspects of Bellah's
interpretation of civil religion. How has this changed? How has this stayed
the same? What has been the impact of television/media on such public
events/rituals? What makes a public event or commemoration "religious"?_

**23 February**  
Civil Religion II: religious others  
_if certain dominant religious views help constitute an American "civil
religion," is there a contra-civil religion, or "uncivil" religions? How do
public events, rituals, and the media help form dominant understanding of
religious others? what does this say about the effects of religious pluralism
outlined by Berger and others?_

it succeed, and when does it not?_

  * Smith, Christian. _Resisting Reagan_. (Chicago, 1996). 

**29 March**  
Religious special interests: American Christianity and politics  
_Religious groups have had differential success when becoming involved in
politics. How do such groups frame their positions? Likewise, in recent times
we have heard more about the "success" of religious conservatives in pushing
moral agendas than of religious liberals. Why is this the case?_

**12 April Paper drafts due  
** The charitable impulse: Religious non-profit service organizations  
_Religious groups have often worked in the voluntary sector, providing succor
to the poor, hungry, and sick. As welfare and entitlements decrease in the
contemporary American scene, rhetoric suggesting that churches and communities
should provide for their own has increased. How have religious groups provided
for the poor, how are they doing so now, and what should we make of this
rhetoric?_

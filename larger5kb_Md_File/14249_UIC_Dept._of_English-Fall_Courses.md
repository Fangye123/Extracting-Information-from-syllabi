>>> The course will focus on British literature, with an emphasis on prose
fiction, that reflects the distinctive and sometimes contradictory
characteristics of British culture as it has developed since 1800. Since it
would be impossible in an introductory course such as this to include every
aspect of British culture, we will concentrate on defining what is counted as
British or specifically English culture, when and why, focussing in particular
on how class has contributed to and complicated this definition. We will also
examine the extent to which British colonialism has played a constitutive role
in defining Britain's national and cultural identity, and how that identity
has been changed by the dissolution of empire.

>>> This course is designed as a survey of African American literature of the
late eighteenth century through the nineteenth century. We will investigate
the variety of strategies, rhetorical and linguistic, employed by African
American writers for the purpose of resisting slavery and white supremacy and
for bringing about social, political and moral reform. We will discuss the
evolution of the terms of the debates surrounding slavery from the latter part
of the 18th century to the late 19th century, including some attention to the
philosophical discourse of "natural rights" and its dissemination. Some
comparisons with the emergent gender discourses of the period will be taken up
as well. The course encourages students to think broadly about the
interconnections between early African American texts and other early American
literary production. The grade for the course will be based on class
attendance, participation and presentations (30%), the midterm essay 4-5pp
(20%), the final essay 7-10pp (30%),and the final examination (20%).

>>> This honors seminar reads a variety of modern British texts (literary,
filmic, and visual) in which questions of blackness are central. More
specifically, we will debate the ways in which these diverse representation of
blackness and black peoples might be related to our understanding of "British"
national identity. At issue in the course are the key concepts of migration,
immigration, diaspora, identity and difference \- in other words, how, why,
and when blackness and black people ( which in Britain includes those of South
Asian, Caribbean, and African descent) have been important to the nation
consolidated in1707 as "Great Britain." Texts include; potraits by
Gainsborough; fiction by Samuel Selvon; slave narratives bymary Prince and
Olaudah Equiano; Mary Seacole's autobiographical narrative; Thakeray's Vanity
Fair; film and fiction by Hanif Kureishi; Sulman Rushdie's writing; letters by
Ignatius Sancho and more. Critical resources include works by Kobena Mercer;
paul Gilroy; Stuart Hall; Lola Young; Homi Bhabha; Kim Hall; Gauri
Viswanathan; Gayatri Spivak and others.

>>> In this introductory course students will write poetry in response to
assignments, ranging from the traditional to the experimental. A substantial
portion of class time will be given over to developing student approaches to
the assignments, and workshop discussions of the resulting student poetry will
be one of the principle activitites of the course. The course will also
involve students in reading a variety of poetries. Some poetry will be
assigned for class discussion and as models for writing assignments, but the
course will also provide for a broad, elective reading.

>>> An introductory survey of British literature from its beginnings through
the seventeenth century. The goals of the course are to familiarize students
with the writings of several major authors of the medieval and Renaissance
periods; to examine the development of dominant literary forms such as drama,
prose fiction, satire, and lyric and narrative poetry; to follow certain
recurring themes in works written over the course of several centuries; to
improve students' abilities to read literary texts closely and with
understanding; to develop their skill at writing about literature clearly and
perceptively; and to increase their awareness of the intimate connection
between literature and the culture in which it is produced. In addition to
regular reading assignments, the course's requirements will include two exams
(a midterm and a final), two short essays, and a series of weekly quizzes.
Textbook: The Norton Anthology of English Literature, Vol. I, 7th edition
(2000). This course is required for the literature option of the English major
and satisfies a requirement for the writing and English education options of
the major.

>>>  
>  This course surveys British literature ranging from the works of Alexander
Pope to Oscar Wilde. Our goal will be to read and critically examine a range
of works written in the eighteenth and ninteenth centuries, concentrating on
major developments in literary history. We will concentrate on sharpening our
skills as "close readers" of texts in a number of different genres--from the
Augustan verse epistles and satires to the Victorian novel and the decadent
wit of the late nineteenth century. We will also supplement our studies by
contextualizing these works within the specific discourses surrounding
historical developments from the Glorious Revolution to the Industrial
Revolution. Special attention will be given to the issues of nationalism and
imperialism, ethnic/racial/sexual identity, and to the phenomenon of "print
culture." Requirements include regular attendance and active participation, 3
papers (2 shorter, 1 longer), midterm and final examinations.

>>> Noble "I"'s

>>> This course will look at the appeal to nobility as a strategy of
legitimation in British literature from the rise of public culture in the
Eighteenth century through the Romantics to the Victorians. We will explore
various strategies of nobility and anti- nobility, looking at the ways in
which the ennobled (or anti-noble) self challenges conventions of speech and
class, constitutes community, and interrogates the relationship between
individual worth and national identity. Requirements include attendance,
thought papers, three formal papers, and a final exam.

>>> This course is designed as a survey of American Literature from the
Colonial Period to roughly the end of the 19th century. This is, of course,
one example of the many conventional periodizations and nationalizations of
literary texts in academia. While charting the traditional, and quite widely
anthologized, narrative of this kind of literary survey (i.e., paying
attention to matters of Puritanism, the Age of Reason, the revolutionary
period and the making of the new republic, and the rise of American
Romanticism and Transcendentalism), we will also be asking certain questions
of that narrative as we proceed. What are the politics of this kind of survey?
What texts and cultures does it privilege? What are some other ways of
reconceptualizing this national literary narrative? What is it about American
exceptionalism that makes it imperative to talk about "American" literature?
When does American literature become exceptional or unique? What kinds of
exclusions are at work to enable this narrative to persist so seemingly
authoritative and uncorrupted. We will be interested in the connections
between literary canon building and nation building. This will, of course,
entail asking questions related to the representations of race and slavery in
this time period as well as representations of women and "the woman question."
Readings will vary across genres and will be supplemented by critical and
historical essays. The grade for the course will be based on class
participation (including attendance and thought pieces) 20%, the take-home
midterm examination 20%, the final essay 40%, the final examination 20%.

>>> **Smokestacks and Skyscrapers**

>>>

>>> Throughout this course, students will read and discuss selections from
SMOKESTACKS AND SKYSCRAPERS: AN ANTHOLOGY OF CHICAGO WRITING (Chicago: Loyola
UP, 1999). As the selections are arranged chronologically, we will have the
opportunity to link Chicago writing with Chicago history. To create this link,
I plan to offer for our reading selected short articles representing crucial
periods of Chicago's history. In addition to this communal reading, each
student will be expected to independently read a prominent novel set in
Chicago. In response to the novel, each student will be expected to write an
essay that explores the significance of the text. The essay, which will also
be expected to refer to two or three critical articles on the novel, will be
about ten pages in MLA style. Some class meetings will be writing workshops
during which students will respond to one another's essay drafts throughout
the writing process. I will also be responding to each student's essay-in-
progress. All other class meetings will feature student-led discussions on the
significance of the anthology selections and the articles on history. Students
will be assessed on their attendance, their participation in discussions and
workshops, and on the quality of their writing. For undergraduate English
literature majors, English 252 satisfies the requirement for one of the
courses in the Culture, Theory, Genre, Language Group.

>>> Critical Theory: **Backgrounds and Currents**

>>>

>>> Course Description:

>>>

>>> This course will not only provide students with an overview of
contemporary movements in critical theory, but will also serve as an
introduction to the various philosophical and anti-philosophical traditions
against out of which and against which these movements arise. In this way not
only will what is genuinely iconoclastic and new in contemporary theory stand
out in greater relief, but those older questions and methods which repeat
themselves in contemporary theory will remind us of their urgency. "Theory"
will then appear not as something sprung full-grown from the forehead of
postmodernity, but as a set of discourses with its own determinants and its
own history. The dominant approach will not be one of simple genesis or
influence, since, as Borges once said, "every writer creates his own
precursors." Rather, the point will be to discover both how contemporary
theory re-invigorates older philosophical questions, and the extent to which
the historical situation of the late twentieth century called forth genuinely
new ways of thinking.

>>> This course is devoted to the close study of basic texts in literary
theory and criticism. The syllabus includes a selection of readings from
ancient times through the nineteenth century, but most of our attention will
be devoted to contemporary texts and trends. In order to understand how
various theories apply to--or conflict with--a specific literary work, we will
also use Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter (or another text) as a case study in
criticism. Requirements: written preparation for assigned readings; three
short writing assignments (late papers subject to penalties); pop quizzes;
three major tests; and class service (includes advance preparation,
participation in discussion, and short presentations). Attendance is
mandatory.

European literary theory and criticism from the twentieth-century. Our aim
will be to gain a greater understanding of the issues, practices and sources
of contemporary literary theory and criticism through close reading, careful
discussion and focused writing assignments. Whenever possible, we will make an
effort to compare the work of these theorists with one another as well as to
discuss their theory in the context of literary practice and philosophical
background. Special emphasis will be placed on reading Shakespeare's TEMPEST,
William Wordsworth's "Immortality Ode" and Kate Chopin's THE AWAKENING from a
number of different theoretical perspectives.

>>> CHINESE FILM - ART AND HISTORY

>>>

>>> This course will examine one Chinese feature film per week in order to
gain an understanding Of (a) the Chinese social, historical, political, and
economic milieu during the period covered; (b) Chinese literary and aesthetic
conventions; and (c) the nature and uses of film as a genre. We will begin
with the first Chinese films in the 1920s, and examine the development of the
cinema in China, but we will focus primarily on contemporary films from the
Peoples Republic of China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. Readings, viewings, and
class discussion will evaluate themes and characteristic styles of various
directors and genres, as well as how these films reveal and relate to broader
cultural patterns and social issues.

>>>

>>> Films will be screened on Thursdays, following a brief quiz based on the
readings assigned before the screening, and discussion afterwards. Tuesdays
will consist of lecture and discussion of issues related to the week's film.
Every week students are required to read approximately 1- 50 pages of assigned
reading, watch the film, and write a 1-2 page critique of the film. You will
also be required to write a longer analytical term paper (8-10 pages) on a
topic to be selected and pre-approved by the instructor.

>>> CANNIBAL FLOWER OR ELECT NATION: AMERICAN POETS IMAGINE AMERICA.

>>>

>>> The first few days of this course will explore the earliest American
concept of the New World as an "Elect Nation," a community encountering a
special position, responsibilities and temptations. The rest of the coursewill
consider American poets of the nineteenth and twentieth century and ief
Puritan readings, we will begin with Walt Whitman. We'll look at Robert
Frost's religious and national poems, then consider the reinterpretation of
Whitman's America by Hart Crane in THE BRIDGE. In conclusion we'll look at
Robert Lowell's subversive psychological revisioning of the earliest
traditions, Elizabeth Bishop's meditations on our landscape, Robert Hayden's
"cannibal flower" America and Allen Ginsberg's apocalyptic visions of the
nation in the late twentieth century. Good skills in literary analysis will be
most helpful for this course, as will rigorous preparation and active
participation in discussion of our texts; something written will be due every
day of class.

>>> This particular version of 305 will be of particular interest to
prospective teachers of 6-12 English, particularly in--but not limited to--
Chicago Public Schools. We will read a variety of YA novels, putting special
emphasis on how to integrate such works in the existing curriculum. While we
will read some "classics" of YA lit, but we will also read very recent works
that focus on Chicago neighborhoods. We will read a few books in common, and
some essays about the teaching of YAliterature, but we will also have the
opprtunity to read in small "book clubs" and in individual projects of our own
devising.

>>> Some Definitions of Metafiction  
>  "A self-conscious novel, briefly, is a novel that systematically flaunts
its own condition of artifice and that by doing so probes into the problematic
relationship between real-seeming artifice and reality" (Robert Alter). "This
intense self-reflexiveness of metafiction is caused by the fact that the only
certain reality for the metafictionist is the reality of his own discourse;
thus, his fiction turns in upon itself, transforming the process of writing
into the subject of writing" (Mas'ud Zavarzadeh). "Metafiction, as it has now
been named, is fiction about fictionthat is, fiction that includes within
itself a commentary on its own narrative and/or linguistic identity" (Linda
Hutcheon). "Metafiction refers to other fictions, not to worlds outside or
beyond, not to reality" (Hans Skei). "In providing a critique of their own
methods of construction, such writings not only examine the fundamental
structures of narrative fiction, they also explore the possible fictionality
of the world outside the literary fictional text" (Patricia Waugh).
"Metafictionsfictions which examine fictional systems, how they are created,
and the way in which reality is transformed by and filtered through narrative
assumptions and conventions" (Larry McCaffery). "Because they do not seek to
tell yet another story but to examine the story-telling process itself,
reflexive novels must be seen as works of literary theory and criticism"
(Michael Boyd). "In the final analysis reflexivity is a way of understanding
the semiotic, philosophical and ideological processes taking place in any
narrative alongside those issues our existing poetics equips us to find"
(Robert Siegle).

>>> Course Description  
>  Metafiction is a controversial topic, and perhaps raises more questions
than answers. As the definitions above indicate, there is little consensus as
to what it is. Nevertheless, raising the possibility of metafiction as a
distinct sub-genre of the novel raises a number of interesting questions that
we will explore in this course. What is the nature of fiction? What is its
relationship to reality? How does contemporary literary theory problematize
the fiction/reality distinction? What is the relationship of literary
criticism to fiction? Is fiction that draws attention to its status as fiction
a distinct genre of fiction? Is fiction that comments on its own identity as
fiction even logically possible? What if any difference is there between the
postmodern fiction and metafiction? Between the modern novel and metafiction?
Between literary theory and metafiction? Through a close reading of a number
of "alleged" metafictions including texts by Jorge Luis Borges, Alain Robbe-
Grillet, Samuel Beckett, Italo Calvino, John Fowles, Julio Cortazar, William
Gass and Umberto Eco, we aim to address these and related questions. By
reading these works of "meta-fiction" along with related and relatable works
of theory, we not only hope to gain more insight into these metafictional
worlds, but also to problematize the distinction between "theory" and
"fiction". In a more practical sense, many of the works of literary theory and
criticism will simply help us to become more observant of some of the basic
elements of fiction: point of view, narrative, mimesis vs. diegesis, plot, and
character. These elements will be introduced in a thoughtful and challenging
way. Active student participation will be encouraged.

>>> Since the 1920s, critics have regularly made comparisons between the works
of Conrad and Melville. This course explores the relationship between the two
authors further, examining interconnections among both short and longer works.
Texts will include Melville's TYPEE, MOBY-DICK, and PIERRE and Conrad's "Heart
of Darkness," LORD JIM, and NOSTROMO. Requirements will include two papers, a
midterm, and a final.

>>> This course will explore ten-eleven of Shakespeare's plays written
throughout his dramatic career, including comedies, histories, tragedies, and
one romance. The course will focus on the ways in which the plays represent
the formation of female and male identities; the construction of heroism in
different forms of drama; shifting conceptions of sexuality; and conflicted
representations of political authority, race, and social class. We will also
consider scenes from some modern film versions of the plays. The required text
is The Norton Shakespeare, edited by Stephen Greenblatt, Walter Cohen, Jean
Howard, and Katharine Maus.

>>> In this section of the Major Plays of Shakespeare we will study a
selection of William Shakespeare's most important plays. Over the course of
the semester we will consider and discuss two of the major strains in
Shakespeare criticism: one, that the Bard's works speak to us across time i.e.
that their meaning is universal and timeless; and two, that Shakespeare's
works are a reflection of their time and place and that they must be
interpreted in that light. Particular attention will be paid to the different
ways in which each of these critical traditions construes identity categories
such as race, class, gender, and nation. We will examine a number of film
versions of the plays under discussion and, if possible, we will attend a live
performance in a local theater. Course requirements will include, but will not
be limited to: 2-3 short papers, a film or theater review, and a final exam.

>>> This course will treat eight of Shakespeare's best-known plays: MIDSUMMER
NIGHT'S DREAM, TWELFTH NIGHT, RICHARD II, 1 HENRY IV, HAMLET, KING LEAR,
OTHELLO, and WINTER'S TALE. They will be covered in some detail, with
attention to understanding the meaning of the Elizabethan English and
developing a sense of how they would have been originally staged. As the
semester progresses we will examine different critical ways of approaching
these texts (e.g. Marxist, feminist, queer, new historicist). With the help of
video clips, we will also sample some modern stagings. Midterm and final exam;
occasional quizzes if warranted; some short memorization exercises; three
papers (ranging from three to six pages in length each). The class will be
conducted as a discussion with occasional short lectures. The bookstore will
stock paperback copies of the individual plays.

>>> Literary Awards and Literary Cultures: **Ideologies of the National Book
Award and the Booker Prize**

>>>

>>> There is perhaps no better way to illustrate the difference in the
literary cultures of the United Kingdom and the United States than to point to
the nationally-televised Booker Prize award ceremony as compared with the
scant and almost invisible notice accorded the National Book Award in the
United States. This course will examine the contrasts in these literary
cultures by studying not only the last five winners of each award but also the
reviews, commentaries, and controversies which those works and those awards
provoked. We will endeavor to map the aesthetics and politics of each literary
culture and examine the extent to which the winning novels could be said to
reflect the concerns and anxieties of a national or commonwealth
consciousness. In our discussion of the texts, we will focus on two main
questions: what makes each text literary? and how does that literariness
reflect an idea of a national or commonwealth culture?

>>>

>>> In addition to reading the winning novels of the last five years, students
will be required to read book reviews and relevant commentaries. Students will
also be required to keep a reading journal, to write two book reviews of their
own, and to write a ten-page essay. The course will culminate in the final
weeks with the presentation of arguments for each text and a class vote to
determine the English 398 Honors Seminar Book Award.

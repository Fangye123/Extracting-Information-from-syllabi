**OVERVIEW:**   Computational Neuroscience refers to application of methods
and techniques from computer science to research in neuroscience, and to the
view of the nervous system as a joint computational-biological entity.
Research in this area presumes a solid grounding in multiple disciplines.
CN580 will focus on building a firm background in neuroscience, which will be
provided by a "standard" background supplied by a text like Kandel and
Schwartz, but supplemented by more sophisticated readings from the literature
of biophysics and neuroscience. Computational approaches, including derivation
of equations, numerical simulation, and modeling will be stressed in all
areas. The course will focus on three spatial scales in the nervous system:
membrane, neuronal, and supra-neuronal. Membrane biophysics will be covered at
the level of the Nernst, Goldman, Hodgkin-Huxley and Fitzhugh-Nagumo
equations, and later simplifications. Simulators, such as SPICE, NEURON,
GENESIS, or the equivalent will be studied. Basic passive(RC) and active
(transistor, op amp, vco) circuit analysis, and modern VLSI metaphors for
neuronal activity, will be reviewed. Statistical approaches to spike train
analysis based on Bayesian, Poisson, and Wiener kernel approaches will be
reviewed. Map and column architectures of visual cortex will be surveyed as an
example of supra-neuronal approaches to neural modeling, and as an
introduction to CN780 (Research Topics in Computational Neuroscience).  
  

* * *

**REQUIREMENTS:** Students will be assigned selected readings. Some background
readings from Principles of Neural Science (Fourth Edition) by Eric. R.
Kandel, James H. Schwartz and Thomas M. Jessell (Elsevier) will be assigned,
along with readings in a variety of other texts and primary sources, which
will be available as reprints in the CNS library. The use of simulators will
be explored in class, including one or more of the choice from Neuron,
Genesis, Spice, and Matlab. Manuals and descriptive information for these will
be available in the CNS library under the course designation CN580.

There will be a mid-term exam (in class) and a final (in class) exam. Problem
sets, or brief literature reviews, will be assigned during class. The reading
for a given lecture is due on the date of that lecture. The final grade will
be weighted equally between the mid-term, the final, and the homework.

**E-MAIL** An alias CN580 will be set up and used to broadcast information to
students enrolled in CN580.

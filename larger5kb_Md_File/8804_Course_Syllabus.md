**CLASS DISTURBANCES:**  
No student should feel compelled against his or her will to attend this class.
Naturally, each and every student enrolled in History 102 remains responsible
for the History 102 course materials, assignments, deadlines, in-class
announcements, and examinations, regardless of whether or not they choose to
attend class. It is the assumption of the professor that those students who do
attend class do so to attend his lectures and to focus on class instruction.
For this reason the professor will not tolerate class disturbances or
interruptions during his lectures. The professor welcomes any and all student
questions, as indicated by raising one's hand. Private in-class discussions
otherwise cannot be tolerated. Any student found to be causing a disturbance
in the History 102 classroom will be subject, without further warning, to
immediate and automatic expulsion from class. Readmittance will be determined
through direct consultation with the professor at his office.

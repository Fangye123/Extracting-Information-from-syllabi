**Course Description.**  
  
This course will concentrate on using various software applications to solve
mathematics problems, to organize pedagogical demonstrations, and to set up
problem explorations. Students on campus will use application software owned
by the Department of Mathematics Education and will carry out the course using
primarily MacIntosh computers. All materials for the course are maintained by
an Internet Web page site and students will create and use web documents in
the course. Students off campus who have access to their own server have an
option put their web productions on their own server and link to the course
page.  
  
The emphasis is on exploration of various mathematics contexts to learn
mathematics, to pose problems and problem extensions, to solve problems, and
to communicate mathematical demonstrations.  
  
The following software will be used:

### Graphing Calculator 3.1 or 3.2

  
**Graphing Calculator 3.1** is the new version of a computer program, Graphing
Calculator, that comes bundled with PowerPC computers. It is available on all
machines in our laboratory in Room 111/113. Version 3.1 or 3.2 will graph
relations (implicit functions) as well as functions, and can be used for
parametric equations, polar equations, 3D graphs, and more. See
**[http://www.pacifict.com](http://www.pacifict.com/)**. It is available for
purchase from the web site for either Macintosh Power PC computers or Windows
computers. For Windows the program is called **NuCalc 2.0.** A beta version of
NuCalc 3.0 is being tested this summer. NuCalc 2.0 files doe NOT transfer to
the Macintosh platform. NuCalc 3.0 files WILL transfer.

>  

### Geometer's Sketchpad.

> GSP is a dynamic geometric construction package with features that include
construction tools, measurement tools transformation tools, and animation
tools. Geometer's Sketchpad is published by **[Key Curriculum
Press](http://www.keypress.com/)**. We are using version 4.01. Version 4.01
has many features not available in Version 3.0 and does some tasks
differently. GSP is available for both Macintosh and Windows and files
transfer from one platform to the other.

>  For a GSP with a Script Tool example **[click here](GSP/PentagonST.gsp)**.
When the script screen opens in GSP, open a new sketch and select two points,
as instructed, to  "play" the script.  
>  
>  Patterns formed by concentric pentagons rotating in opposite ways are shown
in **[Pentamotion](GSP/pentamotion.gsp).**

>

> * * *

### Excel

> Excel is a second generation spreadsheet program that allows creation and
manipulation of a data array and the immediate graphing of selected subsets of
the array. It is a part of MicroSoft Office that is widely used on both
Windows and MacIntosh platforms.

### xFunction

> xFunction is a freeware program for graphing functions, displaying
information on functions, and other utilities.

### Tool programs for word processing and drawing.

> It is useful to be able to go from any application program to present output
within a discussion and to print that discussion on the printed page.
Microsoft Word is one of several word processing programs available. Various
"paint" programs provide useful drawing capabilities.

### PageMill 3.0.

Pagemill is one of many utility programs available for creating HTML documents
for Web sites. It is our choice for the computers in Room 111/113. Other such
utilities, such as Microsoft Word, Netscape Composer, or Clarisworks can be
used. Any HTML editor will be okay.

### Project InterMath.

> Project **[InterMath](http://www.intermath-uga.gatech.edu/)**  
>  
>  is a National Science Foundation supported project to introduct mathematics
technology to middles school amathematics teachers and help them improve their
mathematics baqckground. It implements a similar instructional philosop0ay to
this course but at the middle school level.

###  
A note on EMAT 4690/6690.  

>  
>  EMAT 4690/6690 is a follow-up course to EMAT 4680/6680 offered usually
Spring semester and it is an extension of EMAT 4680/6680 in two senses. First
it allows more advanced use of these software packages as well as other
applications. Second, it emphasizes the development of _units_ of material
(e.g. sequences of lessons) that might be used with secondary school students.

###  
  
A note on programming.

>  
>  
>  In the past EMAT 4680/6680 has had a heavy emphasis on programming in BASIC
or LOGO. We feel the development of very general and very powerful
applications (such as Graphing Calculator 2.1, Algebra Xpresser, GSP,
Workstation, or Theorist) makes the need for programming less of a priority
than in the past. In fact, setting up the programs to run particular problems
and to explore particular situations is a form of natural language
programming. The use of such applications is much more relevant to school
mathematics instruction than writing programs in BASIC or LOGO.

### Course Assignments

>  
>  
>  There is no textbook.  
>  
>  The class will use fully ethernet networked computers in Room 111/113. All
assignments will be given and turned in via the Web Site at
<[http://jwilson.coe.uga.edu](../Default.html)> or placed on the student's own
web server and linked to this Web Site. We will have access to and learn to
use various network tools.  
>  
>  
>  For those who can not resist killing off a few trees, there is a printer .
. .

###  
  
Time on computers

>  
>  
>  You can not expect to accomplish what you should from this course without
time on the computers that is in addition to the time we have in class. The
usual expectation of 2 hours study outside of class for every hour in class is
probably a minimum. There are several MacIntosh laboratories available in this
building and across campus.

###  
  
A note on computers

>  
>  
>  We are scheduled to hold this class in Room 111/113 with a laboratory of
Macintosh G3 and G4 computers. The G3 and G4 are in the family of advanced
computers in the MacIntosh line. There are some additional PowerPC Macintosh
computers in Room 228, Room 615, and in the EMAT office area.  
>  
>  
>  In general, the application programs we will use in this class will run on
any of the Macintosh computers except the oldest machines. There are
distinctions such as operating systems and hard disk drives that have to be
accounted for. If you have your own Mac, or access to one, I will help you get
set up to run these programs on it (if it is possible)  
>  
>  Most Macs today run with operating system 8.6, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2.2, or 10.0.5.
In general, as operating systems have improved over time, most people move to
the newest system. Our machines in Room 111/113 use System 9.2.2. The new Mac
OS X is very different. It can be switched on for some of the machines in Room
111/113.  
>  
>  Most of our software is also available for Windows machines. The
functionality of some other Windows software is similar to what we use.
Certainly the Windows environment could be used for implementing this course.
Students can work at home on a Windows computer and transport to these Rm
111/113 machines via removable media (e.g. floppy disks) or the network. It is
also possible to set up FTP access to the server so that your web productions
can be implemented from a remote site. Expect to experience a few hang-ups but
it will work. Further, software or hardware with similar functionality is
available on many hand-held devices.

###  
  
Grades and Requirements

>  
>  
>  Grading is a necessary part of what we do and it is my intention to base
grades on performance in meeting the requirements of the course. This
performance includes the following:

1\. Attendance  
2\. Participation

on the computer  
working with others  
class discussions  
investigations

3\. Write-ups  
  
4\. Final Projects

> I think # 1 and # 2 are rather obvious. We will have repeated opportunities
to discuss #3 and # 4. But for the terminally anxious. . .  
>  
>  **A**. There will be 13 **Assignments**. These are guides or suggestions
for explorations and participation arranged around a variety of topics. There
will be a  " **Write-up** " for each assignments except Assignment 0.  
>  
>  No. You do not need to "hand in" each assignment. You do not even have to
do them. It is hard to imagine how you could benefit from the class if you
avoid them. . . .  
>  
>  **B**. Each person will develop a personal Web Page for the course.  
>  
>  **C**. There will be a set of  "Write-up" projects. These are the
"homework" for the course. The Write-ups will be prepared as an HTML document
(i.e. a Web Page document) and linked to your personal web page.  
>  
>  **D**. The Final Projects are in lieu of a final examination, will take
considerably longer than an examination, and is due on the day of our
scheduled final examination.  
>  
>  **E**. **[What is a WRITE-UP?](writeup.html)**

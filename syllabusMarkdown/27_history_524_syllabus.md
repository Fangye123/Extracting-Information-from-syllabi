 In the middle of the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln in his December 1,
1862, message to Congress said:

 Fellow citizens, we cannot escape history.  We will be remembered in spite of
ourselves.  No personal significance or insignificance can spare one or
another of us . . ..

We, too, cannot escape history.  This course provides an in-depth examination
of the "middle period" in nineteenth century American history from
approximately 1840 to 1877.  Divided into three sections, the first section of
the course covers the 1840s and 1850s to 1861.  The second part of the course
is the war years of 1861-1865 while the third part of the course is the period
of Reconstruction, 1863-1877.  The social, economic, diplomatic, legal,
constitutional, and military aspects of the period will be studied.

Course Requirements:  This course meets the Historical Studies component of
the General Education requirements and is approved for WR credit.  Lectures on
appropriate days with discussions of the readings highlight the major
arguments and issues.  Student questions are welcomed at all times and
students are expected to participate in the discussions.  Students are
responsible for all material covered in the lectures, discussions, and
readings.  Students will complete a mid-term examination, a comprehensive
final examination, a term research paper (style sheets will be provided), and
an analytical book review.  Graduate students are expected to read more widely
and produce more written work than undergraduate students.

Due Dates:  Students are expected to be complete all assignments on the dates
listed on the course syllabus.  No make-up examinations are given.  Only those
students with proven University-approved excuses may ask for a make-up.

Grading:  Book review, 20%; mid-term, 25%; final exam, 25%; research paper,
30%.  The final exam is Comprehensive.  Caution--the grader is not a mind
reader.  All examinations, quizzes, and papers will be graded on what is
written, not on what the student subsequently decides she or he "really
meant."

Term Paper:  Term paper proposal; one (1) page, 250 words.  
             First paper up-date; two (2) pages, 500 words.   
             Second paper up-date; five (5) pages, 1250 words.   
             Book reviews will be marked and returned to students for rewriting and correction.   
 Term paper -- minimum of fifteen (15) text-length pages; twenty-five (25)
text-length pages for graduate students that includes a historiographical
section.  All term papers must contain both footnotes and bibliography.  Note:
One letter grade will be deducted from the student's final paper grade for
every page below the minimum text-length page requirement.  For example, if
the student produces a "C" paper but it is only 13 text-pages long, the
paper's final grade will be an "F."  
 One-third of letter grade will be deducted from the student's final paper
grade for every incorrect use of "its, it's, and it is" and for every run-on
sentence in the student's final term paper.  For example, if the student
produces an "A" paper but the paper contains three incorrect uses of "its,
it's or it is" and one run-on sentence, the paper's final grade will be a
"B-."  For more information, see the "Style Sheet."

Reading Assignment:  Students should start reading Donald, Documents 1-12 in
Gienapp, and Foner's book.  A separate assignment sheet will be distributed
explaining the analytical book review assignment.  Although class lectures may
fall behind the reading, remember that it is easier for the instructor to
catch up to the reading than it is for the students to cram reading for the
exams.

Important Dates:  
Book review due, September 11.  
Mid-term exam, October 4.  
Last day to drop, October 11.  
Research paper due, November 29.  
Final examination, Tuesday, December 11, 2001, 11:30 A.M.- 2:00 P.M.

Plagiarism:  Students must not plagiarize, which is the use of primary or
secondary materials without proper citation in the footnotes, endnotes, or in
the work.  Plagiarism is theft of intellectual property and plagiarism results
in the immediate failure of the assignment and/or worse

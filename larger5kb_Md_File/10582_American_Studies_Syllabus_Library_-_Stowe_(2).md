###  **Course description**  

Over the last two hundred and fifty years the human body has been viewed,
displayed, dissected, and discussed in ways that both reflect and contradict
the culture and politics of the times. Whether cursed and dismembered or
adorned and fetishized, the body has always been a site of intense meaning and
the locus of immense power. This class surveys doctrines and theories about
sexuality and the human body and their place in science, nature, and culture.

The ideas and materials we will analyze are situated at the intersection of
history, medicine, anthropology, art, philosophy, religion, politics, race,
gender, and economics. For example, physical anthropologists measured skulls
and muscle strength to construct a hierarchy of races. Industrialists and
their agents sought to understand the worker's body as a machine which was  
subject to inefficiency and fatigue. Doctors saw the body as both a vessel for
pathogens and illness as well as a tableaux for construction and correction,
through amputation, plastic surgery, and orthopedics. Additionally, the built
and lived environment was a constant hazard and a site of accidents, disaster,
and explosions which literally catapulted individuals into new relationships
with body aesthetics, social welfare, and economics.

Caution: this is not a class for the faint of heart or the squeamish. We will
look at and discuss sometimes shocking, and at other times rather repulsive,
images and ideas. This involves the material culture of bodies, including
medical instruments, and the texts that illustrate their use.

###  **Course requirements**  

Grades will be based upon the following:

Attendance and participation: 30%.  
You should come to each class with two or three questions you might pose to
yourself and to the class in response to the readings and on-going
discussions. Attendance and participation are crucial to your grade.

Literature review on a topic of your choice: 35%.  
The essay should be 8-10 pages in length and include 8-10 sources. The
literature review of graduate students should be 15-20 pages and include 15-20
sources. Due last week of class.

Material or visual essay of 6-8 pages: 35%.  
This essay is an analysis/discussion of a non-print (that is, not book,
article, manuscript) item related to sexuality. This might be an object,
photograph, post card, engraving, etc.

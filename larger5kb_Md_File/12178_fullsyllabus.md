**COURSE SYLLABUS**

**PREFIX, NUMBER AND TITLE:** Hist 152: History of the United States Since
1865

**CREDIT HOURS:** 3 Semester Hours

**APPROVED COURSE DESCRIPTION:** Our nation's problems in the post-Civil War
period: rise of urbanism, problems of industrialization, rise of the nation as
a world power and conflicts of the present century.

**MY COURSE DESCRIPTION** : This course focuses on the development of American
History from the Civil War to the present. We will concentrate on
understanding the dynamics of "big" changes in America history; the social,
political, economic, intellectual, and cultural transformations that have
shaped and continue to shape our nation. The course will be structured around
several major themes, among them: class, race, gender, family and something we
call "collective mentalitie" for the selected period. At the same time we will
examine the varieties of history and will look at how historians set about
understanding and explaining the past.

**PREREQUISITES:** None

>> POLICIES:  
>  1\. Attendance is required! For every absence after the third unexcused
absence, your final grade will be dropped by one letter. For example, if you
have a 100% for your grade, but you have missed five classes, your final grade
will be a C.  
>  2\. Extra credit work is not accepted nor is it assigned. All course
requirements must be met to receive a passing grade. Meaning all assigned work
and tests must be turned in to pass.  
>  3\. Written work **must be** submitted on the due date. (see course
assignments for due dates) I will review rough drafts for content. **Late work
of any kind will not be accepted**!  
>  4\. Your active participation in class is part of your grade and is
expected. Attendance alone is not participation, but attendance is a part of
participation.  
>  5\. All papers must be edited (proofread, spell checked, grammar check,
etc.) **before** the paper is turned in! If not, they will be returned without
a grade.  
>  6\. Assigned readings for the day should be completed before class. Bring
the text under discussion to class, along with paper for notes and a writing
tool.  
>  7\. Talking in class to each other is not tolerated. Talking during
discussions is encouraged.  
>  8\. On test days, no hats will be allowed in class. Test must be written
out/answered in blue or black pen - not pencil.  
>  9\. Quizzes on the readings my be substituted for written assignments at
the instructor's discretion.

find anyone plagiarizing, I will pursue that case to the fullest extent of the
university policy.

exam within one week of returning to classes/campus. If you do not complete
the exam within one week, the grade for the exam will be 0. In addition, all
make-up exam are essay exams.

**A SPECIAL NOTE ON PLAGIARISM:**

> I have included a brief section on citation along with your paper topics.
_In A Pocket Guide to Writing in History,_ Mary Lynn Rampolla defines
plagiarism. Her definition is the generally accepted definition for students,
professionals, and others writing in history. I will hold your papers to her
standard. **Anyone plagiarizing in this course will receive an F**.

>

>> When you derive facts and ideas from other writers' work, you must cite the
sources of your information. Not to give credit for borrowed material is
plagiarism, a very serious academic offense. Most writers are aware that they
must cite the sources of direct quotations, but you must also provide citation
for _all_ information derived from another source, **even if you have
summarized or paraphrased the information**. [emphasis mine] You must also
cite your sources when you use other writers' interpretations of a historical
event or text. Citing sources enables your readers to distinguish between your
ideas and those of others.

>

> The only exception is that you do not need to provide citations for
information that is common knowledge. For example, you might have learned from
a particular book that the Civil War spanned the years 1861-1865, but you do
not have to cite the book when you include this fact in your paper. You could
have obtained the time span of the Civil War from any number of sources
because it is common knowledge. The more your read about your subject, the
easier it will for you to distinguish common knowledge from information for
which you need to provide a citation. When in doubt, it is better to be safe
and cite the source. [[1]](sp97am.htm#FOOTNOTE_1)

>

> **To give you an example of plagiarism and what exactly constitutes
plagiarism, pay close attention to the following:**  
>  When you summarize or paraphrase, it is not enough to name the source; you
must restate the source's meaning using your own words. You are guilty of
plagiarism if you borrow strings of words without using quotation marks or if
you closely mimic an author's sentence structure. The following paraphrases
are plagiarized - even though the source is cited - because their language is
too close to that of the original source.

>

> **ORIGINAL VERSION**  
>  If the existence of a signing ape was unsettling for linguists, it was also
startling news for animal behaviorists. (Davis, Eloquent Animals, p. 26)

>

> **UNACCEPTABLE BORROWING OF WORDS**  
>  The existence of a signing ape unsettled linguists and startled animal
behaviorists. (Davis, p. 26)

>

> **UNACCEPTABLE BORROWING OF STRUCTURE**  
>  If the presence of a sign language using chimp was disturbing for
scientists studying language, it was also surprising to scientists studying
animal behavior. (Davis, p. 26)

>

> **ACCEPTABLE PARAPHRASES**  
>  When they learned of an ape's ability to use sign language, both linguists
and animal behaviorists were taken by surprise (Davis, p. 26). Or

>

> According to Flora Davis, linguists and animal behaviorists were unprepared
for the news that a chimp could communicate with its trainers through sign
language. (Davis, p. 26). [[2]](sp97am.htm#FOOTNOTE_2)

>

> **A TIP -**  
>  To avoid plagiarizing an author's language resist the temptation to look at
the source while you are summarizing or paraphrasing. Close the book write
from memory, and then open the book and check for accuracy. This technique
prevents you from being captivated by the words on the page.

>> **To understand how these descriptions apply to a grade on an essay
question:**  
>  **_A exam_** \- presents a conceptional approach to the answer. Your
argument is clearly and forcefully stated, your writing is clear and follows
grammatical conventions of usage. You use the facts and evidence you have;
reading, lectures, discussions, to further your argument. You do not merely
summarize the readings.  
>  **_B exam_** \- attempts to make an argument, but is unclear in logic and
construction. You drift from argument to summary of the readings. You
demonstrate some familiarity with the material covered in class, but have not
mastered an understanding of these readings.  
>  **_C exam_** \- summarizes the readings. While essentially correct in the
facts presented, this essay lacks an argument, lacks control or mastery of the
materials covered, is not original nor perceptive in the presentation of the
materials.  
>  **_D exam_** \- presents faulty or incomplete information, makes little or
no attempt to construct an argument, has a passing awareness of the readings,
class lectures, and discussions.

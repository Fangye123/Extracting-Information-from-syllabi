### POLITICAL SCIENCE 300  
FOUNDATIONS OF POLITICAL SCIENCE  
Fall, 1998  
Dr. Kim Hill



**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course is a survey of the scholarly discipline of political science, the
subfields of the discipline, the major research questions and modes of
scholarship in the latter subfields, and the character of the discipline as a
profession. One of the goals of the course is to give students a strong
grounding in the intellectual concerns of the discipline and in how they are
reflected in the actual work of scholars in the field. Another goal is to
acquaint students with the opportunities and challenges afforded by a career
as a political scientist and with how a degree in political science can be
used in nonacademic careers and for applied purposes.



**REQUIRED READINGS**

All of the readings for the course are included in a coursepack that is
available for purchase at Notes-N-Quotes (112 Nagle across University Drive
from Blocker Bldg., 846-2255). The individual readings required for each class
session are listed in the class schedule below.



**THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CLASS**

Some of our class sessions will be devoted to discussions of general topics
such as "What is political science as a field?" "What kind of science is
political science?" and "How does political science achieve progress?" The
remaining class sessions will be devoted to reviews of the character and
status of some of the most important subfields of political science--the topic
areas where individual scholars specialize in their research and teaching. We
will typically spend one week (two classes) on each of these subfields. For
the first class we will read an article or book chapter that surveys the
progress and development of that field. In the second class we will typically
read and dliscus~; a sinrile research article or book chapter that illustrates
a particular kind of theoretical development or applied, real-world
application of research in the field under study. In the final class sessions
on "applied political science" we will discuss various professional
opportunities for which a degree in political science is especially
appropriate.

  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

There will be two examinations, both of which will be take-home, open-book
essay exams. You will also have to write one research paper that investigates
career opportunities in one particular profession and how knowledge of
political science is applicable to the work in that profession. Each exam and
the paper will constitute thirty percent of your final grade, while class
participation will count for 10 percent of it.

The overall class participation grade will reflect your grades on: (1) short
quizzes in class on each day marked in the syllabus as one where the topic is
"FOR CLASS DISCUSSION," (2) completion of the "class participation" assignment
during the first two weeks of class, and (3) other participation in class as
by offering comments and questions on the regular lecture material.

More, quite-explicit details of the paper assignment will be provided later.

No extra-credit work will be accepted.



**COURSE POLICIES**

Regular class attendance is expected of all students, and both attendance and
active participation in class discussions will be reflected in the final
grades in the class.

You must have a University excused absence or a pre-arranged agreement with me
for missing a regularly scheduled exam or turning in your paper or an exam
late. Otherwise, late work will suffer a grade penalty, varying in severity
depending on how late the work is turned in. Plagiarism or other cheating on
an exam or the paper will result in an F in the course.

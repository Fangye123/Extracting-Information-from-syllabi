##  What is Technical Writing?

In _Technical Writing,_ Michael Markel defines this type of writing as
follows:

Technical writing conveys specific information about a technical subject to a
specific audience for a specific purpose. (2)

You might also want to look at some other definitions given by different
technical writing web sites. Using your textbook's functional definition of
technical writing as work always written for a specific purpose and to a
specific audience, we will look at the ways to best shape such communications.
We will study various forms of technical writing ranging, including those
presented in a traditional linear format (such as memos, letters, instruction
manuals, proposals, and different types of written reports) and those in an
on-line hypertext format (such as on-line help and Word Wide Web pages). After
studying a particular type of document, you will write one yourself.

##  Course Requirements

In this course, you will read and study technical documents before attempting
to write such documents yourself. You will refine your writing and editing
skills both by revising work of your own, and by participating in workshops
where we critique each other's prose. Final drafts of all papers must be word
processed and in a format which would be acceptable in a professional setting.
You will be required to complete and turn in some of these documents in the
English Computer Lab.

With the principle firmly in mind that the most engaging and effective writing
springs from effective thinking, and effective thoughts from principled
living, we will examine use the paradigm presented in Stephen R. Covey's _The
Seven Habits of Highly Effective People_ , with the goal of incorporating
these habits into our writing process. At the same time, we will look at
formal stylistic elements--such as writing precise active sentences,
incorporating appropriate graphics, and designing striking pages--which can
help accentuate your prose.

 Finally, each student will be required to give an oral presentation of his or
her semester project during our scheduled final exam period or the final week
of class.

All work in this course will be discussed and graded within the framework of
one overarching question: would it stand out or at a minimum appear competent
if produced or delivered within a professional workplace? Within that
framework, we will stress that "technical" does not mean "mechanical." To
truly stand out, a technical document requires the same creative thought and
careful shaping one expects from the most insightful argumentative essays

In addition, coursework will consist of reading, lectures, and class workshops
and discussions. Your participation in these workshops is vital to both your
improvement and that of your fellow students: remember that technical writing
is an act of communication to a specific audience, and so cannot be practiced
without such an audience. Active participation is required for you to complete
and pass this course. Also, as specified in the student conduct code, any
apparent scholastic dishonesty (such as plagiarism) will result in a minimum
penalty of failing that assignment, and the likely penalty of failing the
course.

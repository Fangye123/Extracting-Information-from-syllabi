Course Description:

Britain, the island nation, is frequently represented as a discrete and
unified polity, a state whose natural and symbolic borders coincide. This
course will examine conflicts over British identity that strained and ruptured
these neat boundaries during the 1980s. In particular, we will trace the
relation between constructions of "race," gender and sexual orientation and
the national imaginary. Struggles over imaginary geographies, over the social
production of space, are particularly germane to the constitution of the
British nation given the imperial formation of Englishness and the legacy of
racial pluralism bequeathed by colonialism and the migrant labor market of the
post-war period. Differing models of gender identity played a role in these
struggles, as familial and national space were cross-modelled within dominant
discourses to create non porous, hierarchical images of the nation. The course
will be focused specifically on writers and cultural activists whose work
contested the proliferation of ethnically based, exclusionary definitions of
national identity during the Thatcher years. Discussion of such artists will
place their work in the broader context of the widespread social, economic and
political reformulations of British identity of the period.

_ Course Requirements:

_Papers_ : Each participant will write a seminar length (approximately 25
pages) research paper that uses original research to cast light on the central
texts and issues raised in the course. I encourage you to begin work on these
projects as early as possible in the term so that you will have the time
necessary to develop your ideas, focus your research, and hone your arguments.
The paper will be due on Wednesday, May 13 at noon in my box in EPB 310.

_Research Discussions_ : The final meeting of the class will be devoted to
presentation of your research projects. Each of you will be alotted
approximately fifteen minutes to provide the class with an overview of your
work and a series of questions that will stimulate feedback from participants
in the seminar.

_Presentations_ : Each student will be responsible for a presentation that
focuses on one of the texts under discussion for a particular class meeting.
These presentations may offer an overview of the text, attempt to situate the
text in relation to other important issues under consideration in the class,
and/or interrogate the central assumptions of the text. Since these
presentations are primarily designed to initiate discussion for each class,
presenters should remain focused exclusively on the materials under discussion
in class. To help integrate presentations into class discussion, presenters
will be expected to post a one-page abstract of their presentation on the
course website no later than noon of the day of their presentation. Students
will be expected to have consulted the web site before each class in order to
develop their own responses and questions to each presentation. Presentations
should last no longer than 10 minutes.

_Responses_ : One student will be paired with each presenter to give a
response to the presentation for the day. These responses are primarily
designed to focus class discussion on the most significant questions and
concerns brought to light by each presenter. Since the respondent's task will
be to suggest a series of avenues for class exploration, respondents should
obviously consult with presenters in advance. Responses should be limited to 5
minutes maximum.

### Course Objectives

The study of distributed systems is exciting and interesting! In many
respects, distributed systems are at the forefront of a revolution in the
computer science discipline. In this course we will explore the principles and
paradigms that are associated with distributed systems. During our exploration
of _principles_ , we will focus on developing a working understanding of the
notions and concepts that are fundamental to all distributed systems. During
our investigation of _paradigms_ , we will examine, in great depth, a specific
technology for building distributed systems. To this end, we will focus on the
specification, design, and implementation of distributed systems that utilize
the Java programming language, the Jini network technology, and the JavaSpaces
object repository.

### Performance Objectives

At the completion of this class, a student should be aware of the challenges
and complexities that are associated with distributed systems. A student
should be familiar with the concepts that are associated with the fundamentals
of distributed systems. Moreover, a student should have developed a toolkit of
tools, techniques, and methodologies that can be applied to the creation of
distributed systems. The student should be comfortable with the development of
distributed systems using Java, Jini, and JavaSpaces. Finally, a student
should develop a basic understanding of some of the current research and the
open research questions in the field of distributed systems. After completing
this course, a student should be equipped for further graduate study in the
field of distributed systems.

### Required Text Information

Andrew S. Tanenbaum. _Distributed Systems: Principles and Paradigms_

This required text presents a broad and basic coverage of the principles and
paradigms that are associated with distributed systems. Initially, the text
introduces the common principles that are commonly associated with all
distributed systems technologies. The broad issues that are related to topics
like naming, synchronization, consistency, replication, and fault tolerance
are discussed. These "principle" chapters have brief forays into specific
examples; however, they attempt to present the fundamental principles of
distributed systems without straying into specific distributed system
technologies. The second section of the textbook deals with specific
distributed system paradigms. These paradigms include distributed object-based
systems, distributed file systems, document-based systems, and coordination-
based systems. Overall, the text is a well-written and well-organized
introduction to the notion of a distributed system!

### Additional Text Information

The required text will be supplemented with with excerpts from a number of
different sources. Articles from important computer science and software
magazines, such as _Communications of the ACM_ , _IEEE Software_ , _IEEE
Computer_ , and _IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering_ , will be examined
to expand and deepen the scope of the required material. Technical reports
that have been submitted to the [Networked Computer Science Technical Report
Library (NCSTRL)](http://www.ncstrl.org) could also be used as additional
texts. Finally, papers that are found in the [ Computer Science Research
Index](http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/cs) will also be used throughout the
semester. Finally, chapters taken other books from distributed systems
discipline could be examined during the semester. Candidate books might
include, but are not limited to, the following titles.

### Grading Policies

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on class
participation, grades on two interim exams, the grade on the final exam, the
grade for all homework assignments and laboratories, and the grade for the
final project. The grade breakdown will follow the form below. It is possible
for the assigned percentages to change if a need to do so presents itself.

_These percentages have been revised from the initial ones that were provided
in the syllabus. These revisions were made due to differences between expected
class schedule and the actual class schedule._ Class Participation| 5%  
---|---  
First Exam| 10%  
Second Exam (cancelled)| 0%  
Final Exam| 20%  
Homework| 20%  
Laboratories| 25%  
Final Project| 20%  
  
### Laboratory Assignments

Laboratory assignments will require students to investigate different facets
of the specification, design, and implementation of distributed systems. All
laboratories will require the usage of provided tools to write Java
applications that solve real-world problems in a distributed fashion.
Laboratory assignments are intended to be conducted in an independent fashion.
Each laboratory assignment will be provided on the laboratory listing the day
before our scheduled laboratory session. Students are expected to read the
laboratory before attending the session in order to prepare themselves
appropriately. Each laboratory assignment will be due at the beginning of the
next laboratory session, unless otherwise noted. All laboratory assignments
will require the students to checkout code and applications from the
Department's CVS server. Furthermore, a collaborative version of each
laboratory assignment will be placed on the WikiWeb. Students are encouraged
to post questions and high-level discussions on this collaborative version.

### Homework Assignments

The reading assignment for many chapters of the required text will be coupled
with excerpts from the additional texts. Questions that examine the additional
texts in detail will be assigned as homework problems. Instead of submitting
question responses on sheets of paper in class, students will utilize the
Homework WikiWeb. Each student will post their answers to the assigned
questions and will be encouraged to tailor their answers based upon the
responses that have already been posted. These responses to the assigned
articles will help us to collaboratively produce a forum that demonstrates the
evolution of the understanding of distributed systems that the class is
developing. Students will be graded on the quality of their response and the
interplay of their response with other responses.

### Final Project

Throughout the semester, you will experiment with different technologies that
allow for the creation of distributed systems. However, an important component
in a course that analyzes distributed systems is a project of a larger scope.
The final project will require you to draw upon all of the knowledge and
skills that you have developed during the semester. The final project in this
class will be completed in groups whose sizes will be commensurate with the
number of people in the class. Each group will be responsible for the creation
of the requirements and design for a software system that solves a real-world
problem. Furthermore, the groups will be responsible for the implementation
and testing of their distributed application. This project will allow students
to gain practical experience with the tools of a distributed systems developer
while helping them to gain exposure to a wide range of new technologies.
Students will be required to collaborate through the usage of the
[WikiWeb](http://cs.allegheny.edu:8080/cs4902002/2).

### Class Attendance and Preparation

The study of the computer science discipline is very challenging. Students in
this class will be challenged to learn the principles of distributed systems
and hone their problem solving skills while also learning about new
distributed system development technologies. During the coming semester even
the most diligent student will experience times of frustration when they are
attempting to understand a challenging concept or complete a difficult
laboratory assignment. In many situations some of the material that we examine
will initially be confusing : do not despair! Press on and persevere!

In order to minimize confusion, students must invest time to prepare for class
discussions and lectures. During our class periods, the Instructor will often
pose demanding questions that could require group consultation, the creation
of a Java program, or a vote on a questionable issue. Only students that have
prepared for class by reading the assigned material and reviewing the
laboratory and homework assignments will be able to effectively participate in
these discussions. More importantly, only prepared students will be able to
extract the knowledge needed to be successful in this introduction to the
computer science discipline. Therefore, it is **mandatory` for all students to
attend class sessions. In order to help students to remain organized and
effectively prepare for classes, a [class
schedule](http://cs.allegheny.edu:8080/cs4902002/3) will be maintained with
reading assignments and the main focal point for given periods of time.
Remember this motto, _semper paratus_!

### Laboratory Attendance Policy

In order to explore the discipline of computer science, it is essential for
students to have hands-on experience with the tools of the trade. Therefore,
it is **mandatory** for all students to attend laboratory sessions. All
laboratory sessions will be conducted in an individual manner. Attendance will
be taken at the beginning of each laboratory session and missing students will
be noted. If you will not be able to attend a laboratory, please see the
Instructor at least one week in advance to describe your situation. Of course,
documented emergencies will also be taken into account.

### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described on pages eight and nine of the Allegheny Course
Catalog. The Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic
credit or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.
This includes all work done in class (such as examinations, quizzes, and
laboratory work), all papers, and any other material that might be assigned in
this class. _All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the
Honor Program_. Each student who has matriculated at Allegheny College has
acknowledged the following pledge:

_I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in
the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College
community as a whole._

In this course, students are encouraged to conduct _high-level_ discussions
concerning the laboratories with their fellow classmates. It will be
considered a violation of the honor code for students to share segments of
source code on the laboratory assignments. Furthermore, it will be considered
a violation of the honor code if students that are not in the same group
collaborate on the final project. If a student is experiencing difficulties
with the low-level details of a laboratory, they are encouraged to seek help
from the Instructor. In the same respect, students who are having trouble with
the final project should also seek aid from the Instructor or their group
members. Students are encouraged (even required) to collaborate on the
homework assignments. The Instructor reserves the right to use several
different automated tools that scan Java source code to check for plagiarism
violations. Furthermore, the Instructor reserves the right to use different
automated tools to scan written responses to homework assignments for
plagiarism violations.

![Landing at Danang](danang.gif)_Course Description:_ This course is a study
of the United States' participation in the Vietnam War. The course covers the
origins, events, and consequences of the war from 1945 to 1975. Special
emphasis will be given to the causes of American involvement in the war and
the reasons for the failure of American policy in Vietnam.  
  

_Textbooks and Required Readings:_ Students are required to read the following
books:  

George Donelson Moss, _Vietnam: An American Ordeal_ , 2d ed. (Englewood
Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice-Hall, 1994)  

Robert J. McMahon, ed., _Major Problems in the History of the Vietnam War:
Documents and Essays_ , 2d ed. (Lexington, Mass.: D. C. Heath and Company,
l995)  

Harry G. Summers, Jr., _On Strategy: A Critical Analysis of the Vietnam War_
(Novato, Calif.: Presidio Press, 1982; paperback ed., New York: Dell
Publishing, 1984)  

Terry H. Anderson, _The Movement and the Sixties: Protest in America From
Greensboro to Wounded Knee_ (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996)  

  
![Student Protests at Columbia University](columbia.gif) The professor may,
from time to time, assign additional readings to supplement the required books
listed above.  
  

_Course Objectives:_ Students will be able to identify and discuss the factors
which contributed to the United States' participation in the Vietnam War, the
major events of the war, the reasons for the failure of American policy in
Vietnam, and the long-term consequences of the war on American society and the
international community.

_Requirements of the Course  
_

_Exams:_ All exams will be essay exams. Three exams will be given during the
course of the semester. Each of these exams will cover about one-third of the
course material and each will count for 25 percent of the student's final
grade. The exams have been tentatively scheduled for June 6, June 18, and June
30. On exam days, the class will be divided into two periods. During the first
period (roughly 30-40 minutes), we will have a regular class lecture and
discussion session. During the second period (roughly 50-60 minutes), the exam
will be given.  

![Lyndon Johnson and Vietnam](johnson.gif)_Analysis of the Vietnam War:_
Students will write an extended analysis of either the causes of the United
States' involvement in the Vietnam War or the reasons for the failure of
American policy in Vietnam. This written analysis will be based on each
student's interpretation of the materials presented in the required readings
and in additional materials provided by the professor or gathered by the
student. While there is no maximum or minimum length required for the
analyses, papers of 10-12 pages are ideal. The analysis paper will be due on
June 29 and will count for 25 percent of the student's final grade. More
detailed instructions about the writing of the analysis will be given later.  

_Make-Up Assignments:_ Students will be allowed to make up missed assignments
only with the consent of the professor. Ordinarily, the professor will accept
make-up assignments only in cases of unavoidable student absences, such as
those caused by illness or by a death in the immediate family. Students may be
required to document the causes of their absences before the make-up work will
be accepted by the professor.  

_Course Outline:_ See the schedule below.  

_Grading and Evaluation of Students:_ The following grading scale will be used
in this course: A 90.0-100.0; B 80.0-89.9; C 70.0-79.9; D 60.0-69.9; F 59.9
and below. Final semester grades for the course will be determined by counting
the course assignments and exams in the following proportions: exam 1-25
percent; exam 2-25 percent; exam 3-25 percent; analysis of the Vietnam War-25
percent.  
  

_Attendance:_ Class attendance will be checked in every class period. At the
end of the semester, class attendance will be used in calculating the final
semester grade.  

![Nixon and Kissinger](nixon.gif) Attendance records will be used to determine
the final grade of students who are on the borderline between two grades
(i.e., students who are within one semester point of the higher grade). In the
case of a student who is on the borderline between two grades, the student
with 0-1 unexcused absences will receive the higher of the two grades.

Students with 4 or more unexcused absences will receive the following
penalties: 4-5 absences-minus one letter grade from semester average; 6-7
unexcused absences-minus two letter grades from semester average; 8 or more
unexcused absences-the grade of F for the semester.

Students who fall into the penalty range will have the option of doing an
extra assignment to remove the penalty. The assignment will be a term paper,
the length of which will be determined by the number of absences in class: 4
absences-5 pages; 5 absences-10 pages; 6 absences-15 pages; 7 absences-20
pages; 8 or more absences-25 pages. The term paper must be of C or better
quality to remove the penalty. Students who exercise this option must see the
professor in advance to obtain approval of their term paper topic and
instructions for completing their papers.  

![Vietcong Guerrilla](vietcong.gif)The following constitute excused absences:
(1) illness, with a note from a doctor or the dean; (2) death in the immediate
family, with a note from the dean; (3) required appearance in a court of law,
with a note from the dean; (4) representing the college in an extracurricular
activity, with a note from the faculty or administrative adviser of the
activity and the prior approval of the professor of this course.

Please note that some college extracurricular activities do not justify an
excused absence, so prior approval of the absence by the professor is
required. __Athletes who plan to miss class for a game must notify the
professor before each absence to receive an excused absence.__ Students who
plan to miss class for such activities as work, job interviews, job fairs,
weddings, vacations, completing work for other courses, etc., should save
their cuts for these purposes.

__Students who arrive late to a session of the class should check with the
professor at the end of that class session to be certain that their attendance
has been recorded.__ Students who arrive excessively late to a class period or
who leave class early will receive only partial credit for their attendance
that day.  

_Auditors:_ Students who are auditing the course will receive an audit credit
only if they have 4 or fewer absences in the class.  
  

_Schedule:_ The following tentative schedule should be used as a guide for the
completion of assignments and readings. Assigned readings should be completed
by the class date listed in the left column.

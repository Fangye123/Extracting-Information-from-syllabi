** In this course, we conduct a systematic topical and regional survey of the
world's seven major areas. Combining textbook readings, videos, slides, and
discussions, students gain an appreciation of regional cultural diversity and
an understanding of the dynamics of the emerging global economy. As part of
the course structure, we will debate key issues and problems relevant to
contemporary society in each of the world's regions.

This is an exciting and stimulating course that will broaden your knowledge
and understanding of your individual role in the world and of relationships
between different societies and countries. You must come to class ready to
learn and to challenge ideas.

****** This course is part of the Core program in Geography. GEOG 110 also
satisfies the Category F World Cultures requirement for General Education
credit.

**Basic Rules and Requirements**

******* Students are strongly encouraged to use the research material
generated in this course as part of their Senior Assessment Portfolio. Part of
the University's Academic Improvement strategy requires that Seniors be
assessed before graduation on the general principles gained from their major
program of study. The Geography Department REQUIRES that you develop a
portfolio containing your research papers, skill course outputs, and other
material relevant to your program of study. See your major advisor for more
information about Senior Assessment.

** Please make every effort to come to class on time. The class ends at 1015
am, so do not begin packing up materials until the appropriate time as it
disturbs other students and is rude behavior. Those students who attend
regularly generally get more from the course than students who miss class.
Unexcused absences always affect the final grade negatively (for example, more
than four unexcused will lower your grade by one letter, and more than 8
unexcused absences will merit an "F" for the course). Attendance and
participation policies for scheduled Fridays are no different from other
scheduled meetings. All papers, assignments, and other materials must be
completed ON TIME in order to pass the course. Respect in the classroom for
your fellow student is expected. Inappropriate behavior such as talking while
the lecture is in progress, reading the newspaper while the lecture is in
progress, or other disruptions to the learning environment are NOT tolerated.
Students who violate these basic rules of respect will be expelled from the
course and will receive an "F" for the course.

** This course requires a commitment of 5 hours class time plus 10 hours of
outside reading and research every two weeks.

** I have a zero tolerance for cheating of any kind. Any type of academically
and ethically dishonest work (plaguarism, copying someone else's work, etc.)
will result in an automatic "F" for the course and notification of the
appropriate academic authority.

** NOTE: The Department of Geography & Geology strictly adheres to the course
drop policy found in the Undergraduate and Graduate catalogs. It is the sole
responsibility of individual students to meet the cited deadlines for dropping
a course. In exceptional cases the deadline for schedule changes (dropping a
course) may be waived. The successful waiver will require a written
description of extenuating circumstances and relevant documentation. Poor
academic performance, general malaise, or undocumented general stress factors
are NOT considered legitimate extenuating circumstances. Since the granting of
such waivers is rare, we urge you to follow the established guidelines.

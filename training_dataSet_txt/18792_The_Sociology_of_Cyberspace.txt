The Sociology of Cyberspace (SOC 391) is a collaborative project with
coordinating professors from a variety of disciplines including sociology,
physics, philosophy, business, art, English, women's studies, and computer
science. The class was first taught by faculty and students at Bradley
University during the Spring 1995 semester.  The Sociology of
Cyberspace examines the contemporary revolution in human interaction via
computer. Using both postmodern and traditional media theory, we will discuss
the social construction of the virtual world and new virtual communities
with emphasis on the new culture, institutions and norms in the experience
of cyberspace. Topics include: new concepts of space, time, and order;
electronic subjectivity and anonymity; new representation of gender, race
and class; emergence of new languages of expression; and the revolutionary
impact of hypertext and multimedia technologies on human thinking and learning.

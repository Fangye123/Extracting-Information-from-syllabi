**PURPOSE AND COURSE OBJECTIVES**

**The purpose of this course is to explore age-related changes in motor
behavior, skill performance, perceptual-motor abilities, and physical fitness.
Persons who are interested in motor behavior as it relates to kinesiology,
physical education, developmental psychology, elementary education, early
childhood education, special education, and gerontology should find this
course instructive.  Current and potential parents and grandparents will also
find the course relevant.**

**Upon completing the course, you should have developed the following
competencies:**

  * **the ability to formulate a developmental perspective, especially from a life span viewpoint**
  * **knowledge of changing motor behavior across the life span**
  * **knowledge of the factors affecting motor development, including physical growth and physiological change, perceptual change, and socio-cultural practices**
  * **the ability to apply motor development knowledge**

**Specific, detailed course objectives have been developed for each unit.**

**![Top of Page](uparrow.gif)**







**PREREQUISITES**

**The prerequisites for this course are junior or senior level standing and
completion of the University's general education requirements (see pp. 46 & 47
in the catalog).  This is an introductory motor development course, so
background knowledge in Kinesiology, although helpful, is not necessary.**

**Deadlines:** **COMPLETING THE COURSE**

**For over 25 years this course has been a self-paced course.   It is not a
self-paced course this semester.  There are firm deadlines for completing each
unit.  The first time you miss a deadline, you will receive a warning.  You
will then be given three additional days to complete that unit and catch up
for the next unit.  For example, if you missed the September 19th deadline for
Unit Two, you would have until 5:00pm on September 22nd to catch up.  If you
fail to complete the unit within the three days grace period, you will be
required to drop the course.  If, after missing one deadline and catching up,
you fail to meet another deadline, you will be required to drop the course.
[This is sort of two strikes and you're out.]  If you do not drop the course,
you will receive an "F" grade regardless of how much work you have completed
up to that date.  Failure to complete the entire course within the semester
will also result in an "F" grade regardless of how many points you have
acquired.  As always, you may complete the course at a rate _faster_ than the
deadline dates below.   If you have any questions about this policy, please
contact me.**

**FINAL EXAMINATION**

**The final examination in Motor Development is a comprehensive essay test.
**

**When you have completed all of the other course requirements, send the
instructor an e-mail indicating that you are ready to take the final
examination.   The instructor will send your exam by e-mail.  Answer the
questions and return to the instructor for grading.  As with the chapter
quizzes and tests, you may use your textbook and other materials to help you
answer the questions.   You may not collaborate with current or former Motor
Development students, however.   (See section on Scholastic Dishonesty.)  At
the time of the final examination, you will also be requested to fill out a
course evaluation form.  Your feedback is valuable; it helps to improve the
course for students who follow.  **

  **![Top of Page](uparrow.gif)**  







**SCHOLASTIC DISHONESTY**

**  
Since this is an Internet course, there are many opportunities to cheat.   You
could copy someone else's quiz answers, you could use someone else's essay
question answers, and you could copy someone else's lab assignments.  Every
semester I catch some students who turn in work that is another student's.
Sometimes a current student shares work; sometimes it is a former student.
Cheating is such a fashion is scholastic dishonesty.  The penalty for cheating
in this course is that you will receive an F in the course.  I have no
tolerance for such behavior.  A word to the wise - Don't test me.   **

**Scholastic dishonesty is described in _UTPB's 1999-2000 Student Guide_
(pages 16-22).   A copy of  
the _Student Guide_ may be obtained from the Office of Student Life on the
first floor of the Mesa Building (room 154).   Examples of scholastic
dishonesty are: (1) copying the answers to another student's quiz or essay
test and submitting all or part of it as if it were your own (cheating); (2)
obtaining any other person's work and submitting all or part of it as if it
were your own (plagiarism); (3) collaborating with another person in preparing
a test or a laboratory assignment (cheating).  **

**Collaboration on the laboratory assignments is permissible for the data
collection stage ****only.   Analyzing the data and answering the discussion
questions must be done independently.  For a more detailed explanation of
scholastic dishonesty as it relates to laboratory assignments, see the
[Laboratory
Assignments](http://www.utpb.edu/courses/kine3310/lab.htm#SCHOLASTIC
DISHONESTY) section under Unit One. **

**In this course, you may use your textbook to help you answer quiz, test, and
final examination questions; using your textbook is NOT scholastic dishonesty.
**

**Scholastic dishonesty will result in a grade of "F" in the course.   **

**COMPUTER SURVIVAL SKILLS**

**There are two general ways to access KINE 3310: (1) from a computer at UT
Permian Basin; and (2) from a remote site off-campus (i.e., home).  
  
1.   From a remote site, you'll need a computer with a fairly fast modem, Internet access, an Internet browser, and e-mail.  The information you need to make sure you have the right computer hardware and software is located at the [REACH](http://www.utpb.edu/REACH/index.htm) site.  As mentioned at the top of the Syllabus page, you really need to read all of the information contained at each of the following locations in order to reduce computer-use frustration:**

> **](http://www.utpb.edu/REACH/WChelp/wcinfo.htm)

**2.   From UTPB there are two locations where computers are available to you,
and from which you may access this course:**

> **(A) The John Ben Sheppard Learning Lab is located in the 2nd floor
library.   If you need help, the person at the library reference desk will get
you started.  
>  
>  (B) The Information Resources Division is located on the second floor, room
262. [You may also use computers in rooms 262F (PC computers) or 262J (Mac
computers) when no classes are being conducted.]  If you need help, a student
assistant or staff person in 262C will get you started.  
>  **

**Once situated, do the following:  
  
Click on the program manager icon.  
**

> **(A) If you're in the John Ben Sheppard Learning Lab, click on the Netscape
Navigator icon.   At this point the UTPB Library homepage will appear. Scroll
down the screen until you see "Back to UTPB Homepage" in blue; click on it and
UTPB's homepage will appear.  
>  
>  (B) If you're in the Information Resources Division, click on the Internet
Browser Viewer icon, then click on the Netscape Navigator icon.    At this
point, UTPB's homepage will appear.  
>  **

**Now at UTPB's homepage, click on "Online Courses."**  **That will take you
to the REACH (Distance Learning) website.   Click on the Web Courses for this
semester there in the left hand column.   Scroll down and click on "KINE 3310"
to go to the Motor Development Home Page.  Click on

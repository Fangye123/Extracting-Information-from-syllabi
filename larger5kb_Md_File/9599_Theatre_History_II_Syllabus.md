**COURSE OBJECTIVES** :

To examine the development of Western mainstream theatre from the Restoration
1750 through thebeginning of Modernism in relation to culture & society; to
explore significant departures from and complements to the mainstream as well
as other compelling theatre traditions, particularly those of Asia, Indonesia
& Africa; to synthesize and correlate classroom work with ongoing observation
of historical influences in contemporary theatre; to develop familiarity with
the particular artists, producers and theatres who are currently interpreting,
rejecting or reinventing theatre history.  


**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**Required Texts** :

**_The Living Theater: A History_** , Wilson & Goldfarb,  **Third** edition

**_Bedford Intro to Drama_** , Jacobson, 4th ed.,

**_The New York Times_ Sunday** **Arts & Entertainment**, every week; hard
copy or on-line (to which you can subscribe for free).

**Highly recommended:**

**_Longman's Handbook_**  


**Required Show**

Your choice. (See below) Must be professionally produced. If money is an
issue, please **make arrangements early** to usher and go free or to find out
about Student rush possibilities at NY and other theaters.  


**READINGS:**

On day a play is listed students will hand in a  **completed play report** ,
typed. Late and missing papers will be graded zero. You'll notice there are
weeks when there is not much reading for the course but that the bulk of the
plays accumulate at the end of the semester, when Modernism comes in. Please
work ahead so you don't get swamped.  


**LECTURES**

**Vocabulary Sheets** will be provided usually with _more_ information than
you might need; it's there for your reference in case a topic is of particular
interest to you. As questions and comments come up from the class the order of
the lecture may detour from that presented in the vocabulary sheets. Refer to
the vocabulary  as needed as you listen. Try to avoid using the sheets as an
exercise in "fill-in-the-blanks". Be sure to see the forest as well as the
trees.  


**TESTS:**

There will be four quizzes (NO MAKEUP QUIZZES) and one final, cumulative exam.
Students may choose to do a Project (see below) instead of the final exam, at
discretion of instructor.

1.  **Attend a professional production** of a Western play (Restoration through 1920) or any Asian. Indonesian, African. or Native American performance at a professional Theatre (in NY, NJ or the state of your choice) or cultural center (e.g. Asia Society; Japan Society). 

**If you make arrangements early** \-- i.e., START NOW-- you should be able to
find free/cheap opportunities to catch a play, including ushering at local
theaters.

numbered, stapled (no paper clips).**  


For help with organizing/writing this, please take advantage of the Writing
Center. **Keep in mind that CONTENT and FORM are important. Consider carefully
how to STRUCTURE your ideas, how to SUPPORT them, how to PRESENT them.**  


**PROJECTS:** Optional.

A maximum of six projects will be approved. Each team can have 3-4 members.

Project includes a 15 minute, well-researched & organized presentation to the
class

and/or a web page design.

Powerpoint (or equivalent), visual and audio aids as well as hand-outs
strongly recommended.

Students or project groups who find it difficult to complete preliminary
assignments may be asked to withdraw from presenting and take the exam
instead.

witheach member contributing a minimum of three fully annotated sources.

**FIRST PROJECT ASSIGNMENT THUR. 2/7**

**Each group will**

**Break down its topic** into manageable parts (e.g. "Modern Dance Pioneers:
Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, Katherine Dunham, Doris Humphrey")

Each group hands in ONE TYPED PROPOSAL for their presentation, listing

TOPIC and

DIVISION OF LABOR and

Any QUESTIONS you are most interested in pursuing,

Possible SOURCES (e,g, interviews, live production; theater journals, etc.)
and

Anticipated CHALLENGES.  


**SECOND PROJECT ASSIGNMENT Thur. 2/14**

Each INDIVIDUAL in the group prepares a  **detailed,typed annotated
bibliography** -in-progress with at least THREE SOURCES that he/she expects to
use for her/his segment of the research.  


**THIRD PROJECT ASSIGNMENT Thur. 2/21**

Each INDIVIDUAL in the group prepares an updated DETAILED annotated
bibliography, with at least FIVE primary or secondary sources. (Please do not
cite class text-- this is a tertiary source.)  


**FOURTH PROJECT ASSIGNMENT As scheduled, 3/7 -- 4/30**

**Present** a vibrant presentation of material in a   **rehearsed , thought-
out manner,**

**TIMED to be between 15-18 minute  MAXIMUM**.

**Form AND Content** count. DO analyze and interpret information found. Do
synthesize. Do integrate your findings with what we are covering in class.
While music, props and costumes are appreciated also consider using visual
aids/handouts to be sure class can absorb the information (names, dates, etc.)
you are presenting.   **Any questions, please ask**!  


**Each member of group will**

**Will prepare** FINAL annotated bibliography listing EIGHT primary and
secondary sources.

**The papers and bibliographies of ALL members must be stapled or bound
together and handed in IN CLASS, AT START OF PRESENTATION.**  
    
    
  

**GRADES**

**To get an "A"** means   **your work could not be any better**.

It requires coming to class faithfully, prepared, participating fully and well
in discussions, completing all assignments in an exemplary manner while
sparing the instructor #%!&%# excuses.

**"Good" work** will get a **"B".** **"OK" work** rates a **"C".**

It's hard to get an **"F** " but skipping readings and discussions can get you
there

regardless of other grades. And, of course, not that I have to remind people
taking this course, but plagiarism of any kind can get you several floors
below zero.

About Plagiarism

When doing oral or written presentations be sure the work you present is your
own,

that sources are conscientiously cited in the body of your paper. Be wary
about cutting and pasting from Internet sources or relying too much on any one
or two sources.

Go easy on paraphrasing-- better to synthesize your research.

In the case of suspected plagiarism the burden of proof will be on the student

to provide evidence of original work, **so please  hold onto your notes,**
etc.

Plagiarism in any form can lead to suspension.

**Regarding E-mail, the Internet** & Computers in general:

No matter what the condition of your current computer and/or computer skills,
you must have an  **active e-mail account** that you check  **daily** for
notices regarding this class.

When preparing assignments for this class ALWAYS do a backup copy, right from
the start. Save material on THE NETWORK, as well as your hard driv

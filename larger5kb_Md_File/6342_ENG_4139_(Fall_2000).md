#### Course description

We will investigate the figure of the "network" (the matrix, the trellis, the
skein, the web, etc.) as a scheme for representing the technical, cultural,
and political-economic fields of the digital sign. What accounts for the near-
ubiquity of this figure in the popular discourses of new media? What social
and political-economic forms does it presuppose? What models of cognition and
knowledge does it favor? What aesthetic and artistic practices does it
engender? Our discussions will include historical investigation of selected
instances of this figure (e.g., scholastic mnemonic devices, early modern
cartography, diagrammatic representations of memory and learning from
cognitive science and artificial intelligence), but the course will focus
primarily on instances of the "network" in computer-based practices of
writing, representation, and exchange.

Course requirements include: a take-home midterm exam and a final research
paper. This class will make regular use of the
[NWE](http://web.nwe.ufl.edu/writing/) and other new media facilities in the
College of Liberal Arts and Sciences. Students should have at least a basic
familiarity with new media tools and environments (the WWW, standalone
multimedia, computer games, etc.)

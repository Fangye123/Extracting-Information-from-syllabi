**Content** :

> This course, dubbed "Advanced Evil" by the students, deals with the
existence of both evil and good. These phenomena can be approached textually,
philosophically, and literarily. However, the question remains: how do people
actually reach moral judgements. The evidence from the social sciences and
contemporary history is accumulating on this question and this course will
attempt to confront that evidence.

>  
> First, we will examine the nature of social conformity (obedience). Then, we
will turn to the phenomenon of moral resistance (disobedience) with emphasis
on altruistic studies. Then, we will study a field theory to answer the
question, what inclines people to do evil and good. Finally, we will ask, what
have we learned from the social sciences and history that can help us better
teach and act as good people.

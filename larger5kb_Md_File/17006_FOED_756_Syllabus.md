**Program Model**

The teacher education program at Middle Tennessee State University uses the
model: _The_ Teacher As A Reflective Decision-Maker. This means that you must
begin to incorporate all that you have learned in your general education
courses and the professional education courses and begin to see how they help
you make reasonable and good judgments. Each time you make a decision, it
should be done thoughtfully and reflected upon. As you learn about learning
theories you should reflect upon how the information can make you a more
effective teacher and how the knowledges and skills can improve the learning
of your students.

**Course Synopsis**

This course helps one to better understand the adult learner physically,
socially, emotionally, and mentally. Learning theories and learning styles
should influence how the teacher plans for learning and guides the learning of
the student.

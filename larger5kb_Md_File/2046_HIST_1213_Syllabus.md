## Course Philosophy

  * A review of the course objectives indicated that they could be completed in an asynchronous environment at the convenience of the student. 
  * This course gives a great deal of flexibility to each student by allowing him/her to (1) access the course at any time of the day or night, (2) from any place, and (3) at his/her own pace (within the deadlines listed on the Course Schedule). 
  * There is no such thing as a dumb question, except the one that is not asked. If you do not ask, you will not get an answer. 
  * An important aspect of this on-line course is the collaborative nature of learning. Each student will be expected to share his/her opinions with others and actively participate in all discussions. The responsibility for learning lies with the student. 
  * The instructors in this course will act as a resource and facilitators for learning. 
  * Students never-ever learn from technology. They learn from competent instructors who communicate effectively through the technology. Technology is always the servant, instructors are always the masters, and both should be led by student learning. 
  * Research informs us that students learn as well, as fast, and as much through technologies in distance learning environments as in traditional teaching environments. 

## Course Ground Rules

  * Learn how to use the LearningSpace immediately.[ ](http://homebrew.cs.ubc.ca:8900/SCRIPT/learner/scripts/serve_home)
  * There are deadlines for submission and completion of the assignments and exams. 
  * If you experience technical problems, solve them immediately; do not wait until you are hopelessly behind. 
  * The instructors in this course will act as a resource and facilitators for learning. Take advantage of their expertise. 
  * You will be expected to communicate with other students in the course via Discussion postings and comments. 
  * All course related e-mail should be sent through HIST 1213 course e-mail. 
  * Course [netiquette](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) should be observed during all online course communication. 
  * Each student should report any problems with URL links to (a) instructors, via HIST 1213 e-mail and (b) to students via Discussion postings. 
  * You are also encouraged to contribute any information, expertise, or insight that you can to the Discussions section of this course.

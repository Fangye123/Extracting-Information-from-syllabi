**Overview**     This course provides insight into contemporary research in
racial and ethnic relations.  This topic is massive, encompassing a number of
topics, theoretical perspectives, and contexts.  This quarter, we will focus
on two facets of racial & ethnic inequality within the U.S. context --
attitudes towards public policies to reduce inequality, and wealth as an
important dimension of racial/ethnic inequality.  Within this framework, you
will pursue your own research paper on related topics to meet the goals of a
writing proficiency course.  These goals include the opportunity to improve
writing and communication skills through: (1) the assignment of course grades
based primarily on writing; and (2) the opportunity to receive feedback on
multiple iterations of written work before final grades are assigned. We will
meet these goals by employing a variety of mechanisms throughout the quarter.
Most of these will center on the production of a substantial (12-15 page)
research paper by the end of the quarter, as described below.  Note that this
course has an introductory sociology prerequisite; this need not be in the
area of race and ethnic relations, however.

**Course Expectations and Responsibilities**     I expect this class to be
among your top priorities for the term.  Sometimes other legitimate concerns
such as employment cause us to reshuffle our priorities, including coursework.
Though I am sympathetic to these responsibilities, the consequences may be
that your performance (and grade) in this class may suffer if these other
concerns interfere with the work required here.  Competing demands are one of
the realities of adult life.  In sum, if your other responsibilities interfere
with your ability to complete assignments or attend class regularly, you
should not expect to receive extensions or a high grade _irrespective of the
legitimacy of your other priorities._

**Illness, Emergencies, and other Difficulties**  
    If short term, non-emergency illnesses or other contingencies create problems with completing assignments on time or taking an exam, you **must** notify me before the exam or due date **and** provide documentation thereafter of your situation.   Either e-mail me or leave a message at the phone number above with your name, the nature of your problem, and a _phone number_ where you can be reached with my decision.   You need not reach me directly, but a message is required.  I will only consider an extension or make-up if I receive notification prior to exams or deadlines.  Only in the case of a _documented emergency_ will this policy be waived.   I do not make my lecture notes available _under any circumstances_ \-- students will need to get notes from other classmates in case of absence. **Note that all assignments are due at the beginning of class.**   
   In the event of major difficulties such as debilitating illness or death in
the family that may interfere with coursework, students should contact Student
Support Services, OM 110, 650-3844.  They will notify your instructors of the
problem, in turn, and I will make arrangements for missed work at that point.
Note that if a serious difficulty arises, the best solution may be to withdraw
from the course or take a temporary leave from the university.

**Classroom Etiquette**  
    Please do not engage in any behaviors which distract me or other students during class, including chatting, arriving late to class and leaving early. Students must turn off cellular phones/pagers before class begins!

**Attendance and Participation**  
    Once paper topics are selected, students will be assigned to small workshop groups organized around topical themes.  During class throughout the quarter, these groups will meet so that students can provide feedback to each other.  Each workshop will precede a due date as indicated on the course schedule, and preliminary assignments and feedback on others' preliminary assignments will comprise part of the "class activities" portion of the final grade.  As members and citizens of the scholarly community, therefore, attendance, preparation of preliminary assignments, and participation are _mandatory_ for these days.   
    Various other short assignments, quizzes, and other activities will be completed in class throughout the term as well.  These will require preparation (careful reading and annotation of assigned readings, timely completion of preliminary writing assignments) and, of course, regular attendance.

**Exams**  
    The two exams (midterm and final) will be taken in class and will test familiarity with key terms and concepts taken from course readings and/or reviewed in class.

**Research Paper**  
    To meet the provisions of a WP course, students will complete a substantial research paper (12-15 pages) on a topic related to course content.  Incremental assignments that build to completion of the paper are listed below.  Suggested topics may be drawn from these two broad areas:

  * Some aspect of racial inequality not covered here, e.g., in the criminal justice system; in political representation, with regard to one or more racial/ethnic minorities.  Or application of perspectives on wealth inequality to some minority other than African Americans.
  * The application of one or more of the theoretical perspectives on public opinion surveyed here to some other minority group (as holders of public opinion _or_ as targets of policy opinions by the majority).

The paper will be constructed as the "front end" of a research project, with
an introduction, theoretical review, review of existing research, and a
statement of research questions and/or hypotheses.  Pay attention to assigned
chapters in _Racialized Politics_ as prototypes of this format.   Details on
each of the component assignments will be forthcoming.

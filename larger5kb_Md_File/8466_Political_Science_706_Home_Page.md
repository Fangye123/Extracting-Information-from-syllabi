# Political Science 706: Research Methods I -- Fall 2000

### Philip A. Schrodt  
Department of Political Science  
University of Kansas

## Course Description:

This is the foundation course for students in the M.A. and Ph.D. programs in
political science at the University of Kansas. The course serves three
purposes:

1) It is an introduction to many of the formal research methods commonly found
in social science research and policy evaluation in Europe and North America.

2) It is an introduction to basic statistical techniques, resources and
concepts; these will be pursued in much greater depth in POLS 707.

3) It is an opportunity to develop skills in the presentation of research
findings, including standards for written research reports.

In addition to these issues, the course will cover an assortment of aspects of
graduate-level and professional political science. The course will not go into
much detail on the substance of political science-these topics are covered in
the 800-level survey courses-but examples of political behavior will be used
extensively to illustrate various points.

### [Syllabus for 2000](00.syll.00.html)

This version of the syllabus was automatically converted to HTML by MS-Word
and is a bit rough, but the dates and deadlines are correct.

### [Syllabus from 1999](00.syll.99.html)

If you are browsing this site just to get an idea of the course content, look
at this one -- it is better formated and easier to read. The Fall 2000 class
will be similar to this.

## Links to Political Science Data

**Note:** Many of the data sets at the social science data centers at various
universities (Harvard, Yale, UCSD, etc) cannot be downloaded outside of those
institutions. In particular, you won't be able to get any ICPSR data sets from
those remote sites, but you _can_ get ICPSR data directly from KU -- see the
first link below. I've included these sites because they contain extensive
links to sites where data can be downloaded, and also have quite a bit of
documentation about statistic and statistical software.

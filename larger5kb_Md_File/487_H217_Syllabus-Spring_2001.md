_**Course Objectives**  
This course, which fulfills the second course writing requirement for Arts and
Sciences students, is designed to improve students' academic writing. It
emphasizes those skills which are of particular use to the student of history.
Students will also learn to utilize effectively the electronic resources
available for historical research at IPFW. Since all faculty in the Department
of History are invited to participate in this course, students will also have
the opportunity to interact with the faculty and learn about thier areas of
expertise.  
  
**Attendance Policy**  
Because success in this course is dependent upon the exchange of information
which occurs only in the classroom, regular attendance is necessary. A penalty
will be assessed for excessive absences. Five percent of the course grade will
be determined, as indicated below, on the basis of attendance: 0 absencesA+;
1-2 absencesA; 3-4 absencesB; 5-6 absencesC; 7-8 absencesD; 9 or more
absencesF.  
  
**Class Participation**  
While no specific grade is awarded for in-class participation, such
participation can be a factor in the determination of the course grade. Extra
credit can be earned for contributions to class discussions.

Department of History policy prohibits the use of recording devices in the
classroom unless there is a special need. Students with such needs should
consult the instructor. If you have or acquire a disability and would like to

semester.

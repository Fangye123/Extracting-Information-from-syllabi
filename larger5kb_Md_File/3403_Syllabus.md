The Russian Revolution was one of the great events of the twentieth century.
Not only did it transform life for millions living within the Russian Empire
and the revolutionary Soviet regime which replaced it after a bloody civil
war, but it also polarized politics and international relations for the rest
of the century. Taking a broad definition of "revolution," this course
examines various social, political, cultural and economic "revolutions" from
the late nineteenth century up to the Bolshevik consolidation of power in the
early 1920s. This period includes the liberal revolutions of 1905 and February
1917 which brought Russia the first and only democratic regime in its history
prior to 1991. The Bolshevik revolution is examined through the period of
Civil War to the final Bolshevik victory and the establishment of the Soviet
Union.

AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY PROCESS

_Course Purpose  
_

This course is designed to improve students' understanding of the processes
through which US foreign policy is made. First, the course explores
alternative models of the making of American foreign policy. Second, the
course examines the key institutions in the American foreign policy process,
including the Presidency, the Congress, the National Security Council, the
State Department, the Defense Department, the intelligence community, the
media, and the public and interest groups. Finally, the course uses case
studies to encourage students to apply their understanding of policy processes
and players to a wide variety of issue areas, including defense procurement,
arms control, the use of force, international trade and aid, alliance
politics, regional conflicts, and human rights.

  

_Course Requirements  
_

1) Readings  

I expect students to do the readings before class and to come to class
prepared to discuss and raise questions about them. The readings are heaviest
in the first part of the course, at about 100 pages a week for undergraduates
and 200 for graduates, and they drop to about 50 pages a week for everyone
after the mid-term as they concentrate on memos and papers.

2) Paper  

Students will write one research paper of approximately 4,000 words for
undergraduates and 7,000 words for graduate students. I strongly encourage
students to see me in office hours or by appointment to discuss paper topics,
sources, and research strategies. The best time for this is February, after we
have discussed models of the policy process but before the mid-term.  

3) Mid-Term Exam  

There will be a mid-term exam on March 6 on policy models, actors, and
institutions. There is no final exam.

4) Group Exercise  

I will divide students into groups that will work on the policy process cases
introduced in the last section of the class. I will assign each student to one
group, which will write a group memo on its assigned case and make a
presentation in class based on this memo.  

5) Brief Comments on Other Groups' Memos.  

I will require students to provide brief (about 100-150 words) commentaries on
the memos on four of the eight case topics other than that of their own group.
After grading these comments, I will give copies of the best ones, with their
authors' names removed, to the memo groups to provide additional feedback.  
  

_Grading Policy_ :  

Approximately 50 percent of the grade will depend on the paper, 25 percent
will depend on the mid-term, and 25 percent will depend on class
participation, including participation in class discussions, brief comments on
other groups' memos, and the writing and presentation of group memos. The
grading scale is:  

100 to 96 A

95 to 92 A-

91 to 88 B+

87 to 84 B

83 to 80 B-

79 to 76 C+

75 to 72 C

71 to 68 C-  
  

_Office Hours  
_

I encourage students to visit during office hours (listed on the front page of
the syllabus) or by appointment to discuss the course. I am also happy to
advise students on career and graduate school decisions (such as the fateful
law school vs. graduate school vs. jobs in government vs. real life dilemma).

_Paper Requirements and Suggestions  
  
_

Student papers should evaluate some aspect of the American foreign policy
process and its effect on substantive outcomes. Possible paper topics include:
1) an application of one of the policy process models covered in the first
three weeks of the course to the making of American foreign policy on a
particular issue at one or more stages of the policy process (problem
definition, formulation of options, choice among options, implementation); 2)
a comparison of the power of alternative policy process models in explaining
policy outcomes at one or more stages of the policy process; 3) an analysis of
the dynamics of an institution or organization involved in the foreign policy
process, or of the interaction between two or more organizations in this
process; or, 4) any other topic on the American foreign policy process that I
approve.  

One-paragraph paper topics are due for my review on March 6\. A one-page paper
outline is due April 1. Students are free to change topics for any reason
until April 15, provided that they receive my approval of their new topic and
outline. The paper itself is due May 5. Late papers will be marked down in
proportion to their lateness.  

Students might want to browse through current and back issues of the following
newspapers and journals to help them define a paper topic: _The New York
Times_ , _The Washington Post_ , _The National Journal_ , _Congressional
Quarterly_ , _Washington Quarterly_ , _Foreign Affairs_ , _Foreign Policy_ ,
_International Security_ , _World Politics_ , _American Political Science
Review_ , _Political Science Quarterly_ , _International Organization_ , and
_Presidential Studies Quarterly_.

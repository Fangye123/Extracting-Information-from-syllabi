**Tuesday 8 May Final Examination at 4:00 p.m.  
413 Waterman**

There are three 50-minute examinations and a final examination.

No makeup examinations or alternative dates for examinations. A (= one [1])
missed 50-minute examination may be excused, if a student presents a good
cause, in which case other components of the grade will be adjusted
proportionately.

There will be one research project (not paper), due 23 April, consisting of an
annotated bibliography and a thesis statement. The bibliography must contain
both primary and secondary sources and an assessment of those sources.
Preliminary drafts are strongly encouraged. Late projects cost five percentage
points per weekday (weekends free).

#### [Link](projects.html) to information on research projects

Final grade will be computed as follows: 20% for each examination (including
the final), 20% for the research project.

**Required Books:**

**Book package including,**  
**     Retrieving the American Past [listed as "RTAP"]**

**_Cosmetics, Fashions, and the Exploitation of Women_**  
**by Evelyn Reed, Joseph Hansen, Mary-Alice Waters**

******************************  
**Grading:**

**Your grade in this course will be based on your scores on three exams [which
may include essays and IDs], two during the semester, in weeks 6 and 11, and a
final exam**

**The first two tests will be worth 100 points each and the final will be
worth 150 points.**

**If you miss an exam due to verifiable emergency conditions, there will be
makeup tests given on a chosen date at the end of the semester, probably
during the week of May 2d-9th.   On that day, you will be required to make up
either or both of your missing tests. The only excuses for missing that day
will also be medical or other emergencies, for which you will provide written
documentation. If you miss the makeup test, you will receive zeroes for those
tests.**  


**N.B: NO EXTRA CREDIT WILL BE AVAILABLE; please do not ask!**

**Make sure you attend class regularly and keep up with the assigned readings.
If at any time you are unsure of the material we are covering, please ask the
T.A. or me.**

**********

**If, after we have turned back your exams, you have any questions or
complaints, this is the procedure to follow:**

**First, we will not discuss your tests right after we turn them back to you;
please look over your exams upon return and wait a day before contacting us.**

**Next, make an appointment with your TA and come to that meeting with
specific questions or concerns, _in writing_.   If you believe you deserved a
higher grade, be prepared to explain specifically why you believe that.  Do
not simply say "I studied and thought I should have done better."**

**Then, if the TA and you do not reach an agreement, the TA will re-grade the
entire test and your final grade may be raised, stay the same, or lowered.**

**If, at that point, you are still not satisfied, bring your exam to me, again
with specific questions or concerns in writing, and I will go over it with
you.**  
******************************  
**Academic Honesty:**

**You are expected to do your own work in this class. The tests will consist
of in-class essays and you will be expected to write your answers on your own.
If you have any questions about the University of Houston plagiarism policy,
please consult the University Handbook.**

**Also, there are now many websites covering various aspects of U.S. history.
Feel free to peruse them--many are quite useful--but do not turn in work from
the web as your own. We are all familiar with the various resources on the web
and will be able to notice any cases of turning in information from the web as
your own.**  
******************************  
**Classroom Decorum:**

**It goes without saying that you are expected to arrive in the classroom on
time, remain seated and quiet, and remain until the class ends.**

**Please turn off all pagers and cell phones before entering the auditorium.**

**Remember, this is a college course; you have decided to enrol and attend.
Therefore, if you are in class it is imperative that you remain silent for the
full fifty minutes that class is in session. If you decide to move about or
make noise, or otherwise disrupt your fellow students, university regulations
allow us to remove your name from the roster.    The TAs and I will be
vigilant in enforcing procedures on behavior.**

**Should problems arise, the class will be given a single warning.   If
disruptions persist after that, the professor reserves the right to take
appropriate measures.**  
******************************  
**E-Mail:**

**I have established an email discussion list for this class that is REQUIRED
of all students in History 1378.   You must subscribe yourself: send an email
to  hist1378-subscribe@yahoogroups.com .  You'll then receive a confirmation
and all you have to do it hit "reply" and you'll be good to go.**

**Once you are subscribed, I will use this email list to notify you about
tests, possible review sessions, and other similar things.   If you have a
question about class or about a reading, you may post it on the discussion
list.**

**Remember though: anything posted will go out to the entire class, so if you
have a personal question about a grade or something like that, sent it
directly to me or a TA at one of our personal email addresses!!!!**

**This list is to be used only as a way to disseminate class information or to
have email discussions about topics raised in class or in the readings [or in
some other way pertinent to the material we are studying].   Should students
abuse this list [posting class notes for everyone for instance], the professor
reserves the right to close the list down.**  
******************************  
**Lecture materials and notes:**

**I consider the lectures I deliver to be my intellectual property and no one
should post them on a web site or otherwise make them available publicly
without my permission.**

**THE RISE AND FALL OF THE U.S.S.R.**  
**History 222**

**Introduction**

The rise and fall of the USSR heavily influenced world history in the
twentieth century.  The United States in particular reacted strongly to the
Soviet Union's alternative competitive model for the future.  The fall of
communist political leadership in 1991 leads to a necessary reappraisal of
this region's Soviet past.  Russia and the newly independent states of the
former Soviet Union are transitional societies developing varied new models
for the future.  This part of the world remains critical in the evolution of
the twenty first century. Historical legacies from the Soviet period are
prominent in shaping the face of contemporary Russia, the independent states
of the former Soviet Union and western attitudes.  This course is a survey of
Soviet history.  We begin with pre-revolutionary conditions at the turn of the
century, appraise 1917 revolutions and then proceed through the varied stages,
policies,  leaders and both their internal and global impact through 1991 and
beyond as outlined in the topics section of this syllabus.  An
interdisciplinary approach is the foundation of analysis and critical
appraisal.  Political, social, cultural, economic and other modes of
evaluation are implemented.  Soviet history can be complex yet extremely
fascinating.  We will engage in an interesting journey and evaluation of the
Soviet past and its influence on the present and future.

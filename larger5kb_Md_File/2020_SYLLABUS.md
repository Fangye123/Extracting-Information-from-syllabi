**__Course Description:__** This survey course begins with the European
arrival in the Americas and ends in 1865 with the conclusion of the American
Civil War. Focusing primarily on that portion of North America that became the
United States, it traces the evolution of several clusters of European
colonial settlements into an ethnically diverse republic with a developing
industrial economy.

_

_**Course Objectives**__ : In this introductory-level course, students should
learn to read carefully and critically, paying particular attention to
chronology and to the causes and effects of historical events and phenomena.
Students will learn to read and interpret historical documents, on which we
will base our class discussions. They will learn to write analytically and how
to present and support an argument (thesis) in both prepared essays and essay
examinations.

This course is approved for Goal VI /C (Understanding the Individual, Society,
and Culture) of the [general education
requirements](http://www.uncc.edu/catalog/yr9799/bacregs.html#goals) for
undergraduates at UNC-Charlotte.

_

_**Course Requirements**__ :

The required _reading_ for this course is as follows: David Goldfield, et al.,
_The American Journey_ , 2nd ed., vol. 1 (with optional [companion
website](http://www.prenhall.com/goldfield)); Paul Boller and Ronald Story,
eds., _A More Perfect Union: Documents in U.S. History_ , 4th ed., vol. 1;
[Thomas Paine, _Common
Sense_](http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/D/1776-1800/paine/CM/sensexx.htm); and
[Frederick Douglass, _Narrative of the Life of Frederick
Douglass_](http://www.toptags.com/aama/books/book10.htm). Daily reading
assignments are listed in the course schedule, below.

Required [written work](written_assignments.htm) for this course consists of
one short paper, ten in-class Tuesday quizzes, a midterm examination, and a
final exam scheduled for Tuesday 8 May at 3:30. _Quizzes_ will be short-
answer, with questions based on the assigned primary source reading since the
previous quiz.   Midterm and final _examinations_ , which will be based on
both lectures and reading, will be predominantly essay questions. **There will
be no make-up quizzes; missed exams and late papers will be penalized heavily.
Of the eleven quizzes, only ten grades will count toward the final grade.
Students may miss one quiz; for those who take all eleven quizzes, we will
simply drop the lowest grade.**

Finally, students are required to participate in both in-class and [online
discussions](online_discussion.htm).  The first meeting of this course will
include a tutorial on how to use the website for online discussions.  **It is
the responsibility of students who miss the tutorial or have questions about
participation in the online discussions to see Prof. Kierner or Ms. Perella
for additional instructions.** Please see below for the schedule of both
online and in-class discussions.

_Course grades_ will be computed as follows: 20% for the paper; 20% (total)
for the quizzes; 20% for the midterm; 30% for the final; and 10% for
discussion.

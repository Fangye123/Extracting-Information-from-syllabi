**History 011**  
**Spring 2000**

**Course Description from Catalogue:** An exploration of major themes,
milestones, and debates in the history of the global community since 1350.
Using examples from around the world, the course will explore such issues as
the causes of war and revolution; the impact of religion, science and
technology on human communities; the development of global systems of slavery,
colonialism, and labor migration; the growth of empires; the rise of
nationalisms; and perceived differences between "East" and "West."   The
course will also introduce students to the art and science of historical
inquiry using primary sources, maps, pictures, and material culture. ****

**Meetings:** We will normally have lectures on Monday and Wednesday and
[discussion groups](sections.html) on Thursday or Friday. Attendance is
required. We expect students to use material presented in lectures and
discussions in their assignments. Make sure that you understand what you read
and hear. Write down questions and clear them up: go back to your texts and
notes; ASK questions in discussion sections; and post questions on the course
listserv, where staff can post answers.

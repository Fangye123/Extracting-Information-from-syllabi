Course description and
required
texts:
This course offers an overview of America's heartland from the time of European contact
through the twentieth century.  The term "Midwest" has been applied to a large area - as many as
twelve states - and implies that there is a homogeneity about the region.  In fact, the Midwest is
diverse; it has a rich, complex history, and it eludes clear definition.  Often characterized as
hospitable and hard-working if wholesome and drab, Midwesterners themselves are unclear
about what it means to be Midwestern, though they sense that there is something quintessentially
American about it.
Although the course considers the Midwest as a whole, it focuses on history of the
"eastern" or "lower" Midwest - the "Old Northwest" created in 1787.  The seventeenth century
saw interaction among Native Americans and French explorers, missionaries, trappers, and
traders.  Through the eighteenth century, European powers and the new United States struggled
to dominate the region.  In the nineteenth century, upland southerners, northerners, and European
immigrants settled as boosters praised  the region as one of progress, free labor, and prosperity,
despite the displacement of Native Americans and racism.  The twentieth century was a time of
industrialization, urbanization, progressive politics and charges of provinciality, prosperity, a
"rustbelt" economy, and attempts at renaissance.  As we look at this history, we can ponder what
being Midwestern means.
The required texts are:
R. David Edmunds, The Shawnee Prophet
John Mack Faragher, Sugar Creek: Life on the Illinois Prairie
Lucy Eldersveld Murphy and Wendy Hamand Venet, eds., Midwestern Women: Work,
Community, and Leadership at the Crossroads
Francis Parkman, La Salle and the Discovery of the Great West
Jon C. Teaford, Cities of the Heartland: The Rise and Fall of the Industrial
Midwest
Some required readings are on reserve in Duggan Library or online.  There are also several
films.

The final course grade will be calculated from the following:

Three exams. One is a take-home essay
exam (5%).  Two are in-class exams:  a midterm (25%) and a final (30%).  Students are expected
to take the exams on the days scheduled.  In cases of necessity, requests for make-ups should be
made before the day of the exam. 
A two-page book review (10%).  Consulting the
instructor, each student will choose a monograph and write a review of it.  The review should
state the book's argument, the sources and methods employed, briefly summarize the text, and
assess the strength of the interpretation.

A paper with
presentation (7-10 pages in length) (20%).  This paper
will be an analysis of a topic selected by the student and approved by the instructor.

Class participation (10%) includes collegial
involvement in class discussions.

Course Description: Since the 1970s, the state governments have experienced a
resurgence as units of governance. These alaboratories of democracya within
the U.S. federal system are today the primary policy innovators and delivery
systems for services of all sorts, from social services to environmental
protection. The local governments, in turn, are creatures of the states and
the most visible partners in the lives of citizens. They have also become
stronger and much more active in addressing problems of governance, taking on
new tasks as well as adopting new approaches to old problems. This course is
an introduction to the structure, processes, and politics of state and local
government, and the policy challenges confronting them in the 2000as.

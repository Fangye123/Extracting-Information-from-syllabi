Readings for specific dates will be announced in class. They may vary slightly
from the following table as the pace of the class dictates. Students are
responsible for keeping up with any such changes, which will also be posted on
this web site. Chapter references are to Upshur, _World History._

The Unit links in the left navigation bar take you to lecture notes for the
various topics listed. Links will be available at the beginning of each
section. **WARNING** : These notes are for the most part outlines only. They
are very rough, and they are no substitute for class attendance! They are
intended to remind students of important topics and points covered in class.

**Introduction  
**

History 404 focuses on immigrant flows to the United States since the late
nineteenth century, and examines the impacts of those movements on the
evolution of ethnic identity and inter-group relations in this country. The
course discusses the experiences of European, Asian, and Latin American
immigrants and their descendants. For purposes of comparison and contrast, it
also takes into account the experiences of African-Americans in the United
States. Likewise, especially for the period since World War II, History 404
attempts to put what has happened in the United States in the context of
events and developments in other nations that have become destinations of
substantial numbers of immigrants.  

Reporting basic information about immigration and ethnicity is fundamental to
History 404, and students interested in learning more about the stories of
individual ethnic groups or particular events will receive advice and
encouragement. The emphasis in the course, however, is on analysis rather than
on narrative. The special concern is to expose students, through the concepts
and techniques of the social science approach to the study of the past, to an
examination of underlying forces and processes.

**Lectures& Readings  
**

After an introductory week, History 404 divides into three blocks. The first
covers the period from the beginning of the "New Immigration" late in the
post-Civil War era to the imposition of an overall program of immigration
restriction in the 1920s. The second discusses developments associated with
the Depression, World War II, and the 1950s. The final segment of History 404
begins with an outline of immigration to the United States and to other
destinations since the revision of American admissions policies in 1965. It
discusses legal and clandestine immigration and refugees flows in the
contemporary world, and examines a variety of cultural, demographic, economic,
and legal issues stemming from those movements and from ethnic group
relations.  

Students will read the following five books:  

![](prball.gif)Thomas J. Archdeacon, _Becoming American: An Ethnic History_
(NY: Free Press, 1983)  
![](prball.gif) David M. Reimers, _Still the Golden Door: The Third World
Comes to America_ (NY: Columbia University Press, 1992)  
![](prball.gif) Hasia Diner, _Erin's Daughters in America: Irish Immigrant
Women in the Nineteenth Century_ (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press,
1983)  
![](prball.gif) George J. Sanchez, _Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity,
Culture and Identity in Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945_ (NY: Oxford University
Press, 1993)  
![](prball.gif) Mary C. Waters, _Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in
America_ (Berkeley : University of California Press, 1990)  

Although not textbooks, the Archdeacon and Reimers volumes can serve as such
for purposes of this course. The remaining books are supplementary readings:
Diner for Block 1, Sanchez for Block 2, and Waters for Block 3.

**Electronic Media  
**

Use of electronic media will be integral to History 404\. As a student, each
of you has a right, free from additional charges beyond your tuition and fees,
to an E-mail account and access to the Internet. In order to perform
satisfactorily in History 404, you will have to take advantage of that right.
I intend to use E-mail to distribute to the class notes and other lecture-
related materials that can be put in a format suitable for use with that
medium. Finally, E-mail will serve as a means of enabling students to contact
me outside of office hours and of allowing me to deliver messages,
individually and collectively, to members of the class.  

Last semester I constructed a home page for History 404\. During the first
couple of weeks of the current semester, I hope to update the materials for
use with the new syllabus. The WWW offers advantages beyond those of E-mail,
which is a medium best suited for the dissemination of simple text documents.
The WWW makes possible the transmission of enhanced graphics and other
similarly complex materials that I may include in classroom presentations.
Moreover, a number of web pages with contents relevant to historians and to
other students of immigration and ethnicity already exist, and the web page
for History 404 can incorporate links that will enable students to have easy
recourse to those sites. The 404 web is likely to move to a new address early
in the semester; its current URL is http://www.wisc.edu/history/404tja/.

**Grading  
**

History 404 involves three, non-cumulative, 75-minute examinations. Each will
cover material from the block of the course just completed. The first
examination will take place during class on Tuesday, 25 February. The second
examination will take place during class on Tuesday, 15 April. The third exam
will constitute end-term scheduled for Tuesday, 13 May, at 7:45 A.M. Like the
preceding pair of examinations, the final will also take 75 minutes.  

Combined performances on the three exams will substantially determine each
student's grade. Unless the student requests otherwise, the three exams will
be equally weighted. Flexibility in the grading parameters, however, will
allow students to minimize the impact of a substandard early performance. At
the student's option, he or she may choose either to drop the score on the
first exam or to have it count twice as much as the grade on the second. In
the former situation, Exam 1 will not count, Exam 2 will contribute 50 percent
of his or her grade, and Exam 3 the other 50 percent. In the latter Exam 1
will contribute 44 percent; Exam 2, 22 percent; and Exam 3, 34 percent of his
or her grade.  

Your participation is essential to all aspects of the course, and especially
to the section meetings. The teaching assistant will evaluate each student's
participation and, on the basis of that assessment, will advise me regarding
adjustments in final grades. Depending on the evidence supplied by her, I may
raise or lower the final grades of individual students by as much as five (5)
points. Please remember that absence from class or from section is a
fundamental form of non-participation, and that a passive presence at moments
requiring active involvement is only slightly better.  

Students with final averages of 90 or better will receive an "A." Likewise,
students whose final averages fall in the following ranges will receive no
less than the letter grade specified: 85-89, "AB"; 80-84, "B"; 75-79, "BC";
70-74 "C"; 60-69, "D"; and below 60, "F." Beyond those guarantees, final
grades will reflect the average of each student's point total and her or his
standing relative to the mean cumulative score earned across the class during
the semester.

**Office Hours  
**

I shall do my best to make myself available for consultations with students.
My scheduled office hours are held in 5133 Humanities on Tuesdays from 4:00 to
5:00 P.M. and on Wednesdays from 1:00 to 2:00 P.M. I am often in the office at
other times as well, and you are free to stop by whenever I am there. I shall
try to accommodate you unless other pressing business is pending. You may also
make appointments to see me at times other than the scheduled office hours. To
do so, please see me after class, or call me at the office (263-1778) or at
home (251-7264). Both phones have answering machines, so leave a message if
necessary. E-mail is an especially effective way to contact me; the address is
tjarchde@facstaff.wisc.edu.

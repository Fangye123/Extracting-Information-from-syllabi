COURSE DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS**

This course has been designed toward three principal curricular goals.
First, it is an option for the College's First Course, the initial two-block
academic element in the [ First-Year
Experience](http://www.ColoradoCollege.edu/FYE/).  Further, it offers students
the opportunity to fulfill Colorado College's Alternative Perspectives: C
(either Western or non-Western studies) requirement.  Finally, it presents the
student with particular interest in the past with one of several possible
pathways into the [ History](http://www.ColoradoCollege.edu/Dept/HY/) major.

The fall 2001 version _Culture, Society, and History_ will pose four
fundamental questions in the development of world civilizations:

  * How do the material conditions of human communities frame their activities?
  * What notions of authority underlie these communities' political organization?
  * What do different historical cultures understand to be beautiful and orderly in human experience and creativity?
  * How do societal interconnections shape human experience?

In offering students the materials to respond to these questions, the course
will address the general shape of European and East Asian civilizations from
antiquity to the twentieth century. Rather than survey these broad culture
areas chronologically, however, its readings and discussions will begin with
twentieth-century circumstances and recur to ancient origins to discern
intracultural development and continuity as well as intercultural likeness and
difference.

All students will be expected to complete readings before the discussion for
which they are assigned, to participate actively in large-group sessions and
electronic conversation, and to complete written work and oral presentations
in a thoughtful and timely fashion. Discussion and lecture topics suggest
themes for each class meeting; awareness of these themes will encourage
students to read critically, and to come to each meeting ready to share
individual impressions and interpretations.  Numerous electronic journaling
assignments throughout the two blocks will offer the opportunity for writing
practice and continue discussion outside the classroom.  During Block 1, two
short (five-page) critical essays on common questions will encourage the
development of skills in writing and revision.  A longer (ten-page) multi-
source-based paper on individual topics in historical material culture will
enhance library and electronic research capabilities; its in-class
presentation will require Powerpoint usage and clear oral presentation.
Finally, a take-home essay exam will enable students' synthesis of the variety
of course materials and experiences.

###  ASSESSMENT

Successful work in this course presumes regular attendance and participation.

  * 20% of the final grade will depend on written response (journaling) to individual readings and discussions,
  * 50% on two short critical essays and a longer research paper with brief in-class presentation
  * 30% on examinations.

###  BOOKS FOR PURCHASE

The following works are available for purchase in the College bookstore.  All
represent useful elements in the permanent library of an educated individual,
but they form a costly package.  The instructors will be sympathetic to
students' sharing of materials, but urge that each member of the class own
his/her own photocopied course packet.

DESCRIPTION: This course introduces the study of history as a way of
understanding today's world. You will most likely live your life in large
cities, make your living in a changing and often bewildering economy, find
yourself the object of selling campaigns by politicians and hucksters of ideas
and values. More than once in your life you may have to reconsider basic
attitudes and values or train yourself in new skills. Your daily life will be
affected by events and conditions far from where you live and work. This
course will explore how that world has developed over the last 400 years. ** |
| **

  
OBJECTIVES: Working through the materials of this course will not only give
you important information for understanding the development of our world. You
will also learn skills of analysis, writing and reading. You will learn to
place issues into historical context, to consider evidence, and to develop
arguments. It is important to keep up with assignments and to come to class
ready to participate achieve these objectives. The essays, Web Forum
assignments, and final exam will assess your progress in achieving these
objectives.**

**Margaret L. King, _Western Civilization: A Social and Cultural History_ ,
vol. 2: 1500-The Present (Prentice Hall, 2000) a textbook [TB]**  
---|---  
![bullet](_themes/subterra/subbul1d.gif)|

**S _haping of the Modern World From the Enlightenment to the Present,_ 3d
edition (Simon Schuster, 1998),   source book [SB]**  
  
**The text book also has primary sources. In addition we have a whole book of
primary sources. Learn the difference between a primary and secondary source.
Why do historians depend on primary rather than secondary sources? I will
distribute a [guide](c4guide.htm) to using primary sources. Use it regularly.
**

**The text book is a mine of information. You should use it as a reference.
You will find a narration of events as well as various aids like maps,
chronologies, time lines, and pictures. As you use these materials keep in
mind the difference between an EVENT, TOPIC, and ISSUE** **. An event is
something specific that happens at a given time and place [Congress declares
war on Japan on Dec. 8, 1941]; a topic is something general, a subject for
study or discussion [Congress, the Civil War]; an issue is a controversial
topic, a subject that divides people [nuclear weapons, abortion]. You will
find that some topics become issues in certain contexts. Thus, monarchy is a
topic that in the 18th century became an issue in the period of the American
and French Revolutions. It is important to keep in mind that events, actions
by real people, are always behind historical topics. A good story teller
knows** **the importance of character and action.** | **REQUIREMENTS:** |

>  It is the student's responsibility  to give the instructor an alternate
email address if the student desires to receive information at an email
address other than the student's ASU email address. This alternate email
address must be sent to the instructor within 48 hours of the beginning of the
course. If the alternate email address has not been received by the instructor
by Midnight on June 30th then the student is responsible for all information
delivered to their ASU email account. Failure to complete assignments because
the student did not check their ASU email address for updated information will
not be a valid excuse.

**Welcome to THE 320:  
History of The Theatre I**  
  
This on-line course surveys European theatre history from the time of the
ancient Greeks until the end of the 17th century-covering roughly 2,200 years
of tradition and change. It is designed to provide a general overview of what
many theatre historians have agreed are key moments in this history.  
  
The site contains many links to other sites that help to fill in the social,
political, philosophical and artistic contexts in which these traditions and
innovations emerged. By completing the readings and browsing the links, we
hope you'll have a better idea of how theatre and society interacted with each
other in varied times and places.  
  
  
---|---  
The course is designed for upper-division students with college-level reading
skills, who are also self-motivated and self-disciplined enough to complete
the work within the semester time frame. Though you may progress through the
readings and links at your own pace, you will be asked to participate in
regular on-line discussions that tend to proceed rather chronologically
through the material. There are also several assignments with firm deadlines.
The "Syllabus" links to the left provide more detail on the course
requirements and procedures. Please read over the syllabus before you get
started, and refer to it frequently as the course progresses!  
  
_Note: the course assumes some familiarity with web-based instruction, in
particular web browsing, dial-up modems, password protections, discussion
boards, and word processing. If you believe your computer skills aren't up to
navigating this on-line environment, contact Computer Support Services
immediately for individualized help._

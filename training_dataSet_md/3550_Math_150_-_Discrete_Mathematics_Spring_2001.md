**Core (General Education) Skill Objectives:**

    

  1. **Thinking Skills:**

(a)

    Students will use reasoned standards in solving problems and presenting arguments.
  2. **Communication Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...read with comprehension and the ability to analyze and evaluate.
(b)

    ...listen with an open mind and respond with respect.
(c)

    ...access information and communicate using current technology.

  3. **Life Value Skills:**

(a)

    Students will analyze, evaluate and respond to ethical issues from an informed personal value system.

  4. **Cultural Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...understand culture as an evolving set of world views with diverse historical roots that provides a framework for guiding, expressing, and interpreting human behavior.
(b)

    ...demonstrate knowledge of the signs and symbols of another culture.
(c)

    ...participate in activity that broadens their customary way of thinking.

  5. **Aesthetic Skills:**

(a)

    Students will develop an aesthetic sensitivity.

**Specific Course Goals:**

     Those happen to coincide with some of the NCTM (National Council of Teachers of Mathematics) ``standards'' for mathematics education. We have: 

The students shall ...

  1. ...develop an appreciation of mathematics, its history and its applications. 

  2. ...become confident in their own ability to do mathematics. 

  3. ...become mathematical problem solvers. 

  4. ...learn to communicate mathematical content. 

  5. ...learn to reason mathematically. 

**General Education Course Objectives:**

    

  1. **Thinking Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...develop algorithmic skills; 

(b)

    ...learn combinatorial techniques and solving combinatorial problems; 

(c)

    ...explore sets, relations, and functions; 

(d)

    ...study some basic concepts of Graph Theory. For example, consider the most efficient way for a mailman to deliver the mail in a certain part of a city. 

(e)

    ...study _matching problems_. For example, assigning bus operators to routes, or a basketball coach must assign a player to guard each player on the opposing team in such a way as to minimize the opponent's total score. 

(f)

    ...study _network flows_ problems. For example, a long-distance telephone company must move messages from one city to another. The number of of telephone calls that the company can handle at a given time is limited by the capacity of its cable and its switching equipment. 

(g)

    ...learn basic counting principles, Binomial Theorem, and Pascal's Triangle. 

(h)

    ...apply those basic combinatorial concepts in solving some probability problems. 

(i)

    ...study recurrence relations, difference equations, and generating functions. 

(j)

    ...learn some fundamentals of mathematical logic and learn to recognize valid and invalid reasoning. 

  2. **Communication Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...collect a portfolio during the course and write a reflection paper. 

(b)

    ...turn in written solutions to occasional problems. 

(e)

    ...learn to use the Internet resources and present the findings in class. 

  3. **Life Value Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...develop an appreciation for the intellectual honesty of deductive reasoning. 

(b)

    ...listen with an open mind and respond with respect. 

(c)

    ...understand the need to do one's own work, to honestly challenge oneself to master the material.

  4. **Cultural Skills:** Students will explore the importance and the historical development of the topics covered in the course. 

  5. **Aesthetic Skills:** Students will ... 

(a)

    ...develop an appreciation for the austere intellectual beauty of deductive reasoning. 

(b)

    ...develop an appreciation for mathematical elegance.

**Content:**

     This course is aimed at the students who major/minor in Mathematics Education. 

**Course Philosophy and Procedure**

     Two key components of a success in the course are regular attendance and a fair amount of constant, every-day study. You should try to make sure that your total study time per week at least triples the time spent in class. 

**Grading** will be based on three in-class exams (![$ 100$](img1.gif) points
each), a cumulative final exam (![$ 200$](img2.gif) points), class
participation, take-home problems, projects, group practice exams and
portfolios.

My **grading scale** is

A=90%, AB=87%, B=80%, BC=77%, C=70%, CD=67%, D=60%.

**Americans with Disability Act:**

     If you are a person with a disability and require any auxiliary aids, services or other accommodations for this class, please see me and Wayne Wojciechowski in Murphy Center Room 320 (796-3085) within ten days to discuss your accommodation needs. 

This syllabus is tentative and may be adjusted during the semester.

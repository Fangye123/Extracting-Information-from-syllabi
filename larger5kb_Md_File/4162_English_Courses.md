Statement of Honor  
We, the Meredith Community, are committed to developing and affirming in each
student a sense of personal honor and responsibility. Uncompromising honesty
and forthrightness are essential elements of this commitment. The Honor System
is a method by which individual honors are protected and maintained. Any
dishonorable action will be regarded as a violation of this commitment, and
corrective action will be taken. If I am in violation of the Honor Code, to
prevent jeopardizing the Honor System or weakening our system of self-
government, I have an obligation to report myself to the proper authorities.
If I am aware of a violation of the Honor System by another student, I shall
call this matter to the attention of that student as a violation of
responsibility to the community. In choosing Meredith College, I am accepting
the Honor System as a way of life. As a Meredith student, I am responsible for
insuring that the Honor System is at all times carried out.

SYLLABUS  
English 111E: Principles of Writing  
Dr. Rebecca Duncan  
Spring 2000  
106 Joyner Hall 760-2291  
duncanr@meredith.edu

COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES This is an introductory course in critical
reading and academic writing as well as a quest for your unique writing voice.
Through readings, discussions, and a number of informal and formal writings,
we will practice skills and strategies which can be applied immediately in
your college course work and later in professional contexts. This course also
includes an introduction to library research and use of secondary sources and
numerous opportunities to improve the precision and sophistication of your use
of the language. Upon successful completion of this course, you will be
prepared to write well in subsequent college courses.

TEXTS AND COURSE MATERIALS Axelrod and Cooper, The St. Martin's Guide to
Writing Hodges, Harbrace College Handbook (the red one) Wharton, The Age of
Innocence (Dover edition) College level dictionary Pocket folder for
submitting essays (no inside attachments, please) an e-mail address, plus
registration for Anlon course

COURSE REQUIREMENTS In addition to regular informal writings, research
assignments and responses to readings, you will write seven formal essays, one
of which will involve library research. In order to pass the course, you must
complete all writing assignments, pass the department competency test, and
offer a self-assessment in two individual conferences. THE COMPETENCY TEST
WILL TAKE PLACE ON TUESDAY, APRIL 4 at 5:30 P.M., WITH THE RETAKE ON TUESDAY,
APRIL 25, ALSO AT 5:30 P.M. If you have a class scheduled at this time, please
see me immediately.

ACADEMIC HONESTY If we are to work together to develop your writing, we need
to proceed on a basis of trust. I must know that you are presenting your own
thoughts in the kind of language that you are able to produce without
significant help or influence from others. Please become familiar with the
Statement of Honor (reprinted below) and follow the plagiarism and academic
honesty guidelines discussed in class.

ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION You are expected to attend class sessions
prepared to discuss the assigned readings and exercises. Although I do not
consider any absences to be excused, you may miss two class sessions without
penalty. These two absences should be saved for illness and urgent personal
matters. Please do not schedule (or allow others to schedule for you)
appointments or travel plans which conflict with class meetings.

LATE WORK It is difficult to catch up with college course work when you get
behind. Please complete all work on time. I do, however, understand that you
will not write your finest paper on the night before a big exam. For this
reason, I will allow one late paper, provided that you discuss the matter with
me at least 24 hours before the due date. If, after making an honest effort to
write an essay, you find yourself staring at a blank piece of paper or
computer screen, please come and talk to me during my office hours. There are
a few simple strategies that can help you overcome writer's block.

OFFICE HOURS MWF 11-12 and MW 1-2 T TH 1-2 ...and by appointment

GRADING Your achievement in this course will be measured by quizzes,
participation and written work. Although all of your essays will be graded
(and all essays must be completed), your course grade will be determined
largely by improvement throughout the semester. Please note that the grammar
portion of the competency test will count for 10 percent of your final grade,
and that the essay portion of the test will count as a formal essay. Shortly
after the competency test, I will provide details concerning calculation of
course grades. In the meantime, please let me know if you have questions or
concerns about your progress.

BAD WEATHER POLICY When ice or snow make driving dangerous, please listen for
the college's radio or television announcements or call the weather line
(760-2384), then use your best judgment. If morning road conditions are bad,
please check again before writing off a later class. (Most ice in this area
melts by 10 a.m. or so.) Under any conditions, even if the college is closed,
please stay on schedule with readings and written assignments.

STATEMENT OF HONOR We, the Meredith Community, are committed to developing and
affirming in each student a sense of personal honor and responsibility.
Uncompromising honesty and forthrightness are essential elements of this
commitment. The Honor System is a method by which individual honors are
protected and maintained. Any dishonorable action will be regarded as a
violation of this commitment, and corrective action will be taken. If I am in
violation of the Honor Code, to prevent jeopardizing the Honor System or
weakening our system of self-government, I have an obligation to report myself
to the proper authorities. If I am aware of a violation of the Honor System by
another student, I shall call this matter to the attention of that student as
a violation of the responsibility to the community. In choosing Meredith
College, I am accepting the Honor System as a way of life. As a Meredith
student, I am responsible for insuring that the Honor Code is at all times
carried out.

FINAL EXAM: Friday, May 5 6:00 (location to be announced) If you cannot take
the test at this time, you must submit a written explanation to me by Friday,
March 31.

ESSAY GUIDELINES

You will be writing a number of ungraded pieces as well as formal graded
essays. When you begin each assignment, you should have a clear idea of the
kind of writing that is expected. Please follow the guidelines which apply to
the piece you are submitting.

KINDS OF WRITINGS  
1\. Informal writings and responses to readings. These are generally one page
in length. They may be handwritten. Although they should be in full sentences
and broken down into paragraphs, they need not be organized under a single
thesis. I am interested in seeing the quality of your thoughts. Please use the
writing process as a means of discovering what you have to say on the assigned
topic. You can use your preparation time most efficiently if you read the
prompt before starting to read the assigned piece.  
2\. Formal essays. These essays will always be written in stages. Until late
in the semester, I will require a rough draft and a final revision of each.
Both the draft and the final version should be organized under the rubric of a
single thesis presented in an introductory paragraph. Each subsequent
paragraph should develop the thesis, using concrete examples and supporting
information. Each essay also must have a conclusion that puts the rest of the
essay into a larger perspective. These writings also need an original title.
Instead of "Persuasive Essay," you might use "Why Eating Disorders are a
Problem at Meredith." Our writing text offers excellent descriptions of each
writing situation that we will practice. When preparing to write an essay,
please consult the "Summary of Basic Features" section of the chapter, and
please ask for help when you need it.

ESSAY FORMAT Informal writings may be handwritten, but they must be in blue or
black ink. Formal essays must be typed and double-spaced, with a 10 or 12
point font and one inch margins on all sides. There should be no title page,
but instead the following heading in the upper left corner of page one:

Name  
ENG 111  
Dr. Rebecca Duncan  
Date

Then skip a space and center the title. After the title skip one space and
begin the essay, indenting paragraphs. Number all pages, either in the upper
right corner or the bottom center.

WRITING FOLDER When you turn in a draft or a revision of a formal essay, place
it in the folder that I have provided. Keep all papers loose, so that I can
take them out. With the final revision, include all drafts that you have
written, especially those with my comments. Include the checklist for that
assignment, but remove all other papers from the folder.

GRAMMAR COMPONENT OF THE COURSE

An important part of this course is the study of those basic elements of
grammar which will help you express and present yourself as a college-educated
professional. All Meredith students must demonstrate their understanding of
grammar by passing a competency test designed, administered and scored by
English Department faculty. The only alternative to passing this test is to
transfer in two full semesters of approved freshman English course credit.
Attached is a description of the test and testing procedures. Please note that
you must pass the test in order to pass the course. Also, please keep in mind
that grammar competency will determine 10 percent of your course grade.

Our preparation for competency test will involve the following:

1\. Study of grammar basics in the Hodges' Harbrace Handbook  
2\. Individual study of grammar using the online course "Griselda's Guide to
Grammar" (listed in contents of English Department web site)  
3\. Scored quizzes available in the Anlon online course package (See syllabus
for dates.)  
4\. Written exercises provided by the instructor  
5\. Written quizzes on which you show your understanding of grammar rules  
6\. Attendance at grammar review sessions conducted by Learning Center tutors  
7\. Individual instruction and assistance (working with me or Learning Center
tutors)

Your success on the competency test depends upon your willingness to use each
of these resources and activities to your advantage. Only an active approach
to learning will enable you to understand grammar rules and apply them. I will
offer any help that I can, but you must ask for clarification when a concept
is not clear, and you must practice until you have mastered each topic.

ENG 475 - INTRO TO LITERARY CRITICISM  
Spring 2000 - Taylor

Texts: _Literary Criticism_ , 2nd Ed. by Charles Bressler

Goals: In 1990, I audited this course (then taught by Dr. Walton) because I
had read a column by Michael Skube on lit crit, shared his contempt for some
trendy literary criticism, and wanted to be informed in my contempt. After
auditing the course, I taught it in 1991 and 1993 because I needed to go
through the material again; I had come away with more questions than answers.
I taught the course most recently in the spring 1998. I have not entirely lost
my contempt for some contemporary approaches to criticism, but that contempt
has become less important than questions the course raises about my own
unexamined assumptions.

What I hope to get this time through is a clearer picture of how the goals and
assumptions of the reader (critic) have changed over the centuries. I hope to
discover commonalities of approach, to see how Marxist criticism is like the
older historical criticism, to see how structuralism builds on the approach of
formalism. But I'd also like to look into the void: to imagine what it would
be like teaching literature if there were no received canon, if all texts were
regarded as equal, and various readings were regarded as equally valid. I
don't predict that state will arrive, but I can at least understand why it
might.

As a teacher, I am interested in how literary theory can be helpful to my
students. I agree with Robert Scholes (Textual Power) that often teachers go
into the classroom and dazzle students by using some of the techniques of
formalist or structuralist critics instead of showing students the techniques
and inviting them to interpret for themselves. I am interested in whether
certain critical approaches are appropriate to certain works and whether the
works that get anthologized are those most amenable to particular critical
approaches.

I now acknowledge that in college I was trained to read with the assumptions
of a formalist, though nobody explained that to me at the time. I thought I
was just learning to read carefully. I still wonder if there is such a thing
as "just reading carefully" or if everyone reads with unexamined assumptions.
I wonder whether the skills in close reading can be transferred to other
situations: reading the underlying politics in a college English department,
reading the hidden appeals of an ad campaign, separating healthy self-interest
from selfishness in citizen protests about the location sewage disposal plant.
Requirements: Every week we shall do a reading in one approach to literary
criticism. Every third week, you will do a short writing assignment: a single-
spaced, one-page analysis of one of the 4 works analyzed by student writers in
text (or a substitute of your choice), an analysis illustrating the approach
we are studying that week. (In past years, I have written with the class every
week, so I have an additional hand-out to throw into the mix.)

The course will culminate in one 4-page paper in which you look at a literary
work using two different theoretical approaches.

Schedule of readings from Literary Criticism:

Jan 18 Ch. 1 - What is literary theory? What is literature?  
Jan 25 Ch. 2 - What is the history of literary criticism?  
Feb 1 Ch. 3 - New Criticism (formalism)  
Feb 8 Ch. 4 - Reader Response Feb 15 Ch. 5 - Structuralism  
Feb 22 Ch. 6 - Deconstruction  
Feb 29 Ch. 6 - Deconstruction continued

Apr 25 Final paper due

Attendance policy: Be here. What you get out of this course will be directly
proportional to what you put in.

Snow policy: I am a commuter who regularly drives on snowy roads but who stays
off the roads during blizzards or ice storms.

Grading:  
A = No more than one absence; all written assignments presented on time; A
paper

paper  
C = No more than 3 absences; one or more assignments late; final paper B or C  
Failure to meet standards for a C will result in lower grade

 ENG 202 Development of English Literature/Spring 2000

Dr. Grathwohl Office: MW 2-3; Tues. 11-12; F 12-1_ Joyner 118b Phone:
829-8358/8507(W); 932-2603 (H)

Texts: _Norton Anthology of English Literature_ , 6th ed., vols. 1 and 2

On reserve: Baugh, History of English Literature 420.9.B32h Moody and Lovett,
A History of English Literature 820.9.M77 Thrall and Hibbard, rev. Holman,
Handbook to English Literature 803.T41

Course Objectives: This course builds on what you learned in English 201: it
is intended to extend your knowledge and enjoyment of British literature and
to help you hone your ability to read and write analytically. We will meet a
great many authors this semester, some familiar and some new to you.

Preparation, Attendance and Participation in Class: A glance at the day-by-day
syllabus will tell you all you need to know on this subject. To miss a day of
either preparation or attendance is to miss an author-or two, or even three.
It is crucial that you keep up with your work and put attendance at this class
at the very top of your priority list. If that paper is stuck in the printer,
abandon it and get yourself to Joyner at class time! Missed quizzes cannot be
made up, and excessive absences will hurt your grade. If you must miss class,
it is your responsibility to notify me and to get the assignment for the next
day -- preferably from a classmate.

The _Norton Anthology_ is a wonderful resource not only for the depth and
breadth of its selections but also for its introductions to both periods and
authors. You are always responsible for the introductions both to periods and
to authors on the day we take them up.

Like English 201, this is a course specifically designed for people who are
not experts. You may want to consult the reserve list for further background
on authors, periods, and terminology; but you do not need and do not have
permission to use the interpretations of others in preparing your papers. The
one exception to this principle is the short research project; I will make it
clear what kinds of sources are appropriate for it.

Academic Honesty: A scholarly community like Meredith is founded and depends
for its meaning on academic honesty. I fully support the Honor System, and I
remind you of your commitment to the Meredith Statement of Honor by which you
agreed to uphold that system. I will refer any case of academic dishonesty to
the Honor Council. In addition, a student who is caught cheating on any
assignment, however small, will not pass my course.

Papers: Papers are to be typed, in correct MLA format. You will submit a
partial draft of the research paper to me before the due date for feedback,
and we will have a required conference on your third paper. I encourage you to
take advantage of our excellent Learning Center, as well. You must speak to me
24 hours in advance for late work to be excused. Late papers drop one-half a
letter grade for each day they are late. No makeups for missed quizzes except
in cases of genuine emergency.

Snow Policy: WRAL announces college closings, or you may call 760-2384. If
school is open, I am usually here, but I commute 30 miles to school. Other
commuters should use their judgment.

Grading: You must complete all written assignments in order to pass the
course. Three tests, 30%; final exam, 15%; three papers, 45%; reflections, 5%;
quizzes and recitation of 40 lines of poetry, 5%.

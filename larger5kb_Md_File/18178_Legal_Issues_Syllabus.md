education and student affairs operate  
2\. Demonstrate an understanding of current legal issues in higher education,
including pertinent civil rights and ethical issues

**_Disclaimer_**  
The instructor is not an attorney and is not qualified to provide legal
advice. Should legal advice be needed by an individual taking this course,
proper legal counsel can be attained by consulting an attorney of one's
choice.

**_Methods of Instruction:_**  
Lecture, discussion, small groups, guest speakers, class presentations by
students. Resources for class are available at
<http://www2.msstate.edu/~mwilson/legal.htm>**.**

**_Texts:_**  
    Kaplin, W. A., & Lee, B. A. (1997). _A legal guide for student affairs professions_ _._ San Francisco: Jossey-Bass. 

    American Psychological Association _._ (1994). _Publication manual of the American Psychological Association_ (4th edition). Washington, D.C.: Author. _(Strongly recommended.)_

**_Student Activities:_**  
Assignments are due at the _beginning_ of class on the dates indicated. Late
assignments will receive a lower grade unless we have made other arrangements
_prior to class_. You may receive little to no written feedback on late
assignments. In-class assignments can be done only at the designated time. The
final examination may only be rescheduled under extreme and documented
circumstances if the instructor has been contacted prior the start of the
exam. See schedule for assignment due dates.

High quality assignments will address all aspects as specified in the
following descriptions _AND_ be well-written. Excessive typographical and
grammatical errors detract from your work and are reflected in your grade.
Written assignments should be submitted in APA Style (4th edition). If you and
a classmate work with each other to critique your assignments, each of you is
likely to submit better work.

Please staple all assignments and do not place them in binders or folders.

> **Class Participation**  
>  It is important that you participate in this course by sharing your
thoughts and reactions to readings, speakers and general class discussions.
The input of each student is valued and valuable. Your attendance for the full
class period is expected, and you are responsible for everything that is
covered, distributed, or announced during class. If an absence is unavoidable,
you should arrange with a classmate to receive handouts and announcements.
Your attendance directly affects your score for class participation. As one
day of class is the equivalent of a week and a half during a full semester,
students with more than one absence will not earn a grade higher than "B." One
bonus point is awarded to students with perfect attendance (every class for
the full class period) and adequate participation.

>

> In order to fully participate in class, you are expected to do all assigned
readings **prior** to class. Additional readings may be placed on closed and
electronic reserve throughout the semester. There is a substantial amount of
reading for this course. To accomplish all of it, you will need to plan your
schedule carefully.

>

> Period, unannounced, in-class "minute papers" will be short writing
assignments based on readings for the week. They are conceptual in nature and
require you to pull from the readings.

>

> **Chapter Notes**  
>  It is expected that you invest yourself in the literature. However, to
assist one another in with the textbook, each student will select 1-2 chapters
(to be determined in class) and bring a **one page** summary for all class
members. The handout should include the APA citation for book chapters (please
include the chapter NUMBER on your handout) and a brief outline with major
points of the chapter. Follow the headings of the chapter to organize your
notes. Again, this does not excuse others from reading the chapters but will
serve as a useful reference. Notes are due the week prior to the chapter being
assigned for class. In this way, class members can use the notes as a guide
and fill in additional information as they read.

>

> **Exam Questions**  
>  For each Kaplin and Lee chapter assigned for reading, submit two multiple
choice exam questions with four options for answers. (You may not use "all of
the above" or "none of the above" as options.) Include the answer and page
number(s).

>

> These questions should be e-mailed to me at
[mwilson@ra.msstate.edu](mailto:mwilson@ra.msstate.edu) by 8:00 a.m. on the
day of class. Please use this subject line: _Legal questions for Chapter
[insert #]._

>

> Please follow this format for questions:

>

>> Which of the following is an internal source of law?  
> Academic custom and usage  
> Administrative rules and regulations  
> State common law  
> Statutes  
> Answer: Academic custom and usage, p. 17-18

>

> NOTE:  
> *4 choices (without "all of the above" or "none of the above")  
> *Options are not numbered, lettered, or indented  
> *Answer and page number included at the _end_ of the options  
>  *No typographical or grammatical errors

>

> **Exams**  
>  There will be two in-class exams. Questions from the students and the
instructor will appear on both exams. A study guide will be provided.

>

> **Research Paper and Presentation**  
>  Research a topic of interest to you and prepare a 8-10 page paper in which
you address the following issues:  
> 1.) Identify the problem or issue.  
> 2.) Identify and discuss relevant legal issues pertaining to the problem.
Your paper must cite relevant legal cases which guide your decision making.  
> 3.) Develop a strategy for addressing the issue in student affairs,
explaining what elements are most important in a sound, legal approach to the
issue.  
> 4.) Prepare a 30 minute presentation on your topic and facilitate class
discussion.

>

> We will select topics in class to avoid duplication for presentation
purposes. Suggested topics include:  
> academic dishonesty  
> admissions  
> affirmative action  
> campus violence  
> desegregation  
> fraternities and sororities  
> freedom of association  
> funding of student activities  
> hate speech  
> hazing  
> liability  
> sexual assault  
> sexual harassment  
> single-gender institutions  
> student press  
> student discipline  
> student records

**A word about due dates:** In a compressed class such as this, it is
difficult to spread out the due dates for assignments to allow enough time to
complete them and also to receive feedback throughout the course. Some
students are concerned that so much of their grade is unknown until near the
end of the course. If this concerns you, you may submit assignments early and
will receive prompt feedback.

**_Academic Integrity_ :**  
You will be held accountable to the highest standards for academic integrity
and should read and understand the policy on academic integrity as printed in
MSU's Graduate School Bulletin. Please note that without prior approval, you
may not submit an assignment for this class that has been previously submitted
for another course. All ideas that are not your own must be properly cited.
See <http://www.msstate.edu/dept/students/amcsanct.htm> for additional
information.

**_Assumptions:_**  
I am operating on the assumption that you want to gain the most you can from
your studies and will therefore invest yourself in readings and assignments
and come to every class prepared to engage fully. I trust you will work to
balance effectively your personal, academic, and professional commitments. I
assume you take responsibility for your own learning and will also contribute
to others' learning. What you gain from this experience is in direct
correlation to what you invest in it.

You may assume that I care deeply about your success--personally,
academically, and professionally; want you to gain the most possible from this
experience; am committed to my role in this venture; want to hear your
experiences, ideas, and feedback; and will hold you accountable to high (and
reasonable) academic standards.

**_E-mail Account:_**  
If you do not already have an active e-mail account, please have one activated
prior to the second class meeting. Announcements and readings will be
distributed via e-mail. Please check your account regularly.

**_Students with Disabilities:_**  
If you have a documented disability, are registered with Student Support
Services, and are entitled to accommodations, please inform me.

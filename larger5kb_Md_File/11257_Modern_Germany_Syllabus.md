**Course Description and Objectives**  
This seminar on Germany in the twentieth century will explore in depth the
inter-related topics of the so-called German Question: who are the Germans,
what are their geographical boundaries, and what kind of government will they
have.  We will begin with a general historical survey and explore these topics
at the level of high political power as well as the level of daily life for
individuals from all social levels and genders.  As we learn about modern
Germany, we will be striving toward a secondary primary goal of learning the
principles of scholarly writing.  You will learn to think strategically about
sources and arguments, develop the ability to use both primary and secondary
sources, distinguish key issues from lesser subordinate points, and develop
and present a thesis argument convincingly.

**Course Requirements**  
Students are required to read the assigned selections from three monographs,
attend class, and participate in class discussions.  Readings must be done in
advance of class; seminar discussions will require students to pay attention
and take notes while reading.  Each week students will introduce the reading
at the outset of class discussion.  You will be graded not only on whether you
attend and participate in seminar discussions, but also on the quality of your
contributions.  For your research papers you will also be required to do
substantial additional reading on a topic of your choice.  Students are
encouraged to write their research papers on either the Nazi period or German
unification.

In addition, individual meetings without the professor, as well as individual
presentations to the class, are important parts of the seminar.  during the
semester, you will be responsible for two oral presentations of your research
for the paper.  These 'progress paper reports' will be 10 to 15 minutes long.
You will present, on your topic of choice, a general explication of your
research progress and preliminary hypotheses.  Those who are not presenting
will write 'peer evaluations' suggesting how the presenting colleague's paper
could be improved.  You will also submit your first progress papers including
a working bibliography and footnotes _in writing_ to the professor.
Following these progress reports a detailed outline is required, in order to
ensure that you are properly organizing you findings and argument.  In
addition, a draft of your research paper either a completed or nearly
completed papers mandatory, along with the second oral progress report.

Your final paper will follow from your progress reports outline, so it will be
very well polished.  All citations must be properly made in footnotes, and you
must include a complete bibliography.  The final paper will be a minimum of
fifteen and a maximum of twenty pages in length (not including the
bibliography).  Late submission of oral and written work will not be
acceptable, except for good reasons and on condition that the student requests
an extension at least 24 hours in advance.

class description: In this class, we will study contemporary life in the U.S.
from an anthropological perspective highlighting connections and
discontinuities in race, gender, class and culture as they unfold historically
from the 19th century to an imagined future in the 21st.  Our synecdoche for
the U.S. during this challenging period will be the city, for it is there, in
the tradition of John Winthrop's "Citty upon a Hill," that the inequalities
and injustices of U.S. society are thrown into bold relief.  But we won't stop
there: cities are "networked" to countless other sites through media,
migration and politics to other places, other identities and other realities.
One of our goals, therefore, will be to follow the "U.S." into its
international peregrinations as "global culture" and "network society."  Even
people living far afield from the (territorial) U.S. may know a good deal more
of this country than they bargained for: McDonald's, Hollywood and the U.S.
military are ubiquitous reminders that we cannot consider the U.S. out of a
global context of power and history.

The penumbra for this critical analysis of the "Citty" will be the future, a
favorite trope of politicians and advertising agencies everywhere, to be sure,
but vital to our understanding of a 21st century U.S. when future imaginaries
condition the present in ways both horribly confining and (occasionally)
liberating.  By comparing and critically examining these frequently
disingenuous constructions of future spaces and identities, we can begin to
understand the present as fundamentally contested.  
We enter into this discussion through the eyes of immigrants amidst the
dystopian spaces of Los Angeles in the wake of the 1992 riots.  From their
experiences of race and inequality--tragically concretized in the 1992
uprising--we will learn something of the U.S. city as a site of continuing,
institutional inequality and, in many ways, a scapegoat for the racism still
at the core of contemporary life in the United States.  From there, we swing
to the utopian spaces of science and information society through an
ethnography of "artificial life."  Do these new forms of being offer a way out
of the dilemmas of 21st century society, or do they compound them, imbricating
possible futures?  Finally, we turn to the city as an imagined space combining
all of those hopes and fears.  By examining an SF novel--Snowcrash--and by
engaging in a simulation of city building--SimCity--we may be able to sketch
the interpenetrating boundaries of identity, space and technology that
condition 21st century life in the United States.  It is my hope that we can
transform these visions of a dystopian and bounded future into some ideas of
what a just, peaceful and interesting 21st century might look like.  
    
In a class on culture and society in the U.S., everyone is a potential expert.
I therefore expect the highest level of participation from all of you as we
attempt to come to grips with these manifold issues.

graded assignments:

attendance  
Attendance in this course is required.  Here's how it works: students begin  
the course with an "A" in attendance but, for each class missed, lose a "grade  
step" (e.g., A to A-, A- to B+).  However: each student can miss two "grace  
classes" before being penalized.

homework  
At various moments throughout the semester, I will assign homework based on  
class readings, films or special discussions.  Students may complete the
homework  
for credit on the midterm or final examination.

midterm exam  
The midterm exam will test both your knowledge and understanding with a  
battery of multiple choice, "True-False" and short answer questions.

final exam The final exam will test your intellectual probity through an in-
class essay.

    
final project and report: SimCity and digital worlds  
(2 pages) Students will run the urban planning simulation for at least 6 hours  
and report on 1) the shape of their >city= and 2) the biases inherent in the  
SimCity simulation.

notes

1.  Although exams and graded work will remain as stated above, I may have to change different readings or films on the syllabus throughout the semester.  I will, in any case, try to give you ample warning of any syllabus changes. 

2\. Each student is required to sign a contract indicating his/her
understanding of the University=s rules regarding cheating and plagiarism
(Towson University Undergraduate Catalog, Appendix F).  Neither will be
tolerated in my class and will result in a flunking grade.

3\. Students with learning disabilities should register at the Disability
Support Services Office.  


explanation of grading  
Following department policy, students will be assigned a letter grade without
a qualifying A+@ or A-@.

A: A superior performance surpassing assigned work in unique and novel ways
and  
integrating diverse ideas from a wide range of sources in addition to those
discussed in  
    
class.

B: Excellent work surpassing the expectations of the assignment and
demonstrating initiative  
and a willingness to move beyond the basic requirements of the assigned work.

C: Satisfactory work meeting all basic requirements of the assignment.

D: Work in some way less than satisfactory.  Although conforming to basic
requirements in  
some way, the completed work is nevertheless not a coherent response to the  
assignment.

F: A profoundly unsatisfactory performance which doesn't meet  
the intent of the assignment at any level.

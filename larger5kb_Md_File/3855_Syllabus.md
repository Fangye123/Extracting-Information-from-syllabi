**If in order to learn you need to be externally motivated, need to be
challenged in order to get things done, study only under the pressure of
teachers and examinations, love the human and traditional teacher-student
classroom interaction, and/or   hate computers, then this web based course is
not for you. On the other hand, if you like to learn at your own pace, if you
are self motivated, find the traditional classroom instruction rigid, would
like to learn while surfing the net, have minimal internet skills, want to
take a college class at the privacy of your home, and like a flexible course
schedule, then this course is for you. **

**COURSE DESCRIPTION** | **An examination of the theoretical systems of
psychology in historical perspective and in the context of the attempt to
understand human nature and the problem of method in the philosophy of
science.**

 **Two types of questions will be continuously asked throughout the course.
The first is related to the problem of method (have the human sciences
imitated the methods of the natural sciences or have they developed unique
methods). The second question relates to how meta-scientific views of human
nature, helped shape the formulation and development of theories in
psychology. An attempt will be made to relate the history of psychology to the
history of science and European intellectual history.**

**OBJECTIVES & OUTCOMES** | **We all during the course of life ask ourselves,
"what is human nature?" The course focuses on how thinkers throughout history
have dealt with this perplexing question. Although the course does not supply
a clear-cut answer on what human nature truly is, it nevertheless enhances the
student's knowledge of psychology by providing an historical perspective of
the attempt to understand human nature and the methods used to do it.**

 **The goal of the course is twofold: to enrich the students' knowledge of the
history of psychology and   help them formulate their own understanding of
human nature.**

**More specifically the course aims, (1) to introduce students to the
historical foundations of   contemporary psychology; (2) to develop in
students an understanding of the major theoretical positions in psychology;
(3) to enhance students' skills in thinking critically about issues in
psychology; (4) to increase student's skills in writing tasks relevant to the
study of psychology; and, (5) to orient students to psychology as an
intellectual discipline and profession.**

**The expected outcomes are: (1) master the basic vocabulary of concepts used
by psychologists; (2) discuss fundamental theoretical issues of psychology in
an informed way; (3) understand the relation of theory and experimentation;
and (4) use writing as a tool to become more actively involved in the
student's own learning.**  
**COURSE ORGANIZATION** | **As a web based course students meet and do all
course work in virtual space. Anyone anywhere in the world with a reliable
internet connection and minimal internet knowledge can enroll in this course.
There are no meetings in the traditional physical classroom. The course
utilizes the new technology of the information age in order to deliver and
improve upon traditional undergraduate education in history. It also seeks to
familiarize students with on-line communications and   introduce students to
the internet as a working environment and research tool.  **

**The course home page is the main entrance to the course facilities. Only
registered students with a valid userid/password can access the course home
page at  
[http://webct.courses.unt.edu/SCRIPT/HIST5000RD/scripts/serve_home](http://webct.courses.unt.edu/SCRIPT/HIST5040RD/scripts/serve_home).**

**The most important facilities of the course home page are: _Conference
Board_ , _Chat Room_ , _Student Reports_ , and _Module 1-17_. The other
facilities allow students to e-mail the instructor and WebCt technical
support, change password, and link with the virtual UNT Librarian, instructor
home page, course syllabus and a technical guide to WebCt. The _Calendar_
reminds students of the various stages, tasks and deadlines of the course.**

**The _Class Conference Board_ is the course's virtual classroom where
students and instructor meet regularly. It resembles a Usenet newsgroup though
technically much more sophisticated. It is divided into several forums (each
module has its own forum, for example). It allows students to post messages
and discuss with their peers and instructor course related matters. Students
are expected to read the Class Conference Board at least every other day.
Internet etiquette applies. Vigorous intellectual debate about course related
matters is expected.**

**The _Chat Room_. Participation in the chat room is not a course requirement.
It is a 24 hours   lounge where students can meet synchronously and "talk"
freely. In several rooms all chat is recorded. In other rooms, however, all
chat is erased as soon as students leave the room.**

**The facility, _Student Reports_ , archives students' surf-the-net reports
posted at the Class Board. Once students post a review at the Class Board it
is assumed that they automatically give permission to archive their work and
make it available to students of other sections of this course. Students who
do not wish to give this permission or who wish to keep their work anonymous
should notify the instructor during the first week of classes.**

**_Modules 1-17_ , introduce the student to the classic or basic knowledge of
the history of psychology. Those are the notes students should have written if
taking the traditional classroom delivery of this course. At the end of each
module  a "WWW Links" page lists names and topics related to the lecture
notes. Students are required to write a surf-the-net report discussing the
World Wide Web resources on the name or concept of their choice.**  
**DEADLINES** | **All work related to each module, including the module's exam
and surf-the-net reports, must be completed before the mid-term exam. After
that date previous modules will be closed and the next ones introduced. The
modules vary in size and it is assumed that a semester has 17 weeks (119
days).**

**REQUIREMENTS** | **Students are required:**

  * **to have minimal computer/internet skills (e.g, they must know how to e-mail, participate in an internet bulletin board and surf the net)**
  * **to study the web lectures notes of each of the modules**
  * **to write 15 surf-the-net reports out of the 17 modules and post them at the bulletin board**
  * **to discuss the reading of the textbook at the bulletin board**
  * **actively participate in course related discussions at the bulletin board**
  * **initiate e-mail exchanges with the instructor at least once per module**
  * **to take 3 exams (exams test knowledge of the lecture notes)**

**The course has 17 modules. Each module requires the student to complete the
following steps:**

  * **to read the lectures notes**
  * **to write 15 surf-the-net report around 1500 words each**
  * **to participate at the class conference board**
  * **to interact by e-mail with the instructor**
  * **to complete all work as scheduled**



| **Activity** | **Description** | **% of grade**  
---|---|---  
**Exams** | **There are three non-cumulative exams. Each exam is 10% of the
final grade. Exams test knowledge of the lecture notes.** | **30%**  
**Surf the net reports** | **Students surf the net and write a report (around
1500 words) about the net resources in the topic(s) of the module of their
choice.   Reports are  posted  at the class conference board.   15 reports.
Each is 3% of the final grade).** | **45%**  
**Participation** | **Students engage in meaningful discussions about the web
reports, course related topics and reading of the textbook at the class
conference board.** | **15%**  
**Contact** | **Students must initiate at least one e-mail exchange per module
with the instructor. Students are strongly encouraged to contact the
instructor at any time.** | **10%**  
**HOW TO TAKE EXAMS** | **All three exams are on-line. When students are ready
to take an exam's module they must e-mail   the teacher and request the
internet address of their exclusive exam web site. **

**Students should take the on-line exam in no more than 60 minutes.   They
should type the entering or beginning time in the first box and the exit time
at the end of the exam. The software also keeps the time students opened the
file and the time they submit the file. A discrepancy between their time of
entry and exit and the machine time record greater then 5 minutes will
automatically invalidate the exam. Divide your time wisely by not dedicating
more than one  third (20 minutes) of the total exam time (60 minutes) to each
section of the exam.**

**Students are allowed to open the web exam file only once, e.g., they are
allowed to take the exam only once. There is a counter at the end of the exam.
It should read 1. If you exit and re-open the file the counter will list a 2,
meaning that the file was opened twice. Any number rather then a 1 at the
counter will automatically invalidate the exam.   **

**In the multiple choice exam click on the right answer's button. If you
change your mind clicking at another option will erase the first choice.   In
the identification section of the exam type the id and your answer to each of
the three ids in the separate answering boxes. Write your choice of essay exam
(e.g., type the essay question) and your answer in the appropriate box.**

**The ids and essay exams answering boxes have a maximum of 65 characters per
line. Do not exceed that number of characters by entering a line break and
starting a new line.**

**You will find an exact copy of these instructions in a box at the top of the
exam. Skip it and go straight to the exam so that you will not waste time re-
reading instructions. Remember, your exam will be invalidated if you take more
than 60 minutes time to complete it and/or open the exam site more than
once.**  
**TEXTBOOK** |

  * **Leslie F. Stevenson, _Seven Theories of Human Nature_ (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1974).**

  
**SPECIAL ACCOMMODATIONS** | **Any  person with special circumstances covered
by  the American with Disabilities Act should register with the office of
Disability Accommodation, Suite 318A, University Union Building, and also
inform the instructor of  this class. Reasonable adjustment will be made to
accommodate the special needs of students with disabilities where such
adjustments are necessary to provide equality of educational access**.  
**CONFERENCE BOARD** | **Participation at the class conference or bulletin
board is a pre-requisite for the completion of this course and 20% of the
final grade.   All surf-the-net reports will be posted at the class conference
board. Students are expected to engage in meaningful discussions, criticism
and commentaries of  their peers'  net reports and any other course related
(and also not so related)  topic, including discussions about the textbook.
Internet etiquette should be followed. **  
**SURF-THE-NET REPORT** | **By taking this course students are participating
at a very unique pedagogical experiment. There are no precedents for the
"surf-the-net report." It replaces the old book or library report but because
of the nature of the medium it should have its own distinctive features. The
nature, scope and format of "surf-the-net reports" should be the first topic
of discussion at the Class Conference Board. Students should introduce
themselves  to the Board as soon as they are officially enrolled in this
course and their first posting should delineate their views of such reports. I
expect vigorous debate at the Board not only about the intellectual content of
the reports but also the nature, scope and format of academic "surf-the-net
reports." **

 **At the end of each module a "WWW Links" home page lists names and topics
related to the lecture notes. Students are required to write the surf-the-net
report discussing the World Wide Web resources on the name or concept of their
choice. "First come, first serve" policy observed in order to prevent multiple
reports on the same item. Students should post their claim over a concept or
name in the Class Board. The report should also be posted at the Class
Conference Board and will be archived at the facility Student Reports. **

**It is assumed that students give permission to archive their work and make
it available to students of other sections of this course. Students who do not
wish to give this permission or who wish to keep their work anonymous should
notify the instructor during the first week of classes.**

**Please note that this is a web report (just like the old library or book
report) not a mere listing of web sites. Your report can be topic or site
centered. A topical report discusses various web sites with information about
a specific topic. A site centered report rather focuses on one specific site
that specializes in the topic of your choice. Both types of reports should
examine the site's content, appearance, structure and any other relevant
feature.**

**The length of each report should be around 1500 words.**  
**E-MAIL   YOUR TEACHER** | **Students are encouraged to initiate e-mail
exchange with their teacher as often as possible. They must report to the
teacher by e-mail about their progress at least once per module. E-mail
contact with the instructor is 10% of the total grade. When ready to take an
exam students must   request from their teacher their exam's  web address. Dr.
deCarvalho's  e-mail address is: [roy@unt.edu](mailto:roy@unt.edu).**

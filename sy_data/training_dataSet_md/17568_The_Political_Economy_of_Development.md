### The Political Economy of Development (POLI 464)

### ![](Images/rainbow.GIF)

Strong economic performance has become an important goal for many nations.
Despite attempts to achieve long-term economic growth, it has evaded many
countries. Some economies have grown rapidly over the last 30 years, while
others have languished, subjecting a large portion of their populations to
grinding poverty. What explains this wide variance in economic performance?
Economists have as yet only explained roughly half of the variance. Having
recognized that traditional models only account for half of the variance,
research is now beginning to center on political factors. This class explores
both the theory and empirical evidence that connects politics to economic
development.

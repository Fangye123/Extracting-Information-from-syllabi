******Ethnic Studies 200B class syllabus  
Winter 2002**  
Theories and Methods of Ethnic Studies **  
Dr. George Lipsitz**  
  
**Aims**  
In this course we will explore the theories and methods favored by
contemporary researchers in Ethnic Studies across the disciplines. Our aims
are to develop an inventory of approaches, to see how different disciplinary
contexts both enable and inhibit ethnic studies, and to learn how new social
relations are challenging traditional ways of knowing.  
**Assignments**  
Each week, every student will write a two-page paper (about 500 words) on the
book assigned for that week. The paper should identify the book is research
object and its research question. It should identify the disciplinary
context(s) from which the book emerges and explain how that context shapes
choices about evidence and argument. Finally, the paper should identify the
original and generative contribution that the book makes to ethnic studies
scholarship.

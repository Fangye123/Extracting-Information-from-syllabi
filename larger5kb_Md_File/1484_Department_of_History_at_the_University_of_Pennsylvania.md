**Purpose of Course:**  
This course examines the process of industrialization from a comparative
perspective and integrates the history of industrialization and its social
consequences for Western Europe (Britain and Germany), the United States,
Latin America (Mexico), East Asia (Japan, South Korea, Taiwan), and lastly,
the first stirrings of industrialism and protest in China. The course is
designed to introduce students to the salient, and varied, interpretations
surrounding the industrialization process.

We will concentrate on the important transition period in which these
countries moved away from an agriculturally-based society toward an industrial
society. What exactly is industrialization and how has the industrialization
process changed (and not changed) in the last two centuries? By comparing this
period cross-nationally and across time we will be able to engage such
questions as the nature and speed of economic growth, the role of the state
and national industrial policy, the sources of finance, the diffusion of
technology and knowledge, the role of labor and class politics, the impact of
economic change on peoples work lives, the role of culture, and, especially,
the impact of late development.

In this course, we will analyze the process of industrialization on two levels
--from above and from below. The history from above will tend to focus on the
role of the state. Can a state guide industrialization and develop a country?
Is it necessary under conditions of backwardness or late development to have a
strong state? Would increasing the play of free market forces enhance economic
growth? In particular, the post-WWII successes of Japan and the four dragons
of East Asia have become the subject of recent controversies.

From below, the course offers a view of factory life, industrial relations,
and protest from the perspective of workers and the working classes. The
wrenching transition away from agricultural life to factory life engendered
considerable resistance and challenges by labor. Of special interest is the
role of women at work, and the intersection of gender and class around the new
factories and on the shop floor. To the present day, industrial development
usually begins with the employment of women in textiles. By examining womens
work in factories, we can gain an invaluable perspective on industrialization
and working class life. Are women more integrated into a societys political
economy? Or made more marginal? Or are they simply exploited as a low-wage
proletariat?

**Course Requirements:**

1) The course is organized primarily as a series of _discussion_ sessions.
Discussion and participation in the weekly meetings is the number one priority
and is weighted accordingly (40% of the final grade).

2) For at least one seminar meeting, one student will prepare a brief
presentation based on one of the suggested supplementary readings to open the
discussion. The presentation should outline the readings major arguments and
draw some implications for understanding the sessions reading. The presenter
will then start the class discussion by raising some critical points or
questions about the joint reading. At the end of your presentation, hand out a
two-page synopsis/review of your day's reading to the other students in the
class. You are not expected to lead the whole discussion, just to open it with
some good questions. The presentation should last no longer than 20 minutes
and be clear. Remember you are talking to your peers.

3) Topics and a brief bibliography are due **March 19**. Supply a few
paragraphs on the issues you would like to engage and your potential approach.
You can write on any theme you would like. The only requirement is that the
topic be _comparative_ (at least two countries). I urge you to come to my
office hours or make an appointment to speak with me about your project. I
will also gladly read and comment on rough drafts. It can only help. Final
papers (roughly 15-20 pages) are due by **May 5**.

**Grading Weights:**  
40% based on class discussion/participation and papers on seminar readings;  
10% based on the quality of your oral presentation;  
50% based on term paper.

**I encourage you to make use of my office hours, especially if you are having
difficulty understanding the material, if you are unsure of what is expected
of you, or if you would like additional resources for a topic you find
interesting. Try to do this well before the exams and paper due-dates, as this
is usually much more enjoyable and productive for everybody involved. Please
come to office hours after you have done the reading and consulted the study
guide, and with as specific questions as you can.**

  **COURSE DESCRIPTION** **AND OBJECTIVES**  
---  
  
**This course introduces students to Greco-Roman literature and literary
genres, social and political institutions, and philosophical concepts of
ethics and education that have contributed to European thought and continue to
influence contemporary debate in American society. Core Studies 1 offers
practice in close reading and in communication by means of critical writing,
class discussion, and other methods such as collaborative group work..**

**Core Studies 1 aims to help students achieve the following goals:**

  * **to read Greek and Roman literary texts in English translation closely and critically**
  * **to understand these texts in their social, historical, material, and performance contexts**
  * **to relate the cultures that produced these texts to our contemporary culture in its diversity**
  * **to speak and write clearly and coherently about the issues that emerge from critical reading and comparison of cultures.** 

**To the end of accomplishing these objectives, we will work together to
create a community of learning and intellectual debate. With a view to
fostering this community**

  * **there are no free rides; everyone does the reading and everyone contributes to discussion;**
  * **you are responsible for mastering the content of the reading assignment before you come to class (for help with reading for comprehension, use Study Guide, core tutors, self tests online); I will lead us in devising strategies for critical interpretation;**
  * **do not disrupt the learning environment by tardiness, leaving cell phones or pagers on, carrying on private conversations during class, or through academic dishonesty.** 

**WARNING: this class is not a float; you will have to work hard and engage
texts and discussion aggressively; you must plan on 2 hours of prime study
time out of class for every hour in class. Your effort will be richly
rewarded.**

**TEXTBOOKS: you should purchase all of the following books at the beginning
of the semester; please do not use another translation of the texts.**

  **REQUIREMENTS:**  
---  
  
  **1) Attendance and participation:**

  * **The course will be conducted as a combination of lecture and discussion, therefore regular attendance and active participation is expected of every member of the class. You should do the reading assigned for each day PRIOR TO the class meeting and be prepared to contribute to lively discussion and intellectual debate. You will be expected to take responsibility for your own learning and for contributing in a meaningful way to the community of learning.**
  * **We will discuss specific passages from the readings, so bring the appropriate text to class every day..**
  * **You are responsible for everything said and done in each class. If you must be absent, be sure to get notes and find out what happened in class from a fellow-student.**
  * **No conduct that disrupts the learning environment will be tolerated. You should take this admonition seriously. Excessive absences, tardiness, or lack of preparation will be penalized in the final grade at the professor's discretion.** 
  
  
  **2) Quizzes and exams:**

  * **I will give regular and unannounced quizzes on the content of the reading for the day (20%). Quizzes may not be made up; however, the lowest quiz grade will be dropped.**
  * **There will be a mid-term (25%) and a final (25%). The mid-term and final may be made up only with appropriate documentation that the absence was beyond the student's control (e.g., physician's release form, obituary) NB: oversleeping, too much work in another class, etc. are not adequate justification for missing an exam and will not result in a make-up opportunity.** 
  
  
  **3) Writing assignments:**

**Three writing assignments are required:**

  * **a diagnostic in class writing assignment that will not be graded: This writing assignment IS a requirement and may not be made up apart from prior negotiation; if it is not turned in it WILL be counted as a 0 that may not be dropped and will be figured into the final grade.**
  * **two longer papers (15% each): Topics will be announced in class.** 

**Consult course schedule for due dates; note that papers are due AT THE
BEGINNING OF CLASS. NB: I do not accept late papers apart from prior
negotiation.**

**All essays written outside of class must be independently researched and
typewritten or computer-processed.**

**The Brooklyn College Learning Center (1300 Boylan Hall) provides trained
tutors to assist students needing help with their writing assignments, by
appointment only.**  
  
**4) Extra-Credit Option:**

  * **Students may earn 5 points on the final exam, by visiting the Greek Galleries at the MMA with the professor (at least two dates will be offered) or by attending a designated lecture in the Classics (date, time, and topic of the lecture will be announced each semester).**
  * **NB: Although you may attend as many of the additional opportunities as you wish, only one will count toward extra credit, that is, you will not earn more extra-credit points by attending more than one event.**

  **POLICY ON ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**  
---  
  
 I adhere rigorously to the Brooklyn College policy on academic integrity.
Students who cheat on quizzes or exams or who plagiarize material for papers
will receive automatice failure (0%) on the quiz, test, or paper and will be
reported to the office of Student Affairs.  
  
**"Academic dishonesty of any type, including cheating and plagiarism, is
unacceptable at Brooklyn College. Cheating is any misrepresentation in
academic work. Plagiarism is the representation of another person's work,
words, or ideas as your own. Students should consult the Brooklyn College
Student handbook for a fuller, more specific discussion of related academic
integrity standards. . . . Academic dishonesty is punishable by failure of the
test, examination, term paper, or other assignment on which cheating
occurred."** ( _Brooklyn College Bulletin_ , 58)

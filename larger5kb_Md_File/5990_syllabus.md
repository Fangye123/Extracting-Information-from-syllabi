******Required Texts:**

****_Programming and Problem Solving with C++_ by N. Dale, C. Weems, and M.
Headington, D.C. Heath and Company, 1996.` `

_A Laboratory Course in C++_ by N. Dale, Jones and Bartlett Publishers, 1997.`
`

**Optional Texts:**

****_C: How to Program_ by H. Deitel and P. Deitel, 2nd edition, Prentice
Hall, 1994.` `

**Objectives**

****This is a first course in computer science and is intended to provide a
rigorous introduction to problem solving and algorithm development using the
programming language C++. After completing this course, the student should be
able to understand and carry out the steps involved in solving a problem using
a computer, including the analysis, design, implementation, documentation, and
testing phase. The student should also be proficient with the programming
environment and understand the system hardware and software aspects of program
translation.

**Course Arrangement**

****The course is arranged on a lecture-laboratory basis. During a regular
15-week semester there will be three lecture sessions and one laboratory
session per week. The three lectures (on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of each
week) will be common for all students. The laboratory session (on Thursday)
will be held on a small group basis and will be taught by one of the teaching
assistants assigned to the course. Questions are encouraged in both the
lecture and laboratory Sessions.

**Course Policies**

****_Class Attendance_ : Regular attendance is highly recommended. If you miss
a class, you are responsible for all material covered or assigned in class.` `

_Lab Assignments_ : The laboratory is a mandatory part of the class. During
each lab meeting students will work individually to solve a set of problems
using the computer. Before each lab session, you must have completed the "pre-
lab" part of the laboratory and you must have read the "in-lab" part.` ` A
tentative schedule of the lab assignments can be downloaded from the course's
homepage. You will be instructed by the Teaching Assistants as how to submit
your solutions to the lab assignments for grading. **No late labs will be
accepted and the grade for a late lab will be zero.**

_Programming Project_ : A programming project will be assigned 2 1/2 weeks
before the end of classes. It will count as 3 labs and it will be graded on
correctness, style, and documentation. Late programming assignments will not
be accepted.` `

_Quizzes_ : There will be short quizzes in class. These will be announced at
least one class period in advance. There will be no make-ups for missed
quizzes.` `

_Exams_ : There will be two exams and a final. All exams will be closed books,
closed notes. If you are unable to attend an exam _you must inform me in
advance_. **No incomplete grades (INC) will be given in this course and a
missed exam may be made up only if it was missed due to an extreme
emergency.**

_General Comments_ : Since the material in this course is highly integrated, a
limited understanding of one topic will have a serious effect on the
understanding of subsequent topics. You should expect to spend many hours on
this course outside the classroom. Do not expect to fully understand the
material covered in this class if you do not spend many hours in front of your
computer. The first few lab assignments may seem easy but take longer than you
think. Also, the assignments get harder as the semester progresses. Don't get
behind in the lab assignments !!! Probably the main reason for students doing
poorly in this course is because they get behind in the lab assignments and
never recover.` `

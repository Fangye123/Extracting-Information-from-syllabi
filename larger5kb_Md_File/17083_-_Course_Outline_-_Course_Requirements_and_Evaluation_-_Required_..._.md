**COURSE OUTLINE**  

* * *

  
In the book African Fractals, the author noted that fractal geometry has
emerged as one of the most exciting frontiers in the relationship between
mathematics and information technology. Yet, while there is now the
understanding that fractal geometry can take us into the far reaches of
"modern computing," its patterns are common in African design and some of its
basic concepts are fundamental to African knowledge systems. What has been
understood in the fields of the natural sciences has not yet been grasped in
the social sciences. The importance of the knowledge economy in the 21st
century has inspired new investigations into the importance of African
knowledge for alternative forms of political associations. One of the many
challenges for us is to grasp how alternative approaches to knowledge can open
new directions in the study of African politics. How are symbols and
divination processes linked to a cosmology that influenced social and
political relations? In what ways was the palaver a reflection of dem ocratic
relations in the village community? How did the matricentric production unit
guarantee the autonomy of women? These questions arise in the present period
as African scientists; activists, intellectuals and ordinary producers seek
the ideas and organization necessary to break from Eurocentrism in order to
develop new concepts of politics and community.  
  
The objective of the course is to seek to understand the foundations of
politics in Africa. The focus will be to bring to life the humanity of the
African peoples and to understand the ideation system and social processes
that had evolved in the process of developing a **_Healing Spirit_**. There
will be an examination of the European ideation system that is rooted in
concepts of the enlightenment and modernity. In so far as the principal
theoreticians of Modern Political Thought developed the ideas of citizenship
and the state in the era of the victory of patriarchy, there will be an
examination of the relationship between the ideas of the enlightenment and
contemporary social and economic devastation of Africa. The core ideas of the
enlightenment will be interrogated in relation to the environmental
destruction, the politics of underdevelopment, and the traditions of
militarism, war and genocide. The text, **_King Leopold's Ghost_** will be the
main text to underline the ideas and practices that emanated from "the
imperialist partitioning of Africa." Is there a common thread linking the
ideas of King Leopold and Cecil Rhodes to the **_Assassination of Patrice
Lumumba_** up to the genocidal wars in central Africa? In seeking to answer
this question the relationship between militarism, fascism and masculinity
will also be studied  
  
In the quest to develop new democratic theories out of the quagmire of the
debt crisis and warfare the intervention of African feminists will assist us
to understand the new terrain of politics. The books of Ifi Amadiume,
**_Daughters of the Goddess: Daughters of Imperialism_** and **_Male
Daughters, Female Husbands_**. and Nawal El Sadawi, **_Woman at Point Zero_**
will be the core texts used for us to collectively learn from the struggles
for democratic gender relations. In the process of elaborating new concepts of
collective rights and democracy, the course will examine the limitations of
the patriarchal model of liberation.  
  
Because there are 54 states on the continent it would be unrealistic to cover
this vast continent in one semester. Thus, the emphasis of the course will be
on theme and methodological tools, which would sharpen our analytical skills.
Students are encouraged to use their term paper to focus on one society.  
  
The lectures and visual presentations will draw from the material and
intellectual culture of the region to provide an understanding of the dynamic
of the societies.

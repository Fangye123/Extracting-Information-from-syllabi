.   **THE COURSE.  ** During this semester, we will study the development of
western civilization from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern farming
villages more than 10,000 years ago to the opulent Hellenistic civilization
fostered by the conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when
humankind emerged from cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to
build cities, and to devise the complex system of social relationships we call
civilization. We will see how the invention of writing allows us to observe
the systems of government, society, and laws of the ancients. We will note the
formation of states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that recurs with
infinite variations throughout the brief period of humankind's recorded
history. There will also be a strong emphasis on the art and archaeology of
the ancient world--the physical and visual evidence which each civilization
has left behind--and what they tell us about that society's tastes and
beliefs.  Due to the span of time we examine, we will be moving quickly from
one period to another, and covering numerous unusual names and terms. The
effect may at times be confusing.  Ask questions...let me know what is
baffling or overwhelming.  The ancient world is at once familiar and
mysterious, the gaps in our knowledge of it present many puzzles, but also
allow for broad interpretation. I hope that this course will get you to think
and to analyze, to question "facts" and to develop your own opinions, for
these are the true benefits of studying history.     **This course satisfies
the General Education requirement in Historical Perspectives.**  
---  
.   **THE BOOKS.  ** Our basic modern texts for this course are:  
**_     Knapp = _**A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western
Asia & Egypt. _4th ed., Chicago, 1988.  
**_     Martin = _** __ Thomas Martin. _Ancient Greece.   _Yale Univ. Press.
1996.  
We will also examine original sources from:  
**_     Bailkey = _**N.M. Bailkey. _Readings in Ancient History._ Lexington,
Mass. 5th ed., 1996.  
---  
.   **INTERNET RESOURCES:** During this semester you should become familiar
with the course Web Page (
**http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_02s.htm** ).  The syllabus,
supplementary readings, study aids, and study guides for the exams will be
posted on the web page.  In general, I will also use the web page to
communicate with you between classes and to post extra credit opportunities
and changes in the course schedule and assignments.  Check the course web page
regularly for updates.  Bookmark it!  
---  
.   **REQUIREMENTS:** The course grade is based on a total of 200 points.
There will be **three exams**. Exam #1 =15% of your grade (30 points), Exam #2
=25% (50 points), Exam#3 =40% (80 points).   In order to "help" you keep up
with your reading assignments, there will be **brief quizzes** at the
beginning of selected class periods (roughly once a week). The quizzes will be
of a general nature and **will cover the reading assignment listed in the
syllabus (course schedule) _for that week._**   Quizzes and class
participation account for 20% of your course grade (40 points). Attendance
forms a significant portion of the grade and is a vital part of your
commitment to doing well in this course, as there are important concepts and
issues that will be presented only in class.  
---  
.   **POLICY ON MAKEUP EXAMS:** Students who miss an **exam** will be allowed
to make up the exam only if they provide the instructor with acceptable
documentation explaining their absence. The student must inform me _prior_ to
the time of the exam, unless extreme circumstances prevent this (you may do
this by e-mail or by leaving a voice-mail message at the above number,
specifically directed to me).   The makeup exam must be taken during the week
following the missed exam, except under extreme circumstances. Makeup exams
typically offer fewer options than regular exams.  **Quizzes** may be made up
with an excused absence, at the instructor's discretion.   To be eligible to
make up a quiz, or to have an absence excused, you should contact me
(preferably by email) as soon as possible and prior to your return to class.
You must take the quiz at the _beginning_ of the next class you attend (or by
prior arrangement).

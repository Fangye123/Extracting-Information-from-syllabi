**Fall 2001**

**History of Colonial America  
A history of French, Spanish, Dutch, and English colonization in North America
and the social, culture, military, political history of the English colonies.
**

**Required texts:  
Jerome R. Reich, _Colonial America_ , 5th edition  
Karen Kupperman, ed., _Major Problems in American Colonial History_ , 2nd
edition **

**The grade for each student will be determined as follows:  
20%     Midterm  
25%    Final  
30%    Research Paper (portion of this grade from the preliminary assignments)  
15%    Class participation  
10%    Class presentation  
**

**_COURSE STRUCTURE and CLASS PARTICIPATION_  
Discussion and dissection of assigned readings will serve as the center for
class meetings, so preparation, attendance, and participation in discussion is
mandatory.   Everyone must read all assignments for each day and be prepared
to participate in the discussion.  **

**Preparation:   Each student should read ALL reading assignments.  Below is a
schedule of which readings we will be discussing each class period.  Each
student must read the assignments prior to that class period and prepare to
participate in discussion by 1) thinking about the readings overall and 2)
writing 2 observations per class period that the student would like to make in
the course of class discussion.  Although these written observations will not
normally be turned in for a grade, I reserve the right to collect these
observations periodically and count them as part of a student's participation
grade. **

**Discussion:   We will conduct the class much like a seminar, wherein
discussion and dialogue rather than monologue and lecturing characterize the
class.  Student participation in discussion is REQUIRED and will figure as 10
percent of each student's final grade.  An exception to the rule of
participation will apply if any one or a small number of students begins, for
whatever reason, to monopolize student response.  Independent thinking is
highly encouraged as long as it is informed thinking--that is, thinking
informed by credible sources (your readings, for instance)--but especially as
long as diplomacy, respect, and tact govern its sharing and expression.  **

**Presentation:   Each student will also be assigned one day in which to bring
outside material to class to share with the other students.  This presentation
is designed to be informal.  **

**  Attendance:  Because the emphasis in this class is on collaborative
learning and discussion, attendance will count as part of the student's
participation grade.  Attendance on September 27 and November 15 is
absolutely, positively MANDATORY. _ _**

**_TESTS_  
There will be two tests: a midterm and the final exam.   The mid-term will
test all material in the first half of the course.  The final exam will test
the material in the last half of the course AND the major themes developed
throughout the entire semester.  **

**_RESEARCH PAPER_  
Students will work on a research paper throughout the course of the semester.
The final version of the paper is worth 25% of each student's final grade.
Another 5% of each student's grade will be based on the preliminary work on
the research paper. **

**Preliminary Work:   By September 25 each student should have a preliminary
topic for a research paper and will turn in their initial ideas (handwritten
acceptable).  Students may choose ANY topic having to do with Colonial
America, although we should try to limit the number of students working on any
one topic due to the limited resources. **

**Class on September 27 will be a workshop on how to write a HISTORY research
paper.   ATTENDANCE this day is MANDATORY.  Although we will be discussing our
papers the entire semester, this workshop will explain not only what is
expected from a history paper, but also what my particular expectations are.
**

**Students will turn in a very preliminary bibliography (handwritten
acceptable) on October 9.   This bibliography will serve three purposes: 1) a
preliminary idea of what sources are available on the chosen topic, 2) an
opportunity for me to guide each student towards other sources, and 3)
practice working with the _[Chicago Manual of
Style](http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/DocChicago.html)_ formats for
bibliographies.   Although primary sources would enhance any research paper,
they are not necessary for this term paper. **

**Each student will submit a 2-5 typed page proposal for his or her research
project no later than October 25.   This proposal should discuss the major
questions the student intends to answer in the final paper, the argument of
the final paper, and how the student intends to focus the paper.  Although it
might change before the final version, this proposal will resemble the
introduction to the research paper. **

**The bibliography will be due on November 6.   Of course, there will be some
room for revisions, but this should be very close to the final bibliography
for the paper. **

**Each student will have a completed 12-15 page research paper on November 15.
ATTENDANCE on this date is MANDATORY.  Students will exchange papers on this
date and offer written and oral suggestions and constructive criticism for
revising the papers. **

**The final version of the research paper is due no later than November 29.
It should be 11-15 pages typed (excluding bibliography) in a normal size font
with 1-inch margins.  **

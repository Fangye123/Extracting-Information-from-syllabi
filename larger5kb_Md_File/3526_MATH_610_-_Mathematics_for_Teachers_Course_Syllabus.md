**Course Description**  
The content of this course will focus on mathematics as problem solving,
mathematics as communication, mathematics as reasoning, and making
mathematical connections between different fields of mathematics, between
mathematics and other disciplines, and between school mathematics and real
world mathematics. Topics for discussions and activities will come from number
and number relationships, number systems and number theory, computation and
estimation, patterns and functions, statistics and probability, geometry and
measurement. Various technologies will be used in the course as they support
the teaching and learning of mathematics.  
  
**Course Objectives**  
By the conclusion of this course, a student should have new constructions in
both content knowledge (mathematics) and pedagogical content knowledge
(strategies for teaching mathematics). More specifically, a student should
have new constructions in:

(a) a knowledge of topics currently receiving increased attention as well as
those  
  
receiving decreased attention in mathematics;  
  
(b) a knowledge of and experiences with strategies for teaching specific
topics of  
  
mathematics content;  
  
(c) a knowledge of and experiences with innovative methodologies and
technologies;  
  
(d) a knowledge of resources available to teachers; and,

(e) a knowledge of innovative assessment strategies.  
  
**Reference Texts  
**_Curriculum and Evaluation Standards for School Mathematics

Calculus  
_ Professional journals including NCTM's _Teaching Children Mathematics,
Mathematics Teaching in the Middle School, Mathematics Teacher_ and the
_Journal for Research in Mathematics Education.  
_ Miscellaneous materials available at cost or on reserve at the library. MTSU

 74-83.9 |  C  
  
  
**Explanation of Course Requirements  
  
1\. Journal**  
  
I am asking you to keep a reflective/dialogue journal to be reviewed by me
approximately every two weeks. You will not be awarded points for your journal
because its intent is to provide an opportunity for professional growth via a
writing experience. You will be given time in class for writing and will be
asked to make entries outside class as you complete readings, prepare for
class, complete other course requirements, etc.  
  
**2\. Cooperative Group Learning Activities:** 10 @ 10 points  
  
During ten classes you will be given time to solve a problem as a group of
three or four. At the conclusion of the activity, each group will submit one
solution or report of the group's progress. Each person in the group will be
awarded the same number of points for the activity unless otherwise designated
by the group.  
  
**3\. Article critiques:** 5 @ 20 points  
  
Each student is asked to search the literature and read at least 5 articles
that are of professional interest and related to topics being discussed during
the semester. A written report will be submitted and evaluated. Each critique
must be typed/ word processed and should not exceed two pages. Single space
the reference listing at the top of the page with your name typed in the upper
right-hand corner. The reference should be written in APA style _(Publication
manual of the American Psychological Association,_ Fourth Edition). The body
of the paper must be double spaced. Each critique should be divided into two
sections. The first section, one or two paragraphs, should summarize the
article. Subtitle it **Summarv**. The second section, one or two paragraphs,
should be your reaction to what has been presented. Write this section in
first person. Subtitle these paragraphs **Reaction**. Following is an example
of a reference in APA style:  
  
Miller, L. D. (1992). Teacher benefits from using impromptu writing prompts in
algebra classes. _Journal for Research in Mathematics Education, 23 (4),_
329340.  
  





**4\. Peer sharing:** 50 points  
  
We will be covering several topics this semester which will reflect a blend of
content and pedagogy. Each student should seize upon the opportunity to share
with the class something that s/he believes is really neat and/or interesting.
I value each individual's participation in this class and want to provide the
opportunity and the time for you to learn from each other as well as from me.
I truly believe that a classroom is a  "community of learners" and hope that
this belief is exhibited throughout the semester.  
  
**5\. Final examination:** 100 points  
  
A written examination will be administered at the end of the course. It will
include both take-home and in-class items. Questions posed will reference
readings, in-class tasks, lectures, discussions, etc.  
  
**6\. Course project:** 100 points  
  
I want you to become the  "resident expert" on a topic as the semester
progresses and share your knowledge and expertise with the rest of the class.
The topic should be of interest to you and be related to a current or future
position. The topic might be broad in scope, e.g., "Multicultural and Gender
Equity in the Mathematics Classroom," or very focused, e.g., "Calculus By and
For Young People (ages 7, yes 7 and up)." I anticipate that your expertise
will be strengthened by reviewing the literature, through personal
experiences, and by talking with classmates, colleagues, students,
administrators, etc. This project will be evaluated by the instructor and
peers. Evaluation criteria will be disseminated at a later date.  
  
I would like for each person to talk to me, individually, about this course
requirement. I want to approve your topic, to avoid duplications, and review a
plan for your investigative procedures.

### Graduate Courses in European History

  
_Fall Semester, 1999_  
  
HIEU 503 GREECE IN THE FOURTH CENTURY  
[ Ms. Elizabeth Meyer](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/meyer.html)  
  
  
  
This is an advanced course in Greek history (in discussion-seminar format)
that examines in detail the period from the end of the Peloponnesian War in
404 B.C. to the defeat of the Greek city-states at Chaeronea in 338. It is
particularly concerned with the social and economic, as well as the political,
history of the fourth century; this means that the focus will be chiefly on
Athens rather than on the other city-states or the "nation-state" of Macedon.
The major aim of the class will be to write a twenty- to twenty-five page
research paper (to be submitted in draft first); in addition to this there
will be five two-page exercises on evidence and method due throughout the
term. The course fulfills the second writing requirement. Readings will be
drawn from the following:  Xenophon, _Hellenica_ , (A History of My Times),
trans. R. Warner)  
_Greek Political Oratory_ (trans. A.N.W. Saunders, Penguin, 1970)  
A.N. Saunders, ed. _Demosthenes and Aeschines_ (Penguin, 1975)  
P. Harding, _From the End of the Peloponnesian War to the Battle of Ipsos_
(sourcebook; Cambridge, 1985)  
J. Ober, _Mass and Elite in Classical Athens_ (Princeton, 1989)  
Plutarch, _The Rise and Fall of Athens_ and _The Age of Alexander_  
Aeneas Tacticus, _How to Survive Under Siege_ (trans. D. Whitehead, Oxford,
1990; recommended)  
Diodorus Siculus vols. 6 and 7 (Loeb; recommended)

HIEU 507 MODERN THEORY: MARX, ARENDT, FOUCAULT, SARTRE  
[ Mr. Allan Megill](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/megill.html)  
  
  
  
In this course we shall examine four major "modern" theorists, namely, Karl
Marx, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault. There is an
interesting contrast between Marx and the others, and one focus of the course
will be on exploring that contrast. Marx was still a believer in progress:
Arendt, Sartre, and Foucault, on the other hand, were "crisis thinkers," who
could no longer rely on "the firm basis of traditional values" (as Arendt put
it in 1946). Our modus operandi will be to combine a _very_ selective reading
in the secondary literature with readings of major works by each writer.
Characteristically, each week I shall begin by speaking for 20 minutes or so,
in an attempt to situate the reading for that week and to pose some
interesting issues. We shall then engage in discussion of the reading.
Students should have some background in political theory, intellectual
history, philosophy, or philosophically-oriented religious studies.  
  
The syllabus has not yet been set up; consequently, there is not yet a
definitive reading list. Works from which we shall likely read include Marx,
_Early Writings_ , Arendt, _Eichmann in Jerusalem_ and _The Human Condition_ ;
Foucault, _Essential Works_ , vol. 1; and Sartre, _Being and Nothingness_.
Students who are interested in the class might consider approaching me before
August and preferably before June (megill@virginia.edu); their conversations
with me might well have some effect on the syllabus, which I expect to revise
in early August.  
  
The course is intended to provide an opportunity for graduate students and
advanced undergraduates to explore one or another of these thinkers in depth.
Characteristically, the class is taken by students who would like to write a
fairly substantial paper on one of the four thinkers, or on some theme that
was important for one or more of them. Students write a 20-25 page paper; they
are also expected to do the reading, to contribute to discussion, to write up
class minutes on occasion, and to offer reports on their reading on occasion.  
  
HIEU 516 THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH  
[ Mr. Everett U. Crosby](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/crosby.html)  
  
  
  
A documentary history of the organized church in the Latin west from the
beginnings to the sixteenth century. The sources of the faith, liturgical
practice, the sacraments and the monopoly on salvation, heresy and
inquisition, the church as an economic enterprise, the religious orders,
episcopal government, papal monarchy, canon law, and ecclesiastical
architecture will be among the topics for reading and discussion.
Requirements: one essay on a subject related to the work of the course, and a
final examination. Open to undergraduates and graduate students. No
requisites.  
  
HIEU 530 NATIONALITY, ETHNICITY AND RACE IN 19TH- AND 20TH-CENTURY EUROPE  
[ Mr. Robert P. Geraci](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/geraci.html)  
  
  
  
In this seminar we will explore how Europeans have conceived, reified,
managed, and experienced categories of human identity for the past two
centuries. Insofar as we will be viewing these categories as originally
"imagined" or "constructed" we will examine the various materials that have
been used to define them and to bring them to life, including not only
politics also the sciences and culture. In turn, we will also be concerned
with the substantial power wielded by these categories in modern Europe -- in
the internal affairs of particular European societies, in relations and
rivalries among them, and in the management of multi-ethnic empires that
extended beyond Europe.  
  
Though we will focus primarily on England, France, Germany and Russia/USSR, we
will also include readings on other countries of Europe when possible. We will
attempt to establish patterns of difference and commonality across Europe in
the position and treatment of indigenous ethnic and confessional minorities
and of groups of non-European origin (as colonial subjects, immigrants, or
domestic minorities). We will address the latest historical scholarship and
conclude the seminar with material on present-day Europe. Major works included
in the syllabus are Liah Greenfeld, _Nationalism_ , Ivan Hannaford, _Race: The
History of an Idea in the West_ ; George Stocking, Jr., _Victorian
Anthropology_ ; Rogers Brubaker, _Citizenship and Nationhood in France and
Germany_ ; Alon Confino, _The Nation as Local Metaphor_ ; Robert Proctor,
_Racial Hygiene_ ; and Kathleen Paul, _Whitewashing Britain_. We will also
read shorter selections by scholars such as Stephen Jay Gould, Jacques Barzun,
Yuri Slezkine, Sander Gilman, and Ann Laura Stoler.  
  
Upperclass undergraduates as well as graduate students in history, the
humanities and the social sciences are encouraged to enroll. A basic knowledge
of European history is desirable but not required. Each student will be
required to submit several one- to two-page papers summarizing readings, and
to produce a historiographical essay of 15-20 pages.  
  
HIEU 558 THE BRITISH EMPIRE  
[ Mr. Richard Drayton](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/drayton.html)  
  
  
This is a seminar course which will examine the history of the British Empire,
from its foundations in the Seventeenth century to the era of Decolonization,
and including both its European center, and its American, Asian, African, and
Pacific peripheries. It aims to provide you with a mental map of the pattern
of British expansion over the long term, to introduce you to both old and new
historiographical approaches, and to the reading of primary sources. Your
grade will be based on your participation in the seminar, and on a 25-page
research paper. While there are no formal prerequisites, it is intended for
graduate and for advanced undergraduates who are ready to undertake work at a
high level.  
  
  
  
HIEU 702 COLLOQUIUM ON EARLY MODERN EUROPE  
[ Mr. H. C. Erik
Midelfort](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/midelfort.html)  
  
This course provides a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to fifteen
important topics in the history of early modern Europe, ca. 1350-1750. While
the required reading is in English and cannot touch on all aspects of each
national literature from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, lists of
supplementary reading will guide those who want suggestions in areas that we
cannot all cover in class. Oral reports will acquaint the class with books or
disputes that we will not have time to examine in detail.  
  
Students will write five book reviews of about 1000 words each, drawn from the
list of assigned or collateral reading. Each student will also make one
presentation to the class of about ten minutes, introducing or summarizing a
recommended book.  
  
Required reading will be drawn from the following books:  Francis Oakley, _The
Western Church in the Late Middle Ages_

This course is part of the new, required sequence for graduate students in
modern European history. Open to others with the consent of the instructor.
"Discussion of major topics in the history of 20th century European history
within a seminar setting." HIEU 802 MASTER'S ESSAY RESEARCH  
[ Mr. H. C. Erik
Midelfort](http://www.virginia.edu/~history/faculty/midelfort.html)  
  
This course is intended to bring students to the point of finishing their
Master's Theses. Weekly meetings concentrate on the careful definition of
useful topics, library research methods and exercises, theoretical and
technical writing problems, and on mutual criticism of written results. There
is no set required reading, but all students will have to find and read a few
master's theses in their area of interest to get a sense of what such a thesis
is. With due application, second-year students should be able to finish their
theses during the semester.

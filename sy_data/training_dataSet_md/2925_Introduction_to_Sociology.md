_Sociology is the study of society.   It focuses on identifying, explaining,
and interpreting patterns and processes of human social relations.  This
introductory course is designed not just to teach you some of the major
findings of sociology, but to help you master fundamental sociological skills,
including both the ability to think with a "sociological imagination" and to
master the basics of computer-based data analysis--skills which have broad
applicability in a range of educational and work settings.  It is my hope that
this hands-on experience of "doing" sociology will both enliven your interest
in sociological analysis and help you develop practical skills that you can
use in other contexts as well._

**The Fall 2002 version of this course will be largely the same, except that
there will be a new edition of Discovering Sociology.**

up with the course readings, and to participate, to the extent possible in a
large class, in class discussions.  You are responsible for all material
covered in class, including powerpoint-assisted lectures, films, video clips,
and computer-projected exercises in data analysis.

**Exams** |  There will be three closed-book, multiple-choice exams in this
course, two during the semester and a final.  _Study Guides_ will be handed
out before each exam.   These three exams will make up 50% of your grade. _

it.  
__Practice On-Line Quizzes_ are available at the text website.  These Chapter
Tests provide a useful way of reviewing the text material.  Use of these

**MicroCase  
Exercises** |  You will be asked to complete five computer-based assignments
from the _Discovering Sociology_ workbook, using the _Microcase Explorit_ data
analysis software that comes with it and which will also be available on the
campus network, accessible from the computer labs (click here for
instructions).   In addition, there will be a "Do-Your-Own-Exercise" which
will ask you to formulate your own hypothesis and test it.  The five exercises
will count for 20% of your grade; the Do-Your-Own Exercise will count for an
another 20%.  
To get full credit, these assignments must be handed in at the class for which
they are assigned, and **_must include a printout_** of the data for the final
question.   Late exercises will be accepted, but will be penalized ten points.
You will be responsible for the material taught through the exercises for the
exams.  
Two student assistants,  Derrick Chin and Nakia Reese, will be available to
assist students with using the MicroCase program and doing the various
exercises.  Periodic lab hours will be announced in class and in the
Announcements box at the top of this page. In addition you may email either of
them to set up an appointment as well.

Sociology  
Virtual Tours ** | In order to learn about sociological resources on the web,
you will be asked to complete two "Virtual Tour" assignments.  These virtual
tours ask you to explore a variety of sociologically-relevant websites, many
of them interactive ones where you call up specific information and analyze
it, and then submit your results electronically.  You must complete the
Sociology Virtual Tour: Doing Sociology on the World Wide Web, as well as one
of the virtual tours (other than Tour A) at the  Wadsworth Virtual Tour site.
These two exercises will together count for 10% of your grade.  _Please note:
electronic submission of your virtual tour answers constitutes a promise that
you accessed the sites and found the answers on your own.Plagiarism here or
elsewhere will be severely penalized._

learning and that learning to use technology effectively is a critical job
skill for the 21st century.  The use of computer technology will be an
important part of this course, both in the classroom, where internet usage and
powerpoint presentations will be common, and in your coursework outside of
class.  All out-of-class coursework can be performed in one of the various
computer labs on campus.  If you use a home computer, it will be necessary to
have the Adobe Acrobat and RealPlayer plugins installed; most recent versions
of browsers include them.   If you need to download either of them, click on

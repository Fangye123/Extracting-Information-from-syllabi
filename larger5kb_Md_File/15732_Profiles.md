## ![](../../images/1Copter.gif) IEP's for Students

**If you are a parent, you probably have this blue sky idea that schools
should serve your child in very special ways. Yes, schools should teach
everyone, but you are sending your precious youngster to school, and no one
ever mattered any more to you than this defenseless little imp.**

![](../../images/41imp.gif)

**This is a little rascal for whom you locked up medicine cabinets, paid for
baby sitters, listened to the howling while you put him or her into a car
seat. You sacrificed candle light dinners, bought play pens instead of
designer jeans, and had less sleep than ever in your life - including those
party nights in adolescence.**

**Now, this little diamond in the rough heads to school. You want this to be a
happy time, a safe time, a time worthy of half the child's waking hours. This
education will prepare the child for life, teach him or her the basics,
reading, math, playing well with others. . . and that is the way most parents
really feel about their child and school.**

![](../../images/42chldrn.jpg)

**Those of us who have children with disabilities have all those dreams, too.
Some of the blue sky is clouded over, though. We are not certain what our
child's potential is -- and we are pretty sure that the child will not be able
to stand up and protect his or her rights. Often we feel even more protective
and concerned about this one with big hurdles to jump -- disabilities. Some
can't hear, or do not know that others are making fun. Some are going to face
repeated challenges, just getting pants buttoned up. Some cannot even tell the
teacher that toileting is imminent.**

**No wonder there has been so much litigation and so many parents have deep
feelings of concern. We do not think of children with disabilities as being
less important than other children -- in fact, sometimes we feel we need to
champion their rights because they are so often treated as the underdogs.**

![](../../images/tornado.gif)

**After all the huffing and puffing, the lobbying and senate hearings, the
court cases and class action suits, we have come to a process that is pretty
effective if done correctly. It is mandated by law, initially
called[PL94-142](http://thearc.org/faqs/pl94142.html) and now called IDEA or
Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.**

**That process is the I E P or** **Individual** **Educational Plan** **.**

**![](../../images/04litng.gif)Who is eligible for an IEP?**

![](../../images/04litng.gif) **How does the process begin?**

**The first step in determining if a student will receive an IEP, or needs
special services, is called screening. The Screen meets these purposes:**

![](../../images/1bchk.gif)**determine whether a student has a school related
disability**

![](../../images/1bchk.gif)**look for the kind of services that would make an
educational difference**

**This is not the time for formal testing, this is a time to observe, look at
the student's abilities and how closely they fit with age appropriate actions
and abilities. It is a time to gather information, for each person who is
interested in the well-being of the child to look for and strengthen clues to
the needs of the child. Screening can include routine testing and every day,
in the classroom assessments, and those tests can look at the strengths of the
child, what is going well, what work is being done correctly, how the
youngster feels about school, how the parents feel about the whole
situation.**

![](../../images/1rnbwball.gif)

**The next step provides help to teachers who find a child challenging or
recognize that the child is not making the expected gains or adjustment to the
social setting of the school and is called prereferral**. **The purpose of
this step focuses on helping the child and not jumping to the conclusion that
special education is the best or only answer.**

![](../../images/1rnbwball.gif)

**If it looks as though the student needs more services than those identified
and provided in the prefererral step, the student moves forward to the
referral stage. Now there is a formal request, in writing, to have the student
evaluated. Evaluation moves the student closer to a diagnosis and the school
closer to receiving Federal funds to help provide additional services to the
youngster. **

![](../../images/rainbowrld.gif)

![](../../images/04litng.gif) **Nondiscriminatory evaluation procedures**

**The purpose of this step is to do the very best possible job of identifying
the child's strengths and weaknesses. The questions to be asked and answered
are:**

![](../../images/qdot.gif) **Does the child really have a disability that is
serious enough to need additional services and
support![](../../images/qdot.gif)**

****

![](../../images/qdot.gif) **What tests will give us the best look at the
student needs and strengths** ![](../../images/qdot.gif)

![](../../images/qdot.gif) **Can we evaluate the student, using tests that are
the most free from cultural and linguistic bias** ![](../../images/qdot.gif)

![](../../images/rnbwlitebar.gif)

Safeguards for Nondiscriminatory Evaluation  
  
---  
**Areas of Assessment** ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) include more than one test
![](../../images/1bchk.gif)include wide range of developmental information,
such as the PEPSI screening ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)look at levels of
functioning outside of the school setting ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)include
health, hearing, vision, motor ability, communication skills screening along
with the academic evaluation ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) assess specific areas
of concern such as reading, math, not just a general IQ score or Achievement
test score [they often measure the same things]  
**Administering the Assessments** ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) select them to
be as culturally and linguistically unbiased as possible
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) look for tests that have the greatest reliability
and validity ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) administer them in the child's
primary language, remembering that a primary spoken language may not be a
language the student can read ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)access the child's
true abilities rather than mirroring known sensory problems that make
evaluation difficult ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) a trained professional
administers the tests and does so taking into account the child's age, ability
to concentrate, attention to the test, rapport, appropriate testing setting,
lack of distracters, sense of safety and esteem ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)
conform to the directions and expectations expressed by test authors
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) include additional evaluations or reevlatuations
if the testing situation does not match those that will provide the best
student outcome ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)include data from classroom
observation, school behaviors, such as in the cafeteria, during special
classes, when interacting with peers, on the bus -- with adequate time spent
observing to provide a clear picture of the child's strengths and actions
![](../../images/1bchk.gif)provide information about adaptations or changes
made during testing that might skew results or invalidate the outcome when
making predictions based on norms  
**Timing**![](../../images/1bchk.gif) evaluation occurs before placement in
special programs and prior to pulling a student out of a program
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) reevaluations occur every three years unless
student needs them more frequently or the transdisciplinary team sees no
change and no need for additional evaluation and puts that in writing  
  
**Parental Notice - Parental Consen** t ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents
are fully informed of the consideration of special services
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents receive a clear description of their
rights and their child's rights in a language that is understandable and clear
to them and they sign a document stating a summary of their rights and that
they are clear about them ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)parents consent to the
testing to take place ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents see the final
evaluation, may have a personal copy and have the right to have findings
explained to them in a way that makes the findings clear to them
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents must be told of anything the school
refuses to do that might be in their best interest ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)
parents have a right to a second evaluation at their own expense
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents have a right to bring someone along who
can help them understand and make good decisions for their child
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents have a right to bring the student to the
meetings ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) parents have a right to privacy
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) Agreeing to testing and evaluation is not the same
thing as agreeing to placement or agreeing with the objectives that evolve.
These are separate and may include new steps.
![](../../images/1bchk.gif)Parents may request the assistance of a mediator if
they feel they are not receiving adequate services ![](../../images/1bchk.gif)
Parents can and do sue districts when there is blatant disregard for the well
being of their child.  
  
**Interpretation of Assessments** ![](../../images/1bchk.gif) This is usually
done by combining the findings of the transdisciplinary team
![](../../images/1bchk.gif)Refuse to make politically motivated choices or
allow LEP, racial or linguistic bias to enter into the decision
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) Help parents and others without assessment
expertise to understand the findings in a commonsense manner
![](../../images/1bchk.gif) Be honest and open about things that may change
based on development, the student getting an adaptive device - such as a
hearing aid, or the difference a change in teachers or gender of a teacher
might make -- and the same is true of parents. They need to help the team
understand conditions at home that might be transitory and lead to poor
student achievement -- new child, blended family with new siblings, mother's
serious illness, parental drug or substance abuse, pending divorce, etc.  
  


![](../../images/rainbowrld.gif)

**This is also a critical time to pay attention to the rights of the child and
the rights of the parents.**

**This is called![](../../images/scale4.gif)** **Due Process**

![](../../images/04litng.gif) **What is Due Process?**

**[Due Process Rights](http://thearc.org/faqs/dueproc.html)**  
  
---  
Right to know  
  
Guaranteed active participation in the IEP Process  
  
Appropriate Evaluation  
Independent Evaluation  
Placement Hearing Resolution  
Input in the IEP  
Communication of Team Decisions  
Right to Information  
Stay-put Provision  
Right to Confidentiality  
Right of Action in Federal Court  
  
**It is hoped that due process will accomplish the following purposes:**

**![](../../images/skydot.gif) accountability**

**![](../../images/skydot.gif) a better balance of power**

**![](../../images/skydot.gif) fair & supportive treatment of child and
parents**

**![](../../images/skydot.gif) focus on understanding and meeting children's
rights and needs**

**When there are irreconcilable difference between parents and schools, IDEA
provides a mediation process that is called a Due Process Hearing. In fact,
parents are not only strongly urged to go to mediation before suing the
school, they must attend counseling and explore the benefits of mediation.**

![](../../images/rainbowrld.gif)

**![](../../images/04litng.gif)**What is an[IEP](http://www.autism-
society.org/packages/IEP.html#overview)?****

**The IEP is developed to provide the very best possible set of services and
educational growth plans for a student and it is designed to be a team
process.**

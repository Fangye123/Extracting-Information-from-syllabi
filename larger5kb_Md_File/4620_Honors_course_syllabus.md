### Geosciences 422-381, Honors Seminar

### Discovering Earth History

### Fall 1997

#### Course Description

Beginning around 1650, the earth was recognized as an object of scientific
study. By the early nineteenth century, geology emerged as an independent
science and by mid-century several fundamentally opposing viewpoints
developed, some of which continue (in some form) to the present day. This
course will review the ancient and medieval views of the earth formed the
starting point for this scientific development. It will consider how geology
emerged as a study of a dynamic, changing earth, how early scientists
reconstructed earth history, and how they developed theoretical approaches to
study it.  
  
The two central texts will provide a broad introduction to the subject matter
from two contrasting perspectives (British-American versus Continental
European). Students will read an analyze excerpts from early scientific
writers from Leonardo da Vinci, Descartes and Agricola through Cuvier, Lyell
and Darwin. These varied readings will be the basis for class discussions and
starting points for student papers. Finally, students will have the
opportunity to compare the geological theories to actual geological features
through a one-day field trip.

#### Student Requirements

This course will be conducted as a seminar. The instructor will provide
questions to guide students' analysis of the readings and will clarify
geologic terms as needed. However, students are expected to have read, thought
about and written about the readings before class. Class discussion and group
presentations will be used as appropriate. In short, students should come to
class prepared to express their ideas and to learn from each other.  
  
Student's grades will be based on writting assignments (25%, mostly pre-
class), class attendance (10%), class participation (15%), and three short
papers (50%). All papers must be typed and must be rewritten once after a
critical review by instructor.

#### Student Papers

You will have a limited choice of topics for each paper. Generally, your goal
will be to write a apaper that (1) summarizes material that you will have read
and discussed, and (2) develops and defends an interpretation on the material.
The papers will be limited in length to 3-5 pages because I want you to
develop a concise writing style. Each paper is due on the dates indicated on
the syllabus. My intention is to return them with comments during the next
class session. You will then have about one week to revise them for a final
grade.

#### Textbooks and readings

You should purchase the following books:

> Albritton, C. C., Jr., 1986, The Abyss of Time.  
>  Gohau, G., 1990, A History of Geology.  
>  Rudwick, M. J. S., 1985, The Meaning of Fossils, second edition.

Copies of Mather and Mason and all readings under "other" are on reserve in
the library (including electronic reserve) and in the Geoscience student room
(Lapham 328).

#### Electronic reserve, email, and the Web

You will find that you can access the readings under "other" (except for
Rudwick) and many of the Mather and Mason selections through the Library's
electronic reserve system (their URL is
<http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/Library/ERES/>). The Library has information on what
you need to use this system.  
  
I have had IM&T set up an email reflector (geohistory@csd.uwm.edu) to
facilitate communication among us. Messages sent to this address will be
reflected to me and all students. This is a good tool to send general
questions or comments. Use my email address (mtharris@csd.uwm.edu) if you want
to send a message to me alone.  
  
The class has a Web page that can be accessed through my page. To get their
directly, point your browser to:
[http://www.uwm.edu:80/People/mtharris/Honors97/HonHome.html](http://www.uwm.edu/People/mtharris/Honors97/HonHome.html).
You will find a listing of the students in the class, a copy of this syllabus,
and class summaries (as we progress through the semester).

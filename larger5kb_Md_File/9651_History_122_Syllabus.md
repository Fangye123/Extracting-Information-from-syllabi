Attendance

_

Punctual attendance is required, and students arriving after roll is called
are considered absent.  **Two unexcused absences are allowed.**   In order to
have absences excused, please bring the appropriate signed form from the
Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.  This form is also required
for the make-up of missed exams.  Each unexcused absence beyond the two
allowed will lower the class-participation component of the final grade.

_

Exams

_

Including the final, there are three exams in the course, each consisting of
multiple-choice questions, terms for identification, and one essay question.
Although I will try to have some spares available in case of emergencies,
please remember to bring at least one **small exam book** (blue book) to the
exams.    These are available in the campus bookstore.

_

Writing Assignments

_

Writing assignments for the course are based on the profiles of historical
figures in Sowards' _Makers of World History_.   All students are required to
complete essays on at least **six** of these figures during the semester.
Essays should be approximately two typed pages, double-spaced and must be
submitted **at the beginning of class on the day that the topic is scheduled
for discussion** (see schedule above).    In writing the essays, students may
either respond to the questions suggested at the end of the readings or select
appropriate topics of their own.

_

News Article Scrapbooks

_

In the course of the semester, students are required to collect at least 15
news articles related to the course and assemble clippings or copies of these
in a scrapbook to be turned in on the last day of class.  The articles should
relate to **current** events, and at least 10 must come from major national
and international newspapers such as _The New York Times_ , _The Washington
Post_ , and _The International Herald Tribune_. Students may select articles
on any area covered in the course, but the best scrapbooks will generally be
those which exhibit some thematic coherence.

_

Academic Honesty

_

All students are expected to maintain ethical integrity.  Any instance of
cheating or plagiarism constitutes grounds for the assignment of an F in the
course, and such cases will normally be reported immediately to both the Vice
President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs.

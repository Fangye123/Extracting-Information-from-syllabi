    1. **CourseDescription**  
This would be a lower division literature course that is taught in the
computer-assisted environment. A class list-serv would be implemented and
hypermedia rather than web authoring would be emphasized. This class will have
two major threads: the first will regard the "conversations" that take place
within literature. Not the singular experience of one author responding to
another's work (though that will be noted), but rather the collaborative
atmosphere and influences of other artists, authors and voices. Two particular
examples will be the modernist poets as well as the members of the Harlem
Renaissance. These resonate throughout the readings, through Alice Walker
writing about searching for the grave of Zora Neale Hurston and poet Michael
Harper discussing the influence of jazz in his works. Students will have an
opportunity to discover that authors like TS Eliot, HD, WCWilliams and Ezra
Pound all knew each other and actively engaged each other in their writings.
The other thread will be that of the personal narrative. What is so powerful
about an individual's personal story? Although these threads may appear to be
oppositional, they are complementary in important ways. Through autobiography
students can will be able to assess the writer's own sense of voice and how
his or her voice formed part of a larger collective. Students will participate
in a semester-long project to build a hypertext that engages a particular
"voice" in American literature. One primary example of multiple voices and
styles will be Jean Toomer's _Cane_ , a text that contains poetry, prose and a
play. This hypertext will be a multiplied product, that students will
"publish" via ftp. A short WWW page will articulate their approach and
eventually serve as the link to the ftp of the project (in whatever format,
but as a stand-alone app). Students will also take a midterm and final exam.

    4. **StudentGoals:**  

      * I would like my students to become comfortable with technology and learn to use it in the context of the class to build their own narratives of American literature. 
      * Discover that literature is the result of interaction with history as well as cultural practices and that it does not exist in a vacuum. Artists knew writers and writers knew politicians and so forth. Debunking the myth of the lone artist is an important goal for me as the instructor. 
      * Analyze literature through the filter of culture as well as that of history. 
      * Learn general biographical information as well as be able to identify work from particular authors. 
      * Learn that collaboration is not collusion and that multimedia often requires multiperspectives and work. 

    5. **EvaluationPlan**  

      * Students will be evaluated in terms of their grades on the midterm and final. The midterm and final will be worth 60% of their overall grade. The other 40% will be in the form of portfolio assessment. The student will be required to write a self-assessment based on their progress across the five dimensions of learning during the course. They can include evidence in the form of IC transcripts, responses to readings, e-mail and project work. They will produce a portfolio with a self-assessment at the end of the semester. They will request a grade based on their self-assessment. This qualitative grade (the one that I award them based on their work) will be combined with the other 60% quantitative to ascertain their final standing in the course. 
      * Students will be encouraged to post questions to the class mailing list as well as ask me specific questions via email. 
      * I will monitor student reading by quality/quantity response in ICs. 
      * Students will also be evaluated in terms of their responses to readings and group/class project work. 
      * Students will have an opportunity to evaluate their peers' performance through peer assessment of their project contributions.

    6. **Smaller Activities**
      * I will use a WWW scavenger hunt of Literature Sites to give students (in teams of two) practice in using the various search engines and strategies. Students will add one site of their own. 
      * Students will answer one of two questions in response to readings. The midterm and final will use these questions as well. 
      * Students will write a one page self-assessment midway through the semester in order to practice for the final portfolio. 

    7. **SampleAssignments**  

      * Most assignments will be reading-oriented. Instead of quizzes, students will be required to turn in written responses to every reading assignment. They will be given two questions to choose from and will respond accordingly. The midterm and final will draw from these smaller assignments so the students can see the larger scope/issues surrounding the literature. Responses will be posted to the class mail list and students will discuss the work through the class list-serv, f2f discussion and via interchanges. Collaboration at this level will be encouraged so students can see how similar conversations took place within literary circles. The midterm and final will take place in class. 
      * The other primary assignment will be research oriented. Students will choose a particular aspect of the Harlem Renaissance and produce a short research paper on the subject. It can be about an author, the music of the era, the artwork, the geography, the politics or the culture. The most important aspect will be the discussion of links to other artists within the movement. Students will produce a 3 page analysis as well as an annotated bibliography and at least three other artifacts in the form of pictures, sound clips or video. All students will be involved in planning the overall hypertext. Two students (on a voluntary basis) will be the technical committee and will not be required to produce research. Instead, they will organize the class work in the form of a multimedia project with the assistance of the instructor.

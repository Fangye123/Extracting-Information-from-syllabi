**_WELCOME_** to **_English 111: Rhetoric and Composition,_** taught
completely over the Internet for the first time at  NCSU. I look forward to
getting to know you throughout the semester and to helping you develop,
improve, and refine your reading, writing, thinking, and research skills. We
will also learn a great deal about using the Internet as an information source
and as a communication tool.  

Successful completion of an Internet course requires strong independent study
skills and rigorous self-discipline; this course requies a great deal of
independent reading and studying, which will be supplemented with weekly on-
line discussions, group work, lectures, and research in our **_virtual
classroom._** Students who wish to benefit from and successfully complete a
course taught strictly over the Internet must be prepared to devote more time
and attention to the course than they would most courses taught in a
traditional classroom. Strong reading ability, excellent time-management
skills, and the discipline to work independently as well as cooperatively in
group on-line activities are essential.

      * submit essays and other assignments using the attachments function available through HoTMaiL. 
  * When you set up your HoTMaiL account, please use your first and last name rather than an obscure nickname that I won't recognize.

**_COURSE POLICIES:_**  

  * Participation:
    * Regular, weekly participation is essential for successful completion of this or any distance learning course. When you do not participate, you miss vital information and group activities specifically designed to explain key concepts and to enhance each stage of the writing process. The course is designed to be interactive, and 20% of your final grade will come from participation in on-line activities. 

Your reading and other homework assignments are posted on the assignment page.
Each week you should complete all assignments and answer the weekly discussion
questions posted on NetForum. You will also be responding to answers from
others in the class. You will  be taking brief quizzes approximately every
week early in the semester and participating in peer revision groups with some
of your classmates every two to three weeks. When you do not participate in
the weekly activities, you receive a grade of "0" for the week. At the end of
the semester, I usually drop your lowest two participation or quiz grades.
Please pay attention to due dates and respond on time.  

If illness, accidents, or other emergencies prevent your participating at any
point during the semester, please contact me by e-mail as soon as possible so
that we can try to work out plan to get you back on schedule as soon as
possible. If I do not hear from you for three consecutive weeks, I will assume
that you are no longer participating. Unless you officially drop the course,
you will receive a grade of "F."  


  * Late Papers:
    * Please submit papers in the stages outlined in the paper assignment. Drafts will be due  by the specified date, and final papers should be sent to me as e-mail attachments by the specified date. Please e-mail me if you are having difficulty meeting a deadline so that we may discuss a possible extention. Do not assume that I will accept a late paper without prior discussion. 
  


  * Academic Integrity:
    * **__Plagiarism__** (using the words and/or ideas of another source without proper documentation) and **__cheating__** (using the work of another student or any previously prepared work from any source) are serious academic offenses and carry serious consequences. Incidents of suspected plagiarism and/or cheating will be handled according to the university policy on academic integrity explained in the **_Code of Student Conduct._** Confirmation or cheating or plagiarism, either between student and teacher or at a hearing before the Academic Integrity Review Board, may result in any or a combination or the following:  
        * a grade of "F" on the specific assigment on which the offense occurred;
        * a grade of "F" for the course;
        * required participation in the Academic Integrity Seminar Series conducted by the Office of Student Conduct;
        * suspension or explusion from the university;
        * other sanctions determined by teh Academic Integrity Review Board.
We will spend a lot of time learning how to properly use and document source
materials; if you have questions at any point during the semester, please
contact me.

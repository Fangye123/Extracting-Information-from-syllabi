Fall 2001 Course Syllabus:  CSC 112 Computer Science II  
Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures  
---  
Overview  
  

This is the second programming course in the required Computer Science major
sequence. It will cover more advanced programming techniques (object
oriented), more advanced Unix concepts, data structures and the object
oriented programming language C++.

This is a programming intensive course. There are weekly lab and homework
assignments and a final programming project, counting for 70% of the grade.
Two exams (midterm and final) will test mostly theoretical knowledge.

Areas of Study:

  * Object-oriented programming in C++. Templates.
  * More on pointers, references and indirection.
  * Basic Data Structures:
    * Stacks
    * Queues
    * Linked Lists
  * Trees
  * Graphs
  * Searching and Sorting Algorithms

  
Course Materials  
  

You will need two books for this class: one covering C++, one covering data
structures. The following are recommended, and are available at the Grecourt
Bookstore:

C++:

    Jesse Liberty, Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days. SAMS Publishing, 2001.
Data Structures:

    A. Michael Berman, [Data Structures via C++:  Objects by Evolution](http://www.amberman.org/evolve/). Oxford University Press, 1997.

One student recommends Programming with C++ by John Hubbard, from the Schaum's
Outlines series (McGraw Hill).

Other C++ reference books are available in McConnell 104 (not to be taken out
of the lab!!).

  * C++ Core Language, Gregory Satir & Doug Brown
  * C++ Primer, Stanley B. Lippman
  * Visual C++ 5 The Complete Reference,Chris H. Pappas & William H. Murray

Course Requirements  
  

#### Prerequisites

Normally students will be expected to take CSC 111 before this course.
Students who have taken an equivalent programming course or who have otherwise
achieved the requisite programming skills should consult the instructor.

#### Work

  * Weekly programming assignments (labs and homeworks).
  * One in-class midterm exam and a final in the final exam period.
  * Final Programming Project with in-class presentation.

#### Warning!

This is a programming-intensive course, designed to take neophyte programmers
and turn them into nascent software engineers. While programming is one of the
most interesting, challenging and rewarding intellectual activities out there,
it is almost impossible to learn it without a lot of practice. This takes
time, especially in the "dreaded" process of **debugging**. If you get easily
frustrated by the amount of time spent debugging, you should see me very soon
\-- before it becomes a problem.

#### Grading

  * Labs, homeworks and class participation 50%.
  * Exams 30%.
  * Final Project 20%.

For the final grade, you have the option to choose one out of the 10 or so
homeworks - presumably the one with the lowest grade - which will be dropped
from the final average computation. However, you can only choose to drop a
homework for which you did the work. If you miss a homework you get 0 points
on it (and that will count towards the final average).

#### General Grading Guidelines

  1. The program has to compile. Do not submit code that does not compile, as it will receive a minimal grade of C- (if after looking at it I see that at least it resembles a possible solution to the problem -- else it will be an E).
  2. It is better to submit a program that works, even if it has not implemented all the required features. Keep intermediate versions of your programs in separate directories, and if you do not have time for last minute debugging, submit the last version that (at least partially) worked.
  3. The way you document your program affects your grade: be generous with pertinent comments! Students will be expected to meet the documentation standards described in class.
  4. The majority of the grade reflects the functionality of the program (whether or not it works), but approximately 20% will be based upon the program design. Elements of good design include the proper use of program documentation, the quality of the user interface (if required for the assignment), and cleanness and elegance of programming style.
  5. Throughout the semester, interspersed with the technical aspects of programming and theory (data structures), I will teach you simple software engineering principles, which convey scientific discipline to the art of programming. Class attendence, participation in discussions regarding possible solutions, self-study discipline, good organizational skills are your key to mastering programming and avoiding lengthy debugging sessions. Your final grade will also have to reflect and reward these qualities, and the work on the final project will be the best indicator.
  6. To summarize: **A** level work means quality programs which run, do what they are supposed to do, are well designed and documented and _submitted in time_.

#### Lab, Homework and Lateness Policy

Labwork is designed to be completed during the scheduled lab time. If for some
reason you are left behind or want to redo the work later at your own pace,
you have to submit everything by midnight the same day.

All homework is assigned on Thursdays and is due on Wednesday by midnight
(before the new lab on Tuesday). Students are expected not to share code
related to homework assignments.

**NO late homework** will be accepted, except for documented extenuating
circumstances. You should submit, by the midnight deadline, the homework
solution reflecting your work on it up to that point. Note that the homework
submissions will be electronically collected precisely at the project
deadline.

The final project is due before the last class (Thursday, December 13,
9:00am). No late submissions are accepted.

  
  
Schedule of Topics  
  

Note:  Lecture notes and lab assignment handouts may not be posted for all the
classes. A handout available before the actual lecture or lab meeting is only
tentative and may be changed at any time by the professor. Handouts are not
meant as a substitute for class attendence, but as guidelines for the topics
covered in class.

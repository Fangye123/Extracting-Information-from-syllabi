| **OVERVIEW**

 **World War I (1914-1918) and the Russian Revolution (1917-1921) ushered in a
century of war and revolution that undermined the power of Europe in the
world, created new global configurations of power, and released strong
nationalist movements and ideological conflicts that would shape the rest of
the century.   In the aftermath of what people called the Great War, modern
society and culture also faced revolutionary challenges. The guns of August,
1914 changed the modern world forever.** |  ** TB:

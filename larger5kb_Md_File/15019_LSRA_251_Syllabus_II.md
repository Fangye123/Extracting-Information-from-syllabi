**General Description: "Research Design and Methods II" is designed to assist
students in developing a basic understanding of qualitative and quantitative
data analysis and interpretation techniques. The course is taught as a
graduate seminar and encourages students to think critically about the meaning
and implications to practice that result from research. The focus of the
course is data analysis and data interpretation of the student's research
project proposed in RECR 250 that will result in a verbal presentation and an
article for submission to a research journal.**

**Expectations: This course continues to address the expectations from RECR
250 to provide students with the learning experiences necessary to develop a
"consumer appreciation" of research. Students are expected to collect their
research data as quickly as possible; much of the data analysis/interpretation
discussions will become more meaningful when applied to your own data. As in
RECR 250, I expect that you will attend class, be fully prepared, inform me if
some extenuating circumstance keeps you from class, and turn in assignments
during the class period in which they are due.**

**Assignments and Evaluation: In addition to the culminating research article
ready for submission for publication to a professional research journal,
additional course assignments will be made. These assignments are briefly
described in the tentative timeline. Each will be more fully discussed in
class. All assignments are designed to help students prepare for analyzing and
interpreting their research project data. The assignment weightings are: class
assignments =20%, symposium presentation = 30%, and the article/abstract =
50%.**

**Students will formally present their research findings during a special RECR
Graduate Research Symposium. The format for the symposium will be discussed
later in the semester but the basic outline will be for a key note
presentation by a leading Leisure Studies researcher (Dr. Val Freysinger) to
be followed by the student presentations. Students will have 20 minutes in
which to present their findings and implications. The Symposium will be open
to other UNC students and faculty as well as practitioners, professors and
students from the surrounding area. A proceedings of abstracts will also be
produced. The research project will also be described in a research abstract
and article that is ready for submission to a professional research journal.**

**Grading procedures will be the same as for RECR 250- I will ultimately be
responsible for all course grades. Another gentle reminder- no incompletes
will be given unless there are extraordinary extenuating circumstances.
Failing to collect your data in a timely fashion will _not_ be considered as
an excuse. Incompletes must be discussed before the last day of RECR 251
class.**

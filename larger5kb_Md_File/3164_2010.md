**Course Description**

In this interdisciplinary women's studies course we will examine the issues of
feminist theory, feminist methodology, women's  
lives, experiences, and accomplishments and the role that women played/play or
took/take over time and across cultures. We  
will use a range of varying sources, from monographs to statistics, literature
to historical documents, theoretical and analytical  
writings, and personal narratives as social documents to provide students with
a framework for understanding "what it means to  
be a 'woman' in terms of variety of factors."

**Course Purpose and Rationale**

The primary goal of this course is to better facilitate students'
understanding of the socio-historical and socio-political forces that  
have structured the experiences of women both within the United States and
around the world. The reading materials in this  
course are aimed to encourage students to become engaged in lively, relevant,
and insightful class discussions as well as to  
explore, analyze, and examine the ways in which race, class, gender, sexual
identity, and cultural diversity affect the lives of  
women. The course includes a comparison of how different social and cultural
systems have affected the changing historical role  
of women.

**Course Objectives**

1\. To introduce students to some of the most significant pedagogical and
theoretical writings by and about women, thereby  
allowing them to become acquainted within that perspective.

2\. To encourage all students to gain a broader understanding of the
definition of identity, self-consciousness, and visibility in the  
context of women's creative writings both as works of art an as social
documents, as well as their own life experiences.

3\. To expose students to the roles which sexual politics play in keeping
women's oppression natural and systematic.

4\. To introduce students to ways in which women's experiences are affected by
such factors as race, ethnicity, and class as well  
as social construction of gender and its influence on contemporary social
organizations and behaviors.

5\. To introduce students to some of the political, economic, social, and
cultural debates involving the theories of the "politics of  
location" raised by women of color within the United States as well as the
theories of the "politics of the Third World feminims"  
within the global context.

**Course Requirements**

1\. Attendance: Regular class attendance is an absolute necessity and will be
monitored in this course. A grade is given for  
attendance. You need to arrive to class on time. Excessive tardiness is
disruptive and disrespectful and this will affect your final  
grade. If you miss a session you may check with another student to review any
notes, activities, or assignments you may have  
missed. Then, contact me for clarification and further assistance. Students
must inform the instructor of excessive illness and  
other absences on approved University activities in order to be excused for
missing class. Additional absences must be  
explained by a written excuse from the Vice President for Student Affairs.

2\. Class Participation and Discussion: This course is centered on class
discussion and participation. It is essential that each  
student comes fully prepared to class meetings having completed assigned
reading with questions, comments, and issues s/he  
wants to discuss. Develop and use critical thinking skills to discuss the
reading materials, and to share your insights and  
experiences with the rest of the class. The weekly reading assignments should
be read prior to the week during which they will  
be discussed. I will allocate a percentage of the total grade based on your
participation in the class discussion.

3\. Assignments:

\- Oral Presentation: In addition to regular participation in class
discussion, students will be asked to form study groups, each  
consisting of three to five participants and, together, facilitate one class
meeting. I will circulate a sheet for you to sing-up for the  
class of your choice. The study group, before that class meeting, should meet
to discuss the reading, develop a series of  
discussion questions, and compile any additional materials they would like to
cover with the class. Each student should include  
the following tasks in her/his presentation: giving a quick summary of the
major themes in the reading, suggesting comparisons  
with earlier readings, giving any additional background information that seems
pertinent, and raising questions for class  
discussion. Each group will steer the discussion until the questions have been
discussed adequately. These oral presentations will  
begin the second week of the semester.

\- Position Papers/Assignments: In these four (4) short papers, students will
explore specific experiences of the construction of  
their own identities through analytically engaging and using writings from
this course. Your position paper should take the form of  
one or more of the following mediums: autobiography, essay, historical
document, journal, painting, photography, poetry, etc. To  
explore your own processes of the construction of identity you must
incorporate reflections on the following questions: how does  
sexuality induce the experience? race and ethnicity? class? gender? language?
how are these impingements represented,  
contested, and negotiated? This exercise should help you to understand the
knowledge and theory learned from this women's  
studies course by turning it into a "lived experience" within a feminist
framework. The deadlines to turn in these assignments will  
be given throughout this syllabus.

\- Reaction Papers: Students will be asked to write seven (7) short papers to
record their reaction to and reflections on the  
readings and class discussion, films, etc. In these papers, you should briefly
summarize the main points of the reading, to  
compare or contrast two or more readings, as well as to include questions,
commentaries, and challenge arguments especially if  
you disagree with the author. The grading criteria for this assignment will be
based mainly  
upon your own use of critical thinking skills to discuss the reading materials
rather than providing summaries of them. The  
Deadlines for these papers are given in the course outline section.

\- Group Project/Presentation: In a final project, you will be required to
prepare with a group a project on a related topic to this  
course. Each group should be formed by two (2) to four (4) students. Be
creative and use some forms of innovative approaches  
to the choice of topic as well as the realization of this project. Examples
may include role playing, engaging in a controversial but  
constructive debate, performing a feminist oral history, etc. You should
consult with me about this project and the selected topic  
of your choice early in the semester. The presentations will be scheduled for
the last two weeks of the semester before Final  
Examinations.

\- Important Reminder: Students are advised to consult with me, early on in
the semester, about final decisions on the methods  
and the contents of their presentations, the selected medium for their
position papers/assignments, and the topic of their group  
project/presentation. Assignments that have not met approval by the instructor
may have point value deducted from the final  
grade. Individual meetings with the instructor are encouraged to discuss the
developments of your assignments.

All writing assignments must be typed and double-spaced. Written assignments
and oral presentations must meet the deadlines  
for which they are scheduled. Late assignments will result in one-letter grade
penalty. You should start early in the semester to  
select a medium for your position papers/assignments and the topic of your
group project/presentation.

4\. Plagiarism/Academic Dishonesty: All requirements of this course must be
completed within the codes of academic honesty.  
Students who plagiarize will be given an "F" grade for their work. You must
provide proper documentation for all your writing  
assignments, which means the use of standard citations in from of footnotes,
endnotes, and /or bibliography whenever you  
borrow a phrase, an idea, or definitions from another text or author. You may
consult either MLA Handbook or A Manual for  
Writers by Kate Turabian for this information.

5\. Respect: All students will respect the views/opinions of other students.
Debates are encouraged, but disrespect is not.

6\. Course Content: This syllabus provides a general plan and its content may
change upon the instructor's decision. Students will  
be notified of such changes prior to their implementation.

7\. Course Evaluation and Grading System: Evaluation and grading of students'
work will be based on their class attendance  
and participation (weekly discussions and oral presentations), two writing
assignments, a group project/presentation, and the  
final examination. The total percentage points attainable is 100, distributed
as follows:

Attendance ..............10% Position Paper .......15%  
Class participation .....15% Reaction Paper ......15%  
Oral Presentation .......15% Group Project .......15%  
Final Examination ..15%

**Course Outline and Readings**

Some lectures will compliment the readings. Since students are responsible for
both the lectures and readings in preparation for  
final examination, they are advised to attend class sessions regularly--having
read the textbooks and other assigned readings,  
well prepared to engage in lively discussions.

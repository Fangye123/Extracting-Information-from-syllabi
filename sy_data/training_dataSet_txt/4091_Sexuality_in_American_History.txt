Our questions will span a range of concerns. How have ideas about     physical contact and emotional intimacy changed over the past 400 years? What     were the Puritans really like     in private? How Victorian were the Victorians? How wild were the flappers?     We will also explore more political issues. How and why have different authorities     in American society regulated sexual behavior and beliefs? What makes for     periods of sexual reform and revolution? How have the realities of gender,     race and class influenced ideas about sexuality, morality, and power? History 4004 is a writing-intensive seminar     designed primarily for history majors. The formal prerequisites include: History     2004 (Methods), one other history class, and junior or senior standing. The     instructor may waive these requirements for qualified students at her discretion. return to top Required     Readings All books are available from the University Bookstore, Volume Two Bookstore,     and the Tech Bookstore. Many are also available from online booksellers. All     books (except for Major Problems)     are also on reserve at Newman Library.     Kathy Peiss, ed., Major     Problems in the History of American Sexuality Albert Hurtado, Intimate     Frontiers: Sex, Gender, and Culture in Old California Susanna Rowson, Charlotte     Temple Linda Brent (aka Harriet Jacobs), Incidents     in the Life of a Slave Girl George Chauncy, Gay     New York Beth Bailey, Sex     in the Heartland    Online Readings:     - accessed through the "Assignments" link on the class web page (see top of     syllabus for URL), or through "personal reserve" on my office door.    return to top Computer   Requirements This class requires access   to an up-to-date computer and the web - both for e-mail communication and for   use of the course webpage. Course   Webpage You can access the course website through the Blackboard 5 portal at:   http://www.learn.vt.edu.   Logging-in with your Virginia Tech PID and password will give you direct access   to the class web-page, "Hist 4004 - Sexuality in American History" Supplemental reading materials   (noted on the syllabus as "Online Reading") will be posted on the course webpage.   I strongly suggest printing the articles out before   you read them. That way you can take notes in the margins and refer to them   in class. If you have problems with web access, one copy of each article will   also be kept on "personal reserve" in the pocket on my office door. If you borrow   a hardcopy, please return it promptly so that other members of the class will   have access to it. Announcements, discussion schedules,   and relevant handouts will also be posted on the web. Get in the habit of checking   the site on a regular basis. Communication If you wish to communicate with me via e-mail, please be sure to type   "Hist 4004" in the subject header line. Otherwise, I will delete the message   without reading it. I will communicate with you periodically   via e-mail as well. If you check your e-mail through an account other than your   Virginia Tech account (ie: Hotmail or Yahoo), make sure you configure your Virginia   Tech e-mail account to forward your mail. Otherwise you will miss out on important   announcements. Finally, some things are best discussed in person rather than   electronically. If you have a complicated or sensitive problem to discuss, please   feel free to come and introduce yourself to me. I am always available during   my office hours as well as after class.  return to top Course   Requirements  Attendance and Participation The primary format for this course will be student-centered discussion   of course readings. Your active and informed participation will therefore be   crucial for the success of this class. It is especially important that you carefully   read and review the designated readings before   the class meetings for which they are assigned. The readings for each class session   vary in length. I've tried to break up the books so that there is not too much   assigned for any given day, but you may want to look over the schedule and pace   yourself accordingly. There will also be a few short assignments (including   The Vagina Monologues - see   below) that will be folded into your class participation grade. Finally, a few ground rules for   discussion. We will be talking about what many people may consider to be "sensitive"   topics. The beauty of studying history is that we can think and talk about things   like sexuality without having to divulge personal information. I expect that   we will have some lively and heated debates about how Americans in the past   viewed this core aspect of personal identity and meaning. But as we grapple   with the difficult questions that will surely arise, we will all need to make   an effort to treat each other, and each others' contributions to the class discussions,   with respect. Discussion   Leaders Each of you will be expected to lead (or co-lead, depending on the final   size of the class) the classroom discussion once this semester. Class sessions   will generally alternate between instructor-led and student-led discussions.   Discussion leaders are expected to be especially familiar with the readings   for the day, and should meet with each other beforehand to compose a brief set   of questions and identify key themes to guide our discussions. The available dates and topics   for discussion are:  Thurs,     Jan 31 - Sexuality in the British Colonies Thurs,     Feb 7 - Gender Conflict and Social Reform in the Early 19th Century Thurs,     Feb 14 - Sexuality and Race in 19th-Century America   Thurs, Feb 21 - The Sexual     Frontier in Old California  Thurs, Mar 14 - Birth Control,     Abortion, and Sterilization  Thurs, Mar 21 - Working-Class     Women and Modern Sexuality  Thurs, Mar 28 - The Making     of the Gay Male World  Tues, Apr 9 - Sexual Containment     and the Cold War  Thurs, APR 18 - The Sexual     Revolution of the 1960s  Thurs, APR 25 - Sexual Boundaries     at the Dawn of the 21st Century   I will distribute a sign-up list   for leading discussions on Thurs., Jan. 24th. Think about which week and topic   you would like to choose before coming to class that day. Reaction   Papers To help you articulate your ideas both in class and out, you will each   be required to turn in 8 short (1-2 pages, double-spaced) reaction papers over   the course of the semester. The reaction papers provide an opportunity for you   to think critically about the readings for each week - and to come to terms   with the significance and meaning   of the readings. Simple summaries will not suffice. Nor will emotional or gut-level   responses (although your personal perspective will certainly inform your analysis).   Instead, you may use these papers to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of   that week's readings, to respond to the major arguments made by the different   authors, to critically examine the theoretical and methodological frameworks   of the reading assignments, and/or relate them to other readings from the course. You will have 12 opportunities   to write a reaction paper (see course schedule), but you only need to turn in   8. Again, pace yourself wisely - and don't leave them all for the end! Reaction   papers are due at the beginning of class on the dates designated and should   address a sizable portion of the assigned readings for that particular week.   Papers should be concise, well-written, and carefully proofread. No   late papers will be accepted. The   Vagina Monologues Eve Ensler's play, The Vagina   Monologues, will be performed on campus Feb, 8, 9, and 10 in the Haymarket   Theater, Squires Student Center, as part of national V-Day activities against   violence against women. Everyone in the class is required to see this provocative   play and to write a short (1 page) response to it. You're welcome to go as a   group or individually. We will discuss it in class on Tues, Feb 12th. Historiographical   Review All members of the class are required to complete a 12-15 page historiographical   review (double-spaced, ca. 3750 words) on a topic of your choice.  For those of you not familiar with this term, a historiographical   review combines summaries of books with an analysis of the arguments posed by   different historians, evaluations of their methodologies and use of evidence,   and discussions of what these books reveal about major historical themes and   debates. A historiographical paper is not   a "book report," nor is it a research paper. It is, instead, a review of selected   literature in one particular area of study (ie: sexuality in colonial America;   Victorian sexuality; race and sex, etc.), where one considers both the books   and the authors as in conversation with each other. This assignment is designed to   give you the opportunity to gain in-depth historical knowledge in a specific   area of interest, to teach you to read critically and analytically, and to help   you articulate your insights and ideas in writing in a clear and professional   manner. Ultimately, by the end of the semester you will be a better reader and   a better writer. This is a full-semester writing   assignment that will require thought and time to complete. I've established   a number of deadlines to help keep you on track. You will need to choose a topic   by Thurs, Feb 7th, and provide an annotated bibliography (of   at least 3 books, or 2 books plus a number of scholarly articles) by Tues,   Feb 26th. You may use the topics we cover in class as guidelines, or   come up with one of your own. I strongly suggest mining footnotes, as well as   the bibliographies at the end of each chapter in Major   Problems, for reading suggestions. The first draft of your paper will   be due in class on Thurs, APR 4th. The final draft will be   due on the last day of class, Tues, APR 30th. More detailed guidelines and   instructions will be distributed over the course of the semester. Grades Grades for the course will be based on the following formula:   Attendance and Participation  25%    Discussion Leader  10%    Reaction Papers (8 out of       12)  20%    Annotated Bibliography  5%    First Draft of Historiographical       Paper  15%    Final Draft of Historiographical       Paper  25%      Honor Code Students are expected to familiarize themselves with and adhere to the   Virginia Tech Honor Code on all   assignments for this course. Although I strongly encourage students to work   together in study and review groups, all work submitted for a grade must be   your own. return to top     COURSE SCHEDULE       Week       1: Does Sexuality Have a History?

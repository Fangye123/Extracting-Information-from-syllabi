COURSE 
        DESCRIPTION: The transformation of Europe from an isolated, agricultural, 
        and poor society to a powerful, wealthy and expansionist one. Designed 
        to stress the formation of European identity and attitudes, the course 
        begins with the traditional social order inherited from the earlier Middle 
        Ages and then examines how that order is reformed from the twelfth to 
        the fifteenth century. Topics include the commercial revolution, the growth 
        of religious self-expression, the search for political order, and conflict 
        after the transformative crises of the fourteenth century.
COURSE FORMAT: 
        This course will be conducted through a combination of lectures and discussions. 
        Discussions will focus on primary source materials. Students are required 
        to attend all class meetings and come to discussions having already read 
        and though about the texts. Students will also write an original research 
        paper based on primary source materials. Return to Top.

        BOOKS:
        Froissart, Jean, Chronicles, rep ed. (Penguin, 1978)
        Herlihy, David, The Black Death and the Transformation of the West, (Harvard, 
        1997)
        Hollister, C. Warren, Medieval Europe: A Short History, 8th ed. (McGraw-Hill, 
        1998)
        Peters, Edward, ed., Heresy and Authority in Medieval Europe (Pennsylvania,

        Tierney, Brian, ed., Sources of Medieval History, 6th edition (McGraw 
        Hill, 1999)
        Note: You will have to purchase two blue books for the exams. Return 
        to Top.
EXAMS: 
        There will be two exams, each covering the lectures, sources, and books 
        to date. The in-class exam will be held on Oct 11 and the final exam on 
        Tuesday, Dec. 4 from 5:00-7:00pm. The exams will be in essay format, including 
        some short identification questions. The in-class exam will count 25% 
        of the course grade and the final will count 25% of the course grade.
PAPERS: Students 
        will write a research (minimum 10 page) paper on a subject they determine 
        in consultation with the instructor, which will be due at the start of 
        the class on Tuesday, November 20th. I will suggest paper topics and hand 
        out instructions later. You are responsible for maintaining a copy of 
        your paper after submitting the original (make a duplicate copy before 
        turning it in). The paper will count for 25% of the total course grade. 
        
DISCUSSION: 
        Attendance is a required part of the course; students consistently failing 
        to attend class without a valid, university-approved written excuse may 
        receive an "F" for the course at the instructor's option. Discussions 
        will focus on the assigned source readings for that day. Vigorous participation 
        (as contrasted with attendance) will count for 25% of the course grade. 
        Students will also help lead discussion on source readings in rotation.

HONOR 
        CODE: Students are expected to uphold the Western Michigan University 
        standards of Academic Conduct. In particular, no form of cheating or plagiarism 
        will be tolerated (see the Undergraduate Catalogue, 270-273; if you wish 
        further clarification consult the instructor.) Persons violating these 
        standards of conduct in any assignment or exam in this class will receive 
        a minimum penalty of a grade of zero (0) for the assignment, and may receive 
        an "F" for the course at the instructor's option. Know your 
        rights and responsibilities!
Students with Disabilities: 
        You should register your disability with Disabled Student Resources (2112 
        Faunce, 387-2116). You should discuss any accommodation you need with 
        them and they will give you a form listing the approved accommodations 
        to give to me to sign.
Make-Up Exams, Late 
        Papers, Incomplete Work: Students must complete all written work to receive 
        a passing grade. Not taking an exam or failing to turn in the paper will 
        result in an automatic "F" for the course. Make-up exams will 
        be given only for valid, university-approved written excuses, at the instructor's 
        discretion. Make-up exams must be taken as soon as possible after the 
        original test, preferably the day the student returns to class, at a time 
        chosen by the instructor (usually my office hours). Unexcused late papers 
        will be penalized two full letter grades per day they are late (e.g., 
        a "B" paper will become a "D" paper). 
Computer and Intellectual 
        Property Policy: All students must be able to navigate the course website. 
        See the instructor if you have difficulties. Students will not reproduce 
        any portion of course materials (including notes on lecture) without the 
        instructor's express written permission. Return to Top.

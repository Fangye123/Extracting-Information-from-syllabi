**PARENT HANDBOOK**  
As a parent of a UMD student, we appreciate your involvement and support in
your son or daughter's education. Students benefit from family support and
often turn to family members for advice. The Parent Handbook includes
information regarding UMD programs and procedures, campus resources, financial
aid, payment of tuition and fees, and campus safety.  
  
We hope this information will help you give answers when your son or daughter
turns to you with questions.

**Academic Expectations**

**Professors, Students, and Classes** The faculty at the University of
Minnesota Duluth focus their greatest efforts on undergraduate teaching. They
are committed to presenting lectures, facilitating discussion, and supervising
laboratory work that foster intellectual growth and the acquisition of
knowledge. Texts are selected and coursework is assigned and graded with
careful attention to the educational development of the class as a whole and
of the individuals within the class.

In order to learn, students must commit an equal amount of effort. Two hours
of out-of-class study is generally expected for every hour in class. When
students spend less time studying it affects their grades, intellectual
growth, movement to higher level classes, and the value of their degree. It is
the responsibility of each student to do the careful reading, writing, and
thinking necessary to succeed.

At the beginning of each course, every student is given a syllabus that states
the instructor's expectations of students. These expectations typically
include reading, written work, laboratory work, grading procedures, and class
attendance. These are requirements for receiving a satisfactory grade in the
course. If students have questions or concerns about the course expectations
they should be discussed with the instructor when the syllabus is received.

Faculty members post  "office hours" or times they are available to discuss
the course with individual students. If a student has conflicts with an
instructor's office hours, an individual appointment may be made.

**

  * [College Student Affairs Offices**](http://www.d.umn.edu/colleges/) The Student Affairs Office, located in each of UMD's five undergraduate collegiate units, handles information on academic matters pertaining to students of their unit. This includes scholastic standing; academic advising; academic programs; changes of major, adviser, and college; grievance and appeals procedures; honors programs; and undergraduate research. 

Students who have questions about their standing in their college or at UMD
should go to their Student Affairs Office. Curriculum requirements, academic
records, and degree progress information are available for each student
enrolled in the college.

**Academic Advising** Academic advising is coordinated by the Student Affairs
Offices in UMD's five undergraduate collegiate units. The advising structure
for each college differs, but all students are assigned either faculty or
staff advisers. Advisers assist students in developing personal, professional,
and career goals that are challenging, worthy, and realistic. Advisers also
assist students in planning programs of study that help achieve those goals.

Students should make appointments to see their advisers as they plan their
classes for the next semester. Advisers also welcome students if they have
concerns at other times during the year. Encourage your student to get to know
his/her academic adviser and to take full advantage of this valuable resource.

**Registration for Courses and Credits** Course registration takes place one
semester at a time. Each course is assigned a certain number of credits. A
credit is a unit of academic work. Each credit loosely refers to an hour per
week of class or lab time. Most classes are worth 3, 4, or 5 credits.

**Credit Loads** To complete a bachelor's degree in four years, a student
usually needs to take an average of 15 credits per semester. This does not
mean students will be taking exactly 15 credits every semester. The full-time
credit load each semester ranges from 12 to 18 credits, which is typically 3
to 5 courses. If students are receiving the Minnesota State Grant as part of
their financial aid, they must carry a minimum of 15 credits per semester to
receive the _full_ grant.

**Grades** Students are graded A - F for most courses, including minuses (-)
and pluses (+). Some courses are graded S (successful completion of work) and
N (no credit) only, and some courses allow the students to choose A - F or S -
N grading option.

Grades are usually available within a week after the end of the semester.
There are three ways for students to obtain their grades. Students can call
the UMD Student Line (726-8088) for grades, GPA, and total credits, view
grades via the web at <http://www.d.umn.edu/Register/>, or request an
unofficial copy of their transcript at the Campus Center Information Desk.

Transcripts and grades are confidential information and, by law, are not
available to parents or other third parties without written permission from
the student for each request.

**Privacy Act** The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act is a federal law
mandating an institutional policy concerning privacy rights of students. The
act prohibits release of student data (except published directory information)
to persons other than authorized University officials without the student's
written consent. Currently enrolled students may withhold information, except
name, by submitting written notification to the Campus Center Information Desk
by the second week of fall semester.

Students are encouraged to make use of a variety of academic support services
offered at UMD. The following departments offer services that help students
succeed in college and plan careers.

  
**ACADEMIC SUPPORT**

**

  * [The Access Center**](http://www.d.umn.edu/access/)

**

  * [Introduction to College Learning**  
](http://www.d.umn.edu/student/fye/icl.html) Introduction to College Learning,
SSP 1000, is a one credit university-wide orientation course. The course
promotes success by exposing students to information technology and academic

issues.

  
**CAMPUS LIFE**

**

  * [Residential Life** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/housing/)  
Freshmen are not required to live in university housing, however research has
shown that students who live on campus are more active in academic and extra-
curricular activities than commuters, have a lower drop-out rate than other
students, and are generally more satisfied with their college education.

Because student residents live in a community of people who are much like
themselves, residential life provides a unique support system. All university
housing facilities are staffed with trained Resident Advisors (R.A.). The R.A.
is an upper class student who is responsible for a living area within the
housing facility. The R.A. serves as a peer counselor and is ready to listen
to students who have trouble with peers, roommates, classes, or even
homesickness.

The residence halls, suites, and university apartments are located within
walking distance to classes, the library, shopping, athletic facilities, and
campus events.

Information on laundry facilities, what to bring, and what not to bring will
be sent to students from the Housing Office. The Housing Office telephone
number is 218-726-8178.

**

  * [Kirby Student Center** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/kirby/)  
The Kirby Student Center provides services and facilities used by the entire
campus. The Kirby Information Desk cashes checks, sells newspapers, provides
bus schedules, provides campus event schedules, and operates a  "lost and
found." The first floor of Kirby houses two automatic bank tellers, public
telephones, the bookstore, a travel agency, a credit union, and the Student
Activities Office. The Kirby Student Center telephone number is 218-726-7163.

**

  * [Student Activities** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/kirby/)  
There are more than 100 registered student organizations representing a wide
variety of interests at UMD. The activities and programs organized and
sponsored by these groups supplement the educational opportunities found in
the classroom. A directory of student organizations is available on-line at
the above web address. New students are encouraged to respond to ads and
invitations to join the campus groups. Every fall semester the organizations
focus their efforts on reaching out to new students to help them become active
members of campus life. The Student Activities office phone number is
218-726-7169.

**Religious Worship** The UMD Council of Religious Advisors is located in the
Kirby Student Center. Several religious denominations and faiths are
represented on campus, some of which conduct services on campus. There are
also churches and synagogues within walking distance of the campus. New
students have an opportunity to submit an interest form during orientation.

**

  * [Health Services** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/hlthserv/)  
UMD Health Services (HS), located on campus between Lake Superior and Goldfine
Halls, is designed to serve the unique needs of students. HS is open from 8:00
a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday. When HS is not open, students are
directed to nearby urgent care centers or emergency rooms. For general
information or to make an appointment, call Health Services at 218/726-8155.

The student service fee pays for unlimited visits to Health Services including
exams for general illnesses, injuries, physicals, and preventive and
gynecological care. Other services are offered at a reasonable cost and can
often be billed to your insurance companies. These services include
medications, lab, x-ray, immunizations and allergy shots, and elective minor
surgery. HS is able to bill many insurance companies and will assist with the
billing process.

In addition to medical services, HS also offers mental health counseling and
educational events. Students seek counseling for concerns ranging from
roommate problems to depression. Educational events are focused on student
health issues such as alcohol and other drug use, safer sex, safety on campus,
healthy student lifestyles, and more.

Health Services staff includes qualified health professionals and is
accredited by the American Association of Ambulatory Health Care and the
International Association of Counseling Services. All health records are
confidential and cannot be released to parents or other third parties,
including other University departments, without written consent of the
student.  

  
**Tuition and Fees**

**

  * [Paying Tuition** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/sss/registrar/payfees.html)  
A billing statement is mailed to students at the beginning of each semester.
It is important that students update their billing address via the web
registration system. Students will have approximately three weeks from the
date of the billing statement until tuition and fees are due. Late fees will
be charged for payments received after the due date.

The Student Accounts Receivable office manages the billing and payment of
tuition, fees, on-campus housing, and other departmental charges. These
charges may be paid on an installment plan. To be eligible for installment
payments, the minimum installment listed on the billing statement must be paid
by the due date.

Tuition and fees may be paid:  

      * By mail: Mail check or money order and the bottom portion of billing statement to: UMD Cashier's Office; 140 Darland Administration Building; 10 University Drive; Duluth MN 55812-2496  

      * In person: Cashier's windows are located in the lobby of the Darland Administration Building. Hours: 8:30 a.m.-3:30 p.m., Monday-Friday.   

      * Drop box: Deposit check or money order (no cash) along with the bottom portion of billing statement in the payment drop box located next to the Cashier's Office, Darland Administration Building Lobby.  

      * Payment by credit card is not an option.  

**

  * [Financial Aid** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/sss/finaid/)  
Most financial aid payments will be credited electronically to individual
student accounts using the automated Student Accounts Receivable System
(STARS) administered by the Student Accounts Receivable office. If the aid is
more than the student owes, the student will receive a check for the surplus.
Some private scholarships, alternative loans and some agency grants have
checks disbursed to students. These checks may be picked up in the Student
Assistance Center, 21 Campus Center.

UMD participates in the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. These loans are
the same as other loans except that the federal government, rather than a bank
or credit union, is the lender and delivers proceeds electronically through
UMD.

If there are problems processing the financial aid application, or if the
FAFSA or loan application was filed late, the awarded aid might not be
available by the time classes begin. Questions should be directed to the
Student Assistance Center, 21 Campus Center or 218-726-8000.  

**

  * [Costs** ](http://www.d.umn.edu/sss/registrar/tuition_and_fees.html)  
The list shown here includes tuition and fees that typically appear on the
billing statement. **The dollar amounts below reflect 2000-01 per semester
rates for Minnesota residents; tuition and fees for 2001-02 will be determined
this summer by the University Regents.** A billing statement will be mailed to
the student's billing address at the beginning of fall semester.

credits or more have health insurance coverage. Students may waive the
purchase of the University sponsored plan by supplying the name and policy
number of their insurance at the time they register. If the fee appears on the
fee statement it means the student did not waive its purchase. The student
will be covered by the policy and will be held responsible for payment. If
this fee appears on the fee statement and the student does not want to be
covered, he or she must have it removed _before the end of the third week of
the semester_ by supplying proof of other coverage. For more information on

accessibility; students choose whether to contribute each time they register.  
  
_Other fees_  
Special fees are charged for specific courses, such as courses that require
computer lab access, private music lessons, or science courses. See
descriptions in the UMD Catalog.  
**  
Financial Aid Assistance is Available  
**  
UMD's admissions and financial aid staff are committed to assisting new
students in obtaining financial aid. If you have questions, call
1-800-232-1339 or 218-726-7171 or email
[umdadmis@d.umn.edu](mailto:umdadmis@d.umn.edu).

**

  * [Student Employment**  
](http://www1.umn.edu/ohr/jobs/students.html) Student employment information
can be accessed via the student employment web site. Each job posting includes
the name of the hiring department and contact person, a brief position
description, and the minimum qualifications of the position. There are two
types of employment: college work study (qualified applicants are awarded
college work study as part of their financial aid package) and miscellaneous
employment (available to students enrolled in at least six credit hours).  
  
Common student positions include food service workers, office assistants,
custodial staff, and computer and science lab attendants. New students should
keep in mind that they may need to begin in an entry level position with the
potential of moving on to more responsible positions as they gain experience.

**

  * [Continuing Education**  
](http://www.d.umn.edu/uc-d/) Duluth Continuing Education (CE) offers
educational opportunities to members of the local community who are generally
not full-time students. Some undergraduate and master's degrees and selected
certificate programs are offered through CE in partnership with collegiate
units. CE also offers special credit and noncredit conferences and workshops.
Most of the courses CE offers are held in the evening in order to serve people
who work during the day.

Many UMD day-school students also take advantage of CE course offerings.
Although evening courses are listed each semester in the UMD class schedule,
the definitive source for CE classes and procedures is the CE Schedule.

_  
_**Non-Degree Credit Courses  
**  
Listed below are the courses that cannot be counted toward the bachelor's
degree. These courses cover material that is below the level of difficulty
required to meet the University of Minnesota Duluth's standards for bachelor
degree work.  
  
Math 0102 | Euclidean Geometry  
---|---  
SSP 0103  | Basic Mathematics and Introductory Algebra  
  
Non-degree credit courses cover material required to prepare for other
college-level courses. The amount of time and effort they require is
proportional to the credits assigned to them.  
  
Non-degree credits appear on a student's transcript in brackets. They _will
not_ be counted in the total earned UMD credits or toward graduation and
course grades _will not_ be calculated into the student's grade point average
(GPA).  
  
The credit for non-degree courses may be used in determining financial aid
eligibility. The credit also may be used to meet intercollegiate athletic
eligibility requirements if the student also earns 24 degree credits during
the academic year. Student athletes must discuss the terms of eligibility with
the Athletic department.  

  
**Campus Safety**

**Personal Safety**  
The campus is patrolled by uniformed police officers seven days a week, 24
hours a day. They serve the campus safety and security needs and are available
around the clock to respond to emergencies. If the need arises, students may
contact Campus Police, Monday - Friday between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. at
726-7000 or 343-4670. During non-office hours, students should call 911 to
request Campus Police assistance.

UMD has very little trouble with violent crime; however, since theft is a
problem on many college campuses, it is recommended that students mark all
personal property. Items such as purses and backpacks should not be left
unattended and valuable property should never be left inside a car, even if
locked. Students living in the residence halls are encouraged to carry their
own personal property or renter's insurance if they are not covered by their
parents' homeowner's insurance. They are also urged to keep doors locked at
all times to prevent thefts or unauthorized entries.

UMD's  "Safewalk" Escort service is available Sunday through Thursday from 8 -
11 p.m. Volunteers can be reached at 218-726-6100 or in Kirby Plaza 121 to
accompany students within three miles of campus.

**Student Right-to-Know Act**  
The University of Minnesota upholds the _Student Right-to-Know Act_ , which
ensures that information related to graduation rates, athletically related
student aid, disciplinary proceeding outcomes, and campus security policy and
crime statistics be disclosed to current students and to any applicant for
enrollment. The UMD brochure _Campus Security Act_ is available upon request.  

  
**Duluth Community**

**Motels and Hotels in Duluth** Duluth is a popular tourist attraction,
especially during the summer and fall months. Therefore, when you're planning
a trip to Duluth to help your son or daughter move into the residence halls or
to attend Parents' and Family Weekend, be sure to make your reservations
early. For a complete list of motels/hotels in the Duluth and surrounding
areas, contact the Duluth Convention and Visitor's Bureau (1-800-4-Duluth) or

**TRANSITION STRATEGIES**

**Coping Strategy #1** **_" Major? I've had six in the last two months!"_**  
Deciding on a career or college major is a process that takes time. More than
35% of UMD freshmen enter as "undecided" and many students change majors
during their first year. If your son or daughter is undecided about his or her
major or career direction, **encourage your son or daughter to...**

      * use UMD's Liberal Education Program to explore interests  

      * use UMD's Career Information Center to explore how majors relate to careers  

      * after doing initial exploration, make an appointment to see a career counselor in Career Services, Campus Center 21  
**Coping Strategy #2** **_" I got a C- on my first exam!"_**  
It's not unusual for grades to drop from standards set during high school. It
takes time for students to adjust to the differences between high school and
college coursework. Students often need to actively pursue information on how
to improve. **Encourage your son or daughter to...**  

      * talk to the professor and/or teaching assistant (office hours listed on syllabus)  

      * improve time management skills (maintain a weekly calendar and organize detailed daily plans)  

      * utilize Tutoring Center services, 40 Campus Center  

      * form a study group 
      * attend study skills and test taking workshops in the fall 
      * consider enrolling in UMD College Study Strategies, SSP 1054  **Coping Strategy #3** **_" My roommate's an alien from Mars!"_**  
Whether best friends from high school or perfect strangers, roommates will
experience ups and downs. As much as possible, students are encouraged to
solve their own problems. Cooperative living comes about through each
roommate's careful efforts. **Encourage your son or daughter to...**  

      * BEFORE moving in together, discuss potential conflict areas (community versus personal property; neatness versus pig sty; early bird versus night owl) and set up a room use schedule (times for... being alone, no visitors, quiet, television on/off, etc.)  

      * discuss conflicts as they arise and negotiate solutions BUT don't turn a molehill into a mountain  

      * gain advice from an upperclass student (R.A. is a valuable resource)  

      * if conflicts escalate, seek out campus resources (Health Services counseling staff and residence life personnel)  
**Coping Strategy #4** **_" I miss the wallpaper in my bedroom!"_**  
Homesickness is a natural feeling for many students living away from home.
Even after the initial transition period, homesickness might continue to
surface at particularly stressful times. Students often call home for
encouragement and reassurance while working to find their niche in their new
environment. Students who work through these feelings experience a high level
of personal growth and development. **Encourage your son or daughter to...**  

      * take an active role in making friends (leave residence hall door open, introduce self to new acquaintances, form study groups, hang out where students are, join other students in the dining center)  

      * get involved in campus activities (meet students with common interests through student organizations and intramural sports) 
      * limit weekend trips home 
      * if feelings persist, seek support through UMD Counseling Services

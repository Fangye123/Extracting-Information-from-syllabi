**Nationalism (Russian and Eurasian Studies 330s)**

This course is designed to study the nature of nationalism, particularly in
Europe in the second half of the 20th century. We will explore the themes and
issues that comprise nationalism, such as language, history, religion and
territory, look at different types of national identity, how they drive people
to political violence, and what strategies states use to deal with ethnic
conflict. Early on in the course (second week), the class will divide into
four groups. Each group will begin work on a particular case-study. Two of
those case studies must deal with Central and Eastern Europe and two with
Western Europe and North America (in the past students have looked at the
former Yugoslavia, Ukraine, Canada, Spain, Ireland, Wales and the former
Soviet Union). Emphasis will be on mechanisms for achieving peace through
power-sharing, autonomy or partition. The group will be responsible - after
consultation with me \- for bibliographies, the division of labor between
different members of the group, the themes to be addressed and the overall
cohesion of the group's presentation. I want to know by our fourth class which
case study has been chosen by each group. At the sixth class each student will
give me a short bibliography and summary of the readings she has done on her
case study and will outline what in her view, the major issues are. Weeks nine
to twelve will be reserved for each group of students to make a presentation
about their case study. Based on her contribution to the group case study, a
student will write a 15-20 page research paper. By 17th April, l want to see a
draft of the student's paper.

Evaluation will be on the basis of participation and presentations in class
(35%) a book review (30%) and the final research paper of 15-20 pages (35%).
We will discuss how you can get the best out of your group presentation and
should students require computer display facilities, they should let me know
early on so a classroom can be arranged. This is a speaking class and we will
have a speaking mentor who will be working with you on your oral
presentations. Her name is Indika Sananyake , her telephone No. is X4299 and
email Iksenana@mtholyoke.edu

## HISTORY 425-B  
EARLY AMERICA - REVOLUTION TO REPUBLIC

### MR. HOWARD B. FEDRICK  
SYLLABUS FALL 2001

## INITIAL OBSERVATIONS and OVERVIEW of the COURSE

#### Too frequently Americans are inclined to mythologize the period 1763-1815
in which the Atlantic colonies of Great Britain broke their bonds with that
"sceptered isle" and embarked upon "the great experiment" in self governance.
As a result the truly heroic and the truly human become lost in a whirling
blur of red, white, and blue banners which would suggest that from the moment
the first English settler arrived in Jamestown nothing was more desirable than
to be rid of "the King and his damn'd Parliament". Nothing could be further
from the truth. And - it is the true story which this course will endeavor to
examine.

#### To provide structure, this study will utilize a chronological frame and
trace the growth and development of the revolutionary movement within the
colonies, the political and military confrontations between the colonies and
the mother country, and the crises and confrontations which led to the
establishment of a highly politicized American republic. Of necessity, this
study must begin with a general commentary on the character of British North
America pre-1763 and the nature of imperial relations.

#### Ours is a study of ideas, of institutions, of individuals and of the
influences to which they were subject as well as the influences which they
exerted and, perhaps, still exert. It is a study of leadership - individual
and collective - exercised in colonial reaction to Parliamentary legislation,
in defining the proper constitutional position of the colonies, in meeting the
challenge of the War of Independence, in creating a new structure of
government and making it work. It is a study of power - political and economic
- and how it was to be channeled, shared, and exercised within a federal
republic. It is a study of the transformation of society and culture from
colonial to American. This is a study of the first American "civil war" and
the period of "construction" (rather than reconstruction) which took place at
the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries.

#### Properly approached and undertaken, this course should provide
celebration and critique. It examines achievements and failures; triumphs and
tragedies; hopes and frustrations. It cannot lay claim to prognostication yet
it should offer guidance and direction in shaping the future. The study
utilizes static data to evaluate and to analyze the dynamic forces and ideas
by which women and men have shaped the American story of their times and of
our times in this new century. As a matter of fact, it is the study of how men
and women created the United States of America!

## GOALS/OBJECTIVES:

####

  1. To identify the significant ideologies and philosophies which encouraged the America Revolution as well as those which informed the establishment of the American republic; 

####

  2. To identify the more significant men and women responsible for creating and sustaining the American Revolution and the early American republic; 

####

  3. To identify the principal social, economic, and cultural forces which shaped this period of American history; 

####

  4. To identify the impact which the crises and confrontations in this period had on the growth and development of American history, short term and long term; 

####

  5. Finally - to evaluate the ideas, institutions, and individuals studied as a means to better understand and to evaluate the character of the American republic as well as the cross currents in the republic. 

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS

### REQUIRED TEXT READINGS

_

#### The Glorious Cause, The American Revolution 1763-1789._ Robert
Middlekauff. Oxford University Press: New York. 1982.  
_Founding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation._ Joseph Ellis. Alfred A.
Knopf: New York. 2000.  
_The Declaration of Independence_  
_The Constitution of the United States_

#### **** It is highly recommended that each student have a basic American
history text available for reading and consultation; the time frame of the
course precluded selection of a text which would "neatly" cover the time to be
considered. Any of the texts (Norton, Boyer, Murrin, or Davidson) used in CORE
130 would suffice.

### REQUIRED COLLATERAL READINGS (Reserve Shelf - Library)

#### Several collateral readings will be assigned during the semester to
complement the text and lecture. These readings will be on reserve in the D.
Leonard Corgan Library. They are to be completed prior to discussion of the
material in class lectures.

### SUPPLEMENTAL INTERNET RESOURCES

#### To assist in gathering a knowledge and understanding of many issues in
the text as well as in classroom discussions and as an adjunct to your own
research I recommend use of the Early America Website which you might wish to
access and use as is appropriate. Access:[EARLY AMERICAN REPUBLIC
1763-1815](revolution.html) (www.kings.edu/hbfedric/revolution.html)

### WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS

#### Two (2) brief papers/reports will be assigned. Guidelines for each
paper/report will be distributed as appropriate. Exploration of various
original research resources including the library and the World Wide Web will
be encouraged in the completion of these assignments. You will be expected to
demonstrate proficiency in applying the writing and critical thinking
developed in CORE 110 and CORE 100. All students will be expected to submit
papers in typed or word processed form. Handwritten work will NOT be accepted.
Papers not submitted on time will be severely penalized; the highest possible
grade will be a "C". The second paper will also require oral presentation,
discussion, and defense in the second half of the semester. A schedule will be
established for this purpose at an appropriate time.

### ONLINE DISCUSSION and RESEARCH PROJECT ASSIGNMENT

#### It will be the obligation of each student to participate in the online
discussion group which will be established. Review and research and
presentation of a written critique of the Early American Web Site will be
expected.

### TESTS

#### There will be three (3) written tests given during the semester including
the final examination. The first two tests will be announced in class at least
ten (10) days in advance. The third (final) examination will be given
according to the Registrar's examination schedule. The tests will be based on
the lectures and assigned reading materials. The general structure of the
tests will be essay. Each test will be non-comprehensive and will review the
most recent materials covered.

### CLASSROOM PARTICIPATION

#### Regular participation - asking or responding to questions, volunteering
one's own ideas or arguments, sharing evidence - is EXPECTED from each
student! Participation will be weighed positively in the overall semester
grade evaluation as a growth/development factor. It is not my intention to
lecture during every class period. Background in CORE 130 as well as the
assigned readings should provide each student with the raw materials from
which active classroom discussions can develop.

### ATTENDANCE

#### You are expected to attend classroom lectures/discussions on a regular
basis. The rules of the College regarding class attendance will be followed
strictly. You are responsible for all materials discussed in lectures and
classroom discussions. MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE ABSENCE of THREE (3) - excused OR
unexcused. Three consecutive absences or a pattern of absence over a three
week period will initiate an Excessive Absence Report to the College Student
Services Office. It is to be correctly assumed that it will be impossible to
receive a grade which is higher than the percentage of days attended without
significant reasons. Absence on the day of a scheduled test will not be
excused unless a serious reason has been explained to the professor (in
advance, if possible) and arrangements for a make-up test are made within five
(5) class days of the scheduled test. It is YOUR RESPONSIBILITY to arrange the
make-up with the professor. It should not be presumed that absence on a test
day will automatically permit a re-test.

### SEMESTER GRADE EVALUATION

#### The determination of the final semester grade will be based on the
successful completion of all requirements for the course using numerical
values totaling 110% points as follows:  
Tests: Test I, II, III - 60% total (20% each)  
Written Assignments - 30% total (15% each)  
Web Site Research and Critique Assignment - 10%  
Participation/Discussion - 5%  
The professor's grading scale to be used is as follows:  
A+ = 98     A = 95    A- = 92  
B+ = 88    B = 85    B- = 82  
C+ = 78    C = 75    C- = 72  
D+ = 68    D = 65    F = 59

### OFFICE CONTACT / OFFICE HOURS

#### Learning is not achieved only within the confines of a classroom. To that
end be advised of the following:

####

  * Personal consultations are welcome and encouraged. Submission of "rough drafts" of writing assignments is highly desirable as is consultation regarding research for writing assignments and/or test reviews.

GRADING



150-250 pts. Weekly Problem Sets - 10-20 pts each



80-120 pts. Miscellaneous assignments 5-25 points each.



150 pts. Lab notebook - graded 3 times, 50 pts each time.



400 pts. Four midterm exams.



200 pts. Final exam.





Participation (quantity and quality) in classroom and laboratory activities
will be used to boost the final grades of individuals with borderline point
totals.



Grades will be based on percentage of total possible points according to the
scale: A = 90-100, B = 80-90, etc.



If you are going to miss an exam, it is essential that you contact Dr.
Schwaegerle as soon as possible to discuss your excuse. Unexcused absences
from exams will be recorded as zero.



If you are going to miss lab, you must contact your teaching assistant as soon
as possible to make arrangements for making up the exercises you will miss. If
you miss a lab and don't make arrangements, you are individually responsible
for mastering material and completing assignments made during that lab.
Unexcused absence from a lab exercise will be recorded as a zero.



Academic dishonesty - The UAF Honor Code is presented on page 22 of the 00-01
Undergraduate Catalog. No collaboration among students will be allowed on
exams and quizzes, and although we will work together in collecting,
analyzing, and interpreting data, no collaboration is permitted in writing of
lab reports and lab assignments. Copying or paraphrasing another student's
writing is a violation of the Honor Code. Evidence of academic dishonesty will
be presented to the University Disciplinary and Honor Code Committee and may
result in an F for the course and/or expulsion from the University.

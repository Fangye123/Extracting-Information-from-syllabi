This course will chart the development and history of Rock Music from its
earliest roots to current movements, and will introduce students to the many
styles and trends that exist in this very rich period.  Though Rock Music is
often regarded as a purely American art-form, the course will consider Rock
Music from throughout the Western World, with special concentration on the
United States and the United Kingdom.

* Students will gain a knowledge of many different styles of Rock Music and their value both to the History of Rock and also as important musical contributions to the modern world.
* Students will learn to use research techniques to find information pertinent to the course.
* Students will learn to listen objectively to Rock Music, employing analytical techniques and vocabulary.
* Students will gain an appreciation of the richness of creativity that has taken place in this field during the final half of the Twentieth Century.
* We will also look to the new century and try to predict what possibilities lie ahead for music and for future generations.
  


    
    


**_Evaluation and Grading_**

_Examinations_ (60%): There will be three exams during the period of the
course, each one covering the previous classes' worth of lecture material and
assigned reading.   Each exam counts for the same number of marks, and each
bears equal weighting in determining a student's final grade.   Each exam is
non-cumulative.

Each exam will contain multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, and
true/false questions. There will also be a listening portion in each exam, in
which students will be required to answer questions based on tracks which we
have studied in class.

Students who miss exams due to absence may be allowed to take a make-up exam,
providing this is discussed with the instructor, preferably before the
scheduled exam.  The dates for the exams are listed in the syllabus outline
below.

_Course Paper_ (40%): Students will be required to submit a course paper
(April 29th for section 001, April 30th for sections 002/003).   Details of
the requirements for this paper will be given to students at an appropriate
time during the course.

_Attendance_ : Attendance is very important for this class.  Students should
aim to attend every class, although two unexcused absences will be allowed
without penalty.  Each unexcused class missed above the two allowed will lead
to points being deducted from the student's aggregate score and will therefore
affect the student's grade. Absences may be excused according to standard
University procedure, and will therefore not count against the final grade, if
both of the following conditions are met: (a) the student must bring
documented proof of the absence (doctor's note, court summons, wedding
invitation etc.) to a subsequent class, (b) the student must show the
instructor a photocopy of the notes from the missed class.  The following is
the Department of Music policy on types of absence which may be excused:

> 1) Illness or injury when the student is unable to attend class;  
> 2) Religious observance where the nature of the observance prevents the
student from attending class;  
> 3) Participation in University activities at the request of University
authorities;  
> 4) Compelling verifiable circumstances beyond the control of the student.

_Grading_ : Grades will be determined according to the cumulative points
gained in each of the three areas above (examinations, course paper,
attendance) as follows: 90-100% = A; 80-89.9% = B; 70-79.9% = C; 60-69.9% = D;
0-59.9% = F. The instructor does not use the +/- system of grading except in
rare circumstances where a borderline grade merits a + grade, e.g. a final
mark of 88% or 89% may be given a B+, but sometimes this mark may possibly be
given an A grade if the student has demonstrated a good attitude towards the
class, a perfect or near-perfect attendance record, and a positive involvement
in class discussion.

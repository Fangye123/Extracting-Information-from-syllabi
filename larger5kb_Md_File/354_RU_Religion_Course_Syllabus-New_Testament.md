840:346 Sexuality in the Western Religious Traditions  
Fall, 2001  
TTh6  
James T. Johnson  
Loree 134, DC; 932-9637; jtj@rci.rutgers.edu

_Shape of the course:_ This course is designed to explore the central ideas
and problems in the main line of the western Christian (Catholic and
Protestant) and Jewish normative traditions on sexuality. At the same time,
the course is also meant to provide a view, from the particular perspective
offered by the ethics of sex, into how these major western religious
traditions deal with ethics in general.

About two-thirds of the course will follow the development of the core
traditions from their biblical and classical beginnings up to now. The final
third will take up several special problems posed by conflict between the
traditions and contemporary culture. There will be an exam in the form of what
I call a directed paper (you can think of it as a take-home essay test) at the
one-third mark, the first of October, and at the two-thirds mark, the first of
November. A third directed paper will be assigned the last day of class and be
due during the final exam period in lieu of a final exam. It will cover the
last third of the course as well as reflecting the course as a whole.

_Office hours:_ Thursday 9:00-12:00 or by arrangement.

_Readings for the course:_ You should buy the following books, which have been
ordered at the Douglass-Cook Coop: Rachel Biale, _Women and Jewish Law_ ; Lisa
Sowle Cahill, _Between the Sexes_ ; and Thomas C. Fox, _Sexuality and
Catholicism_. Other books for the course, marked (R) below, are on reserve at
the Alexander Library undergraduate reserve desk. (A copy of the reserve list
is attached for your reference). These reserve books are in short supply, and
I strongly urge you to make personal copies of the readings as you go along in
order to keep the books available to everyone in the class and so you will
have them in hand to mark up and to review at exam time.

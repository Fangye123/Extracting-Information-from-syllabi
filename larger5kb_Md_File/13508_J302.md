**_Wednesday, Jan. 23_ : **Introduction to the course and discussion on its
purpose and value.

**_Monday, Jan. 28_ : **Class cancelled.

**_Wednesday, Jan. 30_ : **Anna gave a lecture about different analyses of
media coverage, including:

1\. NewsWatch (http://newswatch.sfsu.edu): conducted a study of news photos
from 9/11 and found that the subjects were overwhelmingly Caucasion  
2\. National Association of Hispanic Journalists "Network Brownout 2001"
(http://www.nahj.org/pdf/brownout.pdf): looked at all news stories on the
major national networks from 2001 (ABC, CBS and NBC). Out of the 16,000
stories broadcast, only 84 included Latinos/Hispanics. Many of these,
regardless of the topic, had salsa music playing in the background.  
3\. CNN: fired several minority employees, using the excuse that they were
experiencing budget cuts. After several journalism organizations sent them
letters complaining about their unfair actions, CNN quickly hired Connie
Chung.  
4\. Reading packet "Research on Race and News": J-School project that examined
minorities in the newsrooms, etc..

We also watched a video on racial stereotyping in the media and how such
stereotyping shapes the public's biases.  

**_Monday, Feb. 4_ : **Class discussion of case studies.

**_Wednesday, Feb. 6_ : **Jacqui drew on her experience at _The Seattle Times_
to discuss the way in which one's fault lines determine how one perceives a
news story. She outlined **seven framing principles** that may impact the way
a journalist tells a story:

**1\. Bias** (e.g. do you know your own biases and how they effect your
subject  
choices, research, interviewing, storytelling and editing?)

**2\. Perspective** ( how does your point of view influence the way you tell a  
story? Are you aware of how those from different cultural perspectives might  
perceive a piece?)

**3\. Audience** ( who are you trying to reach and are you speaking a language
that  
your primary audience can understand?)

**4\. Language** ( what social and political values shape language? who
controls  
language and to what end?)

**5\. Balance** (does the weight of coverage over time reflect the fullness of
a  
subject or culture?)

**6\. Historical context** (are you aware of the history behind an event or
issue?)

**7\. Ethics** ( have you considered all the stakeholders? will your story do
harm?  
what steps have you taken to mitigate the harm?)

**_Monday, Feb. 18:_**

Guest speaker:  
Dr. Osei Appiah from Greenlee School of Journalism and Communication, Iowa
State University

Lecture:  
Depictions of Ethnic Minorities in Advertising

Targeting audiences perpetuates stereotypes. Advertisers realize that a
diverse world requires diversity in messages, images, and characters. Overt
stereotyping in advertising belongs to the past. However, there still are
negative depictions of minorities in advertising.

**1\. Negative Depictions:**  
Blacks appear in :  
\- minor or background roles  
\- large racially integrated groups  
\- short time periods  
\- stereotypical scenes and occupations  
\- subordinate positions  
Research shows that the percentage of ads featuring blacks is very low
compared to the percentage of black readership of the medium containing the
ads.  
Example video commercials:  
\-  "Just for Feet" shoe commercial  
\- Smirnoff "Africa"  
\- Fox Sports "Olympics"

**2\. Positive Depictions:**  
Ads showing blacks in positive roles.  
Example video commercials:  
\- Kobe Bryant and McDonalds  
\- Shaq  "My Book"  
\- AT&T "Vietnam"

**_Wednesday, Feb. 20:_**

Lecture by Jacqui Banaszynski

**Topic: Media coverage of gays, particularly gays with AIDS.**  
(Jacqui stressed that the information she presented is applicable to the
coverage of other minority communities.)

Jacqui summarized the history of how the media have covered the gay community
and AIDS. She wanted students to have a "frame of reference" in regards to
this topic.

In addition, she stressed the importance of understanding that every community
and/or issue (such as the Civil-Rights Movement) can also be examined as an
arc of coverage that has happened over time.

Jacqui gave specific examples of how historical events and popular culture
play a part in increasing awareness, elevating discussion and eventually
helping the public to become more comfortable with certain issues. In regards
to AIDS, Jacqui sited Rock Hudson's death, the movie Philadelphia and cable
shows like "Six Feet Under."

After summarizing AIDS coverage in the media, Jacqui presented her Pulitzer
Prize-winning series, "Aids in the Heartland." Jacqui narrated the piece and
showed the accompanying photos.

Referring to points she made in her last lecture, Jacqui talked about how she
tried to "frame" her subjects by showing them as "everyday, normal people."
She explained how she did this by carefully selecting words and situations
that would help show commonality with her audience.

In addition to framing, Jacqui discussed the parameters she for selecting her
subjects. She also answered questions about objectivity and how it relates to
projects in which reporter is "fully immersed."

**_Monday, Feb. 25:_**

Lecture presentation by the MU faculty members Ron Kelley, Esther Thorson and
Dean Dean Mills

Topic: Media content analysis titled "Race and the News," researched by
faculty members above plus prof. Glen Cameron, 1996-2001.

Research subject: three newspapers ( _L.A. Times, Minneapolis-St. Paul Pioneer
Press, Minneapolis Star Tribune_ ) and one TV station (WCCO-TV).

Method: sampling, in-depth interviews, content analysis, and double-feedback
model (critiques from informants)

Focus: how do these media deal with diversity coverage?  

Esther Thorson:  
-findings: men/women representation: 4-5:1  
-Latino population in L.A.: 40%; actually reported in the newspaper: 15-20%: highly undercovered  
-African Americans - very low coverage, stereotyped in entertainment, over represented in crimes  
-Impact: this study made the people in the newsroom rethink of news, rethink of roles of others in news. rediscover new sources

Dean Mills (Dean of J-school):  
-Why do we have to cover all groups? Why do we cover at all?  
1\. Wecan lose readership and potential advertisers  
2\. It's a matter of community trust  
3\. It's an injustice to the member of the community  
4\. It's a social justice reason - fairly representing all groups is "good
journalism."

Other points:  
-A diverse market requires diverse coverage  
-Social class becomes a line of demarcation; rurual and working-class are very undercovered.  
-Any attemps to look at diverse newsrooms' influences on coverage of diverse communities depended on the socialization in the newsroom.  
-Reality: women and minorities are not much involved in the decision making process at management level.

**Native-American Videos**

Census 2000 Ad Campaign by G&G Advertising in New Mexico as an effort to reach
Native-American/American-Indian population

"In Whose Honor?"  
Charlene Teters vs. University of Illinois  
Debate about the use of American-Indian religious ceremony, characters,
costumes and artifacts as mascots. Examples include Univ. of Illinois' Chief
Illiniwek, Washington Redskins, Kansas City Chiefs, etc..  
Are such symbols used to honor American-Indians, or do they just mock, distort
or trivialize the culture?

**_Monday, Mar. 4:_**

Lecture on People With Disabilites (P.W.D.)

\- 9.7 million. people with disabilities (p.w.d.) can't work.  
\- 7.2 million pwd are limited in their work.  
\- Most p.w.d. have to find supplemental insurance because they use up
standard insurance quickly.  
\- About 46percent of p.w.d. in Boone County are unemployed; 34 percent in Mo,
26 percent in U.S.

Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)  
"No qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such
disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefit of,
or be subjected to discimination in federally funded programs and activities."

History shows:  
\- states have denied p.w.d. the right to live in communities--forced
institutionalization.  
\- "feeble-minded" have been denied the right to vote.  
\- p.w.d. have been kept from traveling, having kids and/or caring for kids.  
\- p.w.d. have been denied full access to courts (jury duty).  
\- children with disabilities have been excluded from public education.  
\- hate crimes continue.  
\- mainstream culture fears and doesn't understand p.w.d.

**_Monday, Mar. 11:_**

**Topic: Disability Panel**

Ms. Hammer works in the MU Office of Disability Services  
Ms. Walker is a senior pre-med student who plans to go into Psychiatry

Question and Answer session:

**Q.** Is the word  "disabled" offensive?

**A.** No, it's better than the word  "handicapped." The word "handicapped"
tends to have a negative connotation and it's seen as less acceptable. When
describing a person with a disability, always mention the person first, and
the disability second. Don't say, "A disabled person." Instead, say "A person
with a disability."

**Q.** How can a journalist avoid misquoting a person with a speech
impediment?

**A.** Ms. Hammer responded, saying that it's best to tell the person you
didn't understand them and to simply ask them if they could repeat what they
said. It is also acceptable to have the person write it down. A reporter
should always check the quote before putting it in print.

**Q.** Should a journalist ask about a disability or hold back?

**A.** Ms. Walker responded, saying that if a disability is not relevant to an
interview, a journalist should not focus on it.

**Q.** Does the MU Office of Disability Services offer any seminars/training?

**A.** Yes. A seminar was recently held as a  "Brown Bag" seminar in the
J-School. Also, Disability Awareness Week is coming up. It will try to
heighten awareness of disabilities on campus.

**Q.** What is the ADA definition of disabled? Does it include diseases and
health conditions?

**A.** Yes, if a disease significantly affects major life activities and a
person has functional limitations due to that health condition, it is
considered a disability.

**Q.** How do you feel about media coverage of people with disabilities?

**A.** Ms. Walker responded, saying that she dislikes always seeing the
"angry disabled people" on television. She would prefer to see more coverage
of people with real issues in normal settings. Journalists should avoid
portraying a person with a disability as pitiful, angry or sickly.

**Q.** Are there local issues that could be covered?

**A.** Yes. For instance, universal design (making everything equally
accessible) is a challenge.  
Transportation is especially difficult.

**Q.** What are some positive and negative things to remember when
interviewing a person with a disability?

**A.** Positive-when interviewing a person in a wheelchair, it helps to be eye
level by sitting down or kneeling. Negative-don't lean on a person's
wheelchair, crutches, etc. A person's wheelchair is part of their personal
space; it's an extension of the person. Also, don't always assume that a
person needs help. Independence is important. It is polite to ask if a person
needs help, but don't  
automatically do things such as opening doors, etc.

**_Wednesday, Mar. 13:_**

**Topic: Terry Tazioli's presentation and discussion of the "Whitegirl" story
**

**_Monday, Mar. 18:_**

**Midterm Exam**

**_Wednesday, Mar. 20:_**

**Topic: Fritz Cropp's presentation on advertising in Asia**

Prof. Fritz Cropp lectured on the ways in which cultural values (of target
markets) impact the aesthetics and the message of advertisements.
Specifically, he showed video clips of ads shown in Asia, designed by foreign
firms and firms from the countries in question.

He emphasized the wide variety of Asian cultures and the ways in which ads
differ according to the sensibilities of the culture. For instance, in Japan,
humor and entertainment value areoften prized above the hard sell of a
product.

In order to successfully advertise in a foreign market, you must be aware of
different values and be thoughtful about your messages and how they might be
received culturally.

**_Monday, Apr 1:_**

Lecture by Jacqui Banaszynski

**Topic: Immigration in the United States**

Banaszynski began the lecture by giving some perspective on the topic of
immigration in the United States. She reminded the class "essentially we are
all immigrants in the United States." She reminded the class of the importance
of this perspective and said problems arise when we forget this and politicize
the subject of immigration.

Throughout the lecture, Banaszynski showed several newspaper pictures, used
quotes/poems (including the quote from the Statue of Liberty, "Give me your
tired, your poor ") and looked closely at specific words used when dealing
with the subject of immigration. Banaszynski used all of these examples to
show the continuing debate surround immigration and how it is viewed in the
United States. Banaszynski's main point was to enforce that there is a long
history of immigration in the United States and the debate surrounding it is
still very complicated and often becomes politicized.

In addition, Banaszynski used specific pictures and words to show how
immigration is often interpreted from a very personal point of view that stems
from individual perception. As a result, Banaszynski stressed the importance
of journalists being aware of how they are "framing" immigration stories. She
encouraged great attentiveness to word choice and picture selection and the
thoughts that they can evoke.

**An example of the words Banaszynski used to highlight this point are as
follows** :  
-Migrant worker  
-Undocumented worker  
-Illegal immigrant  
-Illegal alien  
-Guest worker

Banaszynski challenged the class to think about language and how particular
care needs to be given when asking questions and reporting stories on
immigration.

Lastly, she encouraged students to read the material from the Seattle Times,
"Under Two Flags," in the course reading packet to gain more understanding
about her lecture.

**_Wednesday, Apr. 3:_**

**Topic: The Latino/Hispanic minority in the U.S.**

-There are over 30 million Latinos in the U.S. according to Census 2000 data. The lecture covered the variety of countries where Latinos come from (Spain, Mexico, Latin American countries) and also the different ways of referring to them: Latinos, Hispanics, Chicanos, etc. 

-The majority of Hispanics in the U.S, however, are of Mexican origin. The lecture continued with the presentation of the U.S.  
states with highest and fastest growing Latino population. Spanglish, a mix of
Spanish and English, is becoming widely used.  

-Where does Missouri stand as far as the Hispanic population goes? The Census data present the increase in Missouri's Latino population and relatively young age this growing minority has. The lecture ended with local coverage discussing the changes in society that have to be made in order to accommodate an increasing number of non-English speakers.

**_Monday, Apr. 8:_**

**Video: Slaying the Dragon**

-Whites played most Asian roles partly because it wasn't acceptable for Asians and whites to kiss in movies.

-Chinese men were typically portrayed as cruel and lustful. Chinese woman were peasant like and submissive.

-In the movie "Good Earth", a Chinese wife is portrayed as a good woman because she allows a mistress to live with them.

-In the 1950's, when Communism became the enemy, the Japanese became the good guys and Chinese became the bad guys. 

-The Japanese Geisha were frequently portrayed in moves. They catered to the pleasures of men. Women were seen as passive, docile and submissive to men.

-In 1948, laws prohibiting interracial relationships were struck down state by state.

-The movie "Sianara" was the first to depict interracial relationships between white man and a Japanese girl.

-The implication became that white men have a right to be with woman of all races.

-The role of Susie Wong became a role model for other Asian women characters \- cute, sexy and subservient.

-An Asian musical in 1962 involved 2 female characters: MayLee - was loyal and submissive; LinLoo - was sensuous and untrustworthy

The image was one-dimensional. It suggested that women couldn't be sensuous
and trustworthy.

In the 1960's, Chinatowns all over American became very popular and
profitable.

Asians were stereotyped as the "model minority". The implication was the
blacks were aggressive in their pursuit of civil rights, while Asians were
more quiet and accepting of their position in society.

War movies with Asian backdrops depicted Asian woman as pleasure objects for
soldiers.

During the Vietnamese War, woman from that country replaced Chinese and
Japanese woman as sex objects.

Emerald Yeh, an anchorwoman in San Francisco, says those women who fill the
Asian stereotype get the jobs. CNN wanted her to look more like Connie Chung-
more exotic.

A professor from San Francisco State University said that that a common idea
was that it was "safer to hire an Asian" because they were hardworking and
complaint.

Yeh said that Asian men have been stereotyped as wimps.  

**_Wednesday, Apr. 10:_**

**Topic: Prof. Jan Colbert's presentation on men's magazines**

We looked at magazine designs and examples of men's magazines such as _Maxim,
Men's Journal, MH18, FHN,_ and _Detail_ s. Most men's magazines contain sex,
drinking and violence as subject matter. Particularly, Prof. Colbert pointed
out repetitive patterns of garbage and violence in men's magazines. She also
talked about the colors the magazines use and the celebrity interviews in
which female celebrities are more about appearance than intelligence. Many
women we saw on men's magazines were nearly naked. She talked about five
stereotypes and last, she showed the early and later issues of _Details_
magazine, which almost went bankrupt and struggled to regain their circulation
early this year.

**Five Stereotypes:**  
**1.** Managed Stereotype - doing the same thing but adding more color to it.
Characters may do the stereotypical things such as waving flags, but this
time, editors can manage to have the subject be a person of color.  
**2.** Sybaritic Stereotype - exoticizing and polarizing things.  
**3.** Polarized Stereotype - Things are divided as black and white, for and
against.  
**4.** Generic Stereotype - Not stereotyping any people with color or action,
but showing the generic way of depicting certain things. For example, editors
can show flags with no person, to have a generic solution.  
**5.** Symbolic Anhihilation - Anything that's not there. Looking for the
things that are not there. For example, women were not represented in the NY
Times for a long time.

**_Monday, Apr. 15:_**

**Topic: Tad Bartimus discusses international reporting and her 30+ years of
journalism experience.**  

**_Wednesday, Apr. 17:_**  

**Topic: Prof. Greeley Kyle discusses the images of African Americans in TV
news.**  

\- Two things draw attention in visual communication: color & motion.  
\- Bias entails value judgment to intentionally distort representation of
facts.  
\- We need to open our eye and truthfully see the world around us as it is.  
\- Tune into your environment.  
\- We need to see the bigger picture.  
\- Video examples: young men in prison; gangs in Memphis, TN  
\- Watch what images we put with writing.

_**Monday, Apr. 22:**_

**Topic: Prof. Betty Winfield on media portrayals of women**

-She showed 9/11 video montage that was ran at Faurot Field. The video shows predominantly white males and only one woman.

-She discussed what has been written about women.

-She discussed her research on coverage of First Lady "wannabes."

Images can be powerful and stereotypical. Sometimes women seem to be
invisible. By omitting women, the media make a statement. Often women in power
are criticized because many feel their power is "illegitimate." In order to
criticize, references are often made to their age and sexuality. Often they
are labeled as "domineering, scheming, or as a bitch."

Many times coverage of the wives of political figures is framed. **There are 4
common frames:**

**1.** Escort role-Associated with a man who wants to be or is president. The
wife is only someone to accompany him.  
**2.** Protocol role-Style or trend setters, leading society at White House
events  
**3.** Good works role-what extra charitable works has she completed?  
**4.** Political role-Does she have political roles? Does she get involved in
policy? Does she have too much power?

_**Wednesday, Apr. 24:**_

Lecture by Prof. Jacqui Banaszynski

**Topic: Racial Profiling**

* When the press identifies race even though it isn't related to a story, it's suggesting something about that race (e.g., African Americans are   
criminals, Muslims are terrorists, Hispanics are poor, etc.).

* When writing a story, a journalist should consider four guidelines regarding race: 

1\. Accuracy: have you identified the person correctly?  
2\. Precision: is your identification accurate enough to serve the purpose  
you're claiming to serve?  
3\. Context: does race fit in the context of the story?  
4\. Relevance:  
-a. Is race relevant to the story?   
-b. Have you explained the relevance?   
-c. Is your story free of codes?   
-d. Are racial identifiers used evenly?   
-e. Should you consult someone of another race/ethnicity? 

It is also important to consider what the public will assume regarding race.
For example, if race is not a factor, but you are sure the public will assume
a subject is black, address that. Otherwise you are inadvertantly perpetuating
the public's stereotypes.

**_Monday, Apr. 29:_**

**Topic: Religion panel**

**Islam** -literally means peace  

Those who practice Islam believe:  
* In the oneness of God - all prophets spread His word  
* In the day of judgment  
* In angels that obey God and can take ones soul  
* In the Old and New Testament but only what is confirmed by the Koran  
* Prayer must involve physical movement  
* That one should only bow to might God, nobody else  
* There is no hierarchy in Islam, only confide in God  
* In charity - 2.5 percent must go to the poor as an act of devotion to God  
* Fasting in the month of Ramadan. One cannot have sex, drink or eat from dawn until sunset  
* That once in a lifetime, believers should visit Mecca if it is safe and one can afford it  
* That Islam is about values - worship people, not values  
* That Islam is the final religion  

**Judaism**  

* Judaism recognizes that there is more than one way to serve God.  
* Two percent of the world's population is Jewish and the Rabbi said he believes that is because Jews don't believe you have to practice Judaism to go to heaven.  
* "Don't do to others (not just other Jews) what you don't want others to do to you," is one of the things Judaism is about.  
* Charity is a fundamental mitzvoth - a prescription indicating what one should and shouldn't do.   
* Judaism doesn't care about whether or not you feel like giving. You have an obligation to give.  
* God does not get involved in confessions. One should confess to the person they mistreated or slandered, not to God. That person must forgive the confessor.  
* The focus is not on life after death but on this life.  
* It's a way of living that focuses on the deed, not the creed.

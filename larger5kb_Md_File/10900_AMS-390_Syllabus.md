**AMERICAN POPULAR CULTURE: THEORY AND METHOD**

**  
**

> **COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

>

>> In this graduate research seminar, we will consider several schools of
thought regarding the study of popular culture. After an initial attempt to
define popular culture, we will assess various (and divergent) scholarly
perspectives that treat popular culture as a form of social control, a site of
class conflict, or as a form of agency. Some of the books are "classics" in
the field, while others represent ways that current scholars use theoretical
material as part of their interdisciplinary American Studies apparatus.
Although the course will give you some sense of how American popular culture
has changed over time, I focus on theory and application, rather than popular
culture as an historical process.

>>

>>  
>

> **COURSE FORMAT:**

>

>> After eleven weeks of reading and discussion, we will adjourn for two weeks
while everyone completes primary source research and writing. After this
break, by WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 29, AT 5:00 PM, each student will give me THREE
copies of h/her paper. I will then place two copies on INFORMAL RESERVE at the
UGL. Everyone will read each other's papers, and will offer written comments
to each other when we reconvene for the last week of the semester. Each
student is expected to produce a publishable paper of twenty to twenty-five
pages in length comprised of primary source materials on some aspect-
historical or contemporary-concerning American popular culture.

>>

>>  
>

> **CLASS FORMAT:**

>

>> I will talk informally for the first few minutes of class, and then, will
turn over the discussion to two students. As discussion leaders, your job is
to 1) briefly summarize the reading 2) give us some background about the
author (i.e. other works, pertinent life experiences) 3) offer a series of
critical questions for the rest of the group 4) present a primary popular
cultural application-this can be contemporary or historical-to the written
texts. You may bring in a magazine, piece of music, a photograph, a video
clip, anything that grounds the theoretical underpinnings of the texts in
actual cultural practice. During the last part of the discussion, this sort of
"show and tell" will help us apply the theories in a practical, useful manner.
Of course, your research papers will be the apotheosis of this exercise! At
various moments of the discussion, I will furnish additional information (if
needed!) and will change the course of discussion (again, if needed).

>>

>>  
>

> **CLASS REQUIREMENTS:**

>

>> You are responsible for completing the reading assignments, participating
in the weekly discussion, leading one of the meetings, writing a five page
reaction paper-due the week (in class) AFTER you have led the discussion, and
you will also write a twenty to twenty-five page research paper on any subject
concerning American popular culture. The research paper will contain primary
and secondary source materials, all of which you will use to support your
general argument. In your paper, be sure to identify your own theoretical
leanings with regard to the material we've covered in class. We will talk
about the paper at length in the next few weeks. I will calculate your final
grade in the following manner: Discussion Leading 10 points; General
Participation 20 points; Reaction Paper 20 points; Final Paper 50 points.

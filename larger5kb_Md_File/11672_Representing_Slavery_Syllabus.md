### Representing Slavery

**  
  
Carl Pedersen (carped@uwyo.edu; 6-3839)  
Office Hours Mon/Weds 10-12 or by appointment  
University of Wyoming  
Spring 2000 **  
  
This course will examine the impact of slavery on American society and
cultural identity. The aim of the course is twofold: to introduce students to
the history of slavery and to look at how historians, writers and filmmakers
in the twentieth century have interpreted the slave past in light of current
concerns. Coursework includes historical accounts, autobiographies, novels,
and films that offer conflicting perspectives on the meaning of slavery in
contemporary American culture. We will also look at relevant web sites.  
  
There will be a mid-term exam on material covered during the first 4 weeks of
the course (the section entitled "Slavery and the American Past"). You will be
expected to choose a research topic for the second half of the course, and
submit a 15-20 page paper. A short prospectus of the paper (including title,
outline, and bibliography) will be due on 29 Feb. The final exam will focus on
material covered in the section "Slavery and the American Present."  
  
Since this is a small seminar, active participation in class discussions is
not only encouraged, but required.  
  
**Required Texts  
** Peter Kolchin,  American Slavery (AS)  
Lawrence Goodheart et al., eds., Slavery in American Society  (SAS)

Course Description:
Throughout the twentieth century, American adults have been frightened 
by the actions of their own young.  From the sexually liberated 
'flappers' of the 1920s to the chronically disaffected 'slackers' of the 
1990s, America has been obsessed with the problem of 'youth 
rebellion.'
This course examines key episodes in the history of twentieth-century 
youth culture and adult reactions to that culture (esp. to the degree 
that youth culture was perceived as dangerous and rebellious). Our 
sources will include historical documents and studies, autobiography, 
fiction, television, music and film.  Beginning with a general 
discussion of what it means to be 'young' in America, we will progress 
to a study of key historical episodes, of 'rebel icons' like James Dean, 
and of how 'adult' responses to youth culture and youth rebellion become 
embodied in social institutions such as the family and the public 
school.

Films
A series of films will be viewed in conjunction with this class. 
Because of scheduling constraints, these films must be viewed outside of 
regular class time. Attendance at class showings of these films is 
strongly recommended, as each film will be prefaced by 
me and briefly discussed by the class immediately after viewing. If you 
absolutely cannot attend a class showing of a film, you should view it 
privately before the next class meeting. All films are available at the 
Media Reserve Desk in the Main Library.

Course Requirements:
In addition to regular class attendance and active 
participation in classroom discussions and activities, you will be 
required to complete a set of assignments based on our study of the 
cultural history of American youth. These assignments and their 
weight in determining your final grade for this course are as follows:
Personal Journal (25%)--you will keep a personal 
journal of your reactions to our readings, lectures, etc. This on-going 
assignment will allow you to react individually to our common experiences 
and to write in a looser style than will be expected in other 
assignments. It will allow your instructor to evaluate each individual's 
level of engagement with our readings and our class. Also, writing in 
your journal will give you a basis for participation in class 
discussions. Journal entries will be collected bi-weekly for review by 
your instructor.
Group Presentation (25%)--everyone will be expected 
to take part in a group presentation project in the latter part of the 
semester. Group members will make a presentation on their topic to the 
class and each member will write a brief (2-3 pp.) paper on the 
presentation topic. Group projects will focus on some aspect of youth 
rebellion in the 1960s (e.g., the Civil Rights Movement, the New Left, 
the Counterculture, the underground press).
Research Paper (30%)--you will be expected to 
complete one longer (10-12 pp.) research paper as your final assignment 
in this class. Papers may address any topic covered in the course, or may 
introduce new topics that can be closely related to ideas, issues, or 
historical themes raised during the semester. Your research will be 
expected to encompass both primary and secondary sources. A paper 
proposal will be collected in class early in the semester.
*Click on the individual assignment 
(above) to jump directly to a separate assignment sheet describing the basic 
requirements for each of these projects.
Time will be set aside in class periodically throughout the semester 
for you to discuss your ongoing work on each of these assignments with 
your classmates and your instructor.
In addition to these assignments, your Class 
Participation will be evaluated by your instructor and will be 
factored into your grade for the course.
Class Participation will be worth the remaining (20%) of your final 
grade.

Attendance Policy:
As noted above, regular attendance is expected in this course. While 
you are not required to attend, and while your instructor 
realizes that circumstances may conspire to thwart your good intentions in 
this regard, one cannot 'make up' missed classroom activities and 
discussions. Attendance will be taken regularly and repeated absences 
will affect your final grade for the course. In addition 
to being reflected in your 'participation' grade, you will not receive a 
grade higher than a 'B' in this course should you miss more than seven 
(7) of our regularly scheduled class meetings (regardless of your grades 
on other assignments).
Due Dates to Remember:

Research paper proposal due (February 4th)
	Target dates for group presentations (March 27th-April 17th)
	Research papers due (May 1st)

All work for this course must be submitted to me by 
May 7th, 1997

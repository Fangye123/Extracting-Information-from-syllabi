**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course explores various anthropological approaches to the study of myth,
folklore, and popular culture. It focuses on the interpretive strategies
anthropologists use to answer the following questions: What do comic books,
folktales, folksongs, proverbs, jokes, myths, movies, toys, dolls, and
television shows mean? What can we learn about a culture from studying its
folklore, myths, and popular culture? The general assumption that will guide
us in our attempts to answer these questions is that all these  "texts" can be
understood as symbolic or expressive forms through which people communicate
important messages about their culture both to themselves and to others as
well. More specifically this course will concentrate on theoretical approaches
such as Marxism, psychoanalysis, structuralism, reader response criticism,
cultural studies, and feminism in order to analyze a variety of material
including Barbie dolls, Grimm's folktales, Disney films, Ibo proverbs, Apache
jokes, ancient Greek myths, modern Greek funeral laments, modern Greek dance,
Native American myths, and Australian Aboriginal rock music. There are links

>   1. Class attendance and participation in class discussion. Regular and
valuable contribution to class discussion will raise a student's grade. Poor
attendance will lower it.  
>  
>

>   2. Mid-term exam (20% of the final grade).  
>  
>

>   3. Term paper involving original analysis of some body of folklore, myth,
or popular culture. See the last page of the syllabus for further information
(40% of the final grade).  
>  
>

>   4. Take-home final exam (40% of the final grade).

> **TERM-PAPER**

>

> The term-paper for this course should be an original analysis of some text
or group of texts that can be considered myth, folklore, or popular culture.
If you have doubts about the appropriateness of your planned topic, please see
me. However, I interpret the terms "myth," "folklore," and "popular culture,"
as well as the term "text" very broadly. The important questions are not "Is
it folklore?" and "Is it a text?," but "Can you analyze it in an interesting
manner?" and "What does it mean?"

>

> In your paper you should make use of one of the theoretical approaches that
we have discussed in class. You need to "get beneath the surface" of the texts
and offer some interpretation of them that is not immediately obvious and that
would not have been available to you without the use of a theoretical
approach. Do not simply summarize the text. Analyze and interpret it. If you
choose a text that is from American culture, you might consider doing
fieldwork and asking people who know or use the text what it means, but
fieldwork is certainly not a requirement. You are also encouraged to consider
texts from other cultures written in other languages.

>

> Your paper should include: an introduction, a brief description of the texts
you will analyze and their ethnographic context, and a clear and explicit
statement of the theoretical perspective you plan to adopt in which you define
clearly the important terms and concepts you use. (The order of these two
parts of your paper may obviously be reversed.) The most important part of
your paper is the actual analysis itself. (Its relative importance should be
reflected in its relative length.) Here you should apply the theory to the
texts in order to offer an interpretation of what the text means.  Think also
about what we can learn from the text about the culture of which they are a
part. What, for example, does Babar tell us about relationships between the
first and the third worlds? What does Sleeping Beauty tell us about the role
of women in American culture? Here you need to do close textual analysis,
focussing on specific words, images, and events.

>

> A possible format for the term paper (which should be about 10-12 pages
long) would look like this:

>

> Introduction |  (1 page)  
> ---|---  
> Ethnographic description - (text & context) | (2 pages)  
> Theoretical orientation | (2 pages)  
> ANALYSIS |  (5 pages)  
> Conclusion | (1 page)  
>  
> Possible topics include: Passamaquoddy folktales, Pueblo origin myths,
Yanomamo love stories, Norse myths, Navaho healing chants, Aesop's fables,
illustrations of native Americans from sixteenth century voyages of discovery,
Franco-American folktales, the tales of Uncle Remus, Harlequin Romances,
Superman comic books, narratives from women's consciousness raising groups or
meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous, Sesame Street, Tales for Liberated Children
from _Ms. Magazine_ , stories from elementary school reading books, Reggae
music, etc.

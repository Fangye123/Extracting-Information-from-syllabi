**Syllabus**  
**Course title** : **A Political Sociology of Human Rights**  
**Catalog description** : The course teaches political and sociological
concepts in relation to human rights. It explores violations of human rights
in the Yugoslav area. It examines relations between power and justice in
deathly political situations. It raises questions regarding violations of
human rights and explores our relations to these violations. Objectives: The
objectives of the course are to teach:  
1\. Socio-political facts regarding human rights and their violations  
2\. Mastery of sociological and political concepts  
3\. Ways to use these concepts in relation to important questions  
4\. Ways to question conventional understandings of human rights  
5\. The meaning and use of the concept sociocide  
6\. Effective ways to talk about human rights and their violations  
7\. Effective ways to write about human rights and their violations  
8\. Theatrical perspectives on violations of human rights and to encourage
systematic involvement in questions regarding human rights and their
violation.

**Approach** : The course starts with the professor telling stories about what
happened in Bosnia and in Kosovo. He then defines political sociology and
moves the students into a discussion of political sociology and
responsibility. It continues with Keith Doubt's Sociology After Bosnia and
Kosovo (in which he gives us the concept sociocide), with Plato's Republic
(Books I and II), and with Hannah Arendt's Eichman in Jerusalem. It is shaped
by the theatrical orientation of the sociological work of Erving Goffman, and
the theatrical orientation of Augusto Boal, along with the literary work of
Franz Kafka and the literary work of Milan Kundera. As the course continues, a
theatrical approach to sociocide becomes the central focus of it. I will
insist that each student learn the basic socio-political facts of violations
of human rights in Bosnia and Kosovo, and learn to apply sociological and
political concepts to what happened there. It both encourages and requires
each student to complete a project demonstrating systematic involvement with
at least three questions that represent major themes in the course.

**Texts** : In addition to Doubt, Plato, Kafka, and Arendt, the primary texts
are selected human rights documents (e.g. United Nations documents), selected
maps of the Yugoslav area, and selected New York Times articles (1987-2000).
In addition to studying the primary texts, each student must become familiar
with at least five of the texts listed below. Opportunities for the student to
become familiar with these texts include conferences with the professor,

COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is the first half of a two-term sequence on the United States in
the 20th century. Each semester can be taken separately and has no
prerequisite. History 368 begins with the changes in American society at the
end of the 19th century as it confronted the issues of industrialization,
immigration, and urbanization. It covers the reform movement we know as the
Progressive period, and examines the impact of World War I. It explores the
developments that occurred in the 1920s and concludes with the stock market
crash of 1929 and the Great Depression that followed. In all areas, it
examines the lives of men and women in addition to political events, as we try
to understand the social history of the time.

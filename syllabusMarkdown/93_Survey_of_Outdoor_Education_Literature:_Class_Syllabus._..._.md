**University Catalog Course Description**  
"An examination of recent research, literature and contemporary writing in
outdoor education.  Course work consists of a series of reading assignments
followed by oral reports and class discussions."

**Course Content**  
This is a course on outdoor literature. Outdoor literature, of course, is a
broad topic and includes several different genres including writings in
outdoor adventure, nature, the environment, and adventure travel writing.  To
keep things manageable, the emphasis of this course is on outdoor adventure
writing:  exploration, survival, sailing, mountaineering, whitewater boating,
kayaking, etc.  But outdoor adventure writing can't be totally divorced from
other related genres. There are a number of key works which--although not
technically outdoor adventure--have had a profound influence in all outdoor
writing.  One prime example is Thoreau's Walden.  Knowingly or unknowingly,
many of the reasons that people offer these days on why they participate in
outdoor adventure activities can be traced to the pages of Walden.  
         In addition to covering important works which had an influence on outdoor adventure writing, it is also the purpose of this course to provide some sense of history.  Outdoor adventure activities such as mountaineering and river running have a rich history populated with fascinating men and women, and filled with triumphs and failures, and real-life mysteries.  A great amount of satisfaction is derived from knowing something about the people and events which shaped outdoor activities.  Mountaineering, for instance, is much more alive and you have a greater appreciation for the sport when you understand the struggles that climbers went through in the past.   
           Thus this class encompasses outdoor adventure, its history and the writings which influence outdoor adventure.   To provide variety, readings will be selected from a range of different outdoor activities.  Some of those activities include survival, mountaineering, horseback riding, river running, arctic exploration, sailing, canoeing, kayaking, desert hiking, and backpacking.

**Course Requirements & Assessments**  
This is a reading course, and the best way to do well in the class is to keep
up with the regularly assigned readings.  By keeping up with the readings,
you'll be able to fully participate in classroom discussions which are a key
part of the learning experience.  
       Assessment of your progress in the class is done through written tests.  Most classes will have a short quiz on that day's reading material.  Additionally, one mid term and one final exam will be given which cover readings, lectures and classroom discussions. 

**Class Schedule**  
The class is scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  Since a
two-credit class normally meets two hours a week, this provides for
flexibility in the schedule and allows for some off-days.   The off-days will
be scheduled during times of particularly heavy reading loads.  The hope is to
provide you with adequate study time to digest the material and keep up with
out-of-class assignments.  The instructor will keep you appraised since the
schedule will vary depending on class progress.

**Attendance Policy**  
According to Physical Education Departmental policy, students must attend at
least 75% of a class in order to receive a passing grade.  Since frequent
quizzes will be given and major tests will cover material discussed in class,
it is to your advantage to make a concerted effort to attend all classes.  


**Evaluation Criteria and Grading Scale** ****

Quizzes, mid term and final exam are each 1/3 of the total grade.

Idaho State University standard four-point grading scale is utilized:

A 4.0 Excellent Performance  
A- 3.70 Excellent Performance  
B+ 3.30 Good Performance  
B 3.00 Good Performance  
B- 2.70 Good Performance  
C+ 2.30 Adequate Performance  
C 2.00 Adequate Performance  
C- 1.70 Adequate Performance  
D+ 1.30 Marginal Performance  
D 1.00 Marginal Performance  
D- .70 Marginal Performance  
F 0.0 Unacceptable Performance  


**Reasonable Accommodation for Students with Disabilities**  
If you have a diagnosed disability or believe that you might require
"reasonable accommodation" on the part of the instructor, please call the
Director, Center of Services for Students with Disabilities at 282-3599.  As a
part of the Americans with Disabilities Act, it is the responsibility of the
student to disclose a disability prior to requesting reasonable
accommodations.

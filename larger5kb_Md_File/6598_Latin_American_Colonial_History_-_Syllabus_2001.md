This course surveys the history of the vast region now known as Latin America,
from the Spanish and Portuguese invasions beginning in 1492 to the early
nineteenth-century wars of independence. We focus on the indigenous roots and
realities of Latin America; on the social, economic, and political expansion
of Europe (Spain and Portugal) into the Americas; on the disruptions,
realignments, and continuities in the major indigenous civilizations of the
Americas (Aztec, Maya, Inca) in the course of three centuries of colonization;
and on the creation of peculiarly American societies, including African-
American, mestizo, and Euro-American settler communities, in the Spanish and
Portuguese colonial empires.

We will cover the following themes and topics in colonial history: the main
social groups of early Latin America; the shifting uses and definitions of
class, ethnicity (or "race"), and gender in the colonial context; religion and
religious transformations in the colonial Americas; the people, the law, and
concepts of justice; the origin and development of the principal social and
economic institutions of the region.

**Discussion section.** In addition to the lectures, there will be a weekly
discussion section taught by Juan Hern¨¢ndez, a doctoral student in Latin
American history. Students may elect either an English-language or a Spanish-
language discussion session. Those electing the Spanish-language section,
which involves extra work, will also enroll in UC 390.001 for an additional 1
credit hour.

**Glossaries.** The books _Colonial Lives_ and _Colonial Habits_ each have
extensive glossaries (just before the bibliographies) to define key terms in
colonial history and other words that come up in the reading. If you don't
know the meaning of a word in _italics_ , chances are you will find it in the
glossary!

**Reading, Writing, and Grading.**

Lectures and discussions are participatory and refer frequently to examples
taken from the reading. **Readings are to be finished before class.** If you
do not do the readings you will find it difficult or impossible to follow
lectures and discussions. You may do additional reading for your papers.
Course grades will be based on participation in class and discussion section,
two short papers, and two exams.

**1) Participation.** You are expected to attend both lectures and discussion
sessions regularly. You will receive a grade for the discussion section. (20%
of final grade.)

**2) Writing.** During the course you will write **two short essays** **(5 to
6 pages each)** on topics outlined in the course schedule, below. These are
due September 27 and November 15. Paper topics will be announced in class.
(15% each = 30% of final grade.)

**Technical guidelines for papers:**

Use 12-point or 11-point "Times New Roman." Use standard margins (1-inch
margins at top and bottom, 1 to 1.25 inches on the sides.) Indent the first
lines of paragraphs.  
**All quotes and paraphrases must be attributed; quotes go in "quotation
marks."**  
You may use either footnotes (history style) or social-science style
attributions; just be consistent.  
Extended quotes (more than five lines) are indented rather than set in
quotation marks (look at any book to see how).  
**Double-space** your text, but **single-space** footnotes (if any),
bibliography (if any), and extended quotes.  
Number your pages, and put your name on your paper!  
A 5- to 6-page paper is 1500 words (in Word, click on "Tools" and then "Word
Count" to find out how long your essay is).

**3) Exams.** There will be an in-class midterm on October 17 and a take-home
final, distributed on December 5 and due December 12. (25% each = 50% of final
grade)

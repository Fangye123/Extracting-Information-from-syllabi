**March 6**

Sections from Ovid, _Metamorphoses_. Some of these stories extend over more
than one Web page; I have noted by each item how many screens you will have to
read.

Book 1 [ (Daphne](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+1.452&vers=english;more) (2); [
Io](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+1.567&vers=english;more&browse=1) (3 + top of a
fourth page; this story continues directly from Daphne's));  
Book 4 [ (Salmacis and Hermaphroditus](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+4.271&vers=english;more)\--1 + half of a second
page);  
Book 6 [ (Procne and Philomela](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+6.412&vers=english;more) (3)), and  
Book 10 [ (Pygmalion](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+10.243&vers=english;more) (1), [
Myrrha](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=ov.+met.+10.298&vers=english;more)\--1; this follows directly
after Pygmalion)

Questions for study and discussion:

  * Daphne and Philomela are both pursued amorously by men who desire them. How do the two females differ from one another? 
  * In the story of Procne, Philomela, and Tereus: Consider the elements of human culture and society to which this story refers--family, marriage rites, funeral rites, meals. In addition to the rape itself, why are Tereus' actions so problematic? What about Procne's actions at various points in the story? 
  * How much attention does Ovid give to Tereus' rape of Philomela? How much to his mutilation of her? 
  * Do you have any thoughts on Ovid's motivations in his portrayal of the scene? 
  * In this light, what are your thoughts of how sex and sexuality are portrayed here? What about violence, and its relationship to sex? 
  * Consider Philomela's different modes of speech. How would you compare her speech--or substitute for speech--to Lucretia's storytelling in Livy's history? 
  * Now consider women's voices in Io's and Myrrha's stories. What do they have in common with the story of Philomela? 
  * Can you make any larger observations, from these few stories, on Roman attitudes toward women's speech/voices? 
  * What do you make of Pygmalion's obsession with his statue? 
  * In the Salmacis and Hermaphroditus episode, what sorts of images and metaphors are associated with each of the two characters? What can you extrapolate from the distribution of characteristics? 
  * What does the Salmacis/Hermaphroditus story imply for the male view of female sexuality? 
  * What possibilities does it raise for our view of gender? 
  * How is Hermaphroditus' body represented, after the merging? 
  * How does Ovid represent women's bodies in all these stories, before and after transformation? What relationship do the various women of his stories have to the human (or, in the case of Daphne, quasi-human) culture from which they originate?

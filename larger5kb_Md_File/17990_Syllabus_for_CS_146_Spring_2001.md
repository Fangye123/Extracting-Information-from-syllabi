Prerequisites: [CS 141 (Computing
Hardware)](http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~cs141) or equivalent.

_Brief abstract:_

A study of the fundamental concepts in the design and organization of modern
computer systems. Topics include computer organization, instruction set
design, processor design, memory system design, timing issues, interrupts,
microcoding, and various performance-enhancing parallel techniques such as
pipelining. Study of existing architectures using CISC, RISC, vector, data
parallel, and VLIW designs. An extensive lab project will be required of all
students.

Half course. Exam Group: 16, 17, 18.

_Overview:_

Computer Science 146 is a comprehensive course in the architecture and
organization of modern computers. Students are already expected to be
comfortable with designing, coding, and debugging programs of modest
complexity while employing good programming style, structured techniques, and
employing appropriate data structures as appropriate. In addition, some
experience with digital logic and gates and with programming in assembler
language is presumed.

A significant portion of the class will be the design and implementation of a
major term project. The project will be developed by students working together
in groups of two. That project is the core of a new computer's central
processing unit including the data path, instruction fetch and decoding unit,
and registers. The project will interface to laboratory equipment that will
function as the main memory (RAM) and I/O device. Initially the classroom
lectures will be covering material important to the design and implementation
of a final project. Later the laboratory portion of the class and the
classroom portion will diverge. In class, we will cover advanced architecture
techniques. In lab, students will continue working on and debugging their
projects leading to their complete implementation and demonstration.

Because the course requires a significant term project involving both
programming and hardware implementation, the assignments will be time-
consuming; therefore, a significant time commitment to the course is
necessary. Although the relevant experience of students in the class is
usually quite diverse, depending on background, it is not unusual for students
to spend 15-20 hours per week or more completing the readings and homework
assignments. Although the computers are available more-or-less around the
clock and the hardware lab should be available until midnight, occasionally
they will suddenly become unavailable (this is know as a _crash_ ). As with
all such events, they always seem to occur at the worst possible time. Plan
your computer work so that it is complete in advance of the deadlines. **You
have now been forewarned!**

_Teaching Assistants:_

Each student is assigned to a Teaching Assistant (TA). Each TA holds weekly
sections and office hours as described below. Attendance at your TA's section
is strongly recommended. Your TA should be your primary point of contact for
questions and issues.

_Grading:_

  * 35% Programming assignments & problem sets 
  * 15% Midterm exam (open book) 
  * 50% Term project (required) 

All problem sets and programming assignments are due _at the beginning of
class_. Unless otherwise stated, all programming assignment solutions must be
written in C, C++, or Java, have run on ice[*].fas.harvard.edu, be submitted
using the "submit" program or via e-mail, be well-written (clear coding style,
modular structure, appropriately commented and documented), and tested. The
grade for programming assignments will include all of these attributes. (Of
course, the solutions may be written and tested using any system of the
student's choosing; however, when the solution is complete, it must be moved
to the course computers and tested there!) The Science Center computers may be
accessed using "telnet" or "rlogin" over the Internet. Files may be
transferred to these systems using "ftp". In addition to handing in all parts
of the problem set solution or programming assignment program, sample runs of
the program which demonstrate that the program works must be attached. A
transcript of running the program with sample data can be created by using the
"script" program on the Science Center computers. A late homework will lose 5%
of its original grade for each day it is late (e.g. an assignment handed in
two and a half days late will receive its original grade multiplied by 0.85).
Late assignments may be submitted via the "submit" program or e-mailed to your
teaching assistant. In addition, each student is given five free late days
that may be used freely during the semester. However, keep in mind that the
assignments are often built on the previous assignments; handing in one
assignments late does not extend the due date for subsequent assignments.

_Plagiarizing:_

All work should be the personal creation of the individual student. Students
are free to consult with each other, to study together, etc., but all problem
set solutions, programming assignments, and exams must be the personal
contribution of that student. If a paper, assignment, or exam contains
information taken from another source, that source and material must be
explicitly identified and credit given.

**Course Description**

An introduction to the study of Western rhetorical theory from Classical times
to the early Renaissance, English 779.01 offers students an opportunity to
study rhetorical theory, practice, and pedagogy in the context of Western
cultural and intellectual history. Further, it provides a foundation in
rhetorical theory for students engaged in graduate study of composition,
literature, and criticism. Rather than attempting a comprehensive survey in
ten weeks, English 779.01 will focus on key texts and contexts, critical
problems, and research tools. In general, our objective will be to develop
critical and historical perspectives, interpretive strategies, and research
skills that can form the foundation of further study in rhetoric.

As one of my colleagues at another university puts it on his syllabus, "we
will study the rhetoric of traditions as well as The Rhetorical Tradition,"
noting how historical accounts of rhetoric are themselves rhetorical-i.e.,
value-laden, persuasive, and historically situated in the cultural, social,
and political matrices of particular communities.

**Specific Course Objectives**

  * to read and analyze selected rhetorical theories from antiquity through the early Renaissance; 
  * to relate those rhetorical theories to their intellectual and social contexts--especially to rhetorical practices in those contexts; 
  * to examine key theoretical issues that have shaped the development of rhetorical theories and practices in the West and that inform recent histories of rhetoric; 
  * to become familiar with the forums, critical perspectives, and research tools that inform contemporary studies of rhetoric; 
  * to begin to construct your own theories and histories of rhetoric. 

**Course Requirements**

  * write two one-page (single-spaced) **reading** **responses** to primary readings of your choosing, and post these to the class, via e-mail or mailboxes, prior to class (15%); 
  * compile an **annotated bibliography** of six to eight books, articles, and/or other scholarly resources (print or electronic) related to an author, text, or topic of your choice (15%); 
  * write a two- to three-page **explanatory annotation** to a key passage/phrase/idea of your choosing in one of our primary readings, connecting the passage/phrase/idea to its intellectual or social context and, optionally, assessing its relevance to present-day intellectual and/or social issues (20%); 
  * write an eight- to ten-page **research proposal** on a topic of your choice--presumably the same topic on which you focused your bibliography and explanatory annotation (35%) 
  * participate in class discussion and take a collaboratively designed **final exam** (15%)

The primary readings outlined below will, I trust, prove challenging,
rewarding, and manageable, allowing you time to pursue additional reading of
secondary literature (more on that reading later). Please keep in mind that
details of the schedule may change once the course gets underway, and note
that the dates for readings are dates for _discussion._ See the class web site
under "[Reading Rhetorical Theory](Reading_Theory.htm) " and "[Ariadne's
Threads-Lines of Inquiry](Ariadne's_Threads.htm)" for suggestions about how to
prepare for class discussions.

**Assignments**

In keeping with the purpose of this course--to introduce students to graduate
study in rhetoric--I've constructed assignments that involve the basic
practices of scholarship in this field: reading primary texts critically,
constructing and testing interpretations in discussion with colleagues,
reading texts in(to) their intellectual and social contexts, and identifying
significant scholarly problems/discussions and means of inquiring into those
problems. In the spirit of collaborative inquiry, all of your work will be
shared with other members of the class, either in print or electronically (via
e-mail or the World Wide Web). I will discuss the format and goals of these
assignments further in class, but please don't hesitate to ask if you have any
questions about them at any time.

**Reading responses (2).** Your one-page reading responses must be posted to
the class e-mail reflector or placed in mailboxes at least two days before the
class meeting on which we are scheduled to discuss the text to which you are
responding (we will schedule the responses in class). The specific topic of
these responses is up to you, but I ask that you develop your response
according to one of the following approaches:

  * a reflective commentary on some interpretive problem you faced while reading a passage in one of our texts and the **reading strategies** that you used to interpret that text; 
  * a nomination for the **most significant** or the **most problematic** passage in an assigned reading, including a rationale for your nomination; 
  * a **comparative reading** of two passages that raise some interpretive issue that you would like the class to consider; 
  * an **application** of a rhetorical concept articulated in one of our texts to some current issue (such as hate speech) or communicative context (such as the college classroom). 

Though you might consult outside sources in the course of writing your
response, such research is not necessary; the point of these responses is to
focus and direct our initial responses to a text. Please follow MLA
conventions for providing page references for all quotations and a list of all
works cited, including our course texts.

**Annotated Bibliography.** I will provide you with some bibliographical
"starting places" for locating scholarship on your chosen topic. Your job will
be to assemble an annotated bibliography of eight to ten citations in MLA
format. The abstract accompanying each citation should be approximately 50-75
words long and should identify the problem addressed by the article, the
author's method of inquiry, and the author's findings. I have in mind, then,
largely descriptive abstracts.

**Explanatory annotation.** By contrast, your two- to three-page (single-
spaced) explanatory annotation should reach beyond the text of one of our
primary works, weaving it into its intellectual and/or social context and,
optionally, assessing its relevance to contemporary rhetorical
theory/practice/culture. The basic question I ask you to address is "What does
one need to know about the cultural context of this work to understand its
relation to that context?" To do this assignment, then, you will need to do
some contextual research and reading. As with the reading responses, please
follow MLA conventions for providing page references and a list of all works
cited, including our course texts.

**Research Proposal.** Building on the research you undertook for your
annotated bibliography (and, perhaps, for your explanatory annotation) this
ten- to twelve-page research proposal should _pose_ a significant problem or
question in rhetorical theory, practice, and/or culture in the context of
other scholarly work and your own review of primary materials, then _propose_
a line of inquiry into the problem/question. What evidence do you need to
consider? Where can you find it? How would you analyze that evidence? What do
you hope such a study would contribute to the study of rhetoric? The topic and
method of inquiry you pursue are up to you, but they should engage in, respond
to, disrupt, challenge, extend, or otherwise clearly relate to a critical
conversation that you discover--and document--in the secondary literature.

**Participation and Exam.** This class is designed around collaborative
problem posing and inquiry-it will not succeed unless everyone comes to class
prepared for active participation. The most important element of that
preparation will be your careful reading of our primary texts (see the
following pages for suggestions), but I also expect that you will take
advantage of secondary work (some relevant scholarship is on reserve in the
library and listed in a bibliography I will give you at the beginning of
class). The final exam is meant to provide some tentative closure to our class
discussions, so we will compose the prompt(s) or question(s) together. You
will write the exam individually.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

In this course we will examine the major political systems of Western Europe,
focusing our attention on their evolution since the end of the Second World
War in 1945. We will begin by broadly tracing the evolution of recent European
history, placing current politics into their larger historical context.
Political science approaches to analyzing political and governmental systems
will be reviewed. Following this foundation, the bulk of the course will
examine historical and modern politics and government in five European
nations: the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands.
Particular attention will be paid to Italy, as a case study for examining the
issues of democracy, the Cold War, political culture, and the challenges of
European integration.

The course will conclude with a detailed analysis of an issue that will be
discussed throughout the semester \- efforts to build a European Union. This
represents one of two contrasting themes of the politics of Western Europe
since 1945: efforts at European integration, frequently in conflict with
national political cultures and institutional forces. Course lectures and
discussions will draw on current events, so reading news sources like _The New
York Times_ or _The Economist_ is encouraged.

Class participation is expected and encouraged. My hope is that this class
will not only teach you about Western Europe, but also give you a better
perspective on our own political system. Don't hesitate to ask questions if
something is unclear.

In Class Exam - October 13             30% of grade  
Research Paper                         30% of grade  
    -1st Outline Due October 25

The in class and final exams will be essay style, supplemented by short answer
questions and identifications.

The topic of the research paper is open. YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE YOUR TOPIC
APPROVED BY THE INSTRUCTOR, and are encouraged to consult on outlines and
submit rough drafts for review. The paper should be at least 15 pages in
length, and should demonstrate substantial library research. It should be
constructed around a hypothesis and a supporting argument with evidence; it is
not enough to write a simple descriptive treatment. An example of such a
hypothesis would be the following: "The inability of Italy to achieve a stable
party government is due to its political culture of autonomous regions". Your
paper would focus on trying to prove this claim by mounting arguments and
evidence. YOU WILL WRITE THE BEST PAPER BY STARTING EARLY.

You will also be expected to give an 8-10 minute presentation on the major
argument of your paper. The presentation will be graded on content,
organization and clarity.

LATE WORK WILL BE PENALIZED unless due to UNAVOIDABLE emergencies, in the
judgment of the instructor. Attendance and reading of assigned materials is
expected.

Students who need course adaptations or accommodations because of documented
disability, or who have emergency medical needs, or who need special
arrangements in case the building must be evacuated should see me as soon as
possible.

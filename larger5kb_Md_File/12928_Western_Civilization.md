the history of the western world from ancient times to 1648.  The course will

development of "western" civilization.

**Section I: The Ancient World to Roman Times**

 In this section, we will examine the development of western civilization's
social, intellectual, religious, and political institutions as men and women
move from hunter gather society into cities and "civilizations".  We will
focus on how humans organize themselves into different types of societal and
political units as well as exploring the human ability to think about
themselves in relation to a God or Gods and to their fellow humans.

**Keep in mind the following themes:**

The distribution of labor and power in hunter gather society and how it
changes as humans move into cities.

The importance and different roles of religion in Egyptian, Mesopotamian,
Hebrew, Greek, and Roman society.

The differences and similarities in the evolution of political and social
orders of settled human societies.

The building blocks of western civilization: law, government, religion, art,
science, philosophy, literature, warfare, and social relationships.

How humans relate to divinity, humanity, and nature.

How humans mobilize resources and create technology

The evolution of social structure such as class, gender, slavery and
citizenship

The impact of other civilizations and cultures on "the west"

The creation, maintenance, and fall of empires.

**ESSAY QUESTIONS**  
 The essay is due Wednesday, September 19.  All papers must be 4-5 pages,
double-spaced, typed, and proofread.  
1) Read closely: Lysistrata and  Discovering the Western Past, Chapter 2.  
 Aristophanes' Lysistrata focuses upon women as the main characters.  In
addition, chapter 2 of Discovering the Western Past in your textbook discusses
the role of women in Athenian society.  What do the play and the documents
tell us about the role and place of women and men in Greek society.  What are
the social, political, and intellectual conditions of Greek women and men?
What do these sources tell us about the relationship between men and women in
Greek society?  Can you draw other conclusions from this reading or draw upon
other readings to gain an insight into Greek society?

2)  Read closely: : Lysistrata and  Discovering the Western Past , Chapter 2.  
 Chapter 2 of Discovering the Western Past discusses the ideals of Athenian
society.   But Athenian society didn't always live up to these ideals.
Explain what Athenian values and morals were and whether the characters in
Lysistrata and/or individual Athenians succeeded or failed in attaining these
goals.   What is the reality?

**HISTORY OF THE FUTURE**  
**  311-27200-01,02**

**Introduction:**  
We have entered the new millennium.  Now is the time to reflect upon and
analyze the past and present to anticipate, comprehend,  and visualize the
future.  History of the Future is an interdisciplinary evaluation of
historical perceptions and visions of the future.  We shall assess varied
global cultures, institutions and scientific principles in their search,
analysis and historical plans for the future.  We shall also build upon the
varied values and beliefs of futurist visionaries expressed in works of
literature, art and mass media to develop personal visions of the future which
reflect our own evolving identities and values.  The course carefully
evaluates the following interdisciplinary themes:  1.) historical perceptions
and experiments in utopian and futuristic thought and society and changing
concepts of time; 2.) the world-system and the role of industry, science and
technology on future political and economic developments; 3.) war, peace and
destruction: perceptions and apocalyptic visions of World War III and the
unraveling of civilization; 4.) the physical and human environment: the future
of ecological awareness and gender relations; 5.) a synthesis of earlier
themes in the evaluation and application of three paradigms: a capitalist
world economy, an alternative (socialist) world-system and a decentralized,
antiproductivist set of communities as found in Warren Wagar's A Short History
of the Future; 6.) the utilization of historical reflection and analysis in
the creation of a systemic, global and personal vision and plan for the
future.

**Requirements**

1.   Regular attendance is expected of all students. College policy allows only three unexcused absences. Absences will adversely affect the comprehension of course material and one's  grade. Students are expected to have read the assigned readings and participate in class discussion. 

2.   Book critique and semester project. 

A.  Students must complete one intensive evaluative book critique of either
the Vonnegut, Frank or Callenbach book. The assignment of a specific book will
be equally divided among students at the beginning of the semester. Due dates
are listed in the Topics and Assignment section of the syllabus. The critique
follows a four section format.

1\. Introduction: Introduce the author's main thesis and themes. Include a
brief summary of the critique's contents.

2\. Provide a historical framework based upon other assigned  readings and
class lecture/discussion.

3.  Select and evaluate three themes you consider most significant and support them with specific examples. 

4\. Provide a critique of the work's strong and weak   historical and
stylistic points.  Decide how the book and film relate to the History of the
Future course and recommend an appropriate readership.

     One mastery revision will be allowed. 

B.  Semester project.  Cooperative groups will form based upon the varied
reading assignments and topics under study.  Each group (of three or four)
will further research and develop a specific futurist topic or theme and
present it to fellow classmates towards the end of the semester.  Possible
topics include utopianism, millennium studies, robotics, economic and social
transitions,  apocalyptic visions of war, health, the veneration of science,
genetics, biotechnology, cybernetics, authoritarianism, space travel;
Callenbach: environment, gender relations, culture, and other themes.
Carefully  review listed internet sites for ideas and sources.

4.   A foundations examination will be given week six of the semester. 

5.   Each student will complete an interpretive final essay examination.  The essays will be conceptual in nature and will     test student comprehension and analysis of material covered in class and the readings with special emphasis placed on Wagar's A Short History of the Future. 

6.  A journal of readings. Students are to complete one page conceptual evaluations of two nineteenth century and four twentieth century readings from The Utopia Reader, the "Feminist Utopia" handout.

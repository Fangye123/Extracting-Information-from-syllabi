**Major Advisers.** L. Barber, C.L. Brantley, S. Deyle, D. Harkness, K. Kim,

industrial Europe. History and Philosophy of Science 130B, 150, and 180
fulfill upper division requirements in either the U.S. or Modern Europe field.

Students can create a field in the History of Science upon consultation with a
faculty adviser. They may draw upon the relevant History courses (History 85,
86, 135A, 135B, 185A, and 185B) as well as History and Philosphy of Science
offerings to do so.

Consult the History and Philosophy of Science program for a more detailed
description of course offerings this area and the minor in History and
Philosophy of Science.

###  **Minor Program Requirements:**

The minor in History consists of five upper division courses chosen so that at
least three courses are in one field and at least one course is in another
field. The two fields shall be chosen from among those defined in the catalog
for the major. However, students may also, in consultation with and with the
authorization of a faculty adviser, define other thematic fields.  | |  UNITS  
---|---|---  
**History**| |  **20**  
At least 20 units of upper division history courses| 20  
Examples of minor with thematic emphasis: Pre-Law (British and American
Political and Constitutional Development); The Twentieth Century; The History

* * *

**Minor Advisers.** Same as major advisers.

**Honors and Honors Program.** A student becomes eligible for graduation with
honors by meeting the minimum GPA (usually 3.5) and course requirements
established by the College of Letters and Science. To qualify for History
honors, high or highest honors, students must also complete the History
Department honors program with a GPA of 3.5 or above and write a thesis that
meets the criteria for honors, high honors or highest honors. Students apply
to participate in the department honors program during the latter part of
their junior year. Admission to the program is based on GPA, interviews, and
faculty recommendations. Students admitted to the program must complete the
History 104A, 104B, 104C sequence of honors courses, which demands the
completion of a senior honors thesis. Students who anticipate seeking
admission to the honors program are urged to complete at least one History 102
(undergraduate seminar) before the end of their junior year. When applying for
admission to the honors program, a student should indicate the research
project he or she intends to pursue and should consult with a faculty member
about the project. Students may follow either Plan I or Plan II described
above, and may substitute History 104 in their program (though they may not
substitute it for History 102).

Students who anticipate pursuing graduate work in history or a teaching
credential, and who do not wish to opt for the research emphasis embodied in
the honors program, are encouraged to select Plan II of the major.

**Study Abroad and the History Major.** The department strongly encourages
interested students to pursue their studies abroad. While there are no
specific required courses or prerequisites, students are urged to take at
least one history course that touches upon the geographic area where they plan
to study abroad before departing. To receive a history degree from UC Davis,
students must complete at least 18 upper division units in the history major
at UC Davis (which can include History 101, 102, 103). The remaining major
requirements can be fulfilled abroad provided that _(a)_ the course should be
evaluated as at least four UC Davis units by the Office of the Registrar,
_(b)_ the course should be considered upper division by the standards set
forth by the Education Abroad Program, _(c)_ the student presents copies of
the course work, syllabus, and writing assignments to the department's liaison
person with the EAP office for approval. Note: students who wish to receive
credit for courses taken abroad under programs other than EAP may petition the
Undergraduate Program Committee to do so.

**Teaching Credential Subject Representative.** See also the section on the
Teacher Education Program.

**Waiver Program for Single-Subject Teaching Credential in History.** The
Department of History offers a program of study for students seeking a
secondary teaching credential in history. The program can be accommodated
within the requirements for the major in History, but does require some
specific course work. A list of current course requirements is available in
the Advising Office, Division of Education, 174 Kerr Hall.

**Graduate Study.** The Department of History offers programs of study and
research leading to the M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in history. Detailed
information may be obtained by writing to the Graduate Adviser, Department of
History.

**Graduate Advisers.** A.J. Bauer, B. Bossler, J. Cadden, W. Hagen, K.
Halttunen, A. Taylor, C.E. Walker.

**American History and Institutions.** This University requirement can be
satisfied by passing any one of the following courses in History: 17A, 17B,
72A, 72B, 170A, 170B, 170C, 171A, 171B, 174A, 174B, 174C, 175A, 175B, 175C,
176A, 176B, 177A, 177B, 180A, 180B, 183A, 183B. The upper division courses may
be used only with the consent of the instructor. (See also under University

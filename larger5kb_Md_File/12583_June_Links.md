Biology on the Net**

    

Here are various modules for biology students presented in Online Exhibits,
Fundamental Concepts in Science, Links of Interest, and monthly articles in
"Biology Bytes" webzine. The Exhibits focus on Australian flora and fauna and
include a cool introduction to the break up of Gondwanaland as relates to its
effect on Australian species. Fundamental science tutorials include Energy
Cycles, Trophic Levels, Population Structure and Interactions, Basic Chemstry,
Basic Geology, and Basic Statistics. This is a toolbox for biologists-to-be
and a typically well-done Australian environmentally educational site by Rob
Browne, Macquarie University, New South Wales, Australia.(****) _LF_

**[June 29, 1998](http://www.xs4all.nl/~knehnav/wereldbol/wereldbol.htm)\- De
Wereldbol**

    

While all the rage in Florida now is the _Amorphophallus_ blooming in
Fairchild Tropical Garden, the catalog of De Wereldbol features images of more
than several species of these weird aroids which are grown as nursery stock
and are available for sale. This is a good site for viewing unusual bulbous or
tuberous plants,    likely to contain something extraordinary for even the
most well-traveled of botanists. It is also an excellent link for a survey of
monocots or liliaceous plants. Site by De Wereldbol, Holland.(****) _LF_

1996-1997 New England Apple Pest Management Guide**

    

Anyone with an apple tree will want this guide handy, an extension publication
by six New England universities aimed at providing information to apple
growers via the internet. IPM is the "guiding philosophy" of the manual, whose
section editors are specialists in Entomology, Horticulture, Pesticide Labels,
Pesticide Safety, Plant Pathology, and Weed Science. Methods for insect and
animal pest control are described, followed by a number of tidbits on
pesticide handling, and information on growth regulators and post-harvest
treatments. With all the chemical processes it takes to raise a store-bought
apple with IPM, genetic implants sound better every day! Site edited by Glen
W. Koehler, Associate Scientist IPM/NAPIAP, Pest Management Office, Orono,
Maine. (****) _LF_

**[June 25, 1998](http://www.forestry.umt.edu/bemrp/bemrp-10.htm)\- Bitterroot
Ecosystem/Management Project **

    

Collaborative research by scientists from the USDA Forest Service Rocky
Mountain Research Station, The University of Montana School of Forestry, and
managers from the Bitterroot National Forest and the Northern Region is taking
place to aid preservation of  the complex alpine ecosystems of western Montana
and eastern Idaho. Four Research Areas  focus upon Human Issues, Vegetation,
Fauna, and Landscape Analysis for the region; each provides some degree of
information on what has been learned thus far. Of particular interest is the
Vegetation Group's presentation of Lick Creek area fire history from 1909
onwards and the "Landscape Simulation of Succession under Alternative
Management Scenarios" by Bob Keane and Steve Arno. Discover the important role
of botanists in fire ecology at this site by the Bitterroot Ecosystem
Management/Research Project, Missoula, Montana.(****) _LF_

**[June 24, 1998](http://ificinfo.health.org/index14.htm)\- Food
Biotechnology**

    

Published in September 1994, this introduction to the role of biotechnology in
future world food and crop production explains the benefits of genetic
implantations for accelerating goals in plant breeding. Now men, and not the
birds and the bees, control "the roll of the dice" in selectivity, informed
and knowledgeable as men have never been in their age-old applications of
biotechnology to crops and foods. Enhanced flavor and nutritional quality,
pest, metals, and salt resistance, heat and cold tolerance, and increased
yield are taking place through better genetic tools. Read about these and
advances like bananas fused with hepatitis vaccine at this site by the
International Food Information Council, Washington, D.C. (****) _LF_

**[June 23, 1998](http://www.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/brock/)\- Biology
of Microorganisms**

    

Prentice Hall's companion websites for several biology textbooks include this
supplement to the text _Biology of Microorganisms,_ eighth edition, by
Madigan, Martinko, and  
Parker, Iowa State University. Intended to introduce the science of
microbiology, for each chapter in the text are a set of notes, keywords and
phrases, discussion questions, relevant web destinations and a multiple-choice
self-quiz.  Useful for brushing up on micro, or for general study and review,
professors and students will not want to miss this site by Prentice Hall,

**[June 22, 1998-](http://www.rain-tree.com/index.html)Welcome to the Wealth
of the Rainforest**

    

The Raintree Group companies are concerned with developing sustainable markets
for rain forests products as an alternative to destructive forms of
agriculture; to promote medicinal herbs and specialty food products their
website offers rain forest educational resources for scientists and citizens.
A new search engine has been installed for the Tropical Plant Database which
houses hundreds of informational pages and articles on medicinal plants of the
Amazon. Plants are also accessible by Common and Botanical Name,  by
Disorder/Action, by Plant Properties and Actions, and by Recorded
Ethnobotanical Uses. Data files on individual plants   provide images, a list
of common names, medicinal activity, and clinical references. Discover more
sustainable products of the Amazon, articles, abstracts, and herbal medicine
links at this site by the Raintree Group, Austin, Texas.(****) _LF_

**[June 19, 1998](http://www.caribbeangardens.com/main.htm)\- Caribbean
Gardens**

    

It was 1904 when botanist Dr. Henry Nehrling announced "it is high time to
protect and preserve what is still left (in Florida),"  and his own plant
collection established in southwest Florida in 1919 survives today as
Caribbean Gardens in Naples. The history of the garden is the outstanding
feature of the website. Since Nehrling's days the collection has been managed
by entrepeneur Jules Fleischmann, of the yeast Fleischmanns, then by "Jungle
Larry" and his wife Jane Tetzlaff, midwestern zookeepers (animal collectors)
and conservation advocates who finally moved their exhibit to Caribbean
Gardens. Excellent slide shows offer opportunity to see the rare Florida
Panther and various tropical plant specimens at this site by Cyber Island and
Caribbean Gardens (design and programming by Cyber Island), Naples, Florida.

**[June 18, 1998](http://www.botany.uwc.ac.za/Sci_Ed/index.htm)\- UWC Internet
Bio-Ed Project**

    

Perhaps from a natural inclination to sort and categorize, botanists 'round
the world are  emerging as conspicuous internet facilitators, with cool
displays such as the Department at the University of the Western Cape has put
together for biology education. There are resources for both teachers and
students- in particular the "Standard 8 Syllabus" has tutorials on Ecology,
Cells and Cell Division, Plant Tissues, Animal Tissues, Angiosperm Anatomy,
and Human Anatomy and Physiology. A visit to the Department's corner of the
site turns up the online course "Marine Botany" covering The Physical
Environment, Rocky Shores, Mangrove Forests and Seagrass Beds, Coral Reefs,
Kelp Beds, Biodiversity, Management and  
Conservation. Don't miss the splendid "Introduction to Nongeniculate Coralline
Algae" at this site by authors Derek Keats and Roy Volkwyn; maintained by
Jocelyn Collins, Botany Department, University of the Western Cape, Cape Town,
South Africa.(****) _LF_

**[June 17, 1998](http://www.ucc.ie/ucc/research/biomerit/homef.html)\- The
Impact Project**

    

_The Impact Project_ is a European cooperative biotechnology program with
research institutions in eight states working together for the development of
microbial soil inoculants.   The significance of rhizosphere interactions is
discussed in the illustrated report "Microbiology of Agricultural Soils" which
explains the advantages of inoculants over mineral fertilizers for enhancing
plant growth. "Utilization of Microbes in the Field" provides a table of the
microbes presently used in soil inoculants. A third feature sums up the
concept of "Molecular Microbial Ecology and Innovative Biotechnology for
Agricultural Soils" and its importance to the future of sustainable
agriculture. Site by the Commission of the European Communities Directorate-
General XII Science, Research and Development, for IMPACT; Coordinator,  F.
O'Gara, Microbiology Department, University College, Cork, Ireland. (****)

Page**

    

Folks can't seem to resist growing plants foreign to their geographic area,
and this site is for those who would like to know about growing California
coastal redwood species in the southeastern United States. Offering a full
complement of redwood resources, the publishers also keep up with the progress
of redwoods in the southeast with their monthly edition of "Southern Redwood
News." Find also pages on redwood taxonomy and a table and description of
members of the Taxodiaceae at this site by Redwood Technology, Huntsville,

Development Research Center**

    

The International Development Research Centre was created to "help communities
in the developing world find solutions to social, economic, and environmental
problems through research." The Center's online magazine, "Reports: Science
from the Developing World"  contains a wealth of articles on topics of
pollution, conservation, preservation of indigenous knowledge, agriculture,
and health. A number of full-text books are also online for printing-on-
demand, whose themes encompass Environment and Biodiversity, Economics, Food
Systems, Health Information and Research Systems, Science and Technology,
Social Science and Humanities. Of particular interest to botanists is the book
"Farming Systems in the African Savanna" by Andrew Ker, though there is
material for just about any walk of the Life Sciences at this site by the
International Development Research Center, Ottawa, Canada.(****) _LF_

**[June 12, 1998](http://linus.socs.uts.edu.au/~don/larvae/larvae.html)\-
Caterpillars: especially Australian ones**

    

The taxonomy of Australia's 20,816 named species of butterflies and moths has
been based largely on the adult forms, or imagos, and  many of these species
are as yet still unidentifiable by their larval and pupal stage. The authors
of this website are engaged in documenting the life cycle stages of Australian
moths and butterflies, with links to descriptions and images of 564 Australian
Lepidoptera species, 286 with caterpillar pictures. Larval food plants are
indicated for each species, and the plant family is linked to Watson and
Dallwitz, a useful feature for comparing Australian insect/plant relationships
to those in other floras. Butterfly gardeners too will want to consider the
abundant info at this site by Don Herbison-Evans and Stella A. Crossley,
Australia.(****) _LF_

**[June 11, 1998](http://www.uah.edu/admin/Fac/grounds/index.html)\- The
University of Alabama in Huntsville Grounds Management Home Page**

    

The grounds department at this relatively new, 360-acre campus has a goal to
develop the campus property both for beauty and for its potential contribution
to learning about the performance of trees, shrubs, and perennials in the
local area. From the present collection of some 200 ornamental trees, by the
year 2000 it is planned that more than 400 ornamentals will be in this
southern landscape, the new materials now being grown from liners in a campus
nursery. Deciduous trees and conifers on campus are being catalogued with
photos and records of their pros and cons in the grounds maintenance program.
Featuring also a link to _The Trees of Reed College_ ,   there is a suggestion
here of what a neat web could be made of university grounds and
groundskeeping, beginning with this site by Robert Redmon, University of
Alabama, Huntsville, Alabama.(****) _LF_

**[June 10, 1998](http://home.earthlink.net/~redbudfarm/)\- The West African
Vegetable Homepage**

    

Here are pages for ten West African vegetables with short descriptions of
their culture and use, provided by a former Agricultural Extention Worker
trained at Makama Agricultural Training Institute in Sierra Leone. Pictures,
scientific names, alternate names, and facts on season of growth and harvest
include the better-known crops like cassava and amaranth, and some local
specialties like bologi ( _Crassocephalum biafrae_ ). Ethno-econo botanists
will surely want this bookmark for reference and its recipe for good old-
fashioned Groundnut Stew. Site design by Redbud Farm with information provided
by M. Haroun Hallack, now of West Virginia. (****) _LF_

Botany**

    

There are several noteworthy new features at the Smithsonian Botany site, in
addition to its heretofore primary feature, a catalog of botanically
illustrated Melastomataceae, Cactaceae, and Bromeliaceae. A Phylogenetic Key
to the Zingiberales distinguishes the families of the order,  illustrated with
images of the inflorescences typifying each. The Algae Home Page provides
techniques for the collection and preservation of algae, abstracts of recent
publications, and an outstanding page of Phycological Web Links. The Lichen
Home Page is good for finding out "What is a Lichen?" and there is timely
information posted on the XVI International Botanical Congress to be held in
1999 in St. Louis, Missouri, where all botanists eventually meet. Site by the
National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington

**[June 1, 1998](http://rdrugge.nai.net/Botanica/Bot1.htm)\- Botanical
Dermatology**

    

Every botanist should have access to a plant-induced dermatosis reference like
the Botanical Dermatology Chapter from _The Electronic Textbook of
Dermatology_. Covered in detail are the major categories of irritations caused
by plants- contact urticaria, allergic contact dermatitis, irritant
dermatitis, phytophotodermatitis, and occupational plant dermatitis, preceded
by a quick introduction to botanical nomenclature and classification. Disease
symptoms, the plants, their families, and their injurious chemicals are
discussed in an illustrated text. For the best botanists, who steer themselves
and their friends clear of poison ivy and never actually get to see a case,
are real life photos that clearly tell the tale at this site by the Internet
Dermatology Society with Thomas W. McGovern, Chief, Dermatology Service, Irwin
Army Community Hospital, Fort Riley, Kansas; and Theodore M. Barkley, Division
of Biology, Kansas State University, Manhattan, Kansas.(****) _LF_

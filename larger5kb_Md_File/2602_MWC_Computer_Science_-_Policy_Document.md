**1\. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT**

> Departmental policies and procedures have tended to evolve over time. Most
new policy decisions are formalized during department meetings and are
recorded in the official minutes of the meetings. This document provides a
central, convenient source of rules, regulations, requirements,
responsibilities, and general information which can be used by the current and
new faculty. Additional material will be added as new procedures and policies
are formulated.

**2\. PURPOSE AND ROLE OF THE DEPARTMENT**

> The department assists the college in fulfilling its mission by providing a
major course of study in a discipline essential in modern society. Because a
general education includes preparation in the use of the computer as a tool
for acquiring knowledge, organizing information, and solving problems, the
department also offers courses of importance and interest to non-majors. The
semester track book has a list of the department course offerings for the
current semester. The Mary Washington College Catalog has a general
description of each course the department offers. A detailed course outline
for each of the courses in the computer science core can be found on the
department web pag.

**5.2 Scholarships**

> The department has been instrumental in establishing four scholarships for
computer science students:

>

>> **The Ralph A. Niemann Scholarship in Computer Science** \-- awarded on
merit to a rising senior who is majoring in computer science.

>>

>> **The Society for World-Wide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, Inc.
(SWIFT) scholarship** \-- two scholarships awarded on merit and need to rising
juniors or seniors who are majoring in computer science and meets certain
residency requirements. Students who are residents of the counties of
Culpeper, Rappahannock, Madison, Orange, Spotsylvania, and Fauquier, the City
of Fredericksburg, or the northern Virginia area are given preference.
Applicants must have demonstrated financial need.

>>

>> **The Don and Kathleen Edwards Scholarsip in Computer Science \--** a
scholarship awarded to a declared major in computer science who is a resident
of Virginia and has demonstrated academic excellence and demonstrated
financial need.

>

> Interested students may apply for these scholarships when the department
circulates application announcements--usually each Spring. Copies of the
scholarship application form can be found on the department web page, under
the heading STUDENTS.

**5.3 The Local ACM Chapter**  


> The department encourages its students to participate in the local student
chapter of the ACM, which sponsors a yearly lecture series, occasional field
trips, and several social events each semester designed to provide interested
students with opportunities to interact with each other and with working
computer professionals.

**5.4 Advanced Placement (AP) Credit for Entering Freshmen**

> Entering freshmen who have taken the computer science AP exam will be exempt
as follows:  
>  
>

>> Students who earned a 4 or better on the A exam will be awarded three
credits and be exempted from CPSC 110. These students should select CPSC 220
to continue their studies in Computer Science.

>>

>> Students who earned a 3 on the A exam will be awarded three credits of
elective credit. These students should select CPSC 110 to continue their
studies in Computer Science.

>>

>> Students who earned a 4 or better on the AB exam will be awarded four
credits and be exempted from CPSC 220. These students should select CPSC 230
and CPSC 125 to continue their studies in Computer Science.

>>

>> Students who earned a 3 on the AB exam will be awarded three credits of
elective credit. These students should select CPSC 220 to continue their
studies in Computer Science.

**5.5 Credit by Examination**

> The department does not grant 'credit by examination' for any course. There
are no standardized tests for such examinations, and the department has no
funds to pay faculty to develop and administer such examinations. In the rare
instance when a student may have received equivalent course content by some
other means, a course substitution may be granted.

**5.6 Course Substitutions**

> A formal request by a student to substitute one or more alternative courses
for one required in the major may be granted. The request must be in writing
and must be brought before the full department for consideration and approval.
In general, the course to be substituted must have the same emphasis and
prerequisites as the one to be replaced.

**5.7 Waiver of Courses for BLS Students**

> On occasions, BLS students with considerable technical background can have
lower level courses waived, or can take both a course and its prerequisite
concurrently. The department considers requests of this type on an individual
basis, on the recommendation of the student's advisor/mentor.

**5.8 Credit Deficiencies/Translation for Transfer Students**  


> Transfer students who have a credit deficiency due to having attended an
institution on the quarter system, or because of differences in course credit
distribution, can make up the deficiency by taking an extra computer science
course at the 300 level or above.

>

> Transfer credit for courses taken elsewhere is determined by the department
after a review of the course content.

>

> **Transfer Equivalencies**

>

>> Here is a list of the computer science offerings at other state
institutions and the corrresponding courses offered at MWC

>>

**5.9 Force Adds**

> The term 'force add' refers to allowing a student to register for a class
section which is already full. Students most frequently request force adds
into the lower level classes. The number of workstations in laboratory B13
limit the number of students who can be enrolled in any section of the lower-
level classes (CPSC 110, CPSC 220, and CPSC 230). These classes are capped at
25 students. Under no circumstances are students allowed to force add these
classes during advanced registration. In rare instances, when all sections of
a course are full, a faculty member may allow a student to force add a lower
level course if the student is intending to major in computer science , and if
the department chairperson approves.

**5.10 Student Grievances**

> Official College procedures for the resolution of academic disputes between
students and faculty members are stated in the MWC Student Handbook. However,
every effort should be made to resolve differences at the departmental level.
In general, if the involved faculty member and student cannot settle a
grievance to the satisfaction of the student, the faculty member should then
send the student to the department chairperson.

**5.11 Helping Another Professor's Students**

> The feedback from helping ones own students is important in determining the
true difficulty of an assignment and often in discovering deficiencies in
background concepts. Encourage students to obtain help from their own
professors. However, if a student's professor is not on campus and this
student has a problem, then another professor can assist the student if he/she
wishes. In general, students are to be discouraged from asking "other
professors" for help instead of investigating the solution themselves.

**5.12 Internships**

> Internships are designed to give traditional non-working, full-time students
a real-life experience. They are not appropriate for students who are
currently employed in Computer Science related fields. Members of the
department should be sure to inquire of the student who applies for an
internship as to whether he/she is currently working in the field, before
granting internship permission.

>

> Students who have successfully completed CPSC 305 and CPSC 390 (or CPSC 311
and CPSC 321), and have a major GPA of 2.0 or higher may elect to complete an
internship. Any student whose major GPA is in the range 2.0 to 2.49 may take
an internship on a pass/fail basis. A student whose major GPA  is in the range
of 2.5 to 2.89 may take an internship on a graded basis, but not in
fulfillment of the requirements of the major. A student whose major GPA is 2.9
or higher may take an internship for graded credit and in fulfillment of one
of the requirements of the major.

>

> If a student has a GPA just short of the 2.9 required for graded credit
toward the major, he/she may still receive graded credit after a review of the
student's academic/computer science course history.

>

> A student must first get approval for the internship from one faculty member
in the department. The department chair will be the final signature authority
on the internship, and completed paperwork must be submitted to the department
chair for signature no later than the first Friday in the semester in which
the internship is to be done. Before the chair gives final approval, there
will be a review and approval of the application by the full department. The
above applies to internships during all semesters - Fall, Spring, as well as
Summer.

>

> The Internship application form can be found on the department web page.

**5.13 Individual Study**

> Individual study requests must be approved by a majority of the full-time
department faculty. Requests for enrollment need to be in writing. A copy of
the form is in on the department web page. Students who wish to enroll in
individual study CPSC 491 need to have successfully completed CPSC 305 and
CPSC 390 (or CPSC 311 and CPSC 321),  and should have at least a 2.7 major
GPA.

>

> In special cases when a student requesting an individual study project
either does not have the required minimum GPA of 2.7 or has not taken the
required prerequisite courses, permission can still be granted on the advice
of the sponsoring faculty member, after department meeting discussion and
approval of the department members.

>

> The department has also informally agreed that an oral presentation before
the department and interested students should be considered as an additional
requirement for individual study credit.

>

> The Individual Study application form can be found on the department web
page.

**5.14 Graduation with Departmental Honors**

> In order to graduate with departmental honors, the student must have an
overall GPA of 3.00, a major GPA of at least 3.25, must have completed two
semesters of individual study (3 credits each) culminating in a project of
superior quality, must be nominated by a member of the department faculty, and
must successfully present his/her thesis before the department.

**5.15 Outcomes Assessment**

> Outcomes Assessment consists of:

    1. A focus group session--a group discussion among randomly selected graduating seniors, moderated by faculty not currently instructing those seniors, to solicit student opinions about the adequacy of our program's administration and resource support. The focus group sessions will be conducted in alternating years, beginning with the 1993-94 academic year.
    2. Administration of the Major Field Achievement (MFAT) test--in order to compare the technical knowledge of MWC Computer Science students with Computer Science students at other institutions. This will be accomplished by having CPSC 405 students who had completed CPSC 401, and CPSC 401 students who had completed CPSC 405 take the MFAT test as a course requirement. The MFAT Test will be administered in alternating years, beginning with the 1994-95 academic year.
    3. A periodic alumni survey--mailed to recent Computer Science graduates, to gather their opinions on the overall effectiveness and relevance of our program. The survey will be administered every four years, beginning in the 1993-94 academic year.

**5.16 Department Honor Code (Revised 3/98)**

> A violation of the Honor Code is a very serious matter. **ACCESSING ANY
DIRECTORY THAT IS NOT YOURS WITHOUT PERMISSION OF THE OWNER IS A VIOLATION OF
THE HONOR CODE.** Other violations are listed here in a little more detail.
However, it is not meant to be an exhaustive list of possible violations. As
always do only your work. If others ask you for help please refer them to your
instructor.

    1. Accessing another student's files that are related to outstanding class assignments, or intentional alteration of current environment.
    2. Allowing another student access to files pertaining to outstanding class assignments. Each home directory should be protected by a password.
    3. Intentionally picking up another student's program listing that pertains to an outstanding class assignment.
    4. Falsifying output.
    5. Examining a listing inadvertently obtained after you are aware that it is not yours, or failure to return said listing.

  
Every CPSC faculty member **MUST** include a statement regarding the degree of
cooperation permitted on outside class assignments in each course syllabus.

**6\. PROCEDURES, POLICIES, AND INFORMATION RELATING TO FACULTY AND STAFF**

**6.1 Student Aides**

> Each semester, given that funding is available, the department hires a
limited number of interested department majors as student aides. In general,
their responsibilities include assisting instructors during lab sessions,
answering student questions regarding assignments and equipment operation,
assisting in the operation of the department equipment, and assisting the
faculty in preparing course materials. The faculty member who supervises the
aides requests that each faculty member supply an estimate of the number of
hours and, if possible, specific schedules when student aides will be needed.

**6.2 Course Syllabi**

> At the beginning of each semester, faculty members must submit to the
department secretary a copy of the course syllabus for each course that they
will be teaching.

**6.3 Business Cards**

> Business cards with the MWC logo are available for department faculty
members. See the department secretary for information.

**6.4 Membership Dues for Professional Organizations**

> Within reason, faculty dues for membership in professional societies are
paid by the department. Applications and renewal notices should be taken to
the department secretary for processing.

**6.5 Responsibilities of the Department Secretary**

> The department secretary works half-time for Computer Science and half-time
for Mathematics. The secretary's office is in the Mathematics Department,
Trinkle Hall, room 127. The responsibilities of the position include:

    1. handling travel requests and reimbursements
    2. handling department purchases
    3. maintaining department personnel and administrative files
    4. maintaining office hours lists
    5. maintaining copies of course syllabi
    6. ordering business cards
    7. typing official letters
    8. ordering desk/examination copies of textbooks
    9. handling professional society dues payments
    10. handling general office work requests
    11. maintaining individual study forms

**6.6 Coverage of Classes/Exams when Professor is Absent**

> If an instructor is out of town or is otherwise unable to meet a class, he
is expected to notify the department chair of his absence and have a
contingency plan if possible. For exams, a faculty member must be present to
distribute and collect the student examination papers.

**6.7 Determination of Grades for Courses in the Major**

> Students are evaluated, and grades are assigned, on the basis of written
examinations and outside-class exercises of various kinds, with other factors
such as oral or written reports included when applicable. For those courses in
the major, the department requires each passing student to have a minimum
passing grade of 60 on each of outside work average and examination average
and limits the weight of the outside work average to 40% of final grade.
Course grading schemes are otherwise left up to the instructor.

**6.10 Merit Pay Plan For The Department( Revised: Dec. 16, 1997)**

> As part of its discussion regarding our updated Merit Pay Plan, the
department addressed the overall concept. The Computer Science faculty has
always found it beneficial to work cooperatively and share teaching materials
and experiences. The premise of extra compensation for greater success is
discouraging to the cooperative effort by seeking ways of differentiating
faculty achievement. In addition, the department feels that the time and
energy expended on the preparation of materials for this evaluation and the
other activities associated with it could be better spent. Because of these
beliefs, the department voted to include the following statement in our plan."
The department believes that a merit pay system is detrimental to faculty
morale, and this document is not to be interpreted as support for that system.
We realize that a merit pay system is required by the College Administration
in response to direction from the State Department of Education. In the event
a merit pay system is no longer required by the state, the department will
happily abandon this policy."

>

> **INTRODUCTION**

>

> All department members are meritorious in their own ways. The department
also realizes that the chair is responsible for the final merit
recommendations. It is the consensus that the evaluation process not be the
sole responsibility of the chair, but that department members conduct peer
reviews of materials agreed upon. Each reviewer will also do a self-review.
Using the prepared portfolios, the areas of teaching, professional activity,
and service will be examined using the criteria in the Faculty Handbook . The
faculty member's efforts in support of the department's program and goals will
also be taken into consideration. The department recognizes that each reviewer
may interpret these criteria in his/her own way. In addition, a peer may
incorporate personal observations regarding the quality of the activities
discussed in the portfolio. In such cases, a written note must be included on
the evaluation form. A positive feature of a peer review is that differing and
individual value systems contribute to a much fairer composite than can be
obtained by a single evaluator. Thus, one has a better chance for equitable
distribution of merit ("sharing the wealth") while also distributing the
decision ("sharing the blame").

>

> **Section 2.5.2 (Performance Criteria)** of the handbook states that meeting
basic expectations is a necessary condition for favorable consideration of
merit (or tenure/promotion) but may not in itself be sufficient to achieve
such recognition. That is, faculty must demonstrate high standards of
effectiveness beyond basic expectations. Since MWC emphasizes teaching
effectiveness over professional activity and service, then "the standard of
teaching effectiveness insisted upon is higher than that for professional
accomplishment and service effectiveness."

>

> **CRITERIA**

>

> As a baseline, we will choose appropriate criteria, listed in the Faculty
Handbook, for teaching, professional activity, and service. We may
add/eliminate criteria as the plan matures and we gain experience. **Section
2.5.2 (Performance Criteria)** of the handbook states that meeting basic
expectations is a necessary condition for favorable consideration of merit (or
tenure/ promotion) but may not in itself be sufficient to achieve such
recognition. That is, faculty must demonstrate high standards of effectiveness
beyond basic expectations. Since MWC emphasizes teaching effectiveness over
professional activity and service, then "the standard of teaching
effectiveness insisted upon is higher than that for professional
accomplishment and service effectiveness."

>

> **PORTFOLIO**

>

> Each member of the department will prepare a portfolio that contains the
evidence necessary to allow an evaluation against the criteria. This portfolio
should contain, but is not limited to: syllabi, sample assignments/tests,
Annual Activities Report, and course evaluation results. Possibly, the most
important document will be the Annual Activities Report. Individuals should
take care to provide sufficient information and interpretation. For example,
one may include and interpret student comments. One should mention courses
which were taught for the first time or required extensive update and
revision. In describing professional activity, one should note those
activities that were juried and where appropriate include letters from outside
sources describing the activity and its evaluation. More attention to detail
will be necessary when evaluating committee service. For example, what were
your contributions as a member and/or officer?

>

> **EVALUATION**

>

> An evaluation form will be prepared listing the categories of teaching,
professional activity, and service. (The department thinks this documentation
is necessary to help resolve any disputes regarding final distribution of
merit pay.) For each item on the form, the evaluator assigns a value from 0 to
3. Each number can be interpreted as follows:

>

>> **0** <= "fails to meet expectation"< **1**

>>

>> **1** <= "meets expectation " < **2**

>>

>> **2** <= "significant contribution" < **3**

>>

>> "outstanding contribution" = **3**

>

> The values of 0 to 3 can be assessed by comparing all candidates who
performed similar duties during the evaluation year. Regardless, it is the
chair's responsibility to detect and correct any inconsistencies that arise.
Finally, a member that gets all zeros within service, for example, obviously
forfeits any chance for merit recognition in that category. All full-time
members of the department will evaluate each other as well as themselves. The
chair will also evaluate all members of the department. The identity and
assessment of each reviewer will only be known by the chair. On the initial
review of any portfolio, the reviewer will not be required to support assigned
numbers with written commentary unless the basis for some of the evaluation
included personal observation. To require extensive commentary at the outset
is counter-productive, and will probably further dampen what little enthusiasm
exists for the merit pay process in general. However, the chair is allowed to
ask for written justification for any "numbers" that fly in the face of the
evidence or that differ significantly from those of other reviewers. In the
case of disputes, all review sheets, sans reviewer identity, will be made
available to the complainant. We propose computing a weighted average over the
three categories, with teaching 55%, professional activity 25%, and service
20%. The final assessment is done as follows:

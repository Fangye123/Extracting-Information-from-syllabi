**Semester: Fall 2000**

**Prerequisites:**

CHEM 102

**Text:**

John McMurry, 5th Edition, 2000, Organic Chemistry, Pacific Grove, CA:
Brooks/Cole.  A copy of textbook and notebook are required of each student.

**Course Description:**

A systematic study of the nomenclature, structures, preparation, properties
and reaction of staff classes of carbon compounds, namely, alkanes, alkenes,
and alkynes.  Emphasis is placed on modern theories of structure and bonding
and reaction mechanisms of addition reactions, elimination reactions and
nucleophilic substitution reactions.  Three hours of lecture and one three-
hour lab per week.

**Objectives:**

This course is designed for science majors.  Students will be albe to
demonstrate problme solving approaches fundamental to chemistry.  Students
will be albe to use chemical nomenclature for organic compounds appropriately.
Students will become familiar with bonding and molecular structure and with
writing reactions for organic reactions.

**Method of Instruction:**

Lecture, discussion, computer-assisted learning, and student homework
assignments and independent research will be utilized in this course.
Students are encourage to communicate with the instructor via email and to
take full advantage of the instructor's office hours.

**Course Requirements:**

Students will be required to complete and submit problem sets, take quizzes,
and four unit examinations.  Students are also required to keep a lecture
notebook, which will be submitted tot he instructor periodically.  Laboratory
attendance is required.  The final examination is comprehensive.

Evaluation of Students:

Lecture        75%                            90% or above      = A  
_Laboratory    25%_                            80-89%               = B  
Course        100%                           70-79%               = C  
                                                        60-69%              = D   
                                                        Below 60%         = F 

Lecture will be evaluated using the following:

Unit examinations                        55%  
Problem Sets & Quizzes             15%  
_Final Examination                         30%_  
                                                  100% 

**Attendance Policy:**

The college expects all students to be on time and attend all class meetings.
Absences will be excused and permission will be granted to make up assignments
and tests only if the following conditions are met:

    1)  the student supplies a valid doctor's statement of illness   
    2)  proof of absence of scheduled school activity such as college's team games, field trips, etc.   
    3)  proof of absence because of death in the immediate family   
    4)  any other reason deem valid by the instructor   
*  Late homework will not be accepted without a valid excused absence.  The will be no make-up quizzes. 

If you know that you will be absent for a school sponsored event, make
arrangements with the professor **in advance** as to how you will meet the
requirements for the missed day.   If you are ill or have an emergency,
contact the professor as soon as possible.

**Test Taking Policy:**

Students are expected to arrive to class on time on the day of the test.
Students arriving to class more than ten minutes late **WILL NOT** be
administered a test.

**Policies Related to Students with Disabilities:**

If you have special needs or considerations which must be taken into account
for you to be successful in this class, please contact the instructor as soon
as possible.

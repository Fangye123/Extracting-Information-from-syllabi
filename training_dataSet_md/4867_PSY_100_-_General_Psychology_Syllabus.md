**INSTRUCTIONAL METHODS:   The method of instruction will include lecture,
discussion, multimedia presentations, and group discussions/assignments.  Some
written work requiring research in the library may be assigned.  Students may
also complete writing assignments that may include in-class writing
assignments, written exam questions, and/or a class journal.**

**QUALITY STANDARDS:   Except for in-class assignments, no hand written work
will be accepted.  All work must be typed or completed with a word processing
program.  Projects are to be submitted on the assigned date or a penalty will
be assessed.  If there is a problem  meeting a due date, arrangements should
be made in advance with the professor. __In the event that a major examination
is missed, students will be required to provide documentation of an excused
absence before permission to take the exam will be granted.__**

**NOTE - _All cellular phones should be turned off or in vibrate mode before
class begins!_**

**REQUIREMENTS**

**_Examinations_ \- Three exams consisting of objective items will be
completed by the** **student.**

**_Final Examination_ \- The final exam will be comprehensive and consist of
objective** **items to be completed by the student.**

**__Content Engagement__ \- Quizzes will be administered periodically via the
internet on the reading assignment or the previous week's discussion. Students
may keep their ten highest scores from among those given to apply toward their
final grades. __No make-up quizzes will be given under any circumstance if not
taken within the specified timeframe.__   Quizzes are open-book and open-note;
however, to be completed without help from other individuals.  Only your
personal integrity will insure this aspect of your learning experience.**

**__Class Participation__ \- Class participation will be measured by postings
to the Discussion Board.   This grade will be determined, not necessarily by
the number of postings per student, but, by the quality of the postings.  For
some discussions, we will have a guest discussant from another college or
university.  ALL students are expected to engage in these discussions.**

*** _NOTE_ \- After taking an online quiz, you will immediately be given your
grade and it will be recorded in your grade record available to you at all
time on the website.   Students are encouraged to check their grades on
_Blackboard_ (the password protected area of the website) frequently to make
sure that all quiz scores were recorded.   Once a quiz has been removed from
the website, there will be no makeup for that quiz if your grade did not
automatically record.  Should this occur, bring it to Dr. Cochran's attention
immediately.**

**Also, save all of your email correspondence and work until the end of the
semester.   It is a safeguard for you should there be a decrepancy in your
grade or some other matter.**

**MISCELLANEOUS**

**_Student Recommendations_ \- Students often need recommendations for various
reasons (jobs, admission to graduate school, teacher education programs,
etc.).   Dr. Cochran will be happy to help you by preparing  an objective
recommendation.  However, please do not ask Dr. Cochran to provide a
recommendation before the tenth week of class unless you have had him in a
previous class/semester.  Adequate time must be given to observe the quality
of your work and your responsibility as a student.**

**Occassionally, some students find it necessary to bring small children with
them for various** **reasons. According to school policy, students must clear
this with Dr. Cochran before** **bringing a child to class. Under no
circumstances is a child to be left unattended in the hallsor building while
attending a class.**

**_Manual of Style_ \- The Publication Manual of the American Psychological
Association (5th ed.) is the accepted format for the fields of education and
psychology.**

**_Web site_ \- Dr. Cochran maintains an extensive web site that will benefit
you in many ways. If for some reason you must miss class, you will frequently
be able to retrieve many of the materials used in class. Assignment
information, syllabi, project help, exam reviews, quiz announcements,
opportunities for extra credit, and many other resources may be found.
Students are encouraged to become thoroughly familiar with their course
website and check it frequently for updates and changes.**

**_Attendance_ \- For classes that meet on-campus:   Statistical analyses
across all of Dr. Cochran's on-campus classes revealed that there is a highly
significant negative correlation between attendance and final grade in the
course (N > 400; r = - .78). This is especially true for evening classes that
meet only one time weekly (the correlation is robust ( N = 38; r = -.95); and
PSY 100 - General Psychology classes (N = 24; r = -.90). This simply means
that  the more abscences students have, the lower their final grade will
usually be. On the contrary, students who have fewer abscences tend to have
much higher final grades.**

**_Contacting Dr. Cochran_ \- When the need to contact Dr. Cochran arises,
please consider the following options (preferrably in this order):   email,
phone, visit to office.  Also, please refrain from sending jokes, humorous
emails or websites, poems, stories, etc.  The number of emails Dr. Cochran
receives on a daily basis is phenomenal.  Non-essential correspondence will
only delay the response to more importance and essential correspondence.
Also, when you have questions that do not require an immediate response, try
posting them on the Discussion Board first.  It is likely that other students
will be able to help resolve your question/problem without contacting the
professor.  Dr. Cochran monitors the discussion board and if erroneous
information if posted, he will post a correction and/or contact the
individual(s) to clarify the issue.  Such activity is an important part of the
learning experience and could be considered to replace in-class discussion.**

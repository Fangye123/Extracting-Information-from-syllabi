  **Program Overview**

We will visit some of the leading technology firms in Europe, including:
Airbus Industrie (Aerospatiale) in Toulouse, France (which is one of only two
firms in the world that produces large passenger jets); British Telecom's
research facility at Martlesham Heath, Ipswich, England; IBM and Cap Gemini in
Paris, France; Swisscom and the Swiss Federal Government in Bern, Switzerland;
KPMG Consulting in Vienna, Austria; Siemens Semiconductor AG in Munich,
Germany; and Probanka in Maribor, Slovenia. Cultural, historical, and scenic
highlights will include a guided tour of all the major cities visited, a
typical English village and pub, the Eurostar (Chunnel) train, the many
alluring sights of Paris (the City of Lights) and Toulouse (the Ville Rose),
Nice on the French Riviera, five small villages clinging to the cliffs on the
Italian coast (Cinque Terre) , Florence and Venice, Italy, the Montreux Jazz
Festival, Bern (perhaps the most beautiful city in Europe), the majestic Alps
and lakes of the Berner Oberland, Munich in Bavaria, the Austrian Alps,
Maribor on the Drava, and Vienna (the seat of the Hapsburg Empire).

In keeping with the goal of learning to travel independently, students will
plan much of their own sightseeing from the wide choice of sights available in
each city. This study abroad is designed to recognize that individual students
may want to pursue differing interests.   **Purpose of the Program**

Europe provides a unique opportunity to study information systems technology
in a multinational and fast changing business environment. This study abroad
will provide students with the opportunity to:

     1\. Study the development and application of information technology in leading European firms,
     2\. Examine business firms that operate in an environment that requires export, international consortiums, and changes to  accommodate the future common currency and harmonized macro economic policies,
     3\. Learn about a telecommunications industry that is still adjusting to privatization, that is, in some ways, ahead of the United States in cell phone technology, and is now an integral part of information technology,
     4\. Explore diverse European cultures, art, history, and economic policies, and
     5\. Learn the skills necessary to travel independently in foreign countries. Students will have the option of traveling independently for seven days after the conducted portion of the study.

for Survey Courses under the [Research Links](../rsrchlink.html).

the exams and research projects -- offers evidence of (a) careful and
thoughtful textual analysis and (b) clarity of expression, organization, and
development of ideas through useful textual examples. The final grade will be
determined as follows:

**Course Description and Requirements**

  * The course is a survey of world societies, with appropriate emphasis on Western Civilization, but from a truly global perspective.   The chronology runs from the period of the Renaissance and Reformation through the twentieth century.  The course and its readings assume the importance of the processes of globalization, both as developed during and since the early modern era, and as formally noted during the late twentieth century.
  * The survey course involves the study of prominent events, trends and personalities.   The assigned readings will support the class discussions and lectures.  Classroom discussions require you to take the time and effort to read before you come to class.  On occasion discussion groups will be assigned in order to facilitate discussion.
  * Your experience in this course will include reading, writing, discussing, and of course thinking about historical events, personalities and themes.  The quality of your experience will depend ultimately on you and your committed participation in the course process.

**Course Goals**

  * To acquaint students with the diverse societies of the last 500 years and the continuing interrelatedness of   global societies and systems;
  * To acquaint students with the major developments of western and world societies since the Renaissance;
  * To engage students in historical inquiry as a means of encouraging them to take a critical approach to  historical matters; and,
  * To encourage student to consider the subsequent influence of varied historical developments on societies  until the present time.

**Class Attendance**  
In accordance with the University attendance policy, "Attendance at all
meetings of the course for which a student is registered is expected.  To be
eligible to earn credit in a course, the student must attend at least 75
percent of all class meetings."  Other details of the attendance policy are
found in the current catalog.  Emergencies, of course, may prevent your
attendance, but you should endeavor to limit the undesirable influence of
emergencies, particularly on examination days.  Your instructor assumes that
you, by enrolling in the course, have declared it a priority for your use of
time and effort on the scheduled days and at the scheduled hours.  Your
habitual absence or tardiness suggests that you may indeed have more important
matters to attend to, and that you will be less concerned about the course and
its benefits.  Certain planned, excused absences relating to university
business or activities do occur, but they do apply to the attendance standard,
regardless.  Make prior arrangements with the professor as neededin order to
keep up with your work.  Absences for exams or class reports will be excused
only for documented medical reasons or by prior arrangement for legitimate
reasons.

**Class Participation**  
Participation involves many factors, most important of which are attendance,
participation in discussion, pre-class preparation through reading the
assigned textbook chapters, timely submission of out-of-class assignments, and
taking the examinations at the scheduled times.  The timely, conscientious
completion of assignments displays honest commitment to the course.
Assignments will be penalized one grade point per day late.  Do not test this
rule.

**The Course Process**

  * **Examinations will assume your familiarity with and will be based on, in order:   the class lectures, the textbook readings, and the required supplemental readings.**  **The student study guide resources for history and geography are crucial.   Plan to spend some appreciable time working with them.**
  * The course this semester is set on a points basis (see Evaluation Section below).  You may earn points on the examinations and on the writing assignments.

**Book Review Instructions and Guidelines**

  * **A book review is not the same as a book report**.   The purpose is not primarily to provide a _brief_ synopsis of the book, but to **analyze and evaluate** it.   The guidelines will get you started on the review; you may look at examples of scholarly reviews in the library in _The American Historical Review_ or _The Historian_ or similar journals.   See Jules R. Benjamin's _The Student's Guide to History_ for additional guidelines and hints; on reserve in the library, for sale in the bookstore.
  * **The review should be five to ten pages, typed.**   Refer to Turabian's style guide for particulars.  Paper clip your pages together, no folders or covers, no title page.  The heading may follow this model:
    * Yahil, Leni.  _The Holocaust:   The Fate of European Jewry, 1932-1945_.  Translated by Ina Friedman and         Haya Galai.  New York & Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1990.  pp. xviii + 808.  Review by Jerry Summers.
  * **General guidelines for the review:**
    * Include a _brief_ summary or synopsis of the book.   State its thesis or theme or purpose.  Provide some background information on the author's qualifications, publishing background, and personal information.
    * Discuss the author's argument, the evidence used to support the thesis, theme, or purpose.  What is the author's perspective?  Is there bias (find out what this means before you discuss it)?  What is it and how does it influence the book?  How did you react to it?  What examples can you present to support your comments?  Your review must incorporate a logical, reasoned, thorough analysis of the book, not merely a reflective overview.  That won't do.
    * Discuss the ways the book enhanced or influenced your study of history.  Give examples.  What connections did you make between the context and assumptions of the author and anything related to historical developments during the time period or periods associated with the book?  There are no limits to this, so don't come asking the professor for guidance as to "just exactly" what he wants.
    * Discuss the readability of the book (and your own qualifications to read it), the tone and presentation of its contents, its physical features that added to or detracted from it; how, overall, do you evaluate the book, and how would you argue with or agree with the author on any number of points?
    * As with any professional or collegiate paper: attend to spelling, punctuation, grammar, syntax.  Any faults in proper usage of English detract from communication and thus from the quality and grade of your paper.  Problems with writing?  Go to the ETBU English writing lab for help.  I also can recommend the UTEP history writing helps on the web at: http://www.utep.edu/htc/tips/essay.htm
    * Do not cover your paper.  A cover sheet is adequate.  Staple rather than paper clip your paper.  The paper must be submitted on time, or be subject to one full grade point reduction per day it's late.  There will be no exceptions.  The paper is due at the beginning of the class period on the date due.  Cyberexcuses at the last minute will gain no sympathy.  You must be responsible.  The paper may be submitted early.

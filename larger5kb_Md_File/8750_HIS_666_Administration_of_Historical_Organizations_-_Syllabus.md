_Catalog Description_

A comprehensive consideration of the issues involved in the administration and
management of historical organizations, including museums, archives and
special collections libraries, historic preservation organizations, and local
historical societies.

_Instructor Comments_

The course will combine lectures by the instructor and guest lecturers,
videos, and in class discussion of assigned readings. There will be several
field trips in which all students are expected to participate. Each student
will prepare a semester project which will be presented in class. The final
examination will be a take home exam, the details will be discussed in class
near the end of the semester.

Since much of the course will draw on [my experience in the field of public
history](Bill.htm), I have outlined it for those in the class.

ATTENDANCE POLICY

Regular class attendance is expected of all students. Absence from four
classes will reduce the final letter grade by one full letter; six absences by
two full letters; etc. Students are responsible on the examination for all
material presented in class and all of the assigned readings. If you miss
class review someone else's notes and see me during office hours if you have
any questions.  
Students are also responsible for any changes in the lecture schedule that is
announced in class. Absence when a change was announced will not be accepted
as an excuse for missing an examination.

* * *

ACADEMIC HONESTY

It is assumed and expected that all students will present only their own work
on exams and the written assignment. Any student caught cheating will fail the
course and all such incidents will be referred to appropriate University
officials for further action, including expulsion from the University.
Plagiarism, i.e. copying material verbatim (i.e. word-for-word) without
attribution, on the writing assignment is included in the definition of
cheating.

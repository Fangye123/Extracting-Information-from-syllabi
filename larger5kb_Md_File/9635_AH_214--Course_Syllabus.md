| **Paper** |  The term paper should be a comparative analysis of any subject
matter that can be shared between two eras or styles encompassed in AH 214. It
should be between 8-10 pages in length, typewritten with accompanying examples
included and have a bibliography and footnotes. You must have the topic  
approved by me before you start your research. Sources for some of your
research can include museums and galleries in the area as well as on the
Internet, and major references found in any library. Poor grammar and
typographical errors will result in letter grade reduction, so proofread your
papers! If you don't know what a footnote is, tell me, or find out for
yourself, because you need to use them in your papers. I will deduct if you
don't include them!

**If the paper is not turned in on May 23, 2002 by 5pm, you will receive an

| **Threaded  
Discussions** |  The Threaded Discussion page will be your participation
grade. We will try to meet on-line as well in a predetermined chat area, to
discuss topics from your reading. Participation is required. Be aware that a
normal AOL account will not work with AOL Instant Messenger chat rooms.

| **How to pass this Internet Course** |  Art History as an Internet course
requires a great deal of self-discipline and work on the part of the student.
You will be taking this course at your own pace to a certain degree. Read the
assigned text chapters (see the assignment page of this site course). Your
Study Guides that accompanies the Stokstad texts is a great way to prepare for
the tests; fill out the appropriate sections as you read, and review them when
studying for the test. Make sure you visit the course website regularly. We
will try to meet on-line as a class to discuss various topics related to the
assignments, as well as answer questions concerning the course. I will e-mail
you about these meetings. By the way, it would be wise to read The Guide to
Online Learning in the Course Documents area, especially if you have never
taken an Internet course before.

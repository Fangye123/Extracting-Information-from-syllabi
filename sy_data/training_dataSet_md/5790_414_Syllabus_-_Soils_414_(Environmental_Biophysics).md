that the associated lab class (415/515) be taken simultaneously.

**Course Prerequisites _:_**  
414 - Upper division standing in biological, physical, or earth sciences, or
engineering  
514 - Graduate standing in biological, physical, or earth sciences, or
engineering

**Course Objective** Students will use physical principles and reasoning to
describe microenvironments of living organisms and energy and mass transfer
between organisms and their environment. Within this objective, more specific
_course goals_ include:

*  Increased understanding of microclimates and their effect on organisms;

*  Learning to _understand and work with_ mathematical expressions to make estimations where measured values are lacking;

*  Learning to use microclimatic variables and transfer laws and associated mathematical expressions to estimate transfer of energy, water, and gases between organisms and the environment.

**Topic Outline**

I. _Principles of_ and _mathematical expressions for_ physical
microenvironment variables

\- Temperature  
\- Water (vapor and liquid)  
\- Wind  
\- Radiation

II. Simple models of energy and mass exchange

\- Overview of transport laws  
\- Conduction and diffusion  
\- Convection and turbulence

III. Applications

\- Soil temperature and heat flow  
\- To animals  
\- To plant leaves, canopies

**Evaluation of Learning:**

**_Quizzes_ :** Approximately seven (7) announced quizzes (15 to 30 min long)
will be given over the semester, including one in the scheduled final exam
period (TBA). Because an important part of the class is learning how to
_choose and use_ the relevant equations, students will be allowed to bring one
3 x 5 index card to each quiz containing equations relevant to material
covered (in other words, _understanding_ and _use_ of equations is emphasized,
not memorization!).

**_Homework_ :** Due to the abundance of new terms and equations in each
section, homework will be given frequently. These assignments will consist of
problems to be solved using the principles and relations in past and current
course material, as well as discussion questions designed to draw
relationships between the subject material and our every day lives.

The homework will be checked but not graded other than for participation. Each
assignment will be worth 1 point. The homework total will carry the same
weight as one quiz (below). In some cases the problems may include a computer
exercise, given by the instructor or available on the Internet.

The problem portion of the assignments should be submitted neatly on paper.
SHOW ALL WORK when solving problems. The major goal of the problem sets is to
give you practice working with the concepts and relationships described in
class. (The online discussion portion of the assignments does not need to be
printed out.) Your time spent on these assignments will greatly aid in your
understanding of the fundamentals.

**_Class attendance_ ** is considered to be an essential component of this
course. Class participation is encouraged, especially if questions and
comments reflect thought and preparation of the material.

**_514 Requirements_ : **In addition to the homework and quizzes discussed
above, students enrolled in 514 are also required to complete and present
(written and oral) an independent research project. 514 students are required
to meet an additional hour (arranged time) approximately weekly to plan and
discuss the research projects, including related literature and skills
necessary to carry out the research.

\- The project will involve data analysis or modeling relevant to the
student's own field of interest. A journal-quality written report of the
project and results is due to the instructor by April 21. A 10 minute
professional-quality oral presentation of the work and findings will be given
to the group taking the 500-level version. More details will be provided in a
separate handout.

\- Students who are also enrolled in 515 may combine research projects for the
two classes so that the project can involve both field data collection and
modeling/analysis.  


**_Final Grade Determination:_**

**414** \- Grades will be based on the scores of the quizzes plus completion
of the homework.  
**514** \- The research project and presentation will account for 20% of the
final grade. The remaining portion of the final grade will be based on the
scores of the quizzes plus completion of the homework (80%).

**Students with Disabilities:** Reasonable accommodation will be made for
students who have a documented disability. Please notify the instructor during
the first week of class of any accommodation needed for the course. Late
notification may mean that the requested accommodation cannot be made.

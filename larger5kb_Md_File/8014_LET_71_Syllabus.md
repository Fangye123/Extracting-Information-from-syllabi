GRADING: Test I--20%; Test II--30%; term paper (7-8pp.)--20%; final exam--30%.  
  
THIS CLASS IS REQUIRED FOR VISUAL ANALYSIS MAJORS AND MINORS; IT MAY BE
COUNTED TOWARD THE 13 CREDIT REQUIREMENT IN MEDIA STUDIES FOR OTHER MAJORS AND
FOR THE FINE ARTS DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT.  
  
My grading system is intended to clearly show you how you are doing relative
to the 100 points allotted for the class; thus, each assignment carries the
number of points reflected in its percentage (Test 1=20 points, etc.). I
achieve this by assigning point values of 1/4, 1/2, 1, etc. to the questions,
so there are still plenty of questions on each test. The letter grades on the
assignments are based on the same ten-percentile system that applies to grades
on the course. So, in the course the A range is from 90-100, B from 80-89,
etc. (with +'s and -'s, if appropriate, determined by my overall evaluation of
your work); on Test I the A range is still the top 10 percent (2 points), with
some type of A for scores in the 18-20 range, some type of B for 16-17.75, C's
14-15.75, D's 12-13.75, and F's for any score below 12. On Test II and the
Final the A range is 27-30, the B range is 24-26.75, C's 21-23.75, D's
18-20.75, and F's below 18. It's the same process as when you get 100 or more
points for any individual test, but this way you don't have to further
calculate 20% of this 100 and 30% of that 100 and so on. I'll explain this
again when we go over each test; please ask for any further clarification if
you need it.

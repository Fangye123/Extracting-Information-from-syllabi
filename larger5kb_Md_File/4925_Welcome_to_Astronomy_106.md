#### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

Exploring the Cosmos, parts I and II, is designed to give you an overall look
at the history of astronomy, the techniques and equipment used to make
astronomical observations, the life cycle of stars, the theories of the
evolution of our solar system and galaxy, and the theories of the our entire
universe. Part I of this course will cover chapters 1-8 and 17-24, which
include the basics of our view of the sky, telescopes, the nature of light,
our solar system, and the life cycle of stars all the way to black holes. Part
II will cover the remaining chapters, which include the evolution of galaxies,
clusters and superclusters, basic cosmology, and a survey of our solar
system's bodies.  
  
These courses are meant primarily for non-science majors, though they are also
the introductory courses for physics students with an astrophysics interest.
Students will be expected to perform only basic algebraic and mathematical
calculations to support various theories; no high level mathematics is
required. (Basic Algebra is a course pre-requisite!) While learning about the
solar system and the stars, you will learn physical relationships between
quantities such as temperature, pressure, brightness, distance, speed, angle,
etc. You will also learn to interpret data to make informed decisions about
astronomical theories, particularly in the laboratory exercises which
accompany the lecture.  
  
The laboratory exercises will also include a simple observing project which
will be due later in the semester. Other than that project, there are few
observational requirements for this course. However, the graduate students
teaching the laboratory and I are all available to conduct viewing exercises
as required. There are small telescopes in the astronomy laboratory that you
may check out from the lab instructor or from me. If you know of an upcoming
astronomical event or would just like the opportunity to look through a scope
at whatever might be visible, please make your request known and we'll
schedule a viewing. If you wish to be notified of any last-minute observing
activities, send me an email message so that I may add you to my viewing list.
Also, the Von Braun Astronomical Society has an observatory and planetarium on
Monte Sano Mountain which is open quite often to the public for planetarium
shows and general observing. Visit their website at
[www.vbas.org](http://www.vbas.org/) for more information  

#### HOMEWORK:

Homework assignment due dates are listed below with assignments due at the
beginning of class, folded, stapled, with your full name written legibly on
the outside. Many homework problems are based on information contained in the
"boxes" within the chapters. Late homework may be submitted TO ME with a
penalty of 25% per day late; written excuses required from an appropriate
authority for no penalty.  

#### RETURNS:

Homework assignments will be returned in class within two class periods. All
homework will be available before an exam. If you are absent when assignments
are returned, you can retrieve them from a box outside my office. Exams will
also be returned in class within two class periods or can be picked up from me
during office hours after the second class period; I do not leave exams in the
box outside my office.  

#### SOLUTIONS:

After the due date, solutions to the homework assignments will be posted on
the main syllabus web page as gif files. The solutions are good study aids as
I often supply more information than necessary to answer the question. This is
my way of "going over the homework".  

#### EXAMS:

My exams reflect the homework, examples that I work in class and discussions
in lecture and in your book. Exam grades may be scaled to give a class average
of 75%, should the class average be lower than this. If you don't come to
class and/or don't do homework, you will find it difficult to pass the exams!
No early exams. Notification of absence for an exam must be made within 24
hours of exam time. There is an answering machine on my office phone for this
purpose. Makeup exams, which may be oral or more difficult, will only be given
for absences with a written excuse from the dean.  

#### LABORATORY:

The laboratory will be taught by a graduate student and/or experienced
undergraduates. The grade will be averaged with your class grade as shown
above. Many students do well enough in the lab to raise their overall class
grade. ATTENDANCE IS MANDATORY TO PERFORM THE EXPERIMENTS; LAB REPORTS BASED
ON EXPERIMENTS THAT YOU DID NOT PERFORM WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.

#### PREFLIGHTS/WARM-UPS/QUIZZES

I am trying out a new teaching style that tries to use the WWW as a fast-
response feedback loop. Before each Wed/Fri class, a Quiz will be posted on
the WWW, which must be completed before 8:00 AM on the day that it is
assigned. PLEASE do not try to take the quiz after the deadline time, I will
not be able to accept it. These quizzes will form the basis of the following
lecture. A web site describing this approach can be found at the [JiTT
Website](http://webphysics.iupui.edu/jitt/jitt.html).  

#### GRADING:

The final grade will be derived from:  

  * Exam #1----------15%
  * Exam #2----------15%
  * Final Exam---------20%
  * Labs-------------25%
  * Quizzes-----------10%
  * Homework---------15%

I use an absolute scale for letter grades:  

  * 90-100 = A
  * 80--90 = B
  * 70--80 = C
  * 60--70 = D
  * 00--60 = N/C

Note that beginning in 2000, the "F" grade is replaced with a "N/C" for all
100-level physics courses. That is, failing will no longer reduce your GPA,
but it will be treated as if you had withdrawn.

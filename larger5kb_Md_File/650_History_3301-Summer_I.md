Dr. Anson
Summer, 2000  
_Office:_ Stabler Hall 606C  
_Hours:_ 8:00-8:30 a.m., MWF, and by appointment (call 569-3235; e-mail

####  History 3301 is a survey course of the social, intellectual, and
cultural history of ancient Western civilization.

**  _Required Reading_ :**  
The following are the texts required for this course. They are available in
the bookstore.  
    
  _The Epic of Gilgamesh_ (Penguin)  
[_Bible_ (can use RSV or King James - some Oxford Annotated Bibles available
in bookstore)](http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?version=RSV&passage=all)

(NAL)](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/Texts/chunk_TOC.html#Plato)  
_Letters from a Stoic_ (Penguin)  
_[](http://www.shef.ac.uk/uni/projects/gpp/Tapestry/religion/theegy1.html)_

**_Requirements for the Course_**  
    There will be two examinations, a midterm and a cumulative final. Both will consist of a first section devoted to identifications about which the students will write a brief paragraph. The second portion will be devoted to one or more essay questions. In addition to the examinations, four short papers (2-6 pages typed or equivalent in clear handwriting) are required during the course of the semester from six possible topics. These papers are to be entirely based on particular reading assignments in the required reading. Students are permitted one rewrite for each of their four papers. Papers should be entirely based on the assigned primary reading; all statements of fact must be accompanied by in text page references.   


####    ** _Grades will be computed on the following basis:_**

####  20% Midterm

####  60% Papers (15% for each paper)

####  20% Final (or 40% if the midterm is dropped; see below)





**_General Information_**

 No make-up exams will be given during the semester. Since the final is
cumulative, those who miss the midterm will have their final weighted
accordingly. Papers are to be turned in on or before their due dates as noted
in the syllabus. Papers may, however, be rewritten once and resubmitted for
evaluation. Higher grade will be the one finally recorded.  No incompletes
will be given unless approved by me _prior_ to July 5, 2000.    Moreover,
incompletes will only be given when circumstances beyond the control of the
student  prevent the student from completing _part_ of the course
requirements.   Incomplete cannot be given for the entire semester's work.
Moreover, all completed work counts; an incomplete is not a substitute for a
failing grade.  Finally, History 3301 may not be taken on a credit/no credit
basis, or pass/fail basis.

**_Class Attendance_ :** **_Class attendance is required_** ; the student is
held responsible for all reading assignments and for all material covered and
announcements made in class. Everyone is expected to be present at the time
class starts and remain until it is dismissed. If for great and good cause you
are either late or have to leave early, please enter or leave quietly and as
inconspicuously as possible.

**_DISABILITY SUPPORT SERVICES_** \- It is the policy of UALR to accommodate
students with disabilities, pursuant to federal law, state law, and the
University's commitment to equal educational opportunities. Any student with a
disability who needs accommodation, for example in seating placement or in
arrangements for examinations, should inform the instructor at the beginning
of the course. The Chair of the Department offering this course is also
available to assist with accommodations. Students with disabilities are also
encouraged to contact the Office of Disability Support Services, which is
located in the Donaghey Student Union, Room 105, telephone 569-3143.

  ** _CHEATING_** \- No student may gain undue advantage over his/her
classmates by deceptive or dishonest means (as defined in "Cheating", Student
Handbook, p. 30). Anyone who engages in such activity will receive an "F" in
the course and will be turned over to the Academic Integrity and Grievance
Committee for University disciplinary action.

  ** _GRADING QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS_** \- Students with questions or
complaints about the grading of their papers or exams should write out what
the problem is and hand it in after class. This is the forum in which such
matters are to be handled, not during class, nor during office hours.

All grade computations are on the following basis:  
  90-100% = A | 70-79% = C  
---|---  
80-89% = B | 60-69% = D  
80-89% = B | 0-59% = F  
*(Papers turned in the first time and earning a grade below 70% must be redone)*

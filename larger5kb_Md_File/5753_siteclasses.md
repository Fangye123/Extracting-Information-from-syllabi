Meeting Times: MW 8:30-9:45 am  
Room: N1B85  
Instructor: Kwasi Ampene  
Office: N 134

Office Hours: Weds 3-4 pm, Thurs 1-2:00 pm , or by appointment.

**Objectives**  
The objectives of the course are (1) To present historical facts about jazz
and the sociology from which it developed; (2) To create an awareness of
styles and forms which characterize major periods in the history of jazz; (3)
To develop an understanding of how the music was and is performed through a
study of various performers and composers, and (4) to embark on a general
survey of jazz literature.   In addition, there course will examine special
theoretical topics that are educationally engaging and intellectually
stimulating.

**Required Text & Readings**  
Gunther Schuller, 1989. The Swing Era, New York: Oxford University Press.
Readings from this text and  numerous readings from different sources will be
assigned.  Most of the readings will be reviewed by students and presented
orally in class; other readings will be assigned as background material for
general discussions.  Reviews will be assigned during class meetings and
presented the following class time.

**Course Requirements**  
You are required to participate in all class discussions and activities-this
means completing any reading and/or writing assignments on time (in most cases
by the following meeting) and to come to meetings with questions and comments
related to your assignments and/or readings.  You will also be asked to
propose, prepare, and complete a final research project related to one or more
of the themes discussed in class or a topic of your own choice with my
approval. The project will result in both an oral presentation and a
professional quality manuscript, described in greater detail below.  Your
final grade will be a combination of class participation (20%), written
reviews (50%), and a final research paper (40%).

**Reviews**  
The quality of written communication is part of the evaluation for each
writing assignment. Your essays must be carefully edited for typos and
grammatical errors; they should appear clean and neat.  Reviews must be typed
on white paper using standard typeface (please, no script or fancy typeface).
Use one-inch margins around the text. If you cite published sources, you must
include a bibliography.  If your paper does not conform to these
specifications, it will be considered unfinished and returned to you without a
grade.

**Final Paper and Final Presentation**  
Your research project should result in an extended written essay as well as a
twenty-minute oral presentation.  Both should be based on thoughtful,
interpretive research that addresses some of the issues raised in class.  The
essay should be well-written, as if it were being submitted to a professional
journal (and perhaps it could be).  The oral presentation can be similarly
organized but should perhaps focus more on the results of your analysis since
you are limited to twenty minutes.  You will give your oral presentation in a
mock conference setting to be held during the three class meeting of the
semester (during exam week).  You are free to choose any topic for your
research project, although I reserve the right to reject any proposal I feel
is inappropriate.  The project may either examine a particular music
(event/performance/tradition/genre) or be theoretically/conceptually oriented.
Note in the course schedule below that you are required to submit a proposal
on March 5th for approval before beginning your project.

You may also consult with me anytime during the semester.  If you wish, your
project can also be directly or indirectly related to your thesis or
dissertation work. You are also encouraged to consult with one another as you
work on your exercises and final projects but I do expect your work to be your
own.

Your written essay as well as all your written assignments should be of
professional quality.  In other words, it must be thoughtfully written and
carefully typed and edited for typos and grammatical errors.  If you have
writing problems, you are encouraged to consult with the Writing Center for
help. Or you can meet with me during office hours or by appointment if you
have any questions or problems.

**Code of Conduct**  
I expect all of you to conduct yourself professionally during discussions and
respect the views of your colleagues no matter how much you might disagree.
Further, you will be evaluated not on whether you agree with my own views but
on how well you present and develop your thesis.  Needless to say,
professional conduct also includes attending the class regularly, doing the
work on time, and participating in discussions.

You are encouraged to consult with one another outside of the class as you
work through your readings, reviews, and final projects.  There is nothing
ethically wrong with discussing the readings or your own work with other
members of the class.  This can generate new ideas or help you understand some
of the more difficult topics we might cover.  Having said all that, however, I
do expect your writing to be your own.  Even collaborative projects should
generate unique papers by members of such teams.

Top **GOALS: ENCOUNTERING HISTORY**

    This writing intensive course serves as an introduction to American History at the college level. The purpose of the course is to enable you to use texts, documents, and secondary readings to understand the life experiences of ordinary people from different races and cultures and, to improve your ability to write analytically. We will explore how material conditions, that is, the environment, production and consumption of goods, and use of social space interacted with religious, political, and interpersonal beliefs to shape experience. Our goal is to arrive at an understanding of why and how life in the past differed from region to region and changed over time in the United States up to 1865.

    In addition we will examine the "construction" of history in three ways: one, by developing our own interpretations of primary sources; two, by discussing important and sometimes conflicting secondary works; third, by evaluating primary documents on the World Wide Web.  In these ways, we can begin to see that history is an interpretation of the past shaped by the concerns of the present.

Top **REQUIREMENTS**

_Class Preparation **:**_

The most important requirement for this course is a careful reading of the
assignments and thoughtful participation in class discussion and group
exercises. The assigned reading must be done before coming to class. To
prepare for class participation, the student should take notes on the reading
and develop questions for class discussion.  A Reading Analysis assignment
(indicated on the class schedule) is required for several of the chapters and
is due at the first class for each Topic.  The assignments can be found on the
Course WebPage. It is each student's responsibility to get the assignment even
if absent from class and to complete it on time. Late assignments will not be
accepted, however, each student may omit one of the Reading Analysis
assignments without penalty. There will be one mid-term exam and one final
exam. Attendance is required and more than two absences will adversely affect
your grade. Always bring **both** books and your notes to class with you.

Top _Final Project:_

The final project is based on group work that will utilize primary and
secondary sources and the understanding of developments in American history
gained during the course to create a biography or community study of a real or
imaginary historical figure or place that will be presented in class. The
final project can take the form of a play, video, or a web page linked to the
Course web site if approved by Dr. Hunter well in advance. Detailed
instructions will be provided later in the semester.

Text: _Biology: The Unity and Diversity of Life_ , 9th ed., Starr & Taggart,
(C) 2001\. Web sites: <http://www.brookscole.com/biology>;

This course is an introduction to the science of biology, fulfilling 4 hours
of the Natural Sciences (with lab) GEC Subject Area Requirement. We will cover
cell biology, metabolism, genetics, biochemistry, evolution, and biotechnology
(at least briefly). The terminology of biology, the scientific method, and the
critical analysis of data will be stressed throughout the course. Successful
students will demonstrate: a breadth of knowledge in natural sciences, the
beginnings of a depth of knowledge in biology, an ability to write clearly,
read with comprehension, and listen with care, and the ability to think
critically and reflectively and draw reasonable, supportable conclusions
(Institutional Goals, p. 5 of the TLU Catalog).  
  
NOTE: T.L.U. seeks to provide reasonable accommodations for all qualified
individuals with disabilities. If you require some special arrangement in
order to meet course requirements, it is your responsibility to register with
the Office of the Dean of Student Life, and to contact the instructor as soon
as possible so that necessary accommodations may be made (see pp. 154-156 of
the TLU Catalog).  
  
Grades: The grade you receive in this class is based on the following:  
  5 Lecture Exams (60 pts. each) = 300 pts. To see a [sample exam, click
here](143%20exam1.PRN.html).  
Assignments, Pop Quizzes = 50 pts.  
Portfolio = 100 pts.  
Lab = 150 pts.  
Total = 600 points  
  
Your final course grade will be determined by the percentage of the 600 points
you earn.  
Attendance is required for lecture and lab. You will be dropped with a failing
grade if you miss more than one (1) lab. You must have a legitimate excuse in
order to attend lab on an alternate day.  
  
To encourage you to read the text **before class** , quizzes covering **that
day's** reading assignment will be given at the beginning of most lectures.
There will be no make-up quizzes-come to class **on time** . Lecture tests
will be made up of 50% multiple choice/true or false/matching type questions,
and 50% short essay questions. Make-up exams (a different [m.c.] test) will be
given **during Finals Period**. Students will have the opportunity to retake a
(different) test during finals, if they have no make-up tests to take. Grades
from retakes will be averaged with the original grade received for the test.  
The Portfolio will be an opportunity for you to personalize this course,
concentrating on items you may be most interested in. It should include essays
dealing with the theme of Unity and Diversity of Life. On reserve in the
library, you will find many articles on various subjects. You may write essays
summarizing those articles and explaining how they relate to the theme. You
may find other articles or web sites dealing with the theme. Include a
complete citation for these articles. You may include other types of work in
your portfolio. This is a chance to impress me with your understanding of
biology. I am impressed with well-written essays. 5-6 good essays will be
considered an A portfolio (quantity does not substitute for quality). You may
work in pairs with another student from my section on this project. Portfolios
will be due in class on Nov. 19. Late work will be penalized 2% per day.  
  
As stated in the Student Handbook (sec. V.c.), any cases of cheating or
plagiarism will result in an F grade.

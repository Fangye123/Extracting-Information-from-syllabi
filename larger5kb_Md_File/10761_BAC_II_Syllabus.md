**OVERVIEW OF BAC II COURSE COMPONENTS**  
  
**A. BAC II Humanities in Medicine Block**  
The purpose of BAC II Humanities in Medicine Block is to expose students to a
wide variety of social issues in medicine addressed from various humanities
perspectives including literature, history, law, religion, ethics, trans-
cultural issues, and the arts. Classes will be conducted seminar-style.  
  
**B. BAC II Introduction to Internal Medicine Block**  
The BAC II Introduction to Internal Medicine Block will provide a multi-
disciplinary survey of Internal Medicine presented with emphasis on the
pathophysiology and clinical presentation of common medical disorders in the
adult patient. Didactic lectures, small groups (problem-based and case-based
learning) and patient interactions are utilized in this block.  
  
**C. BAC II Introduction to Obstetrics and Gynecology Block**  
The BAC II Introduction to Obstetrics and Gynecology Block will provide
information in regard to normal obstetrics and gynecology. This will serve as
a foundation for the third year of medical school which is really a continuum
of this block. This block will be one of the students first exposures to
clinical medicine; clinical skills will be taught. Students will learn not
only core information in obstetrics and gynecology, but the mechanics of
medicine including problem solving and developing a differential diagnosis.
The block will include large group lecture and small group case study
discussions.  
  
**D. BAC II Introduction to Pediatrics Block**  
The BAC II Introduction to Pediatrics Block is designed to provide each
student with an introduction to the most common aspects of pediatric medicine;
to acquaint the student with the pediatric approach to both health maintenance
and some of the more common pediatric disease processes; to prepare students
for clinical rotations in the second year preceptorship; to prepare students
for third and fourth year clerkships; and to foster a life-long general
interest in the area of pediatrics. The BAC II Introduction to Pediatrics
Block will utilize a dynamic interactive case-oriented teaching format
incorporating clinical vignettes, x-rays, lab values, and photographs of
actual patients.  
  
**E. BAC II Clinical Preceptorship in Primary Care Medicine Block**  
Each student will complete at least two rotations in Family Practice and one
rotation in Internal Medicine. Some, but not all, students will have one
rotation in Pediatrics and all students will complete at least five elective
rotations. Family Medicine and Internal Medicine rotations are five weeks in
length. The electives from which the students may choose are Allergy,
Cardiology, Dermatology, Emergency Medicine, Gastroenterology, Genetics,
Obstetrics/Gynecology, Occupational/Rehabilitative Medicine, Ophthalmology,
Orthopedics, Otorhinolaryngology, Radiology, Surgery, Urology, or working in
the Prenatal Clinic. Students typically see patients with their preceptor,
gradually assuming greater involvement with patients as they gain new skills
and knowledge in the medical school curriculum. At the conclusion of each
rotation of family practice,  
internal medicine, and pediatrics, the student will be evaluated on his or her
ability to interact with patients and conduct a history and physical
examination.  
The workshop sessions include: History and Physical Examination, History and
Physical of a Newborn, Genitourinary, Female Pelvic, Evidence-based Medicine,
MEDLINE Assessment (optional), and a Safety Orientation by St. Joseph
Hospital.  
  
**F. BAC II Introduction to Clinical Psychiatry Block**  
The goal of the BAC II Introduction to Clinical Psychiatry Block is to provide
students with a solid base of knowledge about psychiatric disorders, including
central aspects of diagnosis and treatment. Psychiatric disorders are seen in
all types of medical settings, and skill in recognizing and managing them is
essential in every medical specialty. Students will use the information
learned in this block in the third year rotation in Psychiatry and throughout
their medical careers. Didactic lectures and patient interaction are utilized
in this block.

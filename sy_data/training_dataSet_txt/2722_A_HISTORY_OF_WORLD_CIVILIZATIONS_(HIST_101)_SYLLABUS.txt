B. COURSE OBJECTIVES

1. To acquaint students with the main developments in the major civilizations of the world from their beginnings to the fifteenth century. (Readings from political, philosophical and religious writing will supplement the textbook and provide practical examples of how some people have dealt with the perennial problems facing humankind.)
2. To draw attention to the main characteristics of the major world civilizations--in areas of culture such as art, philosophy, religion, and government--and the factors which contributed to their uniqueness.
3. To address some of the perennial questions humankind has asked and analyze the implications of the answers to these questions.
4. To acquaint students with the way historians work, the importance of the methodologies used, how these methodologies are similar and different to other disciplines in the social sciences, and ways in which the telling or writing of history is affected by the approaches and methods historians use.
5. To develop the following skills: 

a. The ability to gather information efficiently and critically; 
b. The ability to think critically about what is heard or read; 
c. The ability to form judgments which are consistent with the evidence; 
d. The ability to communicate those judgments clearly and cogently in spoken and written form.
C. METHODS
1. Lectures and/or discussions, normally four times a week.
2. Reading and note-making by the student: Lectures are a guide to, rather than an exhaustive analysis of, a topic. Wide and intelligent reading is necessary if the student is to be well-informed.
3. Tests and Quizzes: These will give students an opportunity to see how well they are meeting the course objectives.
4. Essays: These will allow the student to analyze and discuss specific topics or questions in a more detailed manner.
5. Final examination: A final demonstration of the student's progress.
D. REQUIREMENTS
1. Reading: You should aim to spend at least six hours each week reading and making notes. Some of this time should be spent reading the books mentioned in the next section. 
2. Tests: lasting one hour on October 23 and November 17 (worth 20% of the grade).
3. Quizzes, usually given on a Friday (worth 10% of the grade).   The quizzes will be taken in groups.Rules: the members of the groups should remain the same for the whole quarter; the group may discuss the answers to the quiz question and come to a consensus but each individual is responsible for his or her own answers; students who 'coast' -- i.e. do no prepare for the quiz and rely on the other members of the group -- will have the score for the particular quiz discounted.
4. Primary Source Reading: Seven times during the quarter 'problems' in history based on primary texts--mainly from the books Sources of World History, Volume 1 and Discovering the Global Past, Volume 1--will be discussed in class. Essays will be set based on the class discussion and the reading. (Worth 30% of the grade.)
5. Final Examination: Monday, December 10, 9:45-11:45
 REQUIRED READING
Albert M. Craig et al., The Heritage of World Civilizations, 5th edition, Macmillan. Cited below as 'Craig' 
Mark A Kishlansky, Sources of World History, 2d edition, Volume 1, West. Cited below as 'Kishlansky'
Merry E. Wiesner et al., Discovering the Global Past, Volume 1, Houghton Mifflin. Cited below as 'Wiesner'
F. GRADING
Students may choose to have their grade calculated in either of the following ways: 


1.


Best Three Essays

30%


Best Two Quizzes

10%

20%


Final Examination

40%


 
2. Solely on the basis of the final examination (provided all course work is completed). 
Students should note that essays may not be handed in late nor the test or examination taken at an alternative time without a valid excuse; no form of cheating will be excused either.  The penalty for lateness is a 25% reduction of the grade given; cheating will result in an 'F' for the particular assignment (and, possibly, the whole course).

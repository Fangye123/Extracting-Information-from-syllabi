Course Syllabus - HS 042  
Modern History II

> **Course Description:  
>  ** This course is the second part of the two-semester History Core. It is
designed for students who have completed the first half of the Core. The
course is a one-semester survey of the key developments in European and
American history from the nineteenth century to the present. While text
readings will shed light on politics and foreign policy, in class discussion
an attempt will be made to focus on social developments and real people's
experiences -- that means women and men like you and me. In addition, students
will become familiar with different perspectives and approaches to writing
history.

>  Assignments will be handed out approximately ten days before the due date.
Students are encouraged to discuss their papers with Ed and me and to have
someone look over their rough drafts. Papers are due at the beginning of the
class period. We will not accept late submissions, OCF-related delays,
negligent roommates, or other excuses.  
>  
>  **Discussion and Attendance:** 30% of Grade  
>  **  
> Discussion:**  
>  Students are expected to contribute regularly and significantly to weekly
class discussions. A discussion grade will be assigned based on students'
performance at these weekly sessions. Although regular and active
participation is expected, students who fail to read the assignment and try to
"fake" discussion will not be given any more credit than other students that
are not prepared.  
>  **  
> Attendance:**  
>  Attendance will be taken at every class meeting and each Friday discussion.
Woody Allen is credited with coining the expression,  "95% of life is showing
up." With Allen's wisdom in mind, students will be given a grade for their
attendance to class meetings and discussion. This attendance grade will be
figured in the following manner:   |  0-2 absenses  
>  3-4 absenses  
>  5-6 absenses  
>  7+ absenses |  A  
>  B  
>  C  
>  **F** |  
> ---|---|---|---  
>  
>  
>  Ed and I reserve the following discretionary rights: (1) to decide whether
to admit students who enter the classroom late, (2) whether or not to count
late arrivals as absenses, and (3) to excuse an absense due to a family or
personal emergency.  
>  
>  **Journal:** 15% of Grade  
>  
>  Students will be expected to keep a journal of their reactions to the
discussion readings. These journal entries are brief personal responses to the
weekly reading assignments that students should bring with them to class each
Friday, along with the reading assignment for the week. Journals will be
collected from each student once or twice during the semester. Each week in
discussion, we will collect several journals from students chosen at random.
**No advance warning will be given before the journals are collected. No make-
ups will be given to students who come to class without journals or who fail
to show up to discussion.**  
>  I recommend students keep journals in the black and white  "Composition"
books that can be purchased at the bookstore.  
>  Students should write short reactions (ie. two or three paragraphs) to the
weekly discussion readings.  
>  There is no need to type these entries, but please write in ink in a clear,
legible manner.  
>  
>  **Movies:**  
>  In the course of the semester, the following movies will be shown to
correspond with topics discussed in class. Students will be given further
information on the exact time and place of the movies when class begins.
Students are expected to attend at least two of these screenings.  
>  
>  During the week of... Movie  
>  
>  February 9 Birth of a Nation  
>  March 9 Europa, Europa  
>  March 30 Dr. Strangelove  
>  
>  These movies will be on hold in the media center of the library during the
week that the class is scheduled to view them for students who are unable to
attend.  
>

>

> **Examinations:**  
>  Midterm/Final ID's: 25% of Grade:  
>  
>  Exams will be given in class. Students will complete a fifty minute midterm
on February 27. The midterm will consist of identifications and a map quiz.
Students will complete a final exam on April 29 consisting of identifications.

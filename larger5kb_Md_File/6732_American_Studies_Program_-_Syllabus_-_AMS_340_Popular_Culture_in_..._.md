This Section of the American Studies Symposium examines popular culture and
the emergence of mass culture in the United States over the last 100 years or
so. It starts from the premise that popular culture, far from being a
frivolous or debased alternative to high culture, is an important site of
popular expression and cultural conflict, and deserves critical attention.
Thus we examine theoretical texts that help us to "read" popular culture, even
as we study specific forms and artifacts of popular culture: from television
shows to Hollywood movies, the pornography industry to spectator sports, and
popular music to theme parks. Throughout the course, we ground what we call
"culture" in political, economic, and social contexts.

       _Format_ : This is a discussion symposium. You are expected to complete the assigned readings on time and to participate in classroom discussions. In addition you must keep an intellectual journal of your responses to the readings during the first eight weeks of the semester (to be turned in at the end of each class). The primary assignment will be to write a 15-page research paper on a topic that relates to the themes of the symposium. 

       _Evaluations_ : You will be evaluated on the basis of the research paper (worth 40% of the grade), a bibliographic essay (10%), an oral presentation on your paper (10%), your journal (20%), and class participation (20%). You will be graded down for missing classes.

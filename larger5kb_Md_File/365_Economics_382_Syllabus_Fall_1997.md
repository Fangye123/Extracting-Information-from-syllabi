**Course Overview:  **

This course focuses on the development of economic theories from the 15th
century to the present (although some attention is given to ancient epochs).
This is an important course in economics because it enhances the understanding
of modern economic theory as well as contemporary economic policy. The
historical context, personalities, and controversies surrounding the evolution
of economic ideas are developed to provide a better understanding of the
social problems economists have addressed, the models and methods they have
used, and the intellectual debates that have been carried on between different
eras of economists.  

For economics majors, this course should enhance your ability and desire to
critically examine the principles you are learning to apply. Non-majors will
gain a better understanding where the ideas of economics came from and how
they are used. Whether you are interested in becoming a better practicing
economist or are interested in the history of ideas this course should be
beneficial to your curriculum.

**Office Hours:**  

The following times have been reserved specifically for meeting with students:
**MWF 9:15-10:15** and **TTH 2:00-3:00.** I encourage you to call me at my
office(289-8566) and arrange a time to meet with me if these hours are not
compatible with your schedule.  

**Attendance:  **

Students are expected to be diligent in their pursuit of their studies and
regular in their class attendance. Students have the responsibility of making
arrangements satisfactory with me regarding absences. Policies of making up
work missed as a result of an absence are at my discretion. Attending class is
a choice that you make, along with the degree of participation in class.
College is a place of learning and learning can be either active or passive.
You should participate in class and you are expected to contribute to the
assignment of the day. Like exams and quizzes, attendance is "priced" to
provide the incentive for you to attend class and be an active learner.
_Regardless_ of the reason (official or unofficial business) you are **limited
to three free class absences**. Any additional two absences (or any fraction
thereof) costs a letter grade per time. If there is a problem see me during
the first week of class. Also, if a problem arises during the semester, please
see me. Students enrolled in School of Business courses must attend at least
75 percent of the meetings of a course to be eligible to receive credit in the
course.

**Course Requirements and Grading:**  

Grading in this course is based on a ten point scale. General requirements for
a letter grade are as follows:

A-(90+) Outstanding achievement, given to a relatively small number of
excellent scholars  
B-(80+) Good achievement, everyone attending the University of Richmond is
capable of this level of work  
C-(70+) Average achievement, generally reflects a lack of serious effort in
the course  
D-(60+) Poor, but passing work  
F-(below 60) Failure, given for unsatisfactory work, no credit is awarded

There will be two major exams for this course; one roughly in the middle of
the semester and one at the end of the semester (see schedule). Each major
exam will count 30%. The final will not cover 2000 years of economic thought.
Twenty percent (20%) of your grade will be based on a number of quizzes which
will be taken in class (they will usually be announced). The final twenty
percent (20%) will be determined by your participation and attendance in class
; a short paper on a major economist which you will present in class; and an
in class presentation of a APast as Prologue@ selection from the primary text.
Guidelines for the presentations are forthcoming.

All work in this course will be completed in accordance with the **Honor
Code.** Students must familiarize themselves with the Honor Code. Academic
dishonesty will not be tolerated. Copying during an examination, using
unauthorized materials during an exam, obtaining information about an exam
prior to the exam, using the services of term paper assistance companies is a
violation of university policies and academic integrity. Any violation of
these or other provisions of the honor code will automatically result in
punitive action by me and in all probability a referral to the appropriate
Honor Council.

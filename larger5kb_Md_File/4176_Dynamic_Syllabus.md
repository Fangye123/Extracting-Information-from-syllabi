**Course Description**

This seminar employs a thematic approach in its survey of spirituality and
religious lives in the United States in the period after the Civil War to the
present. Without any pretensions to being comprehensive, the course is
constructed around the following themes: encounters; religion, race, and
American identities; gender; religion and consumer economies; science and
technology; and the fundamentalist quest for a Christian America.

**Course Objectives**

The course has the following four objectives:

1) to introduce you to some of the people, practices, ideas, and institutions
that have contributed to the formation of a rich and varied landscape of
religious expression in the United States.

2) to enhance your ability to read and understand both primary texts produced
by historical figures and interpretive scholarly literature.

3) to help you sharpen your skills as an interpreter of religious life in the
United States.

4) to give you some experience in using the World Wide Web as tool for
academic study, and (for TS students at least) as a communications medium for
ministry.  


**Requirements**  


  * Attendance, participation, and careful reading are matters to take very seriously. They are key ingredients for the successful completion of the seminar. That means arriving on time and being fully prepared. Unexcused absences and excessive tardiness will earn an invitation to withdraw from the course.
  


  * Each week I will ask for volunteers to comment on the next week's reading \- one person per article, teams of two whenever a book is assigned. You must each submit a 1-2 page write-up of that particular reading, which should include a one-paragraph precis, a list of themes, and a brief outline and clear statement of the author's argument. In closing, develop one well-formed question that arises out of your reading. (Note: two pages is the absolute maximum!) These are graded Excellent/Sat/Unsat.
  


  * Work on the production of a course website, including the contribution of a primary text, images, annotated bibliography, links, and other material related to one of the course's themes.
  


  * For TS students, a mid-term take-home exam (10-12 page maximum) due on April.7.
  


  * For TS students, an oral final examination due during exam period. (Guidelines and sample questions will be posted on dynamic syllabus.)
  


  * For GS students, the production of a semester-long analytic and interpretive research project related to one of the course's themes. Particular topic to be chosen in consultation with instructor. The project includes 3 components: 1) submission of a 10-12 page first draft by April 14; 2) an oral presentation; and 3) the submission of a 20-25 page final draft due no later than May 10th. (Further guidelines to be posted on the dynamic syllabus.)

**Evaluations**

In a perfect world, there would be no grades. However, since we live this side
of paradise, not the following:

For TS students, your final grade will be calculated with these weights in
mind:

    Midterm exam = 30%   
    Work on course website = 25%   
    Brief assignments and participation = 15%   
    Final exam = 30% 

For GS students, your final grade will be calculated with these weights in
mind:

    Work on course website = 20%   
    First draft = 25%   
    Oral presentation, brief assignments and participation = 15%   
    Final draft = 40% 

Note: I expect you to complete all assignments on time unless you inform me of
a bona fide emergency. I will not grant the grade of Inc. (Incomplete) except
in extreme circumstances, and only then after the proper authority from your
Dean's office.

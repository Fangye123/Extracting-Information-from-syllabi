[ROSEMARY JANN](mailto:rjann@gmu.edu) is a Professor of English and also
teaches in the Cultural Studies program. Her main area of expertise is
nineteenth-century England, and she teaches a range of Victorian prose,
poetry, and fiction, in addition to various courses in literary analysis and
scholarship required of undergraduate and graduate students. As a scholar, her
first book ( _The Art and Science of Victorian History_ , 1985) examined
Victorian historical writing for the ways its literary strategies enabled
historians to negotiate the intellectual and moral dilemmas characteristic of
their age. More recently she has shifted her focus to the assumptions behind
and roles played by appeals to scientific authority in later Victorian
England. Recent articles like "Sherlock Holmes Codes the Social Body" ( _ELH_
1990) and  "Darwin and the Anthropologists: Sexual Selection and Its
Discontents" ( _Victorian Studies_ 1994) are representative of her interest in
how texts ranging from popular literature to scientific theory work to
construct ideological assumptions about social difference. Her more recent
book, _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: Detecting Social Order_ (1995), is
aimed at teaching a student audience how to read popular literature for its
ideological as well as literary messages.

reflect an interdisciplinary approach to the study of American culture. The
primary focus is upon American literature and its relations to political and
religious contexts. Kuebrich's scholarship on Whitman has explicated the
religious dimensions of Whitman's poetry while placing the author within the
context of antebellum American religion. Subsequent work on Melville, Mary
Gordon and Tim O'Brien emphasizes the religious and political dimensions of
their texts. Kuebrich is also working on a study of recent American religion
and politics.

a J.D. candidate at the George Mason School of Law. His list of publications

written a novel set in Rural Kentucky. Mr. McCarthy's specific interest in
Composition Studies is the liberal hegemony that has grown up around the
teaching of writing. He is interested, for instance, in whether teaching
process has relevance to the training of writers and thinkers; in the
appropriate role of theory in the classroom; and in the canonization of essays
in composition anthologies.

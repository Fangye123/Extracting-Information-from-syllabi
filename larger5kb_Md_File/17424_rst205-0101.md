[Religious Studies](rst.htm) is an academic discipline in which the
[phenomenon of religion](studyreligion.htm) in human experience is studied in
a  
nonsectarian, unbiased manner using various kinds of historical-critical,
analytical, comparative, phenomenological,  
interdisciplinary methodologies.  Discussion should be conducted with honesty,
enthusiasm, kindness, critical thought  
and respect for the worldviews and beliefs of others. This course is not only
for learning, but is itself to be a model for how  
to learn, why to learn, and to learn to love to learn.

**Course Description**  
This course is a correlation of religion with the different ares of life:
natural science, humanities, social sciences,  
philosophy, ethics, education.  We will explore the influences of the
following upon religion today:  science & technology,  
the privatization of religion, secularization, skepticism, religious disbelief
(agnosticism and atheism), religious pluralism.  
This study is a sustained reflection on the nature, role and meaning of
religion in the personal, cultural and universal  
aspects of human life and existence. Many [web resouce sites](resource.htm)
are available for this study and each student is responsible  
for using the sites.

Most of the course is an introduction to the major religions of the world:
**Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism,**  
**Christianity, Islam**.   The content of **primal religions** , such as
American Indian traditions, will also be viewed.  The  
problems, issues and dynamics of interreligious dialogue form an ongoing
contemplation in the course.  Such topics as  
God/Ultimate Reality, cosmology, evil, suffering and death, ethics, myth,
ritual, doctrine, freedom, love, mysticism,  
community, Afterlife, the sacred, etc. will be integrated into the discussion.

A feature of this course this semester will be an experience / experiment in
incultural dialogue and collaboration as  
learners in this RST 205 course communicate and collaborate with Japanese
students in a "Comparative Cultures" class  
at Kanzai University in Osaka, Japan.  This project will involved interculture
and interreligious discussions and writings  
with a [Kansai students web
site](http://www2.ipcku.kansai-u.ac.jp/~augustin/CompCult/CompCultIndex.html)
and a [Marshall students web site](Kansai-Marshall.htm).

A major focus in the study will be upon **interreligious dialogue** and
learners are encourage to reflect upon the theories  
and practices of such dialogue.  The following web sites are recommended to
you:

**Course Objectives**  
By the end of this study it is hoped and expected that each student will be
able to formulate a foundational understanding  
of the meaning and role of religion today.  Each student should gain an
introductory, but insightful, comprehension of the  
major world religions, as well as the problems and possibilities of
interreligious dialogue and the relationship between  
religion and contemporary science and culture.  This can all serve to
encourage students in their quest for meaning,  
understanding, compassion and wisdom.  
                                                                                                                                             Return to Top

**Computing in this Course**  
Each student needs to have the basic ability to use email that is web-
sensitive such as Netscape Messenger or Microsoft  
Outlook and to be able to find and utilize world-wide-web resources that are
available for the study of religion and religions  
through use of a web browser such as Navigator (4.0 or higher) or Internet
Explorer (4 or higher).  The course will include  
sending and receiving email, web site readings and research, an electronic
discussion list (with web archive) and electronic publication of student
writings, both individual and collaborative.

The educational use of telecomputing will facilitate ongoing asynchronous
discussion, submission and revision of student  
writings, peer review of student writings, collaborative group writings and
projects, individual communication with the  
professor, or among students, and publication of an electronic course journal
with student contributions.

[Telecomputing tutorials](telecomputing.htm) are available as is guidance on
how to [engage in respectful
communication](http://www.albion.com/netiquette/corerules.html) on the
Internet  
[(netiquette)](http://www.augsburg.edu/library/aib/mailmanners.html).  In
using web sources, please refer to [MLA Documentation of Electronic
Sources](http://valencia.cc.fl.us/lrcwest/mlaelectronic.html).

**_The purposes of the using of computer technology in this study are as
follows:_**

  *  Participation in the archived, asynchronous class discussion list (mailserv)
  * Communication with international, intercultural guests on the class list
  * Individual email contact with students from other parts of the world
  * Anytime communication of questions, comments, problems, etc. with the professor/mentor via individual email
  * Engage in a semester-long discussion with other learners in the course via the class discussion list
  * Submit individual & collaborative writings electronically to the class list or professor
  * Investigate relevant World-Wide Web sites
  * Collaborate with other students in the course on projects/writings via email
  * Expand opportunities for reflective participation in the study, beyond classroom time & place
  * Encourage learners/students to become more central to the learning process and more responsible for their                     own, and others', learning
  * Develop computer skills
  * Allow learning to become more enjoyable, valuable, enduring, self-directed, active and expansive beyond just a                transfer information from professor to student

**Writing Across the Curriculum**  
This study is a [Writing Across the Curriculum
(WAC)](http://www.marshall.edu/wac/), writing-intensive, course where writing
is fully integrated into all  
aspects of the learning and reflection process.  In this process one's writing
skills are further developed in the context of  
both learning to write and writing to learn. There are no exams in this
course, but there are in- and out-of-class writings,  
a formal, revised essay, group writings, oral presentations or debates with
written components.  On-line [writing resources](writingres.htm)  
are available.  All writings are to be completely the work of the individual
or the group doing the writing, thus avoiding  
all [plagiarism](http://www.indiana.edu/~wts/wts/plagiarism.html).  
                                                                                                                                             Return to Top

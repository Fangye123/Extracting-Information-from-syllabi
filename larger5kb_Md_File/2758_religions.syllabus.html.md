**[Professor Keller's home page](http://faculty.pittstate.edu/~ckeller/)**

**COURSE OBJECTIVE:** I strongly believe in and uphold the ethics of learner-
centered education. This means students are the primary agents of learning and
must take initiative as well as risks when entering unknown territory.
Education is about intellectual development; it has intrinsic moral value and
is not a "product" to be bought or consumed. Learning and teaching demand
courage because we confront new challenges and difficult situations. If we are
honest in our efforts, we will discover our strengths and weaknesses, and
ultimately this process will result in personal growth-our true goal. This
specific course is an introduction to some of the world's longest surviving
and most interesting religious and philosophical traditions. The discussions,
lectures, texts, and occasional video will provide students with an
opportunity to gain a fundamental understanding of the Asian religions and
philosophies introduced as well as basic knowledge of the developments that
occurred during the period covered. This course, like all Humanities, is
reading and writing intensive and will require students to take a very active
role in their education. The primary objective of the course is to help
students arrive at a personal understanding of some of Asia's important
religious and philosophical traditions. To achieve this goal, students will be
**expected** to develop and apply several important skills, resulting in these
**course outcomes** :

1\. Become familiar with a body of historical knowledge (content) through
reading, writing, and study.

2\. Think critically about and analyze historical forces that shaped the Asian
religions and philosophies covered, and that still influence the lives of over
two billion people today.

3\. Demonstrate an ability to discuss historical, religious, and philosophical
ideas and theories, and form arguments about their historical significance,
using clear oral and written communication.

**REQUIRED READING:** Please purchase the following books.

1\. Laurence Thompson, _Chinese Religion: An Introduction_ , 5th ed.(1996). (
**CR** )  
2\. H. Byron Earhart, _Japanese Religion: Unity and Diversity_ , 3rd
ed.(1982). ( **JR** )  
3\. Eugene Herrigel, _Zen in the Art of Archery_ , (1989).  
4\. Purchase at least 3 Exam Books in the Book Store, you need at least 1 for
each exam.

* * *

* * *

  
**EXAMINATIONS:** (Please refer to the COURSE SCHEDULE) There will be 2
Midterm Exams valued at 100 pts., and 1 Final Exam also valued at 100 pts.
Each exam covers the unit of the course that immediately precedes it. **There
will be no make-ups or early exams for the Final, except as allowed by the
Dean.** All exams will include material from the required readings, course
handouts, discussions, lectures, and videos, and will consist of short answer
questions, and essay answer questions. Buy **exam books** ("blue books") at
the Book Store and bring a new one to all exams; they cost twenty cents each.

**CRITICAL BOOK ESSAY:** One objective of this course is helping students
improve their analytical reading and writing skills, consequently, each
student is required to write one critical book essay (3-4 pages), typed and
double-spaced with regular margins. The essay is over Eugene Herrigel, _Zen in
the Art of Archery_ , valued at 100 pts., and **DUE FRIDAY, APRIL 19 TH**.
Essays will be accepted early and before 5:00 p.m. on the assigned day, **_BUT
LATE BOOK ESSAYS WILL BE PENALIZED 10 POINTS PER DAY LATE_** (an essay earning
85 points handed in after 5:00 on the due day but before 24 hours pass will be
given a 75). A few weeks after the semester begins, you will receive a format
guide to help you in writing the essay. **NOTE:** **I will gladly help you
with your essays if you ask me for help before you have to turn them in. This
includes reading your rough draft and providing comments on how you may
improve your essay.**  


**DISCUSSION DAYS AND IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS (QUIZZES):** Student-centered
learning requires that you actively participate in your education, thus
**Fridays the primary format of this course will be discussion.** This will
demand the participation of every student, and all students will be **expected
to prepare** for these classes. To facilitate this process, **every Friday
except Jan. 18 th and when exams are scheduled, **during the first 10-15
minutes of class there will be a written assignment (quiz) over the **required
weekly readings**. The format of these assignments will vary: mini-essays
about the content of the readings, identifications from the readings, a
paragraph on the significance of an event from the readings, multiple choice
questions, etc. There will be a total of 13 in-class assignments valued at 10
pts. each. The maximum total for the semester on these assignments will be 100
pts., which means there will be a 30 pt. "cushion" to allow for low scores on
a "bad day," for missed classes, and for **_Extra Points_**. The **required
weekly readings** will be the material from the text books as assigned on the
COURSE SCHEDULE, and/or course handouts I will give you, and/or internet
assignments you will have to access from a computer. If the **required weekly
readings** include course handouts or internet assignments, I will get these
to you as early as possible, but never later than the Monday before the Friday
we will be covering them. (The internet assignment for January 25 th is
already up on the **Course home page** ).

* * *

* * *

  
**COLLABORATIVE LEARNING GROUPS:** The remainder of the period on Fridays will
be a **Collaborative** **Discussion Class** that will cover the lecture
material and assigned readings for that week. Collaborative learning groups
will be formed randomly on the first discussion day of the semester, and each
week groups will address issues and questions from the readings and lectures
in writing (10 pts. each week). Each group will be responsible for ensuring
that each of its members makes a contribution to the work. Students will be
graded on their participation in the group discussions and contributions to
the writing assignments, **_and_** their participation in the general class
discussions that accompany the group work on the assigned days. The maximum
total for the semester on these assignments will be 100 pts., which means
there will be a 30 pt. "cushion" to allow for missed classes, and for **_Extra
Points_**. The goal of all the in-class work is to help you make slow, but
steady progress during the semester in achieving the course objectives
outlined above. **I will be looking for progress, not perfection. NO MAKEUPS
WILL BE ALLOWED FOR THE IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS OR THE COLLABORATIVE LEARNING
EXERCISES, NO EXCEPTIONS**.

**ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION, and MAKEUP POLICY:** Participation means in-class
speaking, in-class activities, and active, responsive listening. Participation
is a crucial element in this class. It includes in-class activities and
discussions. Simply showing up for class does not by itself constitute
participation. You are expected to present your informed ideas as well as to
listen and show respect for the others in the classroom. **Participation is
mental attendance in the course**. You will be graded on how much you
contribute to the learning environment of the class; if you do not add
anything to the class, then you will not receive a good participation grade.
This means several things: **(1)** not attending class physically will not
help your participation grade; **(2)** contributing to discussions can only
help your grade in this class; if you do not talk, then you are adding nothing
useful to the discussions; **(3)** simply repeating what the person before you
has said, with no new insights, does not add anything to the discussions;
**(4)** interrupting someone else, talking while others are talking, talking
during videos, sleeping, showing disrespect to others, showing up late to
class, etc., does not contribute to the class. Because this behavior is a
hindrance to other students' learning, it will be penalized. **Repeated
behavior that has a negative effect on the learning of the class will result
in dismissal from the class. Repeated tardiness** will negatively affect your
participation grade. You cannot fully participate in the class if you
frequently miss part of class sessions, and you are disrupting the flow of the
class as a whole when you come in late. Therefore, even if you actively
participate in class discussions when you are in class, your participation
grade will suffer if you are chronically late. Attendance will be recorded
daily. There will be **_no make-ups_** for the collaborative learning group
assignments or the in-class assignments (quizzes). Make-ups for the Midterm
exams will only be considered if I am given **_advance notice_** that you will
miss the exam, and provided with **_acceptable written documentation_**
explaining the emergency and why you missed the exam.

**COURSE EVALUATION:** Final semester grade calculation:

2 midterm exams X 100 pts. ea. = 200 pts.
A = 700-630  
1 final exam         X 100             = 100
B = 629-560  
1 book essay       X 100             = 100
C = 559-490  
 in-class writing assignments        = 100
D = 489-420  
 collaborative discussions            = 100  
 participation points                    = _100_  
                                                    700 

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:** Plagiarism or cheating of any kind, including cases of
two or more students submitting papers which are substantially the same in
content and language, will be prosecuted according to the University's
guidelines and could result in an F for the course or dismissal from the
University. Review page 36 in PSU, _2001-2003 University Catalog_ and be
absolutely sure you understand and comply with these guidelines.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Any student who has a disability that prevents the fullest
expression of abilities should contact me as soon as possible to discuss class
requirements and possible accommodations. Also see PSU, _2001-2003 University
Catalog_ , pg. 23-24. As instructor for this course, I reserve the right to
alter this syllabus if required; you will be notified in writing if this
occurs.

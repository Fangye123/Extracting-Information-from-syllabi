## Transferable Courses

  
  
**SCHOOLS NOT LISTED BELOW **

If a student is interested in taking a course from an accredited
University/College that is not listed below, a Transfer of Credit Form from
Student Services (completely fill out form) and a course description or
syllabus from the school must be obtained. **If the student is seeking a
course to transfer as MATH 201, MATH 202, MATH 242, MATH 243, MATH 302, or
MATH 349, computer component information MUST be included.** **The course
information and form should be taken to the Undergraduate Secretary in 301
Ewing [Monday thru Friday between 9:00-12:30 or 2:30-4:00] for evaluation.
This process takes 48 hours and the final decision on awarding credit rests
with the Associate Chair.**

  
  
|  **POLICY FOR MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES MAJORS **

Under extenuating circumstances beyond their control, Mathematical Sciences
majors may transfer, at most, two (2) upper-level mathematics courses before
finishing their Bachelor's degree. A student wishing to transfer credit for an
upper-level mathematics course (any course MATH 3** or above) must petition
the Associate Chair for permission. The student must provide a catalog
description and title of the textbook used. These must be comparable to the
University of Delaware course for which a substitution is being requested.
Only courses given by departments offering a Master's degree in Mathematics
qualify. Departments which offer only graduate degrees in Mathematics
Education do not qualify.

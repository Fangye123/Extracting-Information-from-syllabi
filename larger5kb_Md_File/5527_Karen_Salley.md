Required Text: Feldman, R. (1998). Social Psychology. Second Edition. Upper
Saddle  
River, NJ. Prentice-Hall, Inc.

Recommended: Study Guide to accompany text.

Course Prerequisite: Psy 101/201 and Psy 102/202 and Wr 121 and 122.

Course Description: The purpose of this course is to acquaint the student with
the important theories, principles and research within the realm of
traditional Social Psychology and to explore some contemporary social problems
as they are related to these issues. The topics that are covered in Psy 334
include theories, methods, social beliefs, cognitions and perceptions, the
self, prejudice and stereotypes, interpersonal attraction and close
relationships.

Course Requirements: The student will be expected to acquire an understanding
of the issues that are covered in the text and to be a participant in class
discussions and activities. Grades will be based upon two exams, chapter quiz
points, and topical paper presentations.

There will be two major exams during the term over the concepts covered in the
text. The tests will be multiple choice and short essay. A study guide for
these tests is available in the bookstore.  
120 points

Students will be expected to read the assigned chapter before each class
discussion. At the beginning of the class period there will be a brief, ten-
point quiz over the chapter. Anyone who has read the chapters should be able
to make 10 points on the quiz. In computing grades, the lowest quiz grade will
be dropped. Make-up quizzes will NOT be given.  
60 points

The class will be divided into three groups, I, II and III. On the assigned
dates the members of the groups are required to write and submit a topical
paper. The content of these papers should be related to issues in the chapter.
In general, the more the issue is discussed in terms of the concepts in the
chapter, the better the grade. These papers should be approximately 250-500
words in length and must be one of the following types:

1) Informative - a discussion of an issue that is related to the chapter but
not covered in depth. This could be information gathered from other texts,
books on the topic of psychology, or journal articles. For example, an article
on jealousy would be a good topic for the chapter on close relationships.. If
the paper is the informative type, you should cite the title and complete
reference for the article at the top of the first page.  
2) Experiential - a discussion of how concepts or issues in the chapter relate
to some past personal experience. For example, a report on your personal
experience with loneliness would be a good topic for the chapter on human
well-being.

3) Current events - an analysis of a report in the media of some social,
political or criminal happening in terms of concepts discussed in the chapter.
For example, the popularity of Princess Diana could be analyzed by
interpersonal attraction theories.

4) Practical - a discussion of methods in which some of the research, theories
or concepts should be used in real-life application. This could be an
application to solve some social problem or anticipated future application in
your work or personal life.

Several students will be selected at random during the class sessions to
present their papers to the class. Over the term all students will have an
equal chance of being called upon to present. The papers will all be submitted
each due date and points will be recorded for each paper. These papers must be
typewritten and must be headed in the following manner:

Your Name  
Your Group Number  
Chapter #  
Type of Paper  
Time of Class  
Date

Failure to identify your paper in this manner will result in it being handed
back to you ungraded.

Please staple your pages together and do not use a cover page.

NOTE: 1) The Psychology Department discourages late work, tardiness and
absenteeism. Make-up chapter quizzes will NOT be given. The midterm and final
can be made up only if the instructor is contacted prior to the test with a
legitimate excuse (to be determined by the instructor). Five points will be
deducted from each late paper.

2) Please do not bring visitors, children, or pets to class.

3) The instructor expects written work to be proofread and polished. Points
will be deducted for spelling and punctuation errors. Problem papers will be
returned for repair. Following is a list of words that are commonly misspelled
or misused:

psychology  
than/then  
separate  
there/their  
effect/affect  
occasion  
your/you're  
  
Also, please use apostrophes correctly.  
  
4) Students will be responsible for familiarizing themselves with student
rights and responsibilities as described in the Student Handbook.

5) The Psychology Department supports the use of language that is gender fair.
Please do not use male pronouns as generic. For example, use he/she or they
when speaking in general.

6) It is the policy of Southern Oregon University that discrimination on the
basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age,
marital status, or disability shall be prohibited. Neither will the University
tolerate sexual misconduct or sexual harassment by students, faculty, or

sexual misconduct have been violated, you are encouraged to contact the Dean
of Student Affairs Office, 552-6221.

Points for the evaluative aspects of the course will be approximately as
follows:

Test I (Midterm) 60  
Test II (Final) 60  
Chapter Quizzes 60  
Topical Papers 100 (2 papers, 50 points

Course Prerequisite: Psy 334 Social Psychology I

Course Description: This is the second half of the Social Psychology sequence.
The purpose of this course is to acquaint the student with the important
theories, principles and research within the realm of traditional Social
Psychology and to explore some contemporary social problems as they are
related to these issues. The topics that are covered in Psy 335 include group
processes, interpersonal attraction, close relationships, aggression,
altruism, and applied social psychology including law, health and conflict
issues.

Course Requirements: The student will be expected to acquire an understanding
of the issues that are covered in the text and to be a participant in class
discussions and activities. Grades will be based upon two exams, chapter quiz
points, and topical paper presentations.

1) Informative - a discussion of an issue that is related to the chapter but
not covered in depth. This could be information gathered from other texts,
books on the topic, journal articles, (Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology articles would be a good source), etc. For example, an article on
the stigma of unattractiveness would be a good topic for the chapter on
interpersonal attraction. Cite the complete reference for the article,
including author, date, journal or book, volume number and page number at the
top of the first page of the paper in the following manner:

Myer, C.B., and Taylor, S.E. (1986). Adjustment to rape. Journal of
Personality and  
Social Psychology, 50, 1226-1234.

Failure to do so will result in an incomplete on the paper.  
  
2) Experiential - a discussion of how concepts or issues in the chapter relate
to some past personal experience. For example, a report on your personal
experience of coming to the aid of accident victims would be a good topic for
the chapter on altruism.

3) Current events - an analysis of a report in the media of some social,
political or criminal happening in terms of concepts discussed in the chapter.
For example, a discussion of a recent murder case could be analyzed in terms
of what we know about eyewitnesses and juries.

4) Practical - a discussion of methods in which some of the research, theories
or concepts should be used in real-life application. This could be an
application to solve some social problem or anticipated future application in
your work or personal life.

Summer Term, Pre-Session, 1998 Karen Salley, Ph.D.  
**Psy 188 Human Sexuality CRN: 8645** Office: EP 204  
Classroom: EP 150 Phone: 552-6948

COURSE SYLLABUS

Required Text: Kelly, G., (1998). Sexuality Today. Boston: McGraw-Hill.  
  
Recommended Text: Study Guide to Accompany Text.

Course Objectives:

1\. To provide factual and practical knowledge about sexuality  
2\. To allow the students to explore their own values related to  
sexuality  
3\. To help students feel comfortable with their sexuality and the  
sexuality of others  
4\. To help students understand and accept variations in sexual lifestyles  
5\. To provide a basis for the student's developing constructive and  
rewarding relationships  
6\. To help students in dealing with and teaching about the sexuality  
of children.  
7\. To understand the psychological aspects of sexual problems and to  
feel comfortable asking for help in these areas

Course Expectations:

Students are expected to be active participants in the class. Attendance in  
small group sessions is required. Grades will be determined on the basis of  
the following criteria:

1\. Four quizzes (given daily Tuesday through Friday) which will be over
material covered by the assignment in the text. Quizzes must be taken on the
assigned date. There will be no make-up quizzes given. The quizzes will cover
the main points or highlights of each chapter.

(20 points per quiz) Total: 80 points

2\. Students will be required to write reaction papers to the films/videos.  
These papers should be one to two pages long and should focus on the  
student's reaction to the content presented. The following questions  
should be addressed in these papers.

a. What main points or events do I remember?  
b. What feelings did I have related to these points? Did I feel  
uncomfortable, angry, happy, disgusted, aroused, etc.?  
c. What conclusions or insights did I reach?  
d. Did the activity get me in touch with any conflicts or confusions  
that I have related to my sexual or emotional life?  
e. Were any of my former views or attitudes changed by the presentation? Do I
intend a behavior change?

These papers are worth ten points each. They will be due the class session
following the activity. Three points will be deducted for late papers.

Total: 80 points  
  
  
3\. The small group sessions are an integral part of the course. These
sessions are the situations which provide the student the opportunity to
become experientially and actively involved in the learning and growing
process. Grades will be assigned to each group member by the teaching
assistant (TA) for participation in the small group sessions. The sessions are
worth 10 points each.

Failure to attend these sessions will result in a loss of these  
points except in the event of medical or serious personal problems  
in which case the instructor should be contacted.

Total: 100 points

In the small group sessions it is imperative to remember the dignity of your
group members. It is right and good to disagree on issues, but people should
not judge others or put them down in any way. Everyone has the right to their
own beliefs and learning about others' view widens people's perspectives.

4\. In order to meet the college criterion for a 3 hour credit course,  
you are required to write a paper which is to be turned in after  
the end of the course. For this reason, the grade that will be  
assigned to you will be an incomplete until the paper is received  
and graded. The paper should be a typewritten research paper over  
some topic in the area of Human Sexuality in which you have a  
special interest. The last page of the paper should include a  
bibliography -- listing the books/articles used as references.  
Each listing should include author/date and source e.g., Smith, A. (1992).
Teen Sex. The Journal of Sexual Issues, Vol 3, 17-19. The exact nature of this
paper will be discussed in greater detail in class. The papers are due July
24.

Total: 50 points

From the above requirements, it can be seen that there are approximately 300  
points possible. Grades will be assigned on the basis of the following  
percentages of the total number of possible points:

A = 90% - 100%

B = 80% - 89%

C = 70% - 79%

D = 60% - 69%

F = below 60%

Office Hours:

I will be in my office the following times for consultation:

6/15 4 p.m. 7/9 4 p.m.  
6/16 4 p.m. 8/18 4 p.m.  
6/17 4 p.m. 8/19 4 p.m.  
6/18 4 p.m. 8/20 4 p.m.

Or you can reach me by phone (552-6948). If I am not in my office, leave a
message and I will return your call.Note:

1) The Psychology Department discourages late work, tardiness and absenteeism.
Make-up quizzes will not be given. Three points will be deducted for late
papers.

2) Please do not bring visitors, children or pets to class.

3) The Psychology Department discourages the use of sexist language. Please do
not use the male pronoun as generic (i.e., use "he/she" or "they" rather than
"he")

4) The instructor expects written work to be proofread and polished. Points
will be deducted for spelling and punctuation errors. Problem papers will be
returned for repair. Following is a list of words that are commonly misspelled
or misused:

psychology  
than/then  
separate  
there/their  
effect/affect  
occasion  
your/you're  
experiential  
Also, please use apostrophes correctly.

5) Students will be responsible for familiarizing themselves with student
rights and responsibilities as described in the Student Handbook.



INFORMED CONSENT: The course content (language, readings, lecture content,
discussions, audivisual materials) is often explicit in nature. You are
encouraged to withdraw from the course after the introductory class meeting if

Required Text: Santrock, John W. (1996). Adolescence (6th Ed.). Dubuque, Iowa:
Brown and Benchmark Publishers.

Course Prerequisites: General Psychology (101 and 102) and WR 121 and 122.

Course Requirements: The student will be expected to acquire an understanding
of the issues that are covered in the text and to be a participant in class
discussions and activities. Grades will be based upon weekly quizzes, reaction
papers, and movie reports.

Weekly quizzes over the reading assignment in Santrock will be given. These
quizzes will cover the highlights of the assignment and will be worth
approximately 20 points each. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped. NO
MAKEUPS WILL BE GIVEN.

The class will be divided into small groups. Each person in the group will be
responsible for reading and summarizing an article for their group. A reaction
paper to this article should be submitted for credit. Reaction papers should
be one page, double-spaced, typewritten, and should be a brief statement of
the student's personal response to the article with criticisms and
suggestions. Attached to it should be the article review (see form in
syllabus) completed in type. These papers will be worth 25 points each. (One
small group presentation and reaction paper per student.) The presenter should
make copies of the article review to distribute to each member of their small
group.

There will be three major movies shown during the term. You are required to
write a report on each movie which states the major points of issues of
adolescence and this course; e.g., describe how scenes in the movie exemplify
processes that are discussed in the text. Each paper will be worth 25 points
for a total of 75 points. They must be typewritten, double-spaced, and limited
to two pages.

Points for the course will be approximately as follows:

Total quiz points 140  
Reaction papers 25  
Movie reports 75  
Article review 25

TOTAL 265

Grades will be computed on the following point schedule:

A = 90-100%  
B = 80-89%  
C = 70-79%  
D = 60-69%

** Plus or Minus within a given grade category will reflect the best students
receiving a given grade (+) and the weakest students receiving a given grade
(-). These will be decided by the upper and lower ends of the point spread in
each category. In addition, both attendance and class participation will serve
as boosters within the plus/minus grading system.

Graduate students will be required to do a project, to be determined by the
graduate student in consultation with the instructor. This project will be
worth 100 points. The graduate projects must be completed for a passing grade
in the course.

NOTES:

1) The Psychology Department discourages late work, tardiness, and
absenteeism. Five points will be deducted from  
each late paper. Make-up quizzes will not be given. A missed test will count
as the lowest test grade and will be  
dropped.

2) PLEASE DO NOT BRING VISITORS, PETS, OR CHILDREN TO CLASS.

3) Students will be responsible for familiarizing themselves with student
rights and responsibilities as described in the Student Handbook.

4) The Psychology Department has adopted the use of non-gender specific
language. Thus, you must use pronounns that are not gender-specific (e.g., use
"he/she" or "they" rather than "he").

5) The instructor expects written work to be proofread and polished. Points
will be deducted for spelling and punctuation errors. Following is a list of
words that are commonly misspelled or misused that you should spell correctly
for full credit:

psychology separate effect/affect than/then there/their occasion

ALSO -- PLEASE USE APOSTROPHES WHEN APPROPRIATE.

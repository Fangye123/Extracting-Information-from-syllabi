principles |

At the conclusion of this course, students will be able to:

  1. Describe the basic concepts of biology, chemistry, and physics

|





Results of questions 1-11 and 28-40 of the comprehensive final examination  
  
2\. Thinking skills, such as analytical and critical interpretation,
integrative application of concepts to problem solving,
hypothetico-/deductive-/inductive reasoning, distinguishing fact and logical
inferences from judgment and opinion |

  * Analyze the inter-relationships among physical, biological, and chemical phenomena 
|

Results of questions 12-18, 49-60 of comprehensive final examination  
  
3\. Application of integrative science concepts to problem solving |

  * Propose and carry out a science project
  * Present the results of the science project in written, visual, and oral form

|

Results of written science project report. (See next page for one example of a
rating method)  
  
4\. Understanding of relationships between science and society

|

  * Analyze science as an integrated whole and as an influence on culture and society

|

Results of questions 19-27, 41-45 of the comprehensive final examination  
  
5\. Understanding of related technologies and their costs and benefits

Criteria for Assessing and Grading a Science Project

**

(Adapted from Walvoord, B.E. and Anderson, V.J. (1998). _Effective grading: A
tool for learning and assessment_. San Francisco: Jossey Bass.  
---  
  
5 = Outstanding

4 = Very Good

3 = Adequate

2 = Weak

1 = Poor

**

Introduction:** Clearly identifies the purpose of the project; identifies
interested audiences; adopts an appropriate tone.

|

5 4 3 2 1  
---|---  
**

Format: **All material placed in the correct sections; organized logically
within each section; runs parallel among different sections.

|

5 4 3 2 1  
**

Materials and Methods:** Contains effective, quantifiable, concisely organized
information; identifies sources of all data to be collected; identifies
sequential information in an appropriate chronology; does not contain
unnecessary, wordy descriptions of procedures.

|

5 4 3 2 1  
**

Design: **Student selects factors that are appropriate to the project purpose
and audience; measures adequate aspects of these factors; establishes
subgroups for which data significance may vary; demonstrates an ability to
eliminate bias from the design and bias-ridden statements from the project;
selects appropriate sample size, equivalent groups, and statistics.

|

5 4 3 2 1  
**

Collecting Data and Communicating Results: **Student selects quantifiable
factors and defines units of comparison; measures the factors and units in
appropriate quantities or intervals; selects appropriate statistical
information to be used in the results; displays results in graphs with
correctly labeled axes; data are presented to reader in text as well as
graphic forms

|

5 4 3 2 1  
**

Interpreting Data:** Student summarizes the purpose and findings of the
project; draws inferences that are consistent with the data and scientific
reasoning and relates these to interested audiences; explains expected results
and offers explanations or suggestions for further research for unexpected
results; presents data honestly, distinguishes between fact and implication,
and avoids overgeneralizing.

An extremely useful assessment method which builds on the criteria identified
here is Primary Trait Analysis (PTA). In PTA, the aggregate sub-scores for
each of the six criteria would be calculated. In that way, the instructor can
discern overall strengths and weaknesses in a student cohort. For example, PTA
may reveal that, in general, students do well in developing an introduction
(criterion 1), but are weaker in interpreting their data (criterion 6). Course
adjustments could then be made accordingly.

**Goals of the course** :

The primary aim of this course is to familiarize the student with the
characters and events of ancient Greek and Roman myths. We shall, however,
move beyond mere narrative to consider the possible interpretations of these
myths. Ancient Greeks retold their myths in many contexts; in song, in
dramatic performance, in written literature, and in plastic arts such as
sculpture and ceramic design. The myths can be seen to rehearse the central
concerns of ancient Greek culture, and as such they can give us a greater
understanding of a society which is very different from ours but which has
often been influential in the evolution of the West. Because of the
similarities and differences between our culture and those of the ancient
Mediterranean, the study of these cultures can give us further insights into
the workings of our own society. Later Western art and literature, for
instance, have frequently reworked ancient myths in ways that can illumine
both ancient and contemporary culture.



**Responsibilities in the course** :

Students are responsible for attending all classes and for all assigned
readings. Lectures will cover the readings but will on occasion include other
material; students will also be responsible for this additional material.
Although the chief method of instruction in this class will be the lecture,
questions and discussion are welcomed. Regular quizzes will test your mastery
of readings and lecture material.

Grades will depend on performance in quizzes and in three in-class tests,
which will include short essays. Students enrolled in CC 352 will also be
required to write a short paper, due on **November 23rd**. Grades will be
calculated as follows:



CC 352: Quizzes: 25%

Three in-class tests: 20% each (= 60%)

[Paper:](paper_guidelines.html) 15%

CC 303: Quizzes 25%

Three in-class tests: 25% each  |

There will be no make-ups for quizzes or tests, but you may drop one quiz
grade (i.e. your worst quiz grade will not be included in your grade for the
course).

There are no midterms or final in this class: this means that you will have to
turn in good performances on each of the graded assignments rather than
waiting till the end of the semester to do any work.

Grades are calculated according to University practice: A = 90-100%, B = 80-89
%, C = 70-79%, D = 60-69%, F = 0-59%.

Scholastic dishonesty on any test will result in a failing grade (F) for that
test which may not be dropped. Scholastic dishonesty includes any kind of
cheating; if you are unsure about the exact definition you should consult 'A
Students' Guide to Living in the Heart of Texas' or the General Information
Bulletin.



**Supplementary Instruction**



Our TA for this course, _J. P. Stemwedel_ , has undergone training in
Supplementary Instruction (SI) and will be giving a short presentation on this
topic on Friday 8/28. SI is a student assistance program designed to help
students master the concepts of a course and at the same time to increase
their competency in the learning skills relevant to the course. J. P.'s
additional SI sections are highly recommended.

**Links of Interest**

You might want to investigate the [Greek Mythology
Link](http://www.maicar.com/), which has lots of images and information about
the various characters you will encounter. The [Perseus
Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/) is a comprehensive introduction to
ancient Greek culture. The
[Diotima](http://www.uky.edu/ArtsSciences/Classics/gender.html) site is a
great place to research information and images about women in the ancient
world.

**EXAMINATIONS**. A mid-term examination and a final examination will be given
during the semester. Both exams will consist of slide identifications and
essay questions requiring comparative architectural analysis of buildings.
Graduate students will be given an additional essay questions to meet college
curriculum requirements. There will be no make-up exams unless a student
presents a bona fide reason for missing the regularly scheduled exam.

**CLASSICAL ORDERS ASSIGNMENT.** Students will be asked to select any building
on campus that employs a classical order and sketch the details of that order,
identifying the order and its various parts and moldings. The due date is
marked on the syllabus.  
  
**PAPERS.** Two papers, each no more than 1000 words in length and based upon
criteria distributed by the instructor, will be required. Papers must be typed
and double-spaced and include illustrations. The first paper focuses on
building descriptions, the second on architectural analysis. Due dates are
marked on the syllabus. Illustrations should be neatly mounted and clearly
identified. Follow the format for footnotes and bibliography given in the
Chicago Manual of Style. Grades will be lowered by one point for each twenty-
four hour period that the paper is late.

**GRADES**. Grades will be based on the average of the two examinations and
three assignments. Attendance and class participation are also considered. No
additional work is assigned in order to raise a final grade.

**BIBLIOGRAPHY**. A bibliography of readings for further study on each of the
lecture topics will also be distributed to students. This list should be
considered as a beginning point for research concerning the topics identified
and should be consulted during selection and preparation of the papers.

**OFFICE HOURS.** Office hours will be announced by the instructor, and a list
of available half-hour segments will be posted at 210 Wheeler House. Students

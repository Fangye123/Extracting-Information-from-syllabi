###  How This Electronic Syllabus Works

I am putting this syllabus on the web to provide you with a set of links to
electronic sources in South Asian studies. If you are starting with a hard-
copy of the syllabus, you can reach the electronic syllabus by going to the
Bates Home Page on Netscape (www.bates.edu), clicking on Faculty, then going
to Anthropology, and Courses offered in Autumn Semester 2000. Get out there on
the web and find out more about the topics discussed in this course. Alta
Vista is a wonderful search engine. It is listed on the Netscape page of
search engines, along with Yahoo and Lycos. Don't be limited by my links. Use
Alta Vista to find your own by entering the topic you want to know more about.

###  The Course

PEOPLES AND SOCIETIES OF SOUTH ASIA focuses its attention on everyday life in
a variety of societies in South Asia--India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka,
Nepal, and the Himalayan states. It proceeds not so much geographically as
topically, focusing on social practices that dominate South Asian life, caste,
family, marriage, ritual, gender relations, and renunciation, using Hinduism
as a context to tie these practices together. At the end of the course I want
to talk about colonialism and its aftermath because a major issue in the study
of South Asian society is not just the changes brought by British rule over
South Asia, but the way British rule itself created Indian tradition as it now
exists. This year I will also take up the career of M.K. Gandhi, a man who was
both the most ordinary of South Asians and the most extraordinary.

My hope is that this course will increase student interest in South Asia and
illuminate the contrast between individualism in societies such as our own and
the holism of traditional societies. That contrast is both a powerful way to
approach South Asia and an useful way to understand what distinguishes Western
societies as such. In this regard, this course concerns us as much as a
distant part of the world.

##  Course Requirements

    
  Course Requirements | An in-class examination on October 17 is worth 25% of
the final grade.  A short research paper is worth another 25%, and the final
is worth 35%.  The balance (15%) depends on class participation.  
---|---  
  
I value what students have to say and will try to encourage everyone to voice
their opinions.  I am not very good at drawing out people who do not raise
their hands.  Help me out--raise your hand.  Allocating 15% of the final grade
to class participation represents a gentle form of coercion, but I believe
learning to talk in an academic setting is as important as learning to think
analytically or use a computer. Students usually assume that they are being
judged on the content of their comments. I judge students merely on whether
they say something. There are no dumb comments--there are only students who do
not contribute to class and students who do. In my experience, the only
mistake a student makes in class is imagining her or his comments are worth
airing on every topic. If you are a verbal person, let other people have a
chance at it. If you are not, recognize that your ideas may well be more
incisive than those of people who talk regularly. Make an effort to make your
ideas known, whether it is the first day of class or late November.

What I would like you to do for the only non-orthodox requirement for this
course is to write a paper--of 8 pages or so--critiquing or commenting on one
of the course's reading assignments in an adverturesome way. The first part of
the assignment is to lay out what you find interesting or unconvincing in the
reading; the second part of the assignment requires research on your part.

Your job is to put the reading in some larger intellectual context, which
means that I want you to do one of several things, beginning with important
points raised in the article or book you've chosen:  


  1. Compare the issue under discussion to some other part of South Asian life--another time, place, or community. We've talked about caste in a village context. Are there interesting examples, for example, of caste working differently in urban settings?
  2. For some readings, you can put the issue in that context by thinking about the competing claims of text and context, What does the textual tradition, for instance, say about life cycle rituals? What differences appear when one begins to focus on a particular caste's observance of those rituals?
  3. Simply go more deeply into the material by way of further readings in the library. Doing well on this assignment requires taking on an issue from your reading and expanding on it--not by way of your feelings about it by by investigating other sources.
  4. What other questions need to be asked of this material and why? Approaching the paper from this perspective requires more argumentation than simply asserting, "I think Rudolph should have discussed the position of ordinary villagers in the British Raj" because that is interesting (to me or to you). Of course it is entirely legitimate to say that Rudolph should have discussed ordinary people or villagers or the poor more thoroughly, but for the commentary you are writing it is legitimate only to the extent that what he does not say about these categories diminishes, contradicts, or recasts what she does say (about the British Raj and so on).

  
Ladd Library has a great collection of South Asian materials. You will not be
thwarted by lack of material, and the assignment requires not simply speaking
about the readings, but commenting on those readings by way of your own
efforts to sort out a particular issues that emerges in the reading by looking
at other readings. You can also get ideas by visiting the various South Asian
newsgroups and sites on the web.

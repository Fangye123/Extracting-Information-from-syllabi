## Course Overview

This course provides an overview of juvenile behavior and the juvenile justice
system in American society. We assume a critical approach by exploring the
history and social construction of "juvenile delinquency" as a "social
phenomenon." But a good portion of this course will examine juvenile behavior
in-depth, looking particularly at theoretical explanations for "delinquent"
behavior, experiences, and the organizational processes and politics of the
contemporary juvenile justice system. The course emphasizes a participatory
and hands-on approach.

## Team Assignments

**Team Assignment #1 ~ Due 9/7/99**

  * **Internet Research on the social distribution of juvenile crime**

This assignment requires you to perform internet research using the electronic
links provided in this syllabus/web page. Refer to the following web site and
look for data on youth crime broken down by race, age, gender, and
socioeconomic status. You may also refer to other web sites listed in this
syllabus/web page. You may want to, for example, look at juvenile arrest rates
(go to juvenile justice and then fact sheets) and how they differ by
demographic categories (race, age, gender, and socioeconomic status). You will
present your findings to the class on September 7 or 9.

Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention. http://www.ncjrs.org

**Team Assignment #2 ~ Due 9/14/99**

  * **The production of graffiti and the notion of "victim"**

This assignment requires you to find a graffiti site and analyze it in respect
to its producers/creators, social meaning(s), and its representation in the
larger community. In other words, who do you believe produced/created this
site? What kind of social meaning can you derive from it? And, what do you
think it represents/signifies in the larger community? Is it an art form, a
contribution to the community? Or, is it an act of vandalism, signifying
community decay, making the community, in general, its larger victim?

HAND IN: Each group member needs to write (NO hand writing!) a description of
their contribution to the group on this assignment. These descriptions should
be stapled together and handed in as a group on the due date.

This assignment requires your team to read and present one of the following
chapters from the book titled _Renegade Kids, Suburban Outlaws._ The first
chapters are about "renegade kids," who are, according to the author Wayne
Wooden, "identity seekers who are relatively socially harmless." The second
set of chapters are about "suburban outlaws" who are, according to the author,
"the nonconformist and rebellious youths who are prone to lawbreaking."

recent wave of school shootings in respect to your chapter. In particular,
discuss how the students involved in the school shootings may or may not fit
this characterization.

be stapled together and handed in as a group on the due date.

* * *

## Film Review ~ Due December 7, 1999

This assignment requires you to view a film using some of the conceptual tools
you learned in this course. It is preferred that you work in your team on this
project. More specifically, you need to apply a theory or theories to the
content of the film, drawing on psychological or structural theories (Chapters
3 and 4 in _Sociology of Juvenile Delinquency_ ). In doing this, you will be
searching for theoretical explanations for the behavior of the juveniles
represented in the film. End your paper by discussing how the film represented
society's response to the delinquent behavior(s) and whether or not you agree
with it.

The paper should be two to three pages, double space with 10-12 point font. It
will be graded based on 1) the theoretical content (clarity in which you
present the theory and apply it to the film) (50 percent), 2) Innovativeness
(developing insights and new thoughts) (30 percent), and Grammar (20 percent).

You should write your paper individually, while you should work with your team
in brainstorming ideas and discussing them.

You will then present some of the main ideas of your paper to the class along
with your team members on one of the last four days of class. Your papers are
due on December 7, 1999.

You are free to choose any film that deals with Juvenile delinquency. But I am
providing some ideas for you here that have been suggested in a Juvenile
Delinquency course at University Park.

_Suburbia_  
_My Own Private Idaho_  
_The Outsiders_  
_Oliver_  
_My Bodyguard_  
_Menace II Society_  
_Pretty Baby_  
_Lord of the Flies_  
_Clockwork Orange_  
_Trainspotting_  
_Carrie_  
_The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane_  
_Rebel Without a Cause_

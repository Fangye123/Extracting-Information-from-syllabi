**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
  

> The idea of memory has emerged as a subject of serious scholarship at a time
when the viability of nationalism and its attendant discipline of history have
encountered serious criticisms. This colloquium intends to discuss the
literature on the problem of national memory in nineteenth century Europe and
America. Topically it will look at the rise of national history in the
nineteenth century and the ideas and symbols that were deployed to promote its
acceptance. The subject of war and remembering will occupy considerable class
attention. The impact of the Civil War in the United States, two world wars in
Europe, and the Holocaust had crucial consequences for people living in
postwar cultures. Wars raised questions about the promise of nationalism for
better futures based upon reason and progress; they produced traumatic
memories of brutality and loss that promoted widespread cultural debates about
the very viability of earlier histories and memories that had glossed over the
violent potential of nations themselves. Postwar discussions about the past
were driven as much by victims of brutality as they were by citizens dreaming
of progress and justice. They were also shaped by the products of mass
culture. Thus, memory will also be examined in many of its "frames" such as
films, novels, monuments and museums.

**ASSIGNMENTS:**  
  

Each student will submit a question based on the common readings **(indicated
in boldface in the syllabus)** for the entire class (students and instructors)
via email, due no later than 8 p.m. on the Monday preceding our Tuesday
afternoon meeting.  
  

East student will give three reports in class on the course of the semester,
to be chosen from the readings signaled in italics for each week. Each oral
report should be accompanied by a one-page summary of the comments to be made
in class. The written reports will be due in class in three copies, one of
which will be kept in a common file, to be available to all members of the
class during the semester.  
  

Each student will write a midterm and final essay for the course. The papers
will synthesize relevant readings for the first part and the second part of
the course and will attempt to offer an original interpretation. Each paper
will be no more than eight pages, double-spaced. Due dates are indicated on
the syllabus.  
  

Plagiarism, which is the representation of someone else's work as your own,
will be grounds for a failing grade.  
  
**WEEKLY TOPICS AND READINGS:**  
  

Common readings for the week are indicated in **BOLDFACE**. The common
readings not available for purchase will be available both on closed reserves
in the Main Library and in photocopied form in the graduate student lounge.
Please be considerate to the other students when taking these photocopies to
be read/recopied.  
  

Readings to be chosen for reports are indicated in _ITALICS_. These readings
will be available on open reserves in the Main Library.  
  

The other readings are recommended, and can be used in writing the midterm and
final essays, as well as for further in-class discussion.

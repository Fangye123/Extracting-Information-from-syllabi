## Notes:

1\. All written work must meet the standards of basic expository writing and
must follow the style outlined in the MLA Handbook. Grammar, clarity, style,
and documentation count and will affect your grade.  
2\. Prompt, consistent attendance is important to the success of the class and
will be reflected in each student's final grade. Any student who misses more
than 4 classes will have his or her final grade lowered by one full letter
grade. Any student who misses more than 8 classes will have his or her final
grade lowered by 2 full letter grades. Students who miss more than 10 classes
are not likely to receive a passing grade and should consult with the
instructor about withdrawing from the class. In the case of absences the
student is responsible for gathering all material covered in class. Under
ordinary circumstances, quizzes and other graded in-class assignments may not
be made up. Attendance at examinations is mandatory.  
3\. Class begins promptly. In order to fully participate in the class session
and receive credit for attending, students must arrive in class by the time
that attendance is called. If lateness is unavoidable, the student is welcome
to join the class, but is expected not to disrupt the session already in
progress. Students should also arrive promptly for exams. Extended time will
not be granted to students who arrive late to exams.  
4\. Assignments must be completed on time. After the deadline, a grade of zero
will be entered for work not received.  
5\. Papers may ordinarily not be rewritten for a higher grade.  
6\. All written assignments must be submitted on paper. Work submitted on
computer disk will not be accepted.  
7\. Grades of "incomplete" may not be given except in cases of verified
medical or other emergencies.  
8\. Plagiarism violates the expectation of honesty among scholars without
which there can be no intellectual inquiry. The Theatre Department will not
tolerate plagiarism. Any student found guilty of such an offense will be
failed for the course and at the discretion of the faculty member may be
brought before the University Student Judicial Board for dismissal from the
institution.  
9\. Students may not repeat a course more than once without prior permission
from the Academic Standards Committee.  
10\. Students with disabilities are given every opportunity to participate in
theatre classes even if such participation requires adjustment to the means by
which course requirements are met. Students must notify the instructor at the
beginning of the semester if they require special consideration.  
11\. Food and drink are not permitted in the classroom.  
12\. The learning environment in this class is based upon an atmosphere of
mutual respect, which will be maintained at all times. Students are expected
to adhere to the code of student conduct as outlined in appendix F section II
of the university catalog.  
Please consult me if you have questions about any of these requirements.

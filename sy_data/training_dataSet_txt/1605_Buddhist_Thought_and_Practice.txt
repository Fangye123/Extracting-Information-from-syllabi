Buddhism has been one of the major connective links among the varied cultures of South, Southeast, and East
	Asia for over two millennia, and in this century it has established a solid presence in Europe and North America.
	This course will survey the history, doctrines, and practices of Buddhism in South Asia, Tibet, and East Asia.
	Readings will be in both primary texts and secondary sources, and will be supplemented by films and slides. The
	format will be a combination of lecture and discussion.

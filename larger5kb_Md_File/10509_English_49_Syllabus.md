"Whiteness" and Racial Difference**  
MWF 10:30 - 11:20am, LPAC 201  
  
A look at the conflicted ways in which "racial" identities and differences
have been constructed in past and contemporary cultures, especially in the
U.S. Topics given emphasis in the syllabus include why saying "race doesn't
matter" is not enough; how a new debates about the history of race have
changed American Studies and feminist studies; how European immigrants to the
U.S. became "white" and with what benefits and what costs; how popular culture
can both resist and perpetuate racist culture; and an introduction to issues
of "passing," multi-racial identity, and recovering a multiracial past. The
format of the class will include both lecture and student-led discussion.  
  
**Note for English majors: This course can be counted as a "theory" course

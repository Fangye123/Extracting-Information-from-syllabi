**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

History 110 is a survey of world history from the earliest periods of human
development and the beginnings of civilization to the emergence of European
hegemony in the sixteenth century. The course is designed to familiarize
students with the distinctive cultural experiences of major civilizations of
the ancient, classical, and medieval worlds; to provide students with the
foundational background for their introduction to "the modern age" in History
120; and to acquaint students with the methods and techniques historians and
other researchers use to uncover the past and re-create the story of human
development.  

History 110 reflects a global emphasis in its representation of major
civilizations and their contributions to the human experience. Civilizations
studied include those of the ancient Middle and Near East; India and the Far
East (China and Japan); the classical civilizations of Greece and Rome; the
later civilizations of Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  

The course emphasizes the social history of civilizations through the ages and
around the world, recreating the everyday life of ordinary people in the
context of their economic, political, intellectual, cultural, religious, and
geographic environment.

**COURSE OUTLINE AND ASSIGNMENT SCHEDULE**

The following cultures and their contributions to the development of human
civilization will be covered in History 110:  

  1. The first unit of the semester will be devoted to the earliest civilizations in western Asia and Egypt, the Indus River Valley, and ancient China, which together form the foundation of a substantial portion of the modern world.
  2. The second unit will deal with the Greeks, the Romans, and the early medieval period in Europe.
  3. The third unit will deal with the beginnings of the Islamic Empire, the early development of sub-Saharan Africa, pre-Columbian America, medieval India, and China, and the beginnings of Japanese civilization.
  4. The fourth and final unit of this class deals with the new centers of civilization in the Americas, southeast Asia, the high middle ages in Europe, and the emergence of new world patterns as the Renaissance swept the western world.

Each unit, which comprises approximately two chapters per week in the
textbook, will be followed by an examination. As you follow the syllabus in
your reading, please pay special attention to the questions in each section
below, and also to those at the end of each chapter in the textbook. They are
designed to stimulate and guide your thoughts about the reading; if you can
answer them satisfactorily you will have made substantial progress in
accomplishing the goals of this course. Please note also that the reading
assignments are listed week by week. Your instructor will tell you what your
assignments are for each day, depending on whether your section of the class
meets MWF or TR.

**REQUIREMENTS**  

**Assignments**  

Assignments for this class will include reading, writing, and special
projects. Readings may be assigned not only from the text, but also from
photocopied materials and library books. Attendance at certain cultural
functions may also be required. Students are responsible for all work assigned
in this class, whether or not they are present. Assignments must be completed
on time, and short quizzes may be given on assigned materials at any time.  

The Instructor Option for sections 07 and 05 consists of a series of homework
exercises, including Civilization Worksheets, Timeline Worksheets, Map
Exercises, and Primary Source Analyses.  The forms and instructions for some
of these exercises can be accessed from the class web site ([click
here](hist110.htm#Links)).  These exercises are group assignments to be
completed by the study teams to which each student will be assigned.  Specific
instructions will be given in class and on this web site.

  
**Attendance and Punctuality**

This course follows the guidelines for the university's attendance policy.
Students are responsible for knowing and abiding by this policy. Note that TR
classes count as 1.5 class hours and Saturday classes count as 3 class hours.
Any student arriving after the instructor has finished calling the roll may be
considered tardy, and two incidents of unexcused tardiness count as one
unexcused absence. No student will be permitted to leave class before
dismissal except with the permission of the instructor. For the purposes of
attendance, an unexcused early departure counts the same as unexcused
tardiness.  
  
  
**Special Note on Academic Honesty**

Students should be aware that a university is a community of scholars
committed to the discovery and dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without
freedom to investigate all materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting
findings, and proper acknowledgment of credit, such a community can not
survive. Students are expected to adhere to the highest traditions of
scholarship. Infractions of these traditions, such as plagiarism (cheating),
are not tolerated. Misrepresenting someone else's words or ideas as one's own
constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism occurs, the instructor has
the right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks appropriate. One
guideline holds that the first offence results in failure of the assignment,
the second offence in failure of the course. See the Student Handbook for
definitions and procedures.

Group assignments require a special note. Each member of the study team is
expected to contribute to the assignment. Every member of the team gets the
same grade for the assignment. A student who does not contribute is
essentially misrepresenting someone else's words and ideas as one's own. This
is academic dishonesty, and it will be treated as such.  
  
**Class Participation**

All students are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the assigned
material. This implies that students should read the material before class.
Perfect comprehension is not expected at the beginning of class, but students
should be familiar with the topic and the major points, and they should have
identified areas they do not understand well enough to ask focused,
intelligent questions about them. Any student may, at any time, be called upon
to recite, or to write a short essay on, the assigned material.  

Students are expected to observe normal courtesy in class. They are expected
to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to refrain from
personal conversation, and to avoid any other behavior that disturbs others. A
student who does not observe these courtesies may be asked to leave the room.

**TEACHING STRATEGIES**

This course is taught primary through lecture. Collaborative study groups will
be used for homework assignments.  
  
  
**REFERENCES AND LINKS**

The textbook provides a bibliography at the end of each chapter.  Students can
go to the instructor's [Links](../../Links.htm) page for a number of sites
relevant to world history.

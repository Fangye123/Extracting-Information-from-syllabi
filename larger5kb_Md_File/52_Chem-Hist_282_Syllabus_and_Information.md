**_COURSE DESCRIPTION AND REQUIREMENTS_**

**LECTURES AND ASSIGNED READINGS:** The lectures, texts and library
assignments for the course are designed to complement each other. Texts are
not a replacement for lectures, nor _vice versa_. The instructors will assume
that all reading assignments have been completed as assigned and will
structure their lectures accordingly. Students are urged to attend the
lectures diligently, as much of the material for the course is only available
from that source. Once class rolls are correct, however, no formal attendance
will be taken.

**_ToTop of the Page_**

**LIBRARY ASSIGNMENTS:** In addition to the three assigned textbooks, several
reading assignments are on reserve in the TTU library under the title,
"Readings". They are catalogued under the course number (Chemistry/History
282) and instructors' names. These assignments are indicated on the syllabus
as "Reserve" and should be read according to the schedule. This material
includes contemporary documents of significance in the history of science, as
well as historical discussions of historically important experiments. Students
are expected to complete these assignments and will be held accountable for
this material on the examinations.

On Reserve:  
"Agassiz and Gray"  
"The Atom"  
"Pasteur"  
"Toward Modern Physics"  
"Contemporary Biology"  
"Scale of the Universe"  
"This Changing Earth"

**EXAMINATIONS:** Three examinations will be given during the semester. Each
is MANDATORY and will determine one-third of the course grade. As deemed
appropriate by the instructors, each exam may be a combination of essay
questions, short answer sections, computation exercises or other formats.
Essay questions will be chosen by the instructors from lists distributed
several days before the scheduled examination. On the day of the examination,
students will answer the selected essay (and other portions of the exam)
without use of notes or other  "helpful" material. All examinations will be
based on lecture material AND assigned readings from the texts and library
assignments. None will be comprehensive. Examinations are to be written in
"Blue Books," available at the University Bookstore. "Make-up" examinations
will only be given to those students who present written proof of their
inability to take the original exam. No "extra credit" work will be accepted.
(GRADING SCALE: A=90-; B=80-89; C=70-79; D=60-69; F=0-59)

**ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:** _Office Hours_ for each instructor will be
scheduled and posted on his office door. In addition, each instructor has
"Voice Mail" at his office phone number and is available by e-mail (Furtsch:
tfurtsch; Webb: gwebb). Students must understand, however, that each
instructor has a large number of responsibilities in addition to
Chemistry/History 282. These responsibilities include other classes and
various committee and similar assignments at the department, college, and
university level. Both instructors are heavily involved in scholarly pursuits
and are active in professional organizations of local, state, and national
scope. These many responsibilities may occasionally require modification of
scheduled office hours during the semester.

_The information included in this syllabus is tentative. Any changes in
lecture topics, examination schedule, reading assignments, or other aspects of
the course will be announced in class. In addition, the course now has a web
page, accessible through the chemistry department web site._

**ADA Statement: _Any student who believes he or she will require special
consideration to meet the requirements for this course must consult the Office
of Disability Services (UC 112; x6119) during the first week of classes._**

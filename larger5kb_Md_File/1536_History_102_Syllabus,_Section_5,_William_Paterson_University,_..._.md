**Course Requirements**  

**Grades:** There will be 3 tests and a journal project. Each of the tests
will count 23% of the final grade. (This final exam is  NOT cumulative; each
test stands alone). The journal project constitutes 16% of the final grade.
The remaining 15% of the final grade will be derived from student
participation in classroom exercises.  
  

**Attendance** Since participation counts toward your grade, I will require
you to attend class. If a student misses three classes, the final grade will
be reduced 10 points. Five unexcused absences will result in an "F". If
tardiness becomes a problem, I will bar the door after the start of class.  

**Journal Project** Each student will turn in a weekly 1 page summary of what
they learned from using the document readings during the previous week. I'm
looking for an overview that incorporates the textbooks and class discussions,
but it should be personalized using the documents you actually read.  
Every Tuesday each student will be assigned a specific document from the
Weisner book for which she or he will be responsible for reading, summarizing,
and presenting to the class on the Thursday of the subsequent week. Very few
students will have the same document, so don't expect someone else to do the
reading for you, or you may be surprised when they expected you to do it.  
  
On Thursdays, each student should be prepared to present the document assigned
the previous week to the class. In addition to the document, all students are
responsible for the introductions and epilogues assigned in the Weisner
document book.  
  
On the Tuesday following the discussion, each student will turn in a typed
summary/overview described above. I will not accept hand written copies of the
assignment; they must be typed, double-spaced, and conform to standard margins
and fonts. I expect each summary to consist of not less than a single page,
and not more than two pages.  
  
I will accept late journal assignments only upon documented proof of an
illness or an emergency. Missed in-class assignments cannot be made-up, but
will still require documentation to avoid receiving a zero.  
  
A quick note about plagiarism. Plagiarism is the quoting or the paraphrasing
of any portion of another author's words or ideas without giving full credit
to the original author. In short, it is theft of intellectual property. Anyone
caught plagiarizing will dealt with according to the academic integrity policy
found in the student handbook.  
  

**Tests:** The first two tests each will take one class period. The third test
will take place during finals and will receive the allotted time for a final.
Approximately half of each test will be objective questions including (but not
limited to) multiple choice questions and chronology matching, while the
remainder of each test will consist of an essay.  
  

**Make-up Tests:** All make-up tests will be essay tests and will take place
on the last day of class for the semester. If you know you will miss an exam,
you should let me know as soon as you know, and at least **3 class days** in
advance of the test. If an emergency unavoidably prevents you from attending a
test, you should contact me immediately following your return to school and
provide me with whatever documentation I will require to allow you to take a
make-up. If you fail to contact me in a timely manner, I will not permit the
make-up.  
  

**Final Exam Conflicts:** You must tell me at least 2 weeks before the end of
classes that you have a conflict or you will have to work out the conflict
with someone else.

**Attendance Policy:**  
Attendance in this class is _STRONGLY RECOMMENDED_. Because we will follow a
lecture/discussion format, class participation is expected. If a student
arrives after the roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to make
sure his or her presence has been recorded at the end of the period. If a
student has eleven absences, excused or unexcused, he or she will
automatically fail the course.

Make-up policy:  
Make-up exams will be administered only for excused absences, confirmed by
documentation. Students must schedule the make-up exam with the instructor
within one week of their return. Failure to make such arrangements will result
in failure of the course.

**Book Reviews/Discussions**  
All students will be required to write a 500-word review FOR EACH of the
following three books assigned for this class:

Jamieson, Perry D.  _Death in September:   The Antietam Campaign_.  Abilene,
Tex.:  McWhiney  
    Foundation Press, 1998.   
Woodworth, Steven E.  _A Deep Steady Thunder: The Battle of Chickamauga._
Abilene, Tex.:  
    McWhiney Foundation Press, 1998.   
Coffey, David.  _John Bell Hood and the Struggle for Atlanta_.   Abilene,
Tex.:  McWhiney  
    Foundation Press, 1998. 

These reviews should contain the following information:  
1\. Brief summary of the book's contents.  
2\. Discussion of the book's major thesis.  
3\. The review should also relate your estimation of the author's success in
achieving his or her objectives, use of sources, organization, and
presentation.  
4\. You should include examples from the book to support your insights and
conclusions about the book.  
5\. You should conclude with a statement of whether the book or article is
most appropriate for a scholarly audience or a general audience.

The first two reviews (Jamieson and Woodworth books) will be due in class on
Tuesday, March 23, after the discussion of those books.  The third review
(Coffey book) will be due in class on Tuesday, April 13, after the discussion
of that book.  **_Five points per day will be deducted from the review grade
for every day it is late._**

The reviews will each receive a separate grade, but these grades will be
averaged together with discussion grades for an overall Review/Discussion
grade average, which will constitute 10% of the course grade for the semester.

Discussion:  
All students are required to prepare a TYPED list of at least five pertinant
discussion questions for each book.  These questions should be analytical in
nature, designed to provoke discussion on significant points and arguments
presented by the authors of the books. Questions can link ideas from the books
to information received elsewhere in the class.  They can target areas of
interpretation, motivation, thesis, etc.  Do not get so specific that the
question will not generate discussion.  These lists should be attached to the
book review and turned in at the end of the discussion.  The quality of
discussion questions on your list will be a factor in your Review/Discussion
grade average.

**If you are absent on the discussion days, you will recieve a grade of "0"
for that discussion.  However, if the absence is excused, you will be required
to schedule a time to discuss the book(s) with the instructor on an individual
basis to receive a grade for your discussion.

**Final Exam Essay**  
For 40% of the final exam grade, all students will be required to write a
1,000- to 1,500-word essay (4-6 typed, double-spaced pages) on the following
topic:

Choose any state that was part of the United States during the years
1848-1877, and write an essay arguing what _single_ event during this time
period had the most serious, historically lasting impact on that state.
**You may not choose Virginia as your state**.   Choose your event carefully
and think about what historical consequences came from that event.  By "event"
I mean a singular occurrence, such as a meeting, a battle, a speech, a law, a
decision, a court ruling, or other similar activity (for instance "the Civil
War" would be much too broad).  You should present your argument in a strong
narrative essay with evidence cited with footnotes (or endnotes), as required
by the department style guide and as seen in Turabian (if you do not know what
this is--ask).

You must use _at least_ five scholarly sources for this project, one of which
must be a _primary source._ You may not use encyclopedias, magazine articles
(unless used as a primary source to depict historical consequences of an
event), or text books.  You may use internet sources, **but be very careful in
what you use--make sure they are scholarly, and make sure you cite the URL
location and date you viewed that site in you footnotes.**   There are now
thousands of primary sources from this period of American history posted on
the internet.  (Look at the Longwood Library Webpage for guidance).

Your pages should be numbered and your essay should contain a title page with
a title, your name, Course number and name, instructor's name, and the date.

This essay is due **at the beginning of class, on Tuesday, April 27 (the last
day of class).   Ten points per day will be deducted from the essay grade for
every day the essay is late.  All papers turned in after the BEGINNING of
class on April 27 will be considered one day late.**

**Final Exam Essay Style Guide**

Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT  
use parenthetical notes. Only footnotes and endnotes will be acceptable!
Please consult Kate L.  
Turabian, A Manual for Writers. 6th ed.  Students should also consult the
Department of History and Political Science Style Manual, which is now
available on-line ([click
here](http://web.lwc.edu/academic/las/history/HDPTSTS2.htm)).

Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.

The following are some useful examples from Turabian:

Footnoting a book:  
     1Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938),   
33\.  
    
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,

     2Ibid., 37. (Note that Ibid. is not underlined or italicized) 

If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,

     17Waley, _Analects_ , 130. 

Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
     3Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in_   
_Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, l986), 402.

Footnoting a Review:

**Plagiarism**

Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in a student
paper without giving  
proper credit to the author constitutes plagiarism. Likewise the use of an
author's words without  
placing those words in quotation marks and providing proper citation is
plagiarism. Students  
sometimes believe that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in
a sentence or  
paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism. This is not the case! The information
and ideas taken from a  
source must be re-formed into your own words! And after re-forming it into
your own words, you  
must use a footnote giving proper credit to the author.

If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
essay will be returned  
ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to his office to verify
the scholarship.

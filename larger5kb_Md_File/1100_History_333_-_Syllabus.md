**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

The Italian Renaissance - the "rebirth" of learning that lasted roughly from
the mid-fourteenth to the sixteenth century and had its roots in the city of
Florence - was an important, transformative moment in the cultural history of
western Europe, yet in many ways it is still poorly understood. Partly, as we
shall see, this was due to past prejudices. As the modern disciplines took
shape in the nineteenth century a number of factors came together that
prevented us from seeing the earlier era on its own terms. In this course we
shall try to transcend that problem by reading some original sources and
getting a sense of what Renaissance thinkers themselves thought they were
doing. We shall also pay attention to their social context - the "real" world
in which they lived - and try to configure on our own terms what the era means
for us today.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

(1) Course attendance and informed participation in discussions, discussion
exercises, and quizzes (20%). It is essential that you do the readings on
time. To ensure that this happens there will be occasional quizzes on the
readings. You are responsible for having read the week's readings by Monday of
that week.  
(2) Exams. There will be a mid-term examination (15%) and a final (20%), both
composed of essays and short written identification questions. On the exams
you will have substantial opportunity for choice on the questions. Both exams
are cumulative, although on the final the emphasis will fall more on the
material covered in the second half of the course. **Mid-term exam date:
Wednesday 17 October; Final exam date: Wednesday, 12 December, 12:45-2:45.**  
(3) Papers. You will be expected to write two papers. The first is a short
book review or analytical paper (3-5 pages = 900-1500 words; 15% of final
grade). This paper should consist of informed, critical analysis and not just
summary of the work or works under discussion. **The short paper is** **due
Wednesday 3 October** and the book for review or the paper topic must be
okayed by me by week four of the course, i.e., by Wednesday 19 September,
either during office hours, at the end of a class meeting, or by E-mail. For a
book to review you can check the bibliographies in any of the textbooks or
come to me if you need advice.  
    The second paper is a term paper (10-15 pages = 3000-4500 words; 30% of final grade), due on the last of class, i.e., **5 December**. However, by Monday of week twelve of the course ( **12 November** ), a draft with bibliography of at least 10 pages is due; this is not optional.   
    Both papers must be typed or computer-printed. **NO LATE PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED** unless accompanied by a written medical excuse signed by a doctor.

"If literary criticism is ever to conceptualize a new disciplinary
domain, it will have to undertake first a much more thorough reflection
on the historical category of literature; otherwise I suggest that new
critical movements will continue to register their agendas symptomatically,
by ritually overthrowing a continually resurgent literariness and literary
canon. At the same time it is unquestionably the case that several recent
crises of the literary canon--its 'opening' to philosophical works, to
works by minorities, and now to popular and mass cultural works--amounts
to a terminal crisis, more than sufficient evidence of the urgent need
to reconceptualize the object of literary study."

Formation (1993)

Catalogue of Primary Documents: 
Adam
Sedgwick, A
Discourse on the Studies of the University (1833) 
Excerpt taken from part 2, on the study of ancient literature
and the need to make the study of languagues a part of our earliest study,
so as to gain access to the "intellectual treasures of a nation." Sedgwick
also stresses that the function of the university is to "teach profoundly"
not superficially. 
Hutcheson
Macaulay Posnett, Comparative
Literature (1886) 
After receiving four requests for information about Posnett
(which I take to be quite a few), and given the text's  virtual unavailability,
I decided to mount a few excerpts from the sections on "world-literature"
and "national literature." The text is public domain, but so few copies
exist that xeroxing is basically out of the question; thus I have had to
select passages that I think most relevant to the historical foundations
of comparative literature. 
John
Henry Newman, The
Idea of a University (from the Introduction and Discourses 3 and 4;
Newman Center at Caltech) 
D.J.
Palmer, "An
Education for the Industrial Classes" and "The
Muse in Chains" from The Rise of English Studies (1965) 
Franklin
Court, "Introduction"
to Institutionalizing English Literature: The Culture and Politics of
Literary Study, 1750-1900 (1992) 
Chris
Baldick, The
Social Mission of English Criticism 1848-1932 (1983) 
Mary
Wollstonecraft, The
Female Reader: or Miscellaneous pieces in Prose and Verse: Selected
from the Best Writers, and Disposed under Proper Heads: for the Improvement
of Young Women (1789) 
Raymond
Williams, "The
Future of English Literature," (1983) from What I Came to Say
(1989) 
Written two years after the "crisis" at Cambridge, this is
quite a nice reflection on the continuing controversies within English
studies. Williams uses an anecdote of a friend's impermissible utterance
at an "open" encounter group (in California, no less) both to provide an
analogy for the limits contained within a syllabus and to argue that, in
the case of a debate over syllabus reform, one must say the unutterable
and wrest one's interlocutors out of their particular language game. Also
interesting is Williams' use of the figure of a palimpsest-like map of
English literature, one that contains layers of a "selective tradition"
carved out by generations of scholars. The "substratum" of this imagined
map is the crucial issue of the English language. 
Gayatri
Spivak, "Reading
the World: Literary Studies in the Eighties," (1985) 
Excerpts from an essay collected in In Other Worlds
(1987). Interesting to me in that critical reading and pedagogy become
the means of fusing "theory" and the "practical-historical"; teaching literature,
then, means teaching students to "read the world." Great metaphor describing
teachers of literature: "the disc jockeys of an advanced technocracy" (with
the illusion that we're free to play), which she'll carry over to "Explanation
and Culture" in the same volume. (96) 
Thomas
B. Macaulay, "Minute
on Indian Education," (February 1835) 
Long considered the text that put the nail in the coffin, so
to speak, and directly caused the shift in official British educational
policy in India (then Governor-General Lord Bentinck did issue a resolution
in March 1835, declaring that English literature and language were to be
taught to the "natives"), Macaulay's Minute was actually one of many documents
written in the 45 or so years of the Orientalist-Anglicist controversy.
I think its fame derives partly from its rhetoric and partly from both
its positioning (near the end) and Macaulay's (1800-1859) fame at the time
it was published (it wasn't registered in the government office in Bengal
until 1862, after which Sir George Trevelyan presumably copied it, or received
it from someone who copied it, and sent it off to a London magazine). But,
this is speculation; it is still important in terms of the history of English
studies. 
Gauri
Viswanathan, Masks
of Conquest: Literary Study and British Rule in India, (1989) 
Now acknowledged as the definitive study of the "origins" of
English Studies, Masks firmly locates these origins in their colonial
context and argues that the humanizing and civilizing mission widely accepted
to be at the heart of the disipline was absolutely bound up with the civilizing
mission in British India. English studies, then, played a central role
in the British efforts to institute and maintain hegemonic control over
the "natives." One could extract and say that writing
and violence are ever-interwoven. 
Michel
Foucault, "What
Is an Author?"
Excerpts on the "author-function" 
Brian
Massumi, "Translator's
Foreword: Pleasures of Philosophy" (1987) 
From his introduction to Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand
Plateaus, these excerpts point to the example of the University of
Berlin in order to make explicit the connections between philosophy and
the State. As far as I know, Deleuze and Guattari do not specifically address
the university per se in ATP, but Massumi is here connecting the
idea of "State thought" to Lyotard's discussion of the university from
The Postmodern Condition (another major translation of his). I've
included footnotes -- a rare treat -- because of the great insult to Habermas. 
Friedrich
Nietzsche, "We
Scholars" from Beyond Good and Evil (1886) 
Avital
Ronell, "The
Worst Neighborhoods of the Real: Philosophy - Telephone - Communication"
from Finitude's Score: Essays for the End of the Millennium (1994). 
It would have been difficult indeed to pass over this piece
once I read this sentence: "Philosophy's invasion of literature took place
when the border patrol was out having a cigarette." These excerpts for
the most part loosely address the rhetoric of contamination used to circumscribe
the events of philosophy's supposed fall from the pristine ivory towers
(de Man and Heidegger). As Ronell notes, one of the dreams of the academy
is to contain the infection and leakage by "shutting down the flow."

**INTRODUCTION**

World War II ended in 1945, but is still in the news. This course offers the
opportunity to examine both the war, a war which defined many of our present
cultural, political and economic realities, and the present era, a period
still struggling to put to rest many of the legacies from events that ended
over fifty years ago.

By focusing on both era, this course offers an opportunity to examine global
conditions during and after the war and to make connections to and comparisons
with current conditions. The classroom environment will allow all students to
recreate the war years and empowering them to become active participants in
the learning process by expanding interactive activities to include technology
in both presentation and research.

e-CAMPUS - BLACKBOARD

This class will also us Blackboard as an instructional tool. Additional class

**PROGRAM OBJECTIVES**

This Learning Community will focus on the World War II (1941 - 45), primarily
in terms of United States involvement. We will examine both the causes and the
consequences of the conflict. The War influenced all segments of American life
in some very unexpected ways and continues to affect us today. The class
design will help present day students to experience some of what their
predecessors endured. This course seeks to give the student the opportunity to
interpret the early twentieth century and events leading to World War II, to
make connections with the present, and to form some opinions about the future.

**ASSIGNMENTS**

**Weekly Letters**  
Each week you will be required to send the class a Vmail letter. The subject
matter will reflect the topic for the week as described in your class
calendar, and must be written from your  "alter ego's" point of view. In other
words how would he or she describe what was going on in their lives during
that time period. You may address the letter to anyone your "alter ego" could
have known. Those of you in "combat zones" will have to get very creative in
your letter writing so as not to compromise "national wartime security."

The letters are due every Friday. You must post your letter via the Blackboard
student Email feature. **_See theWeekly Letter Topic and Date Calendar in the
syllabus._**

**Biography**  
At the start of the semester each of you will select a [biographical
sketch](mcharactr.htm) of a person who could have lived in the United States
in December of 1941. The choice will be made by a random drawing. You must
then "complete" the "life" drawn. Each biography will contain a brief
description of the person, including sex, age, some home town information,
occupation if relevant, family connections, and other information to get you
started. It is your assignment to bring that "life" "up to date."

To complete the biography you must fashion historical possibilities for your
"alter ego's" life before December 1941 and after September 1945. The finished
biography can either detail your person's life or one of his descendants. You
must include significant political and historical events which could have
affected your persona. The information gathered to complete the biography can
and will be used in classroom discussions and for writing the "weekly
letters."

The biography must be typed and double-spaced and must include a complete
bibliography listing your sources. You must consult at least ten outside
sources with thirty percent of these from internet research. Use information
gathered from individual research, assigned readings, class lectures, and
guest speakers to bring your person from December 1941 to December 2001. You
should also be able to find several "experts" who lived through the era. Talk
to them; listen to them; share their experiences with other members of the
class if their information fits someone else's biography.

The biographies will not be accepted late, except in unusual circumstances,
and only with the advance approval of either instructor. They must be typed
double spaced and will organized using standard English grammar. The Center
for Independent Study (CIS) room M216 is available to help you perfect your
paper, but not to write it for you. We further encourage you to develop word-
processing skills if you do not already have them. The student computer lab is
a possible source of help. **_See the class calendar for the due dates_.**

**Scrap Book**  
All students will be required to keep a  "scrap book". Think of it as an
"illustrated wartime journal." The scrap book can contain class hand-outs such
as the 'newspapers,' your weekly 'letters' and other memorabilia such as
photos. The scrap book can be kept in a 3-ring binder. In addition to weekly
"letters" and photos, the scrap book can contain any other material you feel
important. In addition you will use the BlackBoard student personal web page
as part of your scrap book. You can post material and images you feel tell us
about your character. The scrap books will be reviewed periodically. **_See
Class Calendar for due date._**

**Writings related to Novels and Short Stories** **  
** A series of short writings related to the class Novels and Short Stories
will be assigned when each work is read and discussed in class **.**

**Interview with a Survivor**  
Each of you must interview someone who was alive during the World War II years
and was old enough at the time to remember events of the era. (Someone at
least 60 years old today) The person interviewed could have lived anywhere, it
need not be an American.

You may ask any question which interests you, but the completed interview must
contain the answers to the following four questions:

  1. What do you remember about the War?

  2. What event is most vivid in your memory? Why?

  3. Looking back over the last 50+ years -- do you think of W.W.II as a "Good War"?

  4. What do the young people of today need to learn that you learned because you lived during the War?

**Your completed interview must be presented in _ESSAY FORM, TYPED AND DOUBLE
SPACED_ , using clear and concise standard English grammar, Length: 750 - 1000
words. See Class Calendar for Due Date.**

**The Monograph** **  
The final class writing project will be the production of a class Monograph.
This publication will contain some of the "survivor" interviews and related
student biographical writings. The English instructor will assist the students
in layout and publication design using PageMaker and related software. The
monograph will be published both electronically on our webpage and in hard
copy.**

**Small Group Projects**  
During the semester you will have the opportunity to complete two small group
projects designed to help you experience everyday life during the war years.
More detailed information about this assignment with specific criteria will be
provided during the semester. The two small presentations are 1. A Bond Rally,
and 2. An [USO show](http://www.uso.org/). More detailed descriptions of these
two presentations will be provided for the students. _**See class calendar for
due dates.**_ ****

**Final Group Victory Celebrations**  
December 10, and 12 2001 are your **V-E and V-J Days**. Students will plan
their won celebrations, in lieu of a final exam. The class will be divided
into  "Theaters of Operations" by the 8th week of class. Each "theater" group
is responsible for organizing a group presentation which celebrates the end of
the war in Europe and in the Pacific, and which reflect the possibilities and
realities for the fifty years which followed. The presentations may include
music, art work, film (you can use video), and dance. Anything goes; be
creative.

**Service Learning**  
This learning community is a global studies class and has a service learning
component. You may complete your service learning hours volunteering for
organizations that deal with any of the issues related to your character and
America's experience in World War II. You must complete at least 15 hours of
service, and the reflection activity.

You must register with the service learning office (C274) by September 28,
2001. The service learning coordinator has the list of approved sites:
American Red Cross, VA Hospital, Senior Citizen Centers, Holocaust Center,
Nursing Homes and the USO.

You must complete your hours by November 28, 2001 and return the evaluation,
time sheet and 750-word reflection essay to the service learning office by the
first week in December.

Your 750-word reflection essay must describe your volunteer service related to
your character and his/her experience during World War II.

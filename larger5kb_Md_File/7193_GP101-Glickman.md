_This is the foundation course for Concentrators (Haverford) and Minors (Bryn
Mawr) in the Bi-College Africana Studies Program.._

**Course Description:**

While largely an historically-oriented introduction to African societies,
cultures, and political economies, this course also seeks to offer some
perspective on the reconstructions of Africa's human experiences. We discuss
the post-colonial present, exploring socioeconomic transformations and
continuities, as well as contemporary struggles over authority, autonomy and
access to resources. Texts are various, including scholarly analysis, first-
person narratives, fiction, and a number of films and videos. With two
instructors, we will break into smaller discussion groupings.

The instructors' field work reflects different geographic regions in Africa;
students will be encouraged to gather information about several countries and
share information with others. Students will be able to extend their studies,
e.g,, "specialize" in one or two countries, and explore further into Africana
in a final research paper or annotated bibliography.

The course is suitable for first year students but is open to all students who
want some exposure to Africa's past and present, as well as to the study of
Africa in its cultural and social manifestations. The course raises questions
explored in further depth in other courses offered in the Bi-College Africana
Concentration.

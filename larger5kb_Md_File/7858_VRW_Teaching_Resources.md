Few things are more helpful in planning a course than seeing how others have
laid out similar courses. Sharing syllabi is one of the most fruitful uses of
the Web, and a number of Victorianists have made course plans available online
for the benefit of both students and colleagues. If you would like to
contribute a syllabus for posting here, either as a link to a website or as a
text file, please get in touch.

A variety of additional materials, many of which are especially suited for use
by primary and secondary school teachers, can be found below under [Other
Teaching Resources](teaching.html#other). Again, if you'd like to contribute
additional materials like these we'd be glad to have them.

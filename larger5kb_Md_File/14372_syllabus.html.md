[READING LIST 6](readinglist6.html)

May 14-22:    FINALS WEEK -- _student minisymposium_ \-- projects due  


_Requirements & Grading_:

(1/3)  Participation.  Do the reading, come to each class and lab, and
participate in discussions.  A few homework assignments will also be given.
Systematics Discussion Group:  attendence is requested for this group as well
-- it includes other faculty and older students but complements our course
well.

(1/3)  Quizzes.  Two equally-weighted, one-hour quizzes will be given, that
emphasize problem solving and conceptual understanding.

(1/3)  Project.  This will be a substantive, comparative analysis of data from
a group of the student's choice (with approval of the instructors; we
encourage the study of thesis or other study groups).    Based on phylogenetic
trees (whether self-generated or from the literature), the project should
apply all appropriate comparative methods to evaluate several types of
comparative questions.  There should also be a rigorous critique of previous
comparative literature on the organismal group of choice.  A written report
will be turned in during finals week, in the form of a professional journal
publication, that is, with an introduction (containing the literature review
and critique), materials and methods section, results (using summary figures
-- no raw data), and a discussion (being sure to compare results from the
different methodologies applied, and to reach some biological conclusions).
We will schedule a minisymposium at the end of the term where students can
give a short presentation of their results.

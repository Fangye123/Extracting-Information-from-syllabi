###  Course Description

An introduction to computer architecture and hardware design. Emphasis on
computer design techniques from a hardware perspective. Numerous examples
drawn from recent microprocessors ([Intel,](http://www.intel.com/)
[Motorola,](http://www.mot.com/) [MIPS,](http://www.sgi.com/MIPS/)
[ARM](http://www.arm.com/)). Design problems teach and use hardware
description languages (VHDL, Verilog) and assembly languages (680x0, SPIM).

**Topics:** Computer abstractions, history and technology, design methodology
and CAD tools, VLSI, programmable logic, performance evaluation, instruction
set architectures, computer arithmetic, pipelining, memory systems,
interfacing, parallel processing. Hardware description languages and assembly
languages.

**Grading** : Homework and programming assignments (40%), two midterm exams
(20% each), and a final exam (20%).

**Computer Requirements** : PC with Web access

**Prerequisite** : A basic course in Digital Design (ECE 221, BC320A, or
equivalent)

**Textbook:** _Computer Architecture and Organization_ , J. Hayes, McGraw-
Hill. 3rd edition, 1998, ISBN 0-07-027355-3. There will also be additional
readings from the academic, industrial and popular literature and various Web
reading assignments. These will all be announced in class with links and
bibliographic information provided on this Web page.

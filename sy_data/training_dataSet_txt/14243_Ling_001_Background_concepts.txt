        001     Background concepts




Today we'll cover some basic ideas that underly work in linguistics,
to help you understand the approach to language that we'll be
taking in this course.

What is language?
The word "language" is used in many different ways.
For most linguists, language is the pattern
of human speech, and -- what most distinguishes linguistics
from the everyday use -- the (implicit) systems
that speaking and listening rely on.
Other phenomena come to be called "language" because
of more or less close connections or analogies
to this central case: writing, sign languages, computer languages,
the language of dolphins or bees. The ordinary-language meaning
of the word reflects this process of extension from a speech-related
core.
Notice the range of meanings in
this dictionary entry:


[lan·guage]


1.
a.
Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as
      voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols.


 
b.
Such
      a system including its rules for
      combining its components, such as
      words.


 
c.
Such
      a system as used by a nation, people, or other distinct community;
      often contrasted with dialect.


2.
a.
A
      system of signs, symbols, gestures, or rules used in communicating:
      the language of algebra.


 
b.
Computer Science
       A system of symbols and rules used for communication with
      or between computers.


3.
 
Body
      language; kinesics.


4.
 
The
      special vocabulary and usages of a scientific, professional,
      or other group: "his total mastery of screen language
      -- camera placement, editing -- and his handling of actors"
      (Jack Kroll)


5.
 
A
      characteristic style of speech or writing: Shakespearean language.


6.
 
A
      particular manner of expression: profane language; persuasive
      language.


7.
 
The
      manner or means of communication between living creatures other
      than humans: the language of dolphins.


8.
 
Verbal
      communication as a subject of study.


9.
 
The
      wording of a legal document or statute as distinct from the spirit.



American
      Heritage Dictionary, 4th ed.


Note that the phenomena named by the extended
senses are quite different from one another.

Writing is a system of transcription
  for speech.
  Sign languages used by the Deaf
  are an expression of the same underlying human capabilities as
  spoken language, but in a different medium (gesture rather than
  sound).
  Computer languages are artificial
  systems with some formal analogies (of debatable significance)
  to the systems underlying human speech.


The central role of spoken language, as seen by the
first definition in the dictionary entry, is also reflected by
the source of the equivalent word in various
languages. One common strategy is simply to use the word
tongue to express the concept
"language": it's one of that organ's most obvious functions
in modern humans.

French langue

source of English language
    as well
  
Spanish lengua
Greek glossa
Russian jazyk
Irish teanga
Hebrew lâshôn
Hausa harshèe

a Chadic language of Nigeria and Niger
  
and of course English tongue!

Another typical source is a word related to a verb such as
speak or say,
the basic linguistic act; or a noun meaning speech
or word(s), what language
consists of.

German Sprache

cf. sprechen "to speak"
  
Dutch taal

related to English tale

Sanskrit bhâSâ

cf. bhâS- "speak"
  
Mandarin Chinese yû (yán)

also "talk; words, speech"
  
Japanese kotobá

also "word"
  
Korean mal

also "words, speech"
  
Hawaiian 'ôlelo

also "to say"
  
Alsea yul

also "to speak"; a native language of Oregon
  
Kashaya cahno

also "to utter" and "word"; a native
    language of California
  

The core of the field of linguistics
has always been the analysis of spoken linguistic
structure, and this course will introduce the basic concepts
of this disciplinary core. However, there's a lot of intellectual,
practical and human interest in other aspects of the study of
language, and we'll mention these as well when it's appropriate. 

What's a dialect?
In common parlance, "dialect" implies a nonstandard
variety of a language. This can be seen in the first definition
below, which uses "language" for the standard variety.
(Cf. definition 1c for "language" above.)


[di·a·lect]


1.
a.
A
      regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation,
      grammar, or vocabulary, especially a variety of speech differing from the standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it
      exists: Cockney is a dialect of English.


 
b.
A
      variety of language that with other
      varieties constitutes a single language
      of which no single variety is standard: the dialects of Ancient
      Greek.


2.
 
The
      language peculiar to the members of a group, especially in an
      occupation; jargon: the dialect of science.


3.
 
The
      manner or style of expressing oneself in language or the arts.


4.
 
A
      language considered as part of a larger family of languages or
      a linguistic branch. Not in scientific use: Spanish and French
      are Romance dialects.



American
      Heritage Dictionary, 4th ed.


For linguists, however, no one actually speaks an entire "language";
rather, every utterance occurs in some (social
and geographical) dialect of a language.

Different dialects are mutually intelligible
  varieties of a language.
  Different languages are not mutually
  intelligible with one another.

Nonstandard dialects lack prestige, but not logic or communicative
function. A dialect may be socially stigmatized, just like a particular
word or usage may be; but that says nothing about its linguistic
status.

Beliefs about language
Attitudes toward dialects bring up the fact that linguists
and laypeople often have different views toward linguistic issues.
There are plenty of valid controversies
about language. Some questions are entirely political:

should governments try to accommodate speakers of minority
  languages?
  how important is it to maintain rigorous standards of usage?
  is it bad to borrow words from another languages rather than
  inventing native ones?

Other questions are factual, though
they have immediate practical consequences:

does bilingual education work?
  what are the consequences of oral education for deaf children?
  to what extent can ordinary citizens understand legal contracts?
  how well do computer speech recognition systems work?

Still other questions are mainly interesting to those who care
about language itself:

are Korean and Japanese derived from the same ancestral language?
  how much of linguistic structure is an innate faculty of
  the brain, and how much emerges from the experience of communication?

Reasonable and informed people can and do disagree about these
and innumerable other linguistic issues. Particular arguments
may be illogical, or particular claims may be false, as in any
debate, but our state of knowledge leaves room for a range of
opinions.

On the other hand, there are some disagreements
about language where one side is just wrong, as wrong as
those who believe that the
Earth is flat or that it was created out of nothing in 4004 BCE.
These include plenty of misconceptions
about language among otherwise reasonable people, simply
because they have never really learned how language works.

Non-standard dialects are less logical than standard dialects.
  Languages degrade over time.
  The language that you speak determines the way you think.

In this course we'll see why these myths are, in fact, provably
wrong. For more examples, see The
sci.lang FAQ.

"Grammar"
When beginning the study of linguistics, it's important to
understand what linguists normally mean
by the word grammar. The following distinction is
crucial.
Prescriptive grammar: Rules of proper usage that distinguish
"good" grammar from "bad" grammar. An example
according to this perspective:

Good:
  
He doesn't know.

Bad:
  
He don't know.


The perceived problem with #2, of course, is that verbs in
standard English generally require the agreement suffix -(e)s
when the subject is third person singular, i.e. does rather
than do.
(Not all verbs do this, however: Even in standard English,
so-called modal verbs such as can, will, should,
etc. never take this agreement suffix. So clearly subject-verb
agreement is not necessary for the language to function! Many
languages dispense with it entirely, such as Swedish and Chinese.)

Descriptive grammar: What native speakers know about their language
in order to make use of it. A similar example according to this
perspective:

Grammatical (depending on dialect, style, etc.):
  
He doesn't know.
He don't know.

Ungrammatical (regardless of style):
  
*He not know.
*He known't.
*Not know he.


(The asterisk means "ungrammatical"
in the linguistic sense, i.e. inconsistent with the native speaker's
knowledge and use of the language.)
For a linguist, the sentences in #1 both illustrate a fundamental
property of English, called do-support:
when most verbs take the negative word not, they require
addition of the verb do because
the main verb is not permitted to bear the negation itself.

The same thing happens in questions:
Do you know them?
  *Know you them?
Compared to this rather odd and interesting restriction --
it's unknown in most languages -- the question of whether or not
the agreement suffix -(e)s is present seems quite
boring from a scientific point of view.

It's often said that nonstandard dialects are inferior to the
standard dialect (usually called "language" in this
context) because they are less logical,
or simplified versions of the standard.
In fact, the rules by which nonstandard dialects work are often more logical or more complex than
those of standard dialects.
An example of greater logic:

The nonstandard reflexive pronouns hisself,
  theirselves use the possessive pronoun just
  like myself, yourself, ourselves do.


 
my
      hat
myself


 
your
      hat
yourself


 
his
      hat
hisself


 
her
      hat
herself


 
our
      hats
ourselves


 
your
      hats
yourselves


 
their
      hats
theirselves



Standard himself, themselves
  irregularly use the object pronoun form in two (or three) instances.


 
my hat
see me
myself


 
your hat
see you
yourself


 
his
hat
see him
himself


 
her hat
see her
herself


 
our hats
see us
ourselves


 
your hats
see you
yourselves


 
their
hats
see them
themselves


An example of greater complexity:

A nonstandard double negative
  (I don't see nothing) is actually the agreement
  with the negative marker not
  modifying entire clause.
When the subject of the sentence needs to take this copied
  negation, the order is reversed,
  since the not has
  to occur to the left of the agreeing word.

Can't nobody hold me down.
    *Nobody can't hold me down.
    *Nobody can hold me down. (ungrammatical
    in this dialect)
If necessary, ain't is added as a kind of negative
  support (similar to standard do-support).

Ain't nobody saw me.
    *__ Nobody saw me. (ungrammatical
    in this dialect)
By the way, many "standard" languages use double
  negatives all the time, including French, Spanish, and Russian.

I don't see nothing.
Je ne vois rien.
No veo nada.
Nichevo ne vizhu.


Arbitrary correctness
For the most part, judgments about what type of language is
"right" and what type is "wrong" is an accident of history. The following example
illustrates how arbitrary it can be at times.
Richard Faust, in Columbia Magazine, 11/83, points out
that there is a historical tendency for
the -ed ending to drop in commonly used terms that
start out as phrases of the form Verb-ed Noun:



Newer (reduced) Form

Older (full) Form


 
 



skim milk

skimmed milk



ice cream

iced cream



popcorn

popped corn



roast beef

roasted beef



wax paper

waxed paper


 
 



ice tea

iced tea


 
 



whip cream

whipped cream



cream corn

creamed corn


Many of these terms are now standard
without the -ed, such as ice cream, and they
sound odd in the older form. For example, Mr. Burns on "The
Simpsons" is known for his old-fashioned way of talking,
as illustrated by the use of -ed in places where it has
generally been abandoned.



"I feel like such a free spirit, and I'm really enjoying
      this so-called ... iced cream."
 
    




Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons
      Episode 1F05,
      Bart's Inner Child


Other phrases have not achieved this status yet, and sound
distinctly informal without -ed, such as cream corn.
But in linguistic structure, they are identical;
the relative status depends not on "logic" or "grammatical
correctness" in any meaningful sense, but rather on what
has achieved social acceptability.
Here's a current example. I have noticed lately that CD's and
DVD's are often sold in box sets
rather than boxed sets, though
both terms are common. Two web searches on Google,
a year apart, found evidence of an increasing preference for "box
set":



January
      2001
January
      2002


"box
      set"
144,000
      hits
= 59%
333,000
      hits
= 66%


"boxed
      set"
98,700
      hits
= 41%
172,000
      hits
= 34%


I personally find the phrase box set rather odd -- I
expect to see "a set of boxes" -- but clearly many other
speakers of the language have a different point of view. Either
term has ample precedent in English (skim milk, creamed
corn); I just haven't gotten used to this particular phrase
yet.
Given the usual trend, and the preference reflected in the
web search, box set
is likely to win out. I'll just have to get used to it,
as others in the past had to get used to ice cream when
they had grown up saying iced cream. Those who don't adjust
will eventually sound like Mr. Burns.

It's instructive to think of attidutes
toward language usage as a kind of fashion.




Some styles are hopelessly outdated.
Speaking today in Elizabethan English, such as asking your
      roommate Hast thou bought the detergent?,
      would be absurd.
    





Other styles are appropriate today,
      if not in every circumstance.
Whom did you see? is good, but
      formal, modern English.
It would be silly to ask your friend, Whom
      did you see at the frat party?









Still other styles are complete fantasy.
Similarly, some standards of usage have no basis in English
      grammar, such as the prohibition on split
      infinitives.
(This prohibition was based on the fact that
      a Latin infinitive is a single word, e.g. amare. Since
      Latin was consider the "ideal" language, the silly
      conclusion was that English two-word infinitives such as to
      love should be treated as if they were one word as well!)



Importantly, however, particular styles are appropriate
for some contexts but not for others -- depending on whether
you're accepting an Oscar, chatting on a talk show, or battling
evil.









Similarly, you have to adopt different
speaking styles -- and different grammatical usages --
depending on the situation, audience, and purpose of communication.
None of these is necessarily "better" than the others
from a linguistic point of view, but one style will usually be
the most appropriate in any given
circumstance.

Changing fashions
Linguists like to poke fun at prescriptivists by citing some
historical objections that are hard to understand
today. This is a bit unfair, since of course the examples
are selected from cases where complaint and ridicule failed to
stem the tide of change. One might also cite a set of linguistic
innovations that died out instead of taking over. On the other
hand, people generally feel compelled to speak out against a particular
usage just in case it is spreading.
In 1837, the Englishman Captain Frederick Marryat ridiculed
the following American usages, which all seem perfectly
reasonable today (though some, especially stoop, do retain
a certain informal character).


 
fix
instead of 
prepare


 
strike
 
attack


 
great
 
splendid


 
right
      away
 
at
      once


 
stoop
 
porch


In books like Words and Their Uses (1870) and
Everyday English (1880), American Richard Grant White objected
to

"words that are not words,
  ... a cause of great discomfort
  to all right thinking, straightforward people."
His examples of "non-words" included:

reliable  (1850)
  telegraph  (1794)
  donate  (1845, U.S.)
  jeopardize  (1828, though once
  in 1646)
  gubernatorial  (1734 and 1809,
  both in U.S.)
These were relatively new creations
at the time (as indicated by first recorded uses shown), and thus
did not have the level of acceptance they do today -- since they're
quite well established now.

In 1828, Noah Webster wrote the following about jeopardize:

"This is a modern word used by respectable writers in
    America, but synonymous with jeopard, and therefore useless."
Now it's the shorter word that's useless, or rather unused.
In fact, while well attested from 1374-1654, jeopard
  was already marked obsolete in Samuel Johnson's dictionary of
  1755. Vesey said this about jeopard in 1841:

"it is quite out of use," and its attempted revival
    "indicates rather a spirit of research than good taste."

White also objects to words that are
really words, but are "constantly abused": 

 

Good
Bad
Comments


pitcher
jug
 


remainder
balance
 


overtake
catch
 


earth
dirt
"dirt means
      filth, and primarily filth of the most offensive kind."


leading
      article
editorial
 


wharf
dock
"docks must
      be covered"


send
transmit
 


oversee
supervise
 


condemn
repudiate
 


home
residence
 


recover
recuperate
 


killed
executed
"a perversion"


settle
locate
"insufferable"


convince
persuade
"vulgar"


good
splendid
"coarse"


jewels
jewelry
"of very low
      caste"


?
caption
"laughable
      and absurd"


iced
      cream
ice
      cream
(remember Mr.
      Burns?)


Note that Marryat and White, only 33 years apart though on
opposite sides of the Atlantic, have quite different views regarding
the use of spendid. Also,
both verbs convince and persuade are perfectly acceptable
now, but prescriptivists require convince that but persuade
to.
Again, these perspectives are essentially arbitrary. You certainly
have to pay attention to the prevailing standards in order to
use language in a way that will be considered "standard"
or prestigious, but the details themselves are a
matter of fashion.

HISTORY OF MEXICO



ADVISORY NOTE: This syllabus and all other study aids provided enrollees in
History 533.05 are subject to change at the discretion of the instructor for

COURSE DESCRIPTION: History 533.05 offers an examination of the primary
features of the history of the Mexican people from pre-historic times to the
1990's. Emphasized in the lecture-discussion sessions and the written
exercises which compose the course are the cultural origins - European,
Amerindian and African - of the Mexicans, their turbulent 19th and 20th
century experiences, and their twentieth century art, literature, music and
thought. Provided in the content of the course are opportunities to develop
analytical, critical and communication skills, and a fund of basic knowledge
about the Mexicans.

History 533.05 is scheduled for two hour sessions twice weekly, Tuesdays and
Thursdays.



COURSE REQUIREMENTS: Enrollees in History 533.05 are expected to attend
regularly, and to participate fully in, lecture-discussion meetings of the
course ( _Note:_ Three unexcused absences will reduce the grade earned by an
enrollee in the course by at least one letter). Participation in discussion
will be evaluated and graded. Enrollees are expected to read the text
assignments cited in this syllabus, and to use that reading in discussion and
in the preparation of two papers and a final examination. Assignments must be
completed by the date (s) specified in the schedule below. Late assignments
may not be accepted; if they are accepted a penalty may be assessed against
the grade earned on each. Guidelines for the preparation of the two papers and
the final examination are included in this syllabus.



GRADES: Final grades will be assigned to enrollees on the basis of performance
in discussion (25%), and the quality of the two papers (25% each) and the
final examination (25%) prepared by each. The scale employed in factoring
grades is as follows: A+=99-100, A=92-98, A-=90-91, B+=88-89, B=82-87,
B-=80-81, C+=78-79, C=72-77, C-=70-71, D+=68-69, D=60-67, D-=58-59, F=0-57.

GUIDELINES: REQUIRED PAPERS AND FINAL EXAMINATION  

GENERAL  

Two papers and a final essay examination are required of enrollees in History
533.05. For stylistic guidance in the preparation of all three, two of the
works recommended by the Department of History may be consulted, i.e., Kate L.
Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_ (Fifth Edition) and Joseph M. Williams,
_Style_ (Fourth Edition). The papers (no more than ten pages and no fewer than
seven pages in length) are to be typed, double spaced and with sufficient
right and left margins (1 "to 1 1/2") to allow for comments. These assignments
are due as indicated below.  

**FIRST PAPER DUE OCTOBER 13, 1997**  

The first paper will treat the Spanish conquest of the Aztecan state and its
immediate neighbors as recorded in Cortes' _Letters From Mexico_ and in _The
Broken Spears_ as edited by Miguel-Leon Portilla. Its foci should be the most
significant and interesting dimensions of the conquest as the enrollee author
sees it. Her or his paper should provide an explication of the conquest, and
its meaning and significance in the context of Mexico's history and culture.
Use of the Leonard, Meyer and Paz texts, as appropriate, and the lecture-
discussion materials for the course must be evident in each author's
discussion.  

**SECOND PAPER DUE NOVEMBER 13, 1997**  

The second paper will address Emiliano Zapata and the Zapatistas in the so-
called Mexican Revolution as portrayed by John Womack, Jr., in his _Zapata and
the Mexican Revolution_ , i.e., the role played by both, their primary
successes and failures, and the significance of both. Use of the Meyer and Paz
texts and the lecture-discussion materials for the course must be evident in
each author's essay.  

**FINAL EXAMINATION : WEEK OF DECEMBER 8, 1997**  

The final examination for the course will compose an essay addressing the
subject matter, meaning and significance of two of the essays (chapters) in
Irving Leonard's _Baroque Times in Old Mexico . . ,_ and two of the essays
(chapters) in Octavio Paz's _The Labyrinth of Solitude and Other Writings._
The essays treated will be the most significant and/or interesting of those
included in the Paz and Leonard collections as the enrollee author sees it.
His or her essay should provide an explanation of the significance and/or
interest quality of the four essays (comparing them with the other essays in
the two collections) as well as an explication of the subject matter and
meaning of each in the contest of Mexico's history and culture. Evident in
each author's discussion must be use of the other texts (as pertinent) and
lecture-materials for the course.  



GRADUATE ENROLLEE REQUIREMENTS  

Enrollees earning graduate credit for History 533.05 will be expected fo
fulfill the requirements for all enrollees as outlined in course syllabus, and
to prepare a critically interpretive paper treating Irving Leonard's _Baroque
Times in Old Mexico . . ._ That paper is to be of no more than fifteen
typewritten, double-spaced pages in length (no fewer than twelve pages).
Considered are to be Leonard's sources, their extent and general character;
his thesis; and his arguments about colonial Mexican society, literature, and
thought. Finally, graduate enrollees are asked to include several concluding
paragraphs in which they evaluate Leonard's work from their particular
perspective, i.e., is he fair in his analysis, is his work interesting, is it
well written and convincing, do his characterizations and conclusions appear
valid, and why or why not?  

Final grades will be assigned to those enrolling in History 533.05 for
graduate credit on the basis of performance in discussion (20%), and the
quality of the three papers (20% each) and the final examination (20%)
prepared by each. The scale employed in factoring grades is that found in the
"Grades" paragraph on page one of this syllabus.

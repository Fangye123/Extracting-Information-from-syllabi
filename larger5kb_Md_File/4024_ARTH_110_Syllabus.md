**Catalog Description** :

Discussion of the major trends in art style and history from c. 1300 through
the 20th century, with emphasis on development of visual acuity and ability to
recognize and discuss major trends in the history of art.



**Purposes of the Course:**

The visual arts represent one of the principal vehicles of human
communication. One purpose of this course is to acquaint you with the basic
skills and vocabulary of critical and technical terms that will enable you to
talk intelligibly and intelligently about works of art. Another purpose of
this course is to introduce you to some of the major monuments of art from the
Renaissance to the Modern period. It is hoped that you will leave the course
with an awareness of the basic artistic periods and an understanding of the
variety of ways humans have expressed themselves in the visual arts.



**Requirements:**

1) You will be responsible for material presented in class and for the
readings in the text book.

2) Classes will be conducted in a lecture/discussion format. I want to involve
you as directly as possible into the discussions of the works of art. I expect
you to come to class prepared to participate in the class discussion.

3) You are expected to review the web site connected to this course. Here you
will find electronic versions of the class hand-outs. The Slide Lists are
supplemented with pictures of as many of the images in the course as possible.
You are also encouraged to explore the supplementary material and links that
are included on many of these slide lists. The dates for quizzes and exams and
other assignments will be posted at "[ARTH 100
Assignments:](http://www.oneonta.edu/~farberas/arth/ARTH110/ARTH110_ASSIGNMENTS.HTML)"

4) Although no fixed grade will be given for attendance, your success in the
course is dependent on regular attendance. I do hold open the option of taking
attendance on an intermittent basis to gain a sense of your involvement.

5) 1/4 of your final grade will be based on your performance on a series of
quizzes. I plan to give a total of 5 quizzes over the course of the semester,
4 of these will be announced in advance, while the remaining one will be a
"pop" quiz. Your final grade will be based on the average of your 4 best
quizzes.

The quizzes will be multiple choice questions based on material presented in
previous classes, in your reading, and on the web-site.

6) 3/4 of your grade in the course will be based on your performance on 3
examinations. The exams will be composed of short answers plus one short
essay. The short answers will consist largely of multiple choice questions
based on material presented in class and/or your readings. The essay will
consist of a comparison of major works of art chosen to document major issues
in Art History. Your answers will be evaluated primarily on the basis of your
assessment of the art historical significance of the comparisons.
Demonstration of a mastery of the language of art history and the coherence of
your essays will also be significant factors.

The essays will be based on review questions which will appear on the slide
lists handed out for each class. These questions are intended to review major
issues discussed in the lectures, and you are strongly recommended to prepare
your answers to these questions shortly after each class. Pictures of the
works included in these review questions will appear on the web-site. If you
conscientiously study these review questions, you should be adequately
prepared for the examinations.

**No make-up quizzes or exams will be given** , unless you have received my
permission _prior_ to the exam or quiz.



**Text:**

The text for this course is _Gardner's Art Through the Ages_ , 11th edition,
vol 2. It is available at Damascene. You are advised to spend as much time
looking at the illustrations as reading the text. Remember that what Gardner
or I have to say about a work should be considered as a secondary source; the
illustrations are the primary source.

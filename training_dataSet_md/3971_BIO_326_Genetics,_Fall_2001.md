Requirements:

**

  1. 4 examinations, 650 points total (65%). Exams 1, 2 and 3 (150 points each) will be given in the CLAS Testing Center, located in Robinson Hall. Hours are: Friday 9-5, Sunday 3-7. **It is your responsibility to allow sufficient time to complete the exam.** Please do not contact the Testing Center regarding testing dates. You can check their web page for test information at www.cmich.edu/~clas/. Exam 4 (200 points) will be given during the regular final exam period.
  2. Homework and (possibly) quizzes, 100 points (10%). Weekly homework will be assigned, due at the beginning of your lab section. No quizzes are scheduled, but may be given with or without notice.
  3. Laboratory worksheets and reports, 250 points (25%). Note that failing Laboratory means that the best you can earn in the course is a B. Never attending lab means that the best you can earn in the course is a C. Lab is meant to reinforce the concepts from lecture, so if you attend lab and do the work, it will help your final grade.
  4. Consistent class attendance and active participation. May be important for borderline grade cases.
  
**

Course Grades:** Course grades will be based on the following: A 90-100%, B
80-89%, C 70-79%, D 60-69%, E  < 60%. Depending on class performance, these
cutoffs may be adjusted _down_ but not up.  
**

Absences:** Students with 5 unexcused absences will have their course grade
dropped by one letter grade per additional unexcused absence. Students with
extended absences due to illness or other excused reason should contact me
about making up required coursework. The last day to withdraw from class with
an automatic W is 5 PM, Friday, Nov. 2. The final exam will not be given at
any other than the scheduled time. Make-up quizzes and exams will be given
only under extreme personal circumstances (illness, death in the family),
extramural athletic participation, required field trips in other courses, or
employment obligations, and must be approved **_in advance**_. A note from the
appropriate authority must be provided. A grade of Incomplete will be given
only to students who are passing the course and, for some reason of emergency,
fail to complete the course requirements.  
**

Policy on Academic Integrity:** In May 2001, the Central Michigan University
Academic Senate approved the _Policy on Academic Integrity_ which applies to
all university students. Copies are available on the CMU web site at
http://academicsenate.cmich.edu/noncurric.htm, and in the Academic Senate
Office in room 108 of Bovee University Center. All academic work is expected
to be in compliance with this policy.

See also Plagiarism: a brief overview at
http://www.cst.cmich.edu/users/alm1ew/Plagiarism.html if you have questions.
Any plagiarized work or other act of dishonesty will receive a Zero and the
Office of Student Life will be notified. **You are responsible** for
understanding what constitutes plagiarism.  
**

Classroom Civility:** Each CMU student is encouraged to help create an
environment during class that promotes learning dignity, and mutual respect
for everyone. Students who speak at inappropriate times, sleep in class,
display inattention, take frequent breaks, interrupt the class by coming to
class late, engage in loud or distracting behaviors, use cell phones or pagers
in class, use inappropriate language, are verbally abusive, display defiance
or disrespect to others, or behave aggressively toward others could be asked
to leave the class and be subjected to disciplinary action under the _Code of
Student Rights, Responsibilities and Disciplinary Procedures._  
**

Requests for Accommodation:** CMU provides students with disabilities
reasonable accommodation to participate in educational programs, activities or
services. Students with disabilities requiring accommodation to participate in
class activities or meet course requirements should register with the office
Student Disability Services (250 Foust Hall, telephone #517-774-3018, TDD
#2568), and then contact me as soon as possible.  
  
  
**

Course Goals and Expectations**  
**

Purpose:** The purpose of this course is to think biologically about
transmission, molecular, and population genetics.  
**

Key Question:** How do we explain heredity and variation?  
**

Information:** Students will use selected readings of the textbook as a
starting point for thinking about genetics. Students will also generate
simulated and actual laboratory data for genetic analysis.  
**

Skills of Interpretation:** Students will learn how to analyze and interpret
genetic data, from working chapter problems and from laboratory data.  
**

Essential Concepts:** Students will learn to use basic genetic concepts, which
permeate all of biology.  
**

Assumptions:** The fundamental assumption for this course is that university
juniors and seniors have the ability to understand the concepts of genetics
and recognize their importance in all of biology.  
**

Implications:** Students who reason well about genetics should be able to make
connections with other aspects of biology, and better understand genetic
issues in society at large. Students should be better thinkers and problem
solvers after taking this course.  
**

Points of View:** Students will learn that the phenotype is determined by the
genotype, the environment, and developmental noise, and the interactions
between them. Students will examine genetics at the levels of the population,
the organism, and the molecule.

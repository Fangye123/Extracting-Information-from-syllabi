International 
            Fulbright Scholars 



Antonie 
                Dvorakova - Czech Republic
B.A., 
                M.A. in
Psychology 
                from Masaryk University, Brno, Czech Republic. I want to concentrate 
                on Native American Studies. It is my long lasting interest. I 
                have been interested in Native Americans since my teens. After 
                I complete my studies in the U.S. I intend to continue my research 
                activities in the Center for Research of Children, Youth, and 
                Family Social Studies at Masaryk University in Brno and focus 
                on the issues of ethnic Minorities.




Olena 
                Fedyuk - Ukraine
B.A. 
                in Education, personal statement: One of the reasons I decided 
                to apply to the Indigenous Nations Studies program was because 
                of the issues in my own country. It is amazing how much of the 
                knowledge I have learned about the effects of colonization is 
                relevant to the situation we have in the Ukraine. 

                I appreciate learning from other cultures because we each have 
                something valuable to share, knowledge that makes us unique but 
                also unites us. The Center for Indigenous Nations Studies provides 
                a wonderful chance to learn and help improve things in my country. 
                I appreciate this opportunity and all the supportive students 
                and faculty in the program.

  * Selected sections of [**The Evolution of the Concepts of Space and Time**](titlepage.tableofcontents.html), a manuscript by Professors Bradie and Duncan. 
  * Hand-outs on various space and time topics will be provided.

  * A bibliography of some key references will be provided. 

##  Course Objectives:

This course is an introduction to the philosophy and physics of space and
time. Among the topics to be covered are Zeno's paradoxes, the dispute between
Newton and Leibnitz on the nature of space and time, the relationship between
geometry and physics, a survey of the foundations of the theory of the special
theory of relativity, the geometrization of gravitation by Einstein's general
theory of relativity and gravitation. The emphasis is on a discussion of the
conceptual foundations and a tracing of the evolution of the concepts of space
and time from the pre-socratics to the present day. The treatment is
essentially non-mathematical with some inclusion of mathematical concepts
needed to fill out the development. Among the more philosophical issues, we
will examine the relation of models to reality, the role of convention in
scientific theories, questions of evidence and testability of scientific
models, and questions of determinism and causality.

## Requirements for the course:

A knowledge of mathematics at least at the level of high school. Knowing
calculus is a plus. Any further study in mathematics would be helpful, but not
necessarily a requirement.

## Grading:

There will be two term papers. The first will be due on **March 19** and will
cover material from the first half of the course. The second paper will be due
**April 30** and will cover material from the second half of the course. We
will hand out term paper topics at a later date, as well as discuss our
requirements on the content of the papers.

There will be a number of weekly **homework** exercises - one or two problems
that will test your understanding of the materials. These will be distributed
on Thursdays and collected the following Tuesday.

The course grade will be determined from the performance on these two papers
along with an assessment of the student's class participation. You are
expected to attend class regularly and be prepared to discuss the assigned
reading material. The class participation factor may raise your grade but will
not lower it.

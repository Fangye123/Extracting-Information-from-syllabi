**_ _**[![](sml-logo.gif)](http://www.rbc.edu) **TRANSFER GUIDE**   This
Transfer Guide has been developed to assist you in making a smooth transfer
from Richard Bland College to a senior college. The Guide provides transfer
information that may not be available in college catalogues or from any
written source.  

**Although the information on specific colleges was taken from the most
current sources during the summer of 1997, this information is subject to
change. RBC advisors will receive updates of changes as they become available;
therefore, you should verify any information in The Guide with your advisor
before making scheduling decisions.**

**Maximum Transfer Credits:** Most colleges limit the number of credits you
may transfer. Generally, colleges will accept a maximum of one half the total
hours required for a four year degree. You should check the catalogue of each
college on their standards of transfer credit limits.

**Grade Requirements:** A grade of "C" or better will be accepted by most
colleges; "D" grades generally do not transfer.

****** All 299 courses must be individually evaluated.  For this reason, it is
advised that students keep course syllabi.  These will help the college or
university properly evaluate the class.

**Transfer Problems:** Any problem related to transfer should be brought to
the attention of   [Mrs. Tracey Gilchrist ](mailto:tgilchrist@rbc.edu)(804)
862-6263, who serves as the Transfer Coordinator on Campus.

The course meets Mondays, 5:30 to 8:20 in STV 221A.  
Note that 221A is a fancy networked classroom, and we'll put its technology to
regular use.  
We'll also ignore it regularly.

My office hours are Tuesday and Thursday, 2:00 to 3:00 p.m. and whenever my
office door is open. I'm usually on campus every day from 8:00 a.m. to 4:00
p.m., but I'm often in the library, a meeting, or a dense paragraph, so
catching me with an open door is hit-and-miss. However, I'll arrange
appointments at other times if you contact me in advance. Email is best.

Overview

Introduction to Graduate Studies in English entwines four goals. First, the
course will familiarize you with scholarly methods important to success in a
graduate program. What bibliographies are most helpful? How do scholars use
them? How do scholars use critical and other sources? Second, the course will
further develop your writing skills. Pretty much by definition of your having
been admitted to this program, you have substantial writing abilities.
However, certain ways of developing and presenting ideas are privileged in
English studies, and these may differ from strategies in even good
undergraduate programs. A substantial part of earning a graduate degree in any
discipline is learning its professional discourse conventions, and English is
no exception. Third, the course will introduce topics and issues current
within English studies. What are the different fields within this capacious
discipline? What are their histories? How do they relate? What theoretical or
critical perspectives are important? How does one employ them? Fourth, and
perhaps mundanely, the course will familiarize you with the particular
requirements and opportunities within the Illinois State English Studies
graduate program, everything from the nature of the Master's comprehensive
exam to thesis proposals to professional development opportunities.

If this were more truly an Introduction to Graduate Studies in English, we
would divide our time almost equally among literary studies, rhetoric, writing
studies (including creative writing, composition, and technical writing), and
language (linguistics, ESL, and history of the language). But I am slighting
some of those fields. Many of you--but not all--are currently taking or will
take English 402: Introduction to the Composing Process. In that course you'll
develop many of the goals above as applied to rhetoric and composition
studies; for that reason, we will spend less time on those concerns in English
401 than we otherwise ought. Similarly, I will rely on English 341 to provide
a much more thorough introduction to linguistics, another vital area within
English studies, than I will attempt here. We will devote class and project
time to these areas, but not in proportion to their presence within English
studies.



Texts

I've chosen a combination of "primary" and "secondary" readings, a seemingly
quaint distinction that, along with "creative" and "not creative" and a bunch
of other oppositions ("reading" and "writing," even), constitutes one of the
problematically fertile binaries of English studies. I've chosen the primary
texts mainly to give us a category of works with which we can practice
talking, writing, and applying various theoretical perspectives. Except for
scant nods to gender and genre, I've not at all tried to "cover" even a
fingernail of the texts one might properly study as an English graduate
student. I will have us deal with two pools of texts, several from the 19th
century and several from today, the former with a rich critical tradition, the
latter absent the consolations of critical history. _Gatsby_ is its own pool,
or rather a lake, a work so thoroughly insinuated into the American literature
that it can function both as object and lens of scholarly practices, much like
the Lady of Shallot's mirror.

A semester-long resource-building project

As an ongoing project, we will create a web page of resources for English
studies scholars at Illinois State. Although I'll serve as project manager
(and occasionally taskmaster) together we'll plan several facets of this page.
Each of you will create two web pages, at least one for a general area within
English (for example, 18th century literature or classical rhetoric or history
of the English language), the other possibly for a more specific topic (for
example, Jane Austen, new historicism, cognitive linguistics). We'll link
these pages off a single main page.

Now, lest you get too excited, let me include some caveats. First, I won't
presume you've ever made a web page. I'll teach you, with the help of other
knowledgeable folks in the class (some much better versed than I). We'll spend
part of several class meetings on this project. Second, I'm imagining pretty
low-end web pages, pretty much text-based, bereft of all but the most basic
graphics. Design can take up more of our time than is useful in this course,
so we'll slight it. Third, we won't be comprehensive, either in terms of
"covering" all facets of English studies or in terms of covering the
individual topics. In fact, many English studies pages that exist right now on
the web lumber under exhaustiveness. You will have to make and defend
selections.

Along with the pages themselves, you will write explanations and
justifications of your decisions.



Other writing in the course

You'll write frequently, generally, a piece of writing due each week. However,
most of these writings will be in the 3-5 page range. You'll certainly write
longer papers in many of your courses; a 20-page final project is fairly
common around here, and with good reason: that's the low-end limit of articles
submitted for publication. However, I'd like to concentrate on various skills,
and several shorter papers will do that more readily. Writing projects will
include readings of texts (including through various critical lenses),
annotated bibliographies, analyses of discourse conventions of journal
articles, analyses of websites, reactions to and critiques of scholarly
articles, position papers, summaries of scholarship--all, of course,
documented in impeccable MLA format, when appropriate.

Everyone has dispensation from completing one of the weekly paper assignments.
What this means is that you may decide not to complete one of the weekly
papers, and I won't penalize you for it. I've decided all of us could benefit
from having a pressure release valve. Use this dispensation wisely, saving it
perhaps for a week when you're near the end of your rope. I only ask for a
brief note from you that you're exercising your option some particular week.
And of course if you want to take advantage of every writing opportunity, more
power to you.



Exams  
The exams will be patterned after the MA comprehensive exam and serve the main
purpose of alerting you to the format and demands of that test.



Grades  
Exams 10%  
In-class writings; oral and written discussions;  
quizzes; class preparedness, etc.) 15%  
Web project 15%  
Written projects 60%



Absences  
If you miss classes for anything less than perfectly solid reasons (and they
do happen), I'll fret about your abilities to succeed in graduate school. I
will not accept any work due in classes that you miss, and the in-class
portion of your grade will be failing.



Late Work  
Late work has my lowest priority; I get to it only when I'm caught up on other
things, which sometimes may be weeks after you turn it in. I also respond to
late work in the most perfunctory of fashions.



  
**Schedule  
** The schedule below is skeletal; I will flesh it out as the semester
proceeds, and I reserve the right to alter things due to course needs and
opportunities. I will likely bring in additional handouts.

September 11

Have read all of _Gatsby_.  
In Richter, read all the readings in Section 2 (121-234).

Paper 2. On the second day of an introductory class for undergraduate English
majors, I asked the students to mention about a meaningful book they had read,
and then I asked how many others in the class had read that book. Almost all
of them had read _The Great Gatsby_ , including one student who reported
reading it in 5 classes, between high school and college. What are we to make
of this? Why is _The Great Gatsby_ such a frequently assigned text in American
English programs? Answering that question in a 3 to 5-page essay is your
assignment for Paper 2. As you write this paper, I'd like you to present at
least a couple of explanations of the continued popularity of _Gatsby_. Draw
those perspectives from the readings you'll have done to this point in
Richter. I'm not sure that any of those essays directly take up the question
of _Gatsby_ , but you should be able to extrapolate how some of these writers
would address the question. Please include your own judgement of these
perspectives, and if you'd like, offer an argument for why and how we ought to
read this novel. Once again, please bring a disk version as well as a paper
version.

[Examples of Paper 2](paper2examples.html)

September 18

Read pages 235-349 in Richter. Send me, via email, a possible question for
discussion no later than 1:00 p.m. on September 18. No fair having that
question be, "What is something interesting about tonight's reading?" ; ) I'll
post some questions on the class webboard.

Write short paper #3. Four to six pages. For this paper please work with three
pieces of scholarship, each article or chapter length, that deal substantially
with providing a reading of _The Great Gatsby_ or some facet of the novel.
(The pieces you choose might deal with other works, too, but Gatsby should be
an important focus.) One more restriction: one piece should have been
published between 1925 and 1950, one piece between 1950 and 1970, and one
piece after 1985. If you want to collaborate with someone and share sources,
that's perfectly fine and perhaps desirable. I would like you each to write
your own papers, though. One possible bibliographic starting place is the
Fitzgerald Centenary Website at South Carolina,
http://www.sc.edu/fitzgerald/index.html.

Your task is to characterize the scholarly approach of each of these
articles/chapters. A possible beginning question: "What did each scholar
assume was a meaningful way to read the novel? What theory of reading,
interpretation, or literary scholarship seems to lie behind this approach?"
You might focus on the styles of the three different pieces. Do all come at
the work the same way? Is the critic's voice similar across all of them? What
is the proportion of quotation to summary of other critics to writer's
analysis or opinion? These are just some questions to get you started. You'll
have to do some orienting for your readers, since we likely won't have read
the articles.

Some background on the assignment. The assignment I would like to have made
would be to characterize the evolution of literary criticism and scholarly
approaches, as demonstrated in specific scholarly works, from 1925 to the
present. That, of course, would be a preposterous assignment for a brief paper
written over a week's period. Even if I focused the paper on "the evolution of
scholarly approaches to Fitzgerald" that would be way too much to ask. I
settled, then, on a small corner of that project, choosing works published at
different intervals and focusing your attention on them. Mind you, this is an
open investigation. While I have speculations about the trends within
scholarly writing during this period, I haven't done or read a study like this
one. We might be able to compile the 15 papers written for this assignment
and, if everyone happened to select different essays, we might be in a better
position to make claims about trends. Your burden in this paper is more
modest, however. Analyze three scholarly pieces and say something about the
approaches they use.

You've got Five options for paper 4, so choose the one that looks most
interesting to you.

1\. Identify a highly popular novel published the same year that _Gatsby_ was
published, a novel that did not, however, achieve the  "lasting status" that
_Gatsby_ did, by an author who seems similarly to have evaporated. Read the
novel. (Gulp!) Then write a brief paper in which you either, explain a feature
that the novel  "lacked" in achieving canonical status, or explain what makes
the novel, in fact, one worthy for assignment and study. Choosing this latter
course would be, in effect, to aspire to some kind of "rescue" of the work.  
2\. Several in the class (and outside the class!) have found the
representation of women in _Gatsby_ problematic, some to the extent that they
contend the novel shouldn't be assigned. Others might argue that, even if the
women are problematic, the novel ought to be read-if resistantly, rather than
"authorially." (Still others might argue that Fitzgerald, especially in
constructing a louse like Tom Buchanan, was trying ironically to suggest
fuller views of women.) Use some of the theorists we've read in Richter-or
choose some other feminist theorists-to provide a feminist reading of _Gatsby_
, or at least some issues, events, or characters within the novel.
Alternatively: use _Gatsby_ as test case to elucidate the various perspectives
on the appropriate roles and practices of feminist criticism as several of the
writers in Richter would advocate.  
3\. Write a fairly comprehensive (if necessarily brief) overview of the
current criticism of _Gatsby_ , concentrating on what's been written in the
past 15 years. Is there more work to be done on this book, particular issues
or viewpoints that merit further exploration? Or is the book seemingly
exhausted, needing another round of theoretical work to make it "new" again?  
4\. Apply some of the readings about the "new aestheticism" from Richter
(Berube and Levine), plus at least one additional essay on this subject, to
_Gatsby_. How is _Gatsby_ important (or not) from a new aestheticist lens? How
does reading the novel through this viewpoint differ from reading it through
an  "old aestheticist" lens of, say, New Criticism?  
5\. What is an important issue at stake in several of the readings in Richter?
Explore that issue in a paper that, ultimately, argues your own position on
it. Here's your chance to consolidate some ideas for yourself.

Examples of Paper 4

Reading for next class  
Richter, 40-84; 349-398.  
Also browse extensively the "History of English Studies Page" listed on page
399 of Richter's appendix.



October 2

The packet of readings available from Wright printing consists of a little
casebook of criticism on John Keats's "Ode on a Grecian Urn," each of six
critical work representing, according to Donald Keesey in _Contexts for
Criticism_ (Mountain View, CA: Mayfield, 1994), a different theoretical
approach.

For next time read through the packet and come to class prepared to discuss
the different emphases in the critical approaches used to discuss the poem.
Keesey describes them as representing formalism, reader response, mimeticism,
intertextuality, postructuralism, and historicism. I'm less concerned about
these particular terms in our discussion than I am about your sense of how
each critic approaches the poem and how well you can describe those
approaches. What interests them? What argument do they make? How do they make
it?

Then, I'd like you to write a brief paper (3-5 pages) about one of the two
Tennyson poems I've included in the packet. In this writing emulate one of the
critical approaches in the packet; include a separate paragraph describing
what essay you were using as a model, what problems or difficulties you had,
if any, and what you might do if you had more time and space to work on a
fuller essay.

[Examples of paper 5](paper5examples.html)



October 9  
  
Paper 6.



October 16

For October 16, there's no common reading. Your Paper 7 task instead: write a
3-5 page introduction to one of the critical approaches to reading listed
below. But wait. Not just any topic. We'll divvy them up in class tonight. The
audience for this introduction will be other members of the class. Therefore,
please either a) send your final paper to me as a Word email attachment or b)
bring a disk with the paper on it to class on October 16. Three to five pages
is not much space, so this is not the assignment on which to spend lots of
time talking about how impossible it is to define the topic, how stupid
taxonomies are, how reductive definitions are, etc. We'll take all of that as
a given. In fact, you can write "The Usual Disclaimer" at the top of you page
if it makes you feel better, and we'll all know that you're ever more
sophisticated and critical than the ensuing explanations. One further thing
you might do is include a paragraph that sketches how the critical approach
you're explaining might be applied to one of the works we have in common:
_Gatsby_ , the poems, or Our Village. I've included a little bibliography
below. On reserve at Milner for my English 101 class is the Carpenter book. It
has some good introductions to several of these topics and a very good
bibliography. If you're really stuck, contact me for a starting place.

New Criticism  
Formalism and Structuralism  
Poststructuralism and Deconstruction  
Psychoanalytic Criticism  
Rhetorical criticism  
Feminist theory  
Gender Studies and Queer Theory  
Reader Response  
New Historicism  
Hermeneutic criticism and theory  
Textual scholarship  
Cultural studies  
Narrative theory and narratology  
Genre theory  
Marxist criticism



October 23  
**Paper 8** : Your task next week will be to analyze a major academic journal
in a field of English studies that interests you and to share your analysis
with the class, via a 4-5 page writing.

The project will have several steps  
a. Identify an area of English studies that interests you. This part is easy
and entirely your call. History of rhetoric, Victorian literature, creative
nonfiction, ESL, the short story, cognitive linguistics, syntactic studies,
Shakespeare, Conrad, cultural studies, feminist studies, the novel, 18th
century literature, contemporary American literature, etc. etc. etc.  
b. Identify at least a few of the major academic journals in that area.
Notice: focus on scholarly journals, journals that publish criticism and
theory. For this part, you may need to consult with a faculty member, probably
a faculty member other than me, unless you're interested in rhetoric and
composition. Several major journals in writing studies are _College
Composition and Communication, Journal of Advanced Composition, Rhetoric
Review, Composition Studies, College English, Written Communication_.  
c. After browsing the journals you've identified, choose one for your
analysis. Review several issues of the journal so you have a good sense of it.  
d. Draft a paper that does the following:  
introduces the journal to readers who are unfamiliar with it  
characterizes the types of things the journal publishes (topics, approaches,
etc.)  
analyzes at least a couple of recent articles to identify the discourse
conventions of writing in that journal. In other words, treating the articles
you've selected as exemplars, explain what articles in this journal have to do
to be published.  
remember throughout that your readers will be depending entirely on your
analysis, so you'll have to summarize, characterize, quote, etc., with care
and clarity.  
e. Bring both a paper copy and a copy on disk with you to class next week.
We'll build these writings into our website.

[Examples of Paper 8](paper2examples.html)

**Reading:** In the Pushcart Prize volume, read the stories, essays, and poems
on pages 23 (Moody) through 94 (Creeley).



October 30  
1\. Read the essays from the _College English_ Symposium on English Studies.
I'll provide copies.  
2\. Read one story, one poem, one essay from the Pushcart volume. Selections
will be announced in class.  
3\. Browse the contents of the Pushcart volume and select a handful of stories
or poems or plays or some combination that you'd like to recommend that a
group read for November 6.  
4\.  "Paper 9." Instead of a new writing assignment for tonight, please select
at least two papers that you have written for class so far, and prepare them
for linking to the course syllabus. Keep in mind that the syllabus is a public
area that anyone connected to the internet may read. Therefore, feel free to
revise these works so they are in "publishable" shape. Please send these
papers to me as a Word attachment by 3:00 p.m. on Monday, October 30. Note: I
will not grade this papers except to check off that you completed them.
However, if you do some revisions and want to turn in one or more of the
papers as part of your revisions at the end of the semester, you'll be ahead
of the game by doing this work now.

November 6  
1\. During class on October 30, you will have met with a group of students who
are interested in a particular genre or set of genres. Each group will have
decided on at least 4 poems, 4 stories, or 4 essays--or some combination of
these genres--to read before coming to class. In other words, different parts
of the class will have read different things.  
2\. Paper 10. Using as a core the readings you did for part one, write a four
to five page paper. Your topic? Are there any particular editorial values
revealed by the choices of poetry or fiction or nonfiction for this particular
edition of the Pushcart Prizes? If you wish, you may talk about other kinds of
works that were not chosen, but this is optional. Alternative assignment:
discuss affinities between any two genres (fiction and creative nonfiction;
fiction and poetry, poetry and nonfiction) as they are suggested by readings
in the Pushcart volume. The resulting paper might be suggestive about the
current state of literary publishing. (Or it might not.)

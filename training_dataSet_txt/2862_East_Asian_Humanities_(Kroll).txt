This course is an introductlon to the
humanistic concerns and creations of pre-modern China and Japan.
We will study selected aspects of Chinese and Japanese religion,
literature, and art. The focus will be on representative works
and significant developments, not on comprehensive coverage.
Students enrolled in the course should expect to devote
considerable time and energy to the reading and concurrent
imaginative re-creation necessary for engaging themselves with
the varied realities conceived by people who lived long ago and
far from us.
General requirements:
1. Attendance and mindfulness at class lectures
and at least two of the four guest lectures. This will affect
your final grade, so do not imagine that your absence or
inattention will not be noticed, it will!).
2. At least two map quizzes, on dates to be announced.
3. Mid-term exam, Wednesday March 20.
4. Final exam, Thursday May 5, 7:30-10:30 a.m.
There may occasionally be brief quizzes or
short writing assignments during the semester,
Lecture Topics and Schedule of Readings

paraphrase of the readings, For the most part, they shall present
new information related to the topic of the assigned reading.

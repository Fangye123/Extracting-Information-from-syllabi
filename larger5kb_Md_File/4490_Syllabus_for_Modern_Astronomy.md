Modern Astronomy is an introductory survey course for non-science majors, and
will cover topics including the apparent motion of objects in the sky,
planets, comets, meteors, stars, black holes, Einstein's theory of relativity,
and the history and evolution of the universe as a whole. Although the course
is introductory, it will not be easy. Several topics to be covered are
difficult to understand conceptually (for example, the apparent motion of
objects in the sky, how ages of objects in the solar system are determined,
etc). However, your efforts in this course will leave you with a sounder
understanding of the physical world, and improved conceptual skills for
understanding astronomy and science in general.

  * There are no homework assignments associated with the lecture portion of this course. You should, however, read the chapters in the text before we discuss them in lecture. 
  * Study guides for the tests along with past exams are available on the class web page. You should print out the study guide for midterm 1 during the first week of class and refer to it as you read the textbook. 
  * If you are taking the course for 4 semester hours of credit, you are registered for the laboratory, which satisfies the General Education requirement of a natural science laboratory. The lab section meets for two hours per week **starting the second week of the semester** in room 665 or 666 of Van Allen Hall, and attendance is mandatory. Projects in the laboratory consist of taking and analyzing astronomical observations with the Automated Telescope Facility of the University, and use of the graphics capabilities of personal computers to carry out various exercises. **** If you're registered for the lab you must receive a passing grade in the laboratory portion of the course as well as the lecture portion in order to pass the course. 
  * Regular tutorial sessions are held throughout the semester. These sessions are staffed by the teaching assistants assigned to the course. Hours and locations of these tutorial sessions will be posted outside room 666 of Van Allen Hall, and also on the web at [ http://www-astro.physics.uiowa.edu/modern/ ](http://www-astro.physics.uiowa.edu/modern/)
  * One-hour exams will be held in class on October 3 and November 16. 
  * The final will be held on Tuesday December 18 at 4:30. The location of the final will be announced in class towards the end of the semester. 
  * Make-up exams will only be given in extreme circumstances, such as severe illness. 
  * Please bring two number 2 pencils to each exam. 
  * If you are _not_ taking the lab, your grade will be determined by the following scheme: 
    * midterm 1 ---- 25% 
    * midterm 2 ---- 30% 
    * midterm 3 ---- 45% 
  * If you are taking the lab, your lecture grade will be determined according to the above scheme. However, your lecture grade will only count for 75% of your final grade, while your lab grade will count for the remaining 25% of your final grade. 
  * You are encouraged to visit the observatory on the roof of Van Allen Hall to see the objects discussed in this class. A laboratory instructor will be on duty on **clear** nights, Monday through Thursday, at 9:00 PM. The roof of Van Allen Hall may be reached from a stairway at the east end of the 7th floor. The roof is kept dark during observing sessions, so watch your step! 
  * I would like to hear from anyone who has a disability which may require some modification of seating, testing, or other class requirements so that appropriate arrangements may be made. Please see me after class or during office hours. 
  * Geometry and algebra will be used as necessary in class, but the course will not be highly mathematical. 
  * Class attendance is not required in this course. However, if you come to class, it is important that you refrain from doing things that distract either me or your fellow students from our common objective: that each of you comes away from the lecture with a better understanding of the material. To that end, it is expected that you: 
    * not talk during class---this includes whispered conversations of more than a few words 
    * not leave class before class is over (in other words, only come if you're prepared to stay for the whole 50 minutes) 
    * not read the newspaper during class 
    * not prepare your books and papers for leaving before the class is over. 
  * If you have any questions about any of the topics covered in class or in the book feel free to come to my office hours. Taking advantage of office hours is one of the best ways to improve your performance on the tests.

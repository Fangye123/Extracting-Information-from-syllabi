> _Washington Semester: Program Choices:_ ** Peace and Conflict Resolution**

>

> ![](pcr1.jpg)It's not just a semester program, it's an adventure!
Washington, D.C., is an international hub and the place to study this new and
growing field. But the Washington Semester Program takes you even one step
further and sends your class on a three-week overseas field practicum to a
region which has experienced the conflict and peace process firsthand such as
the Middle East, Northern Ireland, South Africa, or the Balkans. You meet the
people involved in and affected by regional strife and get the rare
opportunity to put a human face on conflicts you may have only heard about on
the news. This program draws students from many majors, all with the common
interest of making the world a better place to live.

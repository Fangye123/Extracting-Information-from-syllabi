**Overview**

> This course introduces students to the recent empirical literature of
industrial organization. We will cover a variety of topics including price
discrimination, cartels and collusion, entry and market structure, information
and competition, technological change, auctions and firm organization. Every
1-2 weeks, we focus on a particular topic and review 3-4  recent empirical
papers on that topic.  For each paper, we will discuss in detail the research
question, related theories, the data, the identification strategies,
estimation techniques and policy implications. My goal is that, at the end of
the semester, students have a good idea of how to take an industrial
organization theory to data or vice versa.

**Prerequisite**

> You are assumed to be familiar with econometrics and microeconomics theory,
including game theory. Therefore, first year graduate courses in these areas
are regarded  as prerequisite. This course is also the third course in the
second year graduate sequence in industrial organization, so it is required
for those taking industrial organization as a field. Other students are
welcome as well.

**Readings**

> There is no text book. Reading list is provided in course outline.  If a
particular paper is electronically available in JSTOR / NBER working papers,
you can click on the paper title to get in JSTOR / NBER. A complete set of
hard copy for all the other reading papers is available at the library reserve
as well as the Economics Departmental Office (Tydings 3105).

>

> Each student is recommended to obtain a copy of Jean Tirole's _The Theory of
Industrial Organization_ or Luis M.B. Cabral edited _Readings in Industrial
Organization_ as a reference for the theoretical literature related to the
topics we cover in class.

**Assignments**

> You are required to fulfill the following assignments, with grading weights
in parentheses. There is no mid-term or final.

> (15) Class Performance

> > You are expected to read each paper before the class and actively
participate in discussion during the class. The value of discussion will be
maximized if you prepare well, listen to the others' comments and offer
insights to your peers (and your professor). It is a good idea if you can
review [a list of
questions](http://www.glue.umd.edu/~ginger/teaching/econ664-spring2002/list-
questions.html) while reading each paper before the class meeting.

> (15) Seminar Summary

>

>> You are required to submit a one page summary for each regular IO seminar
in industrial organization. If it is an empirical study, you are required to
answer questions on [List
A](http://www.glue.umd.edu/~ginger/teaching/econ664-spring2002/list-a.html).
If it is a theoretical study, you are required to answer questions on [List
B](http://www.glue.umd.edu/~ginger/teaching/econ664-spring2002/list-b.html).
The summary is due in the Thursday class meeting one week after the seminar.
My grading for seminar summary is only a head count, but writing a good
summary for other people's work is a necessary start of your own research.

>

> (20) Referee Report

>

>> In the last meeting before spring break, you are expected to turn in a
referee report for an unpublished empirical paper. The referee report shall
include the paper's contribution to the literature, key weakness, and
recommendations for future improvement. The report should be no longer than 5
pages, with all you points clearly presented, not a replication of what the
author has written.

>

> (50) Research Proposal

>

>> You are expected to assemble a research proposal at the end of the
semester, describing a research question that you would like to answer in the
area of empirical IO, the data you would like to use and the identification
strategy you are going to adopt assuming the availability of perfect data. To
facilitate feedback, each student is required to present his/her research
proposal in a 10-minute slot during the last two class meeting. The written
proposal is due 10 days after.

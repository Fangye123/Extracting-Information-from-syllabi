**INTRODUCTION:**  

This course will examine the cultures, social structures, and institutions of
selected societies in the Caribbean basin. We will look at several quite
different cultures, cultures that may vary along lines that are racial,
ethnic, religious, linguistic, economic, or all of the preceding. We will
examine the effects of structural variables such as race, ethnicity, language,
and gender. We will study, among others, the institutions of government,
economy, religion, family, and sports. Comparisons will be made among the
various cultures and with other societies, especially the United States. A
case study approach will be used, focusing attention in class on a small
number of societies. Students will do a term project on one aspect of one or
more Caribbean societies. The course will be offered in a seminar format, with
intensive student participation.  

This course will emphasize the cultural differences that exist in the
Caribbean region. These variations may be the result of different-British,
French, Spanish, Dutch-colonial histories, different religious influences,
different geographic factors, and other factors. But whatever their sources,
the differences have resulted in myriad cultural forms. Because of this
emphasis, successful completion of this course will satisfy the University
Core course requirement in Cultural Diversity.

**GRADES:**

     Midterm Exam: 20% (Date: TBA)

    The Term Projects: Each student will complete four term projects. (1) In-Class Presentation. Each student will prepare a class presentation (10%) on some aspect of Caribbean culture; students who wish may work in a team of two or three to produce this project. (2) Term Paper. Each student, individually, will submit a term paper of 8-12 pages (20%); this paper may be directly related to the class presentation-if so, it should go considerably beyond the class presentation-or it may be a totally separate endeavor. (3) The "Immigrant Paper." Each student will write a paper on some aspect of the experience of Caribbean immigrants in the United States. This paper may be based on one of the two books listed in reading #3, above. If you choose one of these books, you may co-author the paper with a student who is reading the other book in #3, and your paper should compare and contrast the experiences opf the two groups. You also may choose a different book, or focus on a different immigrant group. (4) The Critical Review: Each student will be required to do a critical review of some aspect of Caribbean popular culture. You may review a novel, or a film, or a series of paintings or sculptures, or musical forms, or a Caribbean sport, etc. About 5 pages will be sufficient.   

Course Outline and Calendar (subject to change):  

    Week 1: Introduction: Cross-Cultural Studies; Why Study the Caribbean?   
    Weeks 2-3: A Brief History of the Caribbean Region  
    Weeks 4-5: Basic Concepts: Culture & Society; Social Institutions (e.g., family, religion, slavery)   
    Weeks 6-10: Caribbean Cultures (includes student presentations)   
    Weeks 11-13: Caribbean Cultures in the United States.   
    Week 15: Summary and Conclusion  

    Note: At various points in the semester, I hope to arrange opportunities for us to experience some aspects of Caribbean life and scholarship in the Boston area. For example, there is a conference on "Caribbean Women Writers" at Wellesley College in April; I hope that we can go there as a class one day. I also hope to bring in guest speakers who are expert in some specialized aspect of Caribbean culture. Suggestions are welcome.

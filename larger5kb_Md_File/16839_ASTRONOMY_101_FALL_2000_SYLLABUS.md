**GETTYSBURG COLLEGE, FALL 2002**

##  **Class Syllabus**

**How to use this syllabus**

Classes in Astronomy meet from either 1:10 to 2:00 PM or 2:10 to 3:00 PM  on
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday in Mara Auditorium, Masters Hall. You are
expected to attend your assigned class sessions, and no more than 4 absences
are permitted. You should find the attendance requirement more helpful than
burdensome, however.  Astronomy is rapidly changing field, with news breaking
daily, and you will therefore find that many details presented in the lectures
will not be found in the text. Keep your notes carefully, with a mind to using
them as a prime study guide for the course. Indeed you will want to take notes
from the readings _before_ each class meets. Suggestion: prepare a rough
outline of topics that should come up in class, so that you can better follow
the lectures and so that you can anticipate what questions you might like to
have answered in class.    Don't just read the posted outlines on the web
(though that's a good idea, too).  Rather, make up your own notes based on
readings and outlines.

The lectures will presuppose that you have done your own reading and
preparation. Insofar as is possible, the lectures will explain and elaborate
on the reading assignments, not simply rehash them. Please ask questions
during and outside of class to make sure you've got your notes clear and that
important points are covered.  By all means make use of the available office
hours.

All assignments are from Fraknoi, Morrison,  and Wolff  _VOYAGES TO THE
PLANETS (Second Edition)_. Classes on which there will be in-class quizzes are
marked on the syllabus below. Note that there will be a midterm exam at a
special time period **in the evening at 7 pm, Thursday, October 24 in Mara
Auditorium.** Be sure to reserve this time. The date and time of the Final
Exam, **Wednesday Evening, December 18th, 6:30-9:30 PM** is given at the end
of this schedule and on the course calendar. Mark the date of the final in
your date book, too: it's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!  

Be sure to bookmark and/or print out this syllabus (and the other calendars
and schedules), for reference throughout the term.

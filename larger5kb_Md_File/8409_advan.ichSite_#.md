**THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS INTENSIVE FIELD COURSE IS TO BECOME FAMILIAR WITH THE
DIVERSITY OF FISHES OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES, AS IT RELATES TO
PHYSIOGRAPHY AND DRAINAGE HISTORY.   AQUATIC CONSERVATION IS ALSO
EMPHASIZED.**

**THE FIELD PORTION OF THE COURSE INCLUDED COLLECTING FISHES FROM MAJOR
DRAINAGES IN:**

* ** [FLORIDA](florida.html)**
* ** [ARKANSAS/MISSISSIPPI](AR.html)**
* ** [TENNESSEE](tn.html)**
  




**FISHES WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN THEIR NATURAL HABITATS BY SNORKELING.   A TOTAL
OF 134 SPECIES (4144 specimens) FROM 32 SITES WERE COLLECTED.**

    **COURSE SYLLABUS ? Johnston/ArmbrusterCourse Number:  ZYWL/FISH 7390
    Course Title:   Advanced Ichthyology
    Credit Hours:   6 (Note:  this will be a 5 week, second term summer field course.  As an extensive (3.5 weeks) field trip
                    is required, no other courses can be taken at the same time.  The course will have no distinct lecture and
                    lab portions; both will mesh).
    Prerequisites:  ZYWL/FISH 6380
    
    I.      Course Content/Objectives:
    
            1.      Objectives:  To provide students with identification and curatorial skills necessary for working with fishes
                    , using drainages in the southeastern United States as a natural laboratory.  Students will also gain
                    intensive field experience, developing skills in map reading, field note techniques, and numerous gears
                    associated with the collection and preservation of fishes.
    
            2.      Tentative Schedule and Outline of Course
    
            Lecture                         Laboratory Periods                      
    
            Week 1  Introduction            No lab
                    Zoogeography, curatorial techniques, ethics and animal care, collection techniques, methods of map reading,
                    field note techniques.
    
            Week 2  Field ? coastal plain
    
            Week 3  Field ? Atlantic slope; Appalachians
    
            Week 4  Field ? Ozarks; Mississippi River
    
            Week 5  Curation and Exam
    
            3.      Textbooks:
    
                    1)  Required ? Field Guide to Freshwater Fishes, Page and Burr 1991

            2.      Grading system:
    
                    Collection              40%
                    Field notebook          20%
                    Final exam              40%
    
            3.      Grading scale:
    
                    >/= 90% = A
                    >/= 80% = B
                    >/= 70% = C
                    >/= 60% = D
                       <60% = F
    
    III.    Students are expected to attend class and exams.  Students with a written excuse from the Dean may take a

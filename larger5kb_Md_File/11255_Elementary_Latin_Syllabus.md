### **DESCRIPTION:**

A one-year course in the fundamentals of the Latin language which provides the
basic skills for reading and translating Latin poetry and prose. 6 credits.
Note: Credit will not be received for CLS 121 until 122 is completed.

### **LEARNING OUTCOMES:**

  1. knowledge of the essential forms, grammar, and syntax of the Latin language; familiarity with basic Latin vocabulary 
  2. understanding of how these fundamentals differ from the forms, grammar, and syntax of English, leading to an increased understanding of how both languages function 
  3. ability to read, understand, and translate adapted passages in Latin
  4. ability to read, understand, and translate unadapted passages in Latin with appropriate assistance
  5. acquaintance with the daily life and culture of the ancient Romans 
  6. recognition and understanding of the values and social attitudes of the ancient Romans, particularly as these are embedded in their language 

### **METHODS:**

Class time will be devoted to explanation and discussion of the Latin language
and culture; reading aloud and translating Latin passages, including
occasional poems and Latin graffiti; computer demonstrations of on-line
resources on Latin language and culture; occasional Latin games and other
interactive activities. Our goal will be to complete Parts I and II of the
textbook for the year.

### **REQUIREMENTS:**

**Homework:** Hand in all required written exercises for each chapter; prepare
all assigned Latin passages for oral presentation in the next class; print out
and hand in the scores and analyses for all required _Compendium_ drills.
[objectives 1, 2, 3, 4]

**Classwork:** Read aloud and translate orally Latin passages from the
textbook, _Auricula Meretricula_ , and xeroxed selections; participate in all
other class activities, including exercises and discussions. [all course
objectives]

**Attendance:** The class meets Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:00-10:40; these
class periods have been lengthened in order to allow for the extra practice
and help required when beginning a language. Students should arrive promptly
and attend class regularly. Because of the nature of language learning, steady
attendance of class is very important. Therefore any student with more than
**four** unexcused absences will lose **3 points** on the class participation
portion of the grade for every subsequent class missed. All students are
responsible for assignments and classwork missed due to absence, whether
excused or unexcused, and no quizzes may be cut.

**Quizzes:** There will be a quiz for every two chapters that we cover. These
tests will focus on material and vocabulary of the two chapters, although a
certain cumulative effect is inevitable in dealing with a language. No make-up
quizzes will be given, although I will drop one quiz grade (the lowest) each
semester (except in the case of an unexcused absence on a test day).
[objectives 1, 3, 4]

**Second Semester Projects:** Students will complete various projects
utilizing the resources of the on-line [VRoma Project](http://www.vroma.org/)
and [MOO](http://www.vroma.org:7878/), extending and enriching the work of my
spring '98 class who built the _cubiculum sermonis_ and pioneered interactive
Latin projects in the MOO. If possible, we will schedule some joint activities
with one or more Latin classes from other locations who are using the same
textbook. [all course objectives]

**Finals week:** There will be no mid-term or final examinations, since
learning a language must be accomplished by continual, steady work rather than
by occasional cramming. To assess how we are meeting our primary goal of
developing the ability to translate Latin, we will use the time assigned
during finals week for a written translation of one or more Latin narrative
passages that students have not previously seen; texts and notebooks may be
used for reference. [objectives 3, 4]

**Course Summary:** This course will examine contemporary Latin America and
its changing place in the so-called "New World Order." We will start by
examining Latin American society in the mid-20th Century, with an emphasis on
the place of indigenous people in national societies and the international
economy. We will read ethnographies from Mesoamerica, the Andean region and
Amazonia. We will then examine the forces of globalization and change and how
these are affecting the people of Latin America, especially indigenous people.
We will also discuss theories and approaches to understanding globalization
and how the process of globalization affects anthropological research.

The course is designed on a seminar basis. Students are expected to complete
readings in the assigned time and come to class prepared to discuss them.
Individuals will be designated to discuss particular readings and guide the
class discussion.

The class will be organized as follows:  

**Part One:** Weeks 1-5 -- The first part of the course will focus on the
cultures of Latin America in the mid 20th Century. This will provide a
baseline with which to examine the forces of social and economic change
affecting the region.  

> **Readings:**

> Week 1: Allen: _The Hold Life Has Life Has_ , Introduction-Ch 4, Ch 9,
Epilogue; Patch: "La Parada, Lima's market: Serrano, criollo and the confusion

** **

**Part Two:** Weeks 6-11 -- This section of the course will explore the forces
of change affecting contemporary cultures of Latin America. These include
violence associated with revolutionary (and counter-revolutionary) change,
increased insertion of Latin America in the global economy and the penetration
of the market into former "regions of refuge." We will read two books and a
series of articles that essentially update the three regions under
consideration: Mesoamerica, the Andean region and Amazonia.  

> **Readings:**

>

> Week 6: Burgos-Debary: _I, Rigoberta Menchu_ , Ch 1-14  
>  Week 7: Burgos-Debary: _I, Rigoberta Menchu_ , Ch 15-35, selected writings
of Rigoberta Menchu.  
>  Week 8: Hecht and Cockburn, _The Fate of the Forest_ (chapters to be
announced)  
>  Week 9: Hecht and Cockburn _The Fate of the Forest_ (chapters to be
announced)  
>  Week 10: Selected articles on Sendero Luminoso, and the rise of Alberto
Fujimori in Peru.

>

> **Exam 2:100 points** (Take home handed out 11/6, returned 11/13)  
>

**Part Three:** Weeks 11-15 - The last few weeks of class will be devoted to a
discussion of student papers and projects along with consideration of the
future of Latin America in the context of "the end of history." We will be
exploring the Zapatista uprising in Mexico, drug trafficking and political
violence in the Andean region, conflict and reconstruction in Central America,
and frontier expansion and contraction in the Amazon Basin.

> **Readings:** A packet of photocopied readings for each topic will be made
available to students. Readings from Sachs' The Development Dictionary will be
assigned for class reading (to be announced).

* * *

**Course Requirements:** The readings have been chosen to give an overview of
major culture areas and issues in the anthropology of Latin America and will
be complemented by videos and slides. Students are expected to complete all
the required readings, attend seminars and participate in and lead class
discussions. There will be two exams (100 points each) covering each section
of the course. Each exam is a take home exam and provides an opportunity to
reflect on and analyze the course readings and content.  

In addition students are required to write a [research paper on a topic of
their choosing relevant to the seminar's subject matter. The research paper
should be approximately 20 double-spaced, type-written pages. Papers should
attempt to push the boundaries of current processes of social and cultural
change, globalization and the effects of global change on local communities.
Topics such as the local impacts of NAFTA on Mexico, the growing maquiladora
industry, the impacts of non-traditional agricultural exports, rapid
urbanization and rural-urban and international migration would be appropriate.
The paper will be graded on both content, clarity, organization and
grammatically correct writing. Paper topics must be finalized by the first
exam. A rough draft is due before Thanksgiving break (11/20). The final
version of the paper is due Wed, 12/11. The paper is worth 300 points. **_Late
papers will incur a severe penalty!_**

**Statement on Academic Honesty** Academic misconduct (as defined in the Chico
State catalogue) will not be tolerated. I encourage students to discuss course
materials inside and outside the classroom. But all written material submitted
by students must be their own work exclusively This is especially true of the
writing of take home exams. Feel free to discuss, but the final written
product must be your own. Be sure to cite sources appropriately, use quotes
where required, and indicate the source of the ideas expressed. Use
parenthetical referencing, following the format in your text books. When in
doubt, cite. To do otherwise is plagiarism. if you have any questions about
what constitutes academic dishonesty, or the consequences of academic
misconduct, consult the university's catalogue, or ask me.

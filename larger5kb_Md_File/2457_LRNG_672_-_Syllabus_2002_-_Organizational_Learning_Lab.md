The subject of organizational learning came to academic attention in 1978 when
Chris Argyris and Donald Schon published _Organizational Learning: A Theory of
Action Perspective_. Schon followed with the _Reflective Practitioner_ , which
evoked considerable interest among practitioners in the field. The momentum
that was building during the following ten years culminated with the
publication of Peter Senge's widely read _The Fifth Discipline: The Art and
Practice of the Learning Organization_. Since then, hundreds of other articles
and books have announced the birth of a new discipline, expanded public
awareness of it, and motivated a significant number of corporations,
nonprofits, and governmental agencies to set forth on the path to becoming a
learning organization.  
__  
Conventional organizations are locked into a rigid view of their methods and
goals. They attend only to a narrow range of experience and feedback, and
encourage their managers to make only those changes that fit the current
structure. Consequently, the conventional organization merely adapts or reacts
to change. In contrast, the learning organization anticipates the future and
strives to create new services and products before others are able to perceive
these needs. They are flexible, open to new ideas, and willing to innovate
because they are intensely reflexive. In other words, they discover
organizational excellence by continuously rethinking what they do, how they do
it, and how they might do it better.  
  
It is important to note that the despite the above polarizing categorization
of organizations into conventional and learning, few will fit into either. One
could argue that most organizations have elements of both.  
  
_Organizational Learning Laboratory_ is designed to focus on both micro and
macro aspects of organizational change from a managerial and consulting point
of view. Using experiential learning approaches (primarily simulations), one
half of the course will deal with micro issues such as development of
communication, motivation, leadership, decision-making and consulting skills.
Further, just as in a laboratory, you will have opportunities to experiment
with, observe, and experience the relevance of several management constructs
related to organizational learning and develop critical thinking about them.  
  
The other half of the course will focus on developing the skills needed for
organizational analysis, design, and change using several methodologies
including a new one known as _appreciative inquiry_. Students will work in
small action teams charged with the task of learning to function as
consultants to a selected list of organizations. The anticipation is that, at
the end, you would have acquired a better sense of judgment, understanding,
and competence regarding how to diagnose and analyze organizations and, to a
certain extent, develop skills to become better facilitators (change agents)
of organizational learning.  
  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND EVALUATION**  
  
1\. **Personal Application Essay (PAE):** ** __****Analysis of** ** _Virginia
Greetings Corporation_** ****  
**simulation**  
  
Personal Application Essays (PAE) are assignments that integrate theory and
practice. Following Kolb's (1984) experiential learning cycle, a PAE has four
components: _concrete experience_ (CE), _reflective observation_ (RO),
_abstract conceptualization_ (AC), and _active experimentation_ (AE). The PAE
is written based on your experiences in a simulation we will do in class on
Saturday,  
**March 2** and its debriefing as well as readings and concepts found in the
textbooks. The CE is a detailed description of the class simulation
experience. In RO, you reflect on the experience from different perspectives.
AC is the place to theorize or conceptualize the experience based on readings
and concepts, some of which will be discussed in class. AE is your opportunity
to suggest what you will do differently in a comparable situation in the
future or in your workplace. In other words, you not only describe and reflect
on the experiences, but also experiment with new learning and action plans.  
  
The PAEs should be about twenty double spaced pages. The PAE checklist
enclosed with this syllabus should be self-scored and attached to your
assignment.  
  
**Due date: April 5**  
  
  
2. **Organizational Analysis and Presentation**   
  
(a) **Organizational Analysis**  
  
Using the appreciative inquiry model discussed in class or another model
described in the text each team will analyze an organization. Choose an
organization which will grant you reasonable access; that is, you can go see
it, talk to people, ask questions etc., It may be your place of work, other
affiliations such as a nonprofit organization, or any other organizational
entity that has enough structure and dynamics for analysis.  
  
After your group has collected data and analyzed them, produce a written
report that describes your assessment of the organization. It should include a
short description of the model, the means with which you collected data, your
conclusions and recommendations.  
  
This paper should be about thirty-five pages. It will be graded based on the
criteria outlined at the end of this syllabus.  
  
**Due dates: February 15** for a one-page description of your proposal emailed
to me (thatchen@gmu.edu)  
and **May 4** for the final team-paper (No extension possible beyond this
date).  
  
(b) **Organizational Analysis Presentation**  
  
Each team will present their organizational analysis including
recommendations/interventions to the entire class. Ideally, all group members
should participate in the presentation. Teams are encouraged to be creative in
designing their presentations such as using role-play and skits.  
  
The presentations will be graded both by the instructor and the class.
Richness and depth of analysis, organization of presentation material, and the
degree of audience of involvement will be used as criteria for evaluation.  
  
**Presentation date: May 4**  
  
**1\. Attendance and participation**  
  
The expectation is that each of you will take an active part in class
discussions and group projects and form into a learning community. Full
attendance for all classes is required. In addition, you are expected to meet
with your team members outside of class time and contribute to the project
work. This includes, as mentioned above, collecting data from an organization
of your choice by doing interviews, analyzing them, proposing intervention
plans if necessary, and finally, writing an organizational analysis report and
presenting it to the class.  
  
Since experiential exercises, simulations, and class discussions constitute
the major part of this course, missing sessions will significantly affect your
ability to benefit from this course. In addition, missing classes will limit
your ability to write assignments since they are based on your experiences
during the class and group project.  
  
**Evaluation** :  
The distribution of points will be as follows:

**LRNG 672 SPRING 2002**  
**Organizational Learning Laboratory**  
**Personal application essay (PAE) checklist**

  
  
  
  
**Instructions: Please circle appropriate choices and attach to your PAE**  
  
**Concrete Experience:** **(6 points)**  
  
， Does the paper contain an _objective,_ thorough description of what happened
in the simulation?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Does the paper contain a _subjective_ description of my feelings,
perceptions and thoughts regarding what happened during the simulation?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
1) Not writing about your feelings  
2) Skipping important details  
3) Writing too much about others and little about self  
  
  
**Reflective Observation:** **(6 points)**  
  
， Did I look at the simulation from different points view?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Did I write about the role I had played and its impact on the outcomes of
the simulation?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
， Do the different perspectives add significant meaning to my understanding of
the simulation and will that be evident to the reader?  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Have I chosen five themes to explore further in AC and AE? Yes/No  
  
What are they? List them here.  
  
1.-----------------, 2.-------------------, 3.-------------------,
4.---------------, 5.-----------------.  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
  
1) Not having multiple perspectives (That is, just listing one perspective
only which is your personal reflection)  
  
2) Not listing the five themes  
  
3) Reflecting more on others' behavior and less on self  
  
4) Raising questions or issues without grounding them on data/CE (Examples:
Raising questions about power, norms, etc though there is no mention of
contributing events in CE)  
  
5) Not exploring the nature or level of your participation in the simulation.  
  
  
  
  
**Abstract Conceptualization:** **(12 points)**  
  
， Did I relate concepts from assigned readings (texts) to the group
experience?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， In relating concepts/ readings to the experience, have I described what the
readings are, or what they signify, instead of merely mentioning the concept,
author, or a book?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， In trying to make sense of the experiences, have I used concepts/ readings
from the two texts instead of just one source?  
  
Used both texts Used one Used none  
  
， Did I conceptualize all five themes? Yes/No  
  
  
， Did I devote equal attention to all themes? Yes/No  
  
  
， Did I list them in theory or statement form? Yes/No  
  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
  
1) Not elaborating on reading  
  
2) Just listing readings only instead of describing them (related to #1)  
  
3) Having AC based on themes that were not discussed in RO  
  
4) Simply elaborating on readings without saying how they apply. For example,
someone writes a whole page on norms (readings) but doesn't say how it applies
to the experience.  
  
  
Please note that this segment carries 12 out of the 30 points allotted to the
PAE. You must use readings extensively to do well in this section. Use the
Cummings & Worley, Schein, and any other readings you find relevant. It is not
enough to mention readings. Explain what the readings are and show how they
apply to your experience.  
  
  
**Active Experimentation:** **(6 points)**  
  
_Imagine this simulation is run again in the class. What specific actions will
you take that will improve your effectiveness?_  
  
How well have I responded to this question?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
， Have I described the generalizations I can make from what I have learned
from this simulation to my work situation?  
  
To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
  
， Are my A.E. plans described specifically, thoroughly, and in detail?

To a great extent Somewhat Only minimally  
  
  
， Did I write at least one AE about each of the five themes I had discussed in
RO and AC section? Yes/No  
  
**Common mistakes:**  
1) Not having AE for each theme that was developed in RO and AC  
2) AE looks more like an intention statement rather than an action plan.
Merely expresses a desire to do something different, but doesn't state
specifically the action component.  
3) Coming up with AE statements that are not linked to the CE-RO-AC flow  
4) Not mentioning the context of application (where will you practice it and
when)

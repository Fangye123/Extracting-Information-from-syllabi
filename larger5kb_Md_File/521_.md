HISTORY OF SCIENCE:  ORIGINS TO NEWTON

* * *

In this course we survey changes and developments in Western science (natural
philosophy) from earliest times through the Scientific Revolution of the
Seventeenth century. Lectures, discussions, and readings are concerned with
the origin(s), transmission, and development of scientific ideas, and the
emergence of new intellectual and language communities. Particular emphasis is
given to changing views and conceptions of 'science, nature, and man.' There
will be a **One Hour In-Class Essay Exam** in addition to a **Take-Home Last
Essay.** Please note that attendance and participation are mandatory. Students
may chose to write an extra-credit **Optional Research Essay** ; please see
the _Study Guide_ and this WebSite for details. Office hours for Dr Hatch are
Tuesday, 3.00-6.00pm and by appointment, 4123 Turlington Hall. Students are
strongly encouraged to take advantage of Office Hours. Telephone: 392.0271

Evaluation:

All required work is announced on this syllabus. But please note. This is a
demanding course.  As this syllabus indicates, the course involves substantial
reading and writing. Attendance is mandatory and careful preparation and
active involvement in discussion is critical. Evaluation criteria and course
requirements are straightforward. Since a schedule is provided in advance,
absences and arrangements for late work **must** be approved in advance.
Please plan your course schedule and study commitments with care. When in
doubt consult the syllabus, ask questions, and read ahead. Finally, students

Book Exams and University level essays, as well as suggestions about Reading
Writing.  Students are responsible for reading this material:

no one is penalized for not choosing this option. The term paper allow
interested students to pursue a course topic in greater detail or to identify
an area not treated in this general survey course of readings and lectures.
Consider carefully whether you have sufficient time to do a proper job. The

**Description:**

     This course provides an introductory study of the mathematical models used in computer graphics to mimic the physical behavior of light in the generation of three-dimensional, computer-generated imagery. In addition, the course addresses the issues of visual storytelling through the application of cinematic techniques in the digital domain. The course is intended for students without a technical background in computer graphics. 

**Prequisites:**

     Permission of instructor
    3D modeling/rendering experience (e.g. ACCAD 750 or equiv).

**Course Objectives and Student Learning Outcomes:**

     The generation of compelling synthetic imagery is primarily dependent upon two issues in computer graphics: the geometric shape of objects in the digital world and the illumination of those objects. This course will concentrate on the latter concern, the interplay of geometry and light, and discuss the physical reality, the computational models, and the application of cinematographic techniques in the digital domain. Students will develop the skills to use digital lighting for the purposes of storytelling and visual communication. They will also learn the mathematics and physics behind the simulation of light, texture, and form in computer graphics, and apply that knowledge by writing their own RenderMan shaders. Students will be encouraged to explore a broad range of styles, from photorealistic, to painterly, to cartoon-style. 

The course will additionally enhance the students' ability to utilize lighting
and shading for storytelling and visual communication. Each student will be
expected to master fundamental, theoretical concepts in digital lighting, thus
allowing them to use rendering software dependent upon those concepts more
effectively and efficiently. Students will also gain necessary skills and
experience to produce customized light and shading models, which provide
aesthetic possibilities not available in "off-the-shelf" packages.

**Course Methodology**

     The course will attempt to survey the important issues surrounding the creation of virtual lights and the surfaces they illuminate in digital environments. The different types of lighting and surfaces employed in computer graphics, as well as their respective effects, will be examined. Images illustrating different lighting approaches will be shown whenever possible, but students will learn primarily by creating and lighting their own objects and environments. The class format will take on a variety of styles as the disparate subjects dictate. Examples will be presented in lectures and demonstrations. Students will present their images in critique sessions. 

Students must demonstrate satisfactory achievement of course objectives
through fulfillment of course projects and by contributing to class
discussions and critiques. Course projects will require students to use a wide
variety of software and equipment at ACCAD to produce images and shaders.
Collaboration between students in the course and other faculty, staff and
students at ACCAD is encouraged. Course evaluation will be based on the
following:

Projects one through six: 10% each  
Final Project: 30%  
Class Participation: 10%  

**Grading Policies:**

     All students are required to be on time and in attendance for each and every class. Students arriving to class more than 10 minutes late will be counted as absent. Two absences will lower a final grade by 1/2 a letter, three absences will lower a final grade by one letter and four absences will result in failure of the course. 

Adherence to deadlines is expected. It is the individual student's
responsibility to keep track of deadlines and to present the work to the class
and instructor on the specified dates. 15% per day will be subtracted from
late assignments.

Students choosing to use "at home" hardware and software must have their
current working files on the system and available for review at the beginning
of each and every class. Problems with home systems and/or incompatibility
will not be an acceptable excuse for missed goals. Technical problems will
happen frequently during the semester and students will have trouble accessing
the computer lab during "prime time" hours. Students must make their own
arrangements for overcoming these difficulties and submitting their work on
time. Unless there is a complete system failure in a computer-related course,
technical difficulties are never an acceptable excuse for not meeting a
deadline. Students should plan their time and work so as to anticipate the
technical hurdles that are a part of this profession.

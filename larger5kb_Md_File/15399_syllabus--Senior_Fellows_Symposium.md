**COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
**  
This course is designed to spark critical thinking about the social,
political, and economic institutions in which we live and work, and the role
of intellectuals in those institutions and the larger society. We will ask
questions about the nature of democracy and its relationship to the mass
media, the role of citizens in a democracy and attempts to shape their
thinking and action through mass communication, and the political and moral
issues faced by folks who do intellectual work.  
  
Although the term  "intellectual" carries negative connotations for some (as
in "pointy-headed intellectual"), if you are in this class you are in some
sense an intellectual. That's not necessarily a bad thing. It's possible to be
an intellectual and not be an elitist, self-indulgent, or useless person. Even
if you are elitist, self-indulgent, or useless, it is still important to think
about your role in society. That's what we will do in this course.  
  
**Important Note for Students with Disabilities:** The University of Texas at
Austin provides upon request appropriate academic accommodations for qualified
students with disabilities. For more information, contact the Office of the
Dean of Students at 471-6259, 471-4641 TTY.  
  
  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  
**  
   Your grade will be based on your writing and your talking. Here's the
formula:  
   1\. three papers, 25 points each:         75 points  
   2\. participation in class discussion:    25 points  
  
   1\. Papers: Each paper (four to six pages, typed, double-spaced) will
address a simple question that has no simple answer.  
_    Paper #1: What is democracy?  
   Paper #2: What is the difference between persuasion and propaganda?  
   Paper #3: What is the moral responsibility of an intellectual in the United
States today?  
_    Your papers can make reference to readings from the course and/or outside
readings. The goal, however, is not a paper in which you catalog what others
have written but one in which you articulate your own view, drawing on the
work of others when appropriate.  
  
   2\. Class participation:  
   This is a seminar course, which means you are responsible for coming to
class ready to participate. Read the material for the week before you come to
class on Tuesday and be prepared to speak. I will ask you questions.  
   At the end of the semester I will judge your overall contribution to class
discussion. This portion of your grade will be based on your: (a) familiarity
with readings; (b) ability to hear and understand what others say; (c) ability
to express yourself clearly; (d) ability to synthesize the thoughts of others
to form new insights, conclusions, or questions; (e) ability to disagree
constructively; and (f) cooperation in building a stimulating and supportive
intellectual atmosphere in class.  
   Because a quarter of your grade is based on class participation, it is
obvious that attendance is crucial; you can't participate if you aren't there.
I will handle folks who miss class on a case-by-case basis. If you have to
miss a class and have a good excuse, let me know.  
  
NOTE: This is an honors class. That doesn't mean everyone automatically gets
an A. It means the standards are higher.

**Course Description:** This course surveys American military history
chronologically and thematically from 1607 to the present.   It traces the
beginnings of a uniquely American military and focuses not only on wars,
leaders and strategy, but on such topics as civilian attitudes toward a
standing army, soldier motivation, defense funding, anti-war movements and
women's wartime roles.

**Course Objective:**   This course seeks to teach an appreciation of the
nature and effects of war, the evolution of warfare, military theory and
professionalization of the army.  Students will gain an understanding of the
historical evolution of the U.S. military and its place and function in
American society.

**Recommend Reading:  
** Strunk, Jr., William & E.B. White, The Elements of Style (4rth Edition)

**Note about the Reading: The first two required books listed above will act
as textbooks, and the third required book by Chambers and Piehler will serve
as the basis for class discussion and written essays.  We will not have the
time or opportunity during class time to cover every topic contained in these
books, but expect to be quizzed and /or tested on all the assigned reading.
Weekly reading assignment runs on average about 100 pages, but occasionally
there is more (see the weeks covering World War II and Vietnam).  I expect you
to keep up and do all of the reading conscientiously and carefully.

**Class Attendance:** Class attendance is required. You are allowed three
absences (either excused or unexcused --there is no distinction)  for the
semester.  Roll will be taken daily and more than three absences will have a
detrimental effect on your final grade.

**Quizzes:**   Short, multiple choice quizzes will cover important points from
the reading and lecture notes.  There are no make-ups for quizzes, but the
lowest quiz grade will be dropped.

**Exams:** There will be two essay tests and a final exam, each covering one
third of the course material. Tests and the final exam will include essay and
short identification questions.

**Analytical Essay Assignments:** Because this course emphasizes reading and
interpreting mainly secondary sources rather than doing primary research, you
will be asked to turn in four   brief analytical essays (2-3 typed, double-
spaced pages in length), in which you will reflect on and discuss specific
questions related to essays in Chambers and  Piehler, Major Problems in
American Military History.  Specific questions for each assignment are listed
below:

Essay #1 (Chambers & Piehler, Chapter 2, pp. 37-64): Compare and contrast
Colonial and  
Native American conceptions of war.  
Essay #2: (Chambers & Piehler, Chapter 6, pp. 168-85): Assess the generalships
of Lee,  
Sherman and Grant.  
Essay #3: (Chambers & Piehler, Chapter 10, pp. 292-308): Compare and contrast
Billy Mitchell  
and George Patton's "visions" of warfare.  
Essay #4: (Chambers & Piehler, Chapter 15, pp. 475-88): Can air power alone
win wars?

These essays should not merely summarize the author's argument but rather
analyze and reflect your effort to engage and critique the ideas of particular
authors and place his ideas into the larger framework of the course.

Think seriously and creatively about the content of these essays.  Papers will
be evaluated for the quality and concision of their prose as well as for the
breadth and depth of their thought.  I strongly encourage you to read Strunk
and White's Elements of Style early in the semester and pay attention to
questions of English prose as you embark upon these assignments.  I will be
happy to meet with you individually to discuss ways to improve your writing.
Check below for due dates for these assignments.  Late papers will be
penalized 5 points for each day late.

**Class Discussions:** Throughout the semester, selected students will be
responsible for leading discussion of the assigned reading.   These students
will be responsible for submitting at least 4 discussion questions in advance
that critique the content of the selected reading and relate it to the larger
themes of the class.   Students in the class will be expected to respond to
these questions and ask their own questions about the assignment.

**Cheating:** Cheating in any form (including plagiarism --presenting someone
else's words as your own) will not be tolerated.  It is cause for an "F" in
the course and can lead to more serious consequences.  Do your own work and
give other people credit for theirs!

**Class Etiquette:** A certain level of class decorum is required in this
course. Students are expected to come to class on time and remain for the
entire class period unless they have notified the professor or teaching
assistant in advance.   Eating in class is not permitted.  Nor is it
permissible to do work for another class, read newspapers, talk to classmates
during lecture, or sleep.  Repeated failure to follow these guidelines will
have a detrimental effect on the student's overall grade.

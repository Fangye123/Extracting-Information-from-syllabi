**_Description_** : This two-hour pass/fail course offers students a chance
both to use Spanish and to provide a community service.  The Grady Health
System has had increasing demands for interpreting services as the number of
Hispanic patients has grown significantly in recent years.  Spelman student
interpreters serve as the link between these Spanish-speaking patients and the
hospital's medical and administrative personnel.  Students are not put in
emergency room situations, but work with doctors, nurses, patients and
families in a general hospital setting.  In addition, students often serve as
a comforting presence, offering words of help and encouragement in a patient's
native language.  Students may be asked to interpret in medical,
administrative or family settings, but they are not expected to handle
emergency room situations.

**_Interpreting_** :  
While it is not possible to prepare you for every situation that might cross
your path at the hospital, remember that you have been chosen for this
opportunity because you have the academic background in Spanish and have
passed an oral interview which showed us that you are up to the task of
interpreting for Spanish-speaking patients.  In an interpreting situation, you
will not know every word!  Remember your dictionary and do not be afraid to
use it.  Look up an important word rather than invent.  Ask that people repeat
or slow down as needed.  Have Spanish speakers repeat any question that you do
not understand, you might even ask them to write it.  Note, however, that some
of the patients may be illiterate and keep this in mind when giving them
written material.  Use your free time at the hospital to learn new terms and
expressions, then try them out at the next opportunity.  Try to relate the
forms and structures to what you hear in class and have seen in your readings.
As an interpreter you are rendering a vital service to people; yet even more
important may be the human, verbal contact that you provide.  In a foreign
land and culture you are a reassuring voice and presence to the people you
help through these difficult times.

**_Journal_** :  
You are expected to maintain a journal in Spanish documenting each visit to
the hospital.  Use the journal to write down new words and interesting usages
that you hear.  Note some of the cultural impressions that strike you: where
are patients from?  what do they talk to you about?  what has brought them to
Atlanta?  what experiences have they had in this country, in this city, in
this hospital?  Use the journal to document your activities at the hospital
and to make suggestions.  This journal will be collected at mid-semester and
during finals week.  


**_Hospital duties_** :  
You are not required to be in any setting in which you feel uncomfortable!  A
hospital setting presents many unforseen challenges, and you must be flexible
and mature about dealing with different situations, but you will not be put in
emergency settings.  If any particular situation makes you uncomfortable,
simple excuse yourself ("Lo siento, voy a buscar mas ayuda") and report to
Chaplain Ryan.  Dress appropriately (business attire) for all orientation
sessions and for work.  If you have questions about what is appropriate,
consult with Chaplain Ryan.  When you sign in for service at the hospital, you
will be given a beeper so that medical personnel may page you for
interpreting.  Sometimes you will be very busy, while other days there may be
little "official" work for you.  Use these times to visit the different floors
and inquire if there are Spanish speaking patients who need assistance.  Make
an effort.  Some patients welcome the chance simply to speak with someone in
Spanish.  If you find time at the hospital, maintain your journal or study for
other Spanish classes.  When setting your schedule, keep in mind that weekdays
are generally busier than weekends, thus offering you more chance to practice
your Spanish and to provide assistance.

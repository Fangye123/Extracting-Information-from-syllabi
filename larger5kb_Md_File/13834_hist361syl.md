**  HISTORY OF ENGLAND TO 1688**

Click here to access the Schedule of Assignments

_Required texts (all in paperback):_  
Clayton and David Roberts, _A History of England_. Volume I. Prehistory
to1714. Third edition.  
Brian L. Blakely and Jacquelin Collins (eds.), _Documents in British History.
I: Early Times to 1714.   _Second edition.  
Candace M. Robb, _The Apothecary Rose_.  
Alison Weir, _The Children of Henry VIII_.

        The Roberts text and the Blakely/Collins source collection constitute the core reading for the course. The class will generally be conducted as three lectures per week, but we will also have class discussions based on the material in Blakely/Collins. Students are also urged to raise questions about the reading material and the lectures at any time. 

        If the professor is late to class, students are expected to wait fifteen minutes before leaving. 

        There will be one midterm examination and a final examination. The midterm will be taken in class; the final examination will be a take-home exam to be handed in on the day of the scheduled Final Examination. 

        Students will also write two critical reviews of 8-10 pages each (typewritten and double-spaced) of Robb, _The Apothecary Rose_ , and Weir, _The Children of Henry VIII_.   The Robb work is a historical mystery set in York in 1363.  Weir?s book examines the fates of the three children of the famous (or infamous?) King Henry VIII in the decade after his death in 1547. Guidelines for each review are included with this syllabus. Exercises written outside of class--everything except the midterm--are due at the class meeting on the due date, as indicated below in this syllabus. Papers turned in before 4:00 P. M. on that same day will not be penalized. Papers turned in later will be penalized one letter grade per day or fraction thereof. 

        The basis of the course grade will be 25 per cent for the midterm, 20 per cent each book review, and 35 per cent for the final examination. 

**  Themes**

        In one sense this class will be a traditional and comprehensive study of English history and culture from the beginning to the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688-89. It should provide background for students who wish to do further work in modern English history or in the history of the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, or the Reformation. 

        We will also explore two interconnected themes that may appear contradictory at first glance:   
:  
        1) What developments are so unique to England that its history deserves treatment apart from the more general history of Europe? Do we study it simply because of the impact of the English heritage on American civilization, or does England have a broader significance? 

         2) Although England?s island location has sometimes caused historians to feel that it was isolated from Europe and relatively unaffected by developments there, recent research suggests the contrary: that England was very much a part of Europe. We shall consider the history of England during this period not only in terms of itself, but also in connection with England?s ties with its European neighbors. 

**  Attendance Policy**

        Attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken in class by means of a seating chart after the add period has ended. Accumulation of **seven** unexcused absences (for excused absences, see below) will result in a grade of F for the course. 

        It is your responsibility to be present and to take notes. If for _any_ reason--excused or unexcused--you must be absent, you should either send someone to take notes for you or arrange to borrow those of another member of the class (lending notes, however, is an act of generosity and is _not_ mandatory). Makeups of tests and other graded written work, i.e. excused absences, will be given only under the following circumstances: 

        a. Illness or injury serious enough to send you to a physician.   
        b. The funeral or life-threatening illness or injury of a member of the immediate family, defined as spouse, children, siblings, parents, or grandparents.   
        c. Students who are on scholarships and/or other grants-in-aid overseen by the University Scholarships and Awards Committee who can document that the terms of their scholarships require their participation in events or activities that conflict with the time of a scheduled examination or other written exercise.   
        d. While there may be other circumstances that could justify an excused absence, such decisions are solely at the professor's discretion. You must clear these with him before cutting the class and/or missing a written assignment or examination.   
    
    
  

  **Professor's Office Hours (Holtzendorff 208):**

MWF 9:05-11:00, 4:00-4:45; F 9:05-11:00.  Hours are available Tuesday and
Thursday by  
        appointment.   
Telephone: 656-5377 (office); 654-9309 (home); e-mail nichold@clemson.edu
(office);  
        nicholas@innova.net (home). No, I do not mind being called at home. If I did, I would not   
        provide you with address/number. 

        The Department of History has been moved to Holtzendorff Hall to permit the renovation of Hardin Hall, where History offices were previously located. Holtzendorff is the old YMCA building, near the edge of the campus toward downtown Clemson. To reach room 208, enter the building through the main door, take the stairs on the _right_ side of the lobby to the second floor, go through the double doors, and turn left.

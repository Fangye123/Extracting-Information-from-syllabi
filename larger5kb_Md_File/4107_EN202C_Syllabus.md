  **Catalog Description:** |

Prerequisite: 102.  A chronological survey of the major works and writers in
British literature from the Romantic through the Modern periods.  
  
---|---  
  
  **Course Goals:** |

The chief course goal is for the student to become familiar with the
masterpieces of British literature from the Romantic through the Victorian and
Modern periods.  Additional goals include the student's becoming conversant
with literary types, forms, and styles as well as gaining an appreciation of
his/her cultural heritage as it is expressed through literature.  The works
selected for study will be some of the best and most representative poems,
plays, stories, and novels drawn from the three periods of literary history
covered in the course.  To achieve the desired course goals, emphasis in study
will be placed upon literary theory, i.e. the _ars poetica_ of each writer as
it is reflected in specific works of literature, and also upon critical
analysis.   The student will become acquainted with additional works of
fiction and drama not included in the required texts through the preparation
of one collateral reading report.

  **Grading:** |

Grades will be based on study questions and classroom participation (10%), two
quizzes (20% ), two essays (20%), two exams (40%), and one collateral reading
report (10%).

---  
  
I.

|

Attendance and participation in class discussions are requirements of the
course.  If a student has a legitimate absence, he or she is still responsible
for the material discussed in class and for written assignments missed.  Each
student will be limited to **_three_ unexcused absences**. **_Six_ or** **more
absences of any kind (excused or unexcused)** will result in either a
reduction of a student's final grade by at least one letter or failure of the
course.  
  
  
II.  |

Essays and Other Written Assignments  
  
  
| A. For essay exams, put your name, the course name , and the date on the
first page.  Put the title of the paper at the top center of the next page.
Skip every other line.  Write on both sides of the page.  Blue books will be
used for assignments (except quizzes) written in class.  
  
| B. For essays prepared outside of class, write a title page, an outline, and
five typed pages of text.  Use the form recommended in _The Bedford Handbook_.
The two essays required in this course are not research assignments.  They are
critical analyses that do not require documentation of secondary sources.  A
student will need to support his or her ideas with quotations from primary
sources in _Norton_.   These quotations should be documented.  
  
| C. **All written assignments must be handed in for you to pass the course.**  
****  
|  D. Late Assignments: A student has one week beyond the due date to turn in
a late assignment.  For each week after the due date, a student's grade will
be reduced by one letter grade unless the student has a legitimate excuse.
The number of extensions may be limited at the instructor's discretion.  
  
III.  | No incomplete will be offered unless the student has consulted the
instructor before the end of the semester and has gained the instructor's
approval.

**A 332 History of Architecture and Interiors II - Syllabus**

**Dr. David M. Breiner**

**Spring 2002**



**Type of Course**

Conducted in a lecture format with occasional group discussions, this is a
three-credit required history/theory course for all students in the
architecture and interior design programs.

**Description**

The second course in a four-term sequence in the the history of architecture
and interiors, this class surveys key examples of Western and non-Western
architecture and interiors produced from the 7th to the early 17th centuries.
Students acquire a working vocabulary for both analyzing and evaluating the
built environment, as well as painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts.
Works are placed within a broad historical context by considering factors such
as religion, philosophy, iconography, the role of the artist or architect,
political and economic systems, materials and techniques, and construction
methods and technology.

**Prequisite**

Successful completion of A 331 History of Architecture and Interiors I

**Objectives**

The primary objectives of this course are to instill an:

| ![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| awareness of the theories and methods of
inquiry that seek to clarify the relationships between behavior and the
physical environment;  
---|---  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| awareness of the diversity of needs,
values, behavioral norms, and social and spatial patterns that characterize
different cultures, and the implications of this diversity for the societal
roles and responsibilities of architects;  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| understanding of the Western and non-
Western architectural canons and traditions in architecture, landscape, and
urban design from the 7th through the early 17th centuries , as well as the
climatic, technological, socioeconomic, and other cultural factors that have
shaped and sustained them; and  
![](_themes/expeditn/expbul1a.gif)| understanding of the shifts which occur --
and have occurred -- in the social, political, technological, ecological, and
economic factors that shape the practice of architecture (this is accomplished
by forming comparisons between artists, architects, and designers, diverse
periods and circumstances)

**Procedures**

During slide lectures, students are encouraged to discuss the material at hand
as well as take notes to assist them in studying for the three exams.
Unannounced quizzes will contribute to the grade on the final exam.  Students
will be required to visit the Philadelphia Museum of Art as part of their
research project.  A required field trip will be scheduled near the end of the
semester.



**Completion requirements**

The grade for this course is based on the following (a student missing an exam
or an assignment automatically fails the course):

Three exams (including quizzes)    60 %

Research project                                 30 %

Participation and attendance            10 %



**Exams**

Exams consist of slide identification, short answers based on slides, and
identification of key terms.  Students are responsible for works discussed in
class and reproduced in required textbooks or handouts.  Topics lists provide
the factual information you need to know (title of work,
artist/architect/designer, period, culture, location, and approximate date);
lectures and readings provide other important information about the works.
Make-up exams will not be given, unless the student can document a serious
illness or death in the family which conflicted with the exam.

**Participation and Attendance**

This grade will be determined be your ongoing contribution to class
discussions and your domonstrated knowledge of the material.  Class attendance
and promptness are critical for success in the course.  If you miss a class,
it is your responsibility to get notes and handouts from a classmate.  More
than five absences results in a final grade of "F" for the course; arriving
late for class three times is the equivalent of one absence.  All assignments
must be submitted on or before the deadline.  Eating and drinking in class are
not permitted.

Three components will be graded as follows:

100-93 = A; 92-90 = A-

89-87 = B+; 86-83 = B; 82-80 = B-

79-77 = C+; 76-73 = C; 72-70 = C-

69-67 = D+; 66-63 = D; 62-0 = F



**Honesty**

Cheating and plagiarism are prohibited by your Student Code of Conduct and
will be strictly enforced.  Even unintentional plagiarism is wrong and
ignorance will not be accepted as an excuse.  Plagiarists misrepresent the
ideas, words, or work that rightfully belong to another as their own.  The
proper use of the ideas, words, or word of another requires that you
acknowledge your source -- simply that you give your audience or reader all
the information needed to read or view the original source.

**Student Archives**

You are required to retain all work completed in this course.  Some student
work, representative of the course, will be photographed for the School's
records and some may become a permanent part of the archives.  We retain our
students' work because the assessment of student work is important in securing
accreditation by both FIDER (for interior design) and NAAB (for architecture).

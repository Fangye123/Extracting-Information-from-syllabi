**FALL 2002 Internship Assignment  
Criminal Justice 490**

Part of the experience of completing an internship is to gain work experience
that prepares you for your chosen profession. Likewise, bridging this
practical experience with an "educational" component is where your readings
and papers come in.

Please make sure that you are registered for the right number of credits!  
YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ADD THIS COURSE AFTER 3rd WEEK OF CLASSES.

Required textbooks and readings for the course should be purchased on-line as
soon as possible. Our office does not order them at WSU Bookstore.

  
**Paper:**  
You should select the topic that most closely matches your internship
experience and with which you are familiar. Your paper must be typed, double-
spaced and depending for how many credits you are registered from 10 pages
(for a 3-credit course) to 25 pages (for a 12-credit course) in length, and
have a minimum of 5 sources. Speak to me about the length of your paper.  
Base your paper on the assigned readings and other professional or scholarly
journals or newspapers. Proper citations are a must. Use APA format. You
should make a copy of your paper and submit the original by mail. You can also
submit an additional copy by electronic mail but make sure that it is in a
format that is easily downloaded. I suggest rich text format. Documents that
are gibberish or unreadable are classified as not submitted.  
The paper must have at minimum five sources. Possible sources can include
national journals or newspapers, such as: Congressional Quarterly, the Wall
Street Journal, NY. Times, etc. Other journals are also acceptable -
Commentary, National Review, New Republic \- be careful though, these have an
ideological slant. Government publications are also acceptable sources. You
may also use Internet sources but care should be taken in citing and
determining that they are legitimate and credible. I prefer government
websites (Thomas.gov),  "think-tank" sources (heritage.org etc.), and media
outlets (cnn.com). Make sure you cite them correctly - I should be able to
"pull them up" without a problem. If not, don't use them. Unfortunately
personal interviews with key representatives, lobbyists, etc. are not
acceptable because in many cases they require special permissions and can be
tricky and time consuming.  
Papers are graded primarily on the content but style, grammar, and form will
count. Carefully proof and edit your paper.  
Papers must have:  
" A title page  
" An introduction describing the topic and its importance (this should be
accomplished in the first two paragraphs)  
" A conclusion discussing what lessons your case study teaches about your
topic.  
" Bibliography

You should list your sources completely in the bibliography and make
references in the text in parentheses by author, year, and page numbers. For
example, if you wanted to cite welfare reform in a textbook written by L.
Sabato you would put the following (Sabato, 1999, pp.663). A full citing of
books should be listed in the bibliography. Consult a style manual for the APA
guidelines on citing. Do not assume you are doing it correctly.  
Major ideas and quotes taken from the sources must be cited. Failure to do so
is plagiarism and can result in a failure on the paper, class, and academic
expulsion from the University.  
Journal  
In addition to your paper you must also write a short (5-10) page journal
about your internship experience.  
This should include:  
" A description of the daily tasks you performed and highlight significant
learning experiences. You needn't recount a daily log of what you did - make
it a narrative.  
" Include your thoughts, perceptions, what you liked, didn't like, why you
feel the way you do, and in general terms what you learned, and whether you
believe the internship was a worthwhile experience.  
" Include some thought on the setting you worked in and how you perceive it
now that you have worked in the institution.  
" Finally, what are you plans for the future? Do you believe the internship
has helped you professionally toward your goal (if you have one), or somehow
clarified your thinking on a profession?

**Contact information:**  
You must provide me with your address, telephone numbers (home/ work), and if
possible and preferable your email address before you start your internship.
Periodic  "checking in" will be done. You are responsible for submitting other
required forms as well. PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION FORM to me as soon as
possible.

If you will have any problems at your work place please notify me AND your
supervisor (at the place of your internship) as soon as possible. Please act
professionally and be respectful to your colleagues and supervisors.

**Registering for Credit:**  
It is the responsibility of each student to register for credit (CrJ 490).
Failure to do so precludes one from gaining credit. This office will neither
register students nor retroactively assign credits. If you have questions
regarding this department policy please speak to the intern coordinator.

**Topic one: Policy Analysis**

1\. The books you are responsible for reading and which will aid in your
research project are:

Beyond Machiavelli: Policy Analysis Comes of Age, by Beryl Radin (2000)  
Agendas, Alternatives, and Policies, by John Kingdon, 2nd edition (1995)  
Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making, by Debra Stone 2nd
edition (1997)  
(Supplement with at least 2 recent journal or newspaper articles)

2\. Select a public policy topic concerning criminal justice that is of
personal interest, one worked on this legislative session and is being (or
was) considered by the Congress and President. (Examples include handgun
purchase restrictions, three strikes your our legislation, Megan's Law, etc.).
The topic is of your discretion (with my approval) but it must have been
seriously considered in Congress and either adopted or not adopted. The paper
should trace how the issue proceeded through the policy process and should
include the following stages outlined below. Students are responsible for
selecting an issue topic and having it approved by Monday, September 16th
2002.

3\. In your paper, consider the different stages of the policy process, and
attempt to answer each of the following questions:

a. The Policy Agenda: How did this problem become part of the government
agenda? What role did linkage institutions such as public opinion, the media,
political parties, elections, or interest groups play in putting this issue on
the agenda?  
b. Policy Formation: How did the proposed policy address the public problem?
In other words, what would this policy do or what was it supposed to do? How
was it formulated and by whom? (For example, by the Governor, Legislature, the
bureaucracy, interest groups, etc.)  
c. Policy Adoption: Describe the politics surrounding the consideration of
this policy. Who were the key actors (legislators, interest groups, agency
officials, the Governor, etc.) involved in determining whether the policy was
adopted or was not adopted? What role did other factors such as public opinion
and the political environment play in the outcome?  
d. Policy Implementation and Impact: If the policy was adopted, how was it
carried out, and what is its likely effect on society? If the policy was not
adopted, what are some of the potential consequences of its failure on
society?

4\. You are encouraged to express your own opinions in the conclusion, but the
assignment - your assessment of a policy -- is to be as objective as possible.
Do not write an editorial or diatribe slamming the President, Congress, the
Republicans, or Democrats. (I know this can be tempting and fun but resist it,
if you must, do it in your journal.) Write the paper as a neutral social
scientist trying to explain and analyze why a certain policy was/was not
adopted and why politics and institutions shaped that particular solution to a
problem.

**Topic two: Courts  
(for student in law firms, district attorneys offices, etc.)**

Plea-bargaining has become a routine facet of the American legal system. Some
argue that its practice allows criminals to get away with more serious
infractions of the law while others argue that it's unfair to the prosecuted
because they are often coerced into accepting a plea. Write a paper on why
plea-bargaining is so pervasive in American society. Begin by reading the
following books.

American Courts: Process and Policy, by Lawrence Baum (1998)  
Politics of plea-bargaining: Victim's rights in California, by Candace McCoy
(1993)

Betrayal of Due Process: A Comparative Assessment of Plea Bargaining in the
United States and Canada by Hedieh Naheri (1998)

Inside plea bargaining: the language of negotiation, by Douglas W. Maynard
(1984)  
(Supplement with at least 2 recent journal or newspaper articles)  
  
Students are responsible for selecting an issue topic and having it approved
by Monday, September 16th 2002.

Your paper should include an examination of the following questions. Is plea-
bargaining unfair and/or irrational? Why is it so pervasive in our society?
Why have efforts at elimination of plea-bargaining been unsuccessful?

In writing this paper you should select a high profile case in order to focus
your attention and argument.  

**Topic Three: Policing  
(for students in juvenile justice, policing, corrections)**

Within the last few decades there have been numerous incidents involving
clashes between police and society. It is your responsibility to identify what
issues are currently creating conflict. Begin your writing by reviewing the
following books with journal articles as supplements.

Critical Issues in Policing, by Dunham and Alpert (2001)  
Police and Society, by Roberg (2000)  
(Supplement with at least 3 recent journal or newspaper articles)

Consider the following questions in your paper. Why is there the appearance of
a divide with respect to policing? Find and analyze 2 issues currently facing
the organization for which you are working. What is the nature of each issue?
Describe the problems, the groups involved, and the different values at play.
Why is there tension among some police departments and some communities? What
is responsible for this? What are the remedies? What approaches are being
tried and what have failed?

syntactic cueing strategies.  
2\. To examine methods for providing effective instruction in critical
reading.  
3\. To discuss the objectives of reading in the different content fields, and

process.  
4\. To identify the special growth, social strains, environmental factors
(home and social), and reading habits which affect reading as well as to
understand and be sensitive to differences among learners and how the
differences influence reading as well as understand the influence of school
programs on students' learning.  
5\. To understand how assessment and grouping procedures can influence
motivation and learning, and to provide flexible grouping based on students'
instructional levels, rates of progress, interests, or instructional goals.  
6\. To examine research and practices in the area of reading instruction which
complement and supplement reading instruction.  
7\. To understand the relationship of phonemic, morphemic, and semantic
syntactic systems of language to the reading process.  
8\. To strengthen students' reading abilities by embedding reading instruction
in a meaningful context for the purpose of accomplishing specific, authentic
tasks or for pleasure and to help students learn and apply comprehension
strategies for a variety of purposes.  
9\. To evaluate students' reading abilities and develop appropriate
instructional procedures to meet individual needs of students rather than
imposing prescribed, inflexible programs.  
10\. To select, design, modify and evaluate diagnostic tools in a specific
content area, use that tool to evaluate students' reading abilities, prescribe
the most appropriate instructional practices and procedures to meet students'
individual needs, and understand the interactive nature and multiple causes of
reading difficulties.  
11\. To have knowledge of current and historical perspectives about the nature
and purpose of reading, of the importance of reading for language development;
listening ability; cognitive, social, and emotional development; perceptual
motor abilities; and about widely used approaches to reading instruction.

identification of the purpose for testing, listing specific types of tests,
defining validity and reliability, and interpretation of test results of Norm
Referenced Tests and Criterion Referenced Tests; recognizing assessment as an
ongoing and indispensable part of reflexive teaching and learning; and using
information from norm-referenced tests, formal and informal inventories,
constructed-response measures, portfolio-based assessment, observations,
anecdotal records, journals, and multiple other indicators of students'
progress to inform instruction and learning.  
13\. To recognize the value of reading aloud to learners and the importance of
using reading in positive ways in the classroom which models and discusses
reading as a valuable activity.  
14\. To recognize the value and importance of giving learners opportunities in

that involves a consideration of multiple indicators of learner progress and
that takes into account the context of teaching and learning; and recognizes
and understands the importance of aligning assessment and instruction.  


###  Course Rationale

    Students will be assigned a middle school or high school student and will tutor this student in a field-based instructional program in one or several content areas.  The content areas of mathematics, English, social studies, and science will be utilized to provide students the opportunity to instruct public school students in the content area(s) in which they will be certified.  Students will align content instruction with reading strategies/activities so that a knowledge of teaching reading in the content areas is mastered.  Students will create positive and supportive learning using activities such as:   
    1.    Interest Inventories   
    2.    Study Questionnaires   
    3.    Readability Formulas   
    4.    Objectives (content objectives with reading goals and objectives included)   
    5.    Prereading Activities (Previews, surveys, anticipation guides, conceptual conflicts, K-W-L, webbing, Semantic mapping, structured overviews, questions, etc.)   
    6.    Instructional Procedures including directed reading activities, Powerpoint presentations, reading guides, QAR (Question-and-answer relationships), trade books, software programs for content areas and reading skills, study guides, and activities to enhance comprehension for a wide variety of different types of learners (including ESL students).   
    7.    Assessments including a different type of assessment for each objective.

###  Relationship of Course to Conceptual Base:

    The Citadel's Department of Education has adopted [Learner Centered Education ](http://sysdyn.mit.edu/cle/home.html)as its conceptual base. This conceptual base provides several advantages over others that might be considered. These include:   
1\. It provides a conceptual base that can be embraced equally by all programs
within the department.  
2\. It focuses on the reason schools exist: helping all students learn more
effectively.  
3\. It establishes the learner as the most important and pivotal person in the
teaching-learning equation.  
4\. It provides a framework against which curricular development,
instructional strategies and tactics and assessment procedures can be
measured.  


###  Conceptual Base:

Definition of Learner-Centered Education:  
  Learner-centered education is defined by McCombs and Whisler (1997, p.9) as:  
the perspective that couples a focus on individual learners (their heredity,
experiences, perspectives, backgrounds, talents, interests, capacities, and
needs) with a focus on learning (the best available knowledge about learning
and how it occurs and about teaching practices that are most effective in
promoting the highest levels of motivation, learning, and achievement for all
learners). This dual focus, then, informs and drives educational decision-
making.  
Learner-centered education in this perspective embodies the learner and
learning in the programs, policies and teaching that support effective
learning for all students. Administrators are responsible for developing,
maintaining and enhancing a school environment that enhances effective
learning. They are also responsible for assuring teachers are knowledgeable
about their students and how learning best occurs. Teachers are responsible
for having classrooms that promote effective learning for all as well as being
familiar with the instructional techniques that promote effective learning for
all. School counselors are concerned with improving both the conditions for
learning (parent education, classroom environment, teacher attitude) as well
as assisting each learner develop his/her fullest potential. The following
five premises support these assertions.  
 1\. Learners have distinctive perspectives or frames of reference,
contributed to by their history, the environment, their interests and goals,
their beliefs, their ways of thinking and the like. These must be attended to
and respected if learners are to become more actively involved in the learning
process and to ultimately become independent thinkers.  
2\. Learners have unique differences, including emotional states of mind,
learning rates, and learning styles, stages of development, abilities,
talents, feelings of efficacy, and other needs. These must be taken into
account if all learners are to learn more effectively and efficiently.  
3\. Learning is a process that occurs best when what is being learned is
relevant and meaningful to the learner and when the learner is actively
engaged in creating his or her own knowledge and understanding by connecting
what is being learned with prior knowledge and experience.  
4\. Learning occurs best in an environment that contains positive
interpersonal relationships and interactions and in which the learner feels
appreciated, acknowledged, respected, and validated.  
5\. Learning is seen as a fundamentally natural process; learners are viewed
as naturally curious and basically interested in learning about and mastering
their world.  
A learner-centered conceptual base, as described above, serves as an
integrative framework for scholarly activity, curriculum development and
revision, teaching, and professional endeavors. Obviously, there is much more
supporting a learner-centered emphasis than provided above. Cognitive theory,
including metacognition, motivational and affective factors, development and
social attributes, and individual differences, to name just a few of the
critical variables are all involved. The central emphasis, and understanding,
that emerges from an integrated and holistic examination of a learner-centered
approach is that for educational systems to serve the needs of every learner,
it is essential that every instructional decision focus on the individual
learner - with an understanding of the learning process.  
This course is related to learner-Centered Education in the following manner.
Teaching Reading in Secondary Schools - Content Areas considers reading and
study skills affected by different academic disciplines as well as the role of
content area teachers and the teaching of reading. The course is designed to
teach students a variety of teaching techniques and methods to help the
students learn how to meet individual needs in educational settings, make
appropriate instructional decisions, and improve reading comprehension of
textbooks and trade books.  


###  Statement on Plagiarism and Consequences:

Students are encouraged to share ideas, methods, and teaching techniques with
each other. Time will be allowed in class to meet in collaborative groups to
share and discuss ideas. Students are also encouraged to proofread each
other's work.  
Although idea sharing is encouraged, students should not directly copy
someone's words. Ideas should be adapted and adjusted to meet the individual
needs of the students. Word-by-word copying and identical assignments are
considered Honor Code Violations.  


###  Statement on Special Requirements:

**Field Experience Requirements:**

    We will be working with The Citadel GEAR UP Summer Camp.  There are 6 required hours of field experiences associated with this class.  The GEAR UP Summer Camp operates from 8:30 - 2:30 Monday - Friday June 3rd - 14th.  We have several options which will be discussed the first day of class.  The field experience will  be designed to meet your schedule as well as the requirements for the course. 

You are responsible for keeping a journal of your activities. For the most
part, the journal entries include the day, time, name of student, and a
description of the activities.

**PowerPoint Presentation Directions:**  
    The PowerPoint is to be developed from the unit of instruction that you are developing.  The following requirements must be included:   
            1.    5 slides   
            2.    an image   
            3.    animation of the text or image 

###  Statement of Evaluation Procedures and Weights for Assignments:

There are no written exams. The above assignments are designed to allow the
students the opportunity to completely plan a unit of content instruction
including necessary reading instruction. All assignments will focus upon that
topic. If you are currently teaching in a school, you may want to choose a
topic that will be taught in your classes at school.

If the assignment is not on the A level of quality, it will be returned for
revision and improvement. There is no grade deduction for returned
assignments. If the assignment is not resubmitted or does not reach the "A"
level, the student will receive an "F" for that assignment.  Resubmit
assignments should be turned in for reevaluation no later than 2 weeks after
the assignment has been returned for corrections.  
The objective is to complete a unit of instruction of A quality work. All
assignments are to be kept in the portfolio.

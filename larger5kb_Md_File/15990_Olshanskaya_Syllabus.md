> **Syllabus  
>  Course Title: Russian Culture Through Cinema  
>  Course Objectives:** The course will provide an overview of the most
significant trends and periods in the development of Russian cinema. It will
concentrate on three major aspects:  
>  1.Cinema as Art: the development of main genres and styles in Russian
cinema. Major directors and productions.  
>  2\. Myths of the Nation: politics and history in Russian cinema.
"Socialist realism" and its impact on the cultural development of cinema.  
>  3.Self and the Other: race, ethnicity, gender. New trends and themes in
Russian culture.  
>  In this course, students will analyze cinema as a formal and cultural
construct. They will study the formal properties of cinema, come to understand
how cinematic images and narratives affect audiences' views, learn how to
analyze cinema both as self-contained, discrete texts and its functioning in
larger aesthetic and historical contexts.

Course Syllabus - HS 182  
American Civilization II

> **Course Description:  
>  ** This course is a one-semester survey of the key developments in U.S.
history from the Reconstruction to the present. While text readings will shed
light on politics and foreign policy, special emphasis will be given in class
to social developments and real people's experiences. Particular attention
will be paid to issues facing women, blacks, and ethnic minorities. In
addition, students will become familiar with different perspectives and
approaches to writing history.  
>  
>  **  
> Reading List:

>  **Writing Assignments:** 30% of Grade  
>  Students will complete two writing assignments due March 13 and April 17.
Assignments will be handed out approximately ten days before the due date.
Students are encouraged to discuss their papers with me and to have someone
look over their rough drafts. Papers are due at the beginning of the class
period. I will not accept late submissions, OCF-related delays, negligent
roommates, or other excuses.  
>  
>  **Discussion and Attendance:** 30% of Grade  
>  **  
> Discussion:**  
>  Students are expected to contribute regularly and significantly to weekly
class discussions. A discussion grade will be assigned based on students'
performance at these weekly sessions. Although regular and active
participation is expected, students who fail to read the assignment and try to
"fake" discussion will not be given any more credit than other students that
are not prepared.  
>  **  
> Attendance:**  
>  Attendance will be taken at every class meeting. Woody Allen is credited
with coining the expression,  "95% of life is showing up." With Allen's wisdom
in mind, students will be given a grade for their attendance to class meetings
and discussion. This attendance grade will be figured in the following manner:
|  0-2 absenses  
>  3-4 absenses  
>  5-6 absenses  
>  7+ absenses **** |  A  
>  B  
>  C  
>  **F** |  
> ---|---|---|---  
>  
>  
>  I reserve the following discretionary rights: (1) to decide whether to
admit students who enter the classroom late, (2) whether or not to count late
arrivals as absenses, and (3) to excuse an absense due to a family or personal
emergency.  
>  
>  **Journal:** 15% of Grade  
>  
>  Students will be expected to keep a journal of their reactions to the
discussion readings. These journal entries are brief personal responses to the
weekly reading assignments that students should bring with them to class each
discussion, along with the reading assignment for the day. (NOTE: Journal
entries are not for the textbook reading assignment. They are designed for the
reading material we will discuss in class.) Journals will be collected from
each student once or twice during the semester. Each week in discussion, I
will collect several journals from students chosen at random. **No advance
warning will be given before the journals are collected. No make-ups will be
given to students who come to class without journals or who fail to show up to
discussion.**  
>  I recommend students keep journals in the black and white  "Composition"
books that can be purchased at the bookstore.  
>  Students should write short reactions (ie. two or three paragraphs) to the
weekly discussion readings.  
>  There is no need to type these entries, but please write in ink in a clear,
legible manner.  
>  
>  **Examinations:**  
>  Midterm/Final ID's: 25% of Grade  
>  Exams will be given in class. Students will complete a fifty minute midterm
on February 27 and an exam on April 29. Both exams will consist of
identifications.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES**

This class will explore the literature of the American South and some of the
historical and social contexts of that literature. We will read essays, short
stories, and novels by Southern authors in order to come to conclusions about
the ways that Southern literature has shaped notions of self-identity and
regionalism.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS& POLICIES**

This class is an introduction to interpreting literature course; therefore, we
will spend considerable time understanding what interpreting literature
entails. To this end, this class involves a weekly writing assignment, two
five-page academic essays, an oral presentation, and a final examination. You
will receive an assignment sheet for the academic essays. You will also keep a
journal of your responses to the reading, which I will grade several times
throughout the term.

**Participation and Attendance:** I expect you to come to class prepared to
actively participate in discussion and group activities. Thus, attendance is
necessary and expected. If you have to miss a class for any reason, it is your
responsibility to find out what you missed and to turn in all assignments. If
you have more than  three unexcused absences, your grade will suffer. I will
ask several students, on a rotating basis, to prepare questions for small
group discussion.

**Short Writing Assignments and Quizzes:** Especially during the first part of
the term, you will be learning many terms that enable you to talk about
literature effectively. You will be quizzed on this terminology and relevant
historical data in addition to your comprehension of the daily reading
assignment. Also, I will assign and grade short weekly writing assignments.

**Reading Journal:** You will be expected to take notes on your reading in a
spiral notebook dedicated to the purpose of recording your reading of each
text with comments, interpretations, and questions you have. Keep, in the back
of the notebook, a vocabulary list of the dictionary definitions of new words
encountered in your reading. You might find it useful to keep a section of
your notebook dedicated to your observations about how some of the readings
challenge or change your previously held impressions of the South, its people,
its institutions, and its literature. You may also find it useful to keep
another section of the Reading Journal to record your developing readings of
the novels. Bring your Reading Journal to class with you daily for reference.
It will also be collected several times throughout the term for grading as to
its seriousness of purpose, its development, and the quality of writing and
observation in it.

**Two Essays:** There will be two formal essays in this class. The essay
topics for these will be handed out well in advance.

**Oral Presentation:** During the first week of class each student will choose
a topic related to but not covered in course readings about which he or she
will do additional research outside of class. Think broadly about interesting
personalities, media, political and social events, legal decisions, and other
features pertaining to Southern culture or literature. Each student is then
responsible for presenting the findings of his or her research in a 10 to 15
minute presentation and then relating this research to class readings and
beginning class discussion. I encourage you to bring handouts, prepare a
reading or dramatic performance, present visual or audio tape, or whatever you
feel will enhance the interest of your topic. The oral presentation should be
entertaining and informative. After each student has chosen his or her topic,
I will assign a presentation schedule to ensure students' presentations relate
to the scheduled readings. You are required to meet with me before your
presentation to tell me what you have learned and how you intend to present
your material.

**Final Examination:** There will be a final exam that will include
identification of crucial dates, figures, or literary works; identification of
items according to author and title of work where they are found or as to
which they are relevant about which you should be able to briefly explain
their relevance; identification of quotations from texts that you should be
able to identify (both by work and author) and explain its place and meaning
for the work as a whole; and an essay question in which you will demonstrate
your understanding of literary interpretation.

**PLAGIARISM**

All work submitted in this course must be your own and be written exclusively
for this course. The use of sources (ideas, quotations, paraphrases, etc.)
must be properly documented in MLA format. In cases where plagiarism is
clearly established, the student will receive at best an F for a final grade
in the course, and the incident will be recorded in a confidential file with
the Vice Chancellor of Academic Affairs and Dean. At worst, the student may be
suspended. Please see me if you have any questions or concerns about
plagiarism. Bottom line: Don't do it!

**STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES**

If you have a documented disability (physical or learning) that you think may
affect your performance in this class, please see me during the first week of
the term and supply me with both written documentation and a written request
for any necessary accommodations, if any, so we can make arrangements for your
full access to classroom activities.

**MISCELLANEOUS**

* All out-of-class work is to be typed with standard (Times New Roman or Arial 12-point) font and one inch margins. All in-class written assignments must be legibly written or printed in blue or black ink on standard-sized white, lined notebook paper, unless otherwise specified.

* **A note on late assignments:** I do not like late assignments. In fact, I do not accept them. If you have a reasonable and acceptable (i.e., medical or family) excuse, and discuss it with me personally ahead of time, I will grant you an extension. However, if you simply do not turn in the assignment with no explanation, do not expect me to grade it when you get around to turning it in. 

* There will be no opportunities for extra credit work

* My office hours are held for your benefit. Please take advantage of these hours and meet with me if you have any questions about the course, readings, assignments, etc.

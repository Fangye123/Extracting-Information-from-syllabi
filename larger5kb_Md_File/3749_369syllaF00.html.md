**Purpose of the course:**  
This course seeks to acquaint each student with the political, social, and
religious history of the Jews from the times of Biblical origins to the year
1000 CE.

**Requirements:**  
In addition to attending class, reading, and participating in class
discussions, students are required to pass three examinations to be given at
the 5th week, 12th week, and during the final examination period. The exams
will consist of brief factual questions and essays. The educational goal of
the exams is to give students a structured opportunity to rethink and fix in
mind the facts and ideas presented in the course.

**4th credit:**  
Four credit students will be required to attend a weekly discussion. The
discussion time will be divided between questions raised by the lectures and a
deeper discussion of certain lecture topics selected by the instructor. In
addition, four credit students will be required to write a ten-page paper, on
a topic that grows out of historical texts studied in class. Four-credit
students will be asked to compose the paper over the course of the term,
consulting with the instructor over choice of a topic, an outline of the
paper, a first draft, and a final draft.

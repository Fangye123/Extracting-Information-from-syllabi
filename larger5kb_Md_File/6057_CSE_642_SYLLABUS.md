#### TOPICS:

CSE 642 is a second graduate course in AI covering programming techniques for
AI and surveying AI topics not covered in other graduate-level courses. Topics
vary according to instructor and student interests. During Spring 2001, the
topic will be:

Computational Theories of Contextual Vocabulary Acquisition  
---  
  
As part of an interdisciplinary project to develop a computational cognitive
model of a reader of narrative text, we are developing a computational theory
of how natural-language-understanding systems can automatically acquire new
vocabulary by determining from context the meaning of words that are unknown,
misunderstood, or used in a new sense. 'Context' includes surrounding text,
grammatical information, and background knowledge, but no external sources.
Our thesis is that the meaning of such a word _can_ be determined from
context, can be _revised_ upon further encounters with the word, " _converges_
" to a dictionary-like definition if enough context has been provided and
there have been enough exposures to the word, and eventually " _settles down_
" to a "steady state" that is always subject to revision upon further
encounters with the word. The system is being implemented in the [SNePS
knowledge-representation and reasoning
system](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/sneps).

During the course, we will be reading through as much as possible of the large
literature in computational linguistics, reading education, and second-
language (L2) learning that is concerned with what is variously called
"vocabulary acquisition _from_ context", "vocabulary acquisition _in_
context", " _incidental_ vocabulary acquisition", "word-sense disambiguation",
etc.

#### READING:

  1. **THE COURSE WILL BE RUN AS A SEMINAR.** Thus, you will be expected to read and give oral presentations on several papers from the online bibliography (or elsewhere), as mutually agreed upon. You are strongly encouraged to read the papers that other students will be presenting. 

  2. See ["How to Read (a Computer Science Text)".](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtoread.html) 

#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS:

  1. You should subscribe to, and regularly monitor, the newsgroup [`sunyab.cse.642`](news:sunyab.cse.642). You may post questions and comments there that are of general interest to the entire class. From time to time, information about readings, etc., will be posted to the newsgroup. This newsgroup will be archived in the [CSE 642 Newsgroup Archive](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/642/news.txt). 

  2. There are two main requirements: 

    * You must _attend_ virtually all classes, _actively participate_ in class discussions, and _be prepared to give your oral presentations on time_. 

    * There will be a _term project_. This will be a 10-15-page, "typed", double-spaced _report_ (which may, but need not, include an appendix detailing a computational implementation). 

The final report for an implementation project must include an appendix (
_beyond_ the 10-15-page report itself) with _annotated_ sample runs and the
_commented_ program code.

The report might be:

      * new tests of our current contextual-vocabulary-acquisition system 
      * an extension to the grammar 
      * a determination of which standard learning theory we currently use 
      * an investigation of other learning theories that might be relevant 
      * coding the background knowledge for an appropriate text 
      * a (partial) literature review of: 
        * computational theories of contextual vocabulary acquisition 
        * L1 theories of contextual vocabulary acquisition 
        * L2 theories of contextual vocabulary acquisition 
        * theories of context 
      * or any other mutually-agreed-upon topic. 

If several of you choose to work together on a team project, your report must
include a statement clearly outlining each person's contribution.

Your topic must be approved by me in advance, and a proposal (perhaps in the
form of an extended summary) of 6-8 "typed", double-spaced pages or--even
better--a first draft must be turned in no later than Tuesday, March 13\.

The term project is due no later than Thursday, May 3 (= the first day of
final exams). Late projects will be accepted at a full-letter-grade-per-day
discount (e.g., an A project, 1 day late, gets a B, not an A-).

  3. Students should notify [Prof. Rapaport](mailto:rapaport@cse.buffalo.edu) within the first two weeks of class if they have a disability which would make it difficult to carry out course work as outlined (requiring note-takers, readers, extended test time). 

#### HOW TO STUDY:

For general advice on how to study for _any_ course, see my web page, ["How to
Study"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html).

#### GRADING:

Your course grade will be determined primarily by the grade on your term
project, but will be adjusted to reflect such factors as attendance, class
participation, and the diligence (or lack thereof) of your oral presentations.

#### Incompletes:

It is University policy that a grade of Incomplete is to be given only when a
small amount of work or a single exam is missed due to circumstances beyond
the student's control, and that student is otherwise doing passing work. I
will follow this policy _strictly_! Thus, you should assume that I will _not_
give incompletes :-) Any incompletes that I might give, in a lapse of judgment
:-), will have to be made up by the end of the Fall 2001 semester. For more
information on Incomplete policies, see the web page,
["Incompletes"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Courses/incompletes.html).

#### ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:

While it is acceptable to discuss general approaches with your fellow
students, the work you turn in must be your own. **It is the policy of this
department that any violation of academic integrity will result in an F for
the course, that all departmental financial support including teaching
assistanceship, research assistanceship, or scholarships be terminated, that
notification of this action be placed in the student's confidential
departmental record, and that the student be permanently ineligible for future
departmental financial support.** If you have any problems doing the homeworks
or projects, consult the TA or Prof. Rapaport. Please be sure to read the
webpage, ["Academic Integrity: Policies and
Procedures"](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/undergrad/academicintegrity.html),
which spells out all the details of this, and related, policies.

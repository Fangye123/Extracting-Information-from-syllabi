**HIST 129B  
Science and Religion: The Trial of Galileo**

**  
** This course grapples with the thorny issue of the relationship between
science and religion. It will focus on perhaps the most in/famous chapter in
the history of that relationship, namely the trial of Galileo. While everybody
has heard of the Galileo's fate at the hands of the Catholic Church, most have
only a superficial knowledge of the incident. We, however, will be looking at
the Galileo affair in depth. Because Galileo's own works are available in good
English translations along with a volume of the most important documents
relating to the trial, we can now investigate the story in the comfort of our
own seminar room.  
  
We will be looking at some important questions. What exactly was Galileo's
crime? Was the Church's treatment of him exceptional, or was his case quite
standard? Where does his case fit into the history of the relationship between
science and religion in Europe? Come to think of it, what is actually
contained in the terms science and religion? Are they really incompatible or
is the whole thing just a media beat-up?  
  
To give us some perspective on the issue, we will be examining a few other
case studies and will be reading some of the more stimulating and adventurous
interpretations of the Galileo affair. To hone our critical thinking skills,
we will also be examining the contemporary media to see what the trial of
Galileo has to teach us about the relationship between science and religion in
our own times.

**Course requirements:  
** All elements of the course requirements are mandatory. Failure to complete
them will result in failing the course.  
  
**In-class presentations:  
** All participants will be required to make an in-class presentation of
around 10 minutes. Your task is to introduce the session's reading and raise
questions for discussion. You are strongly advised to meet with me a week in
advance to prepare for the presentation. You then have one week to submit a
four-page write-up of the presentation.  
  
**Class participation:  
** As this is a seminar and not a lecture course, class participation is
essential. This means you must do the readings and come to class prepared to
discuss them. Four unexcused absences will result in failing the course.  
  
**Reading the media:  
** During the course we will be discussing pieces on science and religion
taken from the contemporary media. Please clip articles from the newspaper or
Internet news sites and bring them to class. We will devote the whole of the
last session to such discussions.  
  
**Writing-intensive course:  
** This course fulfils the Brandeis writing intensive course requirement.
Throughout the course we will be spending time discussing and practising
various elements of writing, from elementary components such as grammar and
syntax to more complex elements such as rhetoric and constructing arguments.
You will also have to submit short (ca. 2 page) papers on each of the major
readings.  
  
**Long paper:  
** The bulk of the final grade depends on a long paper (ca. 20-25pp). In this
paper you will present your interpretation of the Galileo Affair, based on the
primary and secondary sources that we will be reading and the comparative case
studies we will be looking at. A draft of the paper will be due on Wednesday
19 April. The final draft will be due Thursday 2 May.  
  
**Assessment:  
** Class participation and book write-ups: 20%  
Presentation and write-up: 20%  
Long paper: 60%  
  
**Academic honesty:  
** Brandeis University rigorously upholds high standards of academic
integrity. Plagiarism, that is, claiming other people's work to be your own,
is theft and deceit. If you have any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism
please consult with me. Any student caught committing plagiarism will be
subject to severe penalties. I would refer you to the Brandeis University
Bulletin and the Student Handbook for a list of possible penalties.

**Course Objectives**  
This three credit-hour course provides a live and up-to-date coverage of a
broad spectrum of macroeconomic issues dealing with the long-run and short-run
performance of the economy. We begin by issues regarding the construction and
historical performance of several important macro variables including output,
labor productivity, employment, inflation, and real wage. Our next task is to
examine the long-run and short-run behavior of these variables as well as the
factors that contribute to such performance. To do so, we construct a general
equilibrium macro-model consisting of three markets: the commodity market, the
labor market, and the money market.

Required Background  
Students enrolled in this course are expected to have completed courses in
principles of economics, statistics, and mathematics, and have working
knowledge of a word-processing software (MS Word) and a spreadsheet software
(MS Excel).

**Required Course Materials**  
1\. The required text for this course is Macroeconomics, by Andrew B. Abel and
Ben S. Bernanke, 2001,4th Edition, Addison-Wesley. This text is the primary
source for most of my lectures as well as the homework assignments.

2\. Macroeconomics is very dynamic. There are day-to-day social, political and
economic events that affect the economy. I expect each of you to keep track of
these events, and as you develop your analytical skills, be able to analyze
their economic consequences. There are many good sources for current
information, including the Wall Street Journal, the Economist, and many online
sources such as CNBC.com.

3\. You should become familiar with alternative sources of time-series data on
domestic and international macro variables. Some good sources include
[Economic Report of the
President](http://w3.access.gpo.gov/usbudget/fy2002/pdf/2001_erp.pdf), [World
Economic
Outlook](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2000/02/data/index.htm#avail),
[NBER](http://www.nber.org/databases/macrohistory/contents/index.html),
Federal Reserve regional banks, and International Financial Statistics (IFS).
A detailed list of online data sources is available at [Economic and Social
Data.](http://hsb.baylor.edu/html/gardner/ECOSTAT.HTM)

**Course Requirements**  
Your performance in this course is evaluated based on four exams, and 6-8
weekly homework assignments.  
**Exams**  
Exams are designed to help monitor your progress in understanding the subject.
They are also used as the primary criteria for your course grade. They may
consist of a combination of multiple-choice, essays, and problems. The final
exam is designed to evaluate your overall understanding and retention of the
core materials covered in this course.

**Homework Assignments**  
As you know, the best way to master any subject is through practice and
problem solving. Such is also the case in economics. Primarily for this
reason, you will receive weekly homework assignments. For the most part,
assignments are selected from the end-of-chapter questions and problems, and
are related to the lecture. In organizing your homework, you will follow a set
of instructions that I will provide you at a later date. For the benefit of
cooperation, I encourage working on problems through study teams.

**Grading and Evaluation**  
The following table summarizes the information on points, weights, and
tentative dates for the exams and homework assignments:

|    |  Points (%) | Date  
---|---|---  
Exam 1 | 100 (20%) | 14 February  
Exam 2 | 100 (20%) | 14 March  
Exam 3 | 100 (20%) | 11 April  
Exam 4 | 100 (20%) | 9 May  
Homework | 100 (20%) | Announced weekly  
Total | 600 (100%) |  
  
  
Your grade distribution is based on the following schedule:

500-440 (100%-88%) |

A  
  
---|---  
439-390 (87%-78%) |

B  
  
389-340 (77%-68%) |

C  
  
339-290 (68%-58%) |

D  
  
289 and below (67% and below) |

F  
  
**Optional Research Project**  
Those of you who like to accumulate extra credits, may do so by completing a
5-to-7 page research project for a maximum of 15 bonus points. The project
should address a macroeconomic issue, examine its history, and explain it
using existing theories. Some reasonable topics include inflation,
unemployment, interest rates, exchange rates, consumption spending, investment
spending, recessions, and the like. The paper should be typed, have at least
four references, and be written in your own words. Finally, the paper should
be organized into the following four sections:  
A. Introduction  
B. Main body of the text  
C. Summary and Conclusions  
D. References  
Please plan to see me earlier in the semester if you plan to complete the
research project.

**How to Get the Most Out of This Course**  
1\. Please keep up with your readings. We will cover a substantial amount of
new information in each lecture. It is fairly impossible to read and
understand the materials just before each exam. Also, since the subjects are
accumulative, difficulties with one might cause serious hindrance in
understanding other subjects. The followings are a few common sense tips you
may consider in preparing yourself prior to each class:  
a. Read the assigned chapter;  
b. Read the chapter summary at the end of each chapter;  
c. Print a copy of my lecture materials from my website, review it, and bring
it with you to the class. My address is www.econ.ilstu.edu/hmohamma.  
d. Always ask clarifying questions if you feel the subject is still ambiguous.

2\. Please take your homework assignments seriously. There are at least two
benefits of doing so: They provide valuable insights into fairly sophisticated
materials, and are common source of questions or the exams.

3\. Please attend classes regularly. Please inform me of scheduled absences,
provide me with a schedule of all semester absences, and arrange to complete
missed class work in advance. Ultimately, you are responsible for materials
covered in class.

4\. Please note that make-up examinations will be given only for documented
emergencies and sickness, and must be scheduled prior to the examination date.

**If You Need To See Me**  
I encourage you to see me in my office if you have any questions about the
course materials. The best way to do that is by visiting me during my posted
office hours. If inconvenient, you may set up an appointment by calling me at
438-7777 or contacting me via email at hmohamma@ilstu.edu.

**Preparing for an Exam**  
Being well prepared for an exam is an ongoing process rather than a desperate
bout of last minute cramming. Assimilating information at a pace that is
spread evenly throughout the semester usually leads to better comprehension
and longer retention. Therefore, in addition to what has been suggested above,
I recommend the followings:

(a) Review the material covered in class that very day. If you get into the
habit of rewriting your lecture notes as has been suggested above, this will
be sufficient review. If something doesn't make sense, be sure to have me
explain it to you again before the end of the week.

(b) Do all the homework questions that are assigned, whether they are for
credit or not.

(c) Use the study guide (if available). It is always a good idea to go through
all the problems for any given chapter. The best time to do that is when the
class has just finished with that chapter and is ready to move to the next.

(d) Use the author's website. The site provides a summary list of concepts,
multiple choice questions, exercises, worked out questions, power point
presentations, related links, the Conference Board data set, glossary of main
concepts, and many other useful resources. The site's address is
www.awlonline.com/abel_bernanke.

(e) Allocate sufficient time for studying. Start studying specifically for the
exam at least two or three days prior to the exam. Be sure to give yourself
enough time to go over all the materials that will be on the exam. When doing
a final review, go over what you have previously highlighted in the text, your
lecture notes, and chapter summaries.

**Taking a Test**  
If you have followed the recommendations above, this part is not going to be
very difficult.

(a) Be confident.

(b) Read the questions on the test carefully. Try to understand what is being
asked. It usually helps if you draw a diagram as part of your answer or for
yourself.

(c) Before handing in the test, check for careless mistakes.  

**Course Outline**

  
The textbook covers most of what you will study in this class. There are some
topics, however, where we need to go beyond the text. In that case, you will
need to depend upon your lecture notes. Where appropriate, I will provide you
with printed handouts to supplement those lecture notes.

There are some sections of your text that are relatively simple to comprehend.

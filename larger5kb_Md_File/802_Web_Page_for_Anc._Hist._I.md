.  THE COURSE.  During this semester, we will study the development of western
civilization--our civilization--from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern
farming villages more than 10,000 years ago to the Hellenistic civilization
fostered by the conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when
humankind emerged from cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to
build cities, and to devise the complex system of social relationships we call
civilization. We will see how the invention of writing allows the study of
"history," and how it allows us to observe the systems of government, society,
and laws of the ancients. Through preserved ancient writing, we will also
observe the formation of states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that
recurs with infinite variations over and over throughout the brief period of
humankind's recorded history.  This course will try to demonstrate how similar
we are in many ways to our ancient relatives, and how our basic
characteristics as a species remain unchanged. Due to the span of time we
examine, we will be moving quickly from one period to another, and the effect
may at times be confusing.  Hang in there. I promise that it will all come
together.  Above all I want to get you to think and to analyze, to question
"facts" and to develop your own opinions, for these are the true benefits of
studying history.  
---  
.  THE BOOKS.  Our basic modern texts for this course are:  
**     Knapp = **A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western Asia
& Egypt._ 4th ed.  
        Chicago, 1988.    
**     Martin = **[Thomas Martin. _Ancient Greece._   Yale Univ. Press.
1996.](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=trm+ov+toc)  
We will also examine original sources from:  
**     Bailkey = **N.M. Bailkey. _Readings in Ancient History._ Lexington,
Mass. 5th ed., 1996.  
---  
.  INTERNET RESOURCES: During this semester you should become familiar with
the online Perseus Project database (<http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/>), which
contains Greek texts in translation (and the original), an
[atlas](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/atlas), a collection of useful
[images](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/art&arch.html) (e.g.: coins, sites,
artifacts, buildings), an [encyclopedia](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/text?lookup=encyclopedia+toc), an [historical
overview](http://hydra.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/text?lookup=trm+ov+toc),
bibliography and [other research
tools](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/lexica.html).  I may design a few brief
written exercises for you based on these and other internet materials.  
---  
.  ADDITIONS TO THE COURSE WEB PAGE: In general, I will use the on-line
syllabus to communicate with you between classes.  It would be a good idea to
check the on-line syllabus regularly for updates
(http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_00.htm).  
---  
.  REQUIREMENTS OF THE COURSE.  There will be two map quizzes, and two in-
class essay exams.  In order to "help" you keep up with your reading
assignments, there will be **_simple_** quizzes at the beginning of most class
periods.   The quizzes are designed to see if you have read the assignments
**_and will necessarily be of a general nature_**.   The first essay exam will
constitute 25% of your grade, the second one 50% and the quizzes, class
participation, written exercises and attendance the remaining 25%.  Some
important concepts and issues will be presented only in class, and for this
reason, class participation forms a significant portion of the final grade.

**COURSE OBJECTIVE:** I strongly believe in and uphold the ethics of learner-
centered education. This means students are the primary agents of learning and
must take initiative as well as risks when entering unknown territory.
Education is about intellectual development; it has intrinsic moral value and
is not a "product" to be bought or consumed. Learning and teaching demand
courage because we confront new challenges and difficult situations. If we are
honest in this work, we will discover our strengths and weaknesses, and
ultimately this process will result in personal growth-our true goal. In this
class, the discussions, lectures, reading and writing assignments, and
occasional video will provide students with an opportunity to gain a
fundamental understanding of the characteristic patterns of American history
as well as a basic knowledge of the developmental events that occurred during
the period covered. This course, like all Humanities, is reading and writing
intensive and will expose students to _conflicting_ ideas about the past that
have been developed by historians and other Americans. The **primary
objective** of the course is to help students arrive at their _own_
interpretation of American history as a way of reaching a personal
understanding of the society in which we live. To achieve this goal, students
will be **expected** to develop and apply several important skills, resulting
in these **course outcomes** :  
    1\. Become familiar with a body of historical knowledge (content) through reading, writing, and study.   
    2\. Think critically about and analyze historical forces that shaped the Asian religions and philosophies covered,   
        and that still influence the lives of over two billion people today.   
    3\. Demonstrate an ability to discuss historical, religious, and philosophical ideas and theories, and form arguments   
        about their historical significance, using clear oral and written communication. 

**REQUIRED READING** : Please purchase the following materials.  
1\. Roark, et.al., _The American Promise: A History of the United States, vol.
I to 1877_ , _Compact Edition_ (2000).  
2\. Binder and Reimers, _The Way We Lived: Essays and Documents in American
Social History, vol. I: 1492-1877_ , 4th ed. (2000).  
3\. Also purchase at least 3 Exam Books in the Book Store, you need at least 1
new exam book for each exam.

**STATEMENT OF INTENT:** This is a _writing to learn_ class and requires _more
work_ than other non-writing to learn American history classes. In this
course, there will be frequent writing assignments to help you develop and
practice your ability to analyze historical events and think critically about
their causes, consequences, and significance. The writing assignments will
include short, in-class exercises and a critical book essay on the Linda Brent
autobiography. There will also be essay questions on the exams that will
require you to write clearly and concisely about what you are learning in the
class.

**PHILOSOPHY OF WRITING:** The ability to write well is one of the most
important skills you need for your future, regardless of your chosen field of
employment. There are general characteristics of good writing that apply to
all fields, but all areas also have their own unique requirements. Writing for
your English class will be a little different from writing for your biology
class, etc. This is one of the reasons for the PSU writing to learn program -
to help you develop the ability to write in different ways to meet different
requirements. Good writing in history is a combination of two key elements.
Fundamental knowledge of _historical information_ (events, personalities,
chronology) is the basic element that forms the "nuts-and-bolts" of history.
Critical analysis, the _interpretation_ of historical information, is the
crucial element that helps us have a real understanding of the past. The only
way to be effective in combining these key elements intelligently is to
practice reading history and writing history. The assignments in this course
are designed to help students practice this process and be successful.
**Ultimately, history is about understanding the past in order to make some
sense of the present.** It is **not** about simply memorizing dates, names,
and places.

**EXAMINATIONS:** (Please refer to the COURSE SCHEDULE.) There will be two
Midterm Exams valued at 100 pts., and one Final Exam also valued at 100 pts.
Each Exam covers the section of the course that immediately precedes it (e.g.,
Midterm I covers Unit I). **There will be no make-ups or early exams for the
Final, except as allowed by the Dean.** All exams will include material from
the required readings, discussions, and lectures, and will consist of
objective questions and essay questions. Buy **exam books** ("blue books") at
the Book Store and bring a new one to all exams; they cost twenty cents each.

**COLLABORATIVE LEARNING:** Learner-centered education includes students
learning **with** **each other** ; to facilitate this, there will be six (6)
collaborative learning discussion assignments valued at 20 pts. each (SEE
COURSE SCHEDULE). The six assignments are over selected chapters from Binder &
Reimers, _The Way We Lived_ , **that must be read before class**. Each
assignment will include questions over the readings to be answered in writing
by discussion groups in class on the scheduled discussion days. Collaborative
learning groups will be formed randomly on the first discussion day, and each
group will be responsible for ensuring that each of its members makes a
contribution to the work. Students will be graded on their participation in
the group discussions and contributions to the writing assignments (worth 10
pts.), **_and_** their participation in the general class discussions that
follow the group work on the assigned days (worth 10 pts.). Only five of the
assignments will count towards the total for the semester, equaling 100 pts.
This means you can earn up to 20 **_Extra Points_** if you make a perfect
score on all six discussion assignments. **HOWEVER, NO MAKEUPS WILL BE ALLOWED
FOR THE COLLABORATIVE LEARNING EXERCISES, _NO EXCEPTIONS_.**

**IN-CLASS WRITING ASSIGNMENTS:** Every **TUESDAY** there will be an in-class
writing assignment over the required reading for that week (one chapter per
week from Roark, _The American Promise_ ) during the first 10-15 minutes of
class. The format of these assignments will vary: mini-essays about some of
the content of the chapter, a paragraph on the significance of an event from
the chapter, etc. These exercises will help you practice your general writing
skills, and help you start to develop your ability to write about history. The
goal of the in-class writing assignments is to help you make slow, but steady
progress during the semester in achieving the course objectives outlined
above. **I will be looking for progress, not perfection.** Every Tuesday we
will have a short discussion of the assignments after everyone turns them in
to help you improve. There will 15 total in-class writing assignments, valued
at 10 pts. each. The maximum total for the semester on these assignments will
be 120 points, which means there will be a 30 pt. "cushion" to allow for low
scores on a "bad day," for missed classes, and for **_Extra Points_**.
**HOWEVER, NO MAKEUPS WILL BE ALLOWED FOR THE IN-CLASS WRITING ASSIGNMENTS,
_NO EXCEPTIONS_.**

**FINAL EVALUATION:** Final grade calculation:

2 mid-term exams X 100 pts ea. = 200 pts
A= 600-540  
1 final exam          X 100 pts       = 100
B= 539-480  
5 collaborative groups X 20 pts   = 100
C= 479-420  
in-class writing assignments          = 120
D= 419-360  
participation points                      =   _80_  
                                                      600 

**ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION, and MAKEUP POLICY:** Participation means in-class
speaking, in-class activities, and active, responsive listening. Participation
is a crucial element in this class. It includes in-class activities and
discussions. Simply showing up for class does not by itself constitute
participation. You are expected to present your informed ideas as well as to
listen and show respect for the others in the classroom. **Participation is
mental attendance in the course**. You will be graded on how much you
contribute to the learning environment of the class; if you do not add
anything to the class, then you will not receive a good participation grade.
This means several things: **(1)** not attending class physically will not
help your participation grade; **(2)** contributing to discussions can only
help your grade in this class; if you do not talk, then you are adding nothing
useful to the discussions; **(3)** simply repeating what the person before you
has said, with no new insights, does not add anything to the discussions;
**(4)** inter-rupting someone else, talking while others are talking, talking
during videos, sleeping, showing disrespect to others, showing up late to
class, etc., does not contribute to the class. Because this behavior is a
hindrance to other students' learning, it will be penalized. **Repeated
behavior that has a negative effect on the learning of the class will result
in dismissal from the class. Repeated tardiness** will negatively affect your
participation grade. You cannot fully participate in the class if you
frequently miss part of class sessions, and you are disrupting the flow of the
class as a whole when you come in late. Therefore, even if you actively
participate in class discussions when you are in class, your participation
grade will suffer if you are chronically late. Attendance will be recorded
daily. There will be **_no make-ups_** for the collaborative discussion group
assignments or the in-class writing assignments. Make-ups for the Midterm
exams will only be considered if I am given **_advance notice_** that you will
miss the exam, and I am provided with **_acceptable written documentation_**
explaining why you missed the exam.

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:** Plagiarism or cheating of any kind will be prosecuted
according to the University's guidelines and could result in an F for the
course or dismissal from the University. Review page 36 in PSU, _2001-2003
University Catalog_ and be absolutely sure you understand and comply with
these guidelines.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Any student who has a disability that prevents the fullest
expression of abilities should contact me as soon as possible to discuss class
requirements and possible accommodations. Also see PSU, _2001-2003 University
Catalog_ , pg. 23-24. As instructor for this course, I reserve the right to
alter this syllabus if required; you will be notified in writing if this
occurs.

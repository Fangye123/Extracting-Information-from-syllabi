Marxism is the name for a complicated tradition of theoretical analysis of, as
well as movements to overthrow, capitalism. In this course our attention will
be focused on Marxian theoretical critiques of capitalist society - launched
from economic, cultural and philosophical quarters. For the sake of
organizational simplicity, I have divided the Marxist critical tradition into
two broad categories - the cultural and the economic. The latter entails an
analysis of the forms of exploitation particular to capitalism and the
dynamics of a capitalist economy and society and will take us into a careful,
though selective, reading of Marx's famous book _Capital_ , volume 1\. To
explore the more "cultural" tradition of critique we will read Marx's work on
alienation and later in the term, encounter Gramscian Marxism, perhaps the
most important source of "critical theory" of the culture of capitalism. We
will also read a new book from J.K. Gibson-Graham that draws on both the
economic and the cultural traditions to produce what the authors call a
feminist critique of political economy.  
  

This latter text is part of an emerging so-called postmodern tradition in
Marxism which takes looks carefully at the discursive aspects of capitalism.
This controversial text argues that capitalism is, among other things, a
constructed concept, and that left politics and analysis is not always well
served by the meanings of capitalism that have been popular among some
marxists and in the broader left.

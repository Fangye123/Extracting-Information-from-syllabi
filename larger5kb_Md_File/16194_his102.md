Course Description  
The history of the ancient Near East is complex.  Civilizations emerged and
disappeared.  Among these were the peoples of Egypt, Phoenicia and
Mesopotamia, who gave us innovations like writing, monumental architectural
styles and distinctive artwork. By contrast, ancient Palestine was a political
and cultural backwater in the Bronze and Iron Ages. Yet, this region produced
something that continues to shape the modern world:  a religious world view
now serving as the foundation for Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

We will trace the history of Palestine during an era when this religious world
view was beginning to emerge.  We will study social and political events, then
look at how those influences created a people called "Israel" and molded the
religion associated with that name.  


Course Objectives  
You are expected to accomplish each of the following:

**(1)**   Develop a full comprehension of chronology from earliest times to
the Roman era.

**(2)**   Develop a full comprehension of the geography of the ancient Near
East.

**(3)**   Be able to answer the following questions:  
  (a)  What is a genre?  
(b)  How is the modern genre of history writing different from the ancient
genre of history writing?

(c)  What is an ethnic group?  
(d)  How does an archeologist "find" an ethnic group in the material remains
of the ancient world?

(e)  What is the difference between a chiefdom and a kingdom?  
(f)  How did ethnic groups evolve from chiefdoms to kingdoms in ancient
Palestine?

(g)  What is a religion?  
(h)  How did the religion of Yahweh emerge in ancient Palestine?

Syllabus

**Student Requirements:**

(1)  Read assignments and attend every class session.

(2)  Pass three scheduled exams and one Final Exam.

(3)  Write one paper of five pages.



**Student Evaluation:**  
Your grade will be based on a percentage system.  The math is easy.  Add the
total number of possible points listed on the exams and the paper (but do not
include bonus quizzes).  Then add the total number of points you have earned
from the exams, the paper and the bonus quizzes.  Then do simple division  \--
Total Earned divided by Total Possible equals a number less than 1.00.  This
is your grade as a percent of points earned.  A = 91% or above.   B = 81% -
90%.  C = 71% - 80%.   D = 61% - 70%.  F = Less than 61%.

**Class Participation:**   I take attendance at most sessions.  If you show a
pattern of absence, it could lower your grade as much as one letter grade.
However, if you show a pattern of presence, your grade could rise one letter
grade.  Come to class!

**Bonus Quizzes:**   There will be about five or so unannounced bonus quizzes
during the course of the semester.  If you are absent for any reason, the quiz
cannot be made up.  Come to class!

**Exams:**   Each exam will be worth 100 points.  Keep checking this web page
for updates.  As we discuss issues in class, study guides that review class
events will appear on the Study Guide page.  The questions for bonus quizzes
and exams will be taken directly from the study guides.  Therefore, when you
take an exam or quiz, there will be no surprises (unless you fail to study
this web page).  Go to [Study
Guides](http://www.ma.psu.edu/~kxn12/his102/studyguide.html)

Note:  You MUST attend class on the scheduled exam days.  If you are absent
FOR ANY REASON without contacting me prior to the exam, then you CANNOT take a
make-up exam.  Mark the exam days on your calendar and come take the exams.
Most excuses for missing an exam are _not_ acceptable:   I am not insensitive
if a family member has died or you are very seriously ill (i.e. dead but still
walking for some reason), but if you miss the exam for any other reason, you
are out of luck.

**Paper:**   The paper will be worth 100 points and is **due the day before
Thanksgiving Break, which is Wednesday, November 21**.   You may hand the
paper in before that date, but not after.  If you miss the deadline, you will
receive a zero for the paper.  The calendar is designed to give you time to
write the paper.  You may show me a rough draft at any time during the
semester if you like.  The paper will be five to seven pages, typed (on a
typewriter or computer processor), double-spaced on regular size paper, with
one-inch margins on all four sides.  Do _not_ use a cover page and do _not_
enclose the paper in a binder of any kind.   Staple the pages in the upper
left-hand corner, and make sure that each page is numbered.

**Paper Instructions:**   The paper will be a BOOK REVIEW.  The purpose of
this assignment is to give you an opportunity to evaluate the methods by which
historians create a narrative about the past.  To that end, you will select
any _one_ book from the Book Review Choices List.  Each book is available
through the Penn State Library System's [Search
Engine](http://psulias.psu.edu:1212/;&db=psu).  If you have filled out a form
with the librarian on this campus, you can order a book from any campus by
choosing the I WANT IT icon and following the instructions.  Another way to
obtain the book is to e-mail Alica White, the librarian who handles
interlibrary loan requests (acw@psulias.psu.edu).

Read the book carefully, taking notes on each of the four topics listed here.
Write a paper that addresses all the following questions:  
  **(1)  ** What is the author's thesis?  (What is the author's central
point?)  Describe that thesis fully in about one or two paragraphs.

**(2)**   How has the author defended the thesis?  (What facts and rational
arguments has the author advanced in defense of the central point?  What was
the logical flow of thought that the author employed to defend the thesis?
How did the argument move from one point to the next?)

**(3)**   In your view, has the thesis been defended properly?  (It does not
matter whether you agree or disagree with the author's point of view.  The
issue under this heading is:  Has the author employed an approach that gives
the reader good and sufficient reason to take the central thesis seriously?
Explain why you think the author has, or has not, accomplished this.)

**(4)**   Do you agree or disagree with the author?  Defend your thesis with
facts and rational arguments.  (It does not matter whether you agree or
disagree with the author.  I will grade you on how well you defend your
position.)

**Note:  ** As part of your evaluation, you should do additional research.  A
good way to begin is to consult the bibliography in the textbook.  You should
consult some of the works cited in the book you are reviewing as well.  Also,
you can do topic or author searches on the Penn State [Search
Engine](http://psulias.psu.edu:1212/;&db=psu).  Don't be afraid to walk up the
hill and visit the library either!  (Librarians can be very helpful  \--  you
only need to ask.)  Note:  Be careful when doing web-based searches.  Not all
web pages are of equal value.  As a matter of fact, "the history of Israel" is
a topic that generates quite a bit of "crank" nonsense on the World Wide Web.
There are some good web sites listed on this page.  Include proper footnote
citations of the literature you have studied as part of this project.  For
academic-style guidelines, consult:  Turabian, Kate L., _A Manual for Writers
of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_ (Fifth edition; Chicago: The
University of Chicago Press, 1987);   for footnote citations, see pages
120-64.

**Suggestion:**   Have someone you trust proof read your paper before you turn
it in.



**Required Text:**   Noll,  _Canaan and Israel in Antiquity_   (Sheffield:
Sheffield Academic Press).  
Optional:  At times, you might find it helpful to consult a Bible.  


**Calendar:**  
This reading schedule should be followed.  Class discussion might, or might
not, keep pace with the readings, but you are responsible for all reading
assignments, regardless.  Therefore, stick to the reading schedule.  Please
note that some weeks' reading assignments are heavier than others.

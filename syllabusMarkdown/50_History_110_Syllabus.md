  _CourseDescription_  
            This survey course will examine the major developments that contributed to the formation of western civilization and its culture.  Roughly the first half of the course will focus on the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, the Hebrews, Greece, Rome, and early Christianity to approximately the end of the tenth century C.E.    The second half will examine the High and Late Middle Ages, the Renaissance and Reformation, and early modern Europe up until the contrasting political developments of absolutism of Louis XIV and Britains Glorious Revolution approximately at the end of the seventeenth century.  
                The content of the course ranges widely but overall will tend to focus on the individual, society, structures of authority, and systems of belief as well as the relations between the four.  Integral to the course is development of historical methodology including critical analysis and reading in the understanding and interpreting of historical events in their own contemporary context and not as some preplanned, prearranged, and predestined antecedent to present modernity.  As such, analysis and interpretation of texts rather than the memorization of material will be emphasized and critical to the successful completion of the course.

  
_Textbooks (All available at Illini Union, Folletts, and TIS bookstores,
except the course packet, see below)_.   The principle texts for the class
will be numbers 1-4 and numbers 5-8 will form the texts for the semester
microtheme papers.

                From this schema, it seems that one-half of the semester grade derives from lecture, the other half from discussion sections.  But this is completely WRONG.  Exams and papers are completely integrated with one another: failure to attend and prepare for lecture will entail failure in discussion and vice versa.  Discussion classes will be devoted primarily to developing the skills of historical inquiry and methodology (as stated above, memorization of material will count for little) of historical texts.  And of course, texts must be placed in context which will be the primary focus of lecture and the textbook.  Because anywhere from 25 to 40% of exams will be devoted solely to the analysis of historical texts, skills acquired in discussion and context derived from lecture and textbooks must be mastered (for importance of this see grading schemata above).  
                Course grades will follow a straight curve with the following breakdown (including +s and s):  As, 90% & above; Bs, 89-80%; Cs, 79-70%; Ds, 69-60%; and Fs, less than 59%.  
                Four microtheme papers will be due during the semester in discussion class and are listed on the syllabus.  Each paper will be approximately 750 words (about 3 pages) and will follow the format determined by your individual TA.  The papers will require the critical analysis of assigned texts focused on the particular theme/question of the assignment.  
                **Other Policies:** Late Papers, None; Make-up Papers, None; Extra-credit Work, None.  
                **Attendance** for lecture and discussion sections is mandatory.   TAs are encouraged to give quizzes and extra short papers to ensure preparation for class as well as to mark class attendance (or note lack thereof) and participation (or note the lack thereof).  
                The mid-term and final cumulative exam will be held in Foellinger Auditorium.  Note Bene: the final exam must be taken, if not, an F will be awarded for the semester grade regardless of previous performance in the semester.

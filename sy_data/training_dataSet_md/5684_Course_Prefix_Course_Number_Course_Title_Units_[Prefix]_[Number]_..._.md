CITING NON-BOOK RESOURCES

  
  
  
  

A film or video recording (cassette or disc) usually begins with the title,
underlined, and includes the director, the distributor, and the year. You may
include other data that seem pertinent - such as the names of the writer,
performers, and producer - between the title and the distributor.

  
  
  
  

_It's a Wonderful Life_. Dir. Frank Capra. Perf. James Stewart, Donna Reed,
Lionel Barrymore, and Thomas Mitchell. 1946. Videocassette. Republic, 1988.

  
  

_Medicine at the Crossroads_. Prod. 13/WNET and BBC TV. Videocassette. PBS
Video, 1993.

  
  
  
  

Audio recordings: A rough rule of thumb is that entries for popular music
begin with the performer, and classical music, with the composer. However, MLA
seems to allow entry under "desired emphasis," which could be, for example,
conductor or narrator. (Compact Disc is assumed form; others are so
stipulated.)

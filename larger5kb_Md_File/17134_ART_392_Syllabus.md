> **Prerequisite:** ART 390 Introduction to Computer Art

>

>  **_The Computer in the Visual Arts_** by Anne Morgan Spalter. (ISBN:
0201386003)  $ 48.00 new / $36.00 used plus tax at BGSU bookstore or $45.90
plus shipping (no tax) at [www.ecampus.com](http://www.ecampus.com)

>

> **Suggested Books:** Any book that covers Painter or Photoshop. _** Hold out
for Photoshop 6 guide!_  
>  **_Photoshop 5.5 For Windows and Macintosh_** by Elaine Weinmann and Peter
Lourekas (ISBN: 0201699575)  
>  $23.98 plus shipping (no tax) at [www.ecampus.com](http:// www.ecampus.com)

>

> **Course Description and Objectives:**  
>  Projects will require exploration and experimentation of integrating
digital imagery into the creative process. The objective is to consolidate
traditionally different modes of artistic expression including the lens of a
camera, the stroke of a brush, and the gesture of a hand, while studying the
aesthetic traditions that have influenced artists in their use of computers.
Students develop the skills, knowledge, and historical perspective necessary
to create their own unique body of work using the computer.

>

> This semester we will concentrate on learning to use the computer as a fine
art tool. We will be working primarily in Adobe Photoshop 6.0 and Corel
Painter 5.5, but may expand our horizons into other software as deemed
necessary by student interest. We will explore various methods of input
(scanning, digital camera, video capture, web) and output (various printing
methods, transfer paper, projection, film recorder, screen display, etc.).

>

> Students will be encouraged to find and present new ideas surrounding the
tools (techniques), formal composition, content, readings, and ideas connected
with art and computer art.

>

> **TOPICS TO BE COVERED:** _Subject to change._  
>  The primary goals of this course are to find your artistic voice and to
facilitate the process of creativity with the digital imaging medium. You will
do this while learning the following concepts:

>

>   * Image manipulation

>   * Input Techniques (see above)

>   * Output techniques (see above)

>   * Text and type basics

>   * Color separation and print quality

>   * 2D painting

>   * Misc. topics, time permitting

The focus of the course is on IDEAS, however. We will also discuss:

>   * Composition

>   * Computer art and digital imaging history and theory

>   * Your individual ideas and creativity

>

> **GRADES:** Grades will be based on attendance, participation, assignments,
research projects, and the final project. "A"s are only given for excellent
projects that are turned in on time! "C"s are given for projects completed on
time but average in quality and quantity. "F"s are substituted for missing
assignments. Cumulative grades are calculated on the computer periodically
throughout the course and distributed to the individual student.  
>  You will be graded on an equal balance of the following:

>

>   1. Class Participation (in critiques, discussions, asking questions,
making comments)

>   2. Class Preparation (do readings, bring materials)

>   3. Overall Growth (how much you matured as an artist over the semester)

>   4. Projects (5 projects of equal value)

>   5. Final Project (x2 = double value)

>   6. Attendance (lowers grade if exceed limit, see below)

>   7. Bonus point opportunities available at my discretion with pop quizzes,
hanging opportunitiesw, etc.

**LATE ASSIGNMENTS:** Up to 24 hours late is one grade lower, 1-3 days late is
two grades lower, and 3-5 days late is 3 grades lower. No late assignments
will be accepted after 5 days. You will receive an "F" for that project.

>

> **Attendance:** _Read Carefully._ You must call, email, or tell me in person
if you are going to be absent. A _legitimate,_ reported absence is considered
EXCUSED. I allow THREE (3) excused absences for this course. ANY additional
absences or unreported absences, for whatever reason, will be considered
Unexcused. UNEXCUSED absences result in ONE WHOLE LETTER GRADE REDUCTION TO
YOUR FINAL GRADE

>

> **Tardiness:** Three arrivals of more than 15 minutes late = one (1)
absence. Role will be taken at the beginning of each class. If you wander in
late, it is your responsibility to make sure I mark your arrival.

>

> **Leaving Early:** Do not leave class early. If you absolutely must, you
have to clear it with me first, or you will be considered absent for that
entire day.

>

> **Critiques:** Attendance at FINAL CRITIQUE is mandatory. Absence from that,
for any reason will lower your final grade by one letter.

>

> During Critiques, I expect each student's full attention and respect.
Computers are TURNED OFF during crits. Critiques begin promptly at class start
time. The majority of your participation grade is evaluated from critique
participation. Attendance and participation at Final Critique is mandatory.

>

> **READINGS:** We will have reading assignments from the text book and other
sources throughout the semester. These are required and pop quizzes for bonus
grade points may be administered upon completion.

>

> **DISCUSSIONS:** One objective of this course is to provide a forum for
discussion of the artwork in order to help each student develop their own
artistic concepts and ideas. Students will present these developments in group
discussions. Readings will also be discussed as a group. Participation in
these discussions by each student is mandatory.

>

> **CLASS MATERIAL:** You are accountable for material covered in class,
including handouts. IF ANYTHING IS NOT CLEAR, ASK! It is **your
responsibility** to get missed materials from me or your classmates. I will
gladly clarify any information you don't understand, but I will NOT repeat
demonstrations for absentees! _This website will be updated regularly, so
check here if you miss class_

>

> **Student Concerns:** Any student who wishes to discuss accommodations on
the basis of a disability please come talk to me after class or during office
hours.

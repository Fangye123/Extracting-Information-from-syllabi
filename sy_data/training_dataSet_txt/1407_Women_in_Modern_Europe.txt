   Women in Modern Europe      Women in Modern Europe    History 419, Spring 2002   Dr. Wiltenburg, ext. 3992     Tuesday/Thursday 9:30-10:45   Office hours: W 2-4, F 9:30-11:30, other times by         appt.        email: wiltenburg@rowan.edu     This course examines the history of women in Europe from theeighteenth century to the twentieth. As a 400-level history course,it requires a serious commitment of time and effort. All readingslisted on the syllabus are required, and students must be prepared toparticipate in class sessions. Written Requirements: Two papers plus midterm and finalessay exams. The first paper (3-5 pages) will be assigned based onthe course reading. The second paper of 8-10 pages will requireoutside research. Short writing assignments in class are not gradedindividually but form part of my assessment of participation. Classroom Requirements: Reading assignments are due by thefirst class meeting of the week unless otherwise noted (and exceptfor the first week of class). Regular attendance and participationare required and will be considered in the computation of grades.Students who miss more than one class will be required to hand in a1-page summary of the reading. Please bring books to class forconsultation and discussion. Each student will give an oralpresentation based on research for the second paper. Grades: Grades will be assigned on a scale of A, A-, B+,etc., and will be based on the two papers (20% and 25%), midterm(20%) final exam (20%), and class participation (15%).

**CLASS OBJECTIVES**

This course surveys the history of the United States from the period of first
contact with Native Americans to the end of the Civil War. These years
comprise more than two-thirds of the total history of a land that was
radically transformed by the large number of immigrants from all points on the
globe. This complex and fascinating era saw the establishment of a uniquely
"American" culture that included self-government, constitutional rule (or the
rule by written laws), religious toleration, a healthy and expanding
capitalist economy, racial slavery, and a fundamental disregard for the
territorial rights of Spain, Mexico, Canada, France, England, and especially
Native Americans. Needless to say, these and other issues discussed in this
class are integral to an understanding of this nation's past, present, and
future. This course takes these consequential events seriously; asking where
and how Americans defined concepts of justice, freedom, and opportunity,
whether or not they were met, and how major social movements both reflected
and forced changes on the American people.  
  
Our mission as a class is to become familiar with the key concepts and events
in American history, to foster informed in-class discussions of these concepts
and events, and to emerge at the end of the quarter with a heightened
awareness of, and empathy for the people who created this country. The basic
tools that we will use to meet these objectives are formal lectures, class
discussions, group projects, outside reading, slide and video presentations,
humor, and most importantly our intellectual curiosity. While the class is not
intended as a civics lesson, it will stress the fact that deciphering the
_meaning of history_ is an ongoing intellectual process -- one that will
continue with or without your active participation. The class can act as a
starting point for your role in this debate.  
  
As a result of these efforts, this class will be working to build what Briar
Cliff College calls our  "historical foundation." As defined by the College,
"the Historical Foundation promotes a habit of mind which examines 'events'
within historical context, both as a way of discerning truth as well as
appreciating the development and continuity of the human community."

**DESCRIPTION OF GRADED EVENTS**  
  

**Exams (60%)** will each be divided into three sections. The first asks you
to identify the significance of several key terms and is worth 40% of the
exam. The second asks for one short answer to a question and is worth 30% of
the exam. The third asks for a well-argued essay answer and is worth 30% of
the exam. The Final Exam will **not be** comprehensive. Handouts will be made
available listing probable ID terms for each exam. A brief, in-class review of
the format for the first exam is possible if needed. See the history
department web-page for more  "useful information."  
  

**The In-Class Presentation (15%)** will be a 5-10 minute, in-class
presentation by teams of 3-5 students on historical topics and in formats
_defined by the groups_. A handout describing the parameters of this
assignment and a posting of the assigned teams will be made available by the
third week of class. Attendance will be taken and is mandatory for all
presentation days. Individual students will have their own grade dropped 5%
for failing to attend **either** class period.  
  

**Rorabaugh Paper (15%)** is a four- to six-page analytical review of a
secondary work in history. A style sheet will be distributed to provide
additional information on this assignment.  
  

**Class Participation and in-class projects (10%)** will deal with the
material presented throughout the term. These are periodic, unscheduled, and
can not be made up if you miss class. Class participation is a subjective
grade based on your attendance and conduct as a mature student in class.  
  

**ACADEMIC DISHONESTY, ATTENDANCE, AND OTHER CLASS POLICIES**

It is my experience and belief that most students attend class regularly,
submit assignments and take exams on time, perform well over the quarter, and
do not cheat. Moreover, I am flexible with students who prove willing to work
to overcome early-quarter "lapses" in attendance, performance, or honesty.
Unfortunately, the following rules are necessary for those unable or unwilling
to meet the basic requirements of College life.  
  

The penalty for academic dishonesty is specified in the current Undergraduate
Bulletin. In short, students will be awarded zero points for any assignment in
which cheating is detected. Moreover, the student's academic advisor will be
informed of any instances of cheating.  
  

Regular attendance is vital to all College course work. Your final grade will
be lowered by a full letter grade if you miss more than **three** classes, for
any reason, over the course of the quarter. If you miss **five** or more
classes, I will expect you to drop the class or accept a failing grade for the
course.  
  

Students who fail the first exam are required to schedule a meeting with me
within one week of the return of the exam to discuss their work and ways to
improve their performance.  
  

Make-up exams will be offered to students who call me before test time and
later provide a **written notice** of an excused absence. The questions on the
make-up exam will not be harder, per se, but the exam will not offer optional
questions (e.g., on a scheduled exam the student will be asked to answer one
of two essay questions, on a make-up exam there will be only one question).
Make-up exams will be offered for only one week after the scheduled date of
the exam, after which the student will earn a score of zero for that
assignment. A student may only take one make-up exam over the span of the
quarter.  
  

See me immediately if the material, course description, or assignments are
confusing in any way. In addition, see me immediately if you have any special
physical needs or need any unique arrangements in order to attend and
successfully complete the course.  
  

**FINAL THOUGHTS AND MISCELLANEOUS "RAH-RAH"**  
  

Throw out your previous bad experiences with History in High School or at
other Colleges. This course does not require that you memorize speeches,
dates, or statistics that (as College students) your are intelligent enough to
look up in any textbook. The focus in this course is on finding the
_significance_ of people, events, and ideas. While those habitually  "bored"
with history may be able to convince themselves that this class is no
different than others, we will be approaching the past in ways that constantly
require our conscious (re)consideration.  
  

History as a discipline requires no special knowledge, has little or no
technical jargon, and ultimately is the study of what makes people do what
they do. There is nothing in this class (or other history classes) that is too
difficult to comprehend if you are willing to **read the assignments, attend
class, take notes, and use your God-given intellect**.  
  

It is my job to present the material as clearly and as engaging as possible.
It is my job to be available to you to help you to experience the intellectual
exhilaration of the "historical foundation." In sum, I am here to help you
with a subject that I love to talk about! While I can't guarantee that every
student will find equal joy in the academic challenge of the course, I can
promise that I will bring my excitement and the best of my abilities to class
every day.  
  

**CLASS SCHEDULE**  
  

Please note that topics may change from day to day depending on the pace of
class discussion. You can be extremely confident, however, that I will _not_
change dates for the exams.

**Final Exam (30%) TBA**

Discussion questions and Style Sheet for W.J. Rorabaugh, _The Alcoholic
Republic: An American Tradition_ (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 1979).  
  

You are to write a paper of no more than six pages, no less than four, that
clearly relates a key theme or component of the text. Your final draft should
be free of grammatical and spelling errors, double-spaced, and use
"reasonable" fonts and margins. **This is not a book review. Do not spend time
and effort telling me what you and I have already read. Do not write a "paper"
that simply responds to the questions below**. Rather, you should focus your
energies in trying to link the author's treatment of alcohol consumption
around common themes (suggested below) or ideas of your own choosing.  
  

The paper is worth 15% of your total class grade. It is due at the start of
class on **_October 11_**. The grade will be dropped by one full letter (A to
B, B- to C-, etc.) for each class day that the assignment is late. Late papers
will be graded with the knowledge that the class has already discussed many of
the book's key themes and ideas.  
  

The following questions may be useful in formulating your paper's thesis. We
will discuss each question in class.  
  

1\. Rorabaugh argues that alcoholic consumption reflects some important trends
and developments during the colonial and early republic periods. What specific
examples does he employ to illustrate the importance of alcohol?  
  

2\. What kinds of sources does he use to support his thesis? Is this evidence
convincing or persuasive?  
  

3\. Recent medical research claims that alcoholism is a _disease_. How does
this affect Rorabaugh's argument? Does it weaken or strengthen his thesis?  
  

4\. Why was temperance such a controversial issue? What groups supported
temperance and why?  
  

5\. How were drinking and temperance related to different ideas about freedom
and liberty in the early republic? Did drinkers have a different conception of
liberty than the supporters of temperance? Why? Did these conceptions of
liberty and freedom have any political importance?  
  

6\. What was the potential threat of the Whiskey Rebellion? Why did the
federal government act so decisively in this case?  
  

Based on my experience grading other such papers, I suggest that you first try
to think through the implications of these questions then formulate a theme
that _you think_ connects the various examples. Only after thinking through
your argument should you try to outline and write your essay. As I stated in
class, this is an exercise to elicit _your educated opinion_ (supported by
examples) about historical change.  
  

**In-Class Presentation**

This assignment calls for an in-class presentation by groups of students. The
following are the only "rules" governing the content of the presentations:

(1) The presentation must examine an actual event, person, controversy, or
trend in American history occurring sometime between the pre-Contact era until
the conclusion of the Civil War (1865). I suggest that you use the text, _Out
of Many_ (from chapter 1 to 16), and/or lectures for help in finding a
suitable topic. See me if you are concerned that your topic is not appropriate
for presentation but you are on your own in selecting it.  
  

(2) At some point the presentation must _expressly relate the historical
significance_ of the topic. The group must make clear to the audience why the
topic is important to U.S. history. You can do this explicitly or, better yet,
work it into the text of your presentation.  
  

(3) Every member of the group _must participate_ in the presentation.  
  

(4) The presentation should run about 10-15 minutes (certainly no longer). The
format is almost wholly dependent on your imagination and creativity. If you
want to do a "SportsCenter" broadcast of the Mexican-American War... fine. If
you want to do a Regis and Kathy Lee account of republicanism... fine. If you
want to lampoon your instructor... fine. A boxing match between Lincoln and
Douglas, Puritans doing hip-hop, Jefferson in outer space; all are fine as
long as you meet the basic criteria of the assignment.

**NOTE: Due to popular demand and the excruciatingly boring format, the ever-
popular, last-minute, talk show format has been forever banned.** While the
"breaking newscast" format ("We now go live to Jessica at Independence
Hall...") is old and tired, it has not yet been officially banished (maybe
your group can be the one to send it to its doom).  
  

(5) In order to receive a grade, each group must perform in class and provide
to me the following:

(a) a one-page sheet describing the group topic and the specific activities of
each member of the group, due in-class on **Wednesday, October 4.**

(b) a one-page summary of your presentation, its historical significance, and
a brief statement of what you learned through the your efforts. This is **due
on the day of your presentation**. Please have every member of the team
**sign** the document before handing it in (a grade will not be provided until
I have a signed copy).  
  

(6) Every member will receive the same grade. Because of the subjective nature
of assignment I will be asking non-performing members of the audience to
anonymously grade each group. I will use these tallies to help me in
determining the final grades.  
  

Suggestions based on experience:

(1) Involve everyone in the initial discussion of potential presentation
topics and be sensitive to other's ideas and objections.  
  

(2) Technology, in the form of video or audiotapes, slides, and the Internet
is notoriously fickle, be sure to plan for backup if these fail. Do not use
long clips from videotapes (anything longer than a minute will detract from
your presentation). Props, costumes, etc. will add to the appeal of your
production. It may also add to its complexity. Be reasonable in your
expectations and be sure to see me if you need assistance in obtaining
materials (NOTE: props are not _required_ )  
  

(3) You should plan to practice your presentation together at least once
before coming to class. I've been doing this assignment for years and it is
clear who has prepared and who hasn't -- this will be reflected in your grade.  
  

Both the group and I will track each member's general performance and support
for the assignment. If problems persist and if attempts at polite persuasion
fail to bring recalcitrant members back into the fold, I reserve the right to
remove individuals from the group. If this does occur the **** student will
earn a zero on the assignment. It is _my_ responsibility to assign this grade
but it is _your_ responsibility to make me aware that a problem exists. There
is no make-up procedure for students who fail to attend class on the assigned
date.  
  

The grade will be based on the following formula:  
  

25 points Is the topic significant to U.S. history and does the group
demonstrate this effectively (don't just tell us it is so, describe why). Is
the topic focused enough so that a group can present their subject in the
limited time available (don't do "The Civil War," for example)?  
  

25 points Does the group provide appropriate background and descriptive
material to make the subject meaningful to the audience? Is there too much of
this and not enough discussion of meaning?  
  

25 points How does the group work together? Is this four or five separate
presentations ("Now Sally will discuss...") or are they merged into one? This
is an area where many groups lose points.  
  

25 points How is the presentation? Is it engaging, practiced, stays on target?
Or are the members un-enthused, simply going through the motions, and
basically telling us that they don't give a damn? Do you use technology,
props, costumes, humor, or otherwise try to be a little risky? [FYI, I've been
known to be biased in support of groups that try new things. I'd rather see a
group attempt something difficult and have some problems in presentation than
see another flawless panel discussion between Hamilton, Burr, and Jefferson]

II. **COURSE DESCRIPTION**

> Computer Graphics I is the first part of a two-semester course sequence that
provides a basic introduction to the creation and manipulation of graphics
using the Java programming language. We begin with user interfaces and basic
drawing functions using the Java Abstract Windowing Toolkit package. We
proceed to a study of the representations of color on the computer. Then the
GIF, JPEG, and Bitmap image formats are introduced. After developing the
internal representation of an image, we consider various techniques for
manipulating images. Examples of these techniques are histogram
transformations and image filters. We then study the tools of the graphic
artist. We study these tools and techniques using GIMP, the Photoshop style
graphics package for UNIX.

###### IV. **BEHAVIORAL OBJECTIVES**



The proposed instructional objectives are as follows:

The objectives and competencies proposed for this course will be demonstrated
as students perform the following activities:

> **Using the Java Abstract Windowing Toolkit to develop the user interfaces
required in modern graphics programs.**

>

> **Demonstration of a practical knowledge of color representation on modern
computers.**

>

> **Demonstration of a practical knowledge of image formats in modern computer
programming.**

>

> **Demonstration of an ability to convert images to an internal
representation and manipulate them.**

>

> **Creation and employment of a variety of image manipulation algorithms.**

>

> **Mastery of the tools and techniques used in working with a graphics
package.**

V. **EVALUATION CRITERIA/GRADING SCALE**

> There will be ten assignments, two tests and a comprehensive final exam. The
grading scale for determining the course grade, the weights assigned to
assignments and the final examination are given below. The assignments, the
tests and the final exam will be graded on a 100 point scale. The average for
the assignments is computed and then weighted as 10% of the final grade. Each
test and the final exam is weighted as 30% and all are averaged with the given
weights. The average will be computed as in the example below.

**Example:**

> To see how your grade will be calculated, suppose your assignment scores are
85, 95, 85, 100, 80, 95, 80, 90, 100 and 90, your first test score is a 80,
the second is an 100 and the final exam score is 90. Since the lowest test
grade is dropped (see item 1 under COURSE REQUIREMENTS), your grade would be
calculated as follows:

>

> 0.10 * [.10* (85 + 95 + 85 + 100 + 80 + 95 + 80 + 90 + 100 + 90) ] + 0.30 *
80 + 0.30 *100 + 0.30 *80 = 90

>

> Since 90 is between 83 and 92 you would receive a grade of B.

**Weights Assigned to graded materials:**

Assignments | 1% Each  
---|---  
Tests | 30%  
Comprehensive Final Examination | 30%  
  
**Grading Scale:**

**A** |  92-100% | Assignments 10%  
---|---|---  
**B** |  83-91% | Tests 30%  
**C** |  73-82% | Final Exam 30%  
**D** |  64-72% |  
**F** |  Below 63% |  
  


VI. **READING ASSIGNMENTS:**

> **Read each section prior to the presentation of the topic in class.**

>  

VII. **COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

> Conduct of Course/Classroom Decorum

**1.** |  Students are responsible for availing themselves of _**all**_ class
meetings and individual help from the instructor.  
---|---  
  |  
**2.** |  Students are responsible for maintaining a notebook of problems
selected by the instructor. Students are encouraged to include as many
additional problems as is possible  
  |  
**3.** |  All tests will be announced prior to their administration. Since the
lowest test will be dropped no make-up test will be given. There will be a
test given at the end of each chapter, except possibly for chapter 6, and
there will be a comprehensive final examination given.  
  |  
**4.** |  Students are expected to enter the classroom on time and remain
until the class ends. Late arrivals and early departures will be noted in the
record book. The class attendance policy set forth in the 1996-1998 FSU
Catalogue will be strictly adhered to.  
  |  
**5.** |  Students must refrain from smoking, eating, and drinking in the
classroom. The rights of others must be respected at all times.  
  |  
**6.** |  Students are encouraged to ask questions of the instructor in class
and to respond to those posed by the instructor. They should not discourage
others from asking or answering questions. Other students often have the same
questions on their minds, but are hesitant to ask.  
  |  
**7.** |  Students are expected to complete all class assignments and to spend
adequate time on their class work and to read each topic prior to class
discussion to insure that the course objectives are met. Two hours of home
study is expected for each hour of class.  
  |  
**8.** |  Talking in class between students is strictly unacceptable.
Discussions should be directed to the instructor.  
  |  
**9.** |  Extra recitation periods and/or computer lab attendance are
mandatory for students whose grades fall below **C**. They must meet the
instructor to arrange for extra activities.  
  |  
**10.** |  Dishonesty on graded assignments will not be tolerated. Students
must neither give nor receive help on any work to be graded. The University
policy on cheating will be applied to any violations. The **_minimum_**
penalty will be a grade of _ **zero**_ on the assignment.

**The Project**

> Development of a significant, high-quality interactive multimedia project by
groups of two **collaborating** students. Project will be taken from
conception to publication on CD ROM, including research of topic, addressing
issues of navigation, interactivity, user interface design, screen design,
typography, mixing of media (sound, animation, stills, video), effective
visual presentation of information.

>

> **Team collaboration mirrors the process of multimedia production in the
industry.**

>

> The project will be started early in the semester. Materials necessary for
the planning process will be introduced early on. However, you will need to
begin working on your project BEFORE we complete all the tutorials, applying
new information/skills along the way.

>

> You will be presenting your project in class and at the Ruhlman Conference.

>

> ### This class and the project development demands **a lot** of time.  
>  **Please** do not take more than four courses this semester  
>  
> ---  
  
**  
List of Materials that you will need**

> **Storage** for your files: **Two Zip cartridges** \- one for your work; one
for a complete backup. You can buy them from the bookstore.  Tip: Use the
backup zip ONLY for backing up. That will lessen the wear and tear on that zip
and minimize potential disk problems.

>

> **Backup your files regularly** \- the last thing you want to happen is to
lose your work!

**  
Course Requirements:**

> **Attendance** \- an absolute must. There will be a steady supply of
tutorials, demonstrations and workshops that you must be there to see and
experience. Your participation in **class critiques** is essential. 10% of
your grade will be based on class participation.  Excessive absences will be
reflected in your grade!

>

> **Homework:**  
>  [Readings](07-readingspt1.html)  
>  Short reviews of CD-ROMs and web sites  
>  Skill-specific homework  assignments (weekly)  
>

>

> **Semester-long project** : Collaborative project to be put on CD-ROM

>

> There will be **no exams** for this course.

>

> **Grading:**  
>  10% class participation  
>  30% homework  
>  60% project

>

> **Criteria for grading projects and homework:**  
>  functionality  
>  design  
>  creativity/originality  
>  effective use of the media  
>  efficiency of your project  
>  sense of humor -  just kidding

**Warning:**

This class will require **a lot of time**. Plan to allocate time for learning
the software, and for experimenting before you're ready to do the homework.
The first law of programming applies:

> **If** you estimate that it takes x hours to finish the homework,

>

> **then** the actual required time is 2x + 10.

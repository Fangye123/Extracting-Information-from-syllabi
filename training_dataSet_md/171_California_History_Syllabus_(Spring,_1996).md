         This course will explore the history of California from
    prehistoric times to the present.  Themes to be developed include
    the remarkable diversity of aboriginal cultures, the militant
    ministry of Spanish missionaries, Californio society during the
    Mexican period, the arrival of Anglo-Americans and the "Bear Flag
    Revolt," the discovery of gold and the subsequent mass
    immigration of Americans, the development of agriculture,
    industry, and, by the twentieth century, a distinctive regional
    culture.  California's role as arbiter of the larger national
    culture will be examined as well, as will the origins of the
    state's current cultural diversity and the problems that come
    with it.  
    
         The course has been designed to meet State of California
    single- and multiple-subject credential requirements for both
    elementary and secondary education.
    
    
    
    
    #### Course Materials
    
    
    
         The following books are available at the SOU bookstore:
    
         Theodora Kroeber, _Ishi in Two Worlds_
    
         Kevin Starr, _Americans and the California Dream_
    
         Leonard Pitt, _California Controversies_
    
         Since lectures will usually deal with subjects not covered
    by assigned readings, both attendance and attentiveness at course
    lectures is essential.  
    
         In addition to assigned readings and lectures, there are
    valuable reference works you should be aware of.  See the
    document, "California Reference Materials in the SOU Library,"
    on the California History Web page.  The Web page also contains
    many "links" to resources available by WWW outside the campus.
    
    
    
    
    #### Course Method
    
    
    
         California History is a combination lecture, reading, and
    discussion course.  The reading for the course will begin with
    Kroeber's book an aboriginal Californian.  Both the Starr and the
    Pitt books are topical in nature and various chapters have been
    assigned to fit as closely as possible with lecture topics.  
    
         Discussions will take place in two ways: the first in the
    traditional class setting, and the second by using the campus
    computer USENET "Newsgroups" system.  The campus news group for
    this course is: SOU.hst399.  News groups work like an electronic
    bulletin board: messages on the topic at hand are posted and read
    by all.  Responses to postings should follow as naturally as in
    conversation (except they should be prepared with a bit more
    care).  All students will be required to participate in the
    computer discussions.
    
         Additional instruction on and explanation of this method
    will be made in class.  But if you are not already familiar with
    either the WWW or the news group systems, see the instructor. 
    Both the "Web" and USENET are extremely common features of the
    larger Internet and are becoming routine in the work place.  You
    will need to be familiar with them before you graduate.   
    
    
    
    
    #### Examinations
    
    
    
         There will be a take-home midterm examination, and an in-
    class final examination.  Both will be in essay form.  The final
    exam will deal with themes developed throughout the course of the
    term.  
         
    
    
    
    #### Grading
    
    
    
         The following is a breakdown of your course grade:
    
                   Midterm examination        1/3
                   Final examination          1/3
                   Discussions (both kinds)   1/3
    
    Please keep in mind the meaning of letter grades as indicated in
    the Winter and Spring Term Class Schedule (p.14-15):
    
         A = Exceptional accomplishment 
         B = Superior
         C = Average
         D = Inferior
         F = Failed 
    
    Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading. 
    Please understand that high grades are earned, not given.  You
    build your grade from the bottom up rather than being "marked-
    off" from the top down.  Your "usual" grades in other courses
    have no bearing on your grades in this course. 
    
    
    
    
    #### Office Hours
    
    
    
    Office hour times are listed at the top of the
    first page of this syllabus.  If you cannot meet during posted
    times, see the instructor for an appointment.  Please note: In
    order to avoid interrupting students who come during office
    hours, the professor will not receive phone calls during those
    times.  You can leave a message at any time by phoning and
    waiting for the voice mail system to activate.  E-mail is the
    best method for contacting the professor.

> May 25 - June 1, 1787 (Dates refer to Madison's Notes for the dates
indicated and contained in the Farrand edition.)

>

> The Court has frequently addressed the following issues.  When reading
Madison's notes on the proceedings in Independence Hall please think about and
be prepared to discuss them.

Democratic Government: Which delegates believe in democracy?  Does it matter?
Suppose democratic sentiments were expressed for purely tactical reasons.
Would that make the document aristocratic or would it evidence the shared
assumptions of a democratic culture?

The Public Interest: Whose interests are they trying to promote?  The
"general" interest?  A specific socioeconomic group?  A geographic area?
Specific institutions?

Federalism: What is the purpose of their efforts with respect to the division
of powers among the states and national government?  fairness among the
states?  efficient government? protection for existing arrangements? support
for ratification?  sectional concerns?

Separation of Powers: What is the purpose of their efforts with respect to the
separation of powers among the branches of the federal government?  Efficiency
and/or restraint?  To the extent that the delegates are trying to restrain one
of the branches or its members, whom are the delegates trying to restrain?
Are there regional differences on this issue?

| [![Register Now!](../images/registernow.gif)](../registration.htm)  
---|---  
  
**Course Description **

Students will study past and current theories and approaches from a variety of
traditions in holistic education, as well as current trends. The focus of the
course is on "sacred learning" and how various educators and theorists have
attempted to educate in sacred ways. Students will learn about the historical
roots and evolution of the holistic education movement - which is connected to
sacred learning. Each educational tradition has different emphases - and the
underlying current of sacred learning can be found in them all. The purpose of
this course is to help students distinguish the main tenets of these different
stances and to identify how they converge on the sacred.

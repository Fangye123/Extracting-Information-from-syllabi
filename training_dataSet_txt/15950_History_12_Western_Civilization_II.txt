Kishlansky, et. al. Civilization in the West (HarperCollins), 2nd ed., vol. 2Wiesner, Ruff and Wheeler, Discovering the Western Past, 3rd. ed. (Houghton Mifflin),  vol. 2William Hughes, ed., Annual Editions:  Western Civilization (Dushkin/Brown), vol. 2  Historical Atlas of the World, 9th ed. (Hammond)  Course Requirements and Grading: Requirements for the course consist of three tests and a final exam.  All questions will be drawn from your lecture notes and readings.  The tests and the exam will contain map identifications and essay questions.  The tests will not be cumulative.  The final, however, will cover all the material from the second half of the semester. Students who miss a test because of an excused absence should make an appointment with the instructor for a make-up exam.  Students who miss a test because of an unexcused absence will get an F for that exam.  Absences are excused for any illness or injury, for participation in any university-sponsored event, and for a death or serious illness in the family.  Absences are not excused for weddings, family excursions, and carelessly-scheduled travel itineraries.  A note, signed by a nurse, physician, R.A., or other University official, is necessary to excuse an absense.  Ten percent of your grade will be based on both attendance and class participation.  I will assign the following grades for attendance:  0-1 unexcused absenses = A;  2-3 unexcused absenses = B;  4-5 unexcused absenses = C;  6-8 unexcused absenses = D;  8 or more unexcused absenses = F. Your final grade in the course will be based on the following: Three tests, each worth 20 %.............................................60 %Final exam ..................................................................30 %Attendance/Class participation.............................................10 %----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------TOTAL ......................................................................100 % Schedule of Weekly Topics:  Week 1: Jan. 30:  INTRODUCTION Week 2: Feb. 4:  THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTIONFeb. 6:  *READING:  "The Mind of An Age:  Science and Religion confront Eighteenth-Century Natural Disaster."Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 17, pp. 514-526;  chap. 19, pp. 576-586*Wiesner, chapter 3Hughes, unit 2, articles 7 - 9 Week 3: Feb. 11:  THE ATLANTIC ECONOMY  (1652-1763)Feb. 13:  *READING:  Compare Thomas Mun's "England's Treasure by Foreign Trade" with Adam Smith's The Wealth of Nations (xerox)Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 17, pp. 526-544;  chap. 18, pp. 548-553Xerox handoutHughes, unit 1, articles 1 - 4  Week 4: Feb. 18:  FIRST TESTFeb. 20:  THE FRENCH REVOLUTION  (1789-1799)Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 19, pp. 586-606 Week 5: Feb. 25:  THE NAPOLEONIC WARSFeb. 27:  *READING:  "The Liberator-Hero and Western Revolutions"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 20*Wiesner, chap. 5Hughes, unit 2, articles 11 - 14 Week 6: Mar. 4:  THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTIONMar. 6:  *READING:  "Labor Old and New:  The Impact of the Industrial Revolution"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 21*Wiesner, chap. 6Hughes, unit 3, article 15 Week 7: Mar. 11:  SECOND TESTMar. 13:  CONSUMER CULTURE IN 19TH CENTURY EUROPEReadings:Kishlansky, chap. 22 (pp. 688-694) & chap. 23 (pp. 740-44)Hughes, unit 3, articles 20 & 21 Week 8: Mar. 18:  THE NEW IDEOLOGIES Mar. 20:  *READING:  "Two Programs for Social and Political Change:  Liberalism and Socialism"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 22 (pp. 694-end); chap. 23 (pp. 730-739; 745-end) & 24 (pp.  762-78)*Wiesner, chap. 7Hughes, unit 3, article 16 Week 9: Mar. 25:  Easter holiday Mar. 27:  Easter holiday  Week 10: Apr. 1:  THE NEW IMPERIALISMApr. 3:  *READING:  Expansion and Public Opinion:  Advocates of the 'New Imperialism'"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 23 (pp. 719-729) & chap. 25*Wiesner, chap. 9Hughes, unit 3, article 18 Week 11: Apr. 8:  WORLD WAR IApr. 10:  *READING:  "World War I:  Total War"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 26*Wiesner, chap. 11Hughes, unit 4, articles 23 & 24 Week 12: Apr. 15:  THIRD TESTApr. 19:  THE RUSSIAN REVOLUTIONReadings:Kishlansky, chap. 27 Week 13: Apr. 22:  THE SEARCH FOR STABILITYApr. 24:  *READING:  "Feminism and the Peace Movement, 1910-1990"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 27*Wiesner, chap. 12 Week 14: Apr. 29:  WORLD WAR IIMay 1:  *READING:  "Selling a Totalitarian System"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 28*Wiesner, chap. 13Hughes, unit 4, articles 25, 26, & 27 Week 15: May 6:  POST-WAR EUROPEMay 10:  *READING:  "The Perils of Prosperity:  The Unrest of Youth in the 1960s"Readings:Kishlansky, chap. 29*Wiesner, chap. 14Hughes, unit 4, article 28, 30 & 32 Week 16: FINAL EXAM SCHEDULE:  Section 2:  Tues., May 20 from 2 - 4 p.m.  Section 3:  Thurs., May 15 from 11 a.m. - 1p.m.  Return to History Home Page

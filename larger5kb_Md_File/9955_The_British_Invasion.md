> It was a first lesson  in the British tradition: WHAT WAS, IS. \--Julia
Davis The Embassy Girls

####  Course Description:

Great Britain is more diverse than one might expect. Many interesting regional
differences find their origins in the uneven settlement of the British Isles
by foreign conquerors. Wave after wave of invaders and immigrants have
transformed the cultures, institutions, and languages they found on the
British Isles. This course examines the impact of early invaders (e.g. Romans,
Saxons, Vikings, and Normans) on the formation of Great Britain. Similarly,
the course will assess the influence of more recent immigrants from the West
Indies, Africa and Asia. The invaders and immigrants have not only shaped
subcultures, but have influenced the mainstream of British culture.

Because there will be unforeseen exigencies and opportunities, students should
be prepared for changes in the course.  In this sense, this syllabus is less a
contract than a covenant.  Changes in the course may be required by
circumstances or serendipity.  Ultimately, however, students bear chief
responsibility for meeting their educational goals.  The instructor's job is
to facilitate, not force, intellectual development.

####  Required Readings:

Jeremy Black 1997 _A History of the British Isles_ New York: St. Martin's  
and

####  Course objectives:

  1. To investigate the influence of cultural contact on political regimes.

  2. Prepare a short presentation to the class on a topic assigned by the instructor or lead a class discussion.
  3. Plan and direct an ethnic experience with a team assigned by the instructor.
  4. Produce a research and writing project relevant to your chosen discipline.

greater than 90%= A- | greater than 93.3%= A |  
**Exams:** The midterm and the final exam will cover all material covered in
the lectures, readings and discussion.

**Research project:** Students will write a research paper on topics chosen in
consultation with the instructor. The paper will be 8-10 double-spaced typed
pages long. Papers are evaluated on grammar, style, spelling, diction,
punctuation, and content. Students will submit two copies of their papers.

The topic of research projects vary by discipline but are negotiable. Examples
follow.

History:

  * Trace some element of the construction or destruction of empire over time.
  * Trace the historical development and political impact of a social movement in the British political system.

Political Science:

  * Critically evaluate the Samson thesis, identifying the implications of New Labor policies. ( _The Essential Anatomy of Britain._ Sampson, Anthony, 1993, ISBN: 0156290588, Harcourt Brace  & Company.)
  * Trace the historical development and political impact of a social movement in the British political system.
  * Read Lijphart's _Democracies_ and write an essay comparing and contrasting Presidential and Parliamentary systems.

Geography:   Urban Geography Group:  Read Hugh J. Gayler's 1996 book
_Geographical Excursions in London,_ ISBN: 0-7618-0328-9 and the handout
provided by the professor.  As a group, take the two East End excursions and
one other as lab exercises.  For each excursion produce an annotated map, make
sketches and photographs to document your observations.  Individually provide
a two-page write up of the lab exercise paying special attention to spatial
and ethnic concerns.  After completing the three labs, draft a four page
synthetic review highlighting the common themes of the labs.

Journalism: By contract only.  
English:

  * Linguistics: using one of these volumes of linguistic history (see below) comment on the relationship between linguistic and historical developments. ( _The English Language_. Barber, Charles, 1993, ISBN: 0521426227, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press; _A Biography of the English Language_. Millward, C. M., 1996, ISBN: 0155016474, Harcourt Brace College Publishers; _A Cultural History of the English Language_. Knowles, Gerry, 1997, ISBN: 0340676809, Oxford University Press, Incorporated.) An alternative to the research paper format would be to write five short essays during the course of the term, highlighting the era under discussion.
  * Write a series of interpretive essays or a review essay addressing five or more of these texts (or excerpts): _Tain Bo Cuailnge (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Beowulf_ , Venerable Bede's _Ecclesiastical History of English People_ , The Arthurian Legends, Medieval Romances, Chaucer's _Canterbury Tales, Robin Hood_.
  * Write a review essay covering three or more novels by authors from former British colonies.

 All work must be submitted before taking the final examination.

**Group Presentation:   **On class day trip days or at other times designated
by the instructor, teams of students will organize ethnic field trips for the
the rest of the class.  Students will need to make presentations or lead
discussion concerning the significance of planned experiences, artifacts,
places, etc.  All team members should be equally involved and integrated in
the experience, although students need not be "on" the entire time.  For
example, students may organize a meal, cultural experience, or exhibit and
only make introductory remarks before the experience and then lead a
discussion following -- leaving class members to tour, eat, etc. at their own
pace.

**Class Presentation:**   Students may negotiate with the instructor for a
particular day,
[topic](http://www.samford.edu/schools/artsci/history/faculty/rchorn/london/present.html),
or method for their presentation, but will be responsible for a class period.
While students may choose to lead discussion of required readings, some
additional preparation is expected (i.e. required) of presenters.

**Journal:**   The journal will contain two essential elements.  The first is
a record of class related ruminations reflecting student's analysis of
cultural experiences.  The second is an annotated collection of artifacts
(pictures, programs, clippings) reflecting course themes.

**Class Participation:**   Students are considered equal owners of the course.
Students should not expect to be passive recipients of a body of knowledge to
be regurgitated on exams.  Instead, students and the instructor will bring
their shared and unique experiences and interpretations of required and other
experiences and readings to our workshop on cultural contact.

instructor.  In case of absence the student contacts the instructor so that
adjusted due dates can be agreed upon. . Final grade will be computed by

converted to a letter grade following the grading scale of the college.

**Notes:**  
It is the student's responsibility to inform the instructor if they have a
handicapping condition, which requires reasonable academic adjustments. These
adjustments are defined as modifications/adaptations, which will afford them
equal opportunity to achieve equal results as those without a handicap.

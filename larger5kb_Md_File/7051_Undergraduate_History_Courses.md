### Undergraduate Courses in United States History

_Fall Semester, 2001_

**IN ORDER TO REGISTER FOR A HISTORY SEMINAR (401 OR 402), YOU MUST COME TO
RANDALL HALL 102 AND PARTICIPATE IN THE LOTTERY HELD APRIL 2-3, 2001.**

**HIUS 100, SCT. A INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Byron Hulsey

"Religion and America's Public Life Since World War II"

This reading seminar, which fulfills the second writing requirement, is
primarily an examination of religious change, continuity, and conflict in this
nation's public life since World War II. In particular, we will explore how
different groups of Americans have used their religious faiths to justify
contested beliefs and actions as they have confronted the momentous events and
issues that have shaped modern American culture. We will devote particular
attention to the Cold War, civil rights, Vietnam, the rise of the religious
right, and the religious and political dilemmas Americans face in contemporary
culture.

Students will read approximately 200 pages per week for eight weeks, write
five essays of five pages each for five weeks, and participate actively in
class discussions during each of the fourteen sessions. The essays will
comprise 75% of the final course grade, with the remaining 25% being devoted
to class participation. There will be no mid-term or final examination.

Readings will include:

Stephen J. Whitefield, The Culture of the Cold War

Robert S. Ellwood, 1950: Crossroads of American Religious Life

Charles Marsh, God's Long Summer

Adam Fairclough, Martin Luther King, Jr.

James Carroll, An American Requiem

  

**HIUS 201 AMERICAN HISTORY, 1600-1865**

Mr. Joseph F. Kett

This introductory survey course is designed both for prospective majors and
non-majors. It will trace the relationships between social, economic, and
religious change and the development of American political institutions. There
will be two 75-minute lectures and a mandatory discussion section each week.
The primary text for the course is Boyer, et al., The Enduring Vision, volume
I. In addition, there will be supplementary readings from primary sources
(sources written by figures in the past that describe their experiences or
views).

Readings will average 100 pages a week.

In addition to a final exam, the course will require either two hourly exams
or one hourly and three brief (3-5 page) papers.

  

**HIUS 206/ECON 206 AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY**

Mr. Mark Thomas

This course concentrates on critical aspects of the history of American
economic development. The issues covered include the nature and consequences
of the colonial relationship to Great Britain, the political economy of the
Constitution, the economics of slavery, the rise of the modern bureaucratic
corporation, causes of the Great Depression, and the political economy of
contemporary America. In addressing these issues, the course considers more
general questions of what forces--cultural, economic, legal, etc.--shape the
pace and pattern of economic development in any society.

The required text for this course is:

Gary Walton and Hugh Rockoff, Economic History in the United States.

This will be supplemented by a course packet of readings. Readings will
average c. 100 pages a week.

There will be two one-hour exams and a final.

  

**HIUS 307 THE COMING OF THE CIVIL WAR**

Mr. Michael F. Holt

This lecture course closely examines American history between 1815 and 1861.
While its primary objective is to explain why a sectional conflict of long
duration between the North and the South produced secession and Civil War in
1861, it also addresses in some detail the events and significance of the so-
called "Age of Jackson." Economic development, westward expansion, and the
escalation of sectional antagonism between Northerners and Southerners over
time will all be addressed. But the primary focus of the lectures will be on
political developments in these years, for only those developments, I believe,
can explain why secession and war occurred when they did.

The course will have no discussion sections. Students' grades will be based on
a midterm examination, an 8-10 page paper on the assigned course reading, and
a comprehensive final examination. Students may take this course on a
Credit/No Credit basis, but I require at least a C final average grade to earn
a grade of Credit.

Readings for the course are **likely** to include the following:

Harry Watson, _Liberty and Power: The Politics of Jacksonian America_

William Lee Miller, _Arguing about Slavery_

Richard E. Ellis, _The Union at Risk_

Peter Kolchin, _American Slavery, 1619-1877_

Harriet Beecher Stowe, _Uncle Tom's Cabin_

Michael F. Holt, _The Political Crisis of the 1850s_

Minisha Sinha, _The Counter-revolution of Slavery: Politics and Ideology in
Antebellum South Carolina_

James M. McPherson, _What They Fought For_

  

**HIUS 313 THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN AMERICA, C. 1890- C. 1940**

Mr. Olivier Zunz

As the United States changed drastically from a society of individuals
attached to local forms of life to a society dominated by national
institutions, big business, and big government, Americans had to reconsider
the meaning of their democracy and reach an accommodation with new
organizational forms. The new patterns of authority and social relations they
developed coalesced into the "modernization" model of "goal-oriented change"
Americans would aggressively promote around the globe at mid-century. The
Emergence of Modern America will focus on the transformation that preceded and
facilitated America's ascension to world power.

Among the topics studied are the coming of big business and the regulatory
state, the first military-industrial complex of World War I, the invention of
R&D, the growth of research universities, and the modern organization of
knowledge. We will study also the landscape of new large urban and industrial
hinterlands; analyze the difficult encounters of class, ethnicity, race, and
gender both at home and at work; and examine changing life styles in a
consumer culture. Throughout the course, we will investigate the ways in which
Americans have attempted to keep their modern mass society democratic.

Readings will include such classic texts as Frederick Winslow Taylor's
_Principles of Scientific Management_ (1911) and Walter Lippmann, _Drift and
Mastery_ (1914) as well as some scholarly works. There will be one short
paper, one midterm, and one final.

  

**HIUS 316 VIEWING AMERICA, 1945 TO THE PRESENT**

Mr. Brian Balogh

THE BEST WAY TO DETERMINE IF YOU WANT TO TAKE THIS COURSE IS TO GO TO THE
CLASS WEB SITE AT
<http://moderntimes.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS316>[/](%3Cspan%20style%3D%22font-
family:%20Times%20New%20Roman%22%3E%3Cspan%20style=%22text-
decoration:%20underline%22%3Ehttp://moderntimes.vcdh.virginia.edu/HIUS316%3C/span%3E/%3C/span%3E)

This "electronic" source book contains the syllabus, lecture outlines, and a
rich collection of primary sources that we will use over the course of the
semester.

Viewing America will examine how Americans experienced some of the major
events that shaped their lives. We will view what millions of Americans did by
watching feature films, news reels, and footage from popular television shows
and news broadcasts. We will also read primary and secondary texts that
explore among other topics, the domestic impact of World War II, America's
reaction to the atomic bomb, the rise of the military-industrial-university
complex, the emergence of the Cold War, the culture of anxiety that
accompanied it, suburbanization, the "New Class" of experts, the Civil Rights
movement, changing gender roles in the work place and at home, the origins and
implications of community action and affirmative action, the War in Vietnam,
the Great Society, the counterculture, Watergate, the environmental movement,
challenges to the authority of expertise, the decline of political parties,
structural changes in the economy, the mobilization of interest groups from
labor to religious organizations, the emergence of the New Right, the
challenge to big government, the end of the Cold war, and the role of the
electronic media in politics. We will try to see history as Americans viewed
it while it was being made, by examining video clips from news reels,
television and movies, photographic sources, audio documents and print
sources.  We will also read scholarly assessments of the period.

This is a demanding course that requires two pages of writing each week,
assigns approximately 150 pages of reading each week along with a required
film.  You will also be asked to review a broad range of primary sources on
the electronic source book each week.

The course encourages student participation.  For instance, one "writing
assignment" is the "Create your Own Unit" project. Students work in teams to
suggest the content of the final unit. These units are posted on the web, and
the class votes to determine which unit will actually be taught.  Last year,
students elected "Hip Hop America" (unit #13 on the Electronic Source Book.)
The semester before that, students elected "Family in the Nineties" and
mandated that I organize a lecture around the Itchy and Scratchy episode of
the Simpsons.  I shudder to imagine what the next class will select.

  

**HIUS 323   THE RISE AND FALL OF THE OLD SOUTH**

Mr. Edward L. Ayers

This course will explore the emergence and destruction of the most powerful
slave society of the modern world:  the American South.  It will begin with
the sixteenth century and extend through the Civil War and Reconstruction.  We
will examine the lives of slaves and slaveowners, small farmers and large
planters, men and women, soldiers and civilians.

Readings will be diverse, including original documents, materials on the Web,
fiction, and secondary accounts.  Requirements include a midterm and final as
well as a substantial research paper; the course fulfills the Second Writing
Requirement.  Energetic participation in a weekly discussion section is a
central part of the course.

  

**HIUS 351 THE DIPLOMATIC HISTORY OF THE UNITED STATES TO 1900**

Mr. J. C. A. Stagg

In the space of little more than one hundred years, from the outbreak of the
American Revolution to the beginning of the twentieth century, the United
States underwent a remarkable transformation in its standing among the nations
of the world. Beginning as a weak union of Atlantic coast colonies that
struggled to survive the era of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars,
the United States within fifty years had come effectively to dominate the
North American continent. By 1900, the United States had acquired imperial
outposts in the Caribbean and the Pacific and had further made a claim to be
considered as the arbiter of the balance of power in East Asia. The
territorial growth of the nation was also accompanied by a commercial
expansion that made the United States the most dynamic economy in the world at
the beginning of the twentieth century. The class will consider the variety of
historical interpretations that have endeavored to explain both the
transformation in the international status of the United States and the
relationship between its territorial and commercial growth.

This will be a lecture class with some sessions devoted to discussion. The
requirements will consist of one paper, a midterm, and a final examination.
The required books include:

Jonathan Dull, A Diplomatic History of the American Revolution.

Thomas Hietala, Manifest Design: Anxious Aggrandizement in Late Jacksonian
America.

Walter LaFeber, The New Empire: An Interpretation of American Expansion,
1860-1898.

Robert Tucker and David Hendrickson, Empire of Liberty: The Statecraft of
Thomas Jefferson.

Thomas Paterson, et al, American Foreign Relations: A History to 1920 (5th
ed).

Thomas Paterson, et al, Major Problems in American Foreign Relations, Volume
1: To 1920 (5th ed).

James Lewis, John Quincy Adams: Policy Maker for the Union

Kristin Hogonson, Fighting for American Manhood: How Gender Politics Provoked
the Spanish-American and

Philippine-American Wars

  

**HIUS 361 HISTORY OF WOMEN IN AMERICA FROM THE COLONIAL** **PERIOD TO 1869**

Ms. Cindy Aron

This course will examine women's social, political, cultural, and economic
position in American society. We will study the shifting ideological basis for
women's roles, as well as the effects of race, class, ethnicity, and region on
women's lives. Topics covered will include women's political role, access to
education, legal position, sexuality, family responsibilities, and
participation in the work force. We will explore both how women used their
defined role to carve out increasing areas of influence in the world around
them, and the limitations of "sisterhood" across economic and racial
boundaries.

There will be two lectures and one discussion section each week. There are no
prerequisites, but a basic knowledge of U.S. History will be helpful. Readings
will average approximately 150 pages per week, and will include five or six
books and a packet of articles. The written work for this course will include
a midterm, a final, and a 5-8 page paper.

Possible texts include:

Carol Karlsen, The Devil In the Shape of a Woman

Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl

Jeanne Boydston, Home and Work

Harriet Beecher Stowe, Uncle Tom's Cabin

Amy Srebrick, The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers

  

**HIUS 365 AFRICAN AMERICAN HISTORY,** **1500-1870**

Mr. Dylan Penningroth

Of all the people who crossed the Atlantic Ocean before 1820, three out of
every four came from Africa. HIUS 365 explores the experiences, politics,
economics, and social life of those Africans and their descendants. We will
look at the lives of women and men, black farmers and enslaved people, whites
and blacks, from the 1500s to 1870. Requirements include lively participation
in weekly discussion sections and three papers. The readings average between
100-150 pages per week and include four or five books and a variety of
original documents. Non-History majors are welcome.

Likely texts include:

John Thornton, _The Kongolese Saint Anthony_.

St. Clair Drake, _The Redemption of Africa and Black Religion._

T. H. Breen and Stephen Innes, Myne Owne Ground: Race and Freedom on
Virginia's Eastern Shore, 1640-1676.

  

**HIUS 367 HISTORY OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT**

Mr. Julian Bond

This lecture course will examine the history, philosophies, tactics, events,
and personalities of the Southern movement for civil rights from 1900 through
the late 1960s, with special concentration on the years from the mid-'40s
forward.

The Southern movement--variously called the black struggle, the freedom fight,
or the civil rights movement--was a black-lead mass movement which effectively
ended legal segregation in the South by the middle 1960s. Through the
leadership of various national and local organizations, and through anti-
segregation campaigns directed by indigenous and extra-communal leadership
figures who built on extensive networks of church, fraternal, and social and
labor organizations, drawing strength from a protest community rooted in black
America and created in response to white supremacy, the movement succeeded in
eliminating legal segregation in the United States. The movement's well- and
lesser well known proponents and opponents and their stratagems will be
examined.

Grades will be determined from two brief papers and a final examination and
section participation.

  

**HIUS 401, SCT. A HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Carl Bon Tempo

"Who's an American? Americanism and National Identity in the United States,
1945-1995"

What did Southern segregationists, African-American civil rights leaders,
feminists, and proponents of the fledgling New Right political movement have
in common during the 1960s? At first glance, not much. But upon closer
examination, it is clear that many of the leaders in these groups manipulated
the ideas and rhetoric of national identity and Americanism in order to
formulate their own answers to the question, "Who's an American?"

In this 401 seminar, students will explore how Americans living in the last
half of the twentieth century created and employed a political language called
Americanism and, in doing so, conceived of national identity. What was
Americanism and how did it relate to national identity? The two concepts were
closely related. One historian described Americanism this way: "[I]t can best
be understood as a political language, a set of words, phrases, and concepts
that individuals used - either by choice or necessity \- to articulate their
political beliefs and press their political demands." This "political
language" and these "words, phrases, and concepts" often rested upon
definitions of national identity and character.

The main goal of this course is for students to arrive at an understanding of
how definitions of Americanism and national identity varied during this period
according to which Americans did the defining - and according to their
distinct political, social, economic, and cultural agendas. During the first
third of the class, students will read selections (between 150 to 200 pages
per week) from a variety of works that offer definitions of both Americanism
and national identity. Discussions in these weeks will center on how race,
place, gender, class, and contemporary historical events contributed to the
many forms of Americanism. The readings will provide a methodological,
historiographic, and historical foundation for the last two-thirds of the
course, during which students will write a 25 page, primary source-centered,
research paper.

This seminar provides an opportunity for students to read cutting edge
scholarship about national identity, Americanism, patriotism, and citizenship,
as well as the opportunity to contribute to this scholarship with their
research paper. Possible paper topics include - but are by no means limited to
- the ways in which participants in debates about immigration policy, the
various branches of the Civil Rights Movement, segregationists in the South,
or the neo-conservative political movement of Barry Goldwater (or Ronald
Reagan) crafted definitions of national identity and an Americanist language
to satisfy its political and social agendas. Papers can address a variety of
topics and sources from almost as many angles. This wide scope, I believe,
will produce lively discussions and papers.

Texts will probably include: (We will read portions of these works and most
will be available via toolkit)

of Higher Education_ , and _The Reader's Digest_ on the formation and need for

**HIUS 401, SCT. B HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Michael F. Holt

"The North and Reconstruction"

Reconstruction was the political and constitutional settlement imposed by the
victorious North on the defeated Confederacy after the Civil War. Much has
been written about the framing of these policies in Washington and their
implementation in the South, and this literature is filled with assertions
about the reaction of the northern public to this post-war experiment.
Surprisingly little systematic research, however, has in fact been done about
the relative importance of developments in the South compared to developments
within the North itself to the northern public. The purpose of this majors
seminar is to undertake that investigation by examining the role of southern
Reconstruction vis-a-vis other kinds of issues and concerns in northern
elections between 1865 and 1876. After a few weeks of common reading, each
student will be assigned a specific election year for research. The objective
will be to read as many Republican and Democratic newspapers from the North as
possible for that year to determine what issues election campaigns focused on
and how central Reconstruction was in the appeals rival parties made to the
electorate.

Readings for this seminar will include the following:

David Donald, Jean H. Baker, and Michael Holt, _The Civil War and
Reconstruction_

Eric Foner, _A Short History of Reconstruction_

William Gillette, _Retreat from Reconstruction, 1869-1877_

  
  

**HIUS 401, SCT. C HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Johann N. Neem

"Founding the Nation: The Constitution in Historical Perspective"

This course will examine the historical origins of the U.S. Constitution and
Bill of Rights. We will read works by historians in combination with primary
documents to understand what the Constitution meant to its framers. We will
then compare this understanding to recent interpretations of the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights. The goal of the class is not only to understand the
Constitution as a historical document, but to question whether and how such an
understanding aids us today. Students will be expected to complete a research
paper analyzing an aspect of the Constitution or Bill of Rights as it was
understood in the founding era.



 **HIUS 401, SCT. D HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. George H. Gilliam

**"** Southern Progressivism: Government, Economy, Gender, and Race, 1890-1920
**"**

Progressivism has been called the "formative birthtime of basic institutions,
social relations, and political divisions of United States society as it
evolved towards and beyond the mid-twentieth century." Though the period is
best-remembered as the time when the public regulation of big business
started, the seeds of today's civil rights, environmental protection, and
public health and occupational safety movements also were planted during the
progressive era.

Southern Progressivism has been complicated by its intersection with virulent
racism. State constitutional conventions held in the South between 1890 and
1910 to create the framework for progressive regulation of business at the
same time took steps effectively to disfranchise African-Americans and poor
whites. C. Vann Woodward concluded that "Southern progressivism generally was
progressivism for white men only, and after the poll tax took its toll not all
the white men were included."

Scholars have not fully explored the _aftermaths_ of those state
constitutional conventions in the South, however, and have left to others to
explore whether progressive administrative institutions regulated or promoted
business, and to consider the role such regulators played in the
implementation of Jim Crow laws. The enforcement of Jim Crow laws and the use
of black convict labor in the South provided an impetus for Americans to form
the NAACP during this period. Rapid industrialization and urbanization pushed
women to organize for protective legislation and for reforms in public health
and education. This seminar will provide students the opportunity to explore
the intersections of progressive reformers, regulators, the business
communities, and the forces of racial segregation. Students interested in
turn-of-the-century race regulation, the early women's movements, as well as
those who are interested in the relationship between the variegated business
communities and progressive regulators should be rewarded. The common readings
and seminar discussions also will expose students to stark divisions within
the business communities as well as to the nascent women's movement and to
issues of race and class that seem particularly pertinent to the changing
social landscape of the period.

The course will include five weeks of required readings designed to provide a
common understanding of the period and a range of different historical
experiences and questions relating to Progressivism. The average weekly
reading load will be 120 pages and will include selections from traditional
works such as Richard Hofstadter's _The Age of Reform_ , from revisionist
works such as Gabriel Kolko's _The Triumph of Conservatism,_ as well as more
recent scholarship including Edward L. Ayers' _The Promise of the New South_
and Noralee Frankel, Nancy S. Dye, eds., _Gender, Class, Race, and Reform in
the Progressive Era_. By the sixth week of the course students will submit
their paper topics in the form of a two-page proposal that outlines their
preliminary research plan. During the next several weeks students will meet
individually with the instructor. The entire class will also meet several
times during the middle of the course so that students can discuss their
research progress, learn about each other's work, and help their peers with
any research obstacles they may encounter. The primary goal of the seminar is
to assist students in learning how to conduct their own research and will
culminate in a paper 25-30 pages in length, based on original research in
primary sources. That paper is intended to fulfill the second writing
requirement.

  

**HIUS 401, SCT. E HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Joseph F. Kett

"The Transformation of American Higher Education, 1870-1960"

American higher education experienced a number of notable changes in this era,
so many, in fact, that they constituted a virtual revolution. The period
witnessed the emergence of the modern university, with its emphases on
graduate and professional education, its stress on research, specialization,
and science (both natural and social), and its growing ties to corporate
wealth. Colleges were also transformed, as they sought to define a distinctive
mission for themselves in the age of the university. With considerable
difficulty, women made their way into both universities and colleges, both as
students and as professors. Male and female students developed cultures of
their own, which both accommodated and resisted the new shape of higher
education. Finally, colleges and universities experienced considerable and
controversial democratization in the wake of World War II.

During the early weeks of the course we will read and discuss some major
studies of this period, including Lawrence Veysey's The Emergence of the
American University. With the instructor's assistance, each student will
select a research topic pertinent to one of the following three areas: the
university; the college; the movement of women into higher education; the
student culture.

  

**HIUS 401, SCT. F HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. Kent Germany

"The Politics of Race in America after 1954"

How has race mattered? From 1954 to the present, American race relations have
undergone a dramatic transformation. This seminar will examine aspects of that
transformation. For this course, the term "politics" is defined in its broad
sense and includes the personal, public, private, electoral, and cultural.
Readings will focus on the ways that African-Americans have built power since
1954 and the responses made by others to their efforts. The seminar's major
focus will be on the American South, but it is not limited to a regional
approach. In the first part of the course, students will develop topics for
their papers, while discussing and critiquing some of the literature
concerning the rise of Massive Resistance, the development of the
integrationist coalition, the growth of black power, and the counter response
to the Civil Rights Movement. After the first five weeks or so, the course
will be devoted to the student's production of a 25 to 30 page paper based on
original research. UVA has a wide range of resources that apply to this topic.
The reading load should average approximately 200 pages during the appropriate
weeks. Some of the probable readings are listed below, but may change
slightly. Completion of this course satisfies the second writing requirement.

Some of the probable readings include:

Carter, Dan T. _From George Wallace to Newt Gingrich: Race in the Conservative
Counterrevolution, 1963-1994_.

Goldfield, David R. _Black, White, and Southern: Race Relations and Southern
Culture, 1940 to the Present_.

Lawson, Steven F. _Running for Freedom: Civil Rights and Black Politics in
America Since 1941_.

Patterson, James T. _Brown v. Board of Education: A Civil Rights Milestone and
Its Troubled Legacy_.

pertain to the course.) Aspects of Massive Resistance. Corporate policies on
employment, marketing, pricing, production, and distribution. Case studies of
interracial relationships: political, economic, social, religious, romantic,
or otherwise. Student-teacher relationships after Jim Crow (or similar issues
in health care, social work, worship, etc.). The Economics of Inclusion.

desegregation, antipoverty programs, fair housing, policing.

  
  

**HIUS 401, SCT. G HISTORY SEMINAR**

Mr. David Shreve

"The Political Economy of the U.S. in the 20th Century"

Does economic theory matter to public officials? And when it does matter, how
is it transmitted to or absorbed by office holders and their advisers? To what
extent, for example, do social scientists, journalists, and historians--or
larger interest groups--shape the way interested public officials digest and
explain economic theory and apparent economic trends? How significant are
federal, state, and local policies--singularly and collectively--in
determining the direction and trajectory of the American economy? How
important are microeconomic principles and changes--in credit markets, or in
the realm of corporate management, for example--compared to the more widely
discussed phenomena associated with broader fiscal, monetary, or international
trade policies? And how are changes in this realm connected to public policy?
To what extent have policymakers failed to understand basic economic
principles, and to what extent have economists failed to understand the
constraints under which most policymakers operate? And what does U.S. economic
history itself tell us about the relative success of economic policy,
sufficiently guided or not by advances in economic theory, throughout the 20th
century?

Focusing on the intersection of economic theory and public policy, and on the
changing body of evidence with which social scientists and historians have
assessed the American economy, this seminar will address these basic
questions; make plain the methods, advances, and language of economics as
practiced throughout the 20th century; and suggest ways by which properly
armed historians may help explain the course of the U.S. economy and the
public policy choices which may or may not have affected it.

The class will be conducted on a seminar discussion basis and students will be
required to read the following works in their entirety:

Herbert Croly, _The Promise of American Life_

**HIUS 403, SCT. A READING ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE**

Mr. Olivier Zunz

Alexis de Tocqueville has contributed to the idea of America with such
brilliance that he has helped Americans define themselves. Despite his own
deeply-felt ambivalence toward the egalitarian, individualistic and
voluntaristic trends he observed during his American voyage of the 1830s, the
young French aristocrat became one of the first theoreticians of the United
States as an archetypical society built on the voluntary associations of free
individuals in a weak state.

Few authors, however, are quoted (or misquoted) as often and read so rarely.
This course is an attempt to remedy this situation. By reading _Democracy in
America_ , _The Old Regime_ , excerpts from Tocqueville's correspondence, and
selections from a vast scholarship on Tocqueville, we will engage the French,
European, and American contexts in which Tocqueville's thoughts evolved and
were received on both sides of the Atlantic. We will discuss the significance
of Tocqueville's conceptualization of civil society for interpreting American
history and its relevance for our own lives. We will study also the recent and
unexpected discovery of Tocqueville's ideas in former communist countries.

Students will report regularly in class on the readings as well as write three
short papers: one on Tocqueville and his informants, one on a major theme in
Tocqueville's works, one on Tocqueville's interpreters.



**HIUS 403, SCT. B AFRICAN AMERICANS AND SPORTS IN** **THE TWENTIETH CENTURY:
A SOCIAL HISTORY**

Mr. Reginald Butler

John Hoberman argues in his recent book, _Darwin's Athletes,_ that in the 19
th and early 20th centuries sports were completely racialized as evidence of
white superiority and a rationale for European colonial hegemony. The
demographics of sports have changed dramatically in post industrial America.
This course examines the history of African Americans in competitive athletics
and the historical transformations in the rhetoric and meaning of the
relationship between athleticism, race, gender and nation. The course is
structured around the seminar. Students will read and discuss a variety of
texts in anthropology, history, american studies, and literature. Gena Dagel
Caponi, _Signifyin(g), Sanctifyin, and Slam Dunking_ , John Hoberman,
_Darwin's Athletes_ , and C.I.R. James, _Beyond a Boundary_ , are a few of the
books that we will read. Students will also read extensively in magazines and
journals as well as view material from popular and documentary film, and
television. Students will write weekly reading responses and a major paper of
twenty to twenty five pages.

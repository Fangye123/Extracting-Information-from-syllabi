MEMORANDUM FOR Army 101 Students

SUBJECT:  Syllabus for Army 101  


1.  Course Title.  Organization and Function of the Army

2.  Course Description.  This course is designed to give students an introduction to the U.S. Army and Army ROTC.  Activities to develop students' leadership abilities in conjunction with this class may include any one, or a number of the following:  rappelling, rock climbing, rifle marksmanship, obstacle courses, paintball, etc.  The course covers topics such as the constitutional provisions for establishing a national defense; customs and traditions of the Army; the Army writing style; the roles and interrelationships of the Active Army, National Guard and the Army Reserves; an introduction to the various branches of the Army; the role of noncommissioned and commissioned officers; the law of war and the code of conduct; military ethics and other topics.  This class also includes a leadership laboratory.

3.  Course Objective.  The objective of this course is to broaden your exposure and understanding of the U.S. Army, as well as the development and enhancement of leadership skills.  As part of the ROTC experience, you will participate in classroom instruction, leadership labs, and perform duties as a cadet leader on a rotating basis.  You will also have the opportunity of participating in several adventure activities.  In addition, you will have the opportunity of participating in a weekend field training exercise at Fort Indiantown Gap, Pennsylvania.  Cadets in previous years have experienced such things as weapons training, leadership reaction courses, land navigation courses, and helicopter operations. 

4.  Semester Calendar.  Several events occur during the course of a semester.  You will find a semester calendar and weekly updates on training events, locations, uniform required, and times, on this website.  Refer to these pages frequently. 

5.  Attendance.  You are expected to be present for all classes and leadership labs, and to attend Physical Training (PT).  Attendance and participation represent 40% of the final grade.  Cadets who have received a scholarship and are contracted are required to attend PT at least three times per week.  If you have any questions regarding your status and/or the requirement for PT attendance, ask your instructor before the end of the first week of class.  Other adventure training, field training exercises, weekend activities, and fund-raisers are optional, but you will receive extra credit for attending and/or participating in these events. 

6.  Physical Training (PT).  A regular exercise program benefits an individual both mentally and physically to meet the challenges of today's demanding world.  Physical fitness is very important to the U.S. Army, and as a member of ROTC, you will learn about the benefits of physical fitness as you actively participate in Physical Training (PT).  PT is conducted five days per week for one hour, starting at 0700 hours (7 AM-8 AM).  We will meet at the gymnasium each morning.  You will receive credit for your attendance and performance in PT.  Cadets who have received a scholarship and are contracted are required to attend PT at least three times per week.  Non contracted cadets are required to attend PT at least once per week but are highly encouraged to attend more than the minimum.

7.  Uniform.  The uniform for classroom instruction is civilian clothes.  We will issue (lend) you all the necessary items pertaining to the Battle Dress Uniform (BDU),  which you will be required to wear once per week during leadership labs for approximately two hours.  The uniform for Physical Training (PT), will be regular exercise clothes and running shoes. 

8.  Assignments.  As part of this course, you will prepare an autobiography covering the most important events in your life.  The purpose of this autobiography is to cause you to express in writing your personal history, educational goals and future aspirations.  The autobiography will be typed.  The instructor will grade the paper on four factors, and it will represent 10% of the final grade.  Spelling, grammar and punctuation should be correct.  The length of the paper will be between 750 and 1000 words.  Completion of the autobiography is mandatory.  Papers are due at the beginning of class period 2.  You will be penalized for late submission of your autobiography.  Even if a paper is too late to receive any credit, the paper is a course requirement and must be completed. 

9.  Participation/Practical Leadership.  A large portion (40%) of your grade will come from participation and the application of hands-on, practical leadership.  This will be divided into four areas, each area consisting of 10% of the final grade:  1) Physical Training, 2) performance and attendance at leadership labs, 3) classroom attendance, and 4) leadership assessments. 

     a.  Attendance at Physical Training.  Physical training (PT) is conducted five days per week for one hour, starting at 0700 hours (7:00-8:00 AM).  We will meet in the gymnasium each morning.  As indicated above, you will receive credit based on your attendance and performance at Physical Training.  If you are a contracted cadet, you are obligated to attend PT at least three times per week.  Non contracted cadets are required to attend at least once per week but are encouraged to attend more often if possible. 

     b.  Performance and Attendance at Leadership Labs.  Many critical skills are taught during Leadership Labs.  Successful performance and attendance at labs may be defined as follows:  Arriving to Leadership Labs on time, with the right uniform, and fully participating in the training that will occur (i.e., staying for the full time period specified in the schedule, or until completion of the lab, whichever occurs first).  If you are unable to attend the regularly scheduled Leadership Lab due to a class conflict, make arrangements with the ROTC cadre for attendance at the makeup Leadership Lab. 

     c.  Classroom Attendance.  You are expected to attend class.  You will receive credit based on the number of times you attend class. 

     d.  Leadership Assessments.  This course is designed to teach and develop leadership skills.  The best way to learn and develop leadership is by practical application.  You will  have the opportunity to perform in a leadership position, and will receive feedback on your performance while serving in that position.  This may be verbally, in writing, or both.

Such acts of dishonesty include cheating or copying, plagiarizing, submitting another persons' work as one's own, using Internet sources without citation, fabricating field data or citations, "ghosting" (taking or having another student take an exam), stealing examinations, tampering with the academic work of another student, facilitating other students' acts of academic dishonesty, etc.

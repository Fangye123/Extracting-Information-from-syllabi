Course Organization

**PURPOSE AND SCOPE:**  
This course will examine the history of Latin America as seen from the
perspective of workers and peasants. While the history of the nation-state
continues to have a central place in the study of this region, during the last
two decades historians and other social scientists have begun to pay special
attention to the formation and experience of the opopularo sectors. This
course will introduce students to many of the principal themes in the study of
workers and peasants. These themes are as varied as reality itself and range
from economic issues that affect the social structure of a country to the
participation of peasants in revolts and revolutions.

We will examine aspects of the region's economic history, paying special
attention to the organization of land and labor and how these themes relate to
the structural creation of social classes. We will also explore more open-
ended aspects of the varied forms of peasant and worker political
mobilizations and participation and how they have affected the formation of
the Nation-State in these countries. The course will further consider how
peasants and workers have had different experiences based on ethnic, gender,
regional, or national differences. We will also examine some case-studies of
popular culture. All of these discussions will be carefully framed in the
context of the popular-elite relations, and the history of the nation-state
and supra-national forces **.**

**DETERMINATION OF GRADE AND REQUIREMENTS:**  
Half your grade will be determined by your class participation, weekly written
work and attendance. Students will prepare weekly 2-3 page discussions papers
on the readings and participate in presentations of the assigned materials.
Sometimes these short assignments will be a summary or discussion of the
readings. Other times I will ask you to answer specific questions. The other
half will be determined by a take home exam based on our class readings. This
essay will be described on a separate sheet later in the semester. There will
be no outside reading or research required for this course, only careful,
consistent engagement with the assigned materials. Weekly assignments are due
on the Thursday of the week the materials are t **o be discussed and/or
presented.**

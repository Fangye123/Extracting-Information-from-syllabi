"America has been good to the Jews...but American tolerance is about to be put
to a momentous political test" - Comment on Joseph I. Lieberman's Democratic
Party nomination for Vice-President of the United States.  
  
Historically Jews have shown a striking resilience at surviving ambient
contempt in the countries they lived in, but not until their arrival in the
United States have they confronted the mixed blessings of a society dedicated
to promoting their civic and material success. Why and how did American Jews
remain "Jewish" in America's open and relentlessly secularizing society? For
American Jews who "made it," what, if anything, remained Jewish in their lives
and how did that distinctive American-Jewish residue revise and transform both
traditional Jewish existence and America's progressive self-understanding?
How, in short, did a fundamentally Christian America and successive waves of
Jewish immigrants endeavor to live together?  
  
This course offers students a chance to explore questions about the conflict
and concert of cultures. In a spirit of intellectual honesty, reflecting the
realities of Jews in America, there are hardly any easy answers, so our
emphasis will be on sifting and evaluating historical expression. We will
spend our time, then, reading formative, "period"material (fiction and
nonfiction) and some defining, interpretative material; discussing it in
class; and evaluating it in three take-home papers. Standard lectures as well
as exams parroting course information thankfully lie beyond our province. To
keep us honest, 40 percent of your grade will depend on your participation in
class.

An extra-credit research paper, due on December 20th, could increase your
final grade by one or two increments. You must talk to me first about your
intentions. Missing class more than three times will lower your grade by one
increment; more than six times, two increments; etc. Please observe customary
classroom protocol by arriving to class and submitting original papers on
time, remaining in class throughout the period, and by taking notes on
assignments and bringing them and source material to each class.  
  
I enjoy exploring and discussing the intriguing issues that invigorate the
history of American Jews and look forward to exploring them with you in and
outside class. Feel free to contact me anytime. I can promise that this course
will reward your involvement. --DBK.

### Catalog Description:

History and structure of cable television industry. Cable regulations and
programming. Entry of telephone companies in distribution video. Analysis of
all relevant technologies: direct broadcast satellite, fiber optics cable,
high definition television, and others.

### Real Course Description & Goals:

This course will examine a wide range of new and emerging telecommunications
technologies. We will consider the historical and future impacts of these
technologies on existing and emerging industries, the policy and economics
driving the implementation of these technologies, and their adoption and use
by consumers. It is hoped and expected that students will come out of this
course with:

  * an understanding and appreciation for new technologies and their impact on media and society 
  * an understanding of how historic social, political, and economic forces shape the introduction and impact of new technologies 
  * an ability to critically examine the potential impact of new technologies and/or technological policy 

### Course Requirements:

##### Attendance and Discussion (10%)

: While attendance is not strictly required, it is expected that students will
come to class prepared, and will contribute to the lectures and discussions.

##### Net Assignments: (20%):

A series of assignments will be given to encourage exploration of, and use of,
the Internet and the World Wide Web.

##### Tests (30%):

There will be two tests given in class, each worth 15% of the final grade. The
tests will combine multiple choice, short answer, and essay questions.

##### Term Paper (40%):

A substantial paper (15-25 pages) examining and analyzing some scholarly or
practical question related to cable or emerging technologies. There are four
basic options:

  * Option A: A report on some existing application of cable or emerging technology. Pick some firm offering a communications service utilizing cable or emerging technologies. Provide a historical overview of that service or usage, a detailed consideration of the current applications and market, and critically analyze the future potential for that firm or service.  
_examples: use of video-conferencing by UT, DBS, viability of Sega Game
channel, Internet shopping malls_

  * Option B: An in-depth analysis of a specific technology or application of technology. This should provide a historical overview of the development of the technology, a report on the current level of development and use, and a critical analysis of its future potential (in general).   
_examples: future of HDTV, development of Information Superhighway, video
dialtone, digital radio_

  * Option C: An examination and analysis of the social, political, or economic impact of cable or other emerging technology. This paper should set forth a thesis, and provide an extensive review of the relevant literature, and should include a thorough development of an argument in support of your thesis. _examples: impact of HDTV and satellites on movie theaters, the impact of new technologies on political change in Eastern Europe, effect of C-SPAN on politics in US_. 
  * Option D. An examination and analysis of how social, political, or economic factors have shaped the development of cable or new technologies. This paper should set forth a thesis, and provide an extensive review of the relevant literature, and should include a thorough development of an argument in support of your thesis.  
_examples: impact of break-up of AT &T; on videotext; economics and HDTV;
impact of new legislation_

The broad range of potential topics and perspectives is designed to allow the
students to pursue their own interests in this class. In addition, students
may approach the paper as an individual or a small group project. If you work
in a group, the quality expectations will be commensurably higher, although
the page requirements may not be.

You should approach the professor with a topic proposal by Oct. 1. At this
time you should also indicate whether you are interested in working solo, or
in a group. You will also be required to turn in (by Nov. 3) an extended
abstract (3-5 pages) outlining your topic/research question and proposed
direction for the paper, along with an annotated bibliography of sources
already collected. The abstract and bibliography is worth 5% of the final
grade.

You are encouraged to think about turning the paper in early. Every effort
will be made to grade papers and return them quickly. If you turn them in
early enough, you will have an opportunity to revise and resubmit the paper by
the final deadline of 14 Dec. 1995, at 4:45 pm (end of scheduled final
period). Only the last grade on the paper will be used in the calculation of
the course grade. The completed term paper is worth 35% of the course grade.

You will also be expected to make a short presentation of your paper's
findings/conclusions at one of the final class meetings. Early presentations
will be treated as works in progress (that is, students are not required to
have a completed term paper at the time of presentation if they are presenting
prior to 14 Dec 1995.

### General Requirements and Notices:

  * All materials to be turned in for this class must be typed, or printed on at least a NLQ computer printer. They should be double-spaced, with normal font sizes and margins. 
  * No extensions on the term paper will be given. Students with valid excuses may be given an opportunity to make up tests and other assignments. The instructor is the final arbiter of excuses and their acceptability. 
  * While students are encouraged to study and work together, it is also expected that all work turned in will be original and individual-- plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in a score of 0 on the plagiarized work and/or notification of appropriate authorities. If you still have any doubts as to what plagiarism is, consult your various handbooks and guides, or ask the instructor. 
  * The instructor is willing to work with students with special needs, and make any necessary special arrangements possible to facilitate their learning experience in this class. However, those individuals will need to consult with the instructor about their needs as soon as possible. 
  * The instructor reserves the right to modify the course schedule and requirements. Any changes will be announced during class meetings and in the class listserve.

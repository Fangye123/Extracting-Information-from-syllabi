**Introduction to Introduction to Computer Science:**  
  
This course is the introductory course for a major or minor in Computer
Science at UTSA. Students majoring in other fields may wish to consult the
requirements for their major in the catalog for possible alternative courses:

  * CS 1073: Introductory Computer Programming for Scientific Applications 
  * CS 2073: Computer Programming with Engineering Applications 
  * CS 2083: Microcomputer Applications 

All students are welcomed to take CS 1713; however, this course is very
intensive and designed specifically for the computer science major/minor, as
opposed to the general computing audience.

There are two main purposes of CS 1713. The first is to introduce the student
to elements of computer science in a problem solving context. The second is to
guide the student through learning a high-level programming language (C in our
case) while he or she writes programs of increasing complexity, preparing the
student for the next course in the computer science sequence, CS 1723: Data
Structures. **Note:** you **must** have taken MAT 1093 before taking this
class. Concepts introduced in precalculus are very important in computer
science. You are encouraged to take MAT 1214, Calculus I concurrently with CS
1713.

Students will learn about:

  * Basic concepts of computation. 
  * Basic use of the Unix operating system. 
  * The edit/compile/run cycle under Unix with ` cc`, `vi`, and `make`. 
  * Data types and precision. 
  * Arrays and matrices. 
  * Functions and subroutines. 
  * Records 
  * File handling. 
  * Sorting and searching. 
**Course Requirements:**

  * **Programming Assignments** (15% of grade):   
There will be approximately eight programming assignments to be done in C. The
programs will apply the problem solving concepts you learn in class. They will
be scored on a scale of 1-10 with the grades depending on:

    * Whether the program compiles without errors or warnings; 
    * The degree to which the program behaves correctly and instructions were followed; 
    * Adequacy of documentation; 
    * Style (discussed in class).  We will be using UTSA's ` runner` computer to do the assignments. If you have a computer at home, you may use it to develop your programs, but the project you turn in must work correctly on and be submitted from `runner.` You will normally turn the programs and output in by e-mail, with exact instructions given in the assignment. Although the programming assignments are 15% of the grade, they are the most important part of the learning process since doing them is how you learn to program. 
  * **Progress Reports** (10% of grade):   
Each time a program is due, each student will submit an article from his or
her ` runner` account to the UTSA newsgroup  utsa.cs.1713-2.d  giving an
overview of the work he or she has done on the current assignment ( **without
giving any C code** ), his or her impressions on what was discussed in class
since the last report was submitted, and at least one question about computer
science or programming. These articles must be in the students' own words and
will be graded according to content as well as grammar and spelling; part of
being a computer scientist is the ability to express yourself clearly. The
articles are expected to be thoughtful and not composed hurriedly at 11:55 the
night they're due. Your single-spaced article should normally fill two
screenfuls on a VT320 terminal (48 lines); more is fine. Note that the
newsgroup is a public forum; anybody at UTSA will be able to read the article
(although only the individual students will know the grade they made), so you
are making an impression.

  * **Midterm Exam:** (15% of grade):   
There will one mid-term exam. This will be a closed book exam consisting of
true/false, short answer, and essay questions, and small programming problems.

  * **Second Exam:** (20% of grade): The second exam will be given toward the end of the semester. It will cover material up to that point, and be similar in format to the midterm. Note that it is worth more than the midterm. 
  * **Final Exam** (25% of grade):   
The final exam will be comprehensive. It will have much the same format as the
mid-term, but will be approximately twice as long.

  * **Lab Component** (10% of grade):   
You will be evaulated on your performance in the lab by the lab instructor.
This may include (but is not limited to) problems from the book and/or quiz
grades.

  * **Class Participation** (5% of grade):   
During the lab (CS 1711) sections and class (CS 1713), students are expected
to ask questions and participate in class discussions. This also includes
discussions on the class newsgroup,  utsa.cs.1713-2.d . Students should read
the newsgroup frequently. Read your classmates posts and respond to their
questions if you know the answers. Also, important announcements (such as "the
due date has been changed") may be posted to the newsgroup; look for such
messages. If you have a question in class, ask it. Chances are that someone
else has the same question. If the instructor poses a question to the class,
and you feel you know the answer, answer it.  
  
**Note:** Late programs are not accepted. Late progress reports are not
accepted. You are given enough time to do the assignments if you start early.
Your lowest program and progress report grades will be dropped, so if you have
an emergency and can't complete an assignment, your grade will not be
affected. If you have two emergencies, bring the instructor documentation and
we'll talk. If you have to miss a test, you need to inform the instructor
**before** you miss the test through e-mail or calling the division office. In
this case, you will be allowed to substitute another grade or take a make-up
test at the instructor's discretion.

##  A Word About the Computer Science Major

If you are a computer science major, you have chosen to enter a fascinating
world where the barely imaginable has become ordinary just in the past few
decades. There is an enormous amount of knowledge and learning that goes along
with getting a degree in this field, and with understanding the technology
behind the magic. Most of this learning occurs not during the class lectures,
but in the long hours you will spend in the lab, the discussions you will have
with your classmates and instructors outside class, the middles of the night
when you wake up and realize how to solve some programming problem, the second
and third time you take Calculus I, etc. This learning only comes with hard
work. If you don't learn the concepts presented in CS 1713 but somehow manage
to squeak by with a C anyway, you will not be prepared to take the next
course. You will eventually need to learn the material anyway. So take
advantage of this opportunity and give this class the attention it deserves.
The instructor is happy to see you in his office or answer your e-mail or
newsgroup question.

##  Academic Dishonesty

Unless a programming project is specifically assigned as a group project,
students are not allowed to work together on programs. You may discuss general
ideas related to the program, but you may not e.g. share program code or read
each others programs. Instances of such collaboration will be dealt with
harshly, but the real cost comes when a student doesn't know how to answer
questions on a test about issues involved in doing a project.

**Course Description** :

The psychosocial experiences of refugees and forced migrants encompass a broad
range of topics, which will be explored during the first half of this course.
Topics include: ethno-cultural concepts of mental health, sources of stress
and coping in refugee populations, the impact of forced migration on child
development, psychosocial consequences of sexual victimization and torture,
and the interaction of trauma and bereavement.   The second half of the course
will focus on the challenges of developing and implementing an effective
psychosocial program.   Culturally appropriate mental health assessment
strategies, community-based intervention programs, and methods of program
evaluation will be reviewed and illustrated with case examples from
Palestinian, Sudanese, and other refugee populations.

Students will be assigned to psychosocial problem-solving teams.  Throughout
the semester, these teams will be presented with psychosocial cases involving
"real life" ethical and practical dilemmas to analyze and solve.  Students
will be expected to keep up with the assigned readings and participate
actively in class discussions.

**Course Requirements:**

_Class Participation_ : Students are expected to attend class regularly and
participate actively in class discussions.

_Group Presentation_ : Students are expected to review a current psychosocial
program for refugees and present an in-class critique of their findings.

_Term Paper_ : Students are required to complete a term paper on an approved
topic related to psychosocial issues in forced migration and refugee studies.
Papers are due on the assigned date at the beginning of class.  Papers
received in the week following the due date will be marked down.  Papers that
are more than one week late will not be accepted.

_Examinations_ :  There will be two essay examinations given during the
semester.  Students will be given a choice of four out of six essay questions
to answer, using information from the assigned readings and class discussions.
Make-up examinations will be given at the instructor's discretion - in highly
exceptional circumstances only.

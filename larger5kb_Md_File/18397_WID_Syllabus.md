_  Advancing the status of women is not only a moral imperative, it is being
actively integrated into the foreign policy_  
_of the United States.   It is our mission.  It is the right thing to do and
frankly it is the smart thing to do._  
 \--Madeleine Albright (Secretary of State), 1997, instructing all U.S.
embassies to  
 consider the advancement of women's human rights as an integral objective of
U.S. foreign policy.

**Objectives**  
This course provides students with a general introduction to the issues
relevant to understanding the relationship of gender to socio-economic
development in less developed countries.  Theoretical perspectives and
empirical findings with respect to gender equity and development will be
examined to assess that relationship We will read and discuss cross-cultural
studies to gain an understanding of the differential effects of colonization
and "modernization" on women and their families, emphasizing the variable
impact of modes of production on women, men and children in both the
agricultural/rural and the industrial/urban sectors.

The changing division of labor by gender will also be examined and the factors
that influence the utilization of the female labor force in various sectors of
the economy (including the household) will be considered.  Particular
attention will be given to globalization and its contradictory consequences
for women.  Globalization refers not only to expanding markets across borders
and industrial restructuring but also to culture exchange (eg, migration,
consumption patterns). We will also look at its links to the commodification
of women, environmental damage, and structural adjustment policies.  Another
emphasis in the course are gendered health issues and health education in
developing countries.

Further, In light of the recent events, I am assigning a book to help to
better understand the lives of Muslim women in today's world.

We will conclude the course by examining women's social movements and
strategies for social change and empowerment.    The research suggests that
such change requires an improvement in the conditions of women's lives by
recognizing they must be active participants as well as beneficiaries in the
development process.  It also suggests a fundamental change in women's
relationship to men and to the larger social structure will be necessary.

The subject matter of this course has practical application and will be useful
for students intending to work in the field of international development, as
well as for students who simply want to learn more about the larger world we
live in.

**Reports**  
These papers may be on any relevant topic but you must let me know what your
topic will be in advance.  If you wish, you are invited to meet with me to
discuss the subject you have selected so I can assist you with some suggested
readings. I anticipate being able to point you to some useful literature.  Our
library has a very good selection of books and articles on the subject matter
of this course.  These papers are due April 22.

Possible topics are almost endless.  You might want to do a general analysis
of the status of women in one specific country or one ethnic group within a
country.  In this kind of paper you could provide: demographic information
(e.g., literacy, birth, death and infant mortality rates, life expectancy),
gynographic information (e.g., marriage policy, divorce, polygamy practices,
family policy, contraception), a description of the government and the
economy.  You could also address the issues we are reading about (e.g., labor
force participation, migration patterns, education).

Another approach is to take a general area and write in depth about it across
developing societies.  For example, you might want to look at the significance
of education for women and address its influence.  Other ideas:  Migration and
its effects on roles and social and economic well-being; purdah and its
consequences for women's labor; the division of labor in families; the work of
children; access of women to agricultural extension services; the availability
of appropriate technology.

Please follow this format for your report:  
1\. Statement of the problem.  What are the important questions that need to
be examined in relation to this topic?

2\. Review of the literature bearing on the questions you will address in your
paper.  Use citations to acknowledge the source of your comments.  For these
citations, use American Sociological Association style-- author, year and page
number (if quoting) in parentheses in the body of the paper.  E.g., (Blumberg
1993; Sacks 1988) or  (Elson and Pearson 1995) or (Shiva 1994, 67).   If you
wish to cite lectures:  (Riley 2002).  For details see PDF file:
<http://www.hass.usu.edu/~priley/Other/ASRPapers.pdf.>  There is also a link
there for the citation style to use for web references:
<http://www.apastyle.org/elecref.html>

3\. Summary and conclusions.  Include your suggestions for resolution of the
problem and indicate how your findings relate to the issue of development.

4\. List of references using American Sociological Association guidelines (see
web page listed above).  Any citations in this list should also be found in
the paper (and conversely, any in the paper should be referenced in full).  To
reference class lectures:  Riley, Pamela.  2002.  Lecture in Sociology 4730,
Women in international development.  USU, month/day.  
 Most references should be from academic sources and not from newspaper
articles or popular magazines.  I would expect an average of 10 different
references.  You may have many more but not many less!

5\. Plagiarism is not tolerated.  Give credit for every quote you use- author
and page number  (and please quote only when necessary).  Put your
observations in your own words. Plagiarism includes knowingly representing by
paraphrase or direct quotation, the published or unpublished work of another
person as one's own in any academic exercise or activity without full and
clear acknowledgment.  It also includes the unacknowledged use of materials
prepared by another person or agency engaged in the selling of term papers or
other academic materials."  (p. 10)  On the same page, you can find a lengthy
definition of "cheating."  [These are also printed under "Academic
Regulations" in each schedule bulletin.]

 On p. 14 of the code, under "Discipline Regarding Academic Violations,"
measures include warning or reprimand; grade adjustment; probation;
suspension; expulsion; withholding of transcripts; denial or revocation of
degrees; referral to psychological counseling.  
6.  Reports should average between 8 and 10 pages.

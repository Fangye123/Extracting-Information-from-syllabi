_Course Goals_** : In the 1990s, the United States continues to engage in a
debate, which has raged on and off throughout the century, over the
appropriate role of the federal government in providing basic sustenance for
the disadvantaged. Today, as in the past, this debate raises fundamental
questions about equity within a democratic nation. There is little consensus
on the causes of disadvantage, or the appropriate responses, or what part of
society - the federal government, state governments, or private charities \-
should be responding. What constitutes an acceptable minimum standard of
living, how race and gender interact with disadvantage, and many other issues
remain unsettled in political circles.

These questions have a long history, and American answers to them have
remained intact in some ways while shifting in other ways. This course will
explore the origin and path of this debate, and examine how the welfare state
has been shaped as a result.

  
**_Course Assignments_** : There are six short paper (2-3 pages) assignments,
each of which will count for 7.5% of the overall grade. These papers should
respond to a specific reading, either a book or an article, and must be handed
in BEFORE the first time the class discusses that book or article. (For
example, if you wish to write a paper responding to Linda Gordon's _Pitied But
Not Entitled_ , it must be handed in by the start of class on January 28th.)
You must do AT LEAST one paper in each section of the class. There is also a
term paper (10-15 pages, and 30% of the overall grade), which must be handed
in by Friday, April 25th. The nature of this paper and potential topics will
be discussed in class.

In addition, you are also expected to come to class every week and to be
prepared to actively discuss the week's reading assignment. Class discussion
will account for 25% of the overall grade.

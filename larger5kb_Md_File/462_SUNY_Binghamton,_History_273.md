        This is a survey of Chinese history from its neolithic agricultural origins ca. 5,000 BCE to the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644.  The course will consider state formation and the nature of the long-lived Chinese imperium, economic developments and the tantalizing though unfulfilled promises of a Chinese industrial revolution, the history of Chinese thought and religion, and the varied aspects of Chinese society and culture through the ages.  The course will stress translated readings from primary sources to help get as direct and immediate a sense of the Chinese past as possible. 

        The class will meet twice a week for informal lectures.  Discussion will be encouraged and slides used frequently.  This class is a writing (W) course and its requirements consist of:  a mid-term exam covering the first third of the course (20%), a final exam on the remainder of the course (40%), and a term paper of at least ten pages (40%).  In addition, all students will be required to pass a map quiz at the end of the second week of classes, though the quiz grade will not counted towards the final grade.  The term paper, which is described in a separate handout, can be on virtually any topic relating to China before 1644.  Since this is a writing course, the term paper will have three stages:  a brief description of your topic and your sources, which will be due October 5th; a draft of the paper due on Tuesday, .  The papers themselves are due on Tuesday, November 9th; and the final drafts of the papers, due on Tuesday, December 7th. 

        The readings consist a textbook (Schirokauer), two translations of Chinese philosophical classics (Confucius and Lao Tzu), a collection of Chinese short stories (Birch), and a book depicting the Chinese examination system (Miyazaki).  They are available for purchase at both the Campus Book Store and Bookbridge,  and are also on reserve in the Library.

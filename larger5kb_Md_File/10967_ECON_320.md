Intended Learning Outcomes

**

  * Develop a basic understanding of microeconomics, with emphasis on supply/demand market interaction and on the role of regulation in a market economy 
  * Develop a basic understanding of macroeconomics, with emphasis on the nature of the business cycle, unemployment, inflation, economic growth, and macreconomic policy. 
  * Develop a basic understanding of the workings of the U.S. economy and the nature of international trade. 
  * Develop a capacity for applying these basic concepts to explain the world around us, with particular emphasis on analyzing the economic content of the news, and on the various ways that economics is relevant to our lives. 
  * Enhance oral and written communication skills, and analytical capabilities. 
  * Recognize the role of economics in the California History-Social Science Content Standards for the grade level(s) the student intends to teach. 
  * By way of textbook materials, handouts, lectures, classroom discussion, classroom workouts, homework, active learning exercises, group-led conversations, and portfolio research and preparation, students will assemble the knowledge, tools, skills, confidence, and sophistication necessary for them to teach economics within the context of the K-12 curriculum.

Policies, Procedures, and Responsibilities

**

My responsibility as the professor is to lead and motivate students who are
committed to the learning process, and to determine the extent to which
students have mastered the material covered in this course. I am expected to
be courteous and respectful, to be responsive to student needs, and not to
discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity, or sexual or religious
preference. Grades are assigned based on my professional judgement of the
quality of your work and are not subject to negotiation. Students are
responsible for their learning outcomes and their performance on all
assignments. Students are expected to attend class regularly and on time, are
expected to be active learners who contribute to the classroom discussion, and
are expected to be courteous and respectful of others. Please contact me if
you have a problem or a conflict relating to the course.

All late or missing work will receive a grade of "0." The only exception is
for serious and compelling reasons, which are limited to documented and
serious illness, hospitalization, death in the family, or equally important
reasons. If you have a serious and compelling reason for missing or late work,
you must (a) notify me in writing, describing the reason, and (b) provide
satisfactory documentation. If I judge your circumstance to be serious and
compelling, I will offer you an alternative to receiving a "0." This is not a
matter that is subject to negotiation.

Help me to create a friendly, inclusive, and rigorous classroom culture in
which everyone is welcome to comment and contribute, and in which diversity is
respected.

Graded Items

**

A. 35 percent: One _comprehensive mid-term examination_ , the format of which
may include multiple-choice, short-answer, mathematical problem-solving,
diagrammatic interpretation, and essay. Date: Thursday 8 March 2001. The keys
to several previous midterms are on reserve at the library.

B. 40 percent: One _economic portfolio_ , due Tuesday 24 April 2001. Examples
from last semester are on reserve at the library, though note that the order
in which entries are to be presented this semester is different from last
semester. The packet will be made up of eight individual entries. The first
entry will be a narrative description of the economic content of the
History/Social Science Content Standards for the grade level(s) you intend to
teach. The second entry will be a lesson plan for an active classroom learning
exercise in which students learn one or more economic concepts. The last six
of the entries will be news analysis.

Instructions for setting up the portfolio: Use plain white paper, stapled in
the upper left hand corner. Include a cover sheet with your name, the course,
and the date written on it. The second page should be a table of contents
listing each entry and the page number for the entry. Do not use a fancy
3-ring binder or any plastic coverings. There are eight entries in the
portfolio, which should be assembled in the following order:

  1. Economic Content of the History/Social Science Content Standards: Your first entry is approximately 2 - 3 double-spaced pages of narrative that clearly identifies and discusses all of the economic concepts that are to be covered in the grade level(s) that you intend to teach, as listed in the [History/Social Science Standards](http://www.cde.ca.gov/board/), California State Board of Education. Note that the HSSS lists broad topics or concepts to be covered, such as the Gold Rush, but you will have to describe the economic aspect of the topics (for example, what economic forces caused thousands of people to travel across the continent to California, the economics of why food and supplies were so expensive in the gold fields, etc), sift out which of these are economic in nature, or have an economic dimension, and relate them to what we have discussed in class. You should use _direct quotes_ from the HSSS for topics that have an economic dimension, and then identify and dicuss the economic dimension and how you might approach it in the classroom. I will grade you based on how completely and carefully you have identified the economic dimensions of the HSSS for the grade(s) you are covering, your understanding of economic concepts, and the quality of your narrative (i.e., use correct english grammar). A copy of the pre-publication version of the content standards is on reserve at the library and on the Internet. 
  2. Lesson Plan: Your second entry should be for a lesson plan, preferrably one that uses active learning methods, that clearly involves one or more economic concepts. Your entry should be neatly typed. At the top of the entry, describe the economic concept(s) being taught, any sources you used in developing your _original_ lesson plan, the grade level(s), any special materials needed, and the amount of time required. Your description must be sufficiently detailed that I could successfully facilitate the activity on my own. Do NOT simply recycle a lesson plan developed by someone else. 
  3. News analysis: Each of the remaining six entries will be made up of: 
    * A recent newspaper or magazine article, mounted neatly on a piece of white paper. 
    * One page of double-spaced and typed news analysis. At the top of the analysis sheet you must clearly identify the title of the news story and the economic concept(s) underlying the story. In the body of the analysis you must describe the economic concepts as they relate to the story. Use good english grammar and correct economic reasoning. 
    * Carefully mount on a third piece of paper a diagram, illustration, or numerical example for the economic concept you identified in the news story. Make sure that the diagram, illustration, or example is fully labeled, easy to understand, and employs correct economic principles.  
Grading on the packet: I will grade based on quality of economic content,
quality of writing, and correct format.

C. 15 percent: A number of unannounced _in-class group workouts_ from the
textbook. Grading for each workout is "1" if you participate as a member of a
group that turns in a completed workout sheet, and "0" if you do not. Your
grade on the workouts does not depend on the number that you get right or
wrong.

D. 10 percent: One 30-minute interactive student group-facilitated
_conversation_ on an economic topic, policy issue, news item, or the economic
content of the History/Social Science Standards. Other examples include a
conversation built around an economic profile of Humboldt County, the job
market for educators, the economics of public school funding, an analysis of
the relationship between education and poverty, etc. The difference between a
_conversation_ and a presentation is that a _conversation_ is interactive with
the audience, and the group facilitating the conversation is responsible for
getting the audience involved with the discussion. Groups must prepare for the
conversation in much the same way as for a formal presentation, except that
the groups must also work out how to get the rest of the class fully engaged
and participating. Your grade will be based on the quality of the economic
content for the group's portion of the conversation, and on the mechanics of
the facilitated conversation (e.g., pacing, handouts, relevant multimedia,
visual aids, ability to solicit participation and respond to questions).

E. One optional comprehensive final examination, the format of which may
include multiple-choice, short-answer, mathematical problem-solving,
diagrammatic interpretation, and essay. The key to several previous final
exams is on reserve at the library. Date/time: Thursday 17 May 2001 @ 8:00 -
9:50. Your final exam grade will replaces your mid-term exam grade if it
exceeds your mid-term exam grade. Otherwise it will not count. You can choose
to take a "0" on the final exam if you are happy with your mid-term exam
grade, and it will not affect your final grade.

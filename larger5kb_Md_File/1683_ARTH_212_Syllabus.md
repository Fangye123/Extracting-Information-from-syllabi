**Catalog Description:  
** A survey of the visual arts in Western Europe from the end of the Ancient
world to the Late Gothic period. Emphasis placed on the development of
regional styles and the survival of the Greco-Roman tradition. (LA, CW, IH)

**Purposes of the Course:  
** 1) To acquaint you with the major monuments and developments/
transformations in the art of the Middle Ages.  
2) To acquaint you with the variety of ways scholars have approached the art
of this period, and to give you the opportunity to read, think, look, and
write critically about art and art history.

**Course Requirements:**

1) This course will be conducted in a lecture/discussion format. I would like
to encourage as much active participation in the class as possible.

2) The World Wide Web presents us with a phenomenal resource to study art.
Images and other materials can be made immediately accessible to students. I
intend to take advantage of this resource. I will be posting materials
relevant to the course on this course's Web site:
http://www.oneonta.edu/~farberas/arth/ARTH212/ARTH212_SYLLABUS.HTML I plan to
post material to help you prepare for class discussions and seminars. To keep
up to date, check the page entitled "[ARTH 212
Assignments](arth212_assignments.html)."

3) Journal: 25% of Final Grade. Every student will be expected to maintain a
Journal that will document your participation in the class. You should keep
your journal in a one-subject, 8 1/2 X 11" spiral notebook. Regularly I will
be posting materials on the course's Web site that is intended to prepare you
for class discussions. Accompanying these materials will be questions intended
to focus your thinking about the topic. You are expected to record your
responses to these in your Journal. Regularly check "ARTH 212 Assignments" to
keep up to date.

Periodically the entry on the "ARTH 212 Assignments" will ask you to e-mail me
your reponses to Journal assignments. These responses will be used as a basis
for class discussion. You will be expected to e-mail your entries to me no
later than 10:00 AM of the day of the class. This will give me the time to
review responses before class. I will keep a record of who has responded to
these assignments, and this will be a factor in your final grade.

4) 3 short papers (3-5 pages): 75 % of Final Grade. At least 2 of these will
be seminar papers. At least three times during the semester, the class will
focus on a major monument of Medieval art. You will be given materials in
advance of the seminar to help you prepare for it. A week following the
completion of the seminar you are expected to submit to me a 3-5 page,
typewritten paper presenting your response to the discussion. It is expected
that these responses will focus on a particular aspect of the topic.

The first seminar will be devoted to an examination of the mosaics of the
church of San Vitale in Ravenna. The second seminar will be devoted to the
Carolingian Renaissance: Renovation versus Innovation. The third seminar will
be devoted to the Royal Portals of Chartres Cathedral.

At least 2 of the short papers will be seminar reports, but for the third
paper you will have the option of focusing on a topic of your own choice.
Again I expect a 3-5 page paper, and you should explore the appropriate
research materials available to you. You must get my approval of your topic
before you start.

All papers and your Journal must be submitted to me by the last day of
classes. Any student who has not completed all of the assignments by this date
will receive an "F" in the course unless they have have consulted with me in
advance of the deadline.

Empirical Industrial Organization and Regulation  
Spring, 1998  

  
**Course Description**

     The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the Economics of Industrial Organization and Regulation with a bias towards covering relevant empirical work in these areas. The goal is to introduce students to some of the core topics within this literature and to prepare students for doing their _own_ empirical work in the field.

     Reflecting the theoretical focus of the material taught in Economics 388, the emphasis in this course will be on empirical topics. In the first part of the course, we will discuss empirical papers in the Economics of Industrial Organization, analyzing topics including but not limited to some of the theoretical topics discussed in Economics 388. In keeping in line with the more traditional focus of this course, in the second part of the course, we will turn our attention to the Economics of Regulation. Due to the scope of the material being presented in this course, we will emphasize in the lectures and required readings only some of the core topics in these fields. The reading list has been designed to present interested students with both the required readings (marked with an *) as well as introductory papers in sub-fields outside those considered in lecture.

**Prerequisites:**

     Although there are no official prerequisites for taking this course beyond a strong working knowledge of the material taught in the first-year core, it is _incumbent_ upon students to have a solid working knowledge of basic applied econometric techniques. The vast majority of the material covered will join economic theory with econometric implementation of that theory and so knowledge of just the former will be insufficient for a complete understanding of the material presented. For example, the material presented in Economics 344 (Econometrics I) should be very well understood. Concerned students should consult with me prior to enrolling in the course if they feel that they might be inadequately prepared.

**Readings:**

     The readings consist largely of published articles in economics journals; there is no textbook. The starred (*) articles have been collected and placed in the student lounge (Social Sciences 306) for reference and copying. Note, however, that if you remove the binder to copy the papers, _please_ return it as quickly as possible.

     Useful references for the first part of the course are Tirole, _The Theory of Industrial Organization,_ for theoretical topics and Scherer and Ross, _Industrial Market Structure and Economic Performance,_ for instituational information. Useful references for the second part of the course include Viscusi, Vernon, and Harrington, _Economics of Regulation and Antitrust_ , D.C. Heath, 1992 (denoted in the readings as VVH) and Train, _The Economics of Regulation_ , which covers in some more depth the theories of economic regulation considered here. An excellent review of most of the major fields in Industrial Organization can be found in Schmalansee and Willig, eds., _The Handbook of Industrial Organization_ , 2 vols., 1989. These volumes are denoted in the readings below as _The Handbook._

**Course Requirements:**

     There will be several theoretical and empirical problem sets, two in-class presentations, and a final paper reflecting the foundations of an original empirical research project on the part of the student. The first presentation will be conducted at the midpoint of the course and will substitute for a mid-term examination. A take-home final exam may be substituted for the presentation and paper for sutdents planning _not_ to write dissertations in the field. A presentation of one of the starred papers will substitute for the mid-term presentation for these students.

     Students are encouraged to work on the problem sets in groups, although each individual student will be required to return their own individual write-up of the solutions. Groups should be no more than 3 students. 

    In addition, where possible, I will present the class with a list of questions which will be asked about the material covered in the following lecture. These may be obtained from the course web page. (http://www.econ.duke.edu/~gsc/courses/econ389) Students will be expected to have thought about the questions and be prepared to answer them during the discussion of the material during the following lecture. To encourage such participation, a relatively large fraction of the grade for the course (20%) will depend on such class participation. The remainder of the students' grades will depend on problem sets (20%), the mid-term presentation (20%), and the final paper or exam (35%).

**Mathematical Prerequisites** : Mathematics 3113 (C- or better) and College
Algebra and Probability

**Topics** : This is the second semester of a two semester sequence for
elementary education majors. The material covered will be Chapters
7,9,10,11,13 of the text, including probability, real and complex numbers,
geometry, and trees. I will also have a small unit on elementary school
mathematics.

**Class philosophy** : Math 3113-3118 has several goals:

  * to encourage group learning in preparation for teaching, 
  * to develop reading and problem solving skills, 
  * to experience explaining mathematics at the board, 
  * to show that mathematics is creative discipline, 
  * to show that there are many correct ways of doing a particular problem. 
It is **NOT** the goal of this class to teach precisely the material you will
teach in elementary school. Hopefully from this class you will retain some
mathematical flexibility. You may have to learn new material while you are
teaching. Students may surprise you with their questions, these questions can
be related to what you are learning in this class. You should definitely read
the comments to the students in the preface of our textbook. This class is not
the usual lecture-recitation math class. Instead you will be cooperatively
working in groups and presenting solutions to the class. Our usual schedule
will be a variation of

1\. A student will present an assigned problem at the board for 15 minutes.

2\. I may say a few things for 15 minutes at the board.

3\. The class breaks up into several groups of size 4, and cooperatively works
on exercises for 30 minutes.

4\. We have a break of 10 minutes.

5\. Members of one group present the group's solutions to selected exercises
at the board.

6\. I may or may not say a few more things, but we continue with steps 3,5
until class is over.

During this process Mr. Rademacher and I will observe and offer suggestions
for your group. You may want a notebook to record your group work.

The groups will change every day.

**Grading and Exams** : There will be an in-class exam on each chapter (the
final exam will cover only the last unit). Your grade will be decided by the
following weights: exams 60%, in-class work and presentations 20%, homework
20%. If you miss class due to illness, an excuse in the form of a written
verification from your doctor is required. Otherwise your in-class grade will
be reduced.

Solutions to the homework problems will be posted on our web page. Late
homework is **NOT** accepted. You may work together on the homework problems,
but must write up your solutions in your own words. You will be presenting
homework solutions to the class. There will be an in-class exam after each
chapter. You may bring any books, notes, calculators you wish to the exams.

**Absence from exams** : Missing an exam is permitted only for the most
compelling reasons. You should obtain my permission in advance to miss an
exam. Otherwise you will be given a 0. If you are excused from taking an exam,
you will be given an oral exam, or your other exam scores will be prorated.

**Official University Grading Standards:**

**A** achievement that is outstanding relative to the level necessary to meet
course requirements.

**B** achievement that is significantly above the level necessary to meet
course requirements.

**C** achievement that meets the course requirements in every respect.

**D** achievement that is worthy of credit even though it fails to meet fully
the course requirements.

**S** The minimal standard for S is to be no lower than C-. The instructor or
department must inform the class of this minimal standard at the beginning of
the course.

**F** (or N) Represents failure (or no credit) and signifies that the work was
either (1) completed but at a level of achievement that is not worthy of
credit or (2) was not completed and there was no agreement between the
instructor and the student that the student would be awarded an I.

**I** (Incomplete) Assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, due to
extraordinary circumstances, e.g., hospitalization, a student is prevented
from completing the work of the course on time. Requires a written agreement
between instructor and student.

**Official University Statement on Academic Dishonesty:** Academic dishonesty
in any portion of the academic work for a course shall be grounds for awarding
a grade of F or N for the entire course.

**Official University Statement on Credits and Workload Expectations:** For
undergraduate courses, one credit is defined as equivalent to an average of
three hours of learning effort per week (over a full semester) necessary for
an average student to achieve an average grade in the course. For example, a
student taking a three credit course that meets for three hours a week should
expect to spend an additional six hours a week on coursework outside the
classroom.

**My Statement on Incompletes, S/N** : The grade ``I" is assigned only when a
student has satisfactorily (a C grade or better) completed all but a small
portion of the work for the course, and has made prior arrangements to
complete the work. This means, for example, if you quit attending class after
the second exam, and then request an ``I" in the eighth week, your request
will be denied. You will fail the course. To receive an S you need a C- grade
or better.

**Scholastic Conduct** : Each student should read his/her college bulletin for
the definitions and possible penalties for cheating. During the exam you must
do your own work. Students suspected of cheating will be reported to the
Scholastic Conduct Committee for appropriate action.

**Complaints** : You can address complaints about your lecturer to the
Undergraduate Head, Professor Lawrence Gray, Vincent Hall 115.

**Messages** : If for some reason you need to leave an urgent message, you can
do so at the School of Mathematics, 625-4848. You may also post anonymous
suggestions and comments on our class web page `
http://www.math.umn.edu/~stanton/3118`.

**COURSE MATERIALS AND REQUIREMENTS**

This one-credit course is an option for participants in the GMU Center for
Global Education's tour of  
Portugal in March 2002.  Students may enroll for one credit of ARTH 303:
National Traditions of Portugal  
or one credit of HIST 498: Directed Readings. Along with the experience of
travel and study in Portugal,  
students will be required to do assigned readings, keep a journal,  and submit
a written research report  
after the trip.  Agreed-upon topics will reflect the  historical or art
historical interests of each student,  
but all will pertain in some way to the itinerary of the trip itself and
include a field component.

**Requirements for Credit**

  * A preliminary meeting with me to establish your interests and assigned readings.
  * Assigned reading to be decided individually, reflecting the topic of the proposed site report.
  * Participation in all group tours.
  * Participation in two of my discussion sessions during the tour.
  * A daily travel journal, with illustrations (postcards or sketches)
  * An 8 to 10 page site report, incorporating the assigned background reading, field observations   
and library research.

  * The research paper and the travel journal  will be due on April 1 (no fooling!) which is two weeks   
after the trip returns.

**Sample site and research topics for ARTH 303:**

  * The monastic complexes such as Jeronimos, Batalha or Alcobaca
  * Specific Baroque palaces, gardens or city squares that we visit
  * Renaissance or Baroque Portuguese painters
  * Islamic influence on Portuguese architecture and crafts
  * The art of azulejos (painted tiles) at specific sites

**Sample site and research topics for HIST 498:**

  * Lisbon before and after the great earthquake of 1755
  * Navigation and ship-building in the age of discoveries
  * Islamic or Jewish Iberian culture and its afterlife
  * Role of the Church during the "Golden Age"
  * Effects of world trade on the material culture of Lisbon

**GRADING**

The final grade will be determined by an average of the work required, and
will depend heavily on the  
quality and seriousness of the written work, before and after the trip.

  * Preliminary meeting: 10% (credit/no credit)
  * Positive participation: 20%
  * Trip journal: 40%
  * Research paper: 40%

**Late work** : after the trip, work submitted late will be graded down, one
grade per week. Work must  
be handed in by the deadlines set by the University - **_no incompletes will
be given._**

**" Positive participation"** means participating in all the tour activities,
not creating problems for the  
group through tardiness or inappropriate behavior, paying attention to guides
and lecturers, and  
attending at least two of my lecture sessions during the trip itself. Normal
participation just described  
is worth a "B." An "A" will be given for great journal keeping, for enthusiasm
and energy, problem-free  
cooperation, group spirit, cultural sensitivity, and for intellectual
curiosity \-- **_in other words, for being  
a great traveler._**

**Site reports and research topics** will be chosen in consultation with me.
I'll try to be sure everyone  
has a different topic, so that the expertise will be spread around. I'll
distribute guidelines for the reading  
and reports as soon as I know you've registered.

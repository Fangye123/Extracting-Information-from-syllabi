###  Course Description

Design and implementation of multimedia presentations. Topics include hardware
and software aspects of multimedia systems, standards of multimedia storage,
compression techniques, authoring fundamentals, multimedia development and the
Internet, and current research topics in multimedia-based applications.
Students will build a multimedia application using prescribed authoring
software.

Prerequisite: Computer and Information Science 622X or a course in data
structures*

* waived for PIMA students in Fall 2002

###  Course Objectives

This course has two goals. The first is to teach theoretical foundations of
multimedia presentations.Supplementing our discussion of basic multimedia
types and their issues, we will cover concepts of usability engineering and
principles of sound user interface design. From this, students should develop
an appreciation and understanding of computer human interaction, and the
ability to apply it to the development of multimedia presentation systems.

The second goal is to give students practical experience designing and
developing multimedia presentations. Students will learn to use Macromedia
Director, Lingo, and the web for rapid prototypting and development. At the
conclusion of this class, students will have produced a multimedia application
that demonstrates their skills.

###  Textbooks

We will be using the following textbooks for this course:

  * Rosson and Carroll, **Usability Engineering** , Morgan Kaufman, New York, 2002.
  * Gross and Roberts, **Director 8 Demystified** , Peachpit Press, Berkeley, CA, 2000.

###  Course Materials

You will also need at least one floppy disk (100 MB Zip prefered) for saving
your work. _Please be sure to bring it to class so that you can save what you
do in class._

###  Course Requirements

Your grade will be based on the following criteria:

  * Term Project - 50%
  
Over the course of the semester, you will develop an interactive multimedia
presentation that aims to teach a specific topic or concept to a specified
audience. You will apply the usability engineering principles learned in
class, producing several deliverables (and making two presentations) which
will be graded seperately, as described in the [project
guidelines](CIS752project.html). You _must_ use Macromedia Director to develop
your application, _no exceptions_.

  * Presentations - 10%  
You will be asked to present your term project twice to the class: first in a
design review, second in a final presentation on the last day of class. The
purpose of these presentations is to provide you with valuable feedback. _You
must make these presentations on the dates indicated on the schedule!_

  * Exams - 40%  
I will also give you two exams to test your understanding of concepts and
issues. The midterm will be a closed book/notes exam given in class; the final
will be a take-home exam. In both cases, you _must_ do your own work on this
exam. _Cheating, copyright infringement, and plagiarism will not be
tolerated._ You must hand in the exam either on or before the due date.

###  Computer Facilities

If you are registered for this class, you have been assigned a unix account.
Go to the Atrium Computer Laboratory in the Plaza Building (1306) to activate
your account. You will need this account for posting your web page.

Director 8 is installed on the machines in our classroom. This is where you
will probably do most of your work. Director 8 is also available in the Atrium
classroom B (Plaza 1100b). If you prefer to work at home or at another
location, that's fine as long as you are still able to make the scheduled
presentations. _Be sure to regularly test your application in the classroom,
to make sure you can present it!_

###  Advice

Think of me as your cranky client. There may be times when you disagree with
what I say. You may think that some things are a matter of opinion, or that
you are right and I am wrong. Just remember that I am the one giving out the
grades. When I make a suggestion, be sure to listen, because it may have an
impact on your final grade.

Start your assignments and your project early. That way if you have trouble,
you can get help in time to finish your assignment by the due date. This will
also help you to avoid a last-minute crunch in the lab.

Don't be afraid to ask questions. If you don't understand something, it's
likely that your classmates don't understand it either. Raise questions in
class. If you need further explanation, come see me during office hours. If
you can't make my office hours, send me email. Be sure to do this before you
get hopelessly lost.

Work with other students. I do not mean that you should copy each other's work
(which will not be tolerated). Rather, you should learn from one another. If
you can't figure out how to make something work, see how your colleague did
it. It is also useful to discuss different ways of approaching a problem.

Please let me know as soon as possible if you anticipate any problems with
this class. If alerted to them early on, I may be able to accommodate your
needs.

The Student Course Review, December 1997 Edition


Review of courses offered
Spring Semester, 1997


Welcome

We would like to thank you for using The Student Course Review.  The
purpose of the course review is to provide you with comments and
feedback from other students about classes offered at Pomona.

We cannot stress enough the importance that this course review should
not be solely relied upon for course selection.  Please use this compilation
as a supplement, not substitute, to asking your advisor and other students
about courses.

The course review is a work in progress; in order to improve it we need
students' feedback.  Suggestions about the survey questions are
particularly welcome.  Please e-mail any suggestions you have to: 
 Senate@pomona.edu or any editors

Thank you,

Important Note:
Comments about courses are from only a portion of students in classes
and thus may not be representative of student opinion as a whole.  Please
note carefully the number of reviews received for a specific course.

Some classes are not represented because courses with three or less
responses were not published. We encourage all students to complete their
surveys and remind their professors to distribute the reviews as more
responses mean a more comprehensive review.  In addition we did not
review classes such as general chemistry and biology. 

Qualitative reviews are assigned according to the following:
*****                    Extremely Accessible
****                         Above Average
***                         Average (office hours only)
**                         Below Average
*                         Far Below Average

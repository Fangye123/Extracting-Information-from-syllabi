_Required texts:_

Gale E. Christianson, _Greenhouse: The 200-year Story of Global Warming_
(Penguin, 1999).

Mike Davis, _Ecology of Fear: Los Angeles and the Imagination of Disaster_
(Vintage Books, 1998).

J. R. McNeill, _An Environmental History of the Twentieth-Century World_ (W.
W. Norton, 2000).

Mikulas Teich, R. Porter, B. Gustafsson, eds. _Nature and Society in
Historical Context_ (Cambridge University Press, 1997).

Note: Abbreviations for readings assignments from the two texts by McNeill;
and Teich, et. al., eds. are as follows: Mc=McNeill; T=Teich. Note that
neither text matches the exact contents of the lectures. It is required,
however, that students will be prepared to be tested on the major arguments
and content of the Christianson, McNeill, and Davis text as well as assigned
portions of Teich.

_Course Plan:_ This class examines environmental problems in historical
context. After treating select environmental ideas and events at key
historical moments in the Western tradition it focuss on modern [post 1800]
events, ideas, and issues.

_Grades:_ Grades are calculated in the following manner: a mid-term (30%) on 7
May to be taken in class; a final (40%) to be taken during finals week; and an
essay of eight pages (30%, including 5% for the abstract) typed and double-
spaced (eight pages without the bibliography) to be built around a theme drawn
from Mike Davis, _Ecology of Fear._ Attendance at lectures is expected, and
students may have up to two unexcused absences without compromising their
grade.

_Instructions for the essay:_ All students need to have their essay topics
approved by the instructor. To get your essay topic approved, examine the
Davis volume and prepare _two_ copies of a typed single page with a working
title and a one-page abstract of the proposed topic. This must be handed in to
the instructor no later than the start of class on 23 April. The essay topic
must be relevant to the content of the course. The essay itself must have all
pages numbered and is to include standard bibliographic references, such as
footnotes or endnotes, complete pagination of articles or sources used, and
quotation marks or other attribution where appropriate. It must also include a
bibliography arranged in alphabetical order by author at the end of the essay
of fifteen sources _external to the class._ Only a maximum of three of these
may be from websites which are to be placed at the end of the other entries.
Each entry in the bibliography must be annotated with a brief annotation of no
more than three sentences which provides a succinct summary of the entry and
comment on its utility for your essay.

_Plagiarism:_ Do not violate UCSB's policy on plagiarism [which means
representing another's ideas or exact words as your own]. It is the
responsibility of all students in this class to have read and be familiar with
University Regulation 102.01.

**Course Objectives:** In this course we will look at the history of the
American theatre from its beginings to the present day. We will examine how
the American theatre has historically reflected the culture and how theatre
artists have tried to use the theatrical medium to change the country's basic
assumptions. Two points need clarification. 1) This class covers theatre in
the U.S. only, not the rest of the Americas. I didn't name the class, or it
would be called  "History of Theatre in the United States." Make no mistake, I
am not so ethnocentric as to assume that "America" means "U.S." 2) Although
this is a history class, we will be reading plays each week. This reflects my
belief that as far as theatre is concerned, you cannot get a true picture of
history without reading how dramatic literature was affected by it. This does
not mean that we will look only at text-based theatre. My personal interests
lie with non-text-based theatre, so I'll try to get in as much of that as
possible. We will not be studying the plays we read in terms of literary
concepts or script analysis, however, but will look at them for how they fit
with the theatrical practice and cultural milieu of the time. The plays will
serve as historical documents for this class.  
  
**Course Requirements:** 2 Exams and one 4 page paper, plus an in-class
presentation. Information about these assignments will be available on the web
site. The other significant portion of your grade will come from class
participation, which includes answering questions on the online bulletin board
system. Since history, especially theatre history, is not an exact science,
there is much room for debate about the causes of theatrical trends and even
about the basic characterizations of those trends. I will leave as much room
as possible for classroom discussion on topics of interest to you. I expect
you to come to class with questions and thoughtful comments in mind.

**Attendance Policy:** You are permitted 3 unexcused absences. Each subsequent
unexcused absence will lower your final grade by one-third of a letter grade.
Excused absences not only require prior notification if at all possible, but
you must also provide me with written notification by the Undergraduate Dean
and/or Health Services the next time you come to class. College policy
dictates that seven or more absences, whether excused or unexcused, will
result in a grade of WA (equivalent to an 'F'). Three tardies (5 minutes or
more) equal one absence. You must tell me at the end of class that you were
late or risk be marked as absent for the day.

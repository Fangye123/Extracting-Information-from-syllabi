>  REQUIRED READING:  
>  
>  In this course, we will carefully study judicial politics and behavior on
appellate courts including the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Circuit Courts of
Appeals, the state courts of last resort, and the appellate courts of other
countries.  We will read the leading works in the field of judicial behavior,
discovering that judges are not all that different from other actors in the
political system.  They are people after all, and their decisions are
therefore influenced by the same forces that influence other human decision
makers.   We will treat the judicial system not as an arcane, formal
institution, but rather as a political, policy making body that has a profound
influence on our everyday lives.  That being said, you will need to purchase
the following texts on the courts:

>  In addition to these texts, there are a number of articles we will cover,
all of which are in the copy room for your convenience.  (I've also provided
full citation information so that you might get the articles yourself from the
internet ([www.jstor.org](http://www.jstor.org) ) or from the relevant
journals in the library.)  The articles are listed under the days we will
cover them.  Be prepared - there is a lot of reading here!!  
>  
>  ORGANIZATION OF THE COURSE  
>  
>  In order to facilitate a large amount of student participation, the course
will consist of weekly discussions of the reading, each led by a member of the
class.  On the second day of class, the material will be doled out as much as
possible according to student interest in the particular topic (so look over
the syllabus before our next meeting!).  The number of times you will be
responsible for discussant duties depends on the enrollment in the course, but
each person will be responsible for leading the discussion at least twice
(sometimes with a partner).  I will take volunteers in the assignment of the
topics, but will assign topics to whoever catches my eye for those less
popular subjects/dates.   The person responsible for that day's discussion
must turn in a critical review of the reading along with some potential topics
for discussion to me by 5pm the day before that particular class meets. The
presenter should make his or her paper available to the other conference
participants as well.  (Bringing copies to class or leaving a copy in the copy
room with my stuff for others to copy will be sufficient.)  These papers will
comprise 20% of your course grade.  Attention should be paid to style and
grammar, although the primary purpose of the papers is to get you thinking
about the controversies each piece raises along with some potential points of
interest to take the class through.  Generally, these critiques should be
around 5 pages in length.  
>  
>  OTHER COURSE REQUIREMENTS  
>  
>  In addition to the short papers, you will be expected to complete a
conference-quality paper for presentation to the class.  We will use the same
format employed at conferences wherein I will set up panels that hang roughly
together and a non-presenting class member will serve as discussant on the
panel.  The details of the paper will be given as the due date draws a little
nearer, but for now, be thinking of a topic of interest to you in the field of
judicial politics.  In a couple of weeks, I will have you submit a proposed
topic for my approval and then you can begin your literature review and theory
formulation.  You may focus on any court or level of court, but bear in mind
that these papers must be quantitative in nature.  You might consider the use
of one of the existing judicial databases.  I will demonstrate use of the
United States Supreme Court Judicial Databases (Spaeth), as well as the U.S.
Circuit Courts of Appeals Database (Songer).  The State Supreme Court Judicial
Database (Brace and Hall) is not yet available, and while there is a proposal
pending for a database containing several countries' high court decisions, no
comprehensive database has been compiled to date.  I do have a few limited
comparative datasets should your interest lie in the study of courts
comparatively, so it's not impossible to do a comparative paper, and there are
some state court datasets on the ICPSR website and on other web locations
should your interest lie in the state or trial courts. You may also construct
your own dataset by reading and coding opinions, but be forewarned that this
will take some time!  (Note:  If you have not had a graduate-level statistics
course you may take the option of writing TWO research designs in lieu of the
quantitative paper.)  
>  
>  This conference quality paper, which I do hope you will propose to present
at one of the national or regional political science conferences, along with
your presentation thereof will be worth 50% of your grade; 40 points for the
paper, 10 points for the presentation.  An additional 20% (20 points) is
devoted to your participation as a panel discussant. The remaining 10% (10
points) is assigned to participation in general.  If I did my math correctly,
that adds to 100% and the grading scale will be as follows:

>>>>>>  
>  Do note, however, that ALL work must be turned in to receive a passing
grade, even though it is mathematically possible to miss a certain number of
points completely and still do relatively well.  In addition, work must be
turned in on the day that it is due - NO EXCEPTIONS.  I will CONSIDER
extensions in dire circumstances, but will be quite unlikely to give one
unless thoroughly convinced of its absolute necessity.  (That clear enough??)  
>  
>  A CAVEAT  
>  
>  I expect that you will behave professionally in this class.  That is to
say, I expect that you will be prepared for every meeting, will participate in
each meeting intelligently and to the best of your ability, will treat one
another with respect, and will take this seminar seriously.  With respect to
your papers, I expect you to be exceedingly careful in the preparation of the
manuscript so that there is no hint of plagiarism.  (You should cite all
quotations and paraphrases in accordance with the style sheet of the American
Political Science Review.)  In addition, you should take sufficient pride in
your work so that there are no egregious errors of fact and no typographical
errors.  Proofreading your manuscript carefully (and probably even having
another person read it for you) should go without saying.

relevant readings for each meeting.  The reading in boldface should be your

> This is an online course that is designed primarily to meet the needs of
students who cannot attend regularly scheduled classes due to distance from
campus or time conflicts.  It is intended only for capable and self-motivated
students in good academic standing.

> **PURPOSE OF THE COURSE/ OBJECTIVES**

>

> This is a survey course that covers United Stated history from early
settlement through the Civil War.  It is a 3 credit course that can be used to
partially fulfill the social science requirements for an associate degree
and/or as a transfer course applicable to the general education requirements
for a baccalaureate degree at a four-year institution.  The course is also
open to students who are not seeking a degree but are simply interested in
learning more about history.  [Note:  It is _not_ necessary to complete  [
History 121](../HIS121index.html) prior to taking History 122.]  The
objectives of this course are as follows:

>

>> ![](../navydot.gif)  Students will enhance their understanding and
appreciation of United States history.

>>

>> ![](../navydot.gif)  Students will develop their ability to write
thoughtful, clearly stated and well supported essays about significant
historical issues.

>>

>> ![](../navydot.gif)  Students will exercise their ability to think
rationally and critically (i.e., to differentiate between facts, opinions and
assumptions; to make logical judgments based on historical evidence).

>>

>> ![](../navydot.gif)  Students will improve their ability to learn
independently by experiencing various forms of instructional technology.

>

> **COURSE FORMAT**

>

> This course uses a web site, two textbooks and optional videotapes.
Optional Saturday review sessions will be held before each test.  Assignments
and test study questions may be obtained from the web site.  Students must
maintain regular communication with the instructor via e-mail and should
participate in online discussion via Blackboard.  Tests must be completed in a
supervised setting on campus (generally in the Learning Center).

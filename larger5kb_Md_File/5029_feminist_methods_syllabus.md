Last taught: Spring 2002 COURSE GOALS:

To examine feminist critiques of traditional research, knowledge, academic
disciplines, and the boundaries between them.  
To familiarize students with key theoretical and methodological issues and
concerns in feminist scholarship and interdisciplinary research.  
To enable each student to assess the status of women and of feminist research
in her or his fields of interest and academic discipline.  
To assist students in developing research and analytic skills appropriate for
exploring the vast literature of Women's Studies and to relate it to research
in traditional disciplines.

Note: The work load for the seminar is substantial, so it is imperative that
students learn to budget their time. Not every article or assignment deserves
the same amount of time and attention. One goal of this seminar is to help
students learn to make those distinctions and act upon them accordingly-a
crucial research skill!  


SEMINAR FORMAT:

This seminar shall consist of weekly in-depth discussions of the central
issues in the readings, in which we will analyze and critique them. Some weeks
will center on theoretical issues, others on formulating a methodological tool
box, and others dealing with political issues surrounding different methods.
You will be expected to work independently outside of class and to share the
fruits of your labor with the rest of us in class.  


SEMINAR REQUIREMENTS:

1\. Preparation and Participation (35%)  
This course is based on extensive reading and discussion of a wide variety of
material. It is imperative that students come to class prepared to discuss and
analyze the material assigned for that week. This means you should have read
all of the materials, taken notes on them (including noting areas where you
have questions or would like clarification), and devised your own questions to
stimulate group discussion. Your notes should enable you to discuss each
author (by name), her/his central points, and specific examples you want to
mention from her/his work. If you are making a presentation, you should have
an organized plan, a sense of timing, and any appropriate handouts.

Occasionally, you will be asked to write a short paper (2-3 pages) based on
the day's work (for example, you will be asked to apply readings to a film for
the second day of class). These homework grades will be added into this
segment of your total grade.

Asking Questions: Part of your preparation/participation grade will be tied to
your role in leading discussion into areas that interest you. Thus, each class
period, you must bring to class a written question relating to the reading
material for that day. You will bring a printed copy of your question (with
your name on it) for each member of the class including me. Part of class time
will be spent asking and discussing questions that you provide. The goals of
this are these: 1) to involve each of you in discussion; 2) to force you to
critically interact with the material; 3) to personally invest each of you in
the content of the course. You will turn in your questions at the end of each
period. I will give you feedback on forming questions and credit for writing
them. You will also get credit for your level of participation in class
discussion. Students will be assessed on how their comments and questions
reflect careful reading, comprehension of the material, thoughtful critique,
and original analysis. Simply talking in class does not necessarily constitute
informed participation. You will also be expected to guide conversations
toward your issues so that we can cover everyone's ideas.

Writing Abstracts: You have a great deal of reading in this class, and I want
to make sure that you sufficiently process the ideas therein. Thus, you are
required to write analytical abstracts of most of your readings. Each abstract
should be 2-4 typed pages long (regardless of the length of the reading). You
should succinctly summarize the major points of the reading (in about a page),
and then critically analyze the major insights of each piece. You will be
assessed on how well you pull out the main ideas of each reading, how clearly
you present each idea in your writing, and how thoughtfully (yet concisely)
you critique or analyze the major points. Writers benefit from abstracting in
that they must thoroughly digest the main points and write them down. Once you
have abstracted a piece, you usually never have to go back to the original-you
can rely on your abstract for key information. They are invaluable resources,
and constructing them is a valuable skill. You must write abstracts for all
five books, but you may choose to write abstracts for 7 out of 10 of the
assigned articles and chapters. You will write a total of 12 abstracts
throughout the semester. Abstracts are due on the days we complete the
reading.  


2\. Assessment and Critique of your "traditional" discipline (15%)

Students are required to write a short paper (5-6 pages) which provides an
assessment and critique of your discipline (especially epistemology and
methodology) as traditionally defined. You will need to seek out professors in
your own discipline and interview them about the state of research in your
field. When collecting information and writing this paper you should address
the following issues: What counts as knowledge? Who or what comprises
appropriate objects of study? What are the accepted methods and goals of
research? What are the accepted criteria for analysis and assessing the
validity of results/findings? What is the appropriate relationship between the
researcher and the research(ed)? Be sure to discern whether there are
methodological rifts in your discipline (such as the common
qualitative/quantitative split), and find out why these exist and their
current status. Your should draw upon relevant readings, field or survey
courses you have taken, your previous research and/or coursework, and your own
experience in the discipline. (Hint: this paper should require more critical
thinking than research.) Each student will also make a five minute
presentation of her/his discipline assessment to the seminar.  


3) Research Design Project (RDP) (40%)

Rather than writing an actual research paper, each student will produce a
detailed research design in this seminar. This will enable you - and the group
as a whole - to focus on the process of research rather than the final
product. The final research design should be 15-18 pages in length (typed,
double spaced). It should include the following elements: a statement of the
central research problem or question, a review of relevant literature, a
discussion of the importance, relevance, and contribution of this research, a
discussion of and justification for the specific method(s) to be employed, a
presentation of expected findings, and a statement of their relevance to
feminist scholarship and to your "traditional" academic field.  
Ideally, the design should be for a project you intend to undertake or are
already undertaking. It could be for a master's or doctoral thesis, a starred
or scholarly paper, or "just" a seminar paper. The specific topic must be
relevant to Women's Studies generally, and to issues discussed in this course,
specifically. The topic must be approved by the professor. Students are
required to arrange an individual meeting with the professor to discuss
potential topics in the fifth week of the semester. You can contact my by
e-mail before that. (Note: if the design is for a paper you are writing for
another course, please get the permission of that professor too.)

Each student must write a project proposal that describes your topic, its
relationship to existing scholarship, how you are approaching it, and your
progress to date. Students will provide copies of a draft of this proposal for
all members of the seminar group. We will conduct a semi-blind review process
of these initial drafts. I will assign each student to read and critique,
using a feminist style of evaluation, another students' work. You will be
graded on your feminist critique of a peer's work. You will also be required
to revise your own proposal based on the critique you receive of your own
work. The idea is for you to use this early, feedback to refine your own work-
as well as learning how to provide thoughtful, constructive feedback to
others. There is also much to be learned from observing how others conduct
their research. At the end of the semester, each student will present her/his
finalized research design orally in class.

4) Final exam: Take home cumulative exam (10%)

5) Miscellaneous (but really important) items:

a) Students are expected to attend all seminar sessions and to have completed
the reading and written assignments before the class meeting. Students are
expected to arrive on time.

b) To receive full credit, written assignments must be turned in at the
beginning of class. Written work turned in late will be penalized one third of
a grade increment for each 24 hour period.  


c) All written work should be either typed or word processed. Pages should be
numbered and stapled together.

d) This type of course requires that all participants be respectful of others'
perspectives and opinions. Students who are unwilling to expand their own
understandings or challenge traditional research assumptions should not take
this course.

e) Correct citation and bibliographic information should be provided any time
you use the words or thoughts of another, regardless of the formality of the
writing assignment. Plagiarism of any sort will result in an automatic "0" for
the assignment and, possibly, for the course.

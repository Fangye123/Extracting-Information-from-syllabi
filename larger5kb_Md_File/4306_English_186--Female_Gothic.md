WHAT IS THE GOTHIC?

\--"the darker side" of life; a world of pain and destruction/ fear and
anxiety which shadows the daylight world of love and ethereality

\--gothic fiction consists of a set of analyzable displacements about what it
means to be a human being and gendered;

\--it strains at the limits of mortality/immortality;  morality/immorality;
reason/emotion; order/disorder; mind/body; masculine/feminine

\--gothic fictions are structured as case histories of types of insanity

\--we as readers are asked to adjudicate various diagnostic accounts

\--pleasure/pain dichtomy: why do we enjoy reading these fictions?

\--the fiction as essentially a regressive fantasy: we peer back over our own
personal history because all psychotic states are simply perpetuations of
landscapes that we have all inhabited at some stage in our early infancy (we
all outgrow our "madness")

\--accounts of cultural and psychic dislocation

\--Barthes' enigmatic code: we identify with parts of the text whose primary
function is to keep us peristing in our reading by focusing our minds on
unanswered questions, upon a certain pattern of hiatus and expectuancy, unpon
a continually postponed hope for a resolution of the uninterpretability of
change

\--fiction of fear arises at times of great social and economic upheaval;

gothic fiction introduces a prolonged contemplation of the objects in the
individual's internal world at the same time there is a repeated vindication
of the individual's ability to survive despite threat

\--landscapes of childhood: narcissism; incest; violence and vampirism;
androgyny and sexual anarchy; the oedipal triangulation; the family romance;
projective identification (I am the Other) and splitting are the two dominant
psychological defenses

\--like other romantic texts, the gothic deals with interruptions in the
maturation process; they are tales of recuperation or reparation; resistance
to loss

\--the gothic exposes the essential instability of the domination and
submission patterns in the fantasy; creation of doubled characters; self-other
relationships revealed when we realize that the hero never shares the stage
with a heroine; if the text focuses on a heroine, then the male has to be a
split figure: villian or weak "hero"

\--in their quest for identity as masculine or feminine, all the characters
appear to be enthralled to fragmentation or disintegration





Robt Hume distinguishes between two sub-genres of gothic:

1\. novel of terror = Radcliffe (female)

2\. novel of horror = Lewis, Monk (male)

conventional trappings = heroine, hero and villian, clouds, castles, mystery,
inevitable travel sequence that transports the characters from everyday life,
educates the reader about foreign lands, and casts a general aura of mystery
about the proceedings

adult fairy-tale; immersion in "enchanted castle"; woman's body

assault on the castle gates, room = metaphorical rape

heroine leaves the known (childhood) to venture into unknown (adulthood);
pauses in a sterile wasteland (pre-sexuality) and then moves through a never-
never land (courtship, magic, illusion, dream) to arrive at full sexuality
(adulthood and chaste marriage).

inherent ambiguity and ambivalence lies at the core of the genre's appeal

orphaned heroine searches for surrogate parents, only to find her parents by
finding her self; her most sinister enemy is her own awakening sexuality;
heroine's task is to destroy the mythic beast within, for the wages of passion
are madness, disease, and death; virtues are repression and sublimination

orphans are social outsiders; they seek social approval and kinship

(Foucault on kinship and alliance)

values of silence, rectitude, balance (mind of a man and heart of a woman);
restrained emotions and strength of character; century's idealization of
Virgin Mary

heroine plays role of aetherialized maiden, brave young detective, symbolic
quester of her own and others' identities

theme of female powerlessness; motherhood was source of women's greatest power

"The posture of romantic victim concealed thwarted dreams of power"









Wolff, "The Racfliffean Gothic Model: A Form for Feminine Sexuality"

rpt. in _The Female Gothic_ , ed. Juliann Fleenor



men subscribe to the "virgin-whore" syndrome because they have split their
affectionate (and asexual) feelings from the passionate (and sexual) side;

they PROJECT their own feelings onto women they then label either "bad" or
"good"; they also invariable set up a rival for the women

women mirror this syndrome in their invention of the "Devil/Priest" syndrome
and their rivals usually take the form of a mother-figure

danger in the fiction is equated with an "inner space"--a secret room, etc,
within the larger castle/body

Edith Birkhead:  "Mrs. Radcliffe's heroines resemble nothing more than a
composite photograph in which all distinctive traits are merged into an
expressionless 'type.'"

Their only business is to experience difficulties

heroine has to earn her right to preside over the gothic castle

the pairing of the hero and villian in 18th century gothic each embody a sort
of authority that the heroine has to choose between; a violent taboo is
usually attached to the villian (again, recourse to Foucault's explanation
about the machinery of alliance and kinship in operation)

1950's: second Gothic revival; heroine now is allowed to marry the demon lover

"Power" is most prevalent word in these fictions

"The problem of love divided is now resolved in the direction of undiluted
sexuality, and the reading and rereading of modern Gothics gives comforting
reassurance both that sexuality is safe and appropriate for women and that the
primitive quality of this passion need never be compromised or relinquished"



*******"Better to try all things and find all empty, than to try nothing and
leave your life a blank" --Charlotte Bronte

*******"There is a joy in fear" ---Joanna Baillie







IS THERE A FEMALE GOTHIC [FG]?

Ellen Moers, "Traveling Heroinism: Gothic for Heroines" in her _Literary
Women_ (1976):

\--gothic fiction is concerned with fear: "fantasy predominates over reality,
the strange over the commonplace, and the supernatural over the natural

\--gothic fiction intends to scare and to get at the body itself, to our
physiological reactions to fear

\--gothic arose what religious fears were on the wane, giving way to that
vague paranoia of the modern spirit from which gothic mechanisms seem to have
provided therapy

\--the FG concerns a young woman who is simultaneously a persecuted victim and
a courageous heroine

\--the FG transforms the standard romantic issues of incest, infanticide, and
patricide into a fantasy of the nursery

\-- _Frankenstein_ , _Wuthering Heights_ , and _Goblin Market_ all concern a
girl's childhood and the adult woman's tragic yearning to return to it; all
seek a pre-adolescent love modeled after the sister-brother relationship; the
cruelties in all works are justified as realistic attributes of the nursery
world--and as frankly joyous memories of childhood eroticism

\--FG is characterized by the compulsion to visualize the self; where woman is
examined with a woman's eye

\--the fear in FG suggests the haunted and self-hating self

\--FG is characterized by traveling heroinism: traveling both outdoors and
indoors: the fg novel became a feminine substitute for the picaresque, where
heroines could enjoy all the adventures and alarms that masculine heroes had
long experienced, far from home, in fiction

\--the test in the fg allows the heroine to prove herself through courage and
self-control in the face of physical dangers

\--the fg heroine uses her sufferings as the source of her erotic fascination
(Marquis de Sade and the sadistic impulse)

\--property, decorum, taste in manners, social status, respectability are
touchstones for the fg heroine

\--the final gothic castle to be navigated by the fg heroine is the insane
asylum

notes on Christina Rossetti's "Goblin Market":

\--the poem's multiple heroines represent alternative possibilities of
selfhood for women

\--poem as sexual/religious allegory: "rape"of a lock of her hair causes Laura
to lose her virginity; once that is lost she is valueless

\--Lizzie (like Christ) intervenes offering a womanly holy Communion; she
changes her sister from a lost whore to a virginal bride

\--poem presents a world where men hurt and women redeem

\--poem posits a matriarchal world and more covertly, a lesbian world

\--girls eventually find redemption in the heaven of bourgeois domesticity

\--eating fruit recalls _Paradise Lost_ 's presentation of fruit as
"intellectual food"

\--eating fruit enacts an affirmation of poetic and sexual selfhood--eating
words; tasting power but the taste of words (artistic creativity) causes guilt

\--genius and sexuality are diseases in women, like madness

\--what are the goblins? it/id-like inner selves; desirous little creatures
that live in the haunted minds of women artists

\--poem suggests the need to suffer and renounce the self-gratifications of
art and sensuality

\--Lizzie, the word made flesh, forces Laura to devour her repressive wisdom,
the wisdom of necessity's virtues

\--poem as a lesson in renunciation

Excerpts from criticism of "Goblin Market":

Mary Wilson Carpenter, "'Eat me, drink me, love me': The Consumable Female
Body in CR's GM," _Victorian Poetry_ 1991: CR constructs a "marketplace" in
which "appetite" puts women at risk, but where her salvation is to be found
not in controlling her appetite but in turning to another woman; GM suggests
that female erotic pleasure cannot be imagined without pain, yet the poem not
only affirms the female body and its appetites but constructs sisterhood as a
saving female homoerotic bond.

Janet Galligani Casey, "The Potential of Sisterhood: CG's GM" in _Victorian
Poetry_ 1991: "The concept of a female Christ figures prominently in Cassandra
and GM, for both Florence Nightingale and CR believe that women, like men, may
be redeemers. For both of these writers, women have been unfairly relegated to
the roles of Mary/Martha and Eve, when the role of Christ is within their
grasp as well."

David F. Morrill, "'Twilight is not good for maidens': Uncle Polidori and the
Psychodynamics of Vampirism in GM," in _Victorian Poetry:_ Polidori published
his novel _The Vampyre_ in 1819 and committed suicide in 1821. "Suck" is the
central verb in GM, suggesting the erotic/oral compulsion in childhood
sexuality. CR equates the sexual act with a vampiric transference of energy;
in love relationships one partner gains mastery and fattens emotionally as the
other wastes away.

Paula Marantz Cohen, "CR's GM: A Paradigm for 19th-century Anorexia Nervosa":

How is it possible to remain innocent and whole, a perfect little girl,
forever? This is the poem's essential question as well as the question which
plagues the anorexic who, as she experiences the physical and emotional
changes of adolescence, wants desperately to preserve the simpler, more
familiar self of childhood.

Elizabeth Campbell, "Of Mothers and Merchants: Female Economics in CR's GM":

if you buy the fruits--if you buy a belief in a market economy couched in
religious terms--then you will surely die. But at this point in the poem,
temptation is everything, and goblin fruits represent something that the women
want, even if it is something they know they cannot have: a place where the
fruits are produced, a place in, and a piece of, the economic action.

Dorothy Mermin, "Heroic Sisterhood in GM": two girls live alone; they
encounter goblin men; they have children. Except for the word "wives' which
legitimizes the children, there is no mention of any men but the goblins, who
are explicitly male. The children are apparently all girls and are exhorted to
keep the female circle closed and complete. This is a world in which men serve
only the purpose of impregnation. Once both sisters have gone to the goblins
and acquired the juices of their fruits, they have no further need of them.











ENGLISH 186; THE FEMALE GOTHIC

TAKE-HOME MIDTERM EXAMINATION

DUE IN CLASS ON FEBRUARY 26, 1998



ANSWER ONE QUESTION FROM SECTION A AND ONE QUESTION FROM SECTION B:

SECTION A:

1\. The doubled or split woman is a dominant characteristic in female gothic
fiction and poetry. Analyze how she functions--what she symbolizes--and how
she contributes to the meanings of "Goblin Market" and "The Yellow Wallpaper."

2\. Fear of sexuality, anxiety, and nausea/disease are featured in female
gothic literature, most of time as responses to the constrictions and
oppressive power of the patriarchy. Analyze how the patriarchy is presented
and attacked or subverted in "Goblin Market" and "The Yellow Wallpaper."

SECTION B:

1\. Norbert Elias's _History of Manners_ presents his theory of "the
civilizing process," a gradual transformation of society by which the middle
class aped aristocratic values but increasingly justified its dominance by
pointing out the corruptions of the upper classes. Discuss the impulse of the
middle class to criticize aristocratic values and characters in _Jane Eyre_
and _Rebecca_ at the same time it celebrated a middle-class heroine. How does
the female gothic genre participate in justifying the middle-class takeover of
society?

2\. Both _Jane Eyre_ and _Rebecca_ make heavy use of similar patterns of
meaning and imagery: young penniless governess-type in love with older father-
figure; blocking older female-figures; and animals (birds, dogs) as surrogates
for the characters' emotions.

What do you make of the obviously oedipal structure of desire in female gothic
novels? What fantasies are being appealed to by the female author to her
largely female reading audience?



REMEMBER: No plot summary--we've all read the works. Offer a clear thesis in
the introductory paragraphy, and then provide support for your ideas by using
specific passages from the literary works you are analyzing. Your conclusion
then restates your thesis and points toward larger related issues.







ENGLISH 186: THE FEMALE GOTHIC

and treatment in real life as contrasted to her treatment in _JE_

\--fairy tales as sources for _JE_

\-- _Rebecca_ as film: the Hitchcock version contrasted to the BBC and A &E
versions

\--"The Haunting" as an adaptation of Jackson's novel

\--"Wide Sargasso Sea"--censored version shown in class with discussion of its
relation to the novel's treatment of Bertha and her mother

\--the gothic fiction of Joyce Carol Oates

\--black gothic: _Beloved_ as gothic

\--Southern gothic: Flannery O'Connor or Eudora Welty

\--Victorian gothic: Gaskell and other women writers collected in Dalby's
collection, _Victorian Ghost Stories_





THEORIES OF FANTASY AND THEIR RELATION TO LITERATURE:

"The day-dream is a shadow play, utilizing its kaleidoscopic material drawn
from all quarters of human experience, but also involving the original
fantasy, whose dramatis personae, the court cards, receive their notation from
a family legend which is mutilated, disordered and misunderstood.--Laplanche
and Pontalis, "Fantasy and the Origins of Sexuality" in _Formations of
Fantasy_ , ed. Victor Burgin

For Freud, fantasies, like nocturnal dreams, are an imagined scene
representing the fulfillment of a wish: "a happy person never fantasizes, only
an unsatisfied one (SE: "Creative Writers and Daydreaming")

Every fantasy, however, is also an articulation of a lack

For Freud the primal fantasies are the "seduction of three children [called
the heritage or seduction fantasy], the inflaming of sexual excitement by
observing parental intercourse [called the primal scene or origin fantasy],
and the threat of castration [called the fantasy of sexual difference]."
"These were once real occurrences in the primeval times of the human family,
and children in their fantasies are simply filling in the gaps in individual
truth with prehistoric truth" ("Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis").

The three primal fantasies--heritage, castration, and seduction--involve the
human subject's desire to solve the riddle of its existence, to explore the
issue of origins: who as I in relation to my heritage? what is the origin of
my body's anatomy? what is the cause of my drives, my desires?

Fantasies also generally center on scenarios of self-aggrandizement: the
plentitude of childhood is recaptured in the possession of a protecting house,
loving parents, and a safe autoerotic objects for the dreamer's affectionate
feelings

Fantasies are the means by which a hysteric can disguise the real traumatic
events of her childhood by translating them into an imagined scene that veils
a reminiscence without entirely obliterating it. Fantasies also mark the
moment of mediation between the conscious and the unconscious, given that
under the censoring aegis of repression, they merely screen an impossible
traumatic knowledge by modulating this forbidden knowledge into a belated and
distorted articulation.

Freud: "If hysterical subjects trace back their symptoms to traumas that are
fictitious, then the new fact which emerges is precisely that they create such
scenes in fantasy, and this psychical reality requires to be taken into
account alongside practical reality. This reflection was soon followed by the
discovery that these fantasies were intended to coverup the autoerotic
activity of the first years of childhood, to embellish it and raise it to a
higher plane. And now, from behind the fantasies, the whole range of a child's
sexual life came to light."





THE STRUCTURE OF THE THREE UR-FANTASIES AND THE PHYSICAL/PSYCHIC
MANIFESTATIONS OF EACH:

Definition: Fantasies are psychic structures of meaning that disguise real or
imagined traumatic events of childhood by translating those traumas into an
imagined scene that veils a memory without totally obliterating it. The
fantasy, in other words, allows the adult to master the childhood trauma in a
substitute formation.

Fantasies mediate between the conscious and unconscious mind because
repression will screens a trauma that can only be expressed after the event
and in a distorted fashion.

Fantasy precedes identity.--Laplanche

_REBECCA_ and fantasy from Alison Light, "'Returning to Manderley' _FR_ 16
(1984):

"Romance fiction deals above all with the doubts and delights of
heterosexuality [and] suggests that the acquisition of gendered subjectivity
is a process, a movements towards a social self, fraught with conflicts and
never fully achieved. Psychoanalysis takes the question of pleasure seriously,
both in its relation to gender and in its understanding of fictions as
fantasies, as the explorations and productions of desires which may be in
excess of the socially possible or acceptable."

"In the course of the novel the girl idealizes Rebecca as the expression of
all the other possible versions of female sexuality which her own middle-
classness excludes. Rebecca disrupts the girl's romantic model and leads her
to search for a 'successful' marriage which will also legitimize female sexual
desire. For the girl to find a secure social identity (a name) as Maxim's
wife, Rebecca's difference must be reinterpreted. From being the girl's
imaginary ideal, she has to become her nightmarish enemy. No longer the
perfect wife, hostess and lover, she is to branded by the end of the novel as
lesbian and whore."

"What the girl has to attempt, and what she must compulsively repeat in the
telling of the tale, is a kind of self-murder. It is a violent denial of those
other versions of female sexuality, which Rebecca has come to represent.
Rebecca, then, is the focus of the novel's conflicting desires for and
descriptions of the feminine....Going back is precisely what _Rebecca_ is all
about: returning to Manderley, to the primal scene of the acquisition of
femininity."

"The reader, like the girl, wants to be like Rebecca, but dare not. And yet
once that process of identification with Rebecca has been set in motion its
effects can never be fully contained nor its disruptive potential fully
retrieved. This narrative of wishful projection and identification,
displacement and repulsion is then the story of all women, of what we go
through in the constructing and maintaining of our femininity."

When the embodiment of bourgeois sexuality realizes how far she is from
Rebecca's polymorphously perverve sexuality, she contemplates suicide: "the
two sexualities cannot co-exist. This is the book's crisis. Now every attempt
must be made to separate Rebecca out from the girl's and the reader's
identification with her. Rebecca must be externalized, taken out of the realm
of imaginary projectiosns of subjectivity and put back into the world. This
means that in terms of the text, she must be forcibly reinscribed within that
range of social discourses which will condemn her difference and so legitimate
the girl's."

"The girl, in becoming narrator of the crime, transfers her identification
from Rebecca to Maxim, and invites the reader to do the same....she learns to
accept the regulation of female heterosexuality through class differences
which themselves necessitate sexual competition between women." The book
follows the "remorseless logic of a Bluebeard. Women are all the potential
victims of a femininity which is not just endlessly defining us in terms of
sexual status--we are wives, mothers, virgins, whores--but which marks us as
representing the sexual itself. Where women's sexual desirability is
competitively organized around male approval and social reward, there will
always be a Rebecca who is both an idealized alternative to our elusive
subjectivity and a radical undermining of it."

"For middle-class readers in the 1930s Rebecca's murder appears to offer an
ideal fictive solution to those all too seductive deviant femininities. It is
less than simple, however. Rebecca is no longer 'out there,' the wife in the
attic of the Gothic text, but inside the female subject, the condition of its
existence. The process of identification which the novel depends upon is, in
more ways than one, fatal. For Rebecca does, after all, get what she wants."

"Maxim's loss of place, of Manderley itself, is a social, psychic, and
fictional necessity within the terms set up by the girl's assumption of
Rebecca's position....the text equates Maxim's economic loss with a
psychological crippling, and can therefore atone for his crime. Losing your
stately home is a fair cop for murdering your wife."

But also note how "Rebecca is responsible for his loss of home, authority, and
even for the sunset of the Empire...The death of Manderley is the real tragedy
of the novel, as a place untouched by the demands of capital, a site of feudal
freedom, which like Rebecca herself could at least operate outside of an
encroaching bourgeois hegemony of social and sexual values."

"What romance fiction tries to offer is a triumph over the unconscious, over
the resistance to identity which lies at the very heart of psychic life.
Romance fiction makes heterosexuality easy by suspending history in its
formulae and by offering women readers a resolution in which submission and
repression are not just managed without pain or humiliation but managed at
all. Romance uses unequal heterosexuality as a dream of equality and gives
women uncomplicated access to a subjectivity which is unified and coherent and
still operating within the field of pleasure."

"That women read romance fiction is a measure of their deep dissatisfaction
with heterosexual options as of any desire to be fully identified with the
submissive versions of femininity the texts endorse. Romance imagines peace,
security, and ease precisely because there is dissension, insecurity, and
difficulty. In the context of women's lives, romance reading might appear less
a reactionary reflex or an indication of their victimization by the capitalist
market, and more a sign of discontent and a technique for survival."

_WILD SARGASSO SEA_ notes:

"When I read _Jane Eyre_ as a child, I thought, why should she think Creole
women are lunatics and all that? What a shame to make Rochester's first wife,
Bertha, the awful madwoman, and I immediately thought I'd write the story as
it might really have been. She seemed such a poor ghost. I thought I'd try to
write her a life. Charlotte Bronte must have had strong feelings about the
West Indies because she brings the West Indies into a lot of her books, like
_Villette_. Of course, one upon a time, the West Indies were very rich, and
very much more talked about than they are now." --- Jean Rhys

from Nancy Harrison, _Jean Rhys and the Novel as Women's Text_ :

"Rhys' novel poses and answers the question that Judith Gardiner construes as
central to feminist criticism: 'Who is there when a woman says 'I am'?" In
considering Rochester's narrative we can ask a similar question: 'Who is there
when a man says 'I am'?" How a person tells his or her story can itself
provide an answer to the question as it is made historically possible. Rhys
chose the first-person point of view and the narrative mode to show how
answers to these questions are revealed and to emphasize the difference, as
well as the relationship, between the man's text and the woman's. In the
interweaving of the narrative strategies of each, Rhys not only demonstrates
the predominant patterna of the woman's dream text but also further emphasizes
the importance of our reading of ourselves and others on which the difference
between the two texts turns." (194)

Jan Curtis, "The Secret of _Wide Sargasso Sea_ " _Critique_ 31 (1990):

"Antoinette's death is neither absolute triumph nor absolute failure. Rather,
the image of death in her final dream mixes the 'twin fantasy of death-in-life
and life-in-death,' the smell of dead flowers and the fresh living smell, the
buried but flowering soul, the prayer for death and the blessed attributes,
and the immortal passion that draws the moth to the candle flame. Here is the
secret. When Antoinette awakens from her final dream, her strength guides her
along the dark passageway, and she knows in the moment of epiphany that no one
on earth can truly understand the fortune of love and the art of victory over
death without mixing blind joy and sadness and the sense of being lost with
the nearness of being found." (195)

Anthony Luengo, " _Wide Sargasso Sea_ and the Gothic Mode," _World Literature
Written in English_ 15 (1976):

"The dense tropical forest which symbolizes the increasing gloom and confusion
of Rochester's mind should be seen as a latter-day descendent of the many dark
woods that appear in the gothic novels of the late 18th century" (232)

Ken Ramchand, _The West Indian Novel and its Background_ :

_WSS_ is a confirmation of Fanon's view of the terror produced in the minds of
resident colonizers during the process of de-colonization.







Leslie Fiedler defines the American Gothic as dealing "with the exaggerated
and the grotesque, not as they are verifiable in any external landscape of
sociological observation of manners and men, but as they correspond in quality
to our deepest fears and guilts as projected in our dreams or lived through in
'extreme situations.'"

Maria Olaussen, "Rhys's Construction of Blackness as Escape from White
Femininity in _WSS," Ariel_ 24 (1993):

"Rhys shows awareness of the fact that the meaning of who she is as a white
West Indian woman cannot be understood separately from the way this identity
has been constructed in the dominant Anglo-Saxon cultural context" (65)

"The theme of the novel is the fear and the possibility of losing one's
whiteness....The meaning of her sexual identity is what ultimately determines
her racial identity and vice versa."

Black critics identify the mammy, the whore, and the conjure woman as the
three stereotypical roles for the black woman and that they are based on a
fear of female sexuality and spiritual power

Elaine Showalter: "In contast to the rather vague and uncertain concepts of
insanity in general which Victorian psychiatry produced, theories of female
insanity were specifically and confidentially linked to the biological crises
of the female life cycle--puberty, pregnancy, childbirth, menopause--during
which the mind would be weakened and the symptoms of insanity might emerge."

"Rhys thus invites a comparison between Antoinette's situation and that of the
slaves. Antoinette is captured, sold, given a new name, transported across the
sea, and locked up." "Antoinette's use of black strategies of resistance
reinforces the meaning of blackness as freedom. In exploring the construction
of a particular white female identity, Rhys denies the existence of systematic
oppression of black women. They, in turn, become prisoners of another's desire
as the white Creole madwoman is set free" (81).

"The People Could Fly" an African legend that states that some slaves knew how
to fly in Africa but had to shed their wings on the slave ships. They were
able to fly away to freedom when the situation in the fields became
unbearable. Rhys uses the same story when Antoinette, like the burning parrot,
jumps down from the walls of Thornfield, flying away to freedom in her death.





NOTES ON _LINDEN HILLS_ :

"Willa Prescott Nedeed's slow recognition that her grievous plight is itself a
repetition leads her to recollect and to give voice to other women from the
past. Only then can she begin to work through her own trauma. Willa is the
fourth Mrs. Luther Needed. Each Luther finds a light-skinned wife and then,
through arcane rituals, produces a dark-skinned son, also named Luther, who
looks exactly like every other Luther. The Luthers precisely control and
replicate their own and the other families that populate Linden Hills through
each generation: the power of birth, marriage, mortgages ( they own all of the
houses), and death itself (they are all undertakers) is theirs."

"Willie and Willa are doubles to some extent."

The line of Mrs. Neededs:

Luwana Packerville (1837)

Eve;um Cretpm (1892)

Prisilla McGuire (1930s)

"The four women try to achieve recognition of their identity through the
traditional sexual strategies romance suggests. Evelyn begins to mix
aphrodisiacs; Priscilla's lively eyes seek the Luther who moves away from her
in photographs"

"Willa wants to deny the knowledge that her undertaker husband is a bizarrely
ritualistic necrophile"

"In plots that resist Gothic conventions, such as that of _Linden Hills_ , the
emphasis shifts radically by the novel's end to the protagonist finding that
she and her motives are the mystery: what she will do about her constraints,
and to what extent she may have enabled them. Willa can only begin to
understand what has happened to her when she accepts the narratives of the
women who have preceded her. As she traces Bibles, recipe books, and photo
albums, she is forced through repetition to relinquish the ideology of
marriage and the shame of thinking her plight unique. What she finds is a
community of suffering and shared experience; her recollection affirms the
reality of all of their pain. Finally, Willa's own partial working through
suggests a systemic critique of the Gothic structures that confine women."

"The novel's somber close suggests that the fall of one Gothic house is not
the end of Gothic barbarity but that it is perhaps the aggressive first step
to a freedom where no woman has to give her life to have her story told and
heard."

ENGLISH 186: FEMALE GOTHIC FICTION

TAKE-HOME FINAL EXAMINATION

DUE: May 8--no later than noon--in my office in Coughlin 247



PART I: Answer either question one or two:

1\. _Mistress of Mellyn_ exploits several gothic conventions we have seen in
its source, _Jane Eyre_. Identify those conventions, discuss how they are
altered or "modernized" in _Mistress_ , and draw some conclusions about
"supermarket gothics." How and why do they appeal to such a wide range of
readers today?

2\. _Wide Sargasso Sea_ also has _Jane Eyre_ as its source. Discuss how Rhys
has adapted Bronte's novel and how she has changed the character of Bertha--as
well as the entire Caribbean setting--to speak to a more race conscious
audience. Is this example of the female gothic an attack on racism or sexism
or both? How is it more self-conscious in its presentation of these themes
than was _Jane Eyre_?





PART II: Answer either question three or four:

3\. _Linden Hills_ has been characterized as an example of "Black Gothic,"
along with _Beloved_ and a number of novels by Toni Morrison. Identify the
gothic conventions in _Linden Hills_ and discuss the specifically racial
aspects of those themes. In short, is there any way you can identify _Linden
Hills_ as written by an African-American woman? Is the world she creates a
specifically "black" world? Why or why not?

4\. _The Haunting of Hill House_ and _The Ballad of the Sad Cafe_ both concern
the nature of love--specifically female love--in the gothic world. Compare and
contrast the types and character of love in the two nov

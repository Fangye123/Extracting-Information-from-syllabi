**Course Description**

    The expansion of Europe is one of the dominant themes of world history over the past 500 years.  This course will examine one aspect of that story, exploration, as a historical process and as a broadly influential cultural activityu of Western civilization.  It surveys major epochs of discovery, from the Vikings to Voyager, and all of the Earth's lands and seas; and it discusses the interdependence of exploration with modern science, with the arts and literature, with the political economy of Western imperialism and colonial settlements, with environmental dislocations, and other topics.

> > > > Course Description

>>>>

>>>> This course examines the interaction between science and society by
focusing on the interrelationship between the history of American culture and
the practices, beliefs and values of science and scientists. Though the major
emphasis will be on the biological sciences, with discussion of America=s
reception of evolution, the impact of modern medicine, and the rise of
genetics, particular attention will also be paid to applied science in the
form of technology, and the course will consider some of the ethical and
social dilemmas that come with scientific and technological development.
Throughout, science will be presented in a general, conceptual way, while no
specific historical knowledge is assumed.

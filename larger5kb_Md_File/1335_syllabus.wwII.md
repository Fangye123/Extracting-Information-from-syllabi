**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
This course treats World War II in its broadest perspective. It begins by
examining the cultural, political, and social issues that led to the outbreak
of war. In also looks at the effect the war had on the home fronts throughout
the world as well as how it served as an agent of cultural, intellectual, and
social change.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**  
FOUR in-class quizzes, TWO take-home exams, one 8-10 page comparative book
review (two [comparative book reviews](bookrev.html) for graduate students).
Attendance and participation are mandatory.

**GRADING POLICY:**  
The examinations and the comparative book review (s) have the same weight in
your final grade (25 percent). The quizzes together make up 25 per cent
(graduate students DO NOT TAKE QUIZZES) of your grade. Attendance and
participation are part of your grade. Late papers drop ONE letter grade
**_PER_** **_DAY_**. More than three unexcited absences will result in the
lowering of your grade by ONE letter. "Positive" class participation in
discussion can help improve your grade. Feel free to turn in the book review
and the take-home exams early! We will have a guest lecturer. You are
responsible for the material he presents.

           HST 477 is the second term in a series of four upper-division courses on the
    American West designed for history majors.  Others may take the course, but those who
    have not had a one-year survey course in U.S. history (or it equivalent) may need to do
    additional background reading.  Freshmen must see the instructor before continuing in the
    course.
    
           Though HST 477 deals with the history of the West since the Civil War, course
    materials will emphasize the twentieth century.  Since HST 478, the next course in the
    series, deals exclusively with the Pacific Northwest, HST 477 will focus mostly on other
    sub-regions of the West.  Themes to be developed include the Native West, Hispanic
    influences and persistence, Western radicalism, society in the West, resource development
    and abuse, the federal government and the West, the urban West, and how historians and
    other writers have conceptualized the West's history.  
    
           In addition to providing a survey of the history of the American West before the end
    of the Civil War, the goals of HST 477 are to:
    
           1. Build the intellectual capacities of students by encouraging critical thinking and
           analysis, thereby making them more fit for whatever career or life they may choose.
    
           2. Improve student abilities to search for and find valid sources of information and
           knowledge through both printed (library) and electronic (Internet) media.
    
           3. Improve the writing skills of students by offering them opportunities to write and
           receive professional feedback on what they have written.
    
           4. Acquaint students (especially younger students) with the standards and expectations
           of the professional world.
    
    
    
    Course Materials.  Sources for this course include lectures, discussions, a collection of
    documents and interpretive essays, two other course books, and a monographic book of each
    student's choosing.
    
    Available at the SOU bookstore are:

           In addition to these assigned materials, you may find the following library reference
    works useful:

                 (1977)

           Dictionary of American Biography (30 Vols.)
    
           The National Atlas (1973)
    
    See also materials and sources available by way of the World Wide Web on the professor's
    "home page."  Students unacquainted with the use of Internet resources should see the
    professor.
    
    
    Attendance at Lectures.  Since lectures and discussion sessions will not simply duplicate
    other materials, attendance at each lecture is vitally important and mandatory.  A roll sheet
    will be sent around each day for your signature.  Your attendance record will be used to
    make borderline grading decisions.  If you must miss a lecture, make sure you ask another
    student for copies of his or her notes.  The professor's notes are not available for copying.
    Lectures begin promptly as scheduled.  The professor uses the campus chimes to set his
    watch, and he actively discourages the rudeness and sloth of arriving late.  He will try to end
    his lectures a minute or two before the scheduled end of the period.  Students are invited to
    remind him of the time if needed, but in any case he insists that all preparations for
    departure (gathering up book bags, etc.) wait until he is finished speaking.
    
    
    Monographic and Interpretive Essay.  In consultation with the professor, each student will
    select and read one substantive monographic book from the "Further Readings" sections at
    the end of each chapter in the Milner book.  With all materials at his or her disposal as
    additional sources, each student will write a 2,500 word interpretive review essay on the
    book selected.  
    
    The professor will explain in detail just what an "interpretive review essay" is, and he will
    distribute detailed instructions on how the essay is to be prepared.  All papers should be
    typed or word processed, double spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides.  All papers
    must be thoroughly spell- and type-checked.  Papers with more than three spelling or
    typographical errors will be returned, ungraded, for correction.  
    
    Essays are due on Tuesday, March 4th by 5:00p.
    
    
    Examinations.  There will be one in-class bluebook midterm examination on February
    13th.  The final examination will a take-home format.  Unlike an in-class essay exam,
    students will be expected to submit carefully-crafted and thoughtful prose writing.  Part of
    the final will be comprehensive.  Exam questions will be distributed Thursday, March 13th
    and the completed essays will be due Wednesday, March 19th by 5:00p.
    
    
    Grading:  Final letter grades will be computed based on the following:
    
           Midterm Exam              100 pts
           Interpretive Essay        200 
           Discussions               100
           Final Exam                200
                                     _____
                                     600 pts
    
    Improvement demonstrated throughout the term will be strongly considered in determining
    final letter grade.  Grades will also be based on the meaning of those letters as indicated in
    the Winter Term Class Schedule:
    
           A = Exceptional accomplishment
           B = Superior 
           C = Average 
           D = Inferior
           F = Failed 
    
    Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading.  Please understand that high
    grades are earned not given.  You build you grade from the bottom up rather than being
    "marked off" from the top down.  A student's "usual" grades in other courses have no
    bearing on his or her grades in this course.  Likewise, grades one student receives have no
    bearing on grades assigned to another.
    
    No grade better than a "B" will be given for work that does not represent exceptional
    scholarly achievement.
    
    Students do not have the option of failing to complete a course assignment as outlined in this
    syllabus for a lesser grade.  All assignments and examinations must be completed before a
    grade will be submitted to the registrar at the end of the term.  An "I" grade will be
    submitted only after consultation with the professor and the completion of a written
    agreement on what is to be done to fulfill remaining course requirements.  In lieu if such an
    agreement, a grade of "X" ("no basis for grade") will be submitted.
    
    Students are advised that though the professor takes grades very seriously, he nevertheless
    considers them to be of little importance compared to learning and thinking about the history,
    culture, and civilizations of the American West.   
    
    Office Hours: Office hour times are listed at the top of the first page of this syllabus.  If you
    cannot meet during posted times, see the professor for an appointment.  Please note that the
    professor will not answer his office phone during posted hours so as not to interrupt students
    who have come for a conference or tutorial.  If you must phone during those times, please
    leave a message on the answering system.
    
    
    Other Items of Note:  
    
           1. Lectures and other course meetings are open only to students who are properly
           registered in HST 477.  It is the responsibility of each student to verify such
           registration.  No unregistered person will be allowed to attend lectures or other course
           meetings without the written consent of the professor.
    
           2. Lectures are provided for instructional purposes only and remain the intellectual
           property of the professor.  Other uses are prohibited.  Lecture material is covered by
           copyright (Title 17 U.S. Code).  
    
           3. Lectures and other course meetings may not be tape recorded without the
           professor's written consent.  
    
           4. Students are expected to adhere to all the rules and regulations of Southern Oregon
           State College regarding conduct and academic honesty.  See Student Handbook and
           Winter Term Schedule. 
    
           5. Students must take care to avoid plagiarism (copying the words or ideas of others
           without giving proper credit to make them seem as if they are one's own).  The best
           way to avoid plagiarism is to put everything in your own words.  You may quote
           others, but you must surround their words with quote marks (or set them off in
           indented blocks), and you must indicate the source of the quote.  Quotes should be
           short, and they should be of such a character that rephrasing in one's own words
           would do injustice to the sense, significance, or impact of the projected quote. 
           Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and will not be tolerated.

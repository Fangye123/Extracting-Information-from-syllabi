This course is one of a planned series covering certain regional areas of the
world. We will cover four primary concentrations in East Asia: China, Japan,
Korea, and the overseas operations of firms from these countries; and the
overseas Chinese. We will explore management systems (e.g. the Keiretsu and
Chaebol): consumer behavior; joint ventures/strategic alliances; and to some
extent the business-government relationship for both native and foreign firms.
We will also survey firm-level issues resulting from government trade
disputes.

** **

**Readings:**

Min Chen, _Asian Management Systems_ (Routledge, 1995) will be used as well as
supplementary readings.

**Expectations:**

The course will be primarily discussion. Each student will make presentations.
In addition, you will have written assignments. You will be expected to read
the material before class and engage in discussion of the issues presented.

Prior to the start of class, it would useful for you to familiarize yourself
somewhat with Asia. One of the best ways is to read a book (even a novel!). It
need not be about business. In fact if you haven't already read at least one
book about Asia,don't read about business matters. Examples (there are many
more):

  1. Chie Nakane, _Japanese Society_
  2. Bonovia, _The Chinese: A Portrait_
  3. Sun Tzu, _The Art of War_ (First read the book.Then see the movie "Wall Street", which I understand is based on Sun Tzu's principles). 
  4. Confucius, T _he Analects_
  5. Unknown, _Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance_
  6. Alan Watts, _Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind_ , or Watts, _The Way of Zen_
  7. Any of the four classics of Chinese Literature: _Dream of the Red Chamber_ ; _Monkey_ ; _Water Margin_ ; Golden Lotus 
  8. Lao Tzu, Tao Te Ching 
  9. Reischauer, _Japan: The Story of a Nation_
  10. Lin Yu-tang, _The Wisdom of China and India_
  11. Unknown, _Love, Sex and Marriage in Contemporary Japan_
  12. Feng Yu-lan, A _Short History of Chinese Philosophy_
  13. Any of the novels by Japanese author Yukio Mishima (e.g. _Spring Snow_ ). 
  14. Seki, _Botchan_
  15. Musashi, _Book of the Five Rings_ 

** **

**Keeping up with East Asia:**

The usual sources (WSJ, NYT, _Newsweek_ , _Business Week_ , _Forbes_ ,
_Fortune_ ) are not good sources for news and opinion on Asia. Better sources
are:

  1. _The Financial Times_ (London) 
  2. _Far Eastern Economic Review_
  3. _China News Digest_ (Internet) 
  4. _Asian Wall Street Journal_ 

Also note that each government has public relations "factories" which
constantly spill out information on that country: some is official government
policy, some is quasi-official. There are other agencies in each country which
are quasi-official and make similar material available. Examples from Japan:
_Japan Update_ , _Kiedanren Review_ , _KKC Forum_.

**Areas not studied:**

I also urge you to read at least two articles this summer about the Asian
civilizations we will not explore in any depth: Thailand, Burma, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Vietnam, etc. in Southeast Asia; in South Asia, India, Pakistan,
Nepal; in Central Asia, Tibet, Mongolia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Kyrgystan,
Kazakhstan, Turkey, etc.

**ASSIGNMENTS**

(25%) As a group project, you will write me a book outline. The "title" of the
book might be "America's Permanent Trade War With Asia". This is not to be a
text, but the sort of book one might find in a university library. The group
assignment is to write the outline for all chapters, and each will receive the
same grade for this portion of the assignments.

(50%) As an individual project, you are to write one chapter of the book. A
book chapter is usually 30 typewritten pages. You will receive an individual
grade based on this chapter.

(25%) I would also like a short paper (up to 15 pages) on an aspect of the
material we are studying. For example, a paper on strategic alliances,
summarizing the literature and advancing propositions for further research
would be useful.

(25%) You will each do one short presentation (about 15 minutes) per week on
the material covered.

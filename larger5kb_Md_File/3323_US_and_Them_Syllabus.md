**Description:** What does our country look like from beyond our borders?
How do our American experiences and values influence the way we see other
countries, ethnicities, and nationalities?  In this course, we will explore
the dialogues, monologues and frequent conflicts between the American way of
thinking and seeing, and other ways from other lands.  Through literature,
film, comics, travel writing, reporting, and other media, we will discover
exactly what it means to stand in an American's shoes looking out and
experience (perhaps for the first time) what it's like to be in someone else's
shoes looking in.  We will crisscross the boundaries of our land, assembling a
collage of varied experiences, in order to get to know America better, inside
and out.  


**Objectives:**

  * To step outside our site - our culture and upbringing - and see it from other points of view
  * To learn some of the history of cultural interactions between the United States and other nations and regions
  * To apply a transcultural analytic perspective to current international interactions
  * To read with understanding in a variety of genres
  * To acquire communication skills in written and spoken presentations
  * To explore the implications of global cultural exchange and movement for the future



**Texts:**

Rob Kroes, _If You 've Seen One, You've Seen the Mall: Europeans and American
Mass Culture_ (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1996)

Foreign Culture_ , 3rd edition (Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Publishing, 2001)

  


**Requirements:**

  1. **Attendance.** More than four excused absences will affect your grade; more than two unexcused absences will affect your grade.
  2. **Participation.** Our pursuit of ideas and answers is a group effort, and we will need everyone to listen, question, respond, and lead.
  3. **Listserv participation.** Before each class period you must post a response to the previous class 's topic on the class e-mail listserv. This activity takes the place of the journal entries to which you are accustomed. Your writing, instead of disappearing into the black hole of your instructor's office, will be sent to every other member of the class. All students, in turn, may reply to your e-mail with their own comments, answers to questions you've raised, agreements or disagreements, or any pertinent response - and all those replies will also be sent to the entire class. Posts are due at class time. On most class days, you will be given a topic or question to write about before the next class period.

_The required weekly post is just the beginning of listserv participation.
You are encouraged to use the listserv to pose questions, give answers to
others, and generally ruminate on any topic related to the class.  It's a way
to "keep the conversation going" outside of class time, and a way for you to
help each other through some difficult but important ideas.  The website for
the listserv (general information, subscription options, archives) is
_<http://l2.uca.edu/mailman/listinfo/usandthem> **.   **_Send your postings to
_[usandthem@l2.uca.edu](mailto:usandthem@l2.uca.edu) _(that 's an L before the
2).  For further guidelines, see "[Using the Class
Listserv](http://faculty.uca.edu/~donnab/syllabi/UsandThemDocuments/Listservintro.htm)."_

  4. **Projects.** Three projects, two individual and one group, will make up the largest part of your grade. The first, due **September 18** , will be an ["ethnic autobiography."](http://faculty.uca.edu/~donnab/syllabi/UsandThemDocuments/Project1.html) The second, due **October 23** , will be [an interview of a person from another culture.](http://faculty.uca.edu/~donnab/syllabi/UsandThemDocuments/Project2.html) The third, due **November 29-December 6** , will be a group presentation based on your exploration of one of Central Arkansas's subcultures.
  5. **Final exam**. The exam will be a choice of essay questions designed to allow you to integrate information from various sections of the course.

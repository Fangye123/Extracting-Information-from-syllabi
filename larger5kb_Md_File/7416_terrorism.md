**THE WAR FROM THE WEB: READING FOR RHETORIC IN SEPTEMBER 11 DOCUMENTS ON THE
INTERNET**  
Winter 2002  
Elizabeth Losh  
[lizlosh@uci.edu](mailto:lizlosh@uci.edu)  
---  
This course will focus on **close-reading of primary texts** from the past few
months for rhetorical features, but will also include some other very short
readings about the history of
[rhetoric](http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/silva.htm) for background.

Be warned.  Some of these documents about September 11 will contain **powerful
emotional and ideological material**.   Nonetheless, students from the widest
possible range of backgrounds and perspectives are encouraged to enroll in
this course, so that members of the group can also educate each other.

This seminar will emphasize the **strategies of a variety of rhetorical
appeals** rather than validate any one particular political viewpoint.   For
example, what are broadly labeled "appeals to _logos_ " in the syllabus below
would not necessarily be _better_ or _more logical_ than other documents _,_
and we would read all effective texts for the multiple rhetorical strategies
that they deploy.

Writing assignments that might grow out of class discussion would involve
**electronic discourse** : e-mail postings to our electronic discussion list
and a class web page project.  For your convenience, almost all the September
11 documents that we will be reading are available online through the
hypertext syllabus below.  In our educational use of this intellectual
property, links go to sources with a hosting news or governmental agency
whenever possible.  Please refer to the special UCI edition of _Writing from A
to Z_ to learn how to appropriately acknowledge an Internet source.

Note: 1) You will be expected to subscribe to the online version of the _New
York Times_ at [www.nytimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com) to read some of the
assigned material.  2) You should also _print out web pages_ and take notes in
the margins of the hard copy and plan to bring your annotated documents to
class.   If you do not own a printer and computer, there are several computer
labs on-campus that offer low-cost printing services with a UCI print card.
3) Optional readings to supplement class discussion are indicated by
parentheses in the syllabus below.   Nevertheless, you may find it helpful to
skim this material before class.

DOCUMENTS CHOSEN BY THE CLASS  

* * *

Although many of the "classic texts" on rhetoric were written a long time ago,
we will apply ideas from [stasis
theory](http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/gallery/rhetoric/terms/stasis.html),
[Isocrates](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Isoc.+13+1),
[Plato](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Plat.+Gorg.+447a),
[Aristotle](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-
bin/ptext?lookup=Aristot.+Rh.+1354a),
[Cicero](http://www.utexas.edu/depts/classics/documents/Cic.html),
[Quintilian](http://www.msu.edu/user/lewisbr4/980/quintilian.html), and
[Kenneth
Burke](http://www.sla.purdue.edu/people/engl/dblakesley/burke/default.html) to
the documents of the immediate present.

We will start by studying what the Aristotle called **_ethos_** (the
credibility or "character" of a speaker), **_logos_** (the logical structure
of the speaker's argument), and **_pathos_** (the way that emotional appeals
are used by a speaker to persuade an audience).

Rhetoric, however, should not be considered only as a history of "Western"
discourse.  [Islamic
philosophers](http://www.trincoll.edu/depts/phil/philo/phils/muslim/) were
also important in the history of rhetoric.  In fact, the text of Aristotle's
_Rhetoric,_ parts of which we will be reading in this class, survived to the
present day because it was preserved by Arab scholars and commentators.

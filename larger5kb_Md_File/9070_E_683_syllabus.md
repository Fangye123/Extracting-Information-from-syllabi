_THIS COURSE WILL BE OFFERED IN WINTER 2003!_  

Until then, I warmly recommend Mark Rosenfelder's excellent article on the
[basic properties of Chinese
characters](http://zompist.com/yingzi/yingzi.htm).

**1\. Overview**  

This interdisciplinary course is a critical response to well-known claims made
about the uniqueness of Chinese characters. It investigates the extent to
which these claims have had an impact on linguistics, literary criticism, and
other scholarly disciplines in both the past and present. It also highlights,
through a detailed examination of the workings of the Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean writing systems, the flaws of these claims; relevant experimental data
from psycholinguistics are introduced, and the practical research implications
of these data are pursued.  

This course is aimed at students in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Linguistics,
Comparative Studies, and disciplines in which semiology is central issue (e.g.
philosophy). Because of the heterogeneous background of students taking the
course, it will be sufficiently general to accommodate undergraduates
approaching graduation but demanding enough for graduate students.  

The course will consist of lectures and discussions that either clarify the
operation of writing systems, both in general and in East Asia, or deal with
the claims of uniqueness referred to above. Students will read additional
materials, which will be the basis for a mid-term exam and final paper of
approximately 10 to 15 pages on a research topic chosen in consultation with
the instructor. Grades will be determined by class participation (40%), the
mid-term (25%), and final paper (35%).  
  

**2\. Syllabus**  

_Weeks 1-3: Introducing Chinese Characters_  

During the first three (3) weeks, students are expected to read John DeFrancis
1984 and 1989.  In class, the instructor will provide introductory lectures
and then lead discussions based on the readings. Why is the notion of Chinese
characters as ideograms so alluring? Sampson 1985, Logan 1986, Fenollosa 1986,
Taylor & Taylor 1995, and Hannas 1997 (all on reserve) are examples of books
in which scholars go astray. Eco 1995 provides important background history on
this confusion.  

_Weeks 4-5: How are characters used to write East Asian languages?_  

Daniels & Bright 1996 provide general information, with supporting material in
Kim-Reynaud 1997 for Korean, DeFrancis 1977 and Hannas 1997 for Vietnamese,
and Unger 1987, 1996 for Japanese. Packard 2000 presents a cogent linguistic
argument that, although Chinese tend to speak of characters rather than words,
Chinese has words (often longer than one syllable) just like other languages.  

Students will have proposed final assignment topics by the end of Week 5, and
there will be a mid-term examination.  

_Week 6-7: Psycholinguistics of Reading and Writing_  

How do Chinese characters function at the psychological level?  Paradis,
Hagiwara & Hildebrandt 1985 and Kess & Miyamoto 1999 provide the background to
the experimental and clinical literature.  The important dissertations of
Horodeck 1987 and Matsunaga 1994 are examined in detail.  (See also
Matsunaga's chapter in Erbaugh 2002.)  Sproat 2000 shows how one scholar has
made use of Horodeck and Matsunaga's work, and situates East Asian writing
within the larger context of handling all writing systems on computers.  

_Week 8-10: Implications for Cognitive Science and Social History_  

Belief in the ideographicity of Chinese characters as used in Japanese writing
is in some ways even stronger than in the case of Chinese, and so deserves
special attention. Seeley 1991, Twine 1991, Gottlieb 1995, and Unger 1996
discuss the political aspects of Japanese writing and script reform. Unger
1987, Lunde 1993, and Gottlieb 2000 present contrasting views on the
computerization of Japanese and other East Asian scripts. Finally, do
alternatives to the cognitivist approach to symbols and meaning (Dreyfus 1992,
Harris 1995, Harris 1996) hold the key?

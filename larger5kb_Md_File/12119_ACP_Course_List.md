**Are these courses offered all over the state in all ACP high schools?**  
No. Many high schools offer only one or two courses. Your guidance counselor
can tell you what courses are available at your high school. In addition, some
courses are numbered differently in different parts of the state, depending on
how the closest IU campus numbers the course.

#### What are the descriptions for each course?

**L100 Humans and the Biological World (5 credit hours)**  
This two-semester course is a lecture and laboratory course designed to offer
the non-major an opportunity to examine the fundamental principles of biology.
L100 introduces biological organization from molecules through cells and
organisms to populations. The emphasis is on processes common to all organisms
with special reference to humans. The course also prepares the student for
more advanced courses should the decision be made to continue in biology. L100
does not fulfill any requirements for the biology major. It does fulfill
distribution requirements for most majors. It is a required course for the
Social Work major.  
top

**C105 Principles of Chemistry (3 credit hours)  
C125 Experimental Chemistry (2 credit hours)  
** The first of a two-semester course sequence. The curriculum includes topics
such as energy and the nucleus, nuclear chemistry, atomic and molecular
bonding, gases, solids, acids and bases, and thermodynamics. The two courses
are concurrent, C125 being the laboratory component. Prerequisites on the
Bloomington campus are two years of high school algebra and one year of high
school chemistry. ACP strongly recommends that prospective students have a
math SAT of at least 570.  
top

**C106 Quantitative Chemistry (3 credit hours)  
C126 Experimental Chemistry II (2 credit hours)  
** The second of a two-semester sequence. The curriculum includes chemical
equilibrium, kinetics, and acid base equilibrium, solubility, complexation,
electronchemistry, and descriptive inorganic chemistry.  
top

**C101 Elementary Chemistry (3 credit hours)  
C121 Elementary Chemistry Laboratory I (2 credit hours)  
** These two courses are taught concurrently, but it is possible for a student
to enroll in only the lecture course, C101. The course is an examination of
the fundamental aspects of inorganic and physical chemistry with an
introduction to organic chemistry. Among the topics covered are theories of
atomic and molecular structure; reactions of acids, bases, and ionic solutes;
chemistry of hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen, halogens, and metals;
radiation; and the structure and reactions of hydrocarbons. The lab is an
introduction to the techniques and reasoning of experimental chemistry.
C101/C121 are available for credit second semester, so students who are in an
ACP C105/C125 or an advanced chemistry section taught by an ACP teacher but
who elected not to take the class for college credit first semester, have the
option to enroll in C101/C121 second semester. As with C105/C125,
prerequisites include two years of high school algebra and a strong
performance in one year of high school chemistry. ACP strongly recommends that
prospective students have a math SAT of at least 500.  
top

**E201 Introduction to Microeconomics (3 credit hours)  
** The course focuses on microeconomics only. The syllabus covers societal
applications of core analytical concepts such as: scarcity, opportunity cost,
competitive and noncompetitive market pricing, and interdependence. Students
then apply these concepts to a number of current economic policy problems,
such as: poverty, pollution, excise taxes, rent controls, and farm subsidies.
This is economics on a high academic level.  
top

**A202 Literary Interpretation (3 credit hours)  
** The course emphasizes a close, thoughtful reading of representative
literary texts (poetry, drama, fiction, or non-fiction prose) originally
written in English and drawn from a range of historical periods and countries.
A major goal is to develop the ability to read and write with precision,
responsibility, and imagination through class discussion and the writing of
several short, critical responses. Close reading of a few selected texts,
rather than wide coverage, is encouraged. Prerequisites are three years of
high school English. It is preferred that students have W131 prior to L202.  
top

**W131 Elementary Composition (3 credit hours)  
** The course prepares students for writing in a variety of college courses.
The focus of the course is on writing from multiple sources to analyze an
issue and argue a position. Skills include evaluating sources of information,
summarizing sources, adopting a thoughtful position, advancing a clear thesis,
and supporting one's views with evidence. Prerequisites are three years of
high school English.  
top

**H105/H106 American History I & II (3+3 credit hours)  
** This two-semester course covers the evolution of American society:
political, economic, social structure, racial and ethnic groups, world
diplomacy of the United States, territorial expansion, industrialization,
urbanization, international events and their impact on American history. H105
covers from English colonization through the Civil War. H106 covers 1865 to
the present. A school may offer one or both semesters. Further, these
semester-long courses can be offered within the required American history
course in either the junior or senior year if the high school section being
offered for college credit is designated as advanced or honors. Prerequisites
include two years of high school history and/or social studies.

**M118 Finite Mathematics (3 credit hours)  
** This course discusses set theory, techniques of counting, probability,
linear systems, matrices, and linear programming. M118 also includes
applications to business and the social sciences. Prerequisites: Two years of
high school algebra; skill with solving word problems is required; students
should also be able to work accurately with fractions and decimals, to graph
linear equations, and to solve two linear equations in two unknowns.  
top

**M119 Brief Survey of Calculus I (3 credit hours)  
** The course presents an overview of basic concepts in calculus. M119 is an
introduction to calculus designed primarily for students in business and the
social sciences. Prerequisites include a strong background in high school
geometry and algebra.  
top

**M211 Calculus I (4 credit hours)  
** Offered at school registering through IU Bloomington and IU Kokomo only.

The course prerequisites for M211, M212, M215, and M216 include a strong
performance in three years of high school mathematics, such as: algebra,
advanced algebra, geometry, or trigonometry. Further, students need to have a
high interest in mathematics generally.  
NOTE: All ACP mathematics courses include a diagnostic test given prior to the
due date for student applications. This is the same test given at IU
Bloomington for counseling students into the appropriate mathematics course.
Based on the results of the diagnostic test, students are advised to apply or
not for college credit in the ACP course.

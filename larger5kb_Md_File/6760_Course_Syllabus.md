and social relationships making American history from colonization to
reconstruction.  General Education.  3 credit hours.

* * *

  
**I. Overview and Course Goals:**  
Welcome to American History to 1877 (HIST 121) online.   The study of early
American history is the study of the national past.  In the deepest and
broadest sense, it is the study of the ways in which present ways of living
and thinking have developed from historical circumstances and situations.  It
seeks to describe and to analyze politics, culture, and society to the degree
that the record of evidence will allow.  It considers the vital facts of
historical matters, which make citizens both wiser in public choices and more
conscious of their private lives.  It accentuates the power of human
motivation, of those institutions constituted to advance civilization, and of
those patterns of habit and thought that resonate with the American
experience.

**During Week One:**   We begin with an introduction to the first peoples to
populate North America, the American Indians.  In addition to becoming
familiar with the online environment, we explore the meetings of diverse
cultures in the wake of European conquest.  We consider both the triumph and
the tragedy of these first encounters.  While noting the controversies that
continue over Columbus's place in history, we focus upon the impact of Spanish
imperialism upon population, religion, agriculture, and borders in the New
World.

**During Week Two:**   We examine the English transplantations laying the
foundations for provincial America during the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries.  Despite a late start in the race for empire, England joined in the
conquest of North America during a period of rapid expansion and settlement.
Although varying in purpose and in design, we discern that each of the
thirteen colonies demonstrated patterns of race relations and social hierarchy
shaping the developing institutions of the English provinces.

**During Week Three:  ** We explore the British Empire during a time of
crisis.  We consider the American revolution and its significance.  As part of
their worldwide struggle for power during the eighteenth century, Great
Britain and France engaged in almost continuous warfare for control of North
American colonies.  We consider the eruption of a colonial rebellion within
the larger context of that world war, wherein the Americans gradually moved
from asserting their rights as Englishmen to fighting a war against the
British empire.

**During Week Four:**   We explore the new republic established in 1789 and
national security in the Jeffersonian era.  The innovative government of the
United States faced considerable difficulties, especially since traditional
political theory suggested that large-scale republics were doomed to fall
apart because of instability and factional conflict.  We underscore the roles
of the Federalists and the Republicans in these years of partisan division,
which culminated in a bitter war in 1812 against Native Americans and Great
Britain.

**During Week Five:**   We begin a new phase of American history known as the
antebellum period.  As we continue to experience the online environment, we
explore the varieties of nationalism and the power of Jacksonian democracy.  A
new sense of national confidence appeared in economics, law, and foreign
policy, but it would not mitigate against the passions arising from the
sectional orientations of Northerners and Southerners.  Nevertheless, we
recognize that the rise of Andrew Jackson to the presidency revitalized
partisan politics and reinforced a growing faith in the spirit of the common
man.

**During Week Six:**   We examine the economic revolutions of the early
republic and the peculiar institutions of the cotton kingdom.  We observe the
mutual and interdependent development of the factory system and plantation
agriculture, which greatly exacerbated the differences between the sections.
While the Northern economy developed the characteristics of industrialization
and wage labor, the Southern economy reinforced a complex social order
exploiting the labor of black chattel slaves.

**During Week Seven:**   We explore the social movements of antebellum
reformers and the impending crisis for the Union.  The age of reforms affected
nearly all areas of American life and culture, especially education,
literature, religion, and government.  We consider a series of sectional
controversies erupting during the 1850s, which inspired the creation of a
radical abolitionist movement in the North committed to ending the oppression
of slavery and to destroying the power of the planter elite.

**During Week Eight:**   We explore the Civil War and the reconstruction of
the New South.  We examine Abraham Lincoln's leadership to prevent the
secession of Southern states while identifying the reasons for the defeat of
the Confederacy in the key battlefields of the war.  What began as a struggle
over the fate of the Union eventually became a total war to end slavery and a
political crusade to extend civil rights to freedmen.  We consider the
policies of the federal government that failed disastrously to overcome the
legacies of racial and sectional divisions.

readings, and activities.

**II. Course Objectives:**  
This course introduces students to the significant people, places, and events
of American history to 1877.   It is intended to provide students a virtual
classroom experience to develop an understanding of history and to demonstrate
that understanding in challenging work appropriate to a general education
course.  Because this course has been designated as one of the introductory
studies for general education, it bears a distinctive responsibility for
teaching foundational knowledge.  It explicitly includes a significant writing
and communications component, thus embodying the ideal that these skills are
an integral and indivisible part of academic and intellectual endeavors.  In
addition, it embraces material from other disciplines, thereby transcending
disciplinary limits and emphasizing the interconnectedness of knowledge in an
academic community.  Furthermore, it fosters a sense of the power of diversity
and cultural pluralism.  Finally, it stresses the meaning, use, and value of
critical thinking.  In this course, each student will:  
1\. recognize significant people, places, and events in America before 1877;  
2\. describe the connections between politics, culture, and society;  
3\. analyze patterns of change and continuity in the human past;  
4\. evaluate primary sources within an appropriate context;  
5\. develop historical literacy by reading the assigned texts.

**III. Course Policies:**  
View the Student Orientation Guide at
<http://www.ccis.edu/departments/distanceeducation/definal/index.htm> for
details about taking an online course.   The professor reserves the right to
manage a positive learning environment and thus will not tolerate
inappropriate conduct in this course.  There will be no discrimination on the
basis of sex, race, color, national origin, sexual orientation, religion,
ideology, political affiliation, veteran status, age, physical handicap, or
marital status.  Students with documented disabilities who may need academic
services for this course are required to register with the ADA coordinator of
Columbia College.  Read the entire syllabus before continuing in the course.
The policies and related syllabus matters remain subject to change in the
event of extenuating circumstances.



# Student Conduct

The instructor reserves the right to manage a positive learning environment
and thus will not tolerate inappropriate conduct in the course.  All Columbia
College students, whether enrolled in a land-based or on-line course, are
responsible for behaving in a manner consistent with Columbia College's Code
of Student Conduct and Ethics Code for Computer Users.  Students violating
these codes will be referred to the Campus Life Office for possible
disciplinary action.  The Code for Student Conduct and the Ethics Code for
Computer Users can be found in the Columbia College Student Handbook, a copy
of which can be obtained by calling the Campus Life office at 573-875-7425.

**On-Line Participation**  
Participation online is expected and continuous throughout the course.
Absences without leave from scheduled activities may result in a course
withdrawal issued for the student.  Emergency leaves from scheduled activities
must be documented with the professor.  Students are expected to read the
assigned texts each week.  Students are expected to log-in to the class
conferencing, view references page, and interact with the [textbook online
learning center](http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/history/usa/brink) at least
once each week.  Remember to post **at least one message per week to each of
the three threads provided in the Discussions area.**   Active participation
in the course will guide students in studying for the exams and in researching
for the scholarship.  Although the materials viewed online may be printed or
copied for personal use, remember that active notetaking and transcription
enhance information retention.  The professor will facilitate online
discussions in the conference room by responding to posted messages.  Messages
posted weekly should resonate with these three threads:

  * Information viewed at the [textbook online learning center](http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/history/usa/brink), which includes chapter objectives, main themes, glossary, self-assessment, interactive maps, web links, and power-point lectures; 
  * Essential questions for each week; 
  * Deep thoughts for discussion based upon chapter readings.

A class week is defined as the period of time between Monday and Sunday.  The
first week begins the first day of the semester and ends midnight the
following Sunday.  The last week of the course will end on Friday.  Weekly
materials will be posted by the professor between Sunday and Monday.  Keep in
mind that digital data and email contains date and time stampings that can not
be altered.  Without significant activity online, students will not succeed on
the exams or with the scholarship.

**Ground Rules for On-line Participation**  
While navigating the on-line environment, observe the ground-rules at all
times:

  1. Students should use email for private messages to the professor and to other students.  The Class Conference is for public messages only.
  2. Students are expected to invest time each week conferencing or other appropriate online activities, including but not limited to sending/receiving email and navigating and conducting research over the World Wide Web.
  3. All students will participate in conference discussion.  Conventions of "online etiquette," which include courtesy to all users, will be observed.
  4. Students may not expect the professor to assist with computer-related problems.
  5. Students will normally submit papers as attached files uploaded to the computer and routed to the instructor by email.  Assigned papers may be submitted via the postal service or fax only if arrangements are made with the instructor beforehand.

**Academic Honesty**  
All Columbia College policies are in effect as described in the Academic
Dishonesty/Misconduct section of the current college Catalog.  

Collaboration is not permitted in this course.  A student's grade will be
based in large part on the originality of ideas and written presentation of
these ideas.  Students working unethically will earn no points toward the
total grade and risk further prosecution through the College disciplinary
system.  Remember that honor in academic endeavors provides the ultimate
standard by which students and professors are held accountable.

Presenting as one's own the words, ideas, or expression of another in any form
is plagiarism.  If you are unsure about what constitutes plagiarism, review
the rules of original writing at the following website:
<http://owl.english.purdue.edu/>.  To review some plagiarism tools available
to students, take a look at <http://www.schoolsucks.com> and
<http://www.evilcheater.com>.  The content of these plagiarism sites is
substandard, and plagiarists will almost always be exposed by the prevention
tools available to instructors.  Here are two sites that may be of interest:
<http://indiana.edu/~wts/wts/plagiarism.html> and <http://www.plagiarism.com>.
Plagiarism will not be tolerated, and the claim of ignorance is no excuse.
Those found plagiarizing may be dropped from the course.

**Grading Policy**  
Exams must be **proctored** under the supervision of a representative of
Columbia College.   Acceptable proctors include, but are not restricted to,
Columbia College Extended Campus Directors or their staff, ministers,
commanding officers (direct superiors are not acceptable), corporate executive
officers, and public librarians.  Personal friends and family members are not
acceptable.  In extenuating circumstances, a responsible independent authority
approved by the professor may serve as a proctor.  YOU MUST ARRANGE AN
ACCEPTABLE PROCTOR.  Whatever the case, the name, address, phone number, and
email of proctor for each student shall be filed with the professor during the
first week of the course (note the initial Conference threads on the Course
Schedule).  Exams must be completed according to the course schedule unless an
emergency leave is obtained in advance.  Late work will be assessed an
automatic 50% penalty reduction in score regardless of excuse.  Student
scholarship and exams will be kept on file for one session following the
completion of this course.

**IV. Grades:**  
Course grades will be determined by four cumulative component scores: exam1
(350pts), exam2 (350pts), online participation (200 pts), and scholarship
(100pts).   The sum of the component scores will be used to calculate the
appropriate total grade for the course.  In the case of a "borderline" total
grade for the course, the professor may consider the scholarship when
determining the balance of the scale.  The following is the scale:  
1000-900 pts.....A;  
899-800 pts.......B;  
799-700 pts.......C;  
699-600 pts.......D;  
599-0 pts.......´F.

## Course Assignments

** **

The course is based on three key components, which each student is expected to
participate.  These components are not to be viewed as separate assignments,
but rather as assignments that complement each other in order to provide a
more comprehensive historical perspective of American History.  These
components include:



            1.  Two Exams

            2.  Scholarship Paper

            3.  Class Participation ****

** **

**Exams.**   _(700 points)_ As the key components of the course, we have two
scheduled exams (note the dates on the Course Schedule).  Both of the two-hour
exams are rigorous, but neither is comprehensive.  Each exam will consist of
fifty (50) multiple choice questions earning 5 points per answer and two (2)
essay questions earning 50 points per answer.  The textbook test bank provides
multiple choice questions that the professor will utilize in selecting
multiple choice questions for the exams.  Remember that the [textbook online
learning center](http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/history/usa/brink) allows you
to practice with multiple choice questions by giving you feedback through the
self-assessment tool.  In fact, some of the same multiple choice questions in
the self-assessment tool may appear on the exams.  Furthermore, the essay
questions will be based upon a number of essential questions highlighted for
discussion each week.   These two exams are proctored exams, meaning that they
are administered by a supervisor approved by the instructor (see Grading
Policy above).

#  

**Scholarship Paper**.   _(100 points)._   In another component of the course,
we have a scholarship paper requiring each student, first, to critically
analyze primary sources and, second, to research related secondary sources
before typing the paper.  Scholarship provides each student with the
opportunity to develop research and writing skills as well as to synthesize
knowledge about an important subject.  Moreover, scholars of history not only
discuss the matters of fact but also tell their stories with skill.  To assist
in developing scholarship, utilize the references page provided with the
course.  In order to earn the 100 points for the component score, scholars
will submit a paper that:

  * Considers the controversial issue announced by the professor in the initial threads for conferencing (note the initial Conference threads on the Course Schedule).
  * Identifies at least four examples of primary sources (i.e., letters, diaries, publications) related to the issue; see Michael Johnson, _Reading the American Past_ for examples.
  * Constructs a thesis statement based upon the examples.
  * Consults a number of additional secondary sources that help to develop a thesis; see Alan Brinkley, _American History_ for suggestions.
  * Incorporates an introduction, body, and conclusion.
  * Organizes paragraphs with approximately eight sentences developing a single topic.
  * Elaborates major points with a degree of specificity.
  * Clarifies premises using coherent diction.
  * Avoids spelling errors, awkward language, improper grammar, flawed punctuation, and other technical mistakes.
  * Includes at least four pages of full typed text circumscribed by one inch margins, making each double spaced page approximately 250 words and 25-27 lines with a standard type 12 point font.
  * Uses a documentation style guide consistently and correctly; see the [Chicago Style (University of Wisconsin)](http://www.wisc.edu/writing/Handbook/DocChicago.html) for examples.
  * Adds a bibliography.
  * Meets the deadlines for drafts and revisions according to the Course Schedule.

**Class Participation.**   _(200 points)._   Another component score derives
from online participation.  Participation in all conference discussions will
improve performance on exams and may be considered holistically by the
professor.  The total possible points for participation during the session
equals 200 points, or a maximum of 25 points per week.  Student participation
online will be evaluated each week according to the following standards:

  * 20-25 points: On-line postings are on time and model answers given for all threads.  Responses are complete, concise and referenced where applicable. 
  * 15-19 points: On-line postings are late but the model answers for all threads are on time.  Responses are not model, complete, concise and referenced where applicable but are adequate.
  * 10-14 points: On-line postings are late and answers are neither model nor well developed.  Responses are below average. 
  * 1-9 points: On-line postings are late and lack either effort or content.
  * 0 points: No on-line postings.

>  
>  **Catalogue Description:  
>  ** The anchor course for Stage Two of the Ursuline Studies Program is
entitled "Introduction to Culture." It is a six credit, two-semester
interdisciplinary course. It represents the humanities and fine arts portion
of the curriculum and has as its theme "The City" as a human phenomenon. The
course traces key cities throughout history and a variety of cultural
settings: world culture, western culture, American culture, and aesthetic
response. It is a writing intensive course in which students are assisted in
the process of individual and group research in the areas dealt with in the
course.  
>  
>  **Ursuline Studies Developmental Stage Two:  
>  ** The purpose of Introduction to Culture is to assist students to move
beyond the level of received knowledge (in which knowledge is passively
accepted from those perceived to be authorities or sources of truth), through
subjective knowing (in which intuitive reaction to personal experience is the
paramount authority), toward procedural knowing (in which one's own position
is seen in relationship to a multiplicity of others). Students entering the
course will have an awareness of strands of their own culture, learned from
family and personal experience. As a result of this course, students will be
able to know and appreciate other cultures for their own contributions, value
them for both their uniqueness and their common features, and use this
culturally diverse frame of reference to rethink their own experience.

>  **Course Description:  
>  ** The focus of US351 is the city of Paris during the Enlightenment and New
York and Harlem from 1900-1939. The culminating project is a 10-15 page
research paper that focuses on a single aspect of the humanities that reflects
or shapes the culture of a particular city, for examples, a school of writers
representative of Chicago during the height of its industrial age. The student
will describe the subject matter, examine perspectives on it, add her or his
own interpretations, and place the subject matter in its proper context.
Students will team with other students focusing on the same city.  
>  
>  Students will write a variety of other short (2-3) page papers as part of
their assignments. Examples include reflection papers, letters, editorials,
and analytical essays.

culture

areas and the underlying assumptions of each:

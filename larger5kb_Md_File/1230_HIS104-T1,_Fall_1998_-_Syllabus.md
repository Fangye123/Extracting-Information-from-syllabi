#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING SCALE

Built around the videotaped lectures of Eugene Weber (from University of
California, Los Angeles), this course synthesizes various approaches to the
telling of history by focusing on political as well as social events. Each
televised broadcast of "Western Tradition I" includes two programs (one
"unit") - contact [KET](http://www.ket.org) for the broadcast schedule for
"Western Tradition I" in your area. These videotapes have been purchased by
the [L.C.C. Library](http://www.uky.edu/LCC/LIB), and are available for your
viewing at the Circulation Desk. You can watch the videotapes for the 2-hour
reserve time in the library, see the Library website (or call 257-4919) for
further [information](http://www.uky.edu/LCC/LIB/info.html).

You watch each unit after having read the Boggis _Study Guide_ and related
Kagan textbook chapters, for a total of 14 units. Your grade will be
calculated on a 100-point scale, where A = 90-100%, B = 80-89%, C = 70-79%, D
= 60-69%, E = 59% and below. Make an appointment (call 257-3635) and come
visit me (221 Moloney Building) here at
[L.C.C.](http://www.uky.edu/LCC/lccmap.gif) to talk to me in person. Since
this is a self-paced course, you will be working with me on a one-on-one
basis. You must contract with me by September 2, 1998, on how you will fulfill
the following requirements:

[![](grndot.gif) HIS104-T1 On-line Discussion Participation](../discuss.html)
(20% of your grade)  

     In this part of the course you will be expected to take part in our class discussions via the HIS104-T1 newsgroup. You will be graded on a weekly basis; and you will be expected to lead a discussion during one week (you specify in your grade contract when you wish to do this).  
[![](grndot.gif) HIS104-T1 Exams](exam.html) (60% of your grade)  

    This part of your grade will be contracted: in the first week of classes you will set the dates, the number, and relative grade weight of exams you wish to take.  
[![](grndot.gif) HIS104-T1 Written Project](project.html) (20% of your grade)  

    In your course grade contract, you will specify what research project you plan to complete by the last day of classes. You can choose any one of the projects in the _Optional Activity_ sections of each chapter in the Boggis _Study Guide_ , or you can write a Web Review of any two of the recommended sites on each Unit webpage (you must choose websites from two different themes).

#### POLICY ON WITHDRAWALS AND INCOMPLETES

You may withdraw from this class at any time during the semester. Incompletes
are given only in emergencies and only when there is a minor amount of the
course left to complete. For you to receive an "I" grade, you must submit a
written contract on how you plan to make up the work, and this contract must
be signed by me, my department chair and the Dean of Academic Affairs before
the last day of classes.

#### CHEATING/PLAGIARISM

Cheating or plagiarism will not be tolerated, and any infringement of the
L.C.C. Student Code will be dealt with swiftly and completely. The first
offence will earn a failing grade on the assignment in question; and you will
not be allowed to submit any further work without a conference with me during
which you show me a draft of your work. The second offence will deserve a more
public hearing by the Division Chair, Ombud and Judiciary Board with permanent
record being established in your student affairs file. If you are not sure
what plagiarism is, please read the [ Student
Code](gopher://UKCC.uky.edu:70/Otext%20STINFO%21191/CODE.TEXT).  
![](upfinger.gif)Back to Table of Contents

#### POLICY ON LATE WORK

Keeping up-to-date with each requirement is your responsibility. If you miss a
class or any specified deadline, you MUST contact me in advance. At the very
least, call and leave a message with the division secretary (257-6131) -- but
if you wish to maintain full credit for a scheduled assignment, you must
negotiate with me to find an acceptable compromise deadline. There is no
guarantee that you will be allowed to make up for a responsibility you have in
this class unless you have communicated with me and made alternative
arrangements before the scheduled deadline.

#### Questions?

Send me your questions by entering the data in this form, and I will get an
email message. Please make sure to enter the information necessary for me to
get an answer to you via email, phone or snail mail.  Your name

Your email address (or alternative method to communicate with you)

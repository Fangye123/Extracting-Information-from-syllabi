**PURPOSE AND SCOPE:**  
This course provides an introduciton to the history of Central America and the
Hispanic Caribbean (Cuba, Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic) since the early
nineteenth century.  It is organized around the concept of national political
histories--that is, the formation of independent states after centuries of
Spanish colonial rule.  Within this framework we will also examine aspects of
the social history and economic development of the region, including the study
of land and labor systems, gender relations, race and ethnicity, community and
class formation, and state formation.   Nonetheless, the readings are intended
to provide an overview of the principal historical themes in the literature on
each of the countries covered.

Please notice that this course will rely heavily on student discussion of
readings.  I will provide an  introductory lecture, but for the most part I
will be eliciting, directing and reorienting class discussion by posing
questions and suggesting themes and perspectives.  Class sessions are for
discussion of issues, questions, relationships, concepts, and approaches.

**REQUIREMENTS:**  
_Your participation_ in this class constitutes a contract between you and
myself. As part of this contract I expect you to follow the guidelines
presented here and I in turn will do my best to convey to you, in a variety of
manners, the most important themes in the study of Central American and
Hispanic Caribbean history.   Most important, I expect a reasonable degree of
enthusiasm and interest from you.  You will have to complete all requirements
in order to receive a grade in this course.  I expect you to come to all class
sessions and be on time.  I expect all students to participate in debates and
discussions, and to feel free to bring in any additional materials, sources,
or questions to class meetings.

_You can expect from me_ : Useful written comments on your work but also oral
and individual feedback.  Careful guidance of class discussion in an open-
ended but still directed fashion.  Openness to consider new questions and
different ways of understanding things.  Respect for your opinions and
experiences but also a careful prodding of your assumptions, biases and
silences.  Fair grading and evaluation and reasonable expectations as to what
can be learned in one semester, despite the longer-than-average reading load.
Most importantly: a passionate interest and concern for the peoples of the
countries we will be talking about, and a live fascination with all aspects of
history.  I will also provide you with weekly questions that will guide your
work and give you a sense of what I expect you to come away with at the end of
the week.

_Participation_ :  Your participation in class activities, including
attendance, will be an important component of your final grade.  The short
assignments that form part of the participation grade include short response
papers.  They should be about one page long and need not be typewritten.  They
should, however, reflect some thinking, coherent questioning, analysis or
reflections upon some aspect of that weeks readings.

_Films_ :  I will schedule four or five films as part of this course.  Some
showings will be during class time, others will not.  Attendance is required
and encouraged.

**DETERMINATION OF GRADE:**

  * Two discussion papers (20% each)
  * Final Exam (15%)
  * Final discussion/research Paper (20%)
  * Class participation, short assignments, presentations (25%)

Late papers and assignments will be penalized for each day of lateness at the
rate of a third of a grade per day (B to B-, B- to C+, A to A-, etc).

In the calculation of the final grade of borderline cases improvement and
dynamic class participation will be decisive factors.  I consider all students
equally capable of successfully completing the requirements for this class
with an above average grade.  In other words, I do not automatically assume
that there cannot be "too many" A's (or C's, for that matter) in any class.  I
take into consideration the best and the worst that a particular class
produces in determining the grade of all students.

Two Short Discussion Papers:  I will provide the topics for these papers.
Some will be based on class readings and discussion while others will involve
some additional or individual work.  These papers will need to be 6-7 pages in
length and reflect your participation in class, your completion of readings,
and your own analysis of the materials.  They will be due as indicated in the
handout that explains each project.  They must conform to the history
department's [handbook on the writing of
papers](http://intranet.holycross.edu/departments/history/alauria/style.htm).
The third paper will combine discussion of in-class readings and issues with
open-ended research and a in-class report on a specific country.  Each student
will also be responsible for organizing class discussion once during the
semester.

A signficant part of your grade will be determined by your class
participation, weekly written work and attendance. Students will often be
asked to prepare  1-3 page reports on the readings and participate in
presentations of the assigned materials. Sometimes these short assignments
will be a summary or discussion of the readings. Other times I will ask you to
answer specific questions.

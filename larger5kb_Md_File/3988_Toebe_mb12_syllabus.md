**Recommended study aids/facilities**  


  * There are usually student tutors available for microbiology (schedules vary each semester). All tutors have achieved a grade A in the course and have gone through tutor training. Make use of them early and often!
  * Use the website that supports your textbook at **<http://www.wiley.com/college/black>**
  
The website offers a variety of study options and resources, including self-
testing, an audio glossary and flash cards to help you learn concepts and
terms.  The website also provides focused web searches, exploration
activities, web-links to related content and access to animations.

  * Make use of the BAT-LAB. See the materials available in the catalog ( includes: supplemental microbiology texts, an oil immersion microscope and microscope slide sets).  On duty instructors are available to help you with questions.
  * Make use of the CCSF library & the learning assistance center
  * Free seminars are held on many Fridays at noon in room 300 of the Biology Department. I urge you to attend these talks to broaden your experience of biology. Seminars are listed on the Biology Department website.
  * Most lecture outlines and links to information on microbiology are available on my website. **WARNING!** This website is NOT a replacement for the required text .   It is essential that you still take your own lecture notes and organize them.

**Course requirements for microbiology 12.**

**Prerequisites**  
A passing grade in Chemistry 32 (or equivalent) is a prerequisite for
microbiology 12.  You must provide proof (e.g., copy of a transcript) of the
prerequisite no later than the second week of class.  You are expected to have
a background in basic chemistry or you will be at a disadvantage. Failure to
meet to the prerequisite status WILL lead to you being dropped from
microbiology.

**Study Time, Note-taking**

You should allow a minimum of 12 hours a week for homework for this class.  If
you want to do really well in the class over 15 hours is recommended.  Read
the hand outs on how to study more effectively for this class and try the SQ3R
method.

**Attendance and lateness**

You are responsible for the information in the CCSF catalog concerning class
attendance and tardiness:

  * Over 2 absences (lecture and lab count independently!) will affect your course grade and/or lead to an instructor-intiated drop. If you have planned a vacation, business trip, family reunion, wedding, etc that will require a week or more absence you should take the class when your schedule permits.  Do NOT enroll and tell me this after the fact! I do not consider any of these warranted absences and I will drop you from the class.
  * More than two absences **must be** **officially   documented or excused**
  * Excessive lateness and/or failure to stay in lab for the required period will be considered an absence.

**Illness**  
If you contract a illness such as a cold or the flu do not come to class as
long as you are contagious.  Call the instructor as soon as possible and
inform her you will be absent and make arrangements to make up the work.

**Disruption**

If you are disruptive in either lecture or laboratory you may be asked to
leave the class and/or be subject to further discipline according to the CCSF
catalog.  
**Cell phones and pagers are NOT allowed in the classroom.   These devices
must be turned off during class time. If you have to use them in an emergency
please leave the classroom.**

**Cheating**

Cheating will not be tolerated and will result in an automatic F for the exam
in question with subsequent discipline according to the CCSF catalog.

Cheating includes:

  * assisting someone else on an exam
  * talking at any time during an exam
  * looking at someone else's paper during an exam
  * copying lab reports or articles (plagiarism) without using your own words, ideas or giving credit (referencing) others. This includes internet plagiarism.

**Special needs**

I encourage students with special needs (e.g. learning/physical disabilities)
to approach me and discuss their needs in confidence. It is highly recommended
that such students register with and be evaluated by the Disabled Students
Programs Services (DSPS) . The DSPS program is a very helpful resource to
assist your particular classroom needs. Note: we work with potentially
hazardous microbes in the laboratory. It is advisable to inform the instructor
in confidence if your immune status is compromised in some way. You need not
be alarmed if you are immune compromised as it is  possible for you to take
this class safely.

**Seating**

Seating in the microbiology laboratory is organized by the instructor the
second week of lab. Students must follow the assigned seating plan.

**Letters of recommendation**

I get many requests for letters and I must require that all requests are in
writing and that you give me a minimum of TWO WEEKS notice. Sorry no
exceptions.

**Materials required for the microbiology laboratory**

Make sure you have all the materials listed below by the second week of lab. I
will check that you have your supplies.  You will be assigned a permanent lab
station, microscope and locker drawer by the second week of lab.

  * A laboratory coat or _long-sleeved_ shirt that covers you below the waist. Sweat shirts and T shirts are not acceptable.
  * A set of microscope slides and box to hold them (CCSF bookstore).
  * A booklet of lens paper (Walgreens or other pharmacies).
  * Rubber bands: used to tie back long hair and to band plates and tubes together.
  * A set of coloring pens or pencils (include pink and purple).
  * A wax marker pencil or thick point, Sharpie brand permanent  marker
  * A small set of wooden clothes pins for use in staining procedures. Do not bring plastic pins.
  * Note: gloves are provided when needed

Note:  YOU MUST BRING YOUR LAB MANUAL, ATLAS  AND WEAR YOUR LAB COAT _EVERY_
LAB PERIOD.   FAILURE TO DO SO WILL AFFECT YOUR GRADE AND ATTENDANCE IN LAB.

**Exam and grading policy for MB12.**

  * There are no "throw -out" exams. All material covered in microbiology is equally important!
  * I do not "curve" exam grades
  * Students with special needs cannot be given extra time on exams unless they have registered and been assessed by DSPS (this is State law).
  * Generally there are **NO "MAKE-UP"** exams. If a genuine emergency requires that you miss course work you must provide me with appropriate written documentation (e.g. Dr.'s certificate). LAB PRACTICALS AND THE FINAL EXAM CAN BE TAKEN ONLY AT THE DATE AND TIME SPECIFIED.   You should check your schedule to make sure that you have no conflicts with the assigned dates.
  * With rare exceptions **you should take assigned exams with your own section**.   Do NOT ping about!
  * **If you have a dispute about a grade DO NOT approach me during class.** I will only reconsider your grade if you note your point on the work in question and submit it to me in writing for consideration.
  * Keep all graded work that is returned to you in case questions arise.
  * Programmable calculators and dictionaries are not allowed during exams.
  * Note: If you are within 10 grade points (not percentage points) of a letter grade at the end of the semester you will be awarded the higher of the two grades IF AND ONLY IF you had a good record of attendance and participation. If you are 11 or more points away you stay where you are!

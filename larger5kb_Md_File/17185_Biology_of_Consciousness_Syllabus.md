**

### A few assumptions and principles that I start with.

  * There is a real physical world.   

  * Science is an attempt to reproducibly characterize that world in predictive ways   

  * This results in useful constructions that are what we know about the "true" nature of things.   

  * The physical brain evolved in ways consistent with Darwinian principles of natural selection.   

* * *

### What are we talking about when we use the term consciousness, and what can
we know about it?

[fMRI](http://www.biophysics.mcw.edu/BRI-MRI/afnisample.html) of a visual-
motor task. Use this to familiarize yourself with typical images.

Note the usual MRI convention that the LEFT side of the head is presented at
the RIGHT side of the picture, as if one were facing the subject and looking
upwards at the head. (this is not always the case, and images are usually
labeled so you can tell.) Also note that there is activity in the visual
cortex, at the back of the brain, as well as in the motor area of the cortex.  

Task-related fMRI [images](http://www.cmrr.drad.umn.edu/fmri_images.html) and
[single images](http://www.cmrr.drad.umn.edu/fMRImovie.html) from a movie.

Note that the movie itself is not in a format that many browsers can handle.
However, the single images and their explanations are of interest. Be sure you
understand that the images are often viewed in different planes, such as
saggital, coronal and axial. Be sure you understand the basis of the TASK-
RELATED nature of these images.

  * **Illusions: tricks the brain plays.**  
Start with the Online discussion and demonstration [Tricks of the
Eye](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/latinhib.html) at Serendib. Be sure to
visit all the links at Serendib related to illusions, including: [Seeing more
than your eye does](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/blindspot1.html) (four
link levels), and [lateral
inhibition](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/latinhib_app.html).  

_Optional_ : While at Serendib you might want to play [The Prisioners
Dilemma](http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/playground/pd.html) in order to
experience how one can operate in a cognitively ambiguous environment.  

Next, go to [Illusion
Works](http://www.illusionworks.com/html/jump_page.html), which has examples
of the major types of illusions, as well as discussions about them. Be sure to
see: [Introduction to
Illusions](http://www.illusionworks.com/html/introduction_to_perception.html),
the [Interactive Demonstrations Hall of
Illusions](http://www.illusionworks.com/html/hall_of_illusions.html), and
[Illusions in Art](http://www.illusionworks.com/html/illusion_art_museum.html)
including the
[discussion](http://www.illusionworks.com/html/illusion_in_art.html).  

Then, you should check out the sites [Fun Things in
Vision](http://www.yorku.ca/eye/funthing.htm) and the [Visual Illusions
Gallery](http://valley.uml.edu/landrigan/illusion.html). While many of the
illusions there are repeats of ones at the ones above, in some cases the
display format is different and some not at the other sites are shown.  

**IMPORTANT TECHNICAL NOTE** : The Browser you use needs up-to-date plugins
for Java and Shockwave to see some of these demos properly (or at all). If it
is your own machine and you know what to do, you can follow the onscreen
suggestions for installation of the necessary items. Most of the browsers on
campus should work, but some may not be properly updated. If you have trouble,
look for a machine that is current, such as in a faculty lab you have access
to.

  * **The Binding Problem.**  
This is treated in an [on-line
seminar](http://www.phil.vt.edu/ASSC/esem3.html) run by the Association for
the Scientific Study of Consciousness. Start by reading the [target
article](http://www.phil.vt.edu/ASSC/engel/engel.html), _Temporal Binding,
Binocular Rivalry and Consciousness_. Then examine the [commentary and
discussion](http://www.phil.vt.edu/ASSC/esem3.html) items that interest you.

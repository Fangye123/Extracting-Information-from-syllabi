_COURSE DESCRIPTION_

This course is intended as an introduction to labor markets and labor
relations in the United States.  The focus is both analytical and historical.
Therefore, we will seek to understand 1) how labor markets operate and examine
if they operate the same way for everyone; 2) how labor economists test their
theories about how the labor market works; 3) the role of collective action in
influencing wages, employment, and control over the production process; and 4)
the current restructuring of the U.S. labor market.

Course requirements include three exams and a 8-10 pg. concept review essay.
The exams will count for 30% (exam #1), 30% (exam #2), and 20% (exam #3) of
your grade while the essay paper will count for the remaining 20%.

_Exams_ : The exams are in-class and will require short answers (including
graphs) and essays.  Though, in general, class lectures will follow the format
and arguments presented in the text, I will occasionally include additional
material (or delete material) in the class lecture/discussion.  You will be
responsible for everything we cover in class.

Please note that this course meets twice a week.  Given the cumulative nature
of the course material by missing a class you can be assured that you are
missing significant technical material.  Since - except in the case of well-
documented emergencies - no make-up exams will be given, please make sure that
you have no scheduling conflicts on Monday and Wednesday afternoons for the
Winter semester.

_Paper_ : The paper is to be a more in-depth  review of a labor economics
concept or theory covered in class.  You will need to uncover the history of
the concept or theory (when was it developed and what economic conditions
motivated its 'discovery'?), its main analytical contribution to the field,
its opponents or detractors and its current status or use.  Examples include:
human capital theory, minimum wage, affirmative action policy, compensating
wage differential theory, a theory of labor discrimination, marginal
productivity of labor, sheepskin effect, and efficiency wages to name a few.

_Notice to Students with Disabilities_

_The University will make reasonable accommodations for persons with
documented disabilities.   Students need to register with Disability Resource
Services every semester they are taking classes.  DRS is located in Counseling
and Support Services, 1060 UM. To be assured of having services when they are
needed, students should register no later than three weeks after the first day
of classes._

**COURSE GOALS** :

To become more open to a variety of music and musical styles. To provide basic
information about Western music with emphasis on classical music and jazz. To
create an awareness of the unique qualities found in various musical styles
and to examine their development. To experience these types of music through
recorded and live performances.  



This is a web/email based course. All assignment are due via email or via KYVU
(web based). You are expected to check your email daily and log onto KYVU and
complete assignments twice each week. The first 2 classes and 4 tests are
required, face-to-face, on-campus (NKU) sessions. If you are not comfortable
about using the web and email and/or you are not willing to learn, or cannot
come to campus for the opening classes and tests, please pick a different
course. Thank you.

_Please read this entire syllabus. Items from the end are just as important as
items from the beginning. This is our contract. If any changes are made
(usually just error corrections), you will receive ample notice._

**_THIS online version of the syllabus is the "official" version, NOT the
printed copy._**

*One concert review will be the [Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (CSO)](http://www.cincinnatisymphony.org/calendar.html) (Cincinnati Pops/Casual Classics do not count), one will be an "[other classical concert](http://www.nku.edu/~music/concerts.html)" (OCC), and one will be [jazz.](http://www.bluewisp.com) Concerts (OCC, CSO, Jazz) may be attended in any order. You may use a second CSO as your OCC.  
**  
****Late reviews** will be lowered 5 points up to two (2) days, and up to 15
points thereafter. The first review turned in is your first review, the
second, your second, and so forth. You can turn in all three in the first week
of class if you want, or you can put them off until the deadlines. You may not
begin with the 2nd or 3rd review. **  
  
Late KYVU assignment ** will not be scored and your points will be lost. **  
**

**Participation:**

  * Class participation via email and/or KYVU is essential to the educational goals of this course. All students are expected share and actively participate in all class activities and discussions.
  * All students are expected to complete the assigned listening and readings (below). Reading assignments are expected to be done in time for the current class lecture.
  * KYVU/Blackboard assignments are online web-based assignments. You must have a web browser (Explorer suggested) to do these assignments. Web-based assignments turned in via email or paper will not be graded.
  * Not turning in the first two assignments or missing the Fundamentals Quiz will result in you being dropped from the course.
  * During the 2 required classes, you are expected to bring your books and questions. These face-to-face classes count the same as online assignments (~ 5 points each)
  * **Late arrival** disrupts the class and shows disrespect for your peers. Please be on time. You may attend either of the sections - 9:00 am or 11:00 am. All the sections are interchangeable (this includes test taking as well).
  * **Signing in** to the face to face classes is something you must do yourself. Signing in for a friend is a serious problem and can result in dismissal from the course.
  * There are no excused absences, only made-up absences (keep reading). Make-Up work must be turned in via email within 5 days of the absence, and MUST include an email summary of the book chapters/materials covered during your absence, AND missed in-class writing assignments **** (email to [johnston@nku.edu](mailto:johnston@nku.edu)) **.** These must be a minimum or 450 words in length.

**Readings and Tests**

In this web-based course lectures are not so much a part of the course, so a
disciplined reading/study regimen will be critical to your success. On the web
page you will find the topics from my lecture slides from previous semesters.
These may help you organize the materials as long as you keep in mind that
these are only outlines upon which I would hang my actual lectures. There are
also study guides which are simply listings of the terms you need to master so
you won't be surprised when you see the test.

The following is a suggested reading/study regimen for you to follow. It shows
how many class sessions I used to present lectures on various topics, and
therefore how you should allocate your time in the study of those topics.

![](http://www.nku.edu/~johnston/point.gif)**First assignment (1a), due
Wednesday, January 16, 2002, before 5:00 pm:**



**Purpose** \- To get to know each other, and demonstrate proficiency with
email and the web via KYVU.



**All 3 parts are due before Wednesday, January 16, 2002, before 5:00 PM** :

**Part 1** **:** Send an Email message to Professor Johnston in the following
(exact) format:

\--example--

**Subject** : MUS 100 01 (or 02, 03, 04)  
**To** : [johnston@nku.edu ](mailto:johnston@nku.edu)<Professor Johnston>  
**From** : myusername@myisp.edu  
  
**Name** : Im A. Student, Junior, Biology major  
**Address** : 375 Fine Arts, NKU, Highland Heights KY 41099  
**Contacts** : 555-5687 (home), studenta@nku.edu, 555-1432 (cell phone #),
555-1234 (pager #), 555-4321 (business phone #), http://www.nku.edu/~studenta,
etc.  
  
**Musical Background** : Dixie HS Band and jazz band, trombone. I also play
some piano, bass, and trumpet.  
  
**Musical Likes/dislikes** : I am a musical eclectic; that is to say I like
almost any style or type of music if it is good music. I always try to keep an
open mind when others play their favorite music for me. I tend to favor so-
called "classical" music and jazz as my personal favorites. My favorite
artists are Yo Yo Ma and Stan Kenton.  
  
**Expectations** : From this class I hope to learn more about the history of
music and how it developed into modern music, and I want to learn about the
lives of composers and become familiar with a wider scope of music than I
listen to now. In other words, I want to broaden my musical horizons.  
  
**Comments** : I'm really looking forward to attending the 3 concerts!

 \--

**Part 2** **:** **Post this same information on**[
**KYVU**](http://learnonline.nku.edu) **but without the address/phone number
information.** **  
  
****Part 3** **:** **Finally (in**[ **KYVU**](http://learnonline.nku.edu) **),
enter this same information under "Tools: Personal Information," and create
your personal home page. Also, feel free to upload a picture of yourself
(optional)!**  
  
---  
  
Go back to the top

  
**TESTS:**

  * Tests will consist of questions from the discussion assignments and readings, recognition of music from the CDs included with your book. The CD-ROM will be an excellent study guide for the book and the listening.
  * For all musical selections, know the composer, name of the piece, and the period in which it was written.
  * Study sheets are available on the class web page, but these cover the terms used on tests and do not reveal the questions themselves.
  * Material from chapters 1-6 is cumulative and may appear on any test. The rest of the chapters are self-contained.
  * Because of the volume of material, there is no cumulative final.
  * **You are allowed only one make-up test, and a valid written excuse/Dr's. note must be presented at the time of the test (usually the next class day following the test at Noon, 375 FA).**

  
**Plagiarism** (representing another's work as one's own) or cheating will
result in failure and/or dismissal from the course. Signing in for someone
else will have the same effect. You are expected to properly attribute any
materials from any source (web, books, CD's, articles, etc.) that you use in
any concert reviews or online assignments.  
  

Go back to the top

* * *

**YOUR THREE CONCERT REVIEWS**



  * Reviews are 50-point graded **email** assignments. The grade is determined by how close you follow each of the requirements from this page, and meeting the assigned deadlines. Reviews may be turned in early.
  * Of the 3 concerts you will attend, one will be the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra (CSO), one will be an "Other classical __ concert" (OCC), and one (and only one) will be [jazz](http://mus100.nku.edu/mus100/bluewisp.pdf). These may be attended in any order.
  * Reviews MUST be 450 words or more to get full credit, and are prorated down from there.
  * Only live performances from THIS SEMESTER are acceptable!
  * Rock and/or R&B and/or country and/or night club and/or club performances do NOT count as jazz events per se. When in doubt, check with your instructor BEFORE you attend the concert and write your review.
  * High school band concerts and/or regular church services do NOT count as classical performances. Again, when in doubt, check first.
  * Arriving late or leaving a concert early is very bad etiquette and unacceptable for this class. Plan to stay for the entire concert. For the Blue Wisp, this means one entire set (from break to break, about 9:30 pm to 11:00 pm for the first set). Your comments should reflect the first and last pieces on the concert.
  * Follow the format of the sample review outline at <[http://mus100.nku.edu](http://www.nku.edu/~johnston/mus100.htmlx)>.
  * To get full credit, reviews are due within 5 days of attending the concert or by the date listed in this syllabus (whichever comes earlier).
  * The reviews **must** be 450 words minimum. However, super long reviews are not necessary.
  * The concert reviews must be sent via email to [**johnston@nku.edu**](mailto:johnston@nku.edu). I suggest that you do your reviews on a word processor with spell-checking and cut and paste them into your email ( **NOT as an attached file** ). If you have difficulty writing, please make an appointment with the Writing Center (BP 230). Look over your review before you send it.
  * All NKU students have email accounts <[http://webmail.nku.edu](http://webmail.nku.edu)>. If you don't know your email account name or how to use it, visit the Academic Computing lab on the 3rd floor of the AS&T building and ask one of the lab assistants for help (859-572-6911). You can also get a web-based account for free at <[http://www.hotmail.com](http://www.hotmail.com)>.
  * Put " **MUS 100 Review** " (without the quotes) in the subject line of your email message. If your email was sent correctly, you will receive an email response within 24 hours. If you don't, see me right away!
  * Save a copy of the programs/tickets from the concerts/events in case you are asked for further verification of attendance.
  * **I** **nclude the name of group or event, date of the performance, your name, course name and section number in the top of the body of each of your reviews**.
  * You MUST make written comments about individual pieces you hear during the concert, not just general broad comments. Comment on specific things you hear and see and your reaction to them. Keep your comments relevant to the class. **You must use the section headers from the sample review!**
  * Your emailed reviews may be projected on the screen for the whole class to see or parts shared with the class via email. Keep your comments and language such that this would not be a problem. 
  * You might want to comment on any of the following: Caliber of performance, Programming, Type of Music, Likes/Dislikes, Style, Showmanship, Overall effectiveness of performance, Crowd reaction, Or any additional comments you feel appropriate.
  * **Make your comments literate and insightful. Avoid shallow, trite, cute comments.** Demonstrate your depth of understanding of the music you hear and how it relates to the lectures. Use proper musical terminology as appropriate.

  * **Dee Felice's (Mainstrausse in Covington)**.
  * **Others only with specific pre-concert approval by Professor Johnston**  Email reviews and KYVU assignments should be succinct yet full of interesting information and insights. They should use terms you have learned in class, and reflect on musical concepts you have gained from class. Please make every word meaningful. Excessively wordy assignments will be graded down. 450 word minimum.

**This Music Appreciation section requires specific listening assignments and
concert going events. These may cost up to about $20.00 in tickets, Video Tape
rental, etc. If you are not prepared to do the listening and attend the
concerts conscientiously, please pick a different course. Thank you.**

[![](wisp.gif)](http://www.nfo.net/.WWW/post50s.html#BWBB)

  
  
The nights to visit the Wisp are Wednesdays. They start their first set around
9:30 pm and usually have 2-3 sets per evening. Sets go for about 1 hour plus a
little.  
  
Dress is casual. Anything from jeans on up is fine.  
  
The Blue Wisp's address is Presidential Plaza, 19 Garfield Place, Cincinnati.
Phone 721-9801. I usually go up Vine Street until I see the public library.
Then I turn left (west) onto Garfield Place, two one-way streets divided by
green space (between 7th & 8th streets). Go about a block, look to your left
and you will see the Blue Wisp's neon sign. Park. The Wisp is downstairs. I
think the cover is $7.50 and a one drink minimum (Cokes are fine). Drivers
should not drink!  
  
I like to go myself, so if you are getting a group together, include me!  
  
Have fun. Professor Johnston

**Email and the Web**

  
As an NKU student, you have an email account. You can access your account from
any of the many lab computers located all across campus, in NKU libraries, in
libraries all across the city, from web capable home computers, or any web
capable computer anywhere around the world.  
  
NKU WebMail  
[ Academic Technology and Services (ATS) [Helpdesk (859)
572-6911]](http://www.nku.edu/%7Eit/cs/helpdesk/) is proud to announce a new
email client on campus NKU WebMail. WebMail is a Web browser based email
client. It is especially useful for students and faculty / staff who are
traveling. WebMail offers a secure, intuitive user interface with icons,
buttons, folders, address book, and even a spell checker. It is platform
independent, which means there is no specific email software to install. All
that is required is a machine (Mac or Win) running a browser (Netscape or
Explorer) with access to the World Wide Web. Web-based mail uses your current
NKU email and password.  

TO FIND YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS, GO TO THE <http://www.nku.edu/start/> WEB PAGE.

  
How do I use WebMail?  
You can login to NKU's WebMail by starting your Web browser and entering the
address:  
  
**<**[ **http://webmail.nku.edu**](http://webmail.nku.edu) **>  
**  
At the login screen, click on the box next to Username and enter your NKU
email username, press the TAB key, enter your password, then click Log In.
This is the same username and password that you use for your other email
clients such as Eudora or Netscape mail. The system will display your New-Mail
folder. You will probably want to mark this page as a favorite in your
browser. For student's convenience, there will be a desktop shortcut to NKU's
Web-mail on all ATS lab machines.  
  
Where is a graphical user guide for NKU Webmail?  
There is a complete HELP function within NKU WebMail. However, we have created
a two page graphical guide on our FTP site for you to download. We will have
printed versions of this guide available from as many labs on campus as
possible. You can get a Word (.DOC) or Acrobat Reader (.PDF) file to download
and print from:
<f[tp://ftp.nku.edu/downloads](http://www.nku.edu/htbin/change_password)>  
  
Students have email accounts automatically created at the beginning of each
semester. However, students must have a valid NKU ID - because we base the
accounts on the ID data base. For students to find their account, they should
go to
<[http://www.nku.edu/www/findit.html](http://www.nku.edu/www/findit.html)> and
enter their last name in the NKU Email Search field and press Name Search. You
can also call the ATS Help Desk at x6911. For new accounts, the initial
password is the last eight digits (no spaces) of the ISO number found on the
NKU ID card. You will be asked to change the password the first time you
access your account. You can also change your password at any time using the
Web at
<[http://www.nku.edu/htbin/change_password](http://www.nku.edu/htbin/change_password)>.  
  
You may use NKU Webmail, or NKU VAXmail through direct login or through NKU's
SMTP server. Of course, you may use your own non-NKU email account if you have
one, or one of the commercial email accounts like www.hotmail.com,
www.email.com, etc. But PLEASE use your own account. Do not borrow accounts
from friends.  
  
By the way, it is VERY IMPORTANT that you conclude each message with your name
and the class/section number. Also, always put MUS 100 in the subject line
and/or "reflection" or "review" as appropriate. Finally, use only regular
messages with no imbedded html or attached files. For examples of assignments,
see <[http://mus100.nku.edu](http://www.nku.edu/~johnston/mus100.htmlx)>.

![](http://www.nku.edu/~johnston/point.gif)**What are**[
**KYVU**](http://learnonline.nku.edu) **assignments and how can I get there?**

As a member of this class, you have not only an NKU email account, but a
Kentucky Virtual University (KYVU) account as well. Our weekly assignments
will be due via KYVU. These are usually due on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:00
p.m. and are worth about 5 points each. These are your participation grades
and total 150 points of the total course, making KYVU participation very
important.

Your username is your first and last name (ex. James Smith) as they appear on
your NKU records. **Your initial password is the first 4 letters of your last
name plus the last 4 numbers of your social security number (smit1234).** You
have the option of changing your password any time. If you have trouble
getting on, call the [ NKU Help Desk](http://www.nku.edu/~it/cs/helpdesk/)
859-572-6911.

There are some rules for using KYVU. First, weekly participation is important.
So you need to log on each week. You may not get last week's points by
doubling up the following week. Once 5:00 p.m. Thursday has passed, the week
is over until the next week starts Monday. So you may neither turn in KYVU
work early nor late - it must be turned in within the window. Of course, you
may actually do the work early, just not turn it in outside the window.

Second, KYVU submissions need to be a minimum of 200 words each. You will
simply not get your 5 points for a 199 word submission. The word count appears
at the bottom right of your submission.

After you click on the save button, you have a 15 minute window to click on
edit and make changes. After that, only I can change or delete your
submission.

Most KYVU assignment will be 'class public' - meaning the whole class can see
them. Click on the Forum icon, then on the word 'Thread.' But some will be
private - only you and I can see them. For these, you will click on the word
'Assignment.'

The Tuesday assignment will usually be sent out either by email or posted on
KYVU by Friday of the previous week (but don't turn them in before Monday!).
These will be assignments designed to get you to think about the readings
(totally your responsibility) and/or listening for the current musical period.
The Thursday submission will typically be your reaction to what one of your
classmates has written, or another prescriptive assignment posted on
Wednesday.

At any time you may email [me](mailto:johnston@nku.edu) for help or
clarifications about the assignments.

KYVU and email assignments are your class participation grades, 10 points per

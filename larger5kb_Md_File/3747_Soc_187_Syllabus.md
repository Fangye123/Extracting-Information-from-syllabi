This seminar explores the Jewish experience in the Catskill Mountains of New
York State. Students will read scholarly work from the areas of history,
sociology, anthropology, Jewish studies; and literature, including fiction,
essays, poetry, autobiography, biography, and memoirs. They will view
documentary and feature films about the Catskills, and listen to music
developed and/or widely played there. They will examine archival material,
including photos, hotel brochures and postcards, synagogue memorial books,
artifacts, local government and business records, and newspaper articles.

A century ago, New Yorker Jews, hungry for mountain air, good food, and a
Jewish environment combined with an American way of leisure, created a resort
area unique in the world. By the 1950s over a million people each year
inhabited the "summer world" of hotels, bungalow colonies, and summer camps.
These resorts shaped American Jewish culture, enabling Jews to become more
American while at the same introducing the American public to immigrant Jewish
culture. Home-grown entertainment provided America with a rich supply of
comedians, musicians, and singers. Legions of young men and women used the
Catskills as a springboard to successful careers and marriages.

In the 1950s and 1960s the Catskills reached the pinnacle of their history,
and starting in the 1970s declined till the point where only a handful of
major resorts remain. The once-teeming roads of the Catskills are largely
barren, with most hotels and bungalow colonies burned, decayed, or destroyed.
Many who worked and vacationed there are very old and may not be able to
provide their history in a short while. There is precious little time left for
scholars, educators, artists, and others to save what remnants there are and
to preserve the legacy of this monumental American Jewish cultural phenomenon.
In 1995, following a successful conference on the History of the Catskills, a
group of scholars and interested persons formed the Catskills Institute to
preserve this legacy. Students participating in this seminar will be part of
that effort.

Depending on their interests, students may be linked with scholars around the
country who are specializing in one aspect of the Jewish Catskills experience.
These consultant scholars are members of the Executive Committee and Advisory
Board of the Catskills Institute, an organization co-founded by the professor.
For example, a student interested in synagogue life will be linked with an
anthropologist studying the synagogues of the areas. A student interested in
Yiddish literature about the Catskills will be linked to a Judaic Studies
scholar in that field. There are a substantial number of such scholars who
will be eager to work with students in this fashion. This will give students a
sense of being part of a larger scholarly effort that simultaneously advances
scholarly knowledge and disseminates popular representations of that work.

Seminar participants will also have the option of working on one of the
following project groups:

  * Developing a multimedia CD on the history and culture of the Catskills.
  * Producing video documentaries based on existing footage, as well as new footage to be shot by students.
  * Producing posters and other graphic art based on Catskills material.
  * Upgrading material and artistically improving the Catskills Institute website (hosted at Brown). This will include a project on "virtual hotels," where users can click on a layout of a hotel, and enter any building and then any room, learning about the people working and staying there. 
  * Assisting in a museum installation now being designed by the Revolving Museum in Boston.
  * Assisting in other museum exhibitions.
  * Assisting in obtaining and cataloging additions to the Catskills Institute archive collection, to be maintained at the American Jewish Historical Society at Brandeis University.
  * Conducting interviews and collecting oral histories and memoirs to add to the growing database of Catskills materials. 
  * Helping plan the Fourth Annual History of the Catskills Conference.

By being involved with a project group and/or an external mentor, students
will have a valuable experience of working in collaborative scholarly efforts
and in making the results very publicly accessible.

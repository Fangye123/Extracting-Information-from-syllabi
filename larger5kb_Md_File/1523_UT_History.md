I. Introduction to the Course_  
History 4030/5030, an advanced baccalaureate and graduate course, examines
western Europe from the late Middle Ages through the early sixteenth century
with an emphasis on the Renaissance. Because it was the birthplace of many of
the important developments during this period, Italy receives considerable
attention. _

II. Reading List_  
Each student should purchase the following books and supplies at the
University bookstore.

*DeLamar Jensen, _Renaissance Europe_ (2nd ed.)  
*Kenneth Bartlett, ed., _Civilization of the Italian Renaissance_  
*Gene Brucker, _Giovanni and Lusanna_  
*Niccol o Machiavelli, _Mandragola_  
*Leon Battista Alberti, _The Family in Renaissance Florence: Book Three_  
*Europe Problem Map #33  
*At least two new blue books, one each for the midterm and final examinations. _

III. Course Requirements_

Students must complete the reading assignments punctually and diligently and
participate regularly in class discussion. Each students will lead a brief
(5-10 minutes) presentation and discussion of one of the assigned readings.

A map exercise in the form of a take-home open-book quiz is due in class on
Thurs., Jan. 22. Students will submit a 4-5 pp. typed, double-spaced essay
based on _Giovanni and Lusanna_ anytime during the semester but _no later
than_ Tuesday, April 21. Instructions for completing the map and the paper are
attached to the back of this syllabus. The instructor encourages students to
make an appointment with the Writing Center, White Hall, 530-4939, for help
with their papers; she will be glad to read drafts or discuss students' ideas
with them in advance of the paper's due date. _Tuesday, April 21, is the last

Students write a midterm examination in class on Tues., Feb. 24. A final exam
is scheduled for Wed., May 6, 2:45-4:45.

The approximate weight of each exercise in determining the course grade is as
follows:  
Map10%  
Midterm25%  
Paper25%  
Final25%  
Presentation and participation15%.

The instructor will take into consideration improvement over the semester when
calculating final grades. _Graduate students_ should consult the instructor
about special requirements for them. **

IMPORTANT**!: The semester system has introduced changes in UTs grading
policies. During the first fifteen calendar days of the semester, students may
freely drop classes; such action leaves no record on their transcripts. From
day sixteen through the Friday of week 8, students may withdraw from a class;
their transcripts will record a grade of W for such classes. An instructor may
issue a grade of IW (Instructor Withdrawal) _only_ for students who register
for a class but who never attend or who attend only briefly and who do not
officially withdraw. All grades of IW must be submitted by the last day of the
tenth week of class. The grade of DR (drop) no longer exists. In this class,
the instructor will submit a grade of IW _only_ for students who never attend,
or who stop attending after the first three weeks. _

Guidelines for the Paper**

Students write an essay based on Gene Bruckers _Giovanni and Lusanna_. Submit
the paper anytime during the semester, but _absolutely_ no later than Tues.,
Apr. 21. Please note that this is the last possible day that the instructor
can accept papers; papers submitted after that deadline receive no credit.

No outside research is required for this paper, but students should make use
of relevant materials from the courses reading list, especially Albertis book
on the family and the set of primary sources edited by Kenneth Bartlett. This
essay can take one of two tacks:

You may examine a particular important theme in _Giovanni and Lusanna_. For
instance, you might discuss the roles and status of women; Florences social
classes; the law; or the institution of marriage.

You might write an analytical review of the book as a whole. Such an essay
should not retell the narrative; you can assume your reader is familiar with
that. Rather, it should analyze such things as the kinds of sources the
historian used in his research; his theme and how well he supports it; how
this case fits into what you have learned about fifteenth century Italian
society, and so on.

The following rules apply to this exercise:

The essay must be 4-5 pages, typed, preferably computer-generated, in standard
type size and with standard margins. If you discover your essay is
substantially longer or shorter, you need to rethink your theme, organization,
and what you are trying to say.

You must use footnotes or endnotes for all words and ideas that are not your
own.

The writing you submit must be your own. It is plagiarism to use anyone elses
prose, including the authors, verbatim or with a word changed here __ or
there. _See the instructor if in doubt_.

Use correct grammar, organize your papers logically and persuasively, and rely
on evidence from the reading to back up your views.

The instructor _strongly_ urges students to discuss their paper topics with
her early in the semester. She will gladly talk over their ideas with them and
read drafts. Students may send drafts, but not the final version, by email or
fax (530-4539). They may also consult the Writing Center, White Hall,
530-4939.

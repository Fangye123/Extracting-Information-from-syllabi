Literature Course Syllabi

# Syllabi and Other Course Materials for Literature Courses

> It should be no surprise that this page is now woefully incomplete -- the
explosion of the number of courses using the Web, along with the explosion in
things I should be doing, have made it impossible for me to keep up with it
all. I'll do what I can, but welcome help.

This collection of syllabi and course materials is maintained by Jack Lynch.
I'm interested only in those that make real use of the Web; a simple course
description or a text-only syllabus isn't enough. If you know of any
literature courses that put their reading lists, course materials, &c. on
either the Web or the gopher, please let me know at
jlynch@andromeda.rutgers.edu. See also my pointers to on-line literary
resources.

**_Course Description_**

This course is organized around reading about and discussing the theme of
history, memory and popular culture in the post-Civil War South. The goal of
the course is to explore the ways in which various groups of southerners have
crafted collective representations of their pasts. During the semester
students will critically analyze representations of the past in civic
celebrations, literature, historic preservation sites, tourist destinations,
and popular culture. The role of ideology, class, gender, and race in shaping
collective memory will be emphasized. Classes will operate in a discussion
format, with brief lectures/comments introducing the various weekly themes. In
addition to completing a research essay, each student will prepare assigned
readings for discussion, participate in class discussion and deliver one class
presentation (15 minute) and write one short essay on the topic of his/her
presentation (7-9 pages). The short essay will critically review a major work
of scholarship on historical memory. In addition, each student will write a
critique of the existing web site (4-5 pages) as well as a critical analysis
of the site the class will visit on its field trip (4-5 pages). Each student
also will write a substantial research essay (15-20 pages) which will
contribute indirectly to the entire class' "virtual museum" site. The second,
longer essay will assess critically a topic related broadly to race relations
and the civil rights movement in Gainesville and/or Florida, the desegregation
of the University of Florida, or contemporary race relations on campus. The
larger research essay will be chosen by the student but approved by Prof.
Brundage.

The centerpiece of the class will be continuing construction of a "virtual
museum" on the Internet that focuses on the desegregation of the University of
Florida. The creation of the "museum site" will enable the class to
participate in all of the decisions involved in selecting what out of the past
will be remembered and how it will be presented. Thus, the class will study
the operation of historical memory in the abstract while simultaneously
engaging in the practical crafting of historical memory. |

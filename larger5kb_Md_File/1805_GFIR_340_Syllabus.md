     American foreign policy is of inherent interest to citizens who pay taxes, produce and consume goods, and may be called upon to sacrifice themselves or their family members in war that is, to every American. It is also of great importance to people the world over. Today the United States is without question the world's greatest military, economic, and cultural power. The disappearance of the Soviet Union and recent Japanese economic stagnation have left America with no immediate challenger. Its military can project high-technology force anywhere in the world quickly; its economy remains the world's largest by far, and its growth rate (at the moment) is the highest of any industrialized country; and (for better or worse) its movies, music, and literature pervade the planet. Now, when trouble breaks out anywhere in the world, most look to America for leadership.
     This course is designed to help you understand why America acts as it does in the world. Although we shall devote time to the question of what the country ought to do in today's world, our primary concern is to explain the causes of U.S. foreign policy. Recent scholarship has concentrated on a number of factors: the international system, or the constraints and opportunities that the outside world presents the country; domestic economic interests; liberal-democratic values and institutions; internal politics; bureaucracies; and psychological traits of leaders. We shall study the usefulness of each type of explanation, using episodes from the 1790s up to the present day as illustrations.

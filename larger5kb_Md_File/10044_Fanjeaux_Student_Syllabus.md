**Course Description:**

This is an interdisciplinary course covering French literature, Art,
architecture and history of the Middle Ages as reflected in southwestern
France. The course will consist of morning classes and daily field trips while
we are in Fanjeaux. Its interdisciplinary approach was chosen in order to take
full advantage of the unique location of our classroom. Fanjeaux is located in
the heart of Occitania, a part of France which was of vital importance in the
Middle Ages. Fanjeaux was significant not only from a religious point of view
--It was the heart of the Albigensian heresy and St. Dominic lived and worked
here for almost ten years--but from an intellectual, artistic and political
one as well. The daily field trips will take us to local sites famous for
their medieval connections, from fortified towns and castles to cathedrals and
museums. We shall actually visit the scene of many of the historic events
discussed in class.

**Readings and Discussions:**  
You will receive a selection of texts which represent the major areas of
literary accomplishment in the Middle Ages-- "chanson de geste," theater,
"Romance," and "poetry"\--as well as excerpts from history tests. In addition
to this packet, we ask you to purchase the Mentor edition of _The Song of
Roland_.

**Professors:**  
Joan Franks, OP, professor of philosophy and director of the honors program at
Ohio Dominican College will be the principal instructor of this class.

  **Requirements:**

1.  Notebook for class notes and your own notes on the readings. 

2.  Notebook for journal of all trips taken, with special notes on places, edifices, objects in museums that have interested you. Both of these notebooks will be used as reference sources for your research papers and will be checked by the professor.

If you have requested a transcript , the Dominican University Registrar will send it to your home institution after September 1st. The subject for the research paper will be decided the first few days of the class so that you can focus your attention on certain aspects that pertain to your topic and take advantage of the field trips to find information that will enhance your subject. The subject should integrate at least two areas of the course. It should reflect classwork and information discovered on field trips. Photography, postcards, and sketches may be included.

From 1849 to the Present

E-mail: [jfujioka@ccsf.cc.ca.us ](mailto:jfujioka@ccsf.cc.ca.us%20)  
Instructor: Janine M. Fujioka, M.A., Ph.C.  
Office Hours: Tuesday 3:15 pm - 4:15 pm in LCW-102, or by appointment.  
Telephone: (408) 864-5700, x6360 (voicemail)  
(408) 864-8430 (Distance Learning Office, call during office hours)  
Fax: (408) 864-8245

**Course Description:**

"Introduction to Asian American Experience" will explore and examine United
States history over the last 150 years with an emphasis on migrant groups to
the U.S. from China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, India and Southeast Asia.
Recent developments and additional topics on other Asians and Asian Pacific
Islanders will also be explored. The theme of the course will be "putting
ourselves in the context of history." Topics are interdisciplinary in nature
including immigration experiences, economic opportunities, political and
social histories, the role of cultural values within self, family and
community. Civil rights issues facing Asian Americans in the 1990's will also
be discussed.

**Course Objectives and Goals:** To enable the student to do the following:

1) to compare and contrast events, forces and movements which have played a
role in the unique circumstances of each group's Asian American Experience in
order to recognize and raise an awareness of important historical, economic,
social, political and cultural factors.

2) to read and critically appraise news and information items in the popular
press and other media that bear on Asian American issues in contemporary
American society.

3) to access important API related websites and to contribute to the growing
API website directory for the class.

**Required Reading, Texts and Materials:**

Takaki, R. (1998). _Strangers from a different shore._ Boston: Little, Brown
& Company. ISBN 0-316-83130-1 (paper)

Civil Rights Issues Facing Asian Americans in the 1990's (Feb 1992). In the
first week, please write a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, 624
Ninth Street NW, Washington, DC 20425 and request a free copy of this book.
Telephone: (202) 376-8128. This book is also available in the campus library.

Four movies/films: Joy Luck Club, One Thousand Pieces of Gold, Picture Bride,
and The Killing Fields. Available in campus media center or rented on your own
at any video store.

An e-mail account with internet capabilities. Additional readings may be
available online via instructor's homepage.

**Course Requirements and Grading:**

Students will complete assignments based on the assigned readings each week.
In addition, students will discuss assigned readings and topics online via the
listserv. Grading will be based on class participation, a midterm examination
(part 1 and part 2), a video write-up project, and a final examination. The
grade for the course will be determined as follows:

Assigned readings and participation online = 15%

Two Midterm examinations (multiple choice & short answer essay questions) =
30%

Video write-up project = 25%

Final exam = 30%

All requirements for the course must be completed on time as assigned. There
are no make up exams. Missing requirements will be considered a grade of zero
for that percentage of the course requirement when computing the final course
grade. Class participation online is required. Student's honor code strictly
enforced. All relevant reading material may not always be covered during
online activities as students are expected to follow the assigned reading and
comprehend without having a lecture on that material. For the exams, send
directly to instructor via e-mail.

Grades in this class will be assigned according to the total points (400 pts)
distributed:

| Online Activity & Readings| 60 pts  
---|---  
Video Write-up Project| 100 pts  
Midterm Exam Part #1| 60 pts  
Midterm Exam Part #2| 60 pts  
Final Exam| 120 pts  
  Points (%)| Grade  
---|---  
360 - 400 (90%)| A  
320 - 359 (80%)| B  
280 - 319 (70%)| C  
240 - 279 (60%)| D  
  
#### Some Important Notes About Final Grades

The De Anza College Administration posts the final grades three to four weeks
after the end of the term. If you would like to know your final grade earlier,
then send me a SASE by the end of Week 9. Final grades will not be disclosed
by e-mail.

If you have a discrepancy about your final grade, please contact me during my
office hours in the following term. I will gladly meet with you or talk with
you by telephone; however, I will only entertain changing a final grade if
there is a computational or administrative error. You may also leave a written
message for me with the Distance Learning Center front office staff.

#### Special Issues For Online Courses

  1. Lost in Cyberspace 
    * Students are responsible for backing up and keeping copies of their submitted materials. If your assignment gets lost in cyberspace, I will ask you to resend it with evidence of timely submission in order to avoid penalties. 
    * If your computer crashes and you are unable to send in your assignment via e-mail before the deadline, I will accept faxes received before the deadline. I will also accept date stamped assignments received in the Distance Learning Center office before the deadline.
  2. Educational Needs of Online Students 
    * Traditional students normally receive written feedback when their exams and papers are returned. In this course, however, assignments are submitted electronically, so students will receive brief comments and scores only. If you would like to discuss any of your returned assignments in detail, please contact the instructor during office hours. Any hard copies of submitted assignments are not returned.
    * Interaction on the Listserv: All students are expected to interact online via the Listserv. This is an important component of the course because it mirrors the dialogue and discussion that would normally take place during class. You are required to share and submit at least six reactions to the readings (see syllabus) during the quarter. At the same time, your active participation in reading and responding to your fellow classmates' responses will help you assimilate the course content and information.
    * Use of Chatroom and Forum: I encourage using the Chatroom and Forum; however, they are optional unmonitored activities. The primary and mandatory online interaction is the Listserv.
    * Photo Gallery: Want to see what your classmates look like? Participate by sending in your scanned photo to the Distance Learning Center [Tech Help](mailto:techhelp@dadistance.fhda.edu) and it will be placed in the Photo Gallery. Include the class number (ICS 20) and your first name only. Since the Photo Gallery is in a public domain, please do not disclose any private information.

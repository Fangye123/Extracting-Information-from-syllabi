**Course Description:** This course explores the ways in which boundaries
defining and separating magic, science, and religion emerged in western
thought and culture from late antiquity through the European Enlightenment,
when the definitions generally recognized in western culture today were
delineated. We will consider the nature of "magic," "science" and "religion"
in historical context, the relationship between learned and popular thought
and practice, and the interplay of disciplines we would define oppositionally
(e.g., astrology and astral magic with astronomy, medicine and healing), while
exploring underlying assumptions about God, Nature and natural forces.

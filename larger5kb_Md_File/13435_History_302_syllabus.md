**Course Objectives and Format**

     This course explores the history of medieval Europe from approximately 400 to 1500.  During this period, many kingdoms and empires rose and fell, many systems and varities of religious belief emerged, spread, and were suppressed, and many millions of individuals were born and died.  We will investigate a little of each of these components of European history.  Our approach will be largely chronological, that is to say, we will generally consider events in order from the earliest to the latest.  The problem with an event-centered history, however, is that it prioritizes changes over continuities and political events over everyday life.  For this reason, we will pause our chronological survey at various moments to examine particular groups of people in medieval Europe and the ways in which their lives resembled and differed from each other.  By the end of the course, you should have a better understanding both of what people mean when they talk about 'the Carolingian period' or 'the Black Death,' for instance, and of what life was like for a medieval peasant, aristocrat, monk, or nun.   
     I will generally lecture on Mondays and Wednesdays of each week.  Our Friday meetings will consist of labs, based on primary sources, historical reconstructions, and movies.   
    


**Readings**

    The required text for this course is: Edward Peters, _Europe and the Middle Ages_ , 3rd edition, 1997 [hereafter "Peters"].  Available at the college bookstore.  We will read a chapter of this textbook for most classes, but we will also supplement it with both primary source readings and articles.

    QUIZZES (15%) will be held on twelve occasions throughout the course.  They will not be announced in advance.  Each quiz will count for 1.5% of your total grade, but your lowest two grades will be dropped.   
    PARTICIPATION (15%) will be assessed according to your contributions to class discussions, both in lectures and in our Friday labs.  Participating in discussions and asking thoughtful questions of me and of your fellow students demonstrates your engagement in and understanding of the subject matter of history.  It also demonstrates your ability to seek out information you do not understand or know, a vital skill for historians.  An implicit part of participation is regular attendance.  Anyone who misses more than 5 classes will automatically receive a zero for participation, which will make it hard to get a decent grade in the course.   
    Your LAB REPORTS (20%) relate to the primary source readings and other assignments we will discuss on Fridays.  For each lab, you willl be given a handout with specific questions and instructions.  You may choose how to use the class period on Fridays to help you answer these questions.  I will assign you to lab groups in the first week of class.  There are ten labs throughout the semester, and you must turn in at least eight.  If you do more than eight, your eight best grades will be counted.   
    Your PAPER (15%) is described on a separate handout (also available from the class website).  It should be a minimum of 6 pages (1750 words) and is due on Wednesday April 18.   
    The MIDTERMS (10% each) will be held on Friday February 9 and Friday March 9.  They will consist of a series of identifications and an essay question.  The potential identification terms will be circulated in advance.   
    The FINAL EXAM (15%) will also consist of a series of identifications, but will include two essay questions.   


PLEASE NOTE:  The honor code is in effect for all quizzes, lab reports,
papers, and exams in this course.  I expect that you will carry out these
assignments individually and independently, and I will send any cases of
suspected plagiarism to the Judicial Board.  Let me, however, clarify three
particular occasions in which it is OK (and even desirable) to use the help of
others.  
    First, I hope that you will work together during our Friday labs in discussing  primary sources and their interpretation.  As a result of your discussion, you will probably come up with very similar answers to short-answer questions in the lab reports, and this is OK.  Do, however, be sure that you write any paragraph-length answers on your own.  That is, it's fine to share _ideas_ , but you must write up these ideas independently.   
    Second, the same goes for midterm and final exam review and for papers -- it's fine to share ideas, but the writing must be your own.  For example, you might run into a friend in the library and start talking about your paper.  She/he might make some comment that you find especially provocative.  As you write your paper, it's OK to explain/respond to that comment, _as long as you don't claim the idea to be your own_.   You might, for example, write something like, "In talking about this reading with [your friend's name], he/she suggested that The Empress Theodora was really . . .  This makes good sense to me because . . ."  In other words, signal clearly in written papers what things are someone else's opinion and what things are your own.   
    Third, I encourage you to seek help with writing.  It is perfectly legitimate to ask others to read over your paper and look for errors of spelling, grammar, and expression.  You might also ask others to look over your written work and help you with paper organization and structure.  I am happy to read drafts of papers, especially if you give me advance warning.  I also encourage you to use the writing center (check out their website:  <http://ehcweb.ehc.edu/faculty/fmitchel/writing/center.htm>).  It is good practice to insert a footnote in your paper in which you thank anyone who has read and commented on a draft.  See me if you'd like me to explain how to insert footnotes and show you examples of scholars thanking others.

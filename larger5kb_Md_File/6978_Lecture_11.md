Cautions

_Dramatis Personae_  
  
Richard M. Nixon, 37th President, graduate of Whittier College and Duke Law,
served in navy headquarters during World War II. Elected as Republican to
California congressional seat. Achieved fame as member of the House Committee
on Un-American Activities, particularly for inciting confrontation between
Hiss and Chambers. Defeated Helen Gahagan Douglas for Senate post in 1950.
Denounced Truman's Asia policies, supported MacArthur's plans to widen the
Korean War, and claimed that the Democrats advocated socialism. Elected Vice-
President under Eisenhower. More to follow.  
  
C. Wright Mills: Columbia sociologist. Believed that the America's
"celebration" of itself during the 1950s had vitiated the radical left and
contributed to the absence of political dissent. He abandoned hope that
American society could effect meaningful reforms, as evidenced by the
interlocking corporate, political and military elites, examined in The Power
Elite (1956). Died in 1962. Hailed as visionary by student activists during
the late 1960s.  
  
Richard Hofstadter: (1916-1970), Columbia historian who sought to understand
the "mood" and the "mind" of America. In Social Darwinism in American Thought,
1860-1914 (1944), Hofstadter attacked the uncritical application of Darwinian
ideas to American society. The rise of McCarthyism in the early 1950s shaped
Hofstadter's opposition to the anti-intellectualism and  
unthinking dogmatism which he thought recurred throughout American history. In
The Age of Reform (1955), he counterposed the cranky and ineffective moralism
of the Populists and Progressives to the pragmatic give-and take of FDR's
politics. During student riots at Columbia in late 1960s, Hofstadter advised
moderation.  
  
Benjamin Spock (1903- ), graduate of Yale, attended medical school at Columbia
and Yale, served residency in Hell's Kitchen in New York City. Began work on
Baby and Child Care in 1943, continued while serving as a psychiatrist in the
Navy, and published it in 1946, when it became an immediate best-seller.
Spock's anti-Vietnam War activism, and opposition to nuclear weaponry, caused
him to be target of Agnew and Nixon.  
  
Readings: Riesman's _The Lonely Crowd_ and Bell's _The End of Ideology_ are
classics of American sociology. Talcott Parsons' sociological works were
formative but nearly unreadable.

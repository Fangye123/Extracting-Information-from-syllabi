**_Course Description_**  
This course is meant as an introduction to some of the central concerns in
contemporary literary theory, for graduate students in literature and other
related disciplines of the humanities or social sciences.   Interested
students from all departments are welcome to contact me in advance to discuss
the seminar.  Advanced undergraduates may also register with special
permission of the instructor. One goal of the course will be to provide
students with a survey of basic tools, vocabulary, and terminology in
theoretical domains such as psychoanalysis, deconstruction, feminism,
visuality, semiotics, and so on.  But the seminar as a group will be primarily
focused on a second goal: That of grappling with four major themes that have
informed much work in literary theory.  The themes we will consider are:
**Language, The Academy, Oedipus** , **and Difference.**  In each case, we
will read what might be described as "foundational" texts from antiquity, and
then modern and contemporary texts that have read and reread the problematics
associated with these themes. In the context of each seminar meeting, there
will be time for students to ask questions of a general and methodological
nature, but we will also focus our attention on our own readings of the
trajectories of these themes.

**_Obligations_**  
The course grade will be based on the following:  
Participation in seminar discussions: 10%  
2 brief oral presentations on assigned texts: 10 % each  
Two essays based on themes: 25% each  
One final paper: 30%  
  
In addition, Comparative Literature students will be required to pass an
examination at the end of the semester on rhetorical terms, literary genres,
and critical terms. Others are welcome to take the exam, and to study with
Comparative Literature students in a group.

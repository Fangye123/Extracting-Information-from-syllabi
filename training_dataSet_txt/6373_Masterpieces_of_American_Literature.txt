COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course looks at representative works relating to 
North America and its peoples, traditions, stories, 
and histories.  While the course is intended to stop 
at 1900, you'll note that some texts are authored after 
that date.  These works have been included because 
they provide significant and useful perspectives.  
We'll cover different regions, different voices, examine 
ideas about what makes a work literary, and what (if 
anything) is "American" about these texts 
or our interpretations.

Throughout the semester, there will be an emphasis on 
critical reading and thinking: challenging assumptions, 
marking similarities or differences across and against 
our expectations.  In addition, we will pay particular 
attention to each text's social, popular, historical 
and cultural location.

The course places an emphasis on class discussions and 
responses.  You will be expected to contribute significantly 
to the class discussions.  Most importantly--you will 
be responsible for having completed readings on the 
day indicated.

REQUIREMENTS/GRADING

	Attendance/Class Participation/Quizzes	 10%	of
grade
	Discussion Leadership	 5%	of	grade
	worksheets (4)	 10%	of	grade
	Research Paper (1)	 25k	of	grade
	Mid-Term Exam	 25%	of	grade
	Final Exam	 25%	of	grade
GENERAL POLICIES
ATTENDANCE:	The attendance grade is computed with class 
participation/quiz grade.  The attendance grade formula 
is as follows:
A:	No more than 2 unexcused absences
B:	No more than 3 unexcused absences
C:	No more than 4 unexcused absences
D:	No more than 5 unexcused absences
F:    6 or more unexcused absences

The only "excused" absence is one supported 
with reasonable documentation: i.e., doctor's note, 
for example.  A cautionary note of my own: since we 
will cover much key material in class discussions and lectures, you skip 
class at your own risk.

QUIZZES:	Quizzes will pop-up if and when the class discussion 
seems to be lagging and or texts are not read as assigned (i.e. on
schedule).

LATE-WORK:	No Late Work will be accepted for worksheets. 
 As both the mid-term and final are in-class, late-work 
in these cases is neither applicable or acceptable. 
 I will accept the research paper late but there is 
a penalty.  Each class day that the research paper 
is late, your grade will be lowered by a letter grade.
EXAMS
 Questions for a take-home mid-term will be handed out on Friday, Feb.
24.	The mid-term is due in-class (no exceptions!) on Wed. March 1.
FINAL:	The final exam schedule is listed on the syllabus. 
 Finals will be given in class, in our regularly scheduled classroom.
GUIDELINES FOR LEADING CLASS DISCUSSIONS

An attached sign-up sheet is for your reference; another 
will be passed around the class for sign-up purposes. 
Choose an author, interest, text, etc. on which you 
want to lead a class discussion.  Sign up for that day.

The responsibilities of the daily discussion leader 
are: 

- Provide interesting, discussion-provoking questions, 
- Offer your own textually-supported interpretation 
and use it to generate discussion,
- Provide background information if and when applicable 
or useful,
- and, most importantly, ask the questions everybody 
else is afraid to ask!

You will also be expected to turn in a typed list of 
the questions you plan to use to lead the class discussion. 
 This list of questions must be handed in on the day 
you lead the class discussion (no late work is accepted).
GUIDELINES FOR WORKSHEETS

There are a total of 4 worksheets due (for due dates, 
see syllabus).  NO LATE WORKSHEETS ARE ACCEPTED (unless 
a reasonable excuse--i.e. doctor's note--is provided 
with the late work).  The worksheets are graded on 
a Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory basis.

The worksheets are designed to be thought/response pieces. 
 While you should always proofread your writing for 
spelling, grammar, punctuation, etc., I want you to 
focus on content.  It will not be necessary to document 
quotes with citations or to do any research for these 
worksheets. (In fact, please don't do either.)

Any additional requirements or parameters will be explained 
in class and/or with each worksheet assignment.
GUIDELINES FOR RESEARCH PAPER

The paper is expected to be a short research paper--i.e. 
it must indicate some library research into your chosen 
topic, and include appropriate citations and a bibliography. 
 The paper must follow MLA guidelines (see the MLA 
Handbook for Writers of Research Papers).  It should 
run between 5-7 double-spaced pages.  PLEASE DO NOT 
EXCEED THAT LENGTH.  Since this is a formal paper, 
you will be graded on punctuation, grammar, well-developed 
ideas, and clearly written prose.

The paper must develop a thesis--an analytic focus or 
argument--which focuses on at least one of the syllabus 
texts (i.e., the paper must only analyze texts on the 
syllabus and may discuss texts appearing after the 
essay's due date).  I will not assign topics, but will 
be happy to discuss any of your ideas.  In order to 
help you get keep on track, you will be expected to hand 
in a 1-page short proposal/description of your paper. 
 This paper proposal will be due on Friday, March 17.

The research paper is due on Monday, April 17.

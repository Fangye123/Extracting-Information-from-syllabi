Chair

#### Dear Friends:

       As some of you may know, Dr Wayne Hoffman was diagnosed with terminal cancer in early May of this year. The cancer spread rapidly and he passed away on May 28th. Dr Hoffman was born in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, on August 12, 1937. He received his Bachelor's degree from Wisconsin State University, Oshkosh, in 1962, his Master's degree from Ohio State University in 1966, and his Ph.D. from the University of Florida in 1970.  
       Dr Hoffman taught at Wisconsin State University, Oshkosh, prior to coming to Western Kentucky University in 1970. He served as Head of the Department of Geography and Geology from August 1977 to May 1999, during which time he built the Bachelor's and Master's degree programs into what are widely acknowledged as among the very best in the southeastern United States.  
       During his career, Dr Hoffman published more than 50 articles in professional journals on topics dealing with city and regional planning, economic development, and the plight of the impoverished. He was also the author of nearly 90 public service technical reports for cities and counties throughout Kentucky, as well as several for regional agencies. In 1987, he received the Outstanding Service Award from the Kentucky Chapter of the American Planning Association for his numerous contributions to the Commonwealth. He also received the Western Kentucky University Public Service Award in 1986, as well as serving on the Barren River Area Development District Board of Directors for several years.  
       Dr Hoffman truly loved his students and always had great appreciation for their success. While we all mourn his passing, the traditions he established will continue with our memories of him. Foremost among these traditions was the emphasis Dr Hoffman placed on having faculty serve as mentors for students with respect to their research and publication efforts. During the 1998-99 academic year there were 17 student paper presentations and publications, either as co-authors with faculty members or independently under the guidance of their faculty mentors.  
       The faculty, of course, continued to be exemplary in their research efforts. During 1998-99, faculty members published 10 refereed journal articles and book chapters, 10 non-refereed articles and presented 49 papers at professional meetings. In addition, 19 technical reports were submitted to various firms and agencies. The bi-weekly Department Seminar Series established by Dr Hoffman was highly successful during the past year, serving to stimulate both student and faculty research interests. The same was true for the field trips and lectures sponsored by the Geology Club.  
       This past year, Ogden College was awarded a Program of Distinction by the State of Kentucky in which the department is now a major player. Fourteen students are currently employed as research assistants in affiliation with the Kentucky Climate Center and the Center for Cave and Karst Studies.  
       We have two new tenure-track faculty members who joined us in August. Dr Mace Bentley from the University of Georgia will serve as the Assistant State Climatologist, ultimately replacing Glen Conner. Jamie Strickland (ABD--also from the University of Georgia) is replacing Dr Mark Lowry who retired in December.  
       Classroom instruction continues to be enhanced by technology. In addition to our two largest classrooms which are equipped with big-screen monitors, computers, and Internet access, softboard (some called "smartboard) technology is on the horizon for our smaller classrooms. These will be equipped with individual student monitors and the ability to download all illustrations from the "virtual blackboard" (or porcelain whiteboard in this instance).  
       In remembrance of Dr Hoffman's legacy, I met with representatives of the WKU Foundation in June to establish the Wayne Hoffman Memorial Fund. This will be a fund for scholarships and financial assistance for research projects for students majoring in geography or geology. If any of you would like to contribute to this fund, checks should be made out to the "WKU Foundation - Wayne Hoffman Memorial" and sent to:  
The WKU Foundation  
Western Kentucky University  
One Big Red Way  
Bowling Green, KY 42101-3576  
       I will be serving as Interim Department Head through December 31, 1999. Early in the fall semester a Search Committee will be appointed to select a permanent department head who will be promoted from within the department. The permanent head will take over on January 1, 2000.  
       We wish you all the very best in the coming year and ask that you please take a few moments and complete the Alumni Information form attached to the back of the GEOGRAM. Whenever you are in the Bowling Green area, please come by and visit. We love to see you. If you are not in the area, drop us a line (either e-mail or snail-mail). Hearing from you is the next best thing.  
Sincerely,

## Eulogy for Dr Wayne L. Hoffman, by Jim Davis

  

####       I am honored to participate today in the celebration of the life of
Dr Wayne Larry Hoffman. As Head of the Department of Geography and Geology at
Western Kentucky University, I recommended that Wayne be hired in 1970, after
he had completed his Ph.D. in Geography at the University of Florida. I worked
closely with Wayne until his death last week. I would like to touch on several
aspects of his life during the twenty-nine years that we worked together.  
       First, Wayne was an excellent teacher. He loved to teach, and his students realized this and liked and respected him. They almost always wanted to take additional classes from Wayne. He was able to explain geographic concepts and apply them to real-life situations for his students.  
       Wayne was also an outstanding researcher. He published more than 140 articles and technical reports during his career, including articles in the leading journals in his field. Most of his research was on topics dealing with city and regional planning, economic development, the plight of the impoverished, and academic administration.  
       Wayne was especially outstanding in the area of public service. He involved many of his undergraduate and graduate students in public service-related research projects that he directed for the Barren River Area Development District (BRADD) and other local and regional planning agencies. Wayne helped many of his undergraduate and graduate students to get fulltime positions in local, regional, or statewide public or private planning agencies.   
       Wayne served either as chair or as a member of numerous community and regional committees as part of his commitment to public service. For many years he was Chair of the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Council of BRADD; Chair of the Solid Waste Advisory Committee of BRADD; a member of the BRADD Board of Directors; a member of the Special Advisory Committee on Mammoth Cave National Park; a Kentucky representative of the Citizens Advisory Committee of the Ohio River Basin Commission; Vice Chair of the General Interest Section of the Ohio River Basin Commission; a member of the Environmental Natural Resource Policy Committee of the National Association of Regional Councils; and a member of the Citizens Task Force, Green River Plan, of the Ohio River Basin Commission. He supervised a district-wide carpooling program and conducted numerous workshops for local government officials. For a number of years Wayne served as the Director of the Center for Local Government, located at Western Kentucky University. Also, with the help of Jack Eversole and others, he was instrumental in bringing the Office of the Kentucky State Climatologist, which serves the entire Commonwealth, to Western, and in establishing the Center for Cave and Karst Studies. Wayne is the first Western faculty member who spent all of a sabbatical leave period working at a public agency on a public service project (at BRADD on a Regional Landuse Plan). He was also active in numerous professional organizations, at the local, state, regional, and national levels, and held positions of leadership in almost every group in which he belonged.  
       Wayne was an outstanding motivator. He stressed to all of us, as faculty members, that we were expected to be very good to excellent teachers that was most important. But also that we should be active in research and public service activities to strengthen our teaching, and to involve undergraduate and graduate students in our projects as often as possible (which Wayne did himself). Our Geography and Geology Department Annual Report, which Wayne started more than 20 years ago, continues to indicate the large number of faculty and student publications and presentations at professional meetings.  
       Wayne was the consummate worker. He was at his office by 6:00 a.m. seven days a week. No one could outwork him (he'd even have the coffee made for his colleagues before they got to school). If he needed to, he would come back at night to work on projects that neeeded to be completed quickly.  
       Wayne had a great sense of humor. He loved to kid his colleagues and, in turn, loved to be kidded. I'm a little more than a year older than Wayne. More than ten years ago Wayne's fiftieth birthday was approaching, and he wasn't particularly looking forward to the big 50! To help him celebrate the event, I sent in $5.00 to AARP (the American Association of Retired Persons) to enroll him as a member in that organization. After that, he always loved to introduce me to people as the senior member of the department (I'm sure he meant in age). He also told a few students that another one of our departmental members, who will remain unnamed, had taught Wayne when Wayne was in high school.  
       Wayne was an excellent role model. He never asked us to do anything that he wasn't willing to do himself. As a person who excelled in teaching, research, and public service (in addition to all of his administrative responsibilities, both at the Departmental, college, and university levels), he gave all of us a high mark to aim for.  
       Wayne was extremely student-oriented and made very clear to all of us that our students were the reason why we were employed. That caught our attention and held it! He initiated student intern programs, which were often successful in placing students in their first full-time jobs after graduation. He also initiated the tracks system in the Department, which permitted students to concentrate in a specific area of a discipline and have even stronger qualifications in preparation for a career immediately after college or in graduate school placement.   
       Wayne's door was always open to everyone, and especially students--Departmental majors, minors, and all others. I have never known an administrator who was as available to students, faculty, and staff members as Wayne. He tried to spend some time each day time sitting in the outer office talking with faculty members and students to keep in touch. He worked hard to get students to go to local and out-of-town professional meetings and often paid part of their expenses out of his own pocket. He initiated the annual Fall hogroast as a means of bringing students, alumni, faculty, and staff members closer together.  
       Wayne was a collaborator in the best sense of the word on research and public service projects with many faculty members and students in the department. In my own case, as one example, Wayne and I collaborated on projects that led to the publication of ten articles and eleven paper presentations at professional meetings. The last project we did, relating to the planning and policy aspects of the proposed multi-modal transportation facility in Warren County, resulted in a paper presented on March 24, 1999, ten weeks ago as I deliver this eulogy today. Wayne's health didn't permit him to go to the meeting with me to present our research results, but his work and analysis were a big part of our presentation.  
       Wayne was a very modest individual. He never mentioned his numerous awards, but I would like to tell you about three of them. First, he was selected for the Outstanding Graduate Student Paper Award presented at the annual meeting of the Southeastern Division of the Association of American Geographers. This was when Wayne was a Ph.D. student at the University of Florida. Second, he won the Western Kentucky University Outstanding Public Service Award for his many contributions to the University, the city and county, the region, and the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Third, he received the Outstanding Service Award from the Kentucky Chapter of the American Planning Association for his numerous contributions to the Commonwealth.  
       Wayne was extremely effective in working with people. He liked people and was a good listener. Our Departmental faculty members regarded him as an extremely democratic and productive department chair. After twenty-three years on the job, Wayne was still highly respected and admired by his colleagues, as well as by others throughout the university. A number of his colleagues called him "Boss," but as a term of respect for his leadership. Wayne was always open to new ideas and to different points of view. He was willing to change or modify his viewpoints, especially if he thought it would benefit students.  
       As you know, we have recently observed the Memorial Day weekend. Wayne served four years in the U.S. Air Force after graduating from high school and was a very patriotic person. He was also a loyal friend to many individuals.  
       The _Reader's Digest_ used to have a series of articles called "The Most Unforgettable Person I Have Ever Known." Wayne Hoffman could certainly fit into that category. He loved and was loved by his family members--his wife of thirty-six years, Sheridah; his mother, Ruth; his children, Candae and Wayne Lee; his sister, Charmaine; his two grandchildren; his son-in-law; and his nieces and nephews. Those many individuals who feel fortunate to have had him as a friend might well agree with a statement that Wayne's son-in-law, Donny Baxter, made to me last week: "Wayne Hoffman was the most outstanding man I have ever met."  
       We'll miss you, Wayne, but we feel fortunate to have known you. You have made a difference in the lives of countless students, colleagues, and others. For that we will always be grateful.

## Outstanding Geography Students, 1998-99

####        The Department of Geography and Geography takes pride every year
in the quality of its graduating seniors. Students graduating from the various
program tracks offered by the Department must pass rigorous course
requirements, satisfy applied skills components, and maintain their overall
GPAs. All this is often in addition to outside employment demands, public
service, family duties, and service to the Department and College. Each year,
the Department recognizes its outstanding seniors at a public presentation by
presenting them with awards and certificates. The recipients of the
Department's highest honors also receive recognition at the University Awards
Ceremony.  
       For the 1998-99 academic year, Johnny Merideth from Munfordville received the Outstanding Geology Senior Award.

# WELCOME NEW FACULTY

### Dr Mace Bentley    ![](macepic.jpg)

####       We are pleased to welcome a new addition to the geography program,
Dr Mace Bentley. Born and raised in Ft. Thomas, KY, Mace graduated with a B.A.
in Geography, second major-Mathematics, from Northern Kentucky University,
earned an M.A. in Geography from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, and
recently earned a Ph.D. in Geography from the University of Georgia in Athens.
His research interests include Synoptic-Dynamic Meteorology/Climatology,
Severe Storms Meteorology, Weather Hazards, and Physical Oceanography.  
       Dr. Bentley's current research involves investigating synoptic environments that are conducive to support-ing derecho-producing mesoscale convective systems (DMCSs). DMCSs are powerful thunderstorm complexes that can travel great distances and produce nearly continuous straight-line wind damage. The severe gust front produced by these thunderstorm complexes is called a derecho. He is also interested in evaluating derechos as a natural hazard by comparing the damage and human costs of these events to tornadoes and hurricanes. Mace also has broader interests in operational meteorology and in research projects aimed at improving weather forecasting. He hopes to get some students involved in several research projects to support these goals.  
       Dr. Bentley's academic experience includes teaching meteorology courses at several universities while in graduate school and serving as a research assistant on NASA-funded research at the University of Georgia. This research project investigated the usefulness of microwave remote sensing for estimating ice melt on the Greenland Ice Sheet. Mace has also worked as a forecast meteorologist at The Weather Channel in Atlanta, Georgia, and at WKRC-TV in Cincinnati, Ohio. This experience not only helped strengthen his meteorological background, but it has also directed his research into solving operational-related forecasting problems.  
       Dr Bentley is very excited about coming to Western. He feels very comfortable with the faculty and is hoping to make a strong contribution to the Department. Mace also is looking forward to his role as Assistant State Climatologist and to working with Glen Conner on maintaining a high quality of research and public service at the Kentucky Climate Center. Challenges ahead include implementation of two high-end servers for data acquisition and archiving, further utilization of students in research projects, and digitizing historical climate records for computer input. In addition, future plans include obtaining funding for developing a meteorological computer laboratory that would be available for both introductory and advanced students focusing on meteorology/climatology. If the Center can secure funding, it will be setting up this lab with the latest meteorological display software and allowing for the processing of real-time data. This will support the meteorological/climatological courses and provide the foundation for additional courses in synoptic and dynamic meteorology.

  

### Jamie Strickland   ![](jamie1.jpg)

####        The faculty are pleased to welcome another new addition to the
geography program, Jamie Strickland. Jamie joined the Geography and Geology
Department in August 1999 and has thoroughly enjoyed moving to the
Commonwealth that has figured so prominently in her research. As a migration
researcher, Ms Strickland appreciates the geographic paths people follow over
their lifetime. A native of Ohio, she moved to Charlotte, North Carolina, as a
high school senior. She pressed farther south in 1994 to pursue her Ph.D.
studies in that alternative music mecca, and home of the Bulldogs, Athens,
Georgia.  
       Ms Strickland received her M.A. in 1993 from the University of North Carolina at Charlotte under the direction of WKU alumni, and former WKU geography professor, Dr Tink Moore. Her thesis focused on the historical geographic dimensions of the settlement school movement in eastern Kentucky. With ready access to the resources of the Kentucky Museum and with study sites in close proximity, she hopes to continue her research into those institutions which have had such an important impact on the social and economic development of Kentucky.  
       Ms Strickland's current research examines the geo-graphic mobility of older people and how that mobility is impacted by employment changes as they age. This research forms the core of her dissertation work under the direction of Dr Kavita Pandit at the University of Georgia. In addition to her research interests, Jamie has a strong commitment to geographic education, for students and future geography teachers alike. While at Georgia, she had the opportunity to organize and teach a training course for graduate teaching assistants.  
       Ms Strickland is actively involved in gerontological as well as Appalachian studies and has presented several papers on these subjects at the annual meetings of SEDAAG and AAG. Her participation in the AAG meeting in Honolulu earlier this year provided her with the unusual opportunity to say, "but I'm going to Hawaii on business, really I am!" In addition to conference participation, Ms Strickland has published an article in the most recent issue of the Southeastern Geographer on the durability of the socio-economic regional boundaries drawn by the Appalachian Regional Commission in eastern Kentucky.  
       Ms Strickland is very excited about her first year at Western and looks forward to a successful academic term. When not in her office in the Environmental Sciences and Technology Building, Jamie can be found scouring used book stores for further additions to her growing collection of vintage geography textbooks and travel guides, which includes a geography text from 1893.

## KISS THE BLARNEY STONE? ... ARE YOU NUTS!

### ![](trapasso.jpg)      Michael Trapasso

  

####         Through the many conversations my friend and I had planning our
trip to Ireland, not once did we mention, not once did we even joke about,
kissing the Blarney Stone. I didn't know where the stone was located and,
frankly, I didn't care. I don't do things for luck, nor do I run from bad
omens. I happen to like black cats! I'm not Irish, and I didn't go to Ireland
to kiss some rock. The story I'm about to unfold, oddly enough, was totally
serendipitous.  
       Our goal was to see as much of Ireland as possible in the time allotted. Time was the enemy; we battled it constantly. The fact that St. Patrick's Day occurred during our trip was simple coincidence. We would not have planned to be in Ireland during its highest-visitation holiday. We hoped this famous day, we both normally enjoy, would not hinder our exploration of the Emerald Isle. As a matter of fact, we tried to use St. Paddy's day to our advantage. With the nation off from work and doing family things, such as church services, reunions, viewing parades, etc., perhaps we could travel the roads, devoid of heavy traffic. So on this day we attempted our north to south cross-country dash. We wanted to visit Cork if we had the time, and this was our shot.  
       Starting around 9:00 a.m. north of Donegal town (in the northern Republic), we started our southward run towards Cork. The day was beautifully sunny, reported as the sunniest St. Patrick's Day in 30 years, and the roads were all but deserted. We drove like crazy. Killybegs to Donegal to Sligo; people were still in church. Galway to Limerick; people were still watching parades. A stop for lunch and photos in Ennis, and we were off again. Through Mallow, and we were on to our final approach to Cork city. It was nearly 4:00 p.m. and we were almost there!  
       Having driven most of the day, our tiny rental car exacted its toll on my spine. I needed to exit that cramped vehicle and stretch a bit. At that point we discussed our game plan. Do we want to drive into a big Irish city on St. Patrick's Day... not knowing where we are... not knowing where to go... while sitting on the wrong side of the car and driving on the wrong side of the road? No!... we'll stop just north of town, secure a B&B;, do some celebrating, then take a bus into Cork the next day. I asked my acting navigator, "Are there any small towns north of Cork?" "Yes, there's one just a few kilometers away," was the response. "What's it called?" I inquired. "Blarney" was the reply. Silence filled the car. I then wondered if Blarney is to Ireland as Peachtree is to Atlanta? Blarney This?... Blarney That?... Blarney The Other? As it turns out, there's only one Blarney.  
       The exit road wound us around and in front of an acceptable B&B.; The lady of the house suggested we explore the town, only a kilometer away. We agreed, but neither one of us asked about The Stone.' Approaching the small town of Blarney, signs directed traffic to the castle. I must explain that castles are my passion; I explore them, I photograph them, I love them. It was decided, the remainder of the daylight would be spent on Blarney Castle. A few punts (Irish dollars), and through the turnstile we went. I shot photos of every room and every angle. I loved the old ruins. What a magnificent structure it was. At the very top of the castle wall I shot film through the same crenellations which shielded archers and gunners through time. Looking down four stories of height I tried to imagine the battles that might have taken place around this seemingly impregnable fortress. One had to be careful, however, when walking the outer perimeter of the battlements, for there were several murder holes.' A murder hole is a hole through the floor that leads out of the castle. From there defenders could pour boiling pitch, throw stones, spears or anything to kill or otherwise deter attackers. Fortunately, all the murder holes had two safety bars across the openings so that if a person falls into the hole, undoubtedly a painful fall, they would not fall through the hole and plummet more than 80 feet to certain death, the latter being very bad publicity for Irish tourism.  
       There were murder holes a few feet apart around the periphery of the castle wall. While shooting various angles and carefully stepping around these deadly gaps, I spotted a male attendant standing by one wall. We were alone, so I finally broke down and asked him where the Blarney Stone might be. "There it is," as he pointed to a stone built into the wall. "That's it?!" I exclaimed. I never knew what this thing looked like, its size, its shape. I imagined it set aside like a shrine, perhaps in a special cave, perhaps with a statue of a saint close by. But this was a stone in a wall. Though irregularly shaped, it was not too much bigger than a football in width. Supposedly it is around four feet long, but the length was incorporated into the wall's thickness. There was a distinctive stain where countless lips had kissed this chunk of limestone... lip balm, lipstick, greasy lips, and who knows what else may have created that stain.   
       "So what is it, and why do people kiss it?" I inquired. He explained it was a holy relic, brought back from one of the crusades. He couldn't elaborate on the origin, but he went on to extoll that kissing it would bring good luck and the gift of Irish eloquence. Looking at the thing and its obvious stain, I pondered, "So now what? Am I supposed to kiss that thing?" The internal debate began. I thought, "As a professor and a lecturer, I suppose a little extra eloquence couldn't hurt. On the other hand, how many germs can live on an exposed rock surface? By the same token, as a geographer and an explorer, I've happened upon the right place at the right time. However, are there pathogens that can survive harsh atmospheric conditions?" Enough was enough; my conclusion was reached. I am a bit of a daredevil, and I rarely turn down a challenge. So, I pulled a punt from my pocket, the cost of the experience, and called to the guide.  
       To complicate matters, the Blarney Stone is very low on the wall and it lies on the opposite side of a murder hole! How does one kiss this part of the wall without falling into the hole? Thus, the ritual began. The guide asked me to remove my hat and sun glasses, as they certainly would fall through the hole. He then rolled out a clear plastic carpet runner and laid it out from the edge of the hole. On top he laid a nondescript piece of carpet. He asked me to sit on the edge of the carpet with my back to the murder hole. As I was positioning myself, my friend offered to snap a photo, and declared, "I'm not going to try it!" The attendant sat beside me with his feet braced against the wall and his arm around my waist. "Lean backward and grab the bars with your hands," he said. There were two parallel iron bars vertically attached to the wall one on each side of the stone. With a firm gripping one could use one's hands to slowly lower oneself farther and farther backward over the hole. "Slowly...slowly...a little more," the guide encouraged.  
       My face was only inches from this ancient stone block wall. I could feel my back arching, and my neck stretching. "A little lower... a little lower." he kept on. At that point I could feel my center of gravity shifting, more of my body mass was over the hole and my legs were starting to rise in the air as if to fall in backwards! But, the guide was there to hold me in place, and that he did. "A little farther...just one more stone." Then I saw it, face to face, with that distinctive stain. I reached out and kissed it. Just then I heard my friend exclaim, "No, no! I didn't get it... do it again!" Stretching my neck for a second kiss, I heard the shutter release on my camera and it was over. I slowly used my hands to climb up the iron bars until I was almost sitting up. One good yank around the waist from the guide and I was sitting safely on the carpet once again.   
       A funny thing happenedthe long hours of driving that day had caused a slight misalignment in my spine. While bending over backwards to kiss the Blarney stone, I felt a distinctive pop, and my spine was back in place! My back felt better AFTER the kiss. We all laughed about how quickly the good luck begins. Descending the castle's spiral staircase, I wiped my shirt sleeve across my lips several times and thought, a serious St. Patrick's Day drink may kill any pathogens I might have just acquired. I was then informed that in an earlier conversation with my friend, the guide admitted it was his first day on the job. I was in the hands of a recent trainee! Alcohol was definately in order, and this was the day for it. We found a lively pub and drink we did.  
       The next day, a short bus ride brought us to the city of Cork for another glorious day of exploration and photography. Before departing, we stopped at a pub on the River Lee and enjoyed another pint of fine Irish stout. As we were leaving the pub, two older gentlemen, who had obviously been drinking for quite some time, approached us at the door, "Are you having a fine time in Ireland?" the heavy set man asked. "Yes, it's been great," I replied. "Did ye go to the Castle?" "Yes we did, yesterday." "Did ye kiss the Stone, did ye?" My friend replied, "I didn't, but he did," pointing to me. The kindly pie-eyed gentleman looked at me and asked, "Did ye now?" I resounded with pride, "Yes I did!" He smiled as he lifted his glass to me and said, "then a true Paddy you are!" He drank to me. I didn't have the heart to tell him I was Italian. I thanked him for his sentiment, and shook his hand before leaving.  
       That incident made my day. I had a lovely day in Cork, I won the respect of a few local residents, and I was proud of my achievement. Maybe there was a bit of luck in that rock, after all!

## Landscape Changes in England

### ![](djkags.jpg)       [ David J.
Keeling](http://www.wku.edu/~keelidj/index.htm)

####        England conjures up a variety of images in the minds of most
people: castles and queens; fish and chips; rolling green fields and misty
moors; the narrow streets of London and the industrial canals of Manchester;
and cricket and Wimbledon tennis. One of the most striking images of England,
however, is the contrast between the economically prosperous southeast region
dominated by London and the economically depressed industrial towns and cities
of the Midlands and northeastern regions. For two months this past summer, I
traveled the length and breadth of the United Kingdom in order to understand
more clearly how the landscapes of England have changed in recent decades.  
       The Industrial Revolution changed the geography of England in profound ways. From the end of the 18th century until the late 1960s, industrial and urban growth transformed the landscapes of middle England, with huge cities emerging from the roots of rural villages. Manchester, Sheffield, Liverpool, Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle..... the roll-call of great industrial centers highlights how much Britain's global dominance rested on the productivity of cities.   
       However, by the end of the 1960s, the industrial landscape had deteriorated badly. Coupled with the scars still remaining from World War II bombing, the global shift in industrial production to the peripheral regions of Asia and Latin America left these once proud cities of England in serious decay. In comparison, the southeastern region centered on London had prospered nicely since 1945, in part as a consequence of London's role as a financial center in the emerging post-industrial global economy.  
      One of the most notable changes has been in the housing market. The industrial terrace houses made famous by Britain's longest-running television program, Coronation Street, have fallen on hard times. Property prices have collapsed and the privatization of government-owned "council" houses introduced by the Thatcher government in the late 1980s has not met with the type of success envisioned by local authorities. Rows upon rows of boarded-up windows and doors now greet residents and visitors alike in what once were vibrant neighborhoods. A typical terraced house in a declining neighborhood barely fetches 10,000 pounds today, whereas similar houses in the southeastern region regularly sell for ten times that amount.  
       During the period of high economic growth in the early 1990s in England, the region surrounding London in the southeast experienced a property boom that pushed prices through the roof. Although prices have stabilized and even dropped in some areas, the average family home in the southeast still sells for over 100,000 pounds, which is dramatically higher than the average home price in the old industrial core.  
       Other noticable changes on the landscape include the construction of new infrastructure and buildings associated with the financial and service components of the global economy. Although London has seen the lion's share of this construction, former industrial cities such as Manchester, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Leeds have not gone untouched. In Manchester, major construction in the downtown core is in the process of transforming a somewhat shabby area into a world-class business and shopping center. A light-rail system introduced several years ago has helped to improve accessibility and mobility throughout the city.   
       In Sheffield, the former industrial Don River Valley has been cleaned up and transformed into a more productive and environmentally healthier area. Birmingham has benefitted from the rehabilitation of its urban canal system, with shops, restaurants, hotels, business towers, and apartment complexes replacing run-down warehouses and dock buildings. Other cities such as Newcastle and Glasgow have enjoyed the aesthetic impacts of new and rehabilitated infrastructure and buildings.   
       Despite these positive improvements to the former industrial landscapes, however, the central region of England continues to lag socially and economically behind the southeast region. Unemployment, crime, quality of life, and economic opportunity are all worse in the old industrial core than in the booming southeast. As a result, outmigration continues to deplete the populations of smaller towns and villages as young people seek opportunity and the "bright lights of the big city" to the south.  
       London has emerged at the end of the 20th century as one of three keystone cities in the global economy (along with New York and Tokyo). Its importance as a financial, cultural, and political center has attracted global capital and transnational entrepreneurs, who in turn have helped to alter the urban landscape. The most significant restructuring has occurred in the eastern section of London between St. Paul's Cathedral, the City (financial district), and the Isle of Dogs. These three areas are linked by the fully automated Docklands Light Railway (currently being extended across the Thames River to Greenwich and Lewisham), which has helped to transform land use. The historic financial center of London (The City) is undergoing a new round of construction as office towers mushroom on the skyline to complement existing structures such as the Natwest Tower and the architecturally stunning Lloyds Insurance building.   
       In and around the Isle of Dogs, construction has begun once again on office towers, retail centers, and residential complexes after the financial collapse in the early 1990s of Olympia and York, the real estate company that funded initial investments in the Canary Wharf project. Across the Thames in Greenwich, the Millennium Dome dominates the skyline and construction is underway on a variety of commercial and retail projects. Further upstream, opposite St. Paul's Cathedral, a new footbridge across the Thames is under construction, designed to link the area around St. Paul's with the Southbank district. Anchored by the recently opened Shakespeare's Globe Theater near the famous Tower Bridge, the entire stretch of river east towards Greenwich has undergone renovation to attract tourists and Londoners alike to the delights of the traditional East End neighborhoods of London.  
       From world-class cities to industrial slums, England offers incredible contrasts in geography, history, architecture, and culture. The task for planners and policy makers is to ensure that the country's oasis of development does not become surrounded by a sea of turbulent poverty and dissatisfaction. Indications so far show that Britain's government has not developed any long-term policies to address these spatial inequities.

# More Faculty Adventures...

## A Journey to China

### ![](fish.jpg)   by Michael May

####       This past spring, I had the wonderful opportunity to join five
other Western faculty members on a most enjoyable two-week trip into China.
This was the first ever Faculty Development Seminar abroad where faculty from
various colleges traveled together as part of the collaboration between
Western and the People's Education Press (PRP) in Beijing. The PRP is
interested in cultivating exchanges between educators in various countries and
in having discussions on various educational issues including pedagogical
topics, content topics, and trends in the People's Republic relative to global
changes in education and business.  
       The first portion of my trip was perhaps the most interesting relative to global politics. We left Bowling Green on Mother's Day, the same weekend that NATO forces managed to bomb the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, killing several Chinese. Enroute to Beijing from Detroit we discussed how we might be perceived or treated by the Chinese since CNN and other media were already broadcasting anti-American and anti-NATO student demonstrations in Beijing. The local Bowling Green TV and newspapers were apparently trying to convey that the traveling group from Western might be in "harms way." Several other state universities from Kentucky were also sending delegations of people to China at that time and, after a U.S. State Department warning for American travelers was issued, some of these folks were called back by their administrators. I am quite thankful that the administration at Western fully supported us continuing our trip.  
       It was obvious to us all that a senator from Kentucky and numerous other politicians were thinking that CNN broadcasts of student demonstrators and a warning from the U.S. State Department were indeed representative of "breaking all diplomatic ties with the U.S." This was not true and as far as individuals and universities that we were to visit, we were still going to be well-treated guests! I learned that the media is in the business of selling dramatic stories and not necessarily the truth.  
       We joked several times as the first week progressed during numerous 12- and 13-course meals that we were all having another helping of "harms way." Student demonstrations at the U.S. Embassy were apparently staged by the Government for Western T.V. viewers and lasted only about three days. We felt safe walking the streets at night and everyone we met on the streets, in stores, and in restaurants, etc., was quite welcoming.  
       Other exciting sites visted in Beijing included the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace, and the Ming Tombs. Words cannot describe the art and architecture at any of these sites. The Forbidden City is really a city within a city. China is famous for walled compounds within walled compounds, and the Forbidden City is but one spectacular example. I found the carved marble railings, banisters, steps, and ramp ways to be remarkable. Since marble is a metamorphic rock found in mountain belts and not present in Beijing, it had to be brought in from about 75 to 100 miles away. One particularly large carved marble piece (over 80 feet long) was dragged over 75 miles by the Imperial workforce (note that this is why a college education is useful). How did they do that? They dug a well every half a mile along the transport route and, in the winter, drew water from each well and spread it on the pathway over which the stone slab was to be moved. This action created a nearly frictionless ice highway. Talk about labor-intensive work!  
       In addition to visiting Beijing and environs we traveled via air to Xi'an, the ancient capital of China. On the flight over the highly dissected loess plateau and Yellow River areas, and in Xi'an, the importance of loess was readily apparent. This wind-blown silt and clay blown in from the Gobi Desert creates particulate "pollution" giving the sky a dusty or hazy look, but it is also responsible for renewing the nutrients in agricultural regions. Some Chinese have dug into the loess and have created cliff-side housing units. These housing units are not earthquake proof unfortunately.  
       In Xi'an, a city of six million people, we were immersed in Chinese history for three days: prehistory, all the Dynasties, religions, cultural diversity, ethnic diversity, etc. What a place -- 8th-century pagodas, mountain views, and world famous art and archeological museums. One of the most exciting places to visit was the Terra Cotta Warriors Museum and Archaeological site. The experience of viewing "the most significant archeological find in the 20th century" proved surreal. We gazed with awe onto detailed, life-size pottery figures (and, of course, they gazed back, as they have for 2000 years). All of these works of art were standing in place in loess deposits, guarding the emperor's tomb.   
       Another highlight of the Xi'an area was going up into the Qinling Mountains, considered one of the eight great sites in central Shaanxi Province in central China. These mountains are tectonically a boundary between two of the great tectonic plates making up the central part of China. Lots of faults and associated silver, gold and other metallic minerals are common in this area. On our trek up into the mountains we saw beautifully terraced fields in loess deposits in the foothills and quaint villages along the road ways. Here too in the countryside it is obvious that the Chinese are building, and expanding, new roads, new housing, and cable lifts for tourists, etc.  
       Our two weeks abroad were all too short and we all enjoyed seeing first hand the economic expansion of this part of Asia, the food, the drink, and the friendship. I certainly would like to go back again. If you are interested in finding out more about my, and other, faculty experiences in China please point your browser to Dr. Jane Olmstead's [ web page](http://www.wku.edu/~olmstji/chinajournal.html). She has many photographs of our trip on line and a nice journal of our travels.

# GEOLOGY IN THE NEWS

## Pound Gap Roadcut: Kentucky's First "Distinguished Geologic Site"

### by Ken Kuehn

####        In 1998, the Kentucky Society of Professional Geologists (KSPG)
launched its "Distinguished Geologic Site" program. The goals of this program
are to provide formal recognition of Kentucky's rich geologic heri-tage and to
increase the awareness of its citizens about that heritage. With support from
various levels of state government, the first site was officially designated
on September 26 in a ceremony held in the town of Jenkins, Letcher County,
Kentucky. Amid the bustle of media coverage, Mayor Robert Shubert eloquently
accepted a special plaque from KSPG President Dr. Don Chesnut of the Kentucky
Geological Survey.  
       The extraordinary Pound Gap Roadcut is the result of constructing a 2.7 mile bypass on US Rt. 23 near Jenkins, which links the states of Kentucky and Virginia. Earlier that week, Governor Paul Patton had visited the site in order to open officially the new highway. This short stretch of road, constucted at a total cost of about $53 million, represents the most expensive state-supervised highway project in Kentucky's history!  
       For geologists in particular, however, this new highway offers one of the most remarkable exposures of rock in the entire eastern United States! The Pound Gap Roadcut exposes Late Devonian through Early Pennsylvanian sedimentary rocks that usually lie far below the surface in that region. Thanks to the famous Paleozoic thrust faulting on Pine Mountain and the recent good work by the KY Department of Transportation in removing approximately 9 million cubic yards of material, it is now possible to view in detail more than 2,000 feet of continuous stratigraphic section. These rock layers reveal a fascinating story of advancing and retreating seas, swamps and coal deposits, and the building of the Appalachian Mountains.  
       Natural gaps through the mountains always have been important to the story of Kentucky's history and development, with the famous Cumberland Gap being the most widely noted. The new US Rt. 23 bypass through Pound Gap will be no exception. Not only will the highway bring much needed commerce and tourism into the region, but a permanent Welcome Center being constructed there will feature graphical displays and explanatory materials so the general public can better appreciate the geologic uniqueness and importance of this locale. (Also, especially for geologists, a descriptive field guide for the site can be obtained by contacting the Kentucky Geological Survey.)  
       The KSPG's "Distinguished Geologic Site" program is an on-going one. It seeks to bring Kentucky's outstanding geology the public recognition it deserves. Do you wish to nominate a site? You can learn more about this significant program, including its nomination and selection criteria, by contacting Dr. Ken Kuehn at (270)745-3082 or [kenneth.kuehn@wku.edu.](mailto:kenneth.kuehn@wku.edu)

# FACULTY ACTIVITIES

#### ![](http://www.wku.edu/geoweb/book.gif)_JAMES M. BINGHAM_ reports that
when he is at a loss to find words that seem appropriate for the occasion, he
frequently turns to a favorite poet for support. He offers the following in
memory of a fellow geographer and friend, WAYNE L. HOFFMAN (1937-1999).

  

##### To him who in the love of Nature holds  
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks  
A various language; for his gayer hours  
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile  
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides  
Into his darker musings, with a mild  
And healing sympathy, ere he is aware.  
When thoughts Of the last bitter hour come like a blight  
Over thy spirit, and sad images  
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,  
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,  
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--  
Go forth, under the open sky, and list  
To Nature's teachings, while from all around--  
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air--  
Comes a still voice--Yet a few days, and thee  
The all-beholding sun shall see no more  
In all his course; not yet in the cold ground,  
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,  
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist  
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim  
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,  
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up  
Thine individual being, shalt thou go  
To mix for ever with the elements,  
To be a brother to the insensible rock  
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain  
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak  
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.  
Yet not to thine eternal resting-place  
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish  
Couch more magnificient. Thou shalt lie down  
With patriarchs of the infant world--with kings,  
The powerful of the earth--the wise, the good  
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,  
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills  
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,--the vales  
Stretching in pensive quietness between;  
The venerable woods--rivers that move  
In majesty, and the complaining brooks  
That make the meadow green; and, poured round all,  
Old Ocean's gray and melancholy waste,--  
Are but the solemn decorations all  
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,  
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,  
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,  
Through the still laspe of ages. All that tread  
The globe are but a handful to the tribes  
That slumber it its bosom.--Take the wings  
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,  
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods  
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound  
Save his own dashings--yet the dead are there:  
And millions in those solitudes, since first  
The flight of years began, have laid them down  
In their last sleep--the dead reign there alone.  
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw  
In silence from the living, and no friend  
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe  
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh  
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care  
Plod on, and each one as before will chase  
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave  
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come  
And make their bed with thee. As the long train  
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,  
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes  
In full strength of years, matron and maid,  
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man--  
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side  
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.  
So live that when thy summons come to join  
The innumerable caravan, which moves  
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take  
His chamber in the silent halls of death,  
Thou go not, like a quarry-slave at night,  
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed  
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,  
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch  
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

#### THANATOPSIS by William Cullen Bryant  
"PLEASANT DREAMS," BOSS.

#### ![](http://www.wku.edu/geoweb/book.gif)     _GLEN CONNER_ reports that
many of his activities this past year were related to the selection of the
Kentucky Climate Center as a part of WKU's Program of Distinction. In 1998,
the Kentucky Council on Postsecondary Education selected the Applied Research
and Technology program from Western Kentucky University for designation as a
Program of Distinction. This program links ten Ogden College centers to assist
the Commonwealth in meeting the research and technical needs of the community,
state and nation; providing multidisciplinary scientific and technical
assistance for industrial and environmental problems; and providing
undergraduate and graduate students with hands-on research opportunities as an
integrated part of their academic program. The Kentucky Climate Center is one
of those ten centers and, in that role, eight undergraduate students and one
graduate student were employed during the year. Two students were programmers,
one was an administrative assistant, and the other five were research
assistants. Of the undergraduate research assistants, one conducted an
analysis of the record-breaking flash flood of 1969 in Allen County, one
looked at the occurrence of tornadoes in Kentucky during La Niqa periods, and
three worked to create a new electronic data set of Kentucky's weather records
prior to 1896. The graduate student is examining the distribution of hourly
rainfall in Kentucky.  
       The Program of Distinction has provided about $60,000 in added equipment for the Kentucky Climate Center, including a server for web activities, computers, printers, a scanner, a CD ROM writer, and mapping programs. Much of these added capabilities will be available for the Department's use as well.  
       Glen was selected to participate in the National Climatic Data Center's State Climatologist Exchange Program. The first nine days of July 1998 were the last of his three-week tenure in Asheville, North Carolina. During this period, he did research on Kentucky climate-station histories. He also worked on improving the Kentucky Climate Center's Worldwide Web homepage and added 17 Fact Sheets about Kentucky's climate to that web site.  
       Glen remains active in professional organizations. The President of the American Meteorological Society appointed him to the AMS nine-member Applied Climatology Committee. Among other things, the committee is responsible for organizing and conducting an annual applied climatology conference. He was elected Vice President of the Kentucky-Indiana Chapter of the American Meteorological Society in November, 1998, and in February, 1999, he was elected to serve on the Advisory Panel to the Midwestern Climate Center. This panel's purpose is similar to that of our Program of Distinction's Advisory Council.  
       He wrote a research article, _A Rose by any other Number_ , that was accepted for publication in the National Climatic Data Center's _State Climatologist Journal_. The paper describes the origin and evolution of index numbers for climate stations that are used instead of names. Glen co-authored a paper, _An Expanded Digital Daily Database_ , for Climatic Resources Applications in the Midwestern United States with Kenneth Kunkel and other Midwestern State Climatologists that was published in the _Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society_ , Volume 79 (7), July 1998, pp. 1357-66. In January 1999, he presented a paper _The Relationship Between Record Daily Temperature Extremes And Annual Mean Temperature_ , co-authored with Scott Richter and Barry Brunson from WKU's Mathematics Department, to the American Meteorological Society's Eleventh Conference on Applied Climatology in Dallas. That paper was published in the Conference Preprints on pages 196-200. The thrust of the paper was that all-time daily record temperature extremes are artifacts of climate and can reveal trends in the national mean temperature. He presented a paper _What a Tangled Web_ to the Geography Section of the Kentucky Academy of Science in Louisville in November 1998. The paper presented lessons learned from the use of the Web in Geography 100 courses at WKU during the past two years. Glen also sponsored two student papers at the Sigma Xi Research Conference at Western Kentucky University in April 1999. The undergraduate paper was _Analysis of the Scottsville, Kentucky Flash Flood, 1969_ by Megan Smith and the graduate paper was _Influences on Temperature in Kentucky_ by Kevin Cary.  
       Glen received funding of $7,592 from the Midwestern Climate Center for the development of new electronic data sets. Western Kentucky University contributed cost sharing worth $1,208. The project is to digitize Kentucky's climate observations from 1896 back to the earliest made in 1825. Although the funding was for just one year, it will be renewed for each of the next two years.  
       During the past year, the Kentucky Climate Center fulfilled hundreds of telephone requests and numerous e-mail or fax requests for data. In addition, the Kentucky Climate Center's Web page was accessed 7176 times. All of these uses comprise the public service role of the Center. There continues to be a wide variety of users of climatic data that include business, industry, commercial activities, all levels of government, consultants, legal, insurance, etc.  
  

#### ![](http://www.wku.edu/geoweb/book.gif)    _NICHOLAS CRAWFORD_ has had an
extremely productive year as director of the Center for Cave and Karst
Studies. As part of the Ogden College Applied Research and Technology Program
of Distinction, the Center has been positioning itself to play a larger role
in national cave research. The primary foci for Dr Crawford this year have
been research with micro-gravity and resistivity, the Mammoth Cave Field
Studies program, and restoration of Lost River Cave. Through the Program of
Distinction, the Center for Cave and Karst Studies was able to hire Alan
Glennon as a full-time research hydrologist.  
       The City of Bowling Green has contracted Dr Crawford to help alleviate flooding problems in the city's karst environment. For the task, the center has acquired a microgravity meter and resistivity meter, which are precision instruments for the detection of caves from the surface. The next big discoveries in applied karst research will be in the surface detection of subterranean cavities and the Center for Cave and Karst Studies is positioned to be in the forefront of this research. Dr Crawford attended and presented at national conferences in Minnesota, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee to address these topics of research. Two undergraduate students were hired to support the microgravity project and a dozen more students have participated in the project's other hydrogeologic work

Course Description  
As white Americans proceeded to define and construct their new nation in the
19th century, they continued a process they had initiated as colonists,
settling a "New World," and transforming its landscape, which had previously
been molded by American Indians. Simultaneously, that landscape, natural and
colonial, profoundly affected postcolonial United States. This course examines
the complex dialogue-material and discursive-between nature and culture in the
United States during the 19th century. It will focus on the complicated links
between material circumstances, mentality, ideology, and power, which affected
the physical context of the American environment and the changing experience
of American life.

And that context and experience changed dramatically, as the 19th century saw
the continental expansion of the United States, a transportation revolution,
the advent of a national market economy, industrialization, astonishing
population growth and urbanization, and the emergence of unprecedented
environmental problems, including exhaustion of natural resources and
deterioration of quality of life in American cities.

Readings, lectures, and discussions will consider the following topics: Native
American cultures and ecology in the age of western expansion; American
slavery and its landscape of exploitation; white Americans' confrontations
with the western landscape and the ideas of "nature," "wilderness,"
"frontier," and "progress"; American agriculture, industry, and urbanization,
and vital links between the city and countryside; recognition of and early
responses to the problems of urban pollution; cultural and scientific trends
and their relation to the exploitation, appreciation, conservation, or
preservation of the American landscape.

Format and Requirements  
This course will combine lecture with discussion, often weaving the two
together to make class sessions interactive. Lectures will generally build
upon, not simply recapitulate, readings. Students are responsible for
completing reading and written assignments by the time indicated on the
syllabus. These assignments will often provide the basis for class activity;
students are expected to attend all class meetings and participate actively.
Except in extraordinary circumstances, no work will be accepted late. Students
must complete all assignments in order to pass the course. Grades will be
assigned according to students' performance on the following:

  * quality of class participation (25%).
  * 10 short (approx. 500 words) essays (one per week) (75%). 
  * There will be no exams. 

Academic integrity is important. I will hold all students to the UO "Standards
of Conduct." Plagiarism will not be tolerated; all work must be your own,
written for this class.

Unit One: Early National Landscape

What do we mean when we speak of the "American environment"? What is it? Where
is it? Does it have a history? This unit will begin with these basic questions
and investigate the early national period, when the United States was being
invented, not just politically but spatially and materially. What was the
environmental impact of the American Revolution and Independence? How did
Americans shape their natural environment in accordance with their political,
social, and economic dreams? How did that environment offer opportunities and
constraints?

Essay Assignment: Late colonial and early national America was understood to
be a land of opportunity. Who (generally) was able to realize that
opportunity? How was that economic opportunity based in America's natural
environment? Draw on the assigned reading in _Major Problems_ , and write a
short essay (no more than 500 words-about two typed, double-spaced pages) that
assesses how the American environment contributed to economic opportunity for
some (perhaps at the expense of others). Due in class Thursday, January 10.  
[Remember: this is an essay, not a research paper. Analyze your sources and
make (and support) a particular point in response to the question; do not
expect to be comprehensive-you have only two pages.]

Unit Two: Commerce and Industrialization

The formation of the United States unleashed tremendous economic energy.
Beginning in the 1790 and accelerating in the 19th century, the economy
expanded and was transformed as the country itself grew. A national market
economy emerged, tied together by a transportation network, the result of a
transportation revolution in the early national period. The economy
increasingly featured new forms of manufacturing and industrial organization,
which altered the nature and quality of people's experience, their conceptions
of place and space, and their impact on their physical worlds.

Wealth in the United States grew astoundingly, and for many the standard of
living rose steadily. Yet these benefits were accompanied by costs--for some,
dislocation, decline in status, increasing dependency; for the natural
environment, degradation, exhaustion of resources, pollution. Why and how did
the United States favor the economic, social, legal, and political innovations
that underwrote early commercial and industrial development? What was the
environmental impact of such development? The answers, of course, are
complicated. We seek them in this unit's readings and discussions.  
  
Week 3

January 22 (Tu)--Market Revolution and Economic Development.  
Reading: Steinberg, _Nature Incorporated_ , 1-95.

January 24 (Th)--Early Industrialization of New England.  
Reading: Steinberg, _Nature Incorporated_ , 99-165.

Essay Assignment: The famous English jurist William Blackstone wrote in 18th
century: "water is a moveable, wandering thing, and must of necessity continue
common by the law of nature; so that [one] can only have a temporary,
transient, usufructuary property therein." Write a 500-word essay that
explains how early American industrialists successfully challenged such a
common law understanding. How and why were they able to assert new property
rights to water, which seem at odds with democratic values? What are the
environmental implications of this development? Due in class January 24.

Week 4

January 29 (Tu)--Depleted and Fouled Waters.  
Reading: Steinberg, _Nature Incorporated_ , 166-239. "[Pollution of the Nashua
River](hst473_pollution.htm)," 1877.

January 31 (Th)--Triumph of American Industrialization.  
Reading: Steinberg, _Nature Incorporated_ , 243-71.

Essay Assignment: Despite some notable exceptions, most Americans continued to
support industrial development and seemed largely unconcerned by real and
potential environmental problems. Write an essay (approximately 500 words)
that assesses Americans' commitment to "progress" through the control,
manipulation, and exploitation of the environment. Due in class January 31.

Unit Three: Westward Expansion: Conquest, Extraction, Transformation

Before the American Revolution, white Americans were largely confined to the
Atlantic coastal plain and piedmont. The successful formation of the United
States inaugurated an unprecedented westward expansion. By 1830, about 3
million people--more than quarter of U.S. population--lived west of
Appalachians; by 1840, over 5 million, or more than one-third of U.S.
population. By 1860, the United States possessed all of the territory that
later formed the 48 contiguous states; about half of the nation's 31.4 million
people west of Appalachian mountains. Why did such expansion occur? Was it
inevitable, a function of some "manifest destiny"? What were the consequences
--human and environmental--not merely in the West but in the East, not merely
in the countryside but in cities? This unit will examine the geographic
expansion of the United States, its causes, and its human and environmental
impacts.  
  
---|---  
  
Week 5

February 5 (Tu)--an "Empire of Liberty"? The West as Destiny and Ideology.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 247-85.

February 7 (Th)--Winning and Losing the Trans-Mississippi West.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 286-323, 345-47.

Essay Assignment (revised): in a short essay (approximately 500 words), place
the Homestead Act of 1862 in historical perspective. Specifically, how did the
Act reflect or enhance prevailing U.S. attitudes toward the environment and
westward expansion? Due in class February 7.

Week 6

February 12 (Tu)--"Natural Resources," Extraction, and Exhaustion.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 338-50.

February 14 (Th)--Oregon and the Northwest.  
Reading: Robert Bunting, _The Pacific Raincoast: Environment and Culture in an
American Eden, 1778-1900_ (Lawrence: University of Kansas Press, 1997),
"Transforming the Forests," 135-58. This selection is on [
e-reserve](http://janus.uoregon.edu/search/p?SEARCH=dennis+m) .

Essay Assignment: in an essay of approximately 500 words, provide an
historical analysis of the concept "natural resource." Define the term and
assess 19th-century Americans' understanding of it, particularly through an
analysis of how they treated the environments of the American West. Did
Americans show concern over potential environmental limits or exhaustion of
resources? Why or why not? Due in class February 14.

Unit Four: Nature's Metropolis

Environmental history too often in the past has neglected urban areas,
focusing instead on wilderness. Yet cityscape is as essential as wild
landscape in the environmental history of the United States, particularly
because the two are intricately related. Westward expansion proceeded not to
sever connections with the East and its commercialized and increasingly
industrialized environment but to extend such connections, bringing new
regions into a larger, national economic arena. This unit will use William
Cronon's work on Chicago and its emergence as a center for a Great West
periphery as a case study to explore the environmental implications and
consequences of urban development in 19th-century America.  
  
---|---  
  
Week 7

February 19 (Tu)--19th-Century Urban Landscapes.  
Reading: Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_ , 1-93.

February 21 (Th)--Chicago and the Great West.  
Reading: Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_ , 97-259.

Essay Assignment: In an essay of approximately 500 words, assess the relation
between Chicago and its hinterlands and the impact of that relationship on the
mid-continental landscape and economy. To focus your essay, concentrate on one
of the following commodities: grain, lumber, or meat. Due in class February
21.

Week 8

February 26 (Tu)--Urban Environmental Problems: Smoke, Waste, Pollution,
Health.  
Reading: Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_ , 263-369.

February 28 (Th)--Urban Reform and its Limits.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 414-42.

Essay Assignment: In an essay of approximately 500 words, assess the
environmental problems of late 19th-century American cities, how such problems
were addressed, and the success or limitations of solutions proposed and
adopted. Due in class February 28.

Unit Five: Nature, Science, and Conservation

![](oxbow.jpeg.jpg)

In this unit, we look more broadly at American culture and its dialogue with
nature in the 19th century. How did Americans understand their natural world
and regard the transformations that economic development wrought? Was America
"Nature's Nation"? If it was a new Eden, what were the implications of
introducing machines into this Garden? If most Americans expressed enthusiasm
for economic development and environmental transformation, did any articulate
concern or anxiety? Here we study a 19th-century minority opinion-that Nature
might have some intrinsic value, that it might merit conservation, even
preservation. Through an examination of art and literature, especially
American landscape painting and the writings of Emerson, Thoreau, Muir and
others, we will trace the origins of American environmentalism-itself a
complex, changing, sometimes amorphous phenomenon.

Week 9

March 5 (Tu)--Nature's Nation.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 170-208; Thoreau, _Walden_ , 1-54 ("Economy").

March 7 (Th)--Machine in the Garden.  
Reading: Thoreau, _Walden_ , 55-67 ("Where I Lived, and What I Lived For"),
75-134 ("Sounds," "Solitude," "Visitors," "The Bean-Field," "The Village,"
"The Ponds").

Essay Assignment: In an essay of approximately 500 words, assess Thoreau's
critique of 19th-century American economic culture. Due in class March 7.

Week 10

March 12 (Tu)--Nature and Science.  
Reading: Thoreau, _Walden_ , 140-49 ("Higher Laws"), 170-223 ("Former
Inhabitants; and Winter Visitors," "Winter Animals," "The Pond in Winter,"
"Spring," "Conclusion"); _Major Problems_ , 338-42 (review).

March 14 (Th)--Conservation and Preservation.  
Reading: _Major Problems_ , 347-59, 383-412; Cronon, _Nature's Metropolis_ ,
371-85.

Essay Assignment: Although we often understand "natural" areas (both urban and
wilderness parks, for example) as residual--places which have escaped the
clutches of economic development--recent scholars have begun to see such
places as the creations of urban people, as cultural constructions produced by
and in reaction to industrialization and urbanization. In an essay of
approximately 500 words, analyze this notion for the second half of the 19th
century. Due in class March 14.

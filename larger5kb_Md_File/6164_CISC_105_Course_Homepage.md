### Course Description & General Information

This course is the introductory computer programming course for non-CISC
majors. The student completing this course should be comfortable working
interactively with a computer and have a general knowledge of the components
of a computer system. In addition, the student will learn the fundamentals of
algorithm design and algorithm implementation. This course is also appropriate
for those considering a CISC major, but are not ready for CISC 181. **Note
that this is a PROGRAMMING course; although no prior programming knowledge is
assumed, it is important to know this is NOT a course in computer literacy or
the use of application software. Significant work outside of class, writing
and debugging programs, is expected and required. This can be a difficult and
time-consuming task.**

### Course Requirements and Grading

| Final Exam| 30%  
---|---  
Midterm Exam| 20%  
Programming Projects| 30%  
Lab and Homework Assignments| 20%  
  
**Exams -** There will be a midterm exam and a final exam. The final exam is
comprehensive and will cover all of the material covered in class.

**Lab Assignments -** Lab assignments will be started, and in some cases
completed, during the scheduled lab classes. Normally, each assignment is due
by the beginning of your next lab class. Most labs involve writing or
modifying C programs. Each lab will focus on a particular concept discussed in
the text or in class, and helps you to complete the programming assignments.

**Homework Assignments -** Homework assignments consist of exercises designed
to give you practice in applying information covered in the text or in class.
Homeworks usually do not require the use of a computer, although frequently a
computer can be used to check your answers. Homeworks will be handed out in
class, and are due at the beginning of the next calendar week's lab session.

**Programming Assignments -** Programming assignments consist of applying
several of the concepts from labs and classes. You must write your own
computer program that will be compiled, tested and debugged. There will be
three programming assignments throughout the course. You will be given 2-3
weeks to complete each programming assignment. Program grades are based on
program design, correct execution, appropriate comments, properly formatted
output, and proper program style.

### Course Policies

**Attendance -** Attendance at lectures and labs is required. Poor attendance
almost always results in poor performance. Exams missed because of excused
absences will be handled at the instructor's discretion. Any absence on the
day of an exam must be pre-approved by the instructor, A MINIMUM OF THREE DAYS
PRIOR TO THE EXAM. In the event of an unexcused absence, a score of zero will
be given on that exam; this includes any absence that has not been pre-
approved by the instructor. The decision to excuse an absence is made solely
by the instructor.

**Late Submission of Assignments -** An assignment's due date will be clealy
specified when the assignment is made. Late assignments will be penalized
unless an extension is granted by the instructor. Note that only the
instructor, not the TA, may grant an extension. Everyone should try their best
to submit all assignments on their due dates. However, there are various
circumstances that may prevent a student from completing an assignment on
time. Therefore, late assignments will be penalized 10% per 24 hour period, or
fraction thereof. No special previsions will be made for weekends. Late
assignments will be acceptable up to one week late. After one week, late
assignments will no longer be accepted, and a score of zero will be assessed.
An assignment is considered turned in when it is physically in the hands of
the instructor or the TA or in the instructor's mailbox. When handing in a
late assignment, hand it into the mailbox of the instructor and write the day
and time of submission at the time you place it into the mailbox. This
date/time indication is considered part of the assignment and is subject to
the academic honesty expectations, as discussed below. This policy is
applicable to lab, homework, and programming assignments.

**Grading Errors -** Sometimes, mistakes do occur in the grading of
assignments. After a graded assignment has been returned, you have one week to
submit a request to have it regraded. This request must be in writing and
include the original assignment, as well as a brief description of your
dispute with the grade. Such a request should be submitted directly to the
instructor. After one week, no requests for assignment regrading will be
considered.

**Academic Honesty -** For many students, this is the first time you will be
programming a computer and the first time you will be debugging computer
programs. Hence, you need to learn what is allowed behavior and what is not.
When your program does not work, the first thing to do is use your book and
notes to try and figure out the problem yourself. The second and third things
to do are to try and figure out the problem yourself. At this point, you may
ask the assistance of the the course instructor, the TA, a classmate or friend
to help you identify and understand the specific problem. You may discuss, in
general terms, the general approach to solving a programming problem. Once the
discussion progresses to specific programming issues, such as the types of
variables to use, control structures, etc... you must end any collaboration.
This means that you may NOT: (1) compare answers to any assignment before it
is turned in, (2) supervise a classmate typing in a program or having a
classmate supervise you typing in a program, (3) copy, or allow another
student to copy, a file that contains another student's assignment, (4) work
together on an assignment, and (5) editing a script file and submitting it as
an original transcript of your computer session. Any evidence of performing
any form of academic misconduct will be appropriately handled as stated in the
Official Student Handbook of the University of Delaware. If you are in doubt
as to whether or not a behavior is permitted, please ask the instructor
beforehand!

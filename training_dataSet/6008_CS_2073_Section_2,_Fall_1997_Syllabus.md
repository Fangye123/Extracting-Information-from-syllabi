**Course Description:**

> **CS 2073 Computer Programming with Engineering Applications** (3-0) 3 hours
credit. Prerequisite: MAT 1214, and completion of or concurrent enrollment in
MAT 1223. Algorithmic approaches to problem solving and computer program
design for engineers. Engineering and mathematically oriented problem sets
will be emphasized, including non-numeric applications. Searching, sorting,
linked-lists, and data typing will be introduced. May not be applied toward a
major in Computer Science.

**Introduction to Engineering Programming**  
  
This course is the introductory programming course for an Engineering major at
UTSA. Some other majors, such as Math, may also take this course to fulfill
major requirements. Students majoring in other fields may wish to consult the
requirements for their major in the catalog for possible alternative courses:

  * CS 1073: Introductory Computer Programming for Scientific Applications 
  * CS 1713: Introduction to Computer Science 
  * CS 2083: Microcomputer Applications 

All students are welcomed to take CS 2073; however, this course is intensive
and designed specifically for the needs of engineering programmers, as opposed
to the general computing audience.

There are two main purposes of CS 2073. The first is to introduce the student
to elements of computer science in a problem solving context. The second is to
guide the student through learning a high-level programming language (C in our
case) while he or she writes programs of increasing complexity. **Note:** you
**must** have taken MAT 1214 before taking this class. Concepts introduced in
Calculus I are very important in computer programming. You must also take
concurrently (or have already taken) MAT 1223, Calculus II.

Students will learn about:

  * Basic concepts of computation. 
  * Basic use of the Unix operating system. 
  * The edit/compile/run cycle under Unix with ` cc`, `vi`, and `make`. 
  * Data types and precision. 
  * Arrays and matrices. 
  * Functions and subroutines. 
  * Records 
  * File handling. 
  * Sorting and searching. 
**Course Requirements:**

  * **Programming Assignments** (15% of grade):   
There will be approximately eight programming assignments to be done in C. The
programs will apply the problem solving concepts you learn in class. They will
be scored on a scale of 1-10 with the grades depending on:

    * Whether the program compiles without errors or warnings; 
    * The degree to which the program behaves correctly and instructions were followed; 
    * Adequacy of documentation; 
    * Style (discussed in class).  We will be using UTSA's ` runner` computer to do the assignments. If you have a computer at home, you may use it to develop your programs, but the project you turn in must work correctly on and be submitted from `runner.` You will normally turn the programs and output in by e-mail, with exact instructions given in the assignment. Although the programming assignments are 15% of the grade, they are the most important part of the learning process since doing them is how you learn to program. 
  * **Progress Reports** (10% of grade):   
Each time a program is due, each student will submit an article from his or
her ` runner` account to the UTSA newsgroup [ utsa.cs.2073.d
](news:utsa.cs.2073.d) giving an overview of the work he or she has done on
the current assignment ( **without giving any C code** ), his or her
impressions on what was discussed in class since the last report was
submitted, and at least one question about computer science or programming.
These articles must be in the students' own words and will be graded according
to content as well as grammar and spelling; part of being a computer scientist
is the ability to express yourself clearly. The articles are expected to be
thoughtful and not composed hurriedly at 11:55 the night they're due. Your
single-spaced article should normally fill two screenfuls on a VT320 terminal
(48 lines); more is fine. Note that the newsgroup is a public forum; anybody
at UTSA will be able to read the article (although only the individual
students will know the grade they made), so you are making an impression.

  * **Midterm Exam:** (15% of grade):   
There will one mid-term exam. This will be a closed book exam consisting of
true/false, short answer, and essay questions, and small programming problems.

  * **Second Exam:** (25% of grade): The second exam will be given toward the end of the semester. It will cover material up to that point, and be similar in format to the midterm. Note that it is worth more than the midterm. 
  * **Final Exam** (30% of grade):   
The final exam will be comprehensive. It will have much the same format as the
mid-term, but will be approximately twice as long.

  * **Class Participation** (5% of grade):   
During class, students are expected to ask questions and participate in class
discussions. This also includes discussions on the class newsgroup, [
utsa.cs.2073.d ](news:utsa.cs.2073.d). Students should read the newsgroup
frequently. Read your classmates posts and respond to their questions if you
know the answers. Also, important announcements (such as "the due date has
been changed") may be posted to the newsgroup; look for such messages. If you
have a question in class, ask it. Chances are that someone else has the same
question. If the instructor poses a question to the class, and you feel you
know the answer, answer it.  
  
**Note:** Late programs are not accepted. Late progress reports are not
accepted. You are given enough time to do the assignments if you start early.
Your lowest program and progress report grades will be dropped, so if you have
an emergency and can't complete an assignment, your grade will not be
affected. If you have two emergencies, bring the instructor documentation and
we'll talk. If you have to miss a test, you need to inform the instructor
**before** you miss the test through e-mail or calling the division office. In
this case, you will be allowed to substitute another grade or take a make-up
test at the instructor's discretion.

##  Academic Dishonesty

Unless a programming project is specifically assigned as a group project,
students are not allowed to work together on programs. You may discuss general
ideas related to the program, but you may not e.g. share program code or read
each others programs. Instances of such collaboration will be dealt with
harshly, but the real cost comes when a student doesn't know how to answer
questions on a test about issues involved in doing a project.

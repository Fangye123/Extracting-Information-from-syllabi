**INTRODUCTION**

Welcome to the Department of Foreign Languages! Undergraduate course work is
offered in foreign literatures and cultures, linguistics, Teaching English as
a Second Language, language teaching methods, and foreign languages, including
French, German, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Russian, and Spanish. The Department
also sponsors and administers the Intensive English Program in Eiesland Hall,
where international students may seek instruction in English as a Second
Language before matriculating into the university.

As a foreign language major or minor, you are greatly enhancing your ability
to function effectively in a complex world where a global economy and
international relations are playing an increasingly important role. This area
of study fits well with almost all types of career options: international
studies, political science, history, English, business, economics, journalism,
law, etc. In addition to job opportunities dealing with other countries, there
are also significant populations of non-English-speaking people in almost all
corners of the United States, allowing an individual knowledgeable in a second
or third language to have an edge in the job market in this country. Teaching
in the public schools, teaching English as a Second Language, government work,
social work, working for multi-national companies--all become viable options
for people with language skills. We strongly urge our students to combine a
degree in foreign languages with another major or minor. This can usually be
accomplished without having to go beyond the 128 credit hours needed for
graduation, if one plans early and carefully.

The Department of Foreign Languages encourages you to take advantage of all of
its resources. Advisors are available to help you prepare your plan of study
in order to make optimum use of your time and resources. Instructors and
coordinators are available to help you do your best in classes. Education
largely relies on communication -- two-way communication. You must become an
active participant in this education process by telling us as soon as you
perceive a need or a problem. Contact your advisor, your teacher, or the
language coordinator as soon as you begin to see a problem or have a question.
In this manner, you can be assured that all efforts will be taken to help you
succeed.

This booklet contains information that can help you navigate through your
years as a major or minor in the Department of Foreign Languages. The
information is accurate as of spring, 2001, but future curriculum revision or
resource allocation may necessitate changes at any time. Always check with the
departmental office, 205 Chitwood: phone: 304 293 5121 or e-mail:
mbendena@wvu.edu for updates. The departmental WEB site can also provide you
with important information:  http://www.as.wvu.edu/forlang.

*Course numbers given in this booklet include numbers used prior to fall, 2001 and their new counterparts (given in parentheses) used as of fall, 2001. Two sets of Departmental graduation requirements are also listed in this text: one set for students entering the University before fall, 2001, and another set for students entering the University as of fall, 2001.

**GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS**

  1. **DEPARTMENTAL REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MAJOR IN FOREIGN LANGUAGES  
(For students entering the University BEFORE FALL, 2001) **

The Bachelor of Arts degree in foreign languages offers six areas of emphasis:
French, German, Russian, Spanish, Linguistics/TESL, and Foreign Literature in
Translation. Depending upon the area of emphasis selected, majors are expected
to develop the ability to communicate through reading, writing, speaking, and
listening in one or more foreign languages. They should also have knowledge of
the culture and literatures related to those languages and have a general
understanding of how human languages operate.

To be admitted to the major in foreign languages, students must have completed
the equivalent of four semesters of elementary and intermediate courses in one
language. They also must have completed 58 credit hours with an overall 2.0
grade point average. They must continue to maintain an overall 2.0 grade point
average for graduation.

Foreign language majors must complete a minimum of 27 credit hours of upper-
division work offered in the Department of Foreign Languages. (Upper-division
is defined as courses numbered 100 (300) or above.) All majors must take
Linguistics 111(311). Only Linguistics/TESL majors may count Language 221(421)
as part of their major. Students electing French, German, Linguistics/TESOL,
Russian, or Spanish options may NOT use FLIT courses to fulfill the major
requirements but may use them for the secondary area of concentration. No
undergraduate ESL course may count in the major.

Students obtaining a major in Foreign Languages at WVU must complete a minimum
residency requirement of 12 upper-division hours on campus in their major
language of study, excluding courses numbered 191(493) and courses obtained
through credit by exam.

The foreign language major must select one of the following major areas of
emphasis and complete the courses listed:

FRENCH:

  |

  
Linguistics 111(311)  
French l03(301), l04(302), l09(303), and l10(304)

---|---  
  
All students majoring in foreign languages must complete either a minor or an
approved concentration of course work that complements their major. The
requirement for this "secondary concentration" may be met in one of four ways:

  1. Completion of twelve hours of upper-division credit, from within or outside the Department of Foreign Languages, with the same division prefix. (e.g. GER, HIST, BUS, PSYCH, FLIT). The courses that constitute the 12-hour secondary concentration are subject to the availability of courses, must be approved by the student's advisor, and may not include courses required for the student's major.  

  2. Completion of twelve hours of upper-division credit in the major area or from a combination of division prefixes that together focus on a common topic or subject area that complements the major area of study (e.g., French history, French art, French music). The courses that constitute the 12 hours in this option are subject to availability, must be approved by the student's advisor, and may not include courses required for the student's major.  

  3. Completion of an approved minor. Requirements for minors are set by the academic unit offering them and include a minimum of 15 hours of course work, with a minimum of 9 hours at the upper-division level.  

  4. Completion of a second major.

In order to provide students with a balanced liberal arts education, the
Eberly College of Arts and Sciences does not permit students to take more than
60 hours of the 128 hours needed for graduation in their major department.
Foreign language majors may exclude from the 60-hour limit Linguistics
111(311), Language 221(421), and language 1-4(101, 102, 203, 204) taken to
fulfill the Eberly College of Arts and Sciences language requirement

**STUDY ABROAD**

Foreign Study is recognized by the Department of Foreign Languages as an
important component of the cultural and linguistic preparation of its
students. We encourage students to consider both international programs on
campus and study abroad. At present, the Department offers summer programs in
France, Germany, Mexico, and Spain.

The Department receives many advertisements throughout the year, describing
various study-abroad opportunities. It posts these on bulletin boards in
Chitwood and Eiesland Halls, but does not endorse any programs outside of West
Virginia University. Students planning to do study abroad should work closely
with Dr. Frank W. Medley, Jr., Chair of the Department (205 Chitwood Hall)
before they leave in order to fill out the Transient Student Form and receive
credit for the work they do abroad.

The University prohibits students from receiving credit twice for the same
work. If students assume they will be placed at a certain level in a study-
abroad program and then find that they are placed at a level which they have
already passed, they may not receive credit.

**ADVISING**

When students enter the university as freshmen, they are designated as _pre-
majors_ and are advised in the  Advising Center. If pre-majors prefer to be
advised in the Department, they may request that their files be sent to the
Department of Foreign Languages by contacting  Marilyn Bendena in 205
Chitwood. When students earn 58 credit hours, they officially may declare
their major. Their files are sent to their major department, where they will
be advised. In order to declare a major, students should see Rose Eavenson in
202  Student Services Center (phone 293 7476).

Michael Lastinger (220 Chitwood) advises all French majors.  Marilyn Bendena
advises all other majors and minors in the Department. It is important to keep
in touch with your advisor. Give updates of your address and phone number so
that important information can be sent to you.

Pre-registration usually begins right after mid-terms. In order to get the
classes you need, register as early as possible. Also, if you are having
academic problems, talk with your advisor: help may be available early so that
you won't have to drop a course or receive a poor grade. Remember, two-way
communication can often prevent many problems from becoming disasters!

At least one semester before graduation all majors should visit Rose Eavenson
in order to do a _Graduation Check_. If there are still requirements
outstanding, there will be time to register for them, and graduation will not
have to be delayed. **All graduating seniors in _all_ foreign language areas
of emphasis should also see Marilyn Bendena to have their final _Graduation
Check_ ** for departmental requirements. Students may have their _**Exit
Interviews**_ done at the same time. This interview allows students to let us
know how they feel about their experiences in the Department.

**PLACEMENT TEST**

As of August, l995, all students who have studied French, German, or Spanish
within five years before entry into West Virginia University must take a
computerized placement test before registering for a course in one of these
languages. The exams are free and are given during freshman orientation, at
the beginning of each semester, and during pre-registration.

If you successfully pass the course in which you place with a B or better, you
will automatically receive credit for all the courses you placed out of
without additional charge for tuition on those courses. You may take the exam
only once for each language you have studied. The back credit applies only to
courses l-4(101, 102, 203, 204). For further information, please contact the
Chair's Office.

Back to top of page



**CREDIT BY EXAM**

Students may take credit by exam for language courses 1-4(101, 102, 203, 204)
and 103(301), 104(302), 109(303), and 110(304). If you wish to challenge a
course, you may pay $50 and take a credit by exam. If you score at least 70%,
you will receive credit for the course. If you score 80% or better, you need
only pay the additional $50 for each course below the one which you passed in
order to receive the credit. This last option applies only to language
l-4(101, 102, 203, 204) courses. Courses beyond 110(304) may not be challenged
by exam. With the permission of the chair, individuals pursuing certification
may challenge courses required for certification.

**DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES**

**Tutoring**

The Department of Foreign Languages recognizes that tutoring can be very
beneficial when used responsibly. Tutors can help students identify
difficulties, errors, problems, etc. and can provide valuable direction in
correcting the above.

The purpose of written and oral assignments in any foreign language is
essentially two-fold. Such assignments provide students with the opportunity
to utilize and practice, with the goal of improving, the language of study. At
the same time, these assignments provide the instructor the opportunity to
evaluate the students' abilities and progress in the language.

For this reason, tutors (whether university-affiliated or private individuals)
are prohibited from completing, correcting, or providing any answers on any
work for which students will receive a grade. This practice not only hinders
the learning process, it is a major breach of academic integrity and honesty
(see _The Mountie_ , section 3.1.1.3.2), both on the part of the tutors and
the students, and will be prosecuted accordingly.

**Academic Honesty and Integrity**

The Department of Foreign Languages expects all students to perform with
honesty and integrity in all areas of their academic development. Violations
such as, but not limited to, those described below will not be tolerated.

  1. Plagiarism (see _The Mountie_ , section 3.1.1.3.1) 
  2. Cheating and dishonest practices in connection with examinations, papers, and projects (see _The Mountie_ , section 31.1.3.2).  
NOTE: This includes, but is not limited to, all written and oral assignments.
Unless otherwise indicated by the instructor, all such work must be prepared
by each student independently; for example, students may not copy one
another's homework, and students with tutors (whether university-affiliated or
private individuals) may not receive assistance on any work that is to be
graded. In short, any work done in collaboration--unless expressly permitted
by the instructor--constitutes academic dishonesty.

  3. Forgery, misrepresentation, or fraud (see _The Mountie_ , section 3.1.1.3.3). 

All known incidences of academic dishonesty will be prosecuted to the fullest
extent allowable.

** STUDY TIPS**

To successfully master a foreign language, one needs to practice, just as one
must routinely practice any skill, be it playing the piano or hitting a tennis
ball. This means that language study should not occur in a last-minute cram
session the night before an exam. Rather, one should work at it each day. As
you walk home from class, wash the dishes, or take a shower, **talk out loud**
in the target language. Find friends or create study groups to help you
converse. Keep a journal in the target language. Get tapes or listen to songs
in the language. The more active exposure you have to the use of the language,
the quicker you will improve your skills.

One of the worst enemies of language learning is one's own timidity and fear
of making a mistake in front of others. Only by **actively** trying to speak
and write, however, will you conquer this obstacle. You are, after all,
putting considerable time and resources into this task--why not take full
advantage and learn in the optimum manner?

Here are some other useful tips that do work:

  1. Attend class regularly and do your homework. All instructors in the Department of Foreign Languages have an attendance policy stated in the Syllabus. It is there, not to plague students, but to accent the importance of daily language practice. The Department backs all required attendance policies and _underscores that final grades will be lowered for unexcused absences as stated in the departmental syllabuses.  
_

  2. Make every effort to actively participate in class discussions. Create study groups with classmates in order to practice outside of class.  

  3. Make use of the tapes and computer programs offered in the Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) Laboratory, located in Eiesland Hall.  

  4. The Department does not offer official tutoring services, nor does it set fees. However, instructors and coordinators often have names of majors and graduate students or native speakers who are willing to tutor, either for free or for a fee. A tutor is an excellent tool for reviewing difficult grammar points or for practicing the language. Caution must be taken, however, so that the tutor does not wind up correcting assignments or compositions to the point that cheating becomes an issue. Remember, compositions in a foreign language infer the creation of language as well as the creation of a logical thesis. It is unwise to allow a tutor to "work on" or "perfect" a composition: the composition is no longer _your_ work, and you can be accused of cheating.  

  5. Do not wait if you think you don't understand something or have a problem. Inform the instructor, the coordinator, or your advisor. We are eager to do all we can to help you succeed. All of us have flexible office hours for precisely such situations.

In conclusion, we welcome you to the Department of Foreign Languages, where,
through your academic and social pursuits, you will come to know other
exciting worlds and cultures.

**Academic Honesty:**

Embry-Riddle policies are in effect. Academic honesty is required of all

cheating or plagiarism on tests, examinations, papers, or other course
assignments. Students who engage in such dishonesty may be given failing
grades or expelled from the University.  
  
Plagiarism -- the appropriation of imitation of the language or ideas of
another person and presenting them as one's original work -- sometimes occurs
through carelessness or ignorance. If you are uncertain about proper
documentation of sources, please e-mail me. If you quote or paraphrase someone
else's work you must give the source credit through a footnote. Ignorance is
no excuse.

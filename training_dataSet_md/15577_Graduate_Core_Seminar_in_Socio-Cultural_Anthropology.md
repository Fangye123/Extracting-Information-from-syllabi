**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  
    The aim of this course is to give a broad overview of the historical trajectories of the discipline, as well as to provide close readings of key texts in contemporary theory.  Emphasis will be placed on techniques of critical thought, such as how to 'read against the grain', and how to uncover underlying assumptions and paradigmatic statements.

**CLASS REQUIREMENTS:**

**Policy on grades, illness, emergencies, and extensions:**  
    Completion of the term paper (40%), weekly essays (50%), class participation (5%), and leading discussions (5%) will form the basis for evaluating performance.  Please retain for your own records a copy of all the work you submit.  All written work must be completed to receive a passing grade in this class.   
    Late papers and exams will lose one letter grade for each day past due except in the event of severe illness or emergency.  Requests for extensions on deadlines should be made in writing ahead of the due date.

**Term paper and Presentation OR Final Exam (40%)**  
    Students choosing the research paper option will write a 15-20 page paper on a topic of their choice, and present the results during one class period. The recommended readings on any week of the syllabus would make a good place to start reading. Students wishing to use this writing opportunity to work on a 'theory chapter' for their theses should meet with the instructor to discuss options. Presentations will be made during the last week of class. See the last page of this syllabus for more information.   
    Students choosing the final exam option will write a 15-20 page take-home final exam answering two comprehensive essays taken from a review sheet handed out in advance. The final will cover all the materials presented in class.  Essays should be well-written, double spaced, typed, and turned in to Connie in the Anthropology Department.

**Weekly Short Essays (50%)**  
    In order to help you grow familiar with the readings, to facilitate discussion, and to ensure student involvement, each student is asked to write an essay each week for weeks 2 through 9 (8 weeks and 8 essays in total).  Each essay should address some or all of the week's reading.  These brief (3 page) papers are intended to catalyze thought, crystalize opinions, and provoke classroom debate.  In an essay you can briefly outline what you feel to be the main points and arguments of the readings for the week and relate them to other readings and discussions in the class to date. You might choose a quote that intrigues you and discuss it. Do the authors support or contradict each other?  Do you agree with the various authors?  Why or why not? The focus should be on your own synthesis and ideas, but the paper should remain closely tied to the assigned texts. Most importantly, you should explore ideas, inspirations, criticisms and questions that arise from your interactions with the texts.  These should be forward-looking, original-thinking essays that situate your own thoughts, points of view or research in the writings for the week.  Essays should have a direction, a theme, or a purpose, instead of being mere summaries of the readings.  Demonstrate your mastery of the week's subjects by using ideas in the readings creatively.   
    Grades will be assigned on both form and content; good writing counts, here and everywhere.  'Form' refers to organization, argument structure, paragraph structure and flow, grammar, correct citations, etc.  'Content' will be judged on the basis of your interactions with the texts -- your understanding of the readings, your ability to relate materials in this week to materials in other weeks of the course, your insightful questions, and the scope of the material you cover (eg., one article will be weighed less than 3 books....)  Essays will also be read by the week's discussion leader, so please turn in TWO COPIES of your commentary on Monday in class for use in Wednesday discussions. Your pieces must be on time to be effective.  Late work will be penalized.

**Facilitating Discussion (5%)**  
    Students will lead discussions either individually or in teams on one or two subsections of the course.  You are encouraged to meet with the instructor before the class you facilitate.  You might consider reading one or several of the recommended readings, if time permits.  Feel free to use audio-visual aids, handouts, or other creative learning techniques as you see fit.

**Participation and Attendance (5%)**  
    Regular attendance and active participation in class is expected and required.

**Guidelines and Requirements for Graduate Term Papers**  
    Graduate students in this course are required to write a 15-20 page research paper that will count for 40% of the final grade.  To avoid a rush at the end of the term, and to allow me to give you feedback on your work before assigning a final grade, you are asked to prepare this paper in stages.  The assignments below, which build toward a polished essay, will be commented on but not graded.  Please hand them in on time. 

  * Weeks 1 & 2:  Brain-storm in class, with friends, and with the instructor about possible paper topics.  Look through the syllabus for issues of interest arising later in the term for possible inspiration.  Go to the library and see what literature is available on the topic of your choice. 
  * Week 3:  Submit a written statement of the general topic that your research paper will address.  Also submit an annotated bibliography of five items pertinent to your proposed research. 
  * Week 5:  Submit five specific questions that your research will address.  Also submit an annotated working bibliography of at least fifteen items (including the five submitted previously). These may include sources that you have reviewed and decided not to include in your final paper. 
  * Week 7:  Submit a preliminary outline of your paper, with as much detail as possible (at least one page in length). 
  * Week 9:  Submit the first draft of your paper.  This will be returned to you with extensive comments on content, structure, logic, evidence, writing style, etc. 
  * Week 10:  Submit the final draft of your research paper, with the edited first draft attached.  This draft will be graded but not commented on. 

Note: My expectations for graduate level research papers include the
following:

  * I expect well-written final papers.  If I have made comments that you do not understand about organizational structure, argument style, paragraphing, sentence structure, grammar, spelling, etc., on your first draft, I suggest that you take your paper to a friend or to the Writing Center (188F Cramer Hall, 725-3570) for help.  Style will be taken into account in your grade. 
  * In writing about your chosen topic, you should not only review and assess the previous research of other scholars, but should also raise new questions and suggest the types of research that could be done in pursuing further understanding of the issues raised.  Merely recounting the theories of others will not suffice; say something original.

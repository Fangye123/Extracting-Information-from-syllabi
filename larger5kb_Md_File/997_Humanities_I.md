#### **_Course Description:_**

         In the original sense of the word, the humanities are the educational disciplines that foster `humanitas', i.e. activate all of the faculties of an individual - emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual - and make the individual into a fully-functioning person. More concretely, the humanities are those non-scientific, non-vocational subjects that lie at the heart of our Western cultural legacy: literature, history, philosophy, religion, and the arts. 

The General Education sequence Humanities I-II (with dividing line between the
two segments at about 1600) constitutes an introduction to the Western
heritage, i.e. the history of European civilization and its greatest cultural
achievements. Specifically, its goals are to provide students with an
understanding of the development of Western history from its beginning to the
present, an acquaintance with some of the finest examples of the West's
creative works, and an initiation into the West's tradition of both personal
and collective self-examination.

The instructor hopes to help students appreciate some of the great works of
literature, philosophy, and political theory written during this period, and
to show students the perennial significance of the questions these works
address.

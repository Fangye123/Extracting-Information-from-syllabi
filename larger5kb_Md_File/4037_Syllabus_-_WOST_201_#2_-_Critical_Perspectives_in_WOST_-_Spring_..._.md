Who are the "women" of Women's Studies? What characteristics of women are and
should be examined in Women's Studies and feminist thought? Can "women" be
studied as a category or group? If so, how can we conceptualize this category
so that it is reflective of all the similarities among us as well as our
differences between us? If not, is the study of women justifiable or
necessary? The ultimate question then becomes what is Women's Studies? Is
there a prevailing type of feminist thought or Women's Studies? Who has a
powerful voice, who is ignored and for what reasons?

Some of the issues to be examined in this course are concepts of gender, race,
class and sexual orientation. More specifically we will try to answer the
following questions: Can we say that all women are oppressed, when some of us
benefit from combinations of white privilege, class privilege, heterosexual
privilege and even language privilege? What effect do our identities and
conversely peoples perceptions/prejudices have on feminist politics? What is
the importance of claiming a multiplicative identity? What is the effect of
claiming identities such as Woman, African-American, Latina, Native American,
Arab-American, Asian American, Gay, Bisexual, Heterosexual, and Working class?

Social identity and position strongly influence our perspective of women and
consequently our political action regarding women. Every one of us is part of
the systems of power and hierarchy that we are going to be studying. Let us
not forget that. Incorporating this reality into our examination of women will
deeply affect our personal assumptions and wider political realities. We are
each tied to the larger picture. For example, our discussion of race will not,
and cannot be limited to women of color. Race, more specifically white
supremacy (in its various forms), has informed American culture and politics
since the inception of the United States. Part of our effort is to realize our
difficulties in seeing a reality we have been trained our entire lives not to
see. Part of your education in this class will entail personal examination so
that we can discover what blocks our ability to hear/learn new information,
our ability to realize, accept, and integrate difference.

_**REQUIRED BOOKS_** (books are available at Food For Thought in downtown

**Feminism is for Everybody: Passionate Politics** (bell hooks)  
**Course Reader** (available in WOST office: 208 Bartlett)

_**OPTIONAL BOOK_

_**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**_

  1. **Social Positionality paper** : This is a **3 page minimum** paper. This assignment is vitally important and deserves your intense consideration and effort. You will be sharing this paper with members of your research group as part of your final project. This paper will effect your outlook and ability to learn throughout the course. **10% of grade. Due 3/5**

  2. **Descriptive Paper:** One paper (3-page minimum) summarizing your understanding of one of the theoretical articles we will read. **15% of grade. Due 2/14.**

  3. Analytic paper:** One paper of 5 pages will be required during the semester on a topic to be announced. This paper will require you to do an analysis of a topic found in the material for this course, rather than doing library research on topics not addressed in class. **15% of your grade. Due 4/4**

  4. **Class participation:** The issues discussed this semester will have both academic and personal implications. In order to grapple with this material, it is vital to read the assignments carefully and on time, come to class with questions, opinions, and analyses (agreements and disagreements). Otherwise said, be prepared to participate in debate. Class participation is quality not quantity. Your presence does not qualify as participation. **10% of grade.**

  5. **Reading Analysis:** Four **(4)** short papers assigned with the intent of helping you to sharpen your skills of analysis. For five course readings throughout the semester, you are required to write a (1-2)-page paper examining an aspect of the article/chapter. **Do not repeat** the information of the article, but examine a point, its meaning, relevance and whether you agree or disagree, stating why. Personal connections are welcome, but should be used as support, not as subject. **Each paper is worth 5% of your grade/20% total.**

  6. **Group Project:** Students will work in groups doing a final research project. Topics will be discussed in class and must be course material related. Your group will chose together which topic to examine and how you will tackle this. Your social positionality papers will be part of this decision and research process. Part of the purpose of this project is to examine how 1) women work together accounting for their differences and 2) how despite or because of differences women still have common goals to achieve. An oral presentation on the project will count for **15% of your grade** and the final written (10 pages minimum) report for **15% of your grade (due 5/15).** 

**NOTE:** Some of the reading may be difficult for students who have not
experienced theoretical material. You are strongly encouraged to keep a list
of words you do not understand and look them up. You are likely to encounter
these words in the future. Write down any questions you may have and bring
them to class. Someone else is likely to have the same question. This class is
about your **LEARNING** experience, not about hiding what you do not know!!!!!

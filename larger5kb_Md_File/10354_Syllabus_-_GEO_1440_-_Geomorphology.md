###  Course Description

In June of 2001, students and faculty of the NU Geology Department will travel
to Newfoundland & Labrador, Canada for a 17-day trip to learn about
sedimentation, tectonics, glaciation, and climate history. The first part of
the class is taught by Professor Bailey. He will focus on the on late
Precambrian and early Paleozoic sedimentation, as well as the tectonic history
of Newfoundland. Professor Naylor will talk about the unique exposures of
ophiolites in Newfoundland and their plate tectonic significance. Professor
Colgan will focus on the glacialgeomorphology, and climate history of
Newfoundland.

###  Course Goals

The major goal of the trip is to learn how to observe and describe rocks,
sediments, and landforms in the field. 1). You will learn how to describe and
take notes about rocks and sediments in the field. 2). You will learn how
geologists study landforms in the field. 3). You will learn about the regional
geologic history of eastern North America. 4). Of course you will have a great
time doing this.

###  Required Texts

Colman-Sadd, S., and Scott, S.A., 1994, Newfoundland and Labrador Travellers
Guide to the Geology: Geological Association of Canada, Newfoundland Section.
Cost $18.20 (you can buy from Colgan on first day of class).

All-Weather Geological Field Book $13.50 (you can buy from Colgan on first day
of class).

###  Grading

Your grade will be calculated based on how you do on the following parts of
the class. The field notebook will be kept during the trip and adjustments
will be made to you final grade based on the quality and detail of your field
notes.

  * First Exam 25% - this will cover the material presented by Bailey and Naylor
  * Second Exam 25% - this will cover the material presented by Colgan
  * Term paper - 20% - will cover a topic related to one of our stops during the trip
  * Homework Exercises - 20% - four short homework assignments
  * Field notes  \- 10% - these will be taken during the trip

###  Class Attendance

Attendance of class is mandatory.

###  Late Homework Policy

Your homework should be turned in on time. Homework turned in late will be
penalized one point (on a ten point scale) per day it is late. Late homeowrk
will not be accepted after they have been returned to class. It normally takes
about 7-10 days to grade and return your homework.

###  Trip Expenses

The trip should cost less than $400 each person. Since we haven't run this
trip before we are not certain as to what the final cost will be. Your cost
will be $400 or less no matter what the cost. We will need you to give
professor Bailey $200 in the next two weeks. By June 1, 2001 we will need the
next $200. After the trip we will determine if and how much of a refund you
will receive based on what we actually spent.

** **References**  

**Course Description and Course Goals**  
This course is designed to introduce students to the major features of
research proposals and the basic principles of rhetorical theory relating to
persuasive discourse in proposal writing. The purpose of this course is to
help students  
(i) gain an understanding of a systematic method for researching funding
sources, designing, writing and submitting proposals.  
(ii) acquire skills in use of computing technology and presentation of their
work.  
  
**Course Objectives**  
By the end of the course students should be able to:  
(a)interpret a Request for Proposals (RFP) or Request for Applications (RA).  
(b) write a research proposal and compile a complete proposal packet for a
specific funding organization.  
(c ) analyze and evaluate proposals.  
(d) demonstrate a variety of computing technology skills cultivated in the
course, as well as define the applicability of the Internet and presentation
software to the process of researching, writing, reviewing, evaluation and
presentation of research proposals.  
  
**Required Texts and Materials**  
The following texts are available at H. D. Smith Bookstore.  
Berhling, J. H. 1984, _Guideline for Preparing the Research Proposal,_ Revised
Edition, Lanham MD, University Press of America.  
Locke, L. F. , W. W. Spirduso and S. J. Silverman, 2000. _Proposals That Work:
A Guide for Planning Dissertations and Grant Proposals,_ Fourth Edition,
Thousand Oaks, London, New Delhi, Sage Publications, Inc.  
Krawthowl, D. R. 1988. _How to Prepare a Research Proposal: Guidelines for
Funding Dissertations in the Social and Behavioral Sciences,_ Third Edition,
New York, Syracuse University.  
CD- ROMs, Video Tape Recorders, Overhead Projectors, LCD Projector and disks.  
Additional readings and media assigned in the syllabus have been placed on
reserve. You must request these readings individually. Media used in this
course will be on reserve in the media center.

**Teaching Philosophy**  
My teaching philosophy is that the chief agent in the learning process is the
learner and all activities are learner centered. Through the use of Internet,
Web and CD-ROMs, this course will create environments and experiences that
bring students to discover and construct knowledge on research proposals for
themselves. Cooperative learning will be the basis of the learning process
because it promotes active learning among students of diversified social and
intellectual backgrounds. I will use small group discussions and peer review
on Internet to promote interaction between students. Permanent formal
cooperative groups will be used for long- term projects to promote a sense of
responsibility and to instill the value of team work.  

**Course Requirements**  
Students must come to class regularly. No student will pass the course if s/he
inexcusably misses class more than three times. An excused absence is allowed
if the student informs me before class. Students are expected to complete all
written and computer assignments. This is a participation- intensive seminar,
10% lecture and 90% class discussion. The format requires that students come
to class prepared to discuss. Sessions are devoted to critical discussions of
work assigned in the syllabus. There are no final exams.  

**Policy on Folders and Late Papers**  
Students will put all corrected assignments and peer reviews (including
printed computer assignments) in a folder that will be handed in on May 12. A
student must inform me in advance if, for some reason, s/he cannot hand in an
assignment on time. Late assignments will be dropped 25 percent of a grade
each day an assignment is late. If a student wants to make up for a computer
class, all media will be on reserve in the media center.  

**Policy Regarding Rewrites and Incompletes**  
If a student receives a grade of C+ or below s/he has one week to rewrite the
paper. A student must see me first, and go over the problem in the paper. The
highest grade for a rewritten paper is B+. To request a grade of incomplete a
student must submit to me in writing, not later than May 02, a list of all
assignments that s/he has completed. A student must have completed at least
half of all the assignments. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, a
student will not get an incomplete if s/he has more than three absences. I
will deny an Incomplete if any of the above information is missing.  

**Computer Lab**  
Our class will do assignments and research work on the computers during part
of the class time. This way students will get hands- on instruction about the
Internet, the Web and the CD- ROMs. Rules regarding the computer class- room
are as follows: 1) No food or drink allowed. Students who violate this
regulation will be asked to leave the class and will be awarded an absence (A)
for that class period. 2) Follow instructions by the instructor and technical
staff. 3) Students must check their disks for viruses before the beginning of
the class. If a student uses a virus infected disk s/he will get an F for the
course. The computer lab, Anderson 130, will be free the following days and
hours:  
Mondays: 3:00- 6:00 p.m.; Tuesdays: 3:00- 6:00 p.m.; Fridays: 12:00- 6:00 p.m.

**Special Needs**  
Students with disabilities that affect their learning abilities should bring
this to the attention of the instructor so that appropriate accommodation can
be arranged. Further information is available from the Disabilities Services,
16 Johnston Hall.  

**Classroom Environment**  
University policy prohibiment are available at 419 Morril Hall. Complaints
about harassment should be reported to the University Office of Equal
Opportunity at 419 Morril Hall.  
  
**Scholastic Dishonesty**  
The College of Liberal Arts defines academic dishonesty as  "any act that
violates the rights of another student or that involves misrepresentation of a
student's own work. Scholastic dishonesty includes (but is not limited to)
cheating on assignments or examinations, plagiarizing (misrepresenting as
one's own anything done by another), submitting the same or substantially
similar papers for more than one course without the consent of all instructors
concerned, depriving another of necessary course materials, and sabotaging
another's work." All acts of misconduct in this course will be reported to the
College's Student Scholastic Conduct Committee. I will assign an 'F' for the
course to students found guilty of academic dishonesty.

_Course Objectives_ :  
Our goals this term cluster around understanding the generative role of
nineteenth-century history for our contemporary social, political and cultural
world. Globalization and Human Rights will constitute our foundational
concepts during this term. Our goal is to understand the Nineteenth Century
contributions to the status of globalization and human rights in the early
21st Century.  
"Revolutionary Europe" refers in the most simple interpretation to the French
Revolution of 1789 and its long-term aftermath (revolutions in different
European states in 1830, 1848, 1871 and 1917), and to the Industrial
Revolution, which thrust the world from a predominantly agrarian economy into
a machine-based and urban economy. Another phrase for the complicated
developments stemming from the French Revolution and the Industrial Revolution
is "modernization." However, modernization is a word that is often either
misused or exploited for nefarious political gain, and for those reasons I
will do my best to avoid using it. (Philip Curtin, in the preface to The World
and the West, explains in greater depth the meanings and misuses of
"modernization.")

**Internet-based Course Delivery**

CS 656 Section 03 will make use of an internet-based course delivery system.
Classes will be available on computer desktops at home or office by using
dial-up through GMU Internet facilities. System requirements are a multimedia
Pentium computer with Microsoft Windows 95 or later and Microsoft Internet
Explorer 4 or later, and a 28.8kbps or better modem. Instructor's voice,
slides, and slide annotations are delivered to the student's desktop; students  
can ask questions via text input. Classes are recorded as delivered and can be
played back through the same  
setup. A password is required to access online delivery and playback of
classes. To request a password, send to  
help@netlab.gmu.edu an email that states you are in Dr.Simon's CS656 and gives
your GMU account ID. (To test Internet class reception, try
<http://netlab.gmu.edu/cwtest> using Internet Explorer 4 or later.   _All
exams will still need to_  
_be taken in class at the appropriate times!_

##  Course Description:

Techniques and systems for communication of data between computational devices
and protocols of the seven-layer ISO reference model. Topics include the role
of various media and software components, local and wide area network
protocols, network design, performance and cost considerations, and emerging
advanced commercial technologies. Emphasis is on the TCP/IP family of
protocols.  
**Prerequisites** :

  * CS 571 and STAT 344.

##  Grading Policy:

  * Midterm Exam 30%
  * Final Exam  30%
  * Network Bench project 30%
  * Class participation and occasional homework 10%
  * Late assignments and projects automatically lose 10% per day without exceptions

##  Project

We will use the Network Workbench, a collection of modules developed at GMU
that simulate a protocol stack and display the results, using a text or
graphic interface. Students will create modules for Data Link Control, Network
and Transport layers and run them in the Workbench environment. The Workbench
will be available via SITE computing labs in ST2-18, 133, and 137 and by dial-
in. Well documented code must be submitted by email for grading. Projects and
programming assignments are individual efforts.

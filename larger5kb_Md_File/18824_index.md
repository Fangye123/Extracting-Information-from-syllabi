**Course Description**

An exploration of contemporary policy, strategy, and management issues in
manufacturing and service organizations.  The course will focus on an
integrated "product delivery" system in the marketplace: how to formulate
policy and develop strategy for it and how to design it.  The course includes
studies of different topologies for delivery of produces and services, and of
their underlying infrastructure.

This course strives to provide practical insights, and develop tools and
concepts, which can be applied to support the development of sustained
competitive advantage and the sustainability of manufacturing and service
enterprises.  The course places an emphasis on entrepreneurial approaches to
innovation in small, medium and large enterprises in a global marketplace.  
  
**Course Objective s**

In this course, objectives include the following:

1)      To develop an awareness of the range, scope and complexity of the
phenomena, issues, and problems related to the management of manufacturing and
service enterprises.

2)      To develop a framework for designing and assessing management, policy
and strategy issues in manufacturing and service enterprises.

3)      To develop an understanding of the role of entrepreneurship and
innovation in the strategic development of small, medium and large
manufacturing and service enterprises.

4)      To develop decision making and communication skills with particular
emphasis on core competencies needed to compete in a rapidly changing, dynamic
business environment.

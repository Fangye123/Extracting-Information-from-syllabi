###  COURSE REQUIREMENTS

**A.** Visit two media service units in libraries of your choice and produce
(photographic prints) a visualized **critique** (descriptive essays are not
requested).   Your **critique** should be a critical review or commentary with
appropiate visuals illustrating your main ten recommendations.    Present your
ten redommendations on the course WBB. Refer to the scanning and WBB posting
guidelines at
[http://www.sis.buffalo.edu/faculty/ellison/scanning.html](../../resources/scanning.html).
However, if you do not have or are near a place with scanning equipment, you
may mail me this assignment using photographs.  If possible, work in groups of
five or so on this project. You must request and receive the approval from the
library prior to starting this project. Use the [Media Library Visitation
Checklist](519mediaevaluation.html) to help identify areas/topics to be
**critiqued**.   Please look up the word " **critique** " to make sure you
know what is expected.

**B.** Prepare four non-book (one paragraph each) format reviews.  Select a
different non-book CD, video, original art, film, model, toy for each review.
**_Follow the review criteria presented in class._** Email me a copy of your
reviews for marking.  

**C.** Each person will identify **Internet WebPages** (sources) related to
one non-book format (see **Software Formats to be Covered in this Course**
above).   You will post links to the WebPages you have identified when that
format is discussed in class.  Submit a list of three non-book
formats/software to me the first week.  I will try and assign you one of those
formats for your WebPages search. Also, submit this assignment to me via email
for marking.

**D.** Participate on Class [WebBulletinBoard
(WBB)](http://www.sis.buffalo.edu/scripts/sis/ellison/control/enter.htm)

additional information, citations, facts, research, along with your critical
insight to the WBB.   Opinions, feelings, and beliefs alone are fine to have,
but they will **_not_** be considered for credit.   It is strongly suggested
that you go to a library and checkout several dozen books and journals on non-
book formats, media management, media selection, etc. and keep them near your
computer during times you are working on the WBB.  Journals and Internet
sources can also be used and cited.  As you post your Participation
contributions on the WBB, indicate the number of each contribution on the
subject line, i.e. #1, #2, #3, and so on.

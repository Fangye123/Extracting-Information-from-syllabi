169\. Social Inequality

Instructor: Dana Takagi

In this class we will study inequality and stratifcation in post-WWI America.
The focus will be on cultural representations of inequality and social
stratification, through, primarily, film and video. Our main objective this
quarter is threefold: a) to understand the broad contours of inequality and
social stratification research in sociology, b) to locate the contour
sociological research about stratification to different historical periods in
the post-war era, and c) to analyze the realm of "popular" culture in relation
to sociological research.

Famine, mass death from starvation, has been recorded throughout human
history. In the twentieth century, this most terrible form of hunger became
uncommon in the industrialized world, but famines still occurred in Asia and
Africa. Even in parts of the industrialized world, at the beginning of the
twenty-first century, persistent hunger and poverty continue to be widespread.
Recent findings suggest that famine can be prevented; and in some parts of the
world, there has been marked progress in the reduction of poverty.
Nevertheless, hunger and poverty remain widespread in Africa, Asia, and the
USA.

### Course Description

In this course we will examine key writings on hunger and famine and use them
to explore film and newspaper representations of these issues. We will debate
some questions, including "democracy can prevent famine," and "global
institutions should prevent famine and hunger."

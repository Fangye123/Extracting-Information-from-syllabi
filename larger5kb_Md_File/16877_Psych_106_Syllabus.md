Introduction to Psychology:  
The Emotional Brain  
Psychology 106 R. Cornelius  
Fall 1999 Blodgett 119

    
    
    The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the science ofpsychology.  The course does this by exploring contemporary research onemotion with an emphasis on the physiological mechanisms underlyingemotional phenomena.  Special emphasis is given to scientific methodologyin the study of emotion in order to give you a solid background in howpsychologists and other scientists carry out their research.  You willleave the course not only with an understanding of the anatomy andphysiology of the central and peripheral nervous system mechanismsunderlying emotion and emotional expression, the physiology of psychoactivechemicals, and the nature and treatment of emotional disorders, but alsowith the necessary knowledge and conceptual tools to continue your ownexplorations in psychology and other experimental sciences.   
       
    Requirements
    
    Evaluation for the course is based on three (3) exams, two (2) laboratoryprojects, five (5) brief exercises, and class participation.  Your finalgrade is determined in the following manner:
    
    		Exams	20% each, 60% total  
    		Exercises	5% each, 20% total  
    		Projects	10% each, 20% total  
    		  
    The first two exams are scheduled during regular class meetings, the thirdexam will be held during the final exam period.  The  exams will cover theassigned readings as well as material presented in class.  Exams arenon-cumulative.  The exercises and laboratory projects for the course areintended to give you familiarity with the quantitative researchmethodologies of psychology and how to use the scientific literature ofpsychology to answer your own questions.  Assignments and their due dateswill be distributed in class.  Late assignments are penalized by apoint-subtraction system.
    
    Class discussions are intended to augment the assigned readings and notmerely mimic them; thus, you are responsible for the material covered inboth.  During class, familiarity with the material is assumed and thus thereading assignments must be completed before class.  Participation in classdiscussion can influence your final grade favorably.   Class attendance isrequired.

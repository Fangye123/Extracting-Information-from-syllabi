Attendance

_

Punctual attendance is required, and students arriving after roll is called
are considered absent. **Two unexcused absences are allowed.**   In order to
have absences excused, students should submit the appropriate signed form from
the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.  This form is also
required for the make-up of missed exams.  Each unexcused absence beyond the
two allowed will lower the class-participation component of the final grade.

_

Exams

_

Including the final, there are three exams in the course, each consisting of
multiple-choice questions, terms for identification, and one essay question.
Although I will try to have some spares available in case of emergencies,
please remember to bring at least one **small exam book** (blue book) to the
exams.    These are available in the campus bookstore.

_Discussion Sessions_

Class meetings on Fridays will normally be devoted to the discussion of
primary texts placed on reserve in the library.  All students are responsible
for reading the texts.  Additionally, two students each week will be asked to
prepare a **ten-minute presentation** introducing the text and suggesting
questions for further discussion.   The evaluation of student presentations is
included in the class participation component of the final grade for the
course.

_Reading Summaries_

Students are required to submit at least **five one-page summaries** of the
Friday reading assignments during the course of the semester.   The purpose of
these assignments is to ensure that students have read the texts and to
develop students' writing skills in preparation for the course essay (see
below).  Students may choose any five of the discussion topics listed above
but must submit papers at the beginning of class on the day of the discussion.

_

Essay_

There are two options for the essay assignment.  Students may either write an
essay on Zola's _The Debacle_ **or** prepare a comparative book review of two
historical works on a topic covered during the semester.  Students choosing
the latter option should have books approved by the instructor no later than
**Friday, March 1**.   Additional details concerning the essay assignment will
be published on the course web page by that date.  Essays should be
approximately seven or eight pages in length and are due **in class on
Wednesday, April 24**.

_

Academic Honesty_

All students are expected to maintain ethical integrity.  Any instance of
cheating or plagiarism constitutes grounds for the assignment of an F in the
course, and such cases will normally be reported immediately to both the Vice
President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs.

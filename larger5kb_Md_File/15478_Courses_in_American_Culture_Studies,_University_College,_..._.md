>  Amanda Lotz  
>  Since its widespread debut in the 1950s, television has become the primary
medium for the circulation of information and storytelling in American
society. This course takes a thorough look at the introduction of this art
form and explores its contributions to the American cultural imagination in
its first twenty years. We will view and analyze series from the 1950s and
1960s, and consider the representation of nation, family, gender, ethnicity,
and other issues debated in norms and policies of this era. We will also
examine the introduction of television into the home, exploring how an
appliance could affect notions of community and family. Students will leave
the class with an understanding of the complicated and contested role
television played in the establishment of the post-WWII economy and as a
mainstream artbiter of 1960s social movements. Prerequisite: see headnote.

>  Since the rediscovery of Kate Chopin's _The Awakening_ (1899) in the 1960s,
recuperations and rereadings of 19th-century American fiction by women have
multiplied enormously. The seminar will consider fictions from the period of
the Early Republic to The Awakening, with the first half of the semester given
to a survey of types (adventure and domestic fiction, the female bildungsroman
and growth-of-the-artist novels), formalist approaches ("reading the middle:"
and foiling the marriage plot), problematic issues of race, gender, and
language as these relate to constructions of subjectivity. The second half of
the semester will focus on specific texts and writers chosen from the survey
and elected for closer examination by seminar students. Among writers and
texts to be considered: Catharine Sedgwick, Lydia Maria Child, Fanny Fern's
Ruth Hall, Susan Warner's The Wide Wide World, E.D.E.N. Southworth's The
Hidden Hand, Louisa May Alcott's Behind A Mask, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Harriet
Spofford, Harriet Wilson's Our Nig, Frances Harper's Iola Leroy, Elizabeth
Stuart Phelps's The Story Of Avis, Elizabeth Stoddard's The Morgesons,

NOIR**  
>  U89 5217 AMCS 3 units $1020  
>  Sec. 1 - W 6:00-8:30 p.m. Eads 115  
>  Lutz Koepnick  
>  A product of highly diverse influences and traditions, film noir is known
for its stylized visual aesthetic, crackling dialogue, moral ambivalence, and
existential paranoia. Its style and language continue to inform filmmakers in
Hollywood and worldwide. This seminar positions the aesthetic shapes and
traumatic narratives of film noir within the context of American culture and
film history during the war and post-war years. As importantly, it explores
film noir as a test case in order to probe notions of film history, genre, and
authorship, of cultural transfer, national cinema, exile, and the popular.
Required screenings will take place during the second half of each week's
class. Films include: _The Maltese Falcon, Phantom Lady, Double Indemnity,
Laura, Sunset Boulevard,_ and _Chinatown._ Prerequisite: see headnote. Same as
U98 MLA 5217. Course page:

**HI2104    Contemporary World History**

![](GreatWave.jpg)  [CHRONOLOGY,
1688-1995](http://dibner.poly.edu/digital_library/tmp/151.204.199.98_09_07_00_13_17/chronology%20routing.htm)  
Professor Soffer put together a chronology of world history.  It includes
links to short pieces on particular events or people, and some primary souces.
You might find it helpful.  Don't be confused by the "Back to Syllabus" link.
That is Professor Soffer's syllabus, not ours.  |   [Internet Modern History
Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html)  
Many of our primary sources come from here.  There are many, many others and
also links to sources on East Asian history, Indian history, Women's history
and others.  It is a very nice browse.

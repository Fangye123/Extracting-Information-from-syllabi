_**Course Description**_

S545 is the foundation of the Associate Instructor training program of the
Department of Communication and Culture. The course introduces graduate
students to teaching speech communication, with a particular emphasis on
teaching public speaking. Intended primarily for inexperienced instructors,
the course focuses on teaching fundamentals, including lecturing, leading
discussions, using audio-visual aids, writing examination questions, and
dealing with interpersonal problems in the classroom. Although the course is
practical, students will be exposed to theory and research on teaching and
learning in areas relevant to their early teaching assignments. Several topics
will be discipline-specific, focusing on the oral and written criticism of
student speeches, communication apprehension, and the place of speech
communication in the liberal arts and sciences curriculum.

In conjunction with taking S545, students will also attend S121 staff
meetings, during orientation week and continuing throughout the semester.

Readings for the class may be purchased from **Mr. Copy** on East Tenth
Street. **The articles listed each day should be read prior to the next class
meeting.** Other materials will be distributed during class.

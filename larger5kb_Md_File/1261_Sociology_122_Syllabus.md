### Course Outline

This course is an introduction to Africa. While our attention and work is
centered on the continent of Africa, at every major step we will be moving
outward to the larger African world and Europe/North America--hence the title
"Africa in World Perspective".

Over the course of the semester we will move across issues critical to the
study and understanding of this larger African world, with particular
attention to the Africa's historic relation with and within Europe and North
America. Our focus will accordingly shift from initial groundings in the
contested meaning and study of "Africa/n" in contemporary North American and
Africa, including our educational systems, through the great states and
civilizations of the continent, to larger transnational understandings of the
eras of enslavement, colonialism, and the postcolonial order. We will conclude
with topical examinations of current policy and political debates within the
continent and the United States.

This is a demanding endeavor as we will be engaging with contentious and often
charged debates, including for example the racialization of
"Black/White/African," mis/education about Africa, slavery and reparations,
patriarchy, and cultural interpretations across racial and continental
divides. Readings, lecture, video and internet/world-wide materials have been
selected with care, in order to present multiple perspectives. Frank, open,
even passionate discussion is encouraged--with the proviso that respect for
divergent voices and viewpoints must be granted.

### **Discovery, Computer, African Links as Features of the Course

**

This course has three additional features this semester. One, it is a
Discovery course, which permits us to have a small class (most African-related
courses are heavily over-enrolled). Two, special advanced computer features
have been built into the course. Students will be required to learn the use of
the internet, world-wide-web, and FirstClass software. These will allow us all
to tap directly, for example, into daily African newspapers and other African-
sourced materials, opening the door to a world of voices rarely available to
North American students. We will also use computer communication techniques
for collaborative projects and reports. Three, we will be linked, via a
listserver and e-mail, with students at the University of the Western Cape, a
Histoically Black South African university in Cape Town.

It is neither assumed nor required that students be familiar with the computer
technologies.

During the first three weeks of the course special workshops during class
hours will be conducted in the OCCSS computer lab, with each student having
her or his own computer station. Additional assistance and workshops on
FirstClass will also be provided by SCALE (see handout). The instructors will
also be available for yet further individual assistance throughout the course.
We have been careful in our design of computer materials, and while we expect
surprises, students of all skill levels will be given every assistance
possible.

### **Texts and Readings

**

No commercial text covers the subjects and perspective of this course. Two
works of fictdion have been assigned:

  * A novel: Nervous Conditions by Tsitsi Dangaremba 
  * A collection of short stories: Adjusted Lives by F. Odun Balogun 
We will read all of Nervous Conditions and most of Adjusted Lives. These are
available at a discount from the student-run bookstore, Afrikan Institutions,
which is located on the third floor of the African-American Cultural Program
house, 708 S. Mathews. They will be selling the two books at this location
during the first two weeks of class, M-F 10am.-4pm. After this date call
359-9225.

Most of our reading is contained in a packet available from Notes-n-Quotes,
Johnstone Centre, 502 E. John. Copies of the two books and the reading packet
have been placed on reserve in the undergraduate library.

### **[The Course Film Series](filmlist.htm) and other Extra Credit Events

**

We will watch and discuss in class excerpts from many videos related to
Africa. Three films will also be required; these will be shown in the evening
and are available for individual viewing in the Undergraduate Media Library
for those who cannot make the evening showings.

In addition a film series has been constructed that parallels the course. Play
dates and film titles are listed in the film flyer as well as on the course
web page. There are also many valuable events related to Africa on this
campus.

For each of the non-required films and other approved events, students are
offered the opportunity of attending the event and writing a 2-3 page, double-
spaced, report. Reports should be electronically mailed via FirstClass, by
5pm. on the Monday following the event; grades will be returned
electronically. You must keep a copy; makeups will not be granted for lost
copies.

Events will be announced in class as they become available and will be posted
on the course web page. Students are encouraged to suggest upcoming events on
African subjects for approval, but requests must be made well before the event
to allow for announcement to other students, and the event must relate to
Africa and be open to the public at no cost.

Reports should (1) briefly summarize the event and (2) provide a critical
assessment of what was presented and what you have learned in relation to
course themes and discussions. Reports will be graded, with up to 1 full point
being possible for each report. A maximum of 5 reports per student is
permitted; it is thus possible to earn up to 5 additional points (i.e., in
addition to the 100 possible points from required course work); accumulated
points will be added to students' grades after final grade distributions have
been done at the end of the semester.

### **Course Requirements and Grade Components

**

For this course there is no midterm, no cumulative final, no single large
research paper. That is the good news! Course assignments have been designed
instead to encourage steady, continuous and collaborative work. There are thus
frequent small exercises through the semester, which will allow you to gauge
your work and grade as we proceed through the semester. Course work is
composed of short submissions targeting readings and discussions, quizzes, and
three short essay assignments. Course grades will be compiled from the
following work:

  * Class participation: includes the following and is worth 25% of the grade: 

    * attendance and participation 
    * short weekly comments on the abstracts posted on the FirstClass conference 
    * completion of short assignments exploring African voices on the internet/web 
    * report-backs in class on conversations with South African students 
  * Quizzes: 13 weekly quizzes, with the best ten grades will be compiled to account for 25%. These are 10 minute, short answer questions. We will take the best ten of thirteen grades and thus you may drop the worst grades. Each quiz covers the reading for the week of the quiz. 

  * Two abstracts of class readings with questions for guiding discussions: 20%. these follow a regular format (see schedule below and guidelines on FirstClass).

  * Three 3-4 page take-home essay assignments: 30%. These are on set topics and draw upon course readings and discussions; extra reading or research is neither expected nor required. 
Make-ups or late papers/abstracts/postings will only be permitted if there is
a documented excuse.

### Schedule and Due Dates

Note: excludes assignment of Abstracts which vary for each person.

**Abstracts** (See also abstracting guide sheet and first abstract example on
FirstClass.) Groups will be assigned during the second week of class. Each
group posts twice. Groups are responsible for examining the responses to their
questions, and then raising replies/questions in class.

**Course Description:**

This course examines how and why religion and science struggle to discover the
truth. We will wrestle with certain important questions. Is there a God? What
are we doing on a planet that is floating in space? How did we get here? Are
we here by accident or design? Are we humans (at) the center of the universe?
Should we or can we speak of God in an age of Science? Are there or should
there be moral limits that constrain both religion and science as they search
for the Truth? These and other questions will be explored in conversation with
the professors. The course invites us to reflect on the place of ourselves,
our learning, our past, and our future in a universe of chaos, order, and
mystery; on scales vast and minute; in relationships cosmic and personal,
contingent and purposeful. What does it mean to be a faithful child of God
(people of God) in a scientific age? Particular attention will be given toward
constructing imaginative and creative responses to these and other questions.

**Class schedule**

8:30-9:50 Tu Th (GSC 201)

**Disabilities**

Any students with disabilities who need reasonable accommodation in this
course are encouraged to speak with the instructors as soon as possible.

**Attendance**

Regular class attendance is expected. Excessive absence will affect your grade
adversely. Class begins at 8:30. Please make every effort to be here on time.

**Classroom style**

The methodology of the class will include: some lectures, free-for-all
discussion as an entire class, small group discussion, online discussion among
students and faculty. There may be some limited use of films, art, music,
local field trips, etc. Students are responsible for reading all the books
listed. The exams will cover the readings. Professors generally will not be
lecturing on the books. If you have questions or comments on the readings feel
free to include them in our class discussions. The exams will include long and
short essay questions dealing with the readings, lectures, and discussions of
the class.

**Note:** anyone in class should feel free to raise any questions at any time.
Feel free to interrupt.

**Grade lines**

B/C      80  
C/D      65  
D/F      55

\+ and - grades extend + 3% from these borderlines.  
Thus A- is 90.0-92.99%, B+ is 87.0-89.99%.

In case a student chooses S/U grading, the Registrar translates C- or better
as a grade of S, and D+ or lower as U.

**Star Day-Sun Day observational exercise**

Instructions are posted. Begin the observations promptly, and reflect on what
you are observing. You are welcome to discuss your results with other class
members. The report is done individually, and is posted on your web site.
**Due March 13.**

**Term Paper**

Choose a topic, issue, or theme which is related to science and religion, and
develop it into a substantial term paper. Length should be the equivalent of
8-12 pages, double spaced. This is a research paper, in that your sources of
information should be thoroughly documented through detailed footnotes or end
notes. Bibliographic citations must be done consistently. State explicitly
which style you are following, and stick to it. Recommended styles include
MLA, _The Chicago Manual of Styl_ e, the journal _Zygon_ , or one of the
journals published by the American Chemical Society. To use some other style,
get the approval of the instructors. This is also a reflective position paper.

By **March 1** submit your Term Paper **topic** and 3 references for the
instructors' approval. Post the completed term paper on your web site no later
than **May 1**. Drafts identified as such may be posted as you develop them,
and you may request instructors' comments. . You are welcome to hand in a
printed copy of the final paper if you wish.

**Capstone Portfolio Web Pag** e

One of the requirements of this Capstone is that each student develop a
Capstone Portfolio Web Page, as part of their individual home page.

The nature and objectives of this web page can be tailored to your own
particular interests, through specific agreement with the instructors, but
there are several expected components.

The Capstone Portfolio Web Page should pull together your activities in this
course. In it, document.your growing understanding of and reflections on
issues related to the concerns of this science and religion Capstone. The
Portfolio as a whole should be more than the sum of its parts.

AV will create an overall General 492H Capstone home page for this course,
with links to each class member's home page, at URL
**http://inst.augie.edu/~viste/capstone2001/** Quite a number of students in
this Capstone already have developed a Home Page of their own in some form. If
this is new for you, speak with your knowledgeable classmates and with AV.
Some suggestions for getting started on a web page are available at URL
**http://inst.augie.edu/~viste/webstart.html** We recommend that you work on
your web page using simple tools such as Netscape, rather than excessively
fancy software packages such as Front Page. We expect that you should
understand the structure of your web site quite thoroughly, through having
constructed it, rather than letting a fancy software package proliferate files
and subdirectories all across creation.

You may also want to incorporate some of your personal, career, or avocational
interests, particularly as they intersect the concerns this course. Certainly
the web page should reflect your own personality. It should be obvious that
this needs to be your own work, in consultation with AV as necessary. Using a
"hired gun" to create a flashy web page for you would be worth zero points.
Thus the web page should include a statement of authorship, and a virtual
signature of some sort.

Your web page should include **at least** the following:

Star Day-Sun Day observational exercise  
Term Paper  
Essays rewritten from Exams 1 and 2  
Links to interesting web sites related to this Capstone course  
Essay on your own perspective on relationships between science and religion  
You are welcome to add more.

**Academic Integrity**

We expect that this class will embody and live up to appropriately high
standards of academic integrity. An unpleasant and very partial way to say
this is that we expect you to avoid cheating on exams and plagiarism in your
writing. But we would rather look on the positive side. One of the fruits of
this course is intended to be reflection on the question, " **How then shall
we live?** " Our hope is that this will be so deeply ingrained that your faces
will be radiant with the light of integrity! If there are situations which are
fraught with uncertainty, please discuss them with the instructors or with the
class as a whole. Certainly there are frequent occasions, such as small group
discussion, where group work and interaction are strongly encouraged and
expected.

**Participation and Nicene** t

Your active participation throughout this course is expected and valued. This
may take a variety of forms, including class discussion based on keeping up
with the reading, sharing personal points of view in and out of class, and
making steady progress on your web page.

It is also manifested in your involvement in class interaction through
Nicenet. This Virtual Communal Space will be implemented using Nicenet, with
ICA software (Internet Classroom Assistant). At least at the beginning, the
instructors (AV and MJH) will pose a weekly question or topic for conversation
and discussion. Each class member is expected to make at least one
contribution each week (Sunday - Saturday). However we hope that this
conversation takes on a life of its own, with new conversation topics
(threads) arising out of the class discussion as well.

To get started, use a web browser (typically Netscape or Internet Explorer) to
connect to this URL: **http://www.nicenet.org/**  
The instructors (AV) have set up a  "class" on Nicenet, called "Capstone2001".
You have already been added to the class roster. Log in, but do not attempt to
jin the class a second time. In most cases your Usemame is the same as your
e-mail login at Augie. Thus Ole N. Viking is onviking. Your Password is your
student ID (6 digits). The instructors' Usemames are simply viste and haar
(just as on the e-mail system at Augie).

**PURPOSE AND SCOPE**

* * *

This course, now in its tenth year, focuses on current plant practices to
convert metal-containing wastes to byproducts. Processors, raw materials, and
markets are identified and quantified. Instructors with decades of hands-on
experience detail use of multiple approaches to recycling metals and
associated materials - backed up by slides, videos, and a 900-page syllabus.

Particular emphasis is given to combinations of physical, hydro-metallurgical,
and pyrometallurgical processing to facilitate economical recycling. The
presentations are on a practical level, focusing on plant operations, with
ample opportunity for participant interaction.

**Course Objectives:**

Accounting 3120 is the second of three classes designed to provide a
comprehensive knowledge of the accounting principles and theory related to the
financial information that is reported to users outside of the company. This
class concentrates on financial accounting for corporations and emphasizes the
liability and owners' equity sections of the balance sheet, the related income
statement issues, and the statement of cash flows.

**Homework Assignments:**

Students are expected to study the assigned reading for the day and come to
class prepared to discuss the assigned material. An honest attempt to work
**all** assignments before they are covered in class is critical to your
understanding of the material and your success in the course. The assigned
homework is a minimum requirement of the course. Copies of the solution manual
are posted on my web page at
**[www.utoledo.edu/~dfranz/](http://www.utoledo.edu)**.

Periodically a homework assignment may be picked up or a quiz given. These
will usually be announced or given as take-home projects. There will be a
sufficient number of these assignments so that everyone will be able to drop
their lowest score in the computation of their final score for this portion of
the grade.

**Exams:**

Three midterm exams and a comprehensive final exam are scheduled (dates
indicated on the next page of the syllabus). Copies of prior mid-term exams
are available on my web page. All exams are closed-book. Programable
calculators may not be used during exams.

No make-up exams will be given. Any test missed will be assigned a grade of
zero unless you present, on a timely basis (normally within 24 hours of the
scheduled exam time), sufficient evidence that your absence was because of
extenuating circumstances beyond your control. Should you have a sufficient
reason, you will be assigned the same percentage score for the missed exam as
you earn on the comprehensive final exam.

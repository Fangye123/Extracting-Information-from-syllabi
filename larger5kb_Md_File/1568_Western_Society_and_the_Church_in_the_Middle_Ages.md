**THE COURSE AND ITS GOALS**  
 &nbspThrough; common readings of various description and individual reports
on key texts, events, and figures, we will explore the relations of
Christianity to the social environments in which it evolved from late
antiquity to the thirteenth century. Topics include conversion, monasticism,
sanctity and hagiography, miracles and relics, the papacy, crusade,
pilgrimage, and education. There will be special attention to the roles and
achievements of women in medieval Christian life.  
  Each week will begin with 60-90 minutes of focussed discussion on the common
readings. The remainder of the time will be spent in student reports, which
will range from 10-20 minutes depending on the scope of the assignment. There
will be no formal lectures. Therefore your individual preparation and your
readiness to discuss the common readings and the topics on which you agree to
report will determine the success of the course meetings. Written assignments
are cumulative, meant to develop skills in source analysis, research, and
expository writing.  
**REQUIREMENTS**  
  
  
  * Active participation in discussions of common reading 
  * 2 (undergraduate) or 3 (graduate) oral reports on texts and topics

   For bibliographic help with reports and formulation of research topics, you
will find the _New Catholic Encyclopedia_ and _The Dictionary of the Middle
Ages_ , both in the reference section in Tisch Library, good places to begin.
(Like any other reference works, they make poor places to begin **and** end.)
The Lynch textbook also has a good bibliography. Your instructor wants to help
you however possible, and will usually be able to answer email queries
promptly.

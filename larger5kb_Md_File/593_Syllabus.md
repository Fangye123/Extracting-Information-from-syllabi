**Course Requirements** :

The course requirements are as follows: there are two midterms. The first will
take place on October 9 and will be a closed-book exam conducted in class. The
second will take place in the 12th week and will be an open-book take-home
exam. An essay question will be handed out on November 13, with essays due
back in class on November 15. Although students are free to consult any
written sources, they may not discuss their papers with other students,
advisers, tutors, friends, virtual friends on the internet, or professors.
Read what you want but don't talk with anyone.

The first midterm will cover material from the start of the course, and the'
second, material since the first midterm. Each of these exams will count 20%
of the final grade, participation in section discussions will count 20%, and
the final exam 40%. The final exam is cumulative. The last drop date is
September 12 and the last date to withdraw from the course is October 24.
Students taking the course credit/no credit must receive at least the grade of
straight C in order to receive credit.

Students are expected to attend section meetings. Absence from any section
meeting, regardless of reason, will be graded zero unless the student submits
a written review (500 words) of the material assigned for the missed section
to the teaching assistant in charge by the Tuesday following the section
meeting missed.

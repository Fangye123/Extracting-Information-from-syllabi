COURSE OBJECTIVE:

> Economics 403/603 is an extension of Economics 303 and deals with selected
303-topics in greater deal as well as introduces new topics. The overall
objective is to further acquaint the student with the financial environment of
the U.S. economy. Since the financial environment is in transition, the topics
considered in Economics 403 frequently change from course offering to course
offering. This year's course focuses on three topics related to the current
economic and financial environment of the U.S. economy:

I. Level and structure of interest rates

II. The Role of the Federal Reserve in the Great Depression and Current Views
on the Role of Central Banking at the end of the 20th Century.

III. Financial Policy and Central Banking in Japan and the Asian economic and
financial crisis of 1997 and 1998.    REQUIRED READING: 1\. Xeroxed materials.

2\. Thomas F. Cargill, Michael M. Hutchison, and Takatoshi Ito. _Financial
Policy and Central Banking in Japan_. The MIT Press, forthcoming. (included in
xeroxed materials)

3\. Thomas F. Cargill, Michael M. Hutchison, and Takatoshi Ito. _The Political
Economy of Japanese Monetary Policy_. The MIT Press, 1997.    SUGGESTED
READING: Students are encouraged to review to the _Wall Street Journal_ at
least a few times each week. The _Journal_ is available in the library;
however, any student interested in the U.S. economy should consider
subscribing to the _Journal_ and reading it on a regular basis. Student rates
are very low. Other suggested sources of information include three government
publications and the Internet:  
Government Publications: _Federal Reserve Bulletin_ published monthly by the
Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System; quarterly review and other
publications published by each of the 12 Federal Reserve District Banks;
_Survey of Current Business_ published monthly by the Department of Commerce;
and _The Economic Report of the President_ published yearly by the Council of
Economic Advisors. These, with a few exceptions, are available in the library.

Internet: There is a tremendous amount of information available on the
Internet with regard to many of the topics discussed in this course. Students
are encouraged to log on to one of the search engines and find the home pages
of the following: Federal Reserve System, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics,
U.S. Department of Commerce, and the Bank of Japan. Spend an hour or so on the
Internet visiting these sites and you will discover the rich source of
information that can be used to supplement your business and general
education.  
  COURSE REQUIREMENTS There will be two written examinations (midterm and
final) and a paper, each worth 100 points.   The midterm examination will
cover material in Section I and II. The final will cover material in Section
III and will.   The paper will consist of two parts. The first part will be a
summary of issues and concerns of the Federal Reserve and the second will be a
summary of issues and concerns of the Bank of Japan. The information for this
paper will come directly from lectures and your search of the Internet. No
other research materials are required. The purpose of the paper is to acquaint
the student with economic and financial issues in the two largest economies in
the world and to familiarize the student with the Internet as a research tool.
The paper is due the last official class day and is worth 100 points.   COURSE

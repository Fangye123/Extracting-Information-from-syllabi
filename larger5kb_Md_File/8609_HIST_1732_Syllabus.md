## HIST 1732

### An environmental history course. The Amazon Basin has been neglected by
historians, but not by natural scientists. This course is designed to add a
historical dimension to the study of Amazonian environments, using
environmental change as a way of approaching the economic, social and
political history of the region. It aims to give students a historically
informed view of a region often presented stereotypically as a natural
wilderness, allowing them to go behind current debates on deforestation and
biodiversity. A conference course open to graduates and advanced
undergraduates.

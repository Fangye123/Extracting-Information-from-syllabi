---|---  
  
After a brief survey of West African history and culture and the growth of the
colonial economies of Western European nations, this course will introduce you
to the major political, social, and cultural developments in the history of
African Americans from 1619 through Reconstruction. We will consider the
relationship between slavery and racism; explore colonial slavery as practiced
in the North, the Chesapeake, and the Carolinas; and discuss the impact of the
Revolution on this institution. However, the course will concentrate on
slavery in the antebellum South in an attempt to understand the community
slaves created for themselves within the plantation system. Finally, we will
look at the rise of abolitionism and the African-American experience during
the Civil War and Reconstruction.

CLASS PARTICIPATION

This class will be run partially as a seminar. Each week, after I give a
fairly short lecture, we will discuss the assigned readings. Therefore, the
class cannot be successful without your active involvement. Your participation
in class discussions is required. You are to come to class prepared to talk
about the readings. Class participation will account for approximately 15% of
your grade.

READER-RESPONSE PAPERS

Each week you are to turn in a reader-response paper -on the assigned readings
at the beginning of the class. These are short, informal papers giving your
reactions to the various readings. I will grade them on content, not on style
or grammar. Should you fail to turn in a paper on time or if the paper fails
to demonstrate that you have read the assignments, you will receive a zero.
These papers will account for approximately 20% of your grade.

EXAMINATIONS

There will be one midterm and one final examination. The midterm will count
for about 20% of your grade. It will be based on reading assignments, lectures
and discussions and will consist of both essay and identification questions.
There will also be a take-home final examination intended to make you
synthesize the course in some fashion. You will have at least a week to
prepare it, and it will be DUE ON MAY IO. It will count for approximately 20%
of your final grade.

PAPER

In addition to the reader-response papers, each student will write a research
paper of 8 - 10 pages. Select a topic relevant to this course in consultation
with the instructor. Do not Just narrate events. Rather, put forward a thesis
and defend your position. You must pick your topic before class on MARCH 8.
You must turn in a thesis statement and at least three supporting arguments
you will use to defend your thesis on APRIL 5. The paper is DUE ON APRIL 19.
The instructor does not look kindly on late papers and, if she accepts them at
all, lowers the grade accordingly.

The paper will count for approximately 25% of your grade.

STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES

Students with disabilities are to provide their letters of certification and
accommodation within the first two weeks of class. The Disability Services
Office is part of Student Support Services, Main Hall 132. Phone: 262-3065.

PLEASE NOTE

To pass this course you must complete ALL assignments. Plagiarism on papers or
examinations will be severely punished. At a minimum, it will result in an F
for the course. Incompletes (IFs) will not be given unless the instructor has
granted prior approval or a genuine emergency exists. It is your
responsibility to contact the instructor before finals week should you need to
take an incomplete and explain why one is necessary. She may or may not grant
one.

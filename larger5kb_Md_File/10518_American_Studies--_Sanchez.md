  * Schedule
**Course Description:**

> This course will explore a variety of themes, theoretical influences, and
methodological approaches currently alive in American Studies, and its related
disciplinary fields. My aim is to introduce you to a wide array of ongoing
"conversations" in the field of American Studies, with the hope of promoting
active engagement in those discussions from you. Particular emphasis is placed
on the current controversies and scholarship surrounding the area of cultural
studies and scholarship focused on race, ethnicity, gender and sexuality.

> The course is organized around four three-week sections, each designed to
explore a particular approach in American Studies. "Foundations" will
introduce some basic conceptual building blocks in the field, as well as
explore some of the historical development of American Studies. "Space" will
look at several current controversies centered around geographic/spatial
issues in a variety of subfields. "Identity" will explore various approaches
to the relationship between the individual and the larger community, focusing
on questions of race and sexuality. "Power" examines the various hierarchies
in American contemporary society, as well as strategies employed to overturn
those hierarchies.

Requirements:

> There are four categories of obligation in this course:

>

>   1. doing the required readings and actively participating in each weekly
discussion

>   2. two written book reports which will be distributed to everyone in class

>   3. leading a discussion for one session

>   4. 15-20 page "think piece" paper on a interdisciplinary question we have
chosen together

  * Categories 1 & 2 each will make up 20% of the final grade; 
  * discussion facilitation 10%; 
  * and the paper 50%. 
Every three weeks you will be asked to submit written work delineating the
progress of your paper:

  1. one page statement describing the interdisciplinary issues your paper will address (due Oct. 7th); 
  2. a working bibliography of the books & articles central to your paper (due Oct. 28st); 
  3. a five page draft of text taken from anywhere in the paper (due Nov. 18th); 
  4. the final paper (due Dec. 9th). 

> Everyone enrolled in this course will also be part of a computer conference
group which will allow us to communicate with each other as a class between
our weekly core meetings. This conference is your opportunity to get early
feedback on readings, share insights from disciplinary backgrounds, ask
questions of each other, and raise issues not covered in the meetings. I think
you will benefit from this electronic interaction, as well as contribute to
the overall intellectual experience of the course.

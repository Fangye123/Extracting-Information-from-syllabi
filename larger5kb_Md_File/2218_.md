Fall Term 2001 (Sections 001 and 002)  
Professor Samuel Pearson  

This course surveys the social, economic, political, and constitutional
development of the United States from European discovery and colonization to
1877. It is a "survey" course that examines the American past from a variety
of perspectives in order to encourage student thinking about both the history
of this nation and the nature of history as an academic discipline. Classes
meet on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Section 001 meets from 8:00 to 8:50
a.m. in PB 3302. Section 002 meets from 9:00 to 9:50 in PB3313.  

The primary textbook is Out of Many by John Mack Faragher et al. This is a
narrative history of the United States to 1877. It is supplemented by a
reader, America Firsthand by Robert D. Marcus and David Burner. Both books are
available in textbook rental. Students with access to internet may find
helpful review materials supplementing the textbook at the web site
http://www.prenhall.com/faragher. There is a link to this site from my web
page at http://www.siue.edu/~spearso.  

Lectures will be general in scope. They will be arranged chronologically and
will complement, clarify and explicate materials included in the textbook and
reader. Students are responsible both for assigned readings and for classroom
lectures. While the primary objective of the course is to add to your
understanding of the history of this nation and its people, I also expect you
to gain an understanding of how historians work and of some of the major
historiographical issues that divide historians as they study the history of
America to the mid-nineteenth century. The documents in the reader complement
the narrative text, and you will find these documents useful as you think
about major themes developed in the textbook and in class. The written
assignments based on the reader will enable you to try your own hand with
being a historian, i.e., with analyzing and evaluating a variety of materials
addressing a single topic.  

Students are expected to complete assigned readings, to submit the required
two short papers, and to attend regularly and participate in class. Grades
will be based on the two papers (15% each) and three examinations (23.3%
each). Absences from class in excess of three will lower a student's final
grade by 1% per absence. The examinations will cover material presented in the
classroom as well as assigned readings. They will include both essay and
multiple-choice questions, and students will be provided with a list of essay
topics from which examination questions will be taken prior to each test. The
short papers will be your reflections on certain assignments from the reader
in the light of what you have learned about the topics addressed from text and
lectures. Specific assignments and a format for these papers is provided at
the end of the syllabus. Your papers should be thoughtfully prepared and meet
exacting writing standards.  

Students who have questions are always encouraged to ask. I want to be as
helpful as possible, but I am a historian, not a mind reader. If you do not
ask, I will not know your question. I welcome talks with students after class
or at other times that are mutually convenient. My office is in PB 0216, my
campus telephone extension is 3570, and my e-mail address is spearso@siue.edu.
My office hours are 10:00 to 10:30 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and by
appointment.

Format for Papers  

Your papers should be written carefully and thoughtfully with due attention to
the subject matter, style, spelling, and punctuation. I expect you to read the
assigned selections in America Firsthand and related materials in Out of Many.
Note that the reader is designed to provide you, with respect to each topic, a
variety of source materials that might be of use to you or any student of
history in trying to understand that topic. Read and outline the assigned
selection and then write a short paper reflecting on the issue(s) raised. Your
personal views are welcome, but your views must indicate that you have read
the assigned selections and reflected upon them. Each of your papers should be
no less than three and no more than five double-spaced and typewritten pages.
Papers cannot be accepted after those submitted on the due date have been
returned, but students with a legitimate excuse for not meeting the deadline
will be assigned an alternative topic. Further information regarding the
preparation of papers is available at my web site.

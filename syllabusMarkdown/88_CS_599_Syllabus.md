# Overview

Over the past decade, the world of computing has moved from large, static,
desk-top machines to small, mobile, palm-top, and embedded devices.  The
methods, techniques, and tools for developing software systems that were
successfully applied in the former scenario are not as readily applicable in
the latter.  Software systems running on networks of mobile, embedded devices
must necessarily exhibit properties that are not always required of more
traditional systems: near-optimal performance, robustness, distribution,
dynamism, mobility.  This class will examine the key properties of software
systems in the embedded, resource constrained, mobile, and highly distributed
world.  The class will assess the applicability of mainstream software
engineering methods and techniques (e.g., object-orientation, component-based
development, software architecture) to this domain.  While not the primary
focus of the class, enabling advances in other areas (e.g., embedded, real-
time operating systems, wireless networking, the Internet) will be studied
from a software application development perspective.  A class project will
give students hands-on experience with building software development
infrastructure and/or applications in this important domain.

Course requirements are

[1]   reading and reviewing assigned papers,

[2]   a presentation of one of the papers,

[3]   participation in class discussions,

[4]   final exam, and

[5]   a semester project.

* * *

# Readings

  * There is no textbook for the course.
  * Several papers (see the Schedule) will be used as the basis of the course.  All papers are available on-line. Furthermore, students tasked with presenting a particular topic may need to locate additional relevant papers as needed.
  * To aid your note taking, I will also make the lecture slides available on-line. Students in charge of a given presentation will be required to mail their slides to [me](mailto:neno@usc.edu) by _10 am_ of the day of the presentation. Students will be able to download the slides by going to the appropriate _Discussion Topic_ in the  Schedule.

# Assignments

---|---|---  
  
Paper reviews

|

You will be required to write 1-page reviews of each paper assigned in class,
starting with Week 4.  You are not required to provide reviews of the papers
marked as " _supplemental_ " and highlighted in the Schedule. Additionally,
these papers will not be presented in class.  However, extra credit questions
on the final exam may be based on these papers. Each paper review should

  1. summarize the paper,
  2. highlight its strengths,
  3. highlight its weaknesses, and
  4. point out its relevance to embedded software.

Each student will be allowed to miss up to _three_ reviews during the semester
without penalty.

|

15%  
  
Presentations

|

Each student will be required to collaborate with one or two classmates and
present the details of two papers and any accompanying information. The
presentation should include at least, but need not be restricted to the
material covered in the paper.  The presentation should also address the same
four categories as required for the paper reviews (summary, strengths,
weaknesses, and relevance to embedded software).  The presenters are
responsible for familiarizing themselves with the necessary additional
background information.  They are also responsible for staying within the time
allotted for the presentation.

|

20%  
  
Class participation

|

Students are expected to prepare for each class (by reading papers) and
actively participate in the discussions of the topics for which they are not
presenters.

|

10%  
  
Class project

|

Design and implementation of a novel application or development tool that
exploits one or more existing approaches to software engineering in the
context of embedded systems, demonstrates a novel idea in this domain, or
overcomes a known significant challenge posed by embedded systems. The class
project will be discussed in Week 4.

|

35%  
  
Examination

|

The written exam will assess the students' understanding of the material
covered in class.

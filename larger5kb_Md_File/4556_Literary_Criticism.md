###  **COURSE DESCRIPTION  
  
** The course in Literary Criticism has two closely allied goals: 1) a close
study of the HISTORY of literary commentary from Plato to the present; 2) a
practical survey of contemporary critical approaches and theory. The course
provides students not only an understanding of the great tradition of Literary
Criticism but a chance to reflect on their own literary and critical
interests.  
  

  * **The History of Literary Criticism: The study of the great tradition of critical commentary, beginning with Plato's attacks on poetry and ending with the writings of some important 20th critics, offers a history in miniature of literature and its sister arts thoughout the ages. All the big issues are raised: the ethical value of poetry; its impact--good and bad--on its various audiences; the relation of literature to science, philosophy, history and the other arts; high literary culture vs. low; the material base of aesthetic experience; gender and the question of the other--the list goes on. In this survey students also find some of the most memorable affirmations of the study of literature. You'll come to look at your selection of literature as a field of concentration in a whole new light.**

  * **Critical Approaches: Have you ever been perplexed (or perhaps delighted?) by coming across a particulalrly ingenious interpretation and wondering where in the world the teacher or writer came up with that reading? Welcome to the world of critical approaches, in which you'll study an impressive array of various schools of literay theory: scholarly; formalist; pyschologial; cultural; feminist; post-structuralist; hypertextual (lit. and the www). Our textbook does not just "theorize" about these approaches but applies them to clear readings of certain well-known, shorter literary works. You'll gain hands-on training in the practice of advanced literary interpretation and gain confidence in saying what you want to say.**

**GUIDELINES FOR THE OUTLINE REPORT**

  
  

**Each student will submit an outline report on a figure from the critical
tradition who is not covered on the syllabus. You can choose any critic from
the St. Martin anthology who is not on the syllabus. Or you can consult the
plentiful references and bibliographies in the Oxford _Critical Approaches_
text (this might be an especially good idea: as you read and become interested
in a given "approach," you could select a representative critic for further
study). Or you can choose a name from the list below (or see me if you have
another idea or choice):**

**Plotinus . . . Aquinas . . . St. Augustine . . . Dante . . . Ficino . . .
Pico . . . Corneille . . . Voltaire . . . Locke . . . Addison . . . Lessing .
. . De Stael . . . Barbauld . . . Blake . . . Schlegel . . . Hazlitt . . .
Schopenhauer . . . Emerson . . . Whitman . . . Hawthorne . . .Sainte-Beuve . .
. Taine . . . Nietzsche . . . Henry James . . . Bergson . . . Croce . . .
Dewey (I've ommitted 20th C. critics becasue they're mentioned so extensively
in our class texts).**

**Each outline will be in three parts:**

* **I. Background information: don't overdo the biography; place the figure briefly in the historical and intellectual context of his or her time. Education, association with other formative critics or movements--info. of this kind.**
* **Major critical formulations: the heart of you report. Drawing (quoting) from the text you've chosen, articulate _three or four_ of the critic's key ideas.**
* **Influence/Contribution to the Tradition: Briefly in a paragraph assess the importance of the critic in terms of influence and place in the tradition.**

  
**Each outline will also end with a Works Cited section. See my Plato report
as a sample outline.**

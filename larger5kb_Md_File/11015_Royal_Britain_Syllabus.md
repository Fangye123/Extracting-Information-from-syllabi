**Purpose of the Course** :  By listening to lectures by British experts on
the monarchy, by studying historical, artistic, and literary portraits of the
kings and queens, by visiting palaces, castles, educational institutions, and
churches associated with royal rule, and by highlighting the evolution of the
English constitution over the millennia, this course will focus on the ways in
which British monarchs have shaped political, social, economic, religious, and
intellectual developments in Great Britain from the Anglo-Saxons to the
present.

The Kings and Queens of England_** (London: National Portrait Gallery, 1998);

**Course Requirements** :  
        **Attendance and Class Participation** (20 percent)   
The lectures, field trips, and discussions planned for the course are
intellectually challenging and culturally enriching, and, to quote Queen
Victoria, "we will not be amused" if you miss them.  Students are required to
attend lectures and to participate in class fieldtrips and discussions.  Five
points will be subtracted from the final grade for each absence (royal policy
no longer allows for offenders to be hung, drawn, and quartered).  
        **Journal**   (30 percent)   
Every participant will be expected to keep a journal which will include
lecture summaries and response papers related to course visits (see [journal
worksheet](rbjournal.htm) for details on format and content).  Journals will
be due on 1 August and returned to students in September.  
        **Paper**   (25 percent)   
Students will be required to write a 8-10 page analytical paper on some aspect
of the British monarchy (see [paper worksheet](499paper.htm) for details on
format and content).  Papers will be due to the instructor by 27 September
2002.  
        **Final Exam**   (25 percent)   
A comprehensive final exam will be given on Thursday, 1 August.  Questions
will focus on course themes and will be taken from the lectures, readings,
discussions, and site visitations.  
        **Grading**   
The following grading scale will be used:  A = 90-100; B = 80-89, C = 70-79; D

**COURSE DESCRPTION:**  
Historical survey of art and architecture since 1450. The emphasis of the
course is on developments in Western Europe and North America before the 19th
century (with a brief overview of the 19th and 20th centuries) and the arts of
cultures worldwide (Asia, Africa, Indigenous Americas, the Pacific) to the
present.  
  
**REQUIRED:**  
**ART HISTORY,** Vol. Two. SECOND EDITION by Marilyn Stokstad. This is a BRAND
NEW edition and is very different from last year's text. Please be sure the
text you have is the SECOND EDITION, copyright 2002.  
_  
_**CLASS SYLLABUS** (what you are looking at right now!) This has ALL the
information you will need concerning the course, including exams and the paper
assignment. See links throughout the syllabus. **Please bring a printed copy
of these pages as well as printouts of the[Paper info ](FA202paper.html),
[Study Guide](../study.html), and[ Midterm #1 ](FA202mt1.html)to class on
Wednesday, January 16th**.

Class meetings will be organized around a lecture format with opportunities
for questions and discussion. It is essential that students read the assigned
sections in the text before the class meetings so they will be familiar with
the material in the text and be prepared for any pop quizzes (see below).
**Material from both the text and from class lectures is included in exams.**  
  
**Course goals:**  
1\. To recognize works of art from major world art traditions from around 1400
through the present, including the artist, title, and period and their
importance in the history of art  
2\. To appreciate the social, cultural, historical, political, and economic
factors which impact artists' choices in subject, symbolism, and style across
time and geography  
3 To investigate issues of gender, race, patronage, etc., as they relate to
the role of the artist and the production of art works  
4\. To develop skills for evaluating and analyzing works of art, both in terms
of their visual elements (line, color, composition, etc.) and in their
expressive content, their subject matter  
  
**Course requirements (read carefully).  
There are two tracks for this class. You choose the one you wish to pursue.  
  
****TRACK 1 (NON-PAPER):  
** 2 Midterm examinations (objective slide identification, essay): 60 points
each / 120 points total  
Final Exam* (objective slide identification, essay): 85 points  
Pop quiz/attendance:15 points needed to be accumulated through unannounced pop
quizzes worth 2 points each, and attendance.  
Total: 220 points possible  
  

**TRACK 2** ([PAPER info](FA202paper.html)): **  
2 Midterm examinations (objective slide identification, essay): 60 points each
/ 120 points total  
Final Exam* (objective slide identification, essay): 85 points  
Pop quiz/attendance:15 points needed to be accumulated through unannounced pop
quizzes worth 2 points each, and attendance.  
Paper assignment: 80 points  
Total: 300 points possible  
  
* Final Exam is scheduled for **Monday, May 6, 1:00-3:00 PM**.  
  
***REASONS WHY CHOOSING THE "PAPER TRACK" MAY BE A GOOD IDEA:**  
1) you need a paper for your writing portfolio  
2) you need practice in writing in general, in learning English, or both  
3) you don't "test" well, especially on multiple choice exams, but you do
write well; so choosing this option could definitely get you a better grade  
3) there is an art work that has always fascinated you and you want to know
more about it  
4) you enjoy the challenge and rewards of learning something in greater depth  
  
**The grades are not curved. You EARN your grade with each exam/assignment.**
Make-up examinations are given only for serious medical or family emergency
situations and must be taken within a reasonable time period after the test
has been given (preferably within one week). Please inform us before the exam,
if possible.  
  
**Failure to complete any component will result in a grade of ZERO for that
assignment. Cheating, including but not limited to the use of "crib sheets",
copying other student's work, or plagiarism, will result in FAILURE OF THE
COURSE**. Cheating involving other students will be referred to the
appropriate university officials.  
  
We are happy to accommodate special needs (physical, language, etc.). Please
see Dr. Ivory as soon as possible at the beginning of the semester.

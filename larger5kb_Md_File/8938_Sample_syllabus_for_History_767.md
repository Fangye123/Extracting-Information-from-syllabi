**Writing a Book Review**  

**I. HOW TO STRUCTURE YOUR ESSAY.**  

A. Include one substantive section which discusses the content of the book.
This should comprise no less than two, but no more than three pages of the
essay. Your audience should know, from your description, what the book
contains, as well as what it does not contain (and perhaps, should contain).  

Things to bear in mind (without explicitly stating them in the book review):
does the title accurately reflect the contents: in other words, does the title
claim a particular period (1494-1871), but only _really_ encompasses the 18th
century; or, does the title claim to cover military organization in New Spain,
but really only deals with Mexico City?  

B. Ask what were the objectives of the author? Were they successfully
achieved?  

C. For books published before 1994 in English: how was the book review
received (see section II below)? In order to answer this question, 1) you must
go to the _Social Sciences Citation Index_ and look up which books or articles
have cited this work. Make a xerox copy of these citations and TURN IN THE
PHOTOCOPY WITH YOUR ESSAY. 2) Then find one of the books or articles and read
what those authors say about the work, i.e.,  "a smashing, groundbreaking
study, indispensable for anyone interested in the location of every tree on
Little Round Top before and after Pickettis charge," or "this book fills in a
much needed gap in our knowledge: lose no time in reading it."  

D. For books published 1994-95 determine which books or authors were
acknowledged by the author as a major influence. Go to one of those books and
try to determine how you think that work helped to shape the book.  

**II. ADDITIONAL MATERIALS**  

A. As stated in section I. C (for books published before 1994), your essay
must be accompanied by the photocopy of the _Social Science Citation Index_
page. (If you have trouble using this source, see a Reference Librarian.)  

B. You must read other reviews on the book published in relevant journals. For
books published in 1994 or before, you will find those journal citations
either in: a) _America: History and Life_ (hard copy or on-line); b) _Wilson
Index_ (hard copy). After you have found the review citation, go to the
journal cited and photocopy that review. INCLUDE THAT PHOTOCOPY WITH YOUR
ESSAY.  

**III. FURTHER INFORMATION**  

A. Your grade will be based upon how effectively you complete the assignment
set forth above. Good syntax, spelling and style are also essential to your
grade. All essays must be typed and must not be less than five or more than
six pages. Use the spell check on your word processing program. **Each late
essay will lose one letter grade for each 24 hour period beyond the due date
and time**.  

B. For style, look at book reviews in the _New York Times Book Review_
section, published each Sunday, or in _The New York Review of Books_. Examine
the ways in which professional book reviews are constructed and see how, for
instance, the authors link the beginning and last paragraphs of their essay.

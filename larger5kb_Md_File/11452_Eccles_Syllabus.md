Course Title** : **Russian Schools: Alternative Paths to Reform  
Catalog Description** : The primary goal of this course is the advanced study
of Russian schools. The course is divided into six components, examining key
elements of the state, public opinion, civics, society, and the economy on
Russian education policy. The first area under study will be the degree to
which the Russian state finances its schools. The focus then shifts to
attitudes among Russian students about their schools and the society in which
they live in, followed by a look at civic education. Fourth, an elaborate
discussion of the social context of Russian schools, highlighting issues of
diversity, as well as some of the social ills which plague the nation, will be
given heavy emphasis. Fifth, we will examine the economic return on a Russian
education. Finally, we will conclude with an investigation of the overall
promise and hurdles facing Russian schools. Through these six above
components, the student should gain a greater appreciation for the role of the
state, the individual student, society, and the economy in determining the
effectiveness, efficiency, and equity of the Russian educational system.

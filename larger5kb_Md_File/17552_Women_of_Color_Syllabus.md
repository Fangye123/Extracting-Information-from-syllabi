**Course Description:**

This course examines gender, race, and class as categories of analysis for
understanding the experiences of individuals in U.S. society. In an attempt to
elucidate conceptions and ideas which shape cultural and sexual identities,
women of color will be our primary focus. By moving women of color from their
historically marginal position in the curriculum to the center of our
attention, we will begin to explore ways of transforming knowledge about
culture and society. Specific readings, discussion, and writing will center on
themes of identity, difference, and resistance in the lives and experience of
U.S. women of color.

**Weekly Schedule and Reading Assignments:** **Unit I: Identity** (Prof.
Griffin)

The first section of this course will be concerned with the problem of
identity and knowledge, i.e., with the question of how you are affects what
you can know. Our goal is to understand the issues of Identity Politics as
they bear on gender and race. We will examine the deconstruction of self-
identity as a "phallogocentric white western capitalist ideal which represses
the connectedness of human beings." We will also explore the neo-conservative
implication of this deconstruction of self-identity as it functions to
disempower individuals and groups.

"What is involved in the project of rescinding borders is a critical awareness
of how borders have been (and continue to be) systematically policed and for
whose ideological benefit and material profit. The way to rescind borders is
of course to cross them, and in doing so, blur them, confuse them, make them
permeable, open for traffic from all directions, and, as a result, realize
that they have in fact been open all along, crossed by illegal traffic of all
kinds--in short, that differences of the kind that do not settle down into
binaries have already proliferated in our own backyards." \--Vera Kutzinski

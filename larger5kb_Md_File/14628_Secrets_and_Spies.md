COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course will survey spy literature from the eighteenth to twentieth
century. While including familiar examples of the genre-such as Ian Fleming's
_From Russia, With Love_ and _Tomorrow Never Dies_ (both featuring James
Bond)-the primary focus of the course will be on some lesser known precursors
and relatives of the traditional spy novel or movie. Moving chronologically,
the course will begin with an investigation of one possible origin of writing
about spies: the 18th-century epistolary travelogue. Reading both
Montesquieu's _The Persian Letters_ and Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's _The
Turkish Embassy Letters_ , we will look at how non-European characters were
imagined as spies to comment on weaknesses in European society.

Continuing to explore the theme of the foreign in the midst of the familiar,
we will turn next to James Fenimore Cooper's _The Spy_ , which many have
argued is the first example of what became the contemporary spy novel. Post-
revolutionary America was a fertile ground for fantasies of treason, and both
Cooper and Catharine Maria Sedgwick ( _Hope Leslie_ ) explore the boundaries
of friend and foe in a territory still being struggled over by colonists and
Native Americans.

In the third part of the course, we will move back across the Atlantic to two
novels that are also acknowledged as foundational to the genre of the spy
novel: Rudyard Kipling's _Kim_ and Joseph Conrad's _The Secret Agent_. Both
fantasies of imperial expansion, these works exemplify spy literature's
fraught relationship with the other.

Finally, in the last part of the class, we will return to focus primarily on
non-traditional spy literature. About a African American woman who tries to
masquerade as white, Nella Larsen's _Passing_ explores how racial minorities
in America are often thought of as enemies coming from within. Similarly,
David Henry Hwang's _M. Butterfly_ will allow us to talk about Asians and
Asian Americans as objects of stereotype and hate in the racial imaginary of
the U.S. Finally, we will watch _Tomorrow Never Dies_ and read _From Russia,
With Love_ to discuss the evolution of the James Bond genre from Cold War
clash to global battle.

ASSIGNMENTS

One of the main goals of this class will be to help you improve as readers of
literary texts and writers of literary analysis. Not only will we be doing a
lot of reading for the class (the assigned texts on the syllabus) but also we
will be completing a substantial amount of written work. For all of your
assignments, you will receive feedback from both your classmates and me. The
point of the written work in this class is to help you learn how to analyze
literature and express your thoughts in clear and cogent prose.

Specifically, there will be **six major requirements** for this course:

1) **Class participation (10%)**. This course will be run as a seminar, and,
as a result, you should come to each class ready to share and discuss your
thoughts with others. One technique I would suggest to prepare for class: as
you read, formulate a question about whatever it is you're reading and try to
answer it (i.e., note some passages that provide evidence for an argument
you'd make).

Your class participation grade will be based in part on your engagement with
our daily discussions about the readings. It will also be based on your
participation in the two writing workshops planned for the semester. In these
workshops, we will discuss examples of work done by people in the class (all
examples will be anonymous). We will address not only specific suggestions for
the particular essays under review but also general principles for writing
literary analyses. Some of the issues we will touch upon include close
reading; the relation of primary to secondary texts; literary research; and
documentation and use of sources.

2) **Weekly response papers (1-2 pgs.) (10%)**. Each week, I will ask you to
turn in a short response to the readings we are doing in class. In these
papers, you should attempt to analyze a part of a text closely and carefully.
These papers are intended to help you practice your skills of literary
analysis. They will also enable you to get frequent feedback from me on how to
improve your writing and ideas.

3) **A short paper (3-5 pgs.) (15%)**. The short paper will allow you to try
your hand at a longer literary analysis for the first time in this class. The
paper is due early on in the term so that you can get a quick sense of what
areas in your writing need improvement and then spend the rest of the semester
working on them. You will both receive individual comments on your paper from
me and have a chance to discuss the paper in general during our first writing
workshop (to be held the week after the paper is due). The short paper may be
on any reading we have done in class; you also may develop one of your
response papers into the short paper.

4) **A revised version of the short paper (5-7 pgs.) (15%)**. In this class,
you will be revising your work frequently and substantially. Every piece of
writing can be improved, and every essay benefits from going through several
drafts (as well as being written over more than a brief period of time). For
the revised version of the short paper, then, I expect significant changes
from the first version. The revised version also should be somewhat longer
than the first version, as you will have thought more about the ideas you
initially expressed and subsequently developed them in additional writing. You
will notice that the revised version of the paper counts as much as the first
version: drafts and 'final' copies are equally important in the writing
process. After you have turned in the revised versions of your short papers,
we will have the second writing workshop of the semester to discuss some
examples of changes that can be made from one draft to another.

5) **A rough draft of the final paper (5-7 pgs.) (25%)**. Your final paper for
this class, again, may be on any reading we have done for the class. It may
also, as before, be based on one of the short response papers you have done
during the term. In the paper, you should expect to incorporate both close
readings of texts and results of independent research you have done on your
topic. As with the short paper, you will turn in a rough draft and a revised
version, both of which will count equally for purposes of evaluation.

6) **A final paper (10-12 pgs.) (25%)**. See description under (5).

During the course of the semester, I will occasionally ask you to complete
other assignments, such as meeting with me in office hours to talk about the
class and about your papers.

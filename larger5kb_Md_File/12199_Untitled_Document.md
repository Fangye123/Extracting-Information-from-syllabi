  * critique goals and methods of several generations of citizens, lawyers, judges, and politicians who have re-interpreted the Constitution;
  * assess the ways that society, culture, ideology, & politics have affected the U.S. political system;
  * think about and discuss the ways that constitutionalism directly and indirectly affects our lives.

> "Politics and Values" is designed to examine some of the major themes in

justice, equality and the political construction of the human condition. The

to a universal or global context.

> * Alix Howard, the teaching assistant for the course, will assign papers for
you to complete over the course of the semester. These papers, together with
the student's participation in the Tuesday afternoon's discussions, will
comprise 25% of the final grade. Consult with him about the due dates for
these papers.

>

>  
>

> The dates for papers and exams are listed in the reading assignments. No
late papers will be accepted.

>

>  
>

> Requirements:

>

> Role will be taken at every class. The student is allowed only two
undocumented absences. Otherwise, apart from a documented illness or family
emergency, two points will be subtracted form the student's overall grade for
every additional absence.

>

> Class participation is crucial in a course of this nature. The student is
expected to come to all classes having read the assigned material and prepared
to discuss it with others. Students are also expected to ask pertinent
questions of all guest-speakers and to generally offer comments (consistent
with the student's own comfort level) regarding all the activities in the
course.

>

> Finally, given the occasionally controversial nature of the subject matter,
the student must pledge of to be tolerant of other's opinions and treat
his/her fellow classmates with civility at all times.I reserve the right to
alter the student's final grade if he/she has either failed to completely
participate in the sessions or has made a significant contribution to them.

>

>  
>

> Final Paper:

>

> In a departure from last semester's journals, this semester the student is
asked to write a 12-15 page term paper. In it, the student is asked to
construct an ideal or utopian society. While it is up to the student how to
approach this topic, he/she is asked to apply as fully as possible the issues
and concerns that we have covered during the two semesters when they are
pertinent to the chosen subject. We will discuss this in more detail as the
semester progresses.

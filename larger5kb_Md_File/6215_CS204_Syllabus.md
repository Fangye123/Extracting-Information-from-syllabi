Purpose and objectives:  
This course is designed to introduce students to computer science and computer
programming techniques using the programming language C++. The emphasis will
be on methods and techniques used in basic algorithm development., and
emphasize the procedural paradigm of for program development. This is a
programming intensive course.

More specifically student should be able to:  
1\. Identify, describe and distinguish between computer hardware and software.  
2\. Describe the role of language software with respect to the above.  
3\. Utilize appropriate control structures.  
4\. Implement good program design techniques  
5\. Write parameterized functions.  
6\. Make appropriate use of local and global variables.  
7\. Implement proper structs and single and multidimensional arrays.  
8\. Use simple class structures.

**Some Policies**  
**Class Assignments:**  
Each Assignment, program or quiz will receive a point value, and the points
will accumulate as these are turned in.   All  assignments will be due at the
beginning of class on the due date.  If your work is incomplete, turn in
whatever you have finished for **partial credit** , because **assignments will
NOT be accepted after the due date**.   All assignments must be pledged, and
the pledge indicates that the work is your own and has been done without
consulting anyone else.  You may consult computer center personnel about
hardware operation, and you may of course consult the instructor and text
books and other materials. It is also suggested you ask lots of questions in
class.  Specific criteria for programs, and their documentation will be given
as assignments are made.

**Programming Assignments:**  
Programs will be placed in your subdirectory on the **Unix system (Delphi)** ,
and a **paper copy** of the source code must be **turned** in to the
instructor.   Some assignments will be group work, other will be individual
assignments. You will be told which is which. I will give a more explicit
instructions about assignments as time goes by.

**Honor Code**  
"Discussion" of homework with the instructor is encouraged, even discussion
with the instructor when several students are present.   Otherwise discussion
of assignments outside of your group is cheating or on individual assignment
with anyone other than the instructor is cheating.  The work you turn in must
be your own.  Do not put anything on an assignment that you do not completely
understand, regardless of the source.  If you (or your group) use an outside
source, another text, or program from another text, failure to cite the
reference is cheating (plagerism).  Copying someone elses work (group or
individual) or having someone do the work for you is cheating.  Helping
someone else to cheat is an honor violation.  Do not lead others to
**temptation** to cheat; remove all your work files from hard drives in the
lab, and do not leave hard copies of programs in the lab trash cans.

**Grades**  
Letter grades will be assigned on the standard percent basis. That is:  
A, 100 - 90; B, 89 -80; C, 79 - 70; D, 69 -60; F below 60 percent.

**Class Attendance Policy:**  
Class attendance is expected and strongly recommended, but not required.   The
student is responsible for any work missed.  In the case of absence for a
test, the instructor will not give a makeup test unless the absence meets the
criteria for an excused absence as stated in the College Catalog. The excuse
should include a note from a physician or faculty sponsor of a college
sponsored activity.

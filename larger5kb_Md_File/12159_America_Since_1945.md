  | **_Course Requirements:_** _ _ Students are expected to attend lectures
twice a week; to read the weekly assignments; and to meet in sections once a
week to discuss both the lectures and the readings.   Each student will also
be asked to write two papers (see assignments below); to take a midterm
examination in class on March 4; and to take a final examination in exam
period.  Papers, exams, and section participation will each constitute one-
third of the grade for the course.  Papers will be evaluated for both content
(evidence and argument) and style of presentation.  Writing style is less
important, of course, on exams, but both argument and evidence are critical
there as well.  Section participation will be measured by a combination of
attendance, preparation, and participation.  Students who do not attend
sections will, needless to say, have no opportunity to be evaluated for the
other elements.

This syllabus, along with other information about this course, will be
available on the History W3651 home page, which you can access through the
history department website on the Columbia web (www.columbia.edu/cu/history).

noted in the schedule beginning on page 2.  All readings are available for

**_PAPER   ASSIGNMENTS_**

**_First Paper Assignment_** (due the week of February 2):

You have been asked to read several chapters from Elaine Tyler May's Homeward
Bound, which makes a number of observations about the character of American
culture and the American family in the age of the Cold War.  After reading
May's book, we ask you to identify a document that you think illustrates some
theme in Cold War culture, and to write a short paper (no more than 5 double-
spaced pages) about what you think we can learn from it.  The document can be
a book, a magazine article, an advertisement, a work of art or illustration, a
film, a piece of music, a television program, or virtually anything else as
long as it predates 1955 and seems to you to be a useful window into the
character of its time.   You may, if you wish, use your document to comment on
May's arguments, but you are not required to do so.  


**_Second Paper Assignment_** (due the week of April 15):

The second paper should be 8-10 double-spaced pages in length and should deal
with a topic of your choice, to be discussed with and approved by your section
instructor.  The paper can deal with any subject or period in postwar American
history (although papers dealing with issues that are very contemporary will
require particular justification), and it should be based at least in part on
primary sources.  


**_Graduate Student Requirements_**

History department and graduate students in other Arts and Sciences
departments are exempted from the papers and exams assigned to undergraduates
in this course.  Instead, you are asked to write a historiographical essay
examining the scholarly literature on an issue of significance in postwar
American history.  Papers should be no longer than 15 double-spaced pages and
are due the week of April 22.

Graduate students outside the GSAS departments (in GS, MALS, SIPA, TC, or
other programs or schools) may choose either the undergraduate or graduate
student requirements.

Course Description: HST 421 will be an exploration into the historical
relationship between human society and the Earth in Europe, Africa, Asia,
and the Americas. Themes to be explored include human ecology in history,
nature and state power, traditional versus modern land use, human culture
and environment, industrial transformation, capitalist development, conservation
and environmentalism, religion and nature, and historians and the environment.
This will be a combination lecture and discussion course.

The course has been designed for upper-division students of all majors.
Freshmen should see the instructor before remaining in the class. Students
with weak backgrounds in world history would benefit from keeping a few
survey textbooks available for consultation.

acquaint you with environmental history around the world. The professor
will announce the reading schedule each week in class.

Course Requirements
Monograph and Interpretive Book Review: Each student will
select a substantive monographic book in environmental history from a list
to be distributed later, read it, and write a 1500 - 2000 word interpretive
review (the meaning of this will be explained in detail). Papers must be
typed, double-spaced, with one-inch margins on all sides. Two copies of
each paper must be submitted as one will be placed on library reserve (without
instructor comments or grades) for other class members to read.

All papers must be properly spell-checked and proof-read. Papers with
more than three spelling or typographical errors will be returned, ungraded,
for correction. 100 points.

Exams: There will be one midterm examination and a final.
Both will be of the take-home essay type. Because of the nature of the
subject, the final examination will be comprehensive.

Attendance: Since class meetings will often deal with
material not found in assigned materials, and since discussion sessions
will be frequent, attendance is mandatory. Students are expected to arrive
prepared for discussions or other class activity as scheduled. Participation
will count for 10% of your total grade.

Grading: Final letter grades will be based on a percentage
of the total points possible. No curve will be used, but overall class
scores will be considered in determining final letter grades.

Please keep in mind the meaning of those letters as indicated in the
Class Schedule :


A = Exceptional accomplishment

B = Superior

C = Average

D = Inferior

F = Failed

Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading. Please understand
that high grades are earned, not given. You build your grade from the bottom
up rather than being "marked-off" from the top down. Your "usual" grades
in other courses have no bearing on your grades in this course. No grade
better than a "B" will be given for work that does not represent exceptional
scholarly accomplishment.

Office Hours: Office hour times are listed at the top
of the first page of this syllabus. If you cannot meet during posted times,
see the instructor for an appointment. Please note: In order to avoid interrupting
students who come during office hours, the instructor will not receive
phone calls during those times. You can leave a message at any time by
phoning and waiting for the voice mail system to activate. Be sure to leave
your phone number so your call may be returned if necessary.

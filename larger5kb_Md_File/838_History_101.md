Office: Kresge 117  
Phone: 437-7341, ext. 2488  
Office Hours: 2:00-3:00, 8:00-9:00 p.m. M; 2:00-4:00 W; and by appointment

#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS

**Hour examinations (45%)**      There will be two hour exams, presently
scheduled for February 21 and April 12. Makeup exams will be given only in
cases of verifiable illness or family emergency. Students with exam grades of
71 (C-) or below who go over their exams with me during office hours within a
reasonable time after the exam is returned (normally two weeks) will earn an
additional five points for that exam.

**Review Exercises (20%)**  
* The seven review exercises consist primarily of objective questions: multiple choice, true-false (which usually require the correction of false statements), fill in the blank, number in chronological order, and so forth. There may also be some short answer questions based on the readings in the sourcebook. These exercises serve a number of purposes: they encourage you to review your notes and to stay caught up with reading assignments; they emphasize important points which you may not have noticed were important when you read them; they require you to think about the material and begin to put related points together, and they provide a valuable study guide for the final examination. 
* All assignments are due on the day on which they appear on the course outline. Late papers incur a ten-point penalty for each weekday late; a paper is late when it has not been turned in by 3:00 p.m. on the due date. 
* Please remember that work which is turned in for a grade must be entirely your own. Do not work with anyone else at any stage of its preparation. Collaboration on these assignments is a violation of the College's policy on academic honor, and appropriate action will be taken.
**Class participation (10%)**  
* In order to earn full credit for class participation, you must do the following:  

  1. Come to class regularly, having prepared the assignment for the day. You will be excused one absence for reasons other than verifiable illness or family emergency; each additional unexcused absence will lower your class participation grade by ten points (the equivalent of one point off your grade for the course.) If you arrive after attendance has been taken, it is your responsibility to see me after class to make sure you have been counted present. 
  2. Ask questions on matters you do not understand, particularly if you are having difficulty in the course, in class, during my office hours, or by e-mail. 
  3. Participate in an electronic discussion at least once each week using the College's e-mail network, either by initiating a topic or by responding to someone else's comment. The topics discussed must be connected in some way with the readings or class discussions. 
  4. Pay attention and take notes diligently. Please be aware that in order to succeed in this course, you must have good lecture notes. No tape recorders are permitted in class. 
  5. Attend three films scheduled outside of class hours, as indicated on the course outline below. These films count as regular class meetings, and attendance will be taken. Unless you have a competing commitment (i.e. another class, sports practice for an imminent game or meet, employment), you are expected to see the film at the time listed on the syllabus. Students who have such competing commitments must notify me in advance and must see the film, which will be placed on reserve in the library, at their earliest possible opportunity. 

* You may earn up to thirty extra credit points to be added to your class participation grade as follows:  

  1. For each substantive conference you have with me during office hours, four points. In order to earn the four points for a conference, you must come prepared with a list of questions about the lectures or readings which you would like me to clarify. 
  2. For each review session you attend in which you ask questions, two points. You must turn in questions in writing (those which arise spontaneously during the review session may be turned in at the end) in order to receive credit. Questions must relate directly to the material covered on the exam. 
  3. For each review session you attend in which you do not ask questions, one point.  

  4. For attending the showing of A Man for All Seasons, scheduled for April 23, four points. Please note that you must view this film with the class; you may not make it up in the library.

### GENERAL COMMENTS

1) The study of history at the introductory level involves not only an
exposure to people, places, and events which are part of our heritage, but
also an attempt to place all these things in the larger context of their
relationship to each other. Of the two, the quest for the big picture is the
more important. The goal of this course is not to provide you with a fixed
quantity of "true information"; no one expects you to remember trivia unless
it helps fix a major idea in your mind. The main use of facts in history is to
support an argument or an interpretation. It is not enough to be able to
repeat the facts without being able to tell why they are important.  
2) In studying pre-modern European history, you will find that many ideas you
take for granted must be set to one side. The aim of historical study is to
allow you to understand people in their own context, and not to judge them
from your modern perspective. For example, you will find that loyalty to
family or tribe, religious ideas or institutions, and the power structures of
the local community was almost always more powerful than any concept of
loyalty to any larger entity. In addition, you will find that new research has
called into question or rendered obsolete some of the things you may have
learned before you came to college. This discovery can be profoundly
frustrating or unsettling, but refusal to acknowledge it is intellectually
dishonest.  

### BASIC STUDY TIPS

1) You must look for major concepts, ideas, and conclusions, both in your
reading and in the lectures. In both lectures and readings, you will notice
certain signals which should indicate to you that you should take particular
notice of what follows; e.g. "the most important result...," "the principal
cause...," "the three main features...." These suggest that the available
evidence has been digested, arranged in coherent order, and summarized in a
useful way.  
2) You may find it helpful to make marginal notes in the textbook to indicate
the main point of a section or paragraph.  
3) Do not underestimate the importance of a dictionary. You will almost
certainly come across words with which you are not familiar in the textbook,
and perhaps in the lectures as well. Look them up. Do not assume that you
understand a passage until you understand every word.  
4) The editors of the sourcebook have provided review questions in each
section. Use them to make certain that you understand the importance of each
reading.

### TAKING NOTES

1) Take down as much of the lecture or discussion as possible. Do not confine
yourself to brief words or phrases unless you are absolutely sure you know
what they mean and how they fit into the rest of the material. Although some
of what we do in class involves material which is in the textbook, it is
nonetheless important to have good notes both because they will help you
distinguish the important points in the reading and because I will make
additional points which are not in the reading. Please keep in mind that I use
facts as evidence for arguments; if you only write down factual information,
you will completely miss the point of the lectures.  
2) Terms I write on the board are important. They are, however, not the only
terms which are important; I write them on the board primarily because I think
someone may have trouble spelling them.  
3) Listen for verbal clues to really significant points.  
4) Go over your notes as soon as possible after the lecture. Better yet,
recopy them, expanding abbreviations and isolated phrases. You may want to
type them-that makes them much easier to study, and classmates who have to
miss class will love you.  
5) On the occasions when I distribute printed copies of the lecture notes,
outline them or add headings and subheadings if you find that you can learn
them better that way.  
6) If you discover that there is something in your notes you don't understand,
come see me and ask. Do not wait until the last minute. Your willingness to
ask questions proves to me that you're trying.

### EXAMS

The hourly exams for this course almost always include a section of
identifications and another of short essays. You may be asked to pick four out
of six terms and two out of three essays, or one of the essays may be replaced
by a section of short-answer questions. The final exam is entirely objective.

_Before an essay exam_

1) Try to predict the questions which will be on the exam. Keep in mind that I
have to choose questions which will test your understanding of all the
material covered, but which you can reasonably be expected to answer in the
available time. That means that I am not going to waste time on trivia. It
goes without saying that you should not rely on your ability to second-guess
the questions to such an extent that you ignore other possibilities.  
2) If you find verbal information more difficult to remember or assimilate
than visually oriented material, draw diagrams which relate concepts to each
other. Construct mental pictures based on textbook illustrations.  
3) Classify the material relating to each different people, time, or place
into certain standard categories: government, religion, society, economy,
intellectual life, geography, etc. Try to explain why a particular people,
time, or place has a particular feature. How do changes in one category
influence the other categories? Compare the features of this particular
people, time, or place with those of others you have studied? Always try to
account for differences and similarities.  
4) Dates:  

    
* With a few major exceptions (476 for the official fall of Rome, 800 for the crowning of Charlemagne, 1066 for the Norman Conquest of England, 1348 for the Black Death, etc.), exact dates are not nearly as important as relative dates. It is crucially important in terms of causation that the cause precede the effect! Generally speaking, it is sufficient if you can date something in the right half-century or so, e.g. early 12th/c, late 14th/c. If you are not sure of the date, it is better to leave it out of your answer.
    
* Constructing a time-line will enable you to place events and trends in their proper relation to each other.  

5) Always remember, in case of disagreements between the lectures and the book
on matters of interpretation, that the author of the textbook is not grading
the exam! That does not mean that you must always agree with the
interpretation given in class. It does mean that you must acknowledge that
interpretation and explain why you think the textbook version is more
convincing.

_During the exam

_ 1) One section of an exam almost invariably requires you to identify and
give the significance of a number of terms. These terms will include people,
places, events, objects, and on rare occasions dates. You will be allotted
about five minutes for each term. That means, first, that you must be able to
recognize the term without too much time for thought, and secondly, that you
must not attempt to write down everything there is to know about it. Confine
yourself to following the directions, i.e. identify the term, then mention the
principal facts which make that particular term significant information rather
than trivia.  
2) Essay questions usually require you to pull together material from several
different lectures or readings. They are intended to make you think. In
dealing with such questions:  

* Read the question carefully, several times if need be. Think about all elements of the question. If it includes an introductory quotation, keep in mind that it is there for a reason; do not skip directly to the question. 
* Think about each element of the question. What is it asking? Don't answer a question which wasn't asked. 
* What lectures, discussions, and readings relate to the question? Think about them. Somewhere you should spot the central point which ties the various elements of the question together.

_Exam grading_

1) Terms for identification are graded as items consisting of a certain number
of component parts. If you identify a term but fail to give its significance,
you will receive, at most, four or five points out of ten, regardless of how
descriptive your identification is. If there are three significant points to
be made, and you make only one of them, again, you will receive half credit at
most. Full credit means that you have identified the term and mentioned all
the significant issues we covered in reference to it.  
2) Essays are graded on a letter-grade scale which is then converted to point
values as follows:  

* **A (27-30 points):** The A answer directly, succinctly, and completely addresses every component of the question. It is well-organized, without wandering off on irrelevant tangents. Any errors are trivial. It is clear that the writer possesses a firm understanding of the issues involved. 
* **B (24-26 points):** The B answer shows a good understanding of most of the issues involved in the question, but it is unclear or confused on a major point, or omits a major issue entirely. 
* **C (21-23 points):** The C answer shows a basic but obviously incomplete understanding of the issues involved in the question. It may omit a major component of the question or reduce a complex issue to one or two points. The C answer often includes a great deal of trivial information that is completely irrelevant to the question that was asked. 
* **D (18-20 points):** The D answer demonstrates a very unclear understanding of the issues involved in the question, although it does include a few relevant points. It often consists of unsubstantiated generalizations. 
* **F (0-17 points):** The F answer shows no understanding of the issues involved in the question, or almost none, or it answers a question other than the one which was asked.

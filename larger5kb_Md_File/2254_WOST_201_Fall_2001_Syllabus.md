What do we mean by the category "woman"? Are there essential/innate
characteristics that define all women? What of our many differences? How do we
incorporate other social categories such as race, ethnicity, class, sexuality,
and nationality? This course will explore theories about women and gender
through interdisciplinary analyses, as well as disciplinary lenses such as
biology, history, sociology, anthropology, philosophy, and literary studies.
What is gained in developing identities such as Woman, African-American,
Latino, Arab-American, Native American, Working-class, Asian, Gay, Bisexual,
Queer? What are the consequences of developing politics through the use of
identity? How do we incorporate the complexities of multiple identities? This
course will explore some of the important theorists, thinkers, writers and
activists who have grappled with the inextricable interconnections of gender,
race, class, sexuality, ethnicity and nationality. We will grapple with how to
conceptualize the category "woman" to reflect all the similarities as well as
the many substantive differences.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:  

  1. _Social Positionality Paper:_** This 2-3 page paper will not be graded but IS required. Despite the lack of the grade, I consider this assignment to be vitally important and expect your serious consideration and effort. You will be graded down if you do not complete the assignment. _**(Due 10/9)_**  

  2. _**One Descriptive Paper:_** One paper summarizing your understanding of one of the theoretical articles we will read. The paper will count for _10%_ of your grade. _**(Due 9/25)_**  

  3. _**Two Analytic Papers:_** Two papers of 5 pages each on topics to be announced. These papers will require you to do an analytic work of the material for this course, rather than doing library research on topics not addressed in class. Each paper will count for _15%_ of your grade. For the first analytic paper due 10/30, you will exchange papers with a fellow student, comment and grade each other's paper (comments due 11/6 and the comments count for 10% of your grade). _**(Due 10/30, 11/6 and 11/20)_**  

  4. _**Group Project:_** Students will work in groups in doing a research project. Topics will be discussed in class. Oral presentation on the project will count for 15% of your grade and the final written report for _15%_ of your grade. _**(Presentations 12/4 or 12/6; Due 12/13)_**  

  5. _**Class Participation:_** The issues we will be discussing this semester have both academic and personal implications. In order to grapple with this material it is vital to read the assignments carefully and on time, come to class with questions, opinions, and analyses (agreements and disagreements) -- in other words to be prepared to participate in an intellectual debate. Class participation (quality not quantity!) counts for _10%_ of your grade.  

  6. _**Occasional In- Class Writing:_** Several times during the semester I will include in-class writing assignments. Two of your best grades will count for _10%_ of your grade (5% each).

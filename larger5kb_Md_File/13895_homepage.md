**_Description:_**

Cryptography is the practice of encrypting or encoding messages and
information in order to hide their contents from unintended eavesdroppers. Its
beginnings can be traced back to ancient civilizations. Efforts to break the
codes in order to uncover the hidden messages have developed into the science
of cryptanalysis. Together, cryptography and cryptanalysis make up what is
called cryptology.  Throughout history cryptology has played an important
although necessarily hidden role in politics, diplomacy, and war.  It has
acquired renewed significance in the last several years due to its crucial
role in the efforts to preserve the privacy of messages and transactions sent
through the Internet.

This seminar will provide an overview of cryptology and its various aspects.
We will examine several classic ciphers, as well as more modern cryptographic
methods, such as the data encryption standard (DES) and public key
cryptography. Mathematical concepts will be developed as needed. Computer work
will include the use of spreadsheets to experiment with some simple
enciphering  and statistical analysis of encoded text.  The course will also
examine some of the history of cryptology, its social and political
implications, and recent developments affecting computer security.

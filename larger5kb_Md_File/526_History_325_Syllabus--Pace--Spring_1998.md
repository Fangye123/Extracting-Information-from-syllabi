### Attendance Policy:

Attendance in the class is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. Because much of the
information in this class comes from lectures, absences will place the student
significantly behind, therefore, attendance records will be kept. If a
student's absences, both excused and unexcused, equal 25% of the class days,
the student will automatically fail the course (no questions asked).  
  
Make-up exams will be administered only when students can show a valid reason
for their absence (this means verification from either the health center or
from the dean). All students must make an appointment to take the make-up
within one week of the original exam. If such arrangements are not made, the
student automatically fails the course.

### Outside Essay:

All students must write one essay outside of tests in the course of the
semester. This essay should contain about 1,000-1,500 words (about 4 to 6
pages) and is due Monday, April 6, 1998, at the beginning of class. All papers
should be written on a word preocessor. If the paper is not turned in at the
beginning of class it will be considered a day late. Five points will b
deducted from the essay grade for every day it is late. The essay will cover
the following:  
  
Write an essay about four of the women in _The Human Tradition in Modern Latin
America_ book. Discuss how these women overcame and took advantage of the
obstacles and opportunities in their particular circumstances. Essays should
include some discussion of the Latin American country of each woman.

### Additional Reading:

Students should scan the bibliography at the end of the Keen book for titles
of interest. After finding the names of two books and confirming that these
books are in the library, students should type a brief paragraph for each
book, discussing why he or she is interested in the topic. Each paragrah
should begin with the full bibliographic information of the book covered.
These descriptions are due on Monday, January 26, 1998. The instructor will
either approve the books or suggest other titles on similar topics. Students
will then read the two books before the end of the semester.  
  
On the class period before finals, students will give the instructor their
bluebooks with the the title of the two books they read written on the inside
cover. When the students come to take the final they will find one of the two
titles circled. The students will be required to write a full, critical
analysis of the title circled for a significant portion of the final exam.
This analysis will have two parts:  
  
**PART A:** A summary of what the book was about, either in general or under
chapter headings. Be sure to provide sufficient detail that will help
illustrate any criticisms or points you want to make in the second part of
your assignment. On the other hand, do not provide so much detail that you
cannot explain the overall story of the book in the space allotted. This
summary should be about 2-3 pages.  
  
**PART B** : A critical commentary on the book of about 2-3 pages. This
commentary should include the following information:  
1\. What was the purpose of the book as detailed by the author or from a
general reading?  
2\. How well does the author achieve this purpose? That is, is it a convincing
argument or treatment? Why or why not?  
3\. What are the author's interpretations?  
4\. Does the author exhibit a bias or slant in his or her treatment of the
material?  
5\. How does the author agree or disagree with classroom lectures, your
assigned readings in the course, or other things that you have read?  
6\. What types of sources did the author use? Are they primary or secondary?
Were these sources used effectively?  
7\. You should conclude with a discussion of whether or not you would
recommend this book as a solid treatment of the subject matter.

### Honor Code:

Because trust and integrity are integral parts of an academic environment and
decent society, all work in the course will be your own. Write out and sign
the honor pledge when you hand in papers. (I have neither given nor received
any help on this test nor am I aware of any infraction of the Honor Code.)

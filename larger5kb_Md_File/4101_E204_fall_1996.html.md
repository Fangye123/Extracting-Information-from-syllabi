Studies in Nineteenth-Century British Literature: The County and the City  
  
"On the country has gathered the idea of a natural way of life: of peace,
innocence, and simple virtue. On the city has gathered the idea of an achieved
centre of learning, communication, light. Powerful hostile associations have
also developed: on the city as a place of noise, worldliness and ambition; on
the country as a place of backwardness, ignorance, limitation. A contrast
between country and city, as fundamental ways of life, reaches back into
classical times. Yet the real history, throughout, has been astonishingly
varied."  
Raymond Williams, The Country and the City , (1973)

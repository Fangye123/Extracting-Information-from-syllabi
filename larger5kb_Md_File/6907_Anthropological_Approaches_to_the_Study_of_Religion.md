### The Course

ANTHROPOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF RELIGION looks at human religiosity
in two ways. First it approaches religion as a collection of symbols which
organize beliefs and practices. Focusing on symbols offers access to the way
religious actions are understood by actors. Second it conceives of religion as
a historical phenomenon, changing in ways consistent with political, economic,
and social circumstances.

These two approaches have obvious virtues. It is plausible to study economic
behavior--the growth of the economy, the rise and fall of firms, the relation
of credit to economic prosperity--without paying much attention to individual
attitudes. It is hard to imagine doing so with religious behavior because its
core seems to be a distinctive mental state and what we want to understand in
studying other religions is how those religious practices shape attitudes,
experiences, and the very way human beings experience the world. Religion is
not just something that people do. It is not just a set of beliefs and
practices. It provides "another world to live in," a world constituted and
made real, especially by what goes on in ritual occasions, by the use of
symbols. As a consequence, I will spend considerable amounts of time this year
talking about how rituals create that "world."

Studying religion in a historical or evolutionary way, by contrast, allows
both the possibility of comparison and a context to think about the way
religious life interacts with other aspects of social existence. Applying a
historical perspective to the study of religion faces one great difficulty.
Because the convenient terms--"primitive" and "modern"--are heavily loaded
with everyday meaning, it is easy to assume that modern religions are somehow
better than primitive ones--an interesting point but (even if we are willing
to make clear what we mean by "better" and then justify those assertions)
highly arguable--and that the religions of technologically-simple societies
evolve in a straightforward way towards more sophisticated forms--which is
seldom the case. What is required then is thinking about various religions as
orienting people to the world in ways that are systematically related to
historical changes, while respecting the virtue of all religions.

### Reserve Readings

  1. Bellah, Beyond Belief   

  2. Geertz The Interpretation of Cultures
  3. Lessa and Vogt, eds., Reader in Comparative Religion

This book has appeared in several editions; some of the articles continue
throughout, but there are additions and deletions. If you cannot find the
article you need, check the syllabus again or ask the librarian at the Reserve
desk for the other editions. I've specified the fourth edition for all of the
readings but one or two, which is the Bellah piece that also appears in
Bellah's book Beyond Belief. Many of the readings cited in the fourth edition
also appear in other editions, so if you need a reading and all of the fourth
editions are checked out, try the others.

## Course Requirements

    During the early part of the semester there are three short papers (3-4 pages) required for the course. Each is worth 20% of the final mark. The final examination is worth 30%. The remaining 10% depends on class attendance and participation.     

I value what students have to say, sometimes to the extent of letting people
go off on tangents. Where I can I will set aside the first part of every
Friday class for students to bring up issues in the readings that especially
interest them.  

Hanging 10% of final grades on class participation is a form of coercion, but
I believe learning to talk in an academic setting is as important as learning
to think analytically or use a computer. Students usually assume that they are
being judged on the content of their comments. I judge students merely on
whether they say something. There are no dumb comments--there are only
students who do not contribute to class and students who do. In my experience,
the only mistake a student makes in class is imagining her or his comments are
worth airing on every topic. If you are a verbal person, let other people have
a chance at it. If you are not verbal, recognize that your ideas are often
more incisive than those of people who talk regularly. Make an effort to make
your ideas known, whether it is the first day of class or late November.  

    **Final Exam - Friday, 17 December, 1:15 pm**

    _**All students are responsible for reading and understanding the Bates College statements on academic honesty, crediting of sources, and plagiarism.**_

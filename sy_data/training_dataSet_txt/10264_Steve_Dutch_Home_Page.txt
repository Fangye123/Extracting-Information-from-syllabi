University Survival Guide

Who are these people and why are they messing with my mind?
    Ever wonder why you have to take some of the courses you do? This might help. 
Taking Multiple Choice Tests 
What is an A? What exactly do professors want in an essay
    exam or term paper? Includes samples of A, B, C, and D-F writing with explanations why. 
References for College Papers Can I reference my class notes?
    (No) What about the Internet? (Maybe) Get The Rules here. 
Top Ten No Sympathy Lines Warning! Blunt Language!.

My Web Philosophy

It's not so much surfing as Dumpster-Diving. I used to wonder how bad it could be
    if we just let anybody publish their ideas. Now I know. Real bad. 
I like computers. I am awed by them. I am delighted by what they can do. But I
    don't trust them! Electronic storage is ephemeral and fragile. Not all of that is bad.
    The useful half-life of most information is a few years. But I do not assume I will always
    have a Web to access or even floppy disks to read. If I find some useful information, I
    download it. If it's really important, I may even make a hard copy. If a national
    emergency breaks down our telecommunications, the Web is history. If a rogue nation or
    terrorist sets off a nuclear weapon 100 miles above the U.S., most P.C.'s are history
    (check out something called EMP). I still have a slide rule. 
graphics? GRAPHICS? WE DON' NEED NO STINKING GRAPHICS! Too many Web pages are
    cluttered with useless graphics (eye candy). See this campus's web page for
    a case in point. See how long it takes you to figure out what classes we
    offer, where, and when. In case you're not aware of it, data storage
    and transmission capacity are finite resources. Given the spatial nature of geology and
    some of my avocational interests like geometry and polyhedra, I have a lot of
    graphics, but I try to keep them to the necessary minimum in number and simplicity.
    Drawings are mostly 16-color, with no sound or unnecessary animation, to keep download time short and keep
    material accessible to users with low-end systems. Photos are standard JPEG format, 24-bit
    color. 
Chunky, not creamy. I figure if you're looking for information you
    want to get it, so my pages tend to be on the long side, rather than broken
    into short segments connected by links. It may take longer to download the
    page, but once you do, everything is there. 
Links. I know where my own stuff is. I have enough to do keeping track of my own
    pages without worrying if somebody else paid his Compuserve bill. I have had enough
    experiences chasing from one site to another, only to reach a dead end or have a crash, to
    conclude that links to remote sites are often useless. If I use them, they will go as
    directly as possible to the item of interest. Unless it's a stable site, like a government
    agency, I won't link to it. (Even some agency sites have shut down, and sites are being
    reorganized all the time.) In most cases, if I am aware of sites of interest, I will
    mention them so you can look them up with a search engine.

    let me know if you have any problems with my pages or links, or any constructive
    suggestions.

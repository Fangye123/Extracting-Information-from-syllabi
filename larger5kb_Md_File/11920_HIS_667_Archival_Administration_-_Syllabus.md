Attendance Policy

Regular class attendance is expected of all students. University attendance
policy will be followed.  For every two unexcused absences the final grade
will be reduced by one letter grade, (i.e. from A to B.) Absences will be
excused for the following reasons: participation in a university-sanctioned
activity or program, death in the family or other family emergency, serious
illness with a doctor's note, jury duty, military obligation, or weather
emergency making travel dangerous. Students are also expected to attend the
entire class. Arriving late or leaving early will count as an unexcused
absence, except in highly unusual circumstances. Students are responsible for
all material presented in classes they miss or changes in the course schedule
that are announced in class whether their absence is excused or unexcused. If
you miss class get notes from someone and see me as soon as possible if you
have any questions. **Students who require special arrangements for exams or
in-class presentations must make such arrangements themselves at least one
week prior to the exam or presentation.** Students with a valid excuse for
missing an exam or an in-class presentation are responsible for informing the
instructor as soon as possible, but no later than the day following the exam
or presentation.  

* * *

Academic Honesty

It is assumed and expected that all students will present only their own work
on exams and the written assignment. Any student caught cheating will fail the
course.

> Course Objectives and Requirements

>

> Education 316A will enable you to teach content reading to secondary
students by exposing you to the research and practice in the field. As writing
is a process, so is reading a process. As the writing process can be taught,
so can the reading process be taught. This course will explore the research
and its practical applications. It will also address local and state standards
that apply to reading in all disciplines.

>

> In addition, since writing in the content areas is not taught in one
specific course at UCLA, we will address how to teach writing in the various
disciplines.

>

> _Readings:_ Readings will be given to you each week. The readings should be
completed by the day they are assigned as we will be trying out various
strategies during class You will also practice the strategies using one of the
readings from Ed. 406 A  & B.

>

> _Informal Writing._ You will be actively engaged with class material by
keeping a journal and through class discussion and group interaction. Once you
are teaching, no matter what the subject, you will see the value of keeping in
touch with your students through journal writing. As you apply the various
reading strategies that we have explored, you can write in your journal about
your successes or problems. We will try to respond to each of you in writing
every week; however, some of the issues brought forth in the journals may
become a part of the class discussion for the next session.

>

>  
>

> **_Formal Writing_**

>

> 1\. As part of your ethnographic case study for Ed 406 A & B, you will also
be gathering information about the reading and writing abilities of one of
your students. We will give you a list of guiding questions to facilitate this
activity as well as a diagnostic test which will prove useful.

>

> 2\. You will create a subject matter lesson aligned with requirements for Ed
406 in which you incorporate reading/ writing strategies you have learned in
this class. Your final project should include lesson plan, student work, and
reflection. More details coming later.

>

>  
>

> _Attendance and Participation:_ This is a workshop, so it is important for
you to attend each class, be on time, and be prepared to contribute to the
group work. Since most of what we do will be "hands on," it will be difficult
to transfer the concept to your students unless you have tried it yourself. If
you must be absent for any reason, have someone in the class pick up your
materials or drop a note in our boxes in 1320 Moore Hall.

>

> Dear Class of 316A,

>

> It's Thursday afternoon and I'm sitting in my office, looking at my
cluttered desk, and wondering if I will ever get everything filed. Of course,
none of you can relate to that! My mind occasionally wanders to plans for a
reception for my son who got married in Hawaii over the holidays and all the
relatives who are coming for the weekend to help us celebrate. But enough of
that. Let's get down to business.

>

> When I wrote letters like this to my high school and middle school classes,
sometimes I would say things that I forgot to say or didn't have time to say
during class. Sometimes I wrote to reinforce what I said because maybe it
didn't sink in.

>

> Remember last week when we did the mini-lesson on underlining book titles
and I asked you to look back in your journals to see whether you did or not?
And you looked. But did you underline them; did you fix them? I found some
journals where this didn't happen. This was a teaching moment. We also talked
about spelling. One of the words I find misspelled often in your journals is
writing. Do you know the rule? There is one. See if you can figure it out.
I'll give you some pairs. Pronounce them out loud and see if that doesn't give
you a clue. Hidden and hiding. Wrapped and raped. Filling and filing. Got it
yet? We'll talk later.

>

> When you are talking about reading to your classes, don't forget a pre-
reading strategy of surveying the text first. Look at the headings and turn
them into questions. That includes titles, headings, subheadings. Look at all
the visuals and their captions. Sometimes these relate directly to the text.
Sometimes they provide material not included in the text. Look at the boldface
words. Many texts (I know history texts do this) put key vocabulary words in
boldface. Check the questions at the end of the chapter. These can guide you
in your reading. In fact, in the history book I was using last year, the whole
chapter was summarized in a bulleted paragraph just before the questions at
the end. Big help!

>

> This is what we are going to do today. In your journal just write. Anything.
What would you like to share with me? It can be about what is going on in your
classes at your assigned school, your classes here at UCLA, or just about you.
What do you feel like sharing? During class we will talk about what happens
after students write. What are some ways that you and their peers can respond
to their writing?

>

> Your assignment for next week is to read "Using Reading to Construct
Mathematical Meaning" by Siegel et al and "Communicating Mathematics through
Literature" by Narode. Pick two approaches (strategies) that you could use in
your class. Describe the approaches and show how you would use them. Be
specific. No more than one page. Incidentally, I have been using one of the
strategies in this class. Recognize it?

>

> I guess that's it for today. So begin your journals writing. You have ten
minutes.

>

> Dear Class,

>

> I've had such a wonderful weekend and I just had to share it with you. As I
hope many of you know, there were two major conferences in this area last
weekend, CABE and CATE. I was at the CATE Conference (California Association
of Teachers of English) where I presented twice. The first time I shared the
same activities with the participants that I did with you a couple of weeks
ago&emdash;writing stories about words a la The Abecedarian Book and making a
vocabulary list from looking at Ansel Adams photographs. The second session
was on the dialogic curriculum which I hope you have heard about
here&emdash;giving students more responsibility for their own learning in the
classroom.

>

> But the reason the weekend was so great was that I received an award for
classroom excellence from this state professional organization. Now that was
great enough in itself, but what happened was even better. On Saturday in the
L.A. Times was an essay which asked the question, "Would you want your son or
daughter to become a teacher?" The comments in the essay were negative so I
fired back my thoughts on the subject by email right away. I haven't heard
from the Times yet, so I guess they weren't impressed, but I shared what I
wrote in my thank-you speech when I received my award on Sunday. In other
words, I used my three minutes as a platform to boost teaching as a career.
The audience liked it, gave me a standing O. I was shocked and pleased. I hope
the Times does print it but I'm not holding my breath. Anyway, it was a
wonderful day and I'm still on a high from it all.

>

> Speaking of the Times, I usually read Steve Harvey's columns. I think you
will get a kick out of what I found in it this week. Apparently there are
other people who can't spell.

>

> So what's happening today? In your journals describe what you would like to
do for a final project. Tell me what prompted you to want to do this, how will
doing this help you as a classroom teacher, what do you need from Rebecca or
me in order to do a good job of this project. Tell me anything else you think
I should know. I will give you some extra minutes to write today so that you
can be clear and specific.

>

> For homework read "Scan and Run: A reading comprehension strategy that
works," by George B. Salembier. Then, thinking back to Rebecca's lesson of
last week, write guiding questions for something that you are going to teach.
Include a copy of the selection if possible.

>

> By the way, I saw Amy at the conference. Was anyone else from this class
there?

>

> v v v

>

> March 11, 1999

>

> Dear Class,

>

> Thanks for putting up with me last week. I was really out of it. After
coughing for over a week and trying to finish up that RFP, I wasn't even
thinking straight. But you know all those excuses. You've used them yourself
and now you are hearing them from your students. Which is why sometimes I was
flexible with my students. I understood their problems. But on the other hand,
the time for being flexible sometimes comes to an end. More on that later.

>

> After the RFP went into the mail on Friday afternoon, I went home and did
another kind of RFP, Reading For Pleasure. And what a wonderful weekend it was
(with some coughing interspersed). I finished Poisonwood Bible by Barbara
Kingsolver which is now among the best books I have ever read. I could relate
to it on several levels&emdash;excellent writing, a connection with my two
trips to Africa (three, really), my interest in history, my fascination with
the characters. I know, I know. You don't have any time to read right now, but
when you do, read this one.

>

> What I did realize was that last week I told you to have some kind of a
draft of your final project ready to share. What I forgot at the time was that
we would have no time to share because we have a guest speaker today, Cynthia
Oei, and I want to give her all the time. I'm even going to ask you to wait
until she finishes before you write in your journals, just so we don't step on
any of her time. When you do write, respond (if you want) to anything she has
said or write whatever. This will be the last journal I will see as next week
is our last class.

>

> I do have a couple of articles for you to read and a recommendation.
"Helping LEP Students Survive in the Content-Area Classroom" is by Julie Chan
and Barbara Chips. "ESL Through Content-Area Instruction" is from the Center
for Applied Linguistics in Washington D.C. Both will be nice additions to what
you will hear today from Cynthia. The book I am recommending, Content-Based
Second Language Instruction, is by Brinton, Snow, and Wesche. I was going to
copy some of it for you but I didn't know where to stop.

>

> Now for the bottom line. I expect you to do all the homework assignments. As
I've said before, the class work you can't make up, but you can make up
assignments and as responsible people, you should. The final project is
important. It takes the place of a final exam. In some way or another it
should reflect the philosophy, ideals, content of this course. When you give
it to me, you should be proud of what you have accomplished. I will respond to
each of them and put my responses in your boxes. I will not return the papers
unless you ask for them, assuming you will have kept a copy for yourself. Any
questions? See me after class.

>

> Now, sit back and enjoy Cynthia.

>

> Journal Writing. The article I gave you last week (not recorded in syllabus)
by Jetton and Alexander was called "Instructional importance: What teachers
value and what students learn." If you read it, what did you learn? If you
didn't, what would you write under that title?

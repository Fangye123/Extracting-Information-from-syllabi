### Course Objectives:

Upon completion of the course, the student will:

  * Understand the fundamental concepts of programming, including data types, control structures, Structured Programming, procedures and array processing. 
  * Understand the Object Oriented Programming concept and be able to discuss the differences between procedural and object oriented languages.
  * Be able to take an existing Java program and add functionality to it.
  * Be able to design and write Java programs using both Procedural and Object-Oriented design principals.
  * Be able to program using important Java topics discussed in class, such as operator overloading and inheritance.

  

### Course Content:

We will cover chapters in the textbook as outlined in the Semester Schedule,
along with a few selected current topics, as time permits.

### Required Textbooks:

_Introduction to Java Programming with JBuilder 4/5/6,  
Second Edition (July 2001) _ Prentice Hall  
by: Y. Daniel Liang

### Grading Policy:

The final course grade will be computed as follows:  Homework/Programs:  | 50
%  
---|---  
Quizzes:  | 10 %  
Midterm Exam:  | 20 %  
Final Exam:  | 20 %  
  
The knowledge and skills on the tests and programming assignments are both
essential to success in a programming class. Thus, the grading policy is
intented to ensure that at least satisfactory performance is required in
**both** these categories.

### Tests:

There will be a Midterm and a Final Exam. You should bring your Student ID on
test days and be prepared to show it before taking the tests. The format of
the Midterm and Final exams will be a multiple choice with code reading and
understanding.  

### Quizzes / Attendance:

Periodic quizzes will be given, sometimes in lecture and sometimes in
recitation class. Quizzes are intended to help students gauge their progress
in the class. **No makeup quizzes will be given.** Attendance and
participation is expected, both in lecture and recitation class. Pop quizzes
may be given to gauge both progress and attendance. Quizes will short-answer
and require code writing.  

### Homework / Programs:

There will be a variety of homework assignments and programming projects. Some
will be small and easy enough to complete in one sitting. Others will be
larger programming projects. Assignment specifications will be posted on the
web page. Turn in all assignments on time. Late assignments will be deducted a
letter grade per day, for up to 2 days. **Assignments later than 2 days will
not be accepted.**

Unless otherwise specified, all assignments will be turned in electronically
through the class web site. Cutoff time for all assignments is Midnight of the
posted due date. Late web submissions will be automatically blocked after the
grace period ends, **as determined by the Web Server's clock!**

### Web References:

Check the web page frequently! It will be continually updated with essential
course supplemental materials, such as notes, assignments, and examples. It
will also include other supplements, such as instructions for using the
compilers, suggested exercises, and other useful help materials. Any special
notices regarding changes to course requirements, due dates, class meetings,
etc. will be posted on the class web site. It is your responsibility to check
the web site often for updates and posted materials.  

### Miscellaneous Policies:

  * A student will be allowed to make up a missed test if he or she has a notice of illness from the Student Heath Center or family physician. Any other excuses that are not medical or emergency related will be at the discretion of the instructor, and must be approved in advance.
  * Students in the class will be given a temporary computer account from the Computer Science Department on the quake server. If you need additional help outside of class, see me during office hours. I am not on campus often, but I can always be reached through e-mail at diehl@cs.fsu.edu. Whenever you have questions about programs, be sure to always attach a copy of your code and include any compiler error messages you may be getting.
  * Please turn OFF all cellular phones, beepers, etc. in the classroom.

### Academic Honor Code:

It it your responsibility to read, understand, and conform to the Academic
Honor Code as set forth in the FSU General Bulletin and the Student Handbook.
In addition to this information, please be aware of the following:

Students are expected to do their own work on any classwork or test submitted
for a grade. It is **NOT** appropriate to work on assignments with other
students or to give or receive solutions to or from anyone before an
assignment is handed in. Examples found in the course textbook or during
lecture may be used in programs, as long as the source is cited. This is
appropriate, as some hand-in assignments may be based on program examples
found in the book. Violations of the honor code will result in severe
penalties, which can include an F in the course and proceedings before the
Honor Court.

### Accommodation of Disabilities:

Students with disabilities needing needing special accommodations should
register with and provide documentation to the Student Disability Resource
Center (SDRC), and they should bring a letter from the SDRC to the instructor
indicating what accommodations are needed. Any notice of special
accommodations should be given at least a week in advance. Students taking
exams at the SDRC office are expected to take exams at the regularly scheduled
time. Any exception to this will only be granted with a valid documented
reason and must be approved by the instructor a week before the exam.

PO 192A meets Category 1 objectives in the following ways.

(A) PO 192A provides a stimulating intellectual experience in which the
standards of student performance reflect high academic norms and values by:
(1) introducing students to competing (and on some points conflicting)
versions of democratic theory that are embedded in the American political
culture; (2) linking the various abstract norms and values that are part of
the American political culture to the concrete institutions and practices that
form the U.S. national political system; and (3) challenging students to think
critically about various institutions and practices that are part of the U.S.
national political system and about various past and proposed reforms of the
political system.

(B) PO 192A introduces students to the breadth of questions addressed by
political science and some of the characteristic ways in which they are
addressed by employing textual materials and instructor guidance that
highlight: (1) many of the major normative questions with which the discipline
deals (for example, questions such as how broadly power should be distributed
in society, what tradeoffs can or must be made between the values of liberty
and equality, and how can a democratic society guard against tyranny without
sacrificing freedom); (2) many of the major empirical questions with which the
discipline deals (for example, questions such as whether power is concentrated
or fragmented at the national level, the degree to which American elections
are open and competitive, how the American system of checks and balances among
the three branches of the federal government works, under what conditions have
civil liberties been suspended in the United States, and what roles political
parties, interest groups and the mass media play in linking American citizens
to government.); and (3) characteristic methods (e.g., logical deduction,
historical evidence, and analysis of contemporary data) by which the
discipline addresses the above types of questions.

(C) Although PO 192A is a seminar that is designed primarily to serve students
who have chosen or are seriously considering political science as their major
field of study, it enhances student understanding of other fields of study
because political science is itself an interdisciplinary field. It draws, for
instance, from philosophy, history, rhetorical studies, sociology, economics,
mathematics/statistics and law; it recombines selected aspects of these
various disciplines into a new synthetic whole. Students in PO 192A are
exposed to these various interdisciplinary connections.

(D) PO 192A fosters a sense of community through intensive interactions: (1)
among a small (not to exceed nineteen) group of students who are engaged in a
common venture in intellectual inquiry and (2) between these students and the
instructor. An emphasis on active learning encourages student participation
and involvement in discussions, projects and problem solving. Students are
expected to join in active discussion of common assigned readings and to
prepare individual or group oral reports on selected topics. The instructor
organizes and participates in discussions in addition to providing feedback
and assistance to individual students. Such shared experiences foster a sense
of academic community upon which the students will build as they progress
through their programs of study.

(E) PO 192A requires that students exercise core competency skills by: (1)
requiring frequent and regular oral participation in class discussions and one
or more oral presentations by each student, (2) requiring multiple written
assignments (e.g., essays, book reviews, research reports), and (3)
encouraging (or demanding as appropriate) students to demonstrate critical
reasoning skills and clarity of expression in both written and oral
communications. The instructor will provide periodic feedback to students on
their written work and their oral presentations.

(F) PO 192A promotes an awareness of academic support resources that are
available by: (1) incorporating at least one internet assignment which
includes instructions on how to find and use computer facilities in the
Library and the Political Science Computer Lab, (2) scheduling at least one
class session during which students are instructed on Library resources and
how to use them, (3) providing information about career opportunities that are
open to political science degree holders and resources that are available at
the Career Center, and (4) informing all students of the services available
through the Writing Center, the University Counseling Center, the Hartshorn
Health Service, Resources for Disabled Students, the University Ombudsman, and
their own academic advisor. Instructors will use their best judgement in
explicitly referring individual students to any of the above support services.
Additionally, individual instructors may choose to schedule class meetings
with representatives of one or more of the various student affairs offices on
campus.

PO 192A is a seminar version of POCC 101, which has been approved as a course
that satisfies the requirements of AUCC Categories 3C and 3F.

PO 192A meets the general Category 3 objectives by: (1)focusing and applying
core competency skills in the areas of mathematics, logical and critical
thinking, and written and oral communication; (2) serving as an introduction
to the systematic study of politics and introducing students to some of the
dominant theoretical and analytic frqmeworks employed in the discipline of
political science; and (3) illustrating the value of interdisciplinary
thinking by addressing various topics drawn from the fields of economics,
history, philosophy, psychology and sociology.

PO 192A meets the specific Category 3C objectives by: (1) educating students
to think systematically about politics by employing analytic concepts and
theoretical frameworks that are central to the discipline of political
science; (2) illustrating how selected concepts, methods and theoretical
structures employed by sister disciplines--especially economics and sociology
--are useful in studying various questions pertaining to individual and
collective behavior and how they relate to the performance of American
political institutions; and (3) training students to apply core competency
skills such as interpreting quantitative presentations of information,
inductive and deductive reasoning, critical evaluation of normative and
empirical propositions,and written and oral communication.

In addition to meeting the general Category 3 objectives as discussed above,
PO 192A meets the specific Category 3F objectives by: (1) enhancing students'
understandings of the origins and operations of the federal government and of
the various nongovernmental actors and institutions that influence and shape
politics in the U.S.; (2) illuminating the relationships among public values,
institutional structures, and individual and collective political behavior;
(3) requiring students to think seriously about the meaning and
responsibilities of citizenship; (4) exploring interactions and
interdependencies among governmental actors and institutions on the one hand
and political parties, interest groups and other institutions of mass politics
on the other; and (5) stressing logic and critical thinking in analyzing
relationships between the values that are embedded in the American political
culture and the performance of American political institutions.

Instructional Modes:  
---  
Class sessions will be discussion intensive. Interactive learning is
emphasized. Students will write research papers and make oral presentations.
Occasional video presentations and/or guest speakers may be scheduled. Timely
discussions of current political events are incorporated as appropriate to
enable students to relate abstract principles to the practical world of
politics. Some instructors may incorporate service learning projects in the
course.  
  
---  
  
* * *

Special Considerations:  
---  
PO 192A is a seminar version of PO 101, which is a large lecture course. It
should fit into any program of study that currently includes PO 101. The
department supports PO 192A and will encourage first year political science
majors to enroll in it when it is offered. It also would be an appropriate
course for students who may be considering political science as a major or
minor field of study.

The Department of Political Science plans to offer one first-year seminar
during each term of the regular academic year, rotating that offering among PO
192A, PO 192B, PO 192C, and PO 192D. Each of these courses is a seminar
version of one of the four lower division courses that are required for the
major.  
  
---  
  
* * *

Foundations:  
---  
PO 192A will be an acceptable substitute for PO 101, which currently is a
prerequisite for eleven upper-division poltical science courses.

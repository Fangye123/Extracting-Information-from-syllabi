 Modern American Social History   Modern American Social History Karen Taylor Office Hours: Spring 2002 T, R: 1 pm - 2 pm Weds.: 10 am - 4 pm or by appointment The goal of this course is to reconceptualize American History since 1877 according to a number of ways of perceiving history.   Historians seek to understand how and why Americans have acted in the past 125 years by applying different methodological and interpretive frameworks.  In this course we will be examining 5 such frameworks: 1) Gender, 2) Myth, 3) Generation (age and time), 4) Race, and 5) Power.  Required Reading: Kasson, Buffalo Bill's Wild West Edwards, Gendered Strife and Confusion Stansell, American Moderns Packer, Blood of the Liberals Johnson, Blowback  Study Groups Tentative Weekly ScheduleI.

In order to participate actively you will need to complete the readings and watch the movies before class.  How can you know how far into the readings we should be or which movies you should watch for any given class (the syllabus, after all, is divided into two-week clumps)?  Here is my generalized vision of how each two-week period will proceed: on the first day of each two-week period (Tuesday) I will give you an overview of the history of the theoretical/methodological/interpretive terrain we are about to explore, and how it has shaped our understanding of American history.  On the second day of each two-week period (Thursday) we will explore (in your groups and collectively) your insights/questions/ arguments/disagreements, which means you should have read at least half of the required reading, and watched one movie (please watch the movies in the order they are listed).  On the third day of each two-week period (Tuesday), a group of students will lead us in a discussion of how the remainder of the readings fits in with/answers questions about/complicates what we've previously discussed (which means you should have read the remaining readings).  On the fourth day of the two-week period (Thursday) we will tie our whole two weeks worth of conversations/debates together using the second movie to frame the discussion (which means you should have watched the second movie).  Discussion is worth one-fourth of your total class grade.Group  Work: As I mentioned above, each of you will be part of a group which will lead a discussion tying together our conversations/debates with the readings.  You will assign yourself to a group the first week of class by sending me an email (each person must send his or her own email) identifying which "framework" (see the opening paragraph of this syllabus for clarification) you wish to focus on for the duration of the course.  On a first-come, first-served  I will then put you in groups.  As a group you will be responsible for 4 activities:  1) Facilitating a class discussion  based on the book I have identified with your chosen framework.  I expect your facilitation to be creative (as opposed to boring) and thorough: the object of these "expercises" ("experiences" + "exercises") is  to allow you to really grapple with issues you  are interested in and get us to help you think about them, using the texts (readings and movies) as evidence for our consideration in connection with your chosen issues.  I will expect you to turn in notes on your reading/movie viewing/discussions with your group mates, a written general overview of what you desired to learn/accomplish, and a written evaluation of your own and the class's performance/reaction to your leadership.  2)  Facilitating your own learning about American history by interrogating our texts and discussions in ways that elucidate the issues you have associated with your group's focus AND teaching the rest of us how those issues can further our understanding of American history.3)Presentating your final project to the class.    As a group you are responsible for 1) tying all of your individual projects together thematically and explaining why it helps us (and how/if it limits us) to examine history from your chosen framework, and 2) presenting your individual reseach and conclusions to the class in ways that situate your work in both your group's framework and American history in general.  4)Producing a webdocument which combines your group's individual papers in a cohesive (complete with introduction, transitions, and conclusion) narrative that demonstrates to readers how looking at history from your chosen framework can help us understand American history.  The combined average of the grades you get for those four group  activities will constitute one-fourth of your total grade for the class. Midterm Exam: This will be a three-to-five page paper (specific topic TBA) in which you explore some of the issues we have discussed in class and read about, explaining both your understanding of the issues and your analysis of how they are related and how we might adjust our perspectives of them to facilitate our/cultural understandings.  Your mid-term exam will be worth one-fourth of your grade.Final Exam:  Your final project has two components, written and oral.  Your individual written portion will constitute your individual final exam grade.  The written "web-paper" should be 3 to 5 pages long and describe a specific aspect of American history between Reconstruction and the present  from the perspective of your focus (e.g. gender, myth, generation, race, power).  It should contain, in both its introduction and conclusion, analysis which links it to the other individuals' papers in your group, and explicitly addresses relationships between how you look at history from your chosen framework, and the kinds of history you are able to tell from that framework's perspective.   The final exam will be worth one-fourth of you grade for the class.If you have questions, feel like a bit of conversation, or need someplace to vent, my door is always open.*Unless otherwise indicated, I expect you to see all movies on you own at Andrews Audio Visual Center.   Last updated: August 29, 2000Â© Karen J.

The Sociology of Cyberspace (SOC 391) is a collaborative project with
coordinating professors from a variety of disciplines including sociology,
physics, philosophy, business, art, English, women's studies, and computer
science. The class was first taught by faculty and students at [Bradley
University](http://www.bradley.edu/) during the Spring 1995 semester.  The
Sociology of Cyberspace examines the contemporary revolution in human
interaction via computer. Using both postmodern and traditional media theory,
we will discuss the social construction of the virtual world and new virtual
communities with emphasis on the new culture, institutions and norms in the
experience of cyberspace. Topics include: new concepts of space, time, and
order; electronic subjectivity and anonymity; new representation of gender,
race and class; emergence of new languages of expression; and the
revolutionary impact of hypertext and multimedia technologies on human
thinking and learning.

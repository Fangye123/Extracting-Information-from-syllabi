**COURSE OVERVIEW**  

     This course surveys the history of the United States and American peoples in the nineteenth century. For the American nation, the 1800s were years of spectacular expansion; for many of its peoples, the nineteenth century brought extraordinary economic improvement, unparalleled personal independence, and unprecedented political equality. National expansion, however, rested on the enslavement of millions and the conquest of numerous nations. Moreover, struggles over slavery and its spread culminated in a Civil War that threatened to permanently disunite the states. Even after the unity of the nation was restored, deep divisions remained between regions and peoples. And even as capitalist development accelerated, the benefits of economic development eluded the majority of men and women who found themselves trapped in one or another kind of dependence and deprived of the promise of equal rights.  

     This course, then, investigates the paradoxes of progress. Its focus is on how the territorial expansion, capitalist transformation, and political democratization of the United States reshaped the character of the nation and revolutionized the lives of American peoples. Lectures, readings, and discussions will emphasize how these processes were accomplished -- and how they were contested.  

**REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**  

     The course is also intended as an introduction to the art of historical interpretation. Instead of emphasizing the passive consumption of history (the mere memorization of a set of facts and dates), this course requires students to act as historians (by reviewing sources and by constructing arguments based on evidence from them).  

     Accordingly, the three short papers (of approximately 1,000-1,250 words each) will ask you to examine various historical records and draw interpretive essays from them. The [first paper ](paper1.html) (10% of the final grade) is due at the beginning of lecture on Thursday, January 23. The [ second ](paper2.html) and [third](paper3.html) papers (each worth 20% of the final grade) are due on Tuesday, February 11 and Tuesday, March 4. There will also be a final exam which will comprise 30% of your grade for the course. The remaining 20% of your grade will be based on your performance in discussion sections.  

     To hold down costs, I have chosen to forgo a packet of xeroxed readings. Some readings will instead be available through links on the History 13B homepage. In addition, many of the documents that you will need for the preparation of your papers will also be available at [ History Links](histlink.html). Required reading are marked ![](red.gif), while those marked ![](blue.gif) are provided as material to help with your written assignments and section discussions.

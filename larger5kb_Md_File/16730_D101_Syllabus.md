History D101  
**ICON AND AXE: RUSSIA THROUGH THE AGES**

Fall 2002  
David Ransel

Office hours: 565 Ballantine Hall  
MWF 1:15-1:45 or by appointment  
(Ask me in class or phone 855-7309)

**_Required books:_**

  * [T] John M. Thompson, RUSSIA & THE SOVIET UNION
  * Charles Halperin, RUSSIA AND THE GOLDEN HORDE
  * Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, VILLAGE LIFE IN LATE TSARIST RUSSIA
  * Adam Hochschild, THE UNQUIET GHOST

**_Requirements for grade:_**

> To receive a final course grade, students must take three exams (two hourly
exams and a final) and complete a short (1,000 word) paper and a longer (2,000
word) course paper. The grade will break down as follows:

>

>   * Short paper 10%

>   * First Hourly 20%

>   * Second Hourly 20%

>   * Course paper 20%

>   * Final Exam 30%

>

**_Short paper:_**

> Submit a paper of no more than 1,000 words on the question:

>

> **How did Russians survive the Mongol conquest physically and mentally?**

>

> Paper is due Friday, September 20, by 12:20 pm (start of class). Late paper
loses one grade (for example, a B paper becomes a C paper).

>

> This short paper will be graded on content and not form. But I will edit
each paper so that you will see what improvements need to be made when you
write the course paper, which will be graded on form as well as content (see
below).

**_Course paper:_**

> Submit a paper of no more than 2,000 words on the following:

>

> **Using examples from the book by Adam Hochschild, discuss why some Russians
see a need to reveal and confront their history and why others wish to retain
the previously official communist view of the past.**

>

> Paper is due Monday, December 2 by 12:20 pm (start of class). Late paper
loses one grade.

>

> The course paper will be graded on content and form. For each error in
spelling, grammar, and punctuation after the fifth, one point will be
subtracted from the grade up to a total of 10 points (the equivalent of one
grade). In other words, a late paper with fifteen errors would lose two
grades, but this limit is rarely achieved.

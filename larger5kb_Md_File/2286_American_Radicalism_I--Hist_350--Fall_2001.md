History 350 Fall 2001 deals with movements and individuals from the American
Revolution through the late 1800s. This is the first term of a two-term
sequence. History 351, to be offered in Winter 2002, will cover topics from
about 1900 to the present. Although the two terms develop some common themes,
they are independent and can be taken separately.

This course does not assume previous course work in American history; there
are no prerequisites. However, if you find that either the class sessions or
the reading assignments refer to concepts, events, etc. which are unfamiliar
to you, please let me know, so that I can explain some of the context.

I. **Books**

The following books have been ordered at the University Bookstore. Used copies
of many of them are likely to be available at Smith Family Bookstore on East
13th between Hilyard and Alder.

**Required:**  
Tom Paine _Common Sense_ (I've ordered an inexpensive edition from Dover
Publishers but any edition will do, and it's on the web at
<http://www.bartleby.com/133/>.)  
Stephen Oates, _The Fires of Jubilee_  
Kathryn Kish Sklar, _Women's Rights Emerges within the Antislavery Movement
1830-1870_ _

Then click on the item you want to read.  It is in pdf format, which means you
need Adobe Acrobat Reader, but almost all computers will have it already.  You
may find that some pages are displayed sideways.  They will print out normally
however, and there's a button near the top of the Adobe Acrobat screen that
allows you to rotate it so that it's readable on the screen.

**Optional:  
** Daniel Pope, ed., _American Radicalism_ (A collection of articles,
documents and related materials.   About half of the book will be assigned for
Hist 350, the remainder for Hist 351 winter quarter.  I'll put at least two
copies on library reserve as an alternative to buying the book.)  NOTE: The
readings in the book are **required**.   It's listed as optional to **buy**
because of its price.

III. **Class Sessions and Reading Assignments**

Sept. 24 and 26: Introduction--Some Themes and Controversies  
    In these sessions, we will offer some definitions, note some themes in the history of American radicalism, and discuss claims that American history is marked by the **absence** of significant radical movements.  
**Read:**["Introduction: The Nature and Significance of American
Radicalism,"](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/Introduction--book.htm) in
Pope, _American Radicalism_ (pp.1-14) [Note: Because the book has not arrived
in the bookstore, I have put a version of this essay on the web.   I won't be
able to do that for other chapters from this book.]  
           [ Outline for Sept. 24](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350sept24.htm)        [Sept. 26](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350sept26.htm)               

Sept. 28, Oct. 1-5 : American Revolution or War for Independence?  
**Read:** Pope, _American Radicalism_ , Chapter One "Riot and Radicalism in
the American Revolution," (pp.15-49); ****[Declaration of
Independence](http://www.nara.gov/exhall/charters/declaration/declaration.html);

Gordon](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/realwhigs.htm);  start reading
Thomas Paine, [_Common Sense_](http://www.bartleby.com/133/) and the following
documents on [**Electronic
Reserves**](http://janus.uoregon.edu/search/rhist+350/rhist+350/1,1,1,B/frameset~3050709&F=rhist+350&1,,0)
(See above for instructions.)

        Outline for  [Sept. 28](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350sept28.htm)         [Oct. 1](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct1.htm)         [Oct. 3](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct3.htm)         [Oct. 5](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct5.htm)        

Here are [some questions for you to
consider](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350--Amerrev--Paine.htm) as you
read this material and the writings of Tom Paine.  
  
1\. Pennsylvania Convention Declaration of Rights (August 11, 1776)  
2\. New Hampshire Slaves' Petition (1779)  
3\. United Indian Nations, Speech at the Confederation Council (1786)  
4\. Workingman's Declaration of Independence (1829)  
5\. John C. Calhoun, excerpt from "Disquisition on Government" (1854)  
6\. United Nations General Assembly, Universal Declaration of Human Rights
(1948)

    In these sessions, we will ask what, if anything, was revolutionary about the American Revolution.  First, to what extent was the winning of independence also a **social** revolution for Americans that changed basic patterns of life and social relations?   Second, was the revolution an **ideological** revolution that altered fundamental ideas about the relationship between people and government?

Oct 8-10: Tom Paine--the Nation's First Radical?  
**Read:** Finish Paine, [_Common Sense_](http://www.bartleby.com/133/)  and
[Electronic Reserves](http://libweb.uoregon.edu/~acs/eresindex.html) documents
listed above.  Also read the following two excerpts from Paine's other
writings on [Electronic
Reserves](http://janus.uoregon.edu/search/rhist+350/rhist+350/1,1,1,B/frameset~3050709&F=rhist+350&1,,0)
(See above for instructions)

      [  Outline for Oct. 8](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct8.htm)             [Oct.10](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct10.htm)

    Paine's life and ideas make him in a very real sense the world's first professional international revolutionary. We will look at his life experiences and his political and intellectual contributions, examining in particular the ideology of artisan republicanism he espoused.

Oct. 12-24: Slave Revolts and the Case of Nat Turner  
**Read:** Oates, _The Fires of Jubilee_ (entire book); Pope, _American
Radicalism_ , Chapter Three, "Violence and Manliness in the Struggle Against
Slavery," (pp.88-122).

Here are [some questions for you to
consider](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350slaverevolts.htm) as you read
this material .

        [Outline for Oct. 12](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct12.htm)         [Oct. 15](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct15.htm)        [Oct. 17](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct17.htm)         [Oct. 19](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct19.htm)         [Oct. 22](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct22.htm)         [Oct. 24](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct24.htm)

We will look at the varying patterns of slave revolts in the Western
Hemisphere and then discuss the Nat Turner revolt, examining motives, tactics
and results. What is the relationship between individual psychology and group
action?  Does Turner serve well as an inspiration for movements of the
oppressed?  We'll also look at John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry, Virginia,
another attempt to attack slavery by force, paying special attention to issues
of race and gender.

**Oct. 26: MIDTERM EXAM--[Link to Grading Scale
Information](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350grading.htm)**

Oct. 29: Alexis de Tocqueville's America  
    Tocqueville was probably the most insightful of the European travelers who wrote about the United States in the nineteenth century. His ideas will form a backdrop for our discussion of social movements during the second half of the term.

        [Outline for Oct. 29](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/350oct29.htm)

Oct. 31-Nov. 12: Anti-Slavery and Women's Rights  
**Read:** Sklar, _Women's Rights Emerges..._ , Part One (pp.1-76); Part Two,
Documents 1, 3-6, 8-9, 13-17, 19-22, 22-28, 31, 33, 35-39, 42-47, 52-54.  Also
read Pope, _American Radicalism_ , Chapter Two, "Women's Networks and Women's
Protest," (pp.52-73, 78-87).  
                       

    The movement for the immediate abolition of slavery in the three decades before the Civil War was the setting for new kinds of activism among both white and African-American women.  But the anti-slavery movement itself split around 1840 over what role women should play in the movement.  In the years following the Civil War and the defeat of slavery, the movement for women's rights had to decide whether to support citizenship and voting rights for African-American men or to insist that women's rights required equal and immediate attention.  Once again, racism and conflict over women's place divided movements for social change.

Nov. 14-Nov. 30: The "Labor Question": Social Class, Labor Unions and the
Socialist Challenge  
**Read:** Salvatore, _Eugene V. Debs: Citizen and Socialist_ , Parts One and
Two (pp.1-177); Pope, _American Radicalism_ , "Chicago's Anarchists and the
Haymarket Bombing," (pp.123-169).  Note: Parts Three and Four of Salvatore's
biography of Debs are recommended but not required; _American Radicalism,_
Chapter Five, on the Populist movement and racism (pp.170-199), is also
recommended.

Throughout the nineteenth century the United States remained predominantly
rural and agricultural.  But especially after the Civil War, industrial
capitalism made its mark dramatically on the nation.  Conflict between labor
and capital became perhaps the central issue in American society.  We'll look
at aspects of this conflict, focusing on the life and times of Eugene V. Debs.
Debs's experiences as a railroad worker and labor leader and his understanding
of the heritage of the American Revolution led him by the end of the century
to represent socialism to the American people.

**Some Notes on the Course**

A. The syllabus here is rather tentative. There may be digressions and
alterations along the way.

B. Unfortunately, the length of the assigned readings varies from topic to
topic. Try to plan ahead, so that you don't find yourself too burdened when
you have other commitments. You will find the class sessions more fruitful if
you keep up with reading assignments.

C. The political and ethical implications of the topics which we study should
be of personal as well as academic concern to you. Therefore, class discussion
and your own thoughtful evaluation of the material covered are essential parts
of the course. Although the class is likely to be large and it will be
necessary to lecture most of the time, I shall provide as much opportunity as
possible for discussion. Questions and comments in class are welcome. We will
also try to provide an optional weekly discussion session to explore some of
the issues in greater detail.

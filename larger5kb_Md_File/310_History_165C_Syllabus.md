_COURSE DESCRIPTION_

_This course will explore the major political, economic, social, and
diplomatic developments in the United States since the end of the nineteenth
century. Three themes will be analyzed in depth: 1) Political Economy:   The
evolving character of the American state and its relation to the economy and
to society; 2) Pluralism:  The situations and strategies of minorities in
modern American society, including blacks, immigrants, and women; and 3)
Foreign Relations:  The determinants of United States foreign policy. The
course aims both to illuminate the historical roots of contemporary issues,
and to develop in students the habit of historical thinking as a technique of
social and political analysis._

_Important specific themes will include: the debate over the proper economic
and social role of government in the Progressive, New Deal, Great Society, and
modern eras; the mass immigration movements around the turn of the century and
since 1965; the civil rights era of the 1950s and 1960s and its consequences
for African-Americans and for American Society; the changing status of women,
especially during and after World War II; the shifting ideological bases,
institutional structures, and electoral characteristics of the political
system, especially in the New Deal and post-Vietnam eras; and U.S. foreign
policy in World Wars I and II and the Cold War._

_Lectures will ordinarily be on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays at 9:00 a.m_

_The reading list for the course includes:  
John Milton Cooper, Jr., THE WARRIOR AND THE PRIEST  
William Leuchtenburg, FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT AND THE NEW DEAL  
John Lewis Gaddis, STRATEGIES OF CONTAINMENT  
Rosalind Rosenberg, DIVIDED LIVES: AMERICAN WOMEN IN THE 20TH CENTURY  
Harvard Sitkoff, THE STRUGGLE FOR BLACK EQUALITY  
James Patterson, GRAND EXPECTATIONS_

_COURSE READER, containing selected readings that will form the bases for
weekly discussion sections_

_The course will proceed according to the following schedule. It is essential
that you read the assigned texts and the selections in the course reader
pertinent to a given week's topic BEFORE coming to discussion section. Please
note that the assigned reading in the texts is weighted heavily toward the
period since 1929. You would be well advised to begin that reading as soon as
possible, leaving time later in the quarter for work on your research paper
(see below).  _

_NOTES ON THE RESEARCH PAPER FOR HISTORY 165C_

_Library research is to the historian what laboratory experimentation is to
the biologist, or what playing an instrument is to the musician. Writing
history, in short, is a way to participate in and come to understand better
the creative dimensions of the subject, instead of merely passively consuming
it. Accordingly, one of the objects of this course is to engage students in
this form of creative scholarly activity by requiring a research project based
on primary sources._

_Primary sources comprise all sorts of documents -- newspapers, magazines,
congressional reports, personal letters, memoirs, census data, judicial
records, speeches, photographs -- the only stipulations being that the
documents must date from the period under study, and must not be filtered
through some other historian's interpretive lens. Works by other historians,
usually referred to as secondary sources, should certainly be consulted in
writing your paper, but the analysis should not principally rest upon such
works. For example, if you wished to investigate the 1925 "monkey trial" in
which John Scopes was prosecuted by the state of Tennessee for teaching the
Darwinian theory of human origins, you might examine the trial transcript,
Tennessee legislative records, newspaper accounts, or the memoirs of the two
most famous figures in the case, Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan --
but you should not base your paper principally on a secondary source such as
Ray Ginger's book, Six Days or Forever? Tennessee v. John Thomas Scopes
(1958)._

_You are free to choose whatever topic you like, from whatever period or
subject matter interests you. Some good research tools with which you might
wish to begin your investigation include _The Encyclopedia of American
History_ , _The Dictionary of American Biography_ , _The New York Times Index_
, _The Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature_ , the State Department's
_Foreign Relations of the United States_ (FRUS) series, or, for more recent
topics, some of the data bases available on the University's CD-ROM network,
including _Congressional Quarterly_. You should also make good use of the
reference librarians in Green Library, and in the Government Documents
collections located in Meyer basement. Among the keys to a successful paper
are defining the topic fairly narrowly and thus manageably, and getting
started on the research as early as possible._

Guide"](guidelines.for.writing.essays.html) _

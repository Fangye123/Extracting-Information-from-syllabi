**Grading** :  _>_ 90% = A; _>_ 80% = B; _>_ 70% = C; _>_ 60% = D;  < 60% = F.
Components of course grade: Daily quizzes= 90%; Journal = 10%.  The quizzes
will consist of multiple-choice and short-answer questions. They may cover any
lecture, discussion, assigned reading, or hand-outs prior to the quiz,
including the assigned reading for the day. They may be comprehensive
(cumulative). They may occur at any point during the scheduled class period.
The number of quizzes will be determined by the instructor; there will be
approximately one per class. Although there is not a mechanism to make up
missed quizzes, the three lowest quiz grades will be dropped prior to the
calculation of the course grade. Because there are not make-up quizzes,
extended absence due to illness or for other reasons beyond your control may
preclude successful course completion or necessitate an official withdrawal
(which is your responsibility to obtain).  The lectures may not cover all of
the assigned reading material.  Be aware that there is a lot of reading
material for this course.  If you have difficulty with reading comprehension
or lack the time to read several hours for each class then you may have
difficulty with this course. The maximum credit for a journal will be awarded
when the following criteria are met:  (a) The entries are from current mass
media sources (not academic journal articles) with current dates, (b) the
entries correspond to course material, (c) the student has written both a
brief summary of each item (including the item itself when possible) and
original comments, (d) there are approximately two or more entries per week,
(e) the materials are presented neatly and legibly, and (f) contain a variety
of types of entries (e.g., different sources and topics). The journals are due
on the next to last day of class and will be returned to you on the last day.
Cal Poly Intranet and email accounts are required.

### Frequently Asked Questions

_1\. You said we have to have Cal Poly Intranet and email accounts? How do we
get those?_

**Yes, this is a _course requirement_. You should have already been assigned
both.**

The Intranet account is required so that you can reach all areas of the web
page for your class. Information about the Intranet is available at
[www.csupomona.edu/~intranet](http://www.csupomona.edu/~intranet/). Your
Intranet account name is usually the same as your email account name. If you
don't know your Intranet password, try what I suggested the first day of
class. If that works, then go to the [Intranet services change password
page](https://www.csupomona.edu/cgi-bin/intranet/user.pl), and change your
password to something less easy to guess. If the typical first password
doesn't work, visit the ITAC support desk in the CLA building.

The Cal Poly email account is required because I may send email to it. [For
information about email accounts see Enterprise Computing's Customer Service
Center](http://www.csupomona.edu/~nes/mainmenu/userserv/accounts.html), which
is directly across from the Information booth in the CLA building. If you
typically use another email account, such as at a commercial internet service
provider, you can easily [set up your Cal Poly account to forward mail to your
other account](https://www.csupomona.edu/cgi-bin/intranet/user.pl) (you will
need an Intranet account to set up forwarding with this form). However, it is
very easy to [check your Cal Poly email account using webmail at
webmail.csupomona.edu](http://webmail.csupomona.edu).

If you do not have a computer, there are [computer labs available for your use
on campus](http://www.csupomona.edu/directories/labs/).

_2\. Is _____ going to be on the quiz?_

**Yes.** I am generally reluctant to rule out sections of lecture material in
terms of the tests, for the simple reason that it would seem kind of
ridiculous to present the material if it weren't somewhat important for some
reason. When there are sections of material in the text that are going to be
ruled out, I will tell you.

_3\. I missed a quiz. What now?_

**The lowest three quiz grades will be dropped.** Quizzes cannot be made up.
See Question 4.

_4\. Do you take roll?_

**No.** However, there is a lot of information given in class that affects
your grade. You are responsible for all lecture material, some of which is not
in the text. You must be present to take the quizzes. If you have a legitimate
emergency or illness and you feel that your grade is being unfairly affected
by this policy, please see the Registrar about withdrawing from the course. __

_5\. Will you make a review sheet for us?_

If I believe that there are important summary materials to hand out to you, I
will prepare and distribute them. However, it is not generally possible for me
to do this on demand. You should generate your own summaries of notes and
readings.

_6\. How can I narrow down what to study in this book? I can't learn all this
material!_

**Start earlier.** I will indicate in class if there are sections of the text
that aren't part of the required reading. My best suggestion to you in this
regard is to start reading early and read the material more than once. I hear
a few laughs when I say this sometimes, but I am serious. If you look at
headings, skim, and then re-read more slowly early in the course, then review
before the quizzes, you will create the framework and understanding to really
be able to remember what you read. Reading a first time early on will also
give you a big advantage in lecture comprehension and retention. Be forewarned
(again) that there is a lot of reading in this course and you should plan
ahead.

_7\. I'm going to miss class today, should I call you or bring an excuse?_

**No.** Please don't call me to tell me you are going to miss class. I
recognize there are times that students (and teachers) have to miss class.
There are really no situations in which calling me in advance or giving me a
justification will change the consequences of missing class or help your
grade. Instead, the thing to do when missing class is unavoidable is to get
the notes from another responsible student in the class. Therefore, it
behooves you to form contacts early in the quarter with people who take
careful notes and come to class regularly. They will also benefit from being
able to rely on you when they have an emergency. If want to communicate with
me about other aspects of the course (and I encourage you to do so), it is
better to use email or to visit during office hours than to try to reach me by
phone. It may be difficult for me to return phone calls, but I will respond to
all email questions.

_8\. I missed a pop quiz or a homework assignment. What now?_ Extra credit
homework or daily quizzes cannot be made up. See question 4.

_9\. Are you going to use this book again so I can resell it?_

**Possibly.** However, text books are practically out of date when they are
printed, because it takes several years to put them together. The problem is
compounded by the fact that psychology is a rapidly changing field. Therefore,
when new editions of books are available, I take advantage of them, for your
benefit, even though that means extra work for me too. Also, I try to be
responsive to student feedback when they tell me that they don't like a book--
I try to find a better one.

_10\. Why don't you use a paperback book?_

**I didn't find one available.** If I am able to find a paperback version of
the same text to order, I do.

_11\. What should I take down in my notes during class?_

**Lots.** Okay, nobody asks this question, but they should. The commonly given
advice on this is to write down the main ideas in your own words. Personally,
I write down everything I can when I am in a class, using my own set of
abbreviations, and then I re-write it immediately after class while I can
still fill in the gaps. This is pretty  exhausting, and probably most
important when you know an instructor tests heavily from lecture material that
is not redundant with the text. I do tend to test heavily from lecture
material, but it is usually material that overlaps with the text. Therefore,
you can use your own judgment about how vigorously to take notes. You have an
advantage having read the relevant part of the text in advance, because you
will probably be able to tell whether what I'm saying at any given moment is
available in the text.

_12\. Are you going to give us back our quizzes?_

**When there is written feedback on them for you.** If it is just a score, I
of course post the grades, and you may come see and discuss your particular
answer sheet, in my office. I double check the entry of the scores into the
grade spreadsheet. You should also be very sure you aren't overlooking any
questions on the back of a test page, especially the last page.

_13\. What are your rules during quiz administration?_

**Bring a scantron daily.** Although I fully expect the honor system to be in
effect, there are several guidelines I have found to reduce the ambiguity in
the testing situation. No leaving during the quiz until you turn in your test;
please use restroom beforehand. No hat brims; please don't shade eyes with
hand; eyes on own paper. Please bring photo I.D. with you to class. Please
turn back in all materials. Please put your student number on your answer
sheet.

_14.   I disagree with something you said in class.  Should I let you know?_

**Yes.**   I am interested for several reasons.  First, perhaps I accidentally
made a factual error and thus need to correct it to the group.  Second,
perhaps I said something that I didn't know was offensive to some people and
can avoid that in the future if I know about it.  Third, perhaps you need
clarification on what I meant.  Fourth, if you are wondering about something,
other people probably are as well.  You can bring something up during class,
before class, after class, or during office hours.  I'll be glad to hear about
it.

_15\. Is there a way I could download and print out the slides from the web
site so that I could put more than one slide on a piece of paper?_

**Yes.** Right click on the link to the slide set, then save the file,
noticing the directory you are putting it in. From within  Powerpoint you can
"Print Slides/Handouts."

The slides provide a _very_ rough outline and set of terms for the discussion.
Having the slides is more useful if you also have a good set of class notes.
Browsing the slides online is a perfectly adequate way to view them--you don't
need to print them out unless you wish to.

Thanks to Rich Leonard and Gray Ronk (CLASS), and the great staff of ITAC, who
have made the computer assistance possible in and for my classes, and Dean Way
and the Administration for supporting technology in our classrooms and
offices.

_16.   How do I calculate what I'll need on the final to get an A (or B,
etc.)?_

Look on your class web page: There will be an Excel spreadsheet posted with
the formula for your class. You can then fill in your obtained grades and
estimated future scores to calculate your estimated course grade.

_17\. When I click on a slide show topic, my computer asks me if I want to
open or save the file. I choose "open" but I get a browser message that says
"The page cannot be displayed." _

**If you are having this problem then you may need to save the file first,
note where you are saving it, and then open it with Powerpoint.**

_18\. Can I be a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Research Assistant (RA) in the
future?_

**Quite possibly.** Being a TA means helping to proctor exams, doing objective
grading, and an opportunity to be involved in classroom presentations. Being
an RA means joining my research team, which studies health-promoting
behaviors. In addition to the learning experiences these jobs offer, you will
be able to add to your vita (resum¨¦) and may increase your chances of
admission to graduate school. You also earn 2 quarter hours of course credit
(your choice of BHS200 or BHS400) or student assistant funds. There is a
corresponding expectation of approximately 6 clock hours of your time per
week.

_19\. How do you feel about pagers and cell phones in class?_

**If they are silent (e.g., set to vibrate), okay.**   Audible cell phones and
pagers are a distraction to other students and should be turned off.  Thanks.

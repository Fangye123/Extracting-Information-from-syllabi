**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

This course provides methods for teaching mathematics and science and the
integration of content. The focus will be on theory, teaching strategies, and
hands-on learning. A study of instructional methods, curricular design, and
scope and sequence for the teaching and integrating of mathematics and science
in elementary and middle school settings will be included. An inquiry-centered
approach is inherent throughout the course to promote investigation and
critical thinking on the part of preservice teachers.

**TEACHER PREPARATION MISSION**

The mission of Teacher Preparation is to prepare empowered educators at the
graduate and undergraduate level to provide for all learners the capability to
live, learn and work successfully within the complexity of the world today.

**GOAL**

The goal of Teacher Preparation is to prepare educators to meet the needs of
learners in a variety of settings. This goal is addressed through effective
advising, quality teaching and interaction, conducting and disseminating
scholarly activity, and service within the university system, the community
and the field. This goal is most effectively achieved in a collegial
educational and administrative environment.

**ACADEMIC HONESTY  
** Effective learning may involve differences between students and faculty.
Students are responsible for learning the content of courses of study outlined
by the instructor regardless of privately-held judgments. They must also
demonstrate their attainment in an honest manner. Students who compromise the
integrity of the academic process are subject to disciplinary action on the
part of the Department of Teacher Education, the College of Education and Fort
Hays State University. See Student Handbook.

**  
REACTION PAPERS  
** Reaction papers are reviews of journal articles, books or other assignments
that are designed to elicit your reactions and responses. The 3-R format
should be used when writing a reaction paper.

The structural response is divided into three categories that closely resemble
Bloom's Taxonomy of the domains of learning - cognitive, affective and
psychomotor. The difference is that the 3-R format deals with the reaction of
the affective domain first, rather than the cognitive, as does Bloom. The
rationale for the difference in placement is to increase your awareness of
affective response, and then address the cognitive merit of the learning
regardless of the positive or negative affect associated with it. Include the
following in your reaction papers.

  1. Reaction (Affective Domain, To Feel) Explain your response (favorable, unfavorable, mixed). Cite at least one example from the readings that illustrates your response.
  2. Relevance (Cognitive Domain, To Think) How is the article or text related to the issue at hand? You should discuss or describe how the article is meaningful or contributes to the understandings of the course and/or issues being discussed. Cite at least one example from the readings to support your ideas.
  3. Responsibility (Psychomotor Domain, To Do) How will the knowledge gained from the event be used in your every day and professional life? Give at least one example of possible application in your personal and one in your professional life.

**Course Description:** In this introduction to Christianity,we will examine
the nature of Christianity and Christian self-understanding in its
multifaceted world context. After a brief orientation to the framework of
Christian history, the course will proceed thematically, exploring a range of
beliefs and practices in theological, social, cultural, and historical
contexts. In examining any given theme, we will range widely over time and
space, considering a variety of approaches to each subject from within Roman
Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Protestant, and dissenting traditions. The course
does not presume a familiarity with Christianity in any of its manifestations,
and students with a personal background in one Christian tradition will be
encouraged to expand their understanding of the religion from a variety of
perspectives. **  
  
Required Texts:**

_New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha_  
Saint Augustine, _Confessions_  
Shusaku Endo, _Silence_  
Mary Doria Russell, _The Sparrow_  
Sandra Frankiel, _Christianity_  
__

**Also:** selected internet documents, linked to the syllabus. __

**Students are expected to bring reading materials to class on the day(s) they
are assigned.**

**Course Requirements** : Students are expected to attend all lectures
(Mondays and Wednesdays) and participate in weekly discussion (Fridays). Out
of respect for fellow students as well as the professor, please be on time!
_Each week's reading is to be completed by Friday._ In addition to the
readings, there will be four films to view over the course of the semester.
These will be held on reserve at the Geddes Language Center for individual
viewing at your convenience during the week they are assigned. You are to view
each film before that week's Friday session. Written work for the class will
consist of brief, [non-graded weekly reaction papers](reaction.html), [one
five- to seven-page paper](worship.html) based upon observation of a Christian
worship service, a take-home midterm exam, and a scheduled final exam. The
grading for the course will be as follows: 20% for class participation, 20%
for the paper, 20% for the midterm and 40% for the final. The class
participation grade will be based on attendance at lecture and discussion,
thoughtfulness of weekly reaction papers, participation in discussion, and the
level of your preparedness and involvement in the course.

If you know you will be unable to attend class due to illness or an emergency,
you should make every effort to alert me in advance (or to let me know of the
circumstances of your absence as soon as possible) by e-mail or voice mail.
More than three unexcused absences during the semester will result in a
lowered overall grade in addition to an unsatisfactory class participation
grade.

Please note that students must complete all written work in order to receive a
passing grade for the class.

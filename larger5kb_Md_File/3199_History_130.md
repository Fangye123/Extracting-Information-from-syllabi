History 130s - Asian Studies 101s  
INTRODUCTION TO CHINESE CIVILIZATION

This course will introduce you to the culture and history of China from its
beginnings in the 2nd millenium B.C. to the 16th century. This project, which
we will attempt in thirteen weeks, is roughly equivalent in geographical and
temporal scope to the study of all Euro-Mediterranean history and cultures
from the earliest Pharoahs of Egypt to the Age of Elizabeth I (usually done in
three semesters). Needless to say, we are not going to cover all the available
material. Rather, we will focus on fundamental issues in Chinese history:
economic and technological evolution; the growth, power, structures, and
ideologies of the state; relations with and perceptions of other peoples; and
intellectual and social life.

The course includes both textbook readings and selections from primary
sources, which will give you a more intense and immediate sense of what it was
like to be a Chinese person in a specific place and time. These include
prescriptive texts (e.g., "how to be a good person"), philosophical texts
(e.g., "what it means to be a good person"), and cautionary tales (e.g., "this
is a bad person, don't be that way"), all drawn from the vast and self-
conscious literature of a long-lived culture. Throughout the course, we will
stress the multiplicity of China, its rich and complex history, rather than
any simplistic narrative based on a unified state. In addition to change over
time, we will discuss variables such as region, gender, class, religion,
education, and personality as precluding easy generalizations about "being
Chinese."

The course requirements are:  
1\. Attendance at class;  
2\. Completion of readings on time;  
3\. A map exercise (due February 4);  
4\. A midterm examination (March 13);  
5\. Two short essays (due March 6 and April 24); and  
6\. A final examination.

You should always bring the assigned texts to class with you, for we will
refer to them and deal specifically with their arguments and evidence. I
recommend that you take notes as you go through the readings and that you
bring those notes, and any questions you have about the texts, with you to
class. The following books have been ordered at the Odyssey Bookshop:  
Patricia B. Ebrey, The Cambridge Illustrated History of China (Ebrey, History)  
Patricia B. Ebrey, Chinese Civilization: A Sourcebook (Ebrey, Sourcebook)  
Donald S. Lopez, Religions of China in Practice  
Jacques Gernet, Daily Life in China on the Eve of the Mongol Invasion  
Arthur Waley (trans.), The Analects of Confucius  
A small packet of readings will be available from the History Department.
Readings from the packet are numbered in the syllabus.

Map Exercise  
(due February 4th)

Using a very recent standard map of China as your base map, create your own
sketch map of East Asia, including China, Korea, Mongolia, and Japan. This
will be yours to use for the semester, so you should make it a convenient,
portable size. You may trace, sketch, or computer-generate your map. Carefully
label all of the items listed below on your map.

1\. Your map should include the following topographical features:  
Himalaya Mountains  
Altai Mountains  
Taihang Mountains  
Pamir Mountains  
Yellow River (Huang He, Huang Ho)  
Yangtze River (Chang Jiang, Ch'ang Chiang)  
West River (Xi Jiang, Hsi Chiang)  
Wei River (in Shaanxi/Shensi Province)  
Hainan Island  
Taiwan Island  
Tarim Basin  
Gobi Desert

2\. In addition, you should indicate the position of the following cities:  
Xi'an (Sian)  
Beijing (Peking)  
Loyang  
Kaifeng  
Hangzhou (Hangchow)  
Suzhou (Soochow)  
Nanjing (Nanking)  
Guangzhou (Kwangchow, Canton)

3\. Locate the following outside of contemporary China's borders:  
Korean peninsula  
Mongolia  
Vietnam  
Japan (including the names of the four main islands)

4\. On the back of your map, name all of the contemporary countries which
share land borders with China. There are currently fourteen, and maps made
before the 1990s will lead you astray, for there have been many changes in the
past thirteen years.  
First Essay Assignment  
(due March 6)

From the list below, obtain and read one of the Chinese classical texts in
translation Write a five (5) page paper placing it in the intellectual-social-
political context we have studied thus far. Rely not only on the primary text
itself, and the translator's introduction and commentary, but also on the
analyses of cultural climate in Ebrey, on comparisons with the sources
translated in Lopez and the Sourcebook, and on other primary and secondary
sources you might locate on your own.

Your paper should answer all of the following questions (if not more): Where
does your text belong in the Chinese intellectual tradition? What are its
major contributions and themes? How did reading it affect or change the
impression you have thus far gained of Chinese culture? How do the ideas in
the text compare to other ideas you have read in other texts?

All of the following are available in English. There are many translations of
some of them (over 50 of the Laozi, for example), so please be sure to use a
scholarly (rather than a New Age or hip) translation. If you have any doubts,
check with me. The Wade-Giles romanization, the more common one for classical
studies, is followed by the pinyin in parentheses.

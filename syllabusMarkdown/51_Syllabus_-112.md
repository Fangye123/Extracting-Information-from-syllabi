_Course Description_  

This course will explore the political, military, social, and cultural history
of Europe from 1660 to the present, as well as how we use this past to define
ourselves today.  Originally, professors consciously designed western
civilization surveys to present the United States and Western Europe as the
logical endpoint of human cultural development.  This, of course, is a very
pleasing way of seeing ourselves; it allows us to dismiss the dark side of our
history, label mass-violence as non-western, and ignore pressing problems in
our society by claiming that we live in the best of times.  At the beginning
of the twenty-first century, we need a new interpretation of the west.

In this course we want to explore the transition of Europe form a stable world
of peasants, artisans and aristocrats to the mobile, democratic, industrial
world we inhabit today.  The French Revolution of 1789 proclaimed liberty,
equality and fraternity to be the rights of all people and the watchwords of
the west.  How have these concepts fared since then?

Just as important, some of the leading thinkers in Europe during the
Revolution envisaged history and modern society as something that would build
bridges between peoples and enable progress and understanding.  Has this in
fact taken place, or does our knowledge of our history hinder us as much as it
helps when we come into contact with other people, other places, and other
ideas?  In order to answer these questions, we will focus on western Europe,
but we will also ask how Europeans impacted the rest of the world, and how
non-Europeans changed the west.  We will admire the intellectual power and
rationality of the scientific revolution and the Enlightenment, but we will
also stand in dismay at the totalitarian regimes inspired by the belief that
the world and people can be completely controlled.  We will explore the
awesome power and wealth unleashed by industrialization, and the same time we
quail at the human cost inflicted on workers in the name of prosperity and
technology.  We will pay close attention to the nation as a way to mobilize
power, and the justification it provided for eliminating unwanted groups.  As
part of this last endeavor, we need to look beyond those who benefited from
democratization and industrialization, and focus on groups who existed on the
margins.  In a survey course of this size where time is limited, we will focus
on two minorities; women and Jews.  We will try to use their experiences to
get a view of Europe from the other side.

To sum up, western civilization is a Janus-faced construction, and we need to
look at it from multiple perspectives in order to understand how these people
viewed themselves, how culture functions, and how we use the past to define
ourselves.

_Required Texts_  

      ·        McKay, Hill, and Buckler, _A History of Western Society_ , vol. I, 6th edition.  
·        Voltaire, _Candide_  
·         Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, _The Communist Manifesto_  
·          Henrik Ibsen, A Dolls house in _Four Great Plays by Henrik
Ibsen_  
·          Primo Levi, _The Drowned and the Saved_  
·         Bharati Mukherjee, _Jasmine_  

As can be seen, there is a healthy amount of reading in this course.  This
reflects our three major, pedagogical goals: 1) careful and critical reading,
2) effective analysis and reasoning, 3) clear and accurate written
presentation.  Students who take responsibility for their own learning will
leave this course with a better knowledge of the important events, people and
ideas of western history, and with the facility in the fundamental skills
essential to success in future university courses and in any other
intellectual work.  The TAs will discuss the specifics of the reading
assignments with you.  

Each lecture will present the terms necessary to understand and discuss
western civilization: these concepts and definitions are the key to success on
the course assignments.  The lectures will not review the material in the
textbook - reading the textbook is your responsibility.  Each week, the
discussion sections will center on close readings of primary sources, major
themes in the course, and on the relationship between text and context.

The  course requirements are: 1) regular class attendance, 2) completion of
all readings, 3) participation in discussion section meetings, 4) one hourly
and one final exam, 5) the writing assignments.  

The exams will be essay-based, and will draw heavily on material from lecture,
as well as discussion section, the textbook, and the primary sources.  The
final will be cumulative.  The breakdown of grades is as follows:

      1)     Mid-term 15%  
2)     Final exam 25%  
3)     Discussion section 40%*  
4)     Base writing assign. 20%*

*Your TA will discuss specifics on the writing assignments with you (these will depend on whether or not you are in a writing-intensive section).  The proportion of the grade assigned to the section and the writing assignments may change depending on whether you are taking HIS 112 or HIS 113

## **Legal Studies 2010  
Introduction to Legal Studies  
Brad R. Roth**

**

### Fall 1999  
3 credits  
T-Th 11:45-1:10  
212 State

**

#### Materials:

James V. Calvi & Susan Coleman, _American Law and Legal Systems_ (Prentice-
Hall, 4th ed. 1999). **[ "CC"]**

David M. Adams, ed., _Philosophical Problems in the Law_ (Wadsworth Pub. Co.,
2d ed. 1996). **[ "PPL"]**

Supplementary materials (case excerpts or short commentaries) as may be handed
out and assigned from time to time.

#### Course Description and Objectives:

This is the foundation course for the Minor in Legal Studies. Its purpose is
to lay the groundwork for multidisciplinary study of legal concepts and
institutions. That is to say, the course seeks to increase your understanding
of the nature and functions of law in society, so as to improve your ability
to undertake law-related studies in the social sciences (e.g., anthropology,
economics, political science, psychology, sociology), humanities (e.g.,
history, philosophy, literature), or applied fields (e.g., criminal justice,
public policy, social work). It is not specifically a "pre-law" class; indeed,
while it will help you to understand what it means to "think like a lawyer,"
it will seek to foster a critical perspective on the way that lawyers are
trained to think.

The course has two components, represented by the two textbooks that we will
use. Calvi & Coleman ("CC") is an elementary guide to the American legal
system and to basic concepts in American law. We will move through the reading
assignments in this book rather quickly. My lectures will often use the book's
description of a given institution as a jumping-off point for an expanded
discussion of that institution's operation in theory and practice, or for a
comparison of the American institution with its counterpart in a foreign
system.

By contrast, the _Philosophical Problems in the Law_ collection ( "PPL") is an
introduction to legal theory. The readings here, which are much more
challenging, develop theoretical views about the true nature and proper
functions of law, and apply these views to topical issues (e.g., retroactive
prosecutions, hate speech, affirmative action, gay rights, strict tort
liability). Class discussion will focus on the competing views expressed by
the various authors; the point will be to explore, not how we all feel about a
controversial issue, but how a particular view of the nature and function of
law in society can lead to a justification for a particular judicial or
administrative decision (even a decision that may not suit our personal
preferences).

The class will involve both lecture and discussion. Students who do not
volunteer to participate in class discussion can expect to be prompted to do
so.

#### Course Requirements:

The grade in this course will be based on:

1\. A 3-5 page paper, based on the reading materials, on a topic to be
assigned at the beginning of Week 3 (9/21/99), due at the end of Week 4
(9/30/99), worth 10% of the grade. (During Week 5, all students will be
expected to come to see me by appointment to discuss their performance on the
paper.)

2\. An in-class mid-term examination at the end of Week 8 (10/28/99), worth
20% of the grade.

3\. A 7-9 page paper, requiring a limited amount of outside reading, on a
topic to be developed by the student in consultation with the instructor and
_**outlined no later than the end of Week 10 (11/11/99)**_ , due at the
beginning of Week 12 (11/23/99), worth 25% of the grade.

4\. A cumulative final examination, as scheduled during the examination period
(Tuesday, 12/21/99, 10:40-1:10 PM), worth 35% of the grade.

5\. Class participation, worth 10% of the grade.

#### Relevant Office Information:

My Office: F/AB 2055, 577-6335, brad.roth@wayne.edu

Legal Studies Office (Debra Viles): F/AB 3081, 577-3947, d.viles@wayne.edu

I will be holding office hours on Thursdays, 2:00-4:00 P.M., in my Political
Science office. I am also available by appointment almost any day. In addition
to being available to answer questions on topics covered in the course, I am
eager to get to know each of you, to confer about your academic or career
plans, and to discuss any legal issues that you find of interest. Do not be
shy about coming by.

#### Class Policies:

* Class attendance is mandatory. More than four (4) unexcused absences will result in a penalty of one full letter grade. Habitual lateness will also be penalized. 

* Students will be expected to come to class prepared either to answer questions about the readings or to raise questions about what they did not understand. 

* Students are expected at all times to be respectful of their instructor and of one another. This entails, among other things, arriving to class on time, avoiding behavior that tends to distract attention, and maintaining civility when expressing disagreement.

* Papers shall be typed, double-spaced, with reasonable letter size and margins.

* Papers will be graded on content, organization, presentation style (e.g., paragraph structure, grammar, spelling), and proper use of citations (where applicable). Examinations will be graded mainly on content, but significant deficits in other aspects will count against the grade.

* Late papers will be subject to a penalty of 1/3 of a letter grade (.33 on a 4.0 scale) _**per calendar day**_ , except where extraordinary circumstances can be demonstrated. 

* No make-up exams will be scheduled without good cause, such as credible evidence of illness or family emergency.

* Students failing to complete all required work by the end of the term will receive a grade of E; no grade of I (Incomplete) will be granted except where extraordinary circumstances can be demonstrated.

* Cheating, plagiarism, and all other forms of academic dishonesty or misconduct are prohibited and will not be tolerated. Students who are uncertain as to whether contemplated conduct constitutes a violation are responsible for raising the question in advance. No question is a stupid question, but an effort to sneak something by will be treated harshly. Incidents will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the Student Due Process Statute, copies of which may be obtained by the student from Student Support Services, Room 470, Student Center Building.

* Students are responsible for knowledge of and compliance with University policies, as set forth in the University _Bulletin_.

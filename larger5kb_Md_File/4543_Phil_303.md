Our main interest will be the views of DLLBHK in three areas:
ontology/metaphysics,  
especially the concepts of substance, space and time, and causation;
epistemology: what  
can we know and how do we know it?; philosophy of science, roughly the
implications of  
views in the preceding two areas for science and scientific knowledge.

_Course Requirements_ :

The first and most important requirement is that you do the readings and
attend class  
prepared to participate and to learn.  There is fair amount of reading, much
of it is quite  
difficult.  You cannot expect to do well in the course unless you keep up with
the reading,  
make notes as you go along, and come to class.

For those of you not taking the course for honors (the vast majority), your
grade depends  
on three factors: a midterm exam, a final exam, and a term paper.  Questions
for the exams  
(short essay type) will be distributed beforehand so that you will have chance
to prepare  
your answers, but the essays themselves will be written in class without the
aid of notes.  
The term paper, chosen from a list of assigned topics, should be about eight
pages  
(reckoned at 250 words per page), typed, double-spaced.  The midterm exam is
on  
Thursday, March 8.  The term paper is due on Thursday, April 19.  The date of
the final  
will be announced.  The paper and each exam accounts for one third of your
grade for the  
course.

_Honors Students_

If you are taking the course for honors, the requirements are different (and
my  
expectations higher).  You are required to write three papers, about ten to
fifteen pages  
each (reckoned at 250 words per page), typed, double-spaced.  The topics will
be chosen  
by you, but only after consulting with me and getting my approval.  Typically,
the topics  
will require some independent research and further reading (which I will try
to help you  
with).  The first paper is due on Thursday, February 8, the second on
Thursday, March  
8, the third on Thursday, May 3.

_Dire Warnings_ :

No exam can be made up, and no late paper will be accepted, without a note
from your  
physician or a letter explaining your absence that your instructor-that's me-
finds  
acceptable.

Note that completion of all written work is a necessary condition for passing
the course.

Cheating and plagiarism are serious offences.  Plagiarism includes, but is not
limited to,  
copying sentences and paragraphs from books or web sites without attribution.
Cheating  
on exams, or failing to cite sources quoted or paraphrased in papers, will
result in an "F"  
grade for the course and a report to the Dean of Students.  


**Phil 303 Topics and Reading Assignments**  


This is only a rough guide but I will try to stick to it as far as possible.
Undoubtedly, parts  
of it will be modified, stretched, and trimmed as we go along.

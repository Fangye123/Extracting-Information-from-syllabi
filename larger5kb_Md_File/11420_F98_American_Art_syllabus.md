  **SYLLABUS**  

**Course description and goals:**

This course introduces American art through study of selected artists and
works of art, many of them in local museums.  We will trace the evolution of
distinct artistic traditions in the colonies and expanding republic, the
influences of European models and American experience, and will identify
recurring themes and issues in American art. Turning to the twentieth century,
we will study both continuities and changes in the character of art in
American life.  Some classes will emphasize social and political contexts
while others will focus on artistic concerns. Active participation is
essential: you need to see and think about the works as they are presented.
Practice in looking, comparing, and relating what you see to other images and
forms helps to develop a skill basic to the field of art history.

The readings provide historical framework, information on artists, and
comparative material not always covered in class. The textbook does not
duplicate the lectures; you'll need to use the book along with the review
sheets and your notes. Museum assignments and papers will let you study works
of art in the original. The format and content of papers and tests will be
explained in hand-outs and discussed in class, and I'll be glad to talk with
you about your work or any aspect of the course.

**MUSEUM ESSAY** \--   **The American Scene  **    Due Sept. 22

Choose two works to study in the original as the basis for a short essay
(2-3pp) comparing two views of American life. The works may be in any medium,
at least one must date before 1900. Make sketches of the works, and take notes
about their visual characteristics; get postcards if you can, but don't rely
on them for your direct observation.

Determine your own theme: think of a title, and indicate your main point as
clearly as possible in an introductory paragraph. The paper should contain
precise observations of both works--their visual elements, their subjects,
their ways of expressing effects or ideas--and these observations should be
organized carefully to convey your ideas clearly. Provide a conclusion stating
what your observations and interpretations have demonstrated (you might have
realized something new about the works at this point; perhaps revise your
title and introduction). Take time to reread and edit.

The finished paper will include: 1) Cover page with your title, your name and
the date; and information about each work-- Artist, title, date, medium, and
museum; 2) text of your essay (2-3pp), with footnotes or endnotes; 3)
bibliography of any books or articles you consulted; 4) your sketches or
reproductions. Please type with standard, dark print, double-spaced, with 1"
margins; do not use special binders, but staple the pages.

**TERM PAPER --** Due Nov. 24

One purpose of the term paper is to allow you to study artists and ideas that
particularly interest you in more depth than we can do in class; another is to
give members of the class a chance to share some of the results of their work.
To insure that you can work in a way that is integral to the course, and not
in a vacuum, I have listed several broad themes and ideas considered in class
that go beyond single periods, regions, or stylistic tendencies. The subjects
you choose for your term papers will allow you to investigate some of these
ideas through the perspectives of individual artists. More than one of you may
be interested in the same issues, and I encourage you to talk about your
subjects and compare notes as you work on your papers. Near the end of the
semester, we'll have class sessions in which you can present and discuss your
material.

The attached list suggests broad topics that are relevant to several artists.
Begin thinking about them as you preview the material covered in your textbook
and start your museum looking assignments. If you haven't written an art
history paper before, you might find Barnet's _A Short Guide to Writing about
Art_ helpful. As you clarify your focus, choose an artist whose work involves
a theme or issue that interests you. Be sure that you can study at least one
work by that artist in the original; it does not need to be a major work, but
you must be able to include specific discussion of it in your paper.  


  * Sign up for a general topic as soon as you can (consult with me if you wish) - by 9/17.
  * Prepare a statement indicating your general theme and the artist on whom you'll focus. Give a tentative working title for your paper. Write a concise paragraph discussing your approach or the major questions you hope to answer. Identify at least one work that you'll examine in the original (title, date, location). Provide a preliminary bibliography, including both primary and secondary sources, and indicating which books and articles you've already looked at. Due 9/29.
  * Plan to have your paper nearly finished, at least in draft form, by 11/17, when we will begin a series of discussion sessions at which you will have an opportunity to present your research to the class. Finished papers are to be handed in 11/24.

The process of writing an art history term paper and the required format are
described in the attached [Guidelines for Art History
Papers](../../hilton/web/guide.htm).  Refer to these guidelines throughout the
semester.

For all your work in this course, be sure that you understand Georgetown's
policies on academic integrity.

**READING**

The main textbook, Wayne Craven, _American Art. History and Culture_ (Brown  &
Benchmark, 1994) is at the GU bookstore; several recommended general books are
on reserve. These may be used for reference and as supplements to lectures
throughout the semester: Taylor's _America as Art_ offers insights into
continuities between 19th and 20th century developments and helpful
discussions of the social contexts in which art evolved in America. In
addition, several collections of source materials - writings by artists and
contemporary critics, will be useful for work on individual topics. Use
Craven's bibliography for specialized studies and works on individual artists.

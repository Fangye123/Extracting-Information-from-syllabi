This course is a graduate-level introduction to the scholarly study of race,
gender, and sexuality designed to be of use to students in history, women's
studies, ethnic studies, cultural studies, and related disciplines. We will
begin with three units designed to introduce you to scholarly theories (one
each on gender, sexuality, and race), and then devote the rest of our sessions
to analyzing a series of specific historical topics.

**_Course Requirements:_**

The first requirement for this course (as for any other graduate colloquium)
is to come to class prepared to discuss the weekly reading assignments.

In addition, I require:

  * A 2-3 page written [Report and Bibliography](report%20and%20bibliography%20assignment.htm) on the work of a selected historian. Brief summaries of these reports will be given in class at a rate of 2 reports each week beginning October 16 and ending November 20.  
  

  * A 12-14 page written [Synthetic Critical Essay ](synthetic%20critical%20essay%20assignment.htm)evaluating a set of readings on a topic of your choice. Topic choices must be made and approved by me by ; first drafts are due ; final papers are due. As in any graduate colloquium, your grade will depend largely on the quality of the critical paper you produce, so be sure to choose your topic carefully, listen closely to the class discussions we'll have about constructing these papers, and schedule lots of time for writing, revision and rewriting. As part of this assignment, each student will provide written critiques of the paper drafts of two other students.

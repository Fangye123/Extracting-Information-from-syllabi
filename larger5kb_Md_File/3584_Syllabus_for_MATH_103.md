**Course Description**  
Catalog description: Basic concepts from the following topics: sets,
mathematical logic, numeration systems, number theory, probability,
statistics, algebra, geometry, metric system, consumer mathematics. This
course does not apply on a major or minor in mathematics. (3 hours)

    Most students take this course to fulfill general education mathematics requirements, although some students are required to take it for their major. If you have a question about whether you are required to take this course, please ask me. Some students may benefit more from a different math course.   
    We will study most of textbook chapters 4, 5, 8, 9, 10 (some), 11, 12, and 13, although not in this order. These chapters include probability, statistics, the real number system, elementary algebra, geometry, consumer mathematics, and the metric system.   
    Although I will often teach by lecturing, I expect you to be an active learner during class by arriving on time each day, bringing a calculator, taking notes, asking questions, responding to my questions, and working problems and doing activities with me and your classmates. We will do activities in class, such as metric measuring and probability simulations, that you cannot make up outside of class.   
    Outside of class you should read the textbook and do your homework, of course. You can study with a friend or see me or a tutor for help. Organize your class notes, homework and quiz papers, and syllabus in a 3-ring binder. Suggestions for organizing your binder are in the syllabus.   
    It is very important for you to do your homework faithfully. I will assign, collect, and grade homework almost every class period. Pick up your papers and restudy the parts you missed. When my reader and I grade your homework and tests, we will check your steps and explanations. Learning to show your work will earn you partial credit, but more importantly, it will help you to better understand math concepts and solution methods and enable you to communicate those ideas to others.   
    Students who are preparing to be teachers will benefit from the teaching methods used in this course. I suggest you pay attention to the types of activities, hands-on materials, and applications of math to everyday life. 

**Goals**  
Students will:

  * appreciate the usefulness of mathematics in everyday life, including one's values and lifestyle choices.
  * solve a variety of word problems involving arithmetic, algebra, consumer mathematics, probability, statistics, geometry, and the metric system.

**Attendance**  
Regular attendance is expected. An excessive number of absences, for whatever
reasons, may subject you to dismissal from the course. You are allowed three
absences without penalizing your grade. Leaving class before dismissal and
sleeping in class count as absences. (See university catalog, p. 46.)

**Homework**  
I will announce homework assignments in class and post them on my web page
(see the attached homework assignment sheet). I will collect homework as
announced in class, usually at the beginning of class each day.  
    * You may use both sides of the paper.   
    * Begin each section's homework at the top of the page.   
    * Be neat and clear and show your work. Sloppy papers will not be accepted.   
Put the following information in the upper right-hand corner on the _inside,_
then fold your paper lengthwise from left to right and put the same
information on the _outside_ at the top:  
    * your name   
    * Survey A   
    * textbook section number(s)   
Your homework and quiz papers will be graded and returned to you in the
pigeonhole boxes in the hall outside your classroom (unless you ask me not to
put them there). I expect you to pick up your papers often, restudy the parts
you missed, and organize your papers in a 3-ring binder.

**Quizzes**  
We will often have practice quizzes, which help you and me assess your
progress and understanding, but which will not count in your grade.
Occasionally we will have quizzes that will count in your grade. Sometimes,
but not always, I will announce these quizzes in advance. I will not give any
make-up quizzes.

**Late Papers and Throw Outs**  
You may turn in one late paper with a Late Homework Coupon. Otherwise, no late
papers will be accepted. To allow for excused absences, at the end of the
semester I will throw out your three lowest homework and quiz scores.

**Tests**  
We will have three unit tests and a comprehensive final exam. If you miss a
test due to a school-sponsored trip, illness, or other circumstances beyond
your control, _you may request an excused absence by contacting me in advance
or as soon as possible after the test. I require a written explanation._ If I
excuse your absence, I will either give you a make-up test or use your final
exam score for the missed test. In the case of school-sponsored trips, please
contact me a week in advance.

**     Comprehensive Final Exam 10:00 - 12:00, Wednesday, May 8**  
_     Make your travel plans early. The final exam must be taken at the
scheduled time._  
_     See the Final Exam Schedule and the university catalog for policies
concerning examinations (p. 46)._

**Calculators**  
You must have a calculator and bring it to class each day. You may use a
calculator for all homework, quizzes, and tests. But even though you use a
calculator to do the computations, you should **show your work,** that is,
show what numbers you are using and whether you are adding, multiplying, etc.
(You may use any model you wish. The Casio fx-300W and TI-30Xa Solar are good
choices. They are available at the Campus Shop and other stores for about $12
- $15.)

**Academic Honesty**  
You may work together on homework, but simply copying another person's work is
prohibited, of course. Cheating on homework, quizzes, or tests will result in
a grade of zero on the assignment or test and possibly a failing grade in the
course. A second offense will result in dismissal from the course and possibly
from the university. (See the university catalog, p. 43.)

**Dress Code**  
Thank you for observing the dress code (see the Student Handbook). In
particular, thanks for not wearing shorts, jewelry, or torn clothing in
classroom buildings at any time. I will appreciate your not wearing caps in
class.

#  

|

  1. Have thorough understanding of the mathematics that you will be expected to teach.

  2. Be able to express that understanding to a student and to another teacher. 
  3. Be able to structure the learning of another, specifically a student, in a way that is logical but also learnable.
  4. Develop some facility to think about mathematics and mathematical problems. 
  5. Learn to become autonomous (self-governing, able to undertake or carry out without outside control) in both your mathematical work and your evaluation of that work. 
  6. Learn to work with manipulatives on topics that will be taught in elementary school.
  7. Become an accomplished problem solver and critical thinker.

**Postings:**

> You will be expected to post a total of 50 messages throughout the semester.
I will have different bulletin board topics for class discussion. Since we
learn best through communication, I strongly recommend that you participate in
**every** topic on the bulletin board.

>

> At the end of the semester your total will be tallied and **you will lose 1
point for every posting less than 50.**  
  
---  
**Group Discussion Topics (50 points):**  
  
> You will be assigned to a group for the semester. Your group will
communicate weekly through your group's private bulletin board and/or in the
chat room (you will make arrangements with your group members to meet in the
chat room). Every Monday I will display a weekly group discussion topic on the
course homepage. Your group must e-mail me the results of your discussions by
the next Monday for 10 points. There will be a total of 5 group discussion
topics that you will submit to me.  
  
**Quizzes (50 points):**  
  
> There will be 5 quizzes worth 10 points each. They are similar to the
assigned practice problems out of the text. Quizzes can be accessed in the
Lecture Notes. **Quizzes will not be accepted late.**  
  
**Miscellaneous Assignments (100 points):**  
---  
  
> Miscellaneous assignments may include journal article reflections, other
written assignments, internet searches, etc . . . There are 5 Miscellaneous
Assignments worth 20 points each. Your name, assignment number (ex: MA1),
course and section number (ex: DE201) must be at the top of the assignment.
Miscellaneous Assignments can be accessed from the course homepage in WebCT.  
  
**Final Project (100 points):**  
---  
  
> You will be expected to complete a group final project. Instructions for the
final project can be accessed from the course homepage in WebCT. The final
project is worth 100 points.  
  
**Tests and Final Exam (400 points):**  
---  
  
> There will be two tests given, each worth 200 points. Make-up tests will
only be given in the case of extreme circumstances. Test dates are in the
course calendar.

  * Las Vegas, North Las Vegas and Henderson residents MUST take tests at the CCSN Cheyenne Campus Assessment Center. 
  * Las Vegas Area CCSN Rural Testing Sites are available (Pahrump, Logandale, Overton, etc. . .). You must let me know at the beginning of the semester if you plan on taking the tests at a CCSN Rural Site. 
  * Individuals from out-of-state MUST make arrangements with me for other testing sites. 

**You will have to check your personal schedules and make any necessary
arrangements in order to take these tests.**

  
  
**About This Course:**  
---  
  
This course is likely different from any other math class you have taken. The
goal is to develop your ability to read, write, think and do mathematics. Much
of the content may be familiar for many of you, but this course challenges you
to learn it in a new way that should raise you to a higher level of
mathematical understanding. This course is designed to build connected
conceptual understanding as well as reinforce previously learned knowledge and
skills. As pre-service teachers you will be exposed to a different kind of
learning experience, which hopefully will aid in your preparation as an
elementary school teacher. This is not a methods course, **you will not learn
how to teach mathematics**. Rather, it is a course that will enhance your own
learning of mathematics.  
  
**Time Requirements:**  
  
THIS WILL BE A TIME INTENSIVE 8-WEEK COURSE. In an average semester week you
will probably spend a minimum of 12-16 hours on this course. Since this is an
8-week session, I suggest you log on at least 5 days per week, spending at
least 20 hours per week. This includes reading the lecture notes, doing the
practice problems, taking the quizzes, doing the miscellaneous assignments,
preparing your final project, group discussion questions, spending time in the
chat room and bulletin board, and taking the tests. BE PREPARED TO IMMERSE
YOURSELF INTO THIS COURSE AND TO DEVOTE A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY.  
  
**Technology Requirements:**  
  
It is highly recommended that you have YOUR OWN Power Mac or IBM-compatible
computer. Students who plan on using the CCSN computer lab may be at a
disadvantage because of possible access problems. If you have computer-related
problems, you may either contact me or the CCSN technology support staff
(phone 651-4962).  
**How to go about this course:**  
  
  * **Read the current week's assignment in the course calendar. (on the course homepage)**
  * **Read the lecture notes pertaining to the current assignment. (on the course homepage)**
  * **Read the corresponding text sections.**
  * **Do the corresponding practice problems.**
  * **Be in touch with your group regularly. (using your group's private bulletin board)**
  * **Discuss the material and assigned problems via the Bulletin Board, Chat Room or E-Mail.**
  * **On Mondays check the course homepage for the weekly Group Discussion topic.**
  * **Meet with your group members weekly (in a chatroom or use your private group bulletin board).**
  * **Keep up with the quizzes and test schedule.**
  * **Keep up with assigned Miscellaneous Assignments.**
  * **Work on your Final Project throughout the semester.**

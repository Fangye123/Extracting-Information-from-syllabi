Introduction  
This course will introduce students to the dynamic field of environmental
history, presenting essential concepts, concerns, and methods in the context
of American history. Units will address environmental issues in vastly
different historical settings, ranging from the Precolumbian world to the
modern, industrial United States. Because of the breadth of its focus, the
course complements and extends both United State history (HIST 201-3) and
world history (HIST 120-2), and helps prepare students for advanced work in
history courses across the history department curriculum, as well as in
Environmental Studies.

Within the last few decades, environmental history has emerged as an important
subfield. Though it is defined variously by practitioners, at base it studies
the relationship between humans and their physical environments, understanding
such relationships as "dialogues" between societies and the material
(including the "natural") circumstances of their existence. Some environmental
historians emphasize culture and intellectual themes, exploring the ways that
people have understood and represented the natural world and shaped it in
culturally specific ways. Others stress the essential economic foundations of
environmental relationships, focusing on the need to procure subsistence,
comfort, and wealth and the implications that such production has on physical
and natural environments. Still others have cast attention on the politics and
policy of humans' relationships with their environments, and how social and
political life--situated in landscapes--is often the object of negotiation and
struggle. Finally, others have seen environmental history as the study of
ecology, with people considered as essential (if sometimes disturbing)
elements within nature. Students will be acquainted with these various
approaches and the implications of different sorts of environmental history,
while situating their learning in the study of American history.

Course Format and Assignments  
The course will combine lecture with discussion, often weaving the two
together to make class sessions interactive. Lectures will generally build
upon--not simply recapitulate--readings. Students are responsible for
completing reading and written assignments by the time indicated on the
syllabus. These assignments will often provide the basis for class activity;
students are expected to attend all class meetings and participate actively.
Except in extraordinary circumstances, no work will be accepted late. Students
must complete all assignments in order to pass the course. There will be three
exams, as well as occasional short homework assignments and quizzes.

Academic integrity is important. I will hold all students to the University of
Oregon "Standards of Conduct." Plagiarism will not be tolerated; all work must
by your own, written for this class.

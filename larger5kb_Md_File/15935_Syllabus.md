## Course Objectives

In our "Conversations" we will read important works from antiquity and the
Middle Ages, exploring the world view they represent and studying how each
author rereads and rewrites works from the past. Our goal is that you join
this great chain of readers and writers. Our aims are that you develop your
critical thinking, expressive writing, and literary appreciation through
analysis of these texts and by active participation in the learning process
through your questions, class discussion, response papers, E-Mail and website
postings. Students should seek to work out a particular _take_ on each work
and to understand each in its historical context and in relation to aspects of
the development of Western art, thought, beliefs, and social experiences. By
the end of the course, moreover, we hope that each of you will feel at ease
working with the resources of Bobst Library and the Internet and that all will
have tasted something of the rich feast that NYU and New York City offer
students of antiquity and the Middle Ages.

Student Objectives  
  

  1. Students can use a cross-cultural perspective to identify how education--mediated by biological characteristics--is a cultural process, a sociocultural structure, a cultural transaction, and a cultural product.   
  

  2. Given at least two cultural settings, students can describe and explain how culture is both transmitted and transformed through such processes as enculturation, acculturation, and formal, informal, and nonformal modes of education.   
  

  3. Students can separate the sociocultural structure of education into macrocultural and microcultural systems and can outline effects of each on members of communities.   
  

  4. Students can analyze a variety of cultural transactions occurring within educational processes and settings and can illustrate--in a medium of their choice--such transactions from their own experiences as cultural actors.   
  

  5. Students can compare and contrast, through an illustrative diagram, a range of cultural productions of education and can assess the role of these productions within and across cultural settings.   
  

Course Requirements:  
  

  1. I expect regular attendance and will take excessive absences (missing more than 6 hours of a 45-hour course) into account in the final course grade.   
  

  2. I expect people to come to class prepared and to contribute to class discussions and activities. Frequent lack of preparation or failure to contribute will also be taken into account in the final course grade.   
  

  3. All students are required to have and to use an electronic mail account. These are available free in the Office of Information Technology, Aderhold 231. I will make periodic email assignments. These will all be assessed on a pass-fail basis. Failure to complete email assignments will be taken into account in the final course grade.   
  

  4. All students are required to complete three written assignments--two short ones and a class project. The final grade will be based on the following distribution:   

    1. Attendance, preparation, and discussion: 10% 
    2. Project overview: 20% 
    3. Project draft: 20% 
    4. Final version of project: 50%   
  

  
  
Requirements  
  

  1. Standard option A: A ten-page cultural life history   
  

  2. Standard option B: A ten-page position paper on some aspect of the relationship between culture and education.   
  

  3. Alternative: Student-designed, instructor-approved project.

I work in the social foundations of education program here at the University
of Georgia as well as in the College of Education's qualitative and
ethnographic research program. My degrees are an A.B. in history from Grinnell
College in 1964 and an M.A. (University of Minnesota) in 1971 and an Ed.D.
(Indiana University) in 1975, concentrating in anthropology and education. My
major scholarly interests and publications are in the areas of sociocultural
theory, gender studies, classroom social life, immigration and education, and
qualitative research design and methodology. My personal interests include
books, music, gardening, birding, miniature schnauzers, and ballroom dancing.

**T** his course will examine the history of the United States since 1945,
with a primary focus on media and presidential politics in the age of the Cold
War (1945-1990). We will look particularly at how television developed into
this nation's most important and influential medium. We will look at how
television, broadcast journalism, public relations, and advertising impacted
culture and politics during the Cold War.

**D** uring the course of the semester, we will look at a variety of
historical and journalistic interpretations of major events, themes, and
political/social theories. During this off-year election fall, we will
critique each presidential campaign from 1948 to 1988-examining the media,
advertising, electioneering, speeches, rhetoric and the overall "image" of
candidate. We will also use Daniel Boorstin's concept of "pseudo-events" to
examine the manipulation of the media by individuals and groups. From a media
perspective, we will look at the use of "agenda setting" to perhaps "distort"
the "news." From a historical perspective, we will examine traditional and
revisionist interpretations of each American president from Truman to Reagan--
all of this in a Cold War context.

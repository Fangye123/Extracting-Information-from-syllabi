  _SYLLABUS_

**DESCRIPTION:**

Interrogating Identity examines the complex nature of identity as represented
in film, literature and art.

**OBJECTIVES:**

1\. To understand through readings of literature and critical theory,
screening of films and videos, and looking at visual art diverse perspectives
including those of race, class, gender and sexuality on the complex issue of
identity.

2\. Through class discussions and individual projects, to demonstrate oral and
written command of the seminar content

3\. To evidence the ability to do independent research

**METHOD OF INSTRUCTION:**

This seminar will consist of discussions of issues related to the cultural
representation of identity. Readings from critical theory, contemporary
literature, film and video screenings, and visits to exhibitions will be used
to explore the problematic issue of identity and its relationship to race,
gender and sexuality. We will analyze a diversity of perspectives in order to
gain insight into the critical role identity plays in contemporary culture.
Drawing upon the readings, class presentations and dialogue, you will develop
your own interpretation of the course material for a final seminar project.
Attendance and participation in seminar discussions is an essential component
of the weekly meetings and is a critical factor in successful completion of
the seminar.

**ASSIGNMENTS:**

1\. Abstracts of Readings and Presentations: Each week there will be a reading
assignment which will be due for class discussion.  Each seminar participant
will write a brief, typed abstract (1-2 short paragraphs) that summarizes the
main points of the assigned texts.  These abstracts (with name, title of
seminar and date) are to be brought to class the day of the discussion and
will be handed in at the end of the seminar. Occasionally I will review them
to see if you are understanding the assigned texts. On a rotating basis, each
seminar participant will be asked to organize and lead discussion of readings.

2\. Out of Class Assignments: In addition to the readings, there will be
several out of class assignments that will be related to class discussion.
Seminar participants will also be encouraged to attend exhibitions and other
events whose content will compliment the seminar.

3\. Project/Paper: Drawing upon the primary sources of the readings, class
presentations and discussions, and various class and out of class assignments,
everyone in the seminar will develop, research, prepare and present a final
seminar project or paper.  These projects and papers will be presented as part
of the seminar(see calendar).

All papers and projects will be due May 11

**Paper:**  
A research paper to be developed out of course content.   The paper is to be
based on library research and critical readings and should explore the issue
of identity in terms of writers, artists, film or video makers discussed in
class.  
_Paper possibilities:_  
1\. Discuss how several films depict/represent race. You can choose from films
discussed in class or in the readings.  
2\. Compare how women are represented in contemporary film from 1970's to
1990's.  
3\. Compare a novel written by a woman to its film version (for example,  "The
Talented Mr.Ripley")  
4\. Do women artists of color understand and visualize their identities in the
same way as white women? Develop through discussion of film, art or
literature.  
5\. Has the internet changed our understanding or notion of identity? (Develop
using research and images or artists who deal with this topic)  
6\. Research a paper on how several artists address identity in their work.  
These are only a few examples of possible research topics.  
All papers will be at least 10-12 pages and will include end notes, a
bibliography, and xeroxed illustrations. Please consult with me before
choosing final topic. The results of your research will be presented to the
seminar at the end of the semester (see course calendar)

**Project:**

Incorporate the themes, content and discussions of the seminar into a final
project which explores the representation of identity. This project could be
an art work, a work of poetry or prose, a short video, a performance. These
will be presented in a visual format (to be discussed in class)  
_Project possibilities:_  
1\. Art works, poetry, prose, or a short video, play, or performance which
examines themes or concepts of identity as developed through class discussion.  
2\. A comparison of changing notions of masculinity and sexuality in t.v. and
advertisements,(for example, Calvin Klein)  
3\. A comparison of several contemporary films which engage issues of gender
and sexuality.  
4\. Viewing and analysis of several films on reserve in library in
construction of masculinity or femininity.  
5\. Present an analysis of contemporary songs from a range of styles exploring
identity (this could also be developed through an analysis of music videos,
song lyrics, etc.).  
6\. Present research on artists whose work is on identity.  
Each project should be accompanied by a 3-5 page essay that discusses the main
points of the project and how it relates to the issue of identity. These
projects will be presented and discussed on the final meeting day of the
seminar. This project paper will also include a brief bibliography. All
research papers will also have a display which summarizes their discoveries.

ALL SEMINAR PARTICIPANTS MUST DISCUSS THEIR SEMINAR PROJECT WITH ME  
BEFORE THEY BEGIN. ALL PROJECTS WILL BE PRESENTED IN CLASS

**GRADING:**

Grades will be based on the quality of class participation and discussion, the
written abstracts, completion of all class assignments, and the project/paper

**OUT OF CLASS ASSIGNMENTS AND EXHIBITIONS**

In addition to the exhibition "ID/Y2K" there will be other resources to

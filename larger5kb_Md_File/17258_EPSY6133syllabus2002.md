**Information About this Course**  
  
**Catalogue Description** : History and systems of psychology related to
contemporary applied psychology  
  
**Prerequisite and Support Courses** : I assume that most will have had course
work in some form of Psychology.  
  
**Basic Premise for the Development of this Course:** Students traditionally
have been trained in the repeat after me form of learning. Knowledge and facts
are acquired and regurgitated when called for by the teacher. Now we are
moving toward a new approach to learning and retraining is necessary. Students
are now being asked to perform critical thinking and to examine their own
learning processes through reflection. They are being asked to be
experimenters and to collect and process information and to draw conclusions
based on their own discourse history. They are being asked to create their own
knowledge. Advancement of students from lower level thinking to higher level
thinking is the most important issue. This means teaching them to think
differently. This is most easily done by radically restructuring the
presentation format from one of the teacher as the sage on the stage to one of
the teacher as the guide on the side. Students are asked to work in
collaborative groups on real problems. Dialogue and interaction foster the
development of evaluation, analysis and synthesis rather than memorization of
facts. (Adapted from Bull, Harrist, and Overton, 2000)  
  
**How to use this Syllabus:** **Read the whole syllabus carefully**. All of
the information needed for this course is included in the syllabus or in the
pages linked to the Blackboard course site. This includes all of the readings
for the course. Information about how to register for the course is provided
by telephone at 1-800-744-7655. This material may be read on-line or
downloaded and printed  
  
**Course Outline/Description** : We will explore the history of the field of
psychology beginning at its roots and coming forward to the modern day. The
approach taken will be historical. People have long held ideas about how we
know, perceive and feel and why we do what we do. We will examine how these
beliefs developed and how they have been integrated into what is now the
discipline of psychology. We will examine the basic theories which were
developed in philosophy which grew into psychology and we will look at the
assumptions of these theories. The assumptions will determine whether or not
we can accept the basic premises of the various systems of psychology. If
untenable assumptions are made we should avoid modern practice based on these
assumptions. The process to be developed is one of application in authentic
situations. We will trace the development of modern theory as the field of
psychology developed out of philosophy. We will look at who studies with who
and how this affected the ways in which they approached psychology and the
ways in which the branches of the field developed as a consequence.  
  
**Course Structure:** This is an on-line computer mediated learning
experience. You can logon at anytime and participate in the activities. When
you read the material please take notes on any area that you do not understand
or upon which you would like further discussion. I will provide some
discussion questions for each chapter but I will not try to cover all of the
important material with discussion questions. Respond to the questions that
you choose (following the directions on the threaded database) and to the
responses that your classmates make. If you have additional questions you can
post them for your classmates to answer in the Water Cooler. I will try to
respond to any that your classmates do not answer. I may also respond to your
responses to point out alternative interpretations or other ways in which to
view the material.  
  
**Using the Discussion Questions (Implications):** The purpose of the
discussion questions is to pull materials out of the text that might be based
on different assumptions and have differential implications for the
development of psychological systems and experimentation. When you read the
discussion question/statement it does not make any difference whether or not
you accept the underlying assumptions, other than to set a point of discourse
with others in the class (so you will know who you are arguing with or who you
are supporting). The critical issue is the implications that derive from your
acceptance or rejection of the assumptions. What does it mean if you accept an
assumption? What does it mean to other theory that might not accept the
assumption? (Here you should try to be syncretic or consistent in building
relationships rather than eclectic.) What are the implications for practice of
supporting or rejecting a statement? How does this affect/effect other
practices which you might advocate? Practice should be consistent or it will
be viewed as contradictory (hard to sell to those who are atheoretical but
practiced). You cannot believe that all theory is right, because much of it is
contradictory. Therefore, all practice cannot be right! New research is based
on old theory. Can you accept new research if it is interpreted based on
theory that is in conflict with that in which you believe? Your answer here
will determine what you can accept of the new research and theory.  

**Style/Mode of Teaching** : This is an online asynchronous computer mediated
learning experience. You can login at anytime and participate in the
activities. When you read the material please take notes on any area that you
do not understand or upon which you would like further discussion. I will
provide some discussion questions for each chapter but I will not try to cover
all of the important material with discussion questions. Respond to the
questions that you are interested in and to the responses that your classmates
make. I will respond to your responses to point out alternative
interpretations, other ways in which to view the material, to give you a pat
on the back, or just to indicate that I have read your material.

**Reading Peer Responses** : I expect that you will try to read the responses
that your peers make. The purpose for this is to show you the diversity of
responses and to help you more fully understand the content of the chapter.
The Blackboard software allows me to see which responses you have read so I
will spot check occasionally to insure that all are doing the appropriate
response reading. If I feel that you are behind in your readings I may send
you and email to stimulate further performance. Remember that without this
collaborative reading you will not gain full value from the course.

  
**Course Objectives** : The objectives of this course are:  
1\. Use primary source material to explore the antecedents of contemporary
psychology [experimental, applied, theoretical] and trace the development of
modern psychology back to these roots.  
2\. Use primary source material to explain how the historical and cultural
context in which psychological ideas developed influenced both the developers
and the ideas.  
3\. Identify and explain the influence of the historical progenitors of modern
psychological theory and practice.  
4\. Demonstrate knowledge of the methods of historical research as it relates
to explicating psychological concepts.  
5\. Explore the scientific bases for contemporary psychology.  
6\. Review the influences of psychologists/philosophers in different cultural
and temporal settings on current psychological practice.  
7\. Describe the political, societal and economic forces that influenced the
directions of western and particularly American psychology.  
8\. Describe the current trends and critical issues facing contemporary
professional psychology in terms of their historical antecedents.  
9\. Describe the various systems of contemporary psychology and explain their
antecedents.  
10\. Develop a perspective of the chronological [linear] development of
psychological thought and the various systems of psychology.  
11\. Reflect on the major controversies in the antecedents of psychological
development, e.g., mind/body, nature/nurture, etc., and the roles that these
controversies continue to play in contemporary psychology.

**Assignments**  

**Required Responses to Discussion Questions** : You must respond to four
discussion questions per week. Try to do this by Friday of the week in which
the reading is assigned. **You may respond to any question which has not been
responded to**. If they are all taken start a second round. In some cases we
will need three rounds. If your question has already been used try to take
another perspective and explore the implications. The Discussion Board with
the discussion questions is in the communication section in Blackboard.
**Clearly mark your answers in two parts: Agreement/disagreement and
Implications.**

**Responses to Others Postings** : **Respond to four questions posted by
others each week**. **These responses need to be posted by the end of the
week** ** _following_** **the assignment of the chapter**. Try to augment (not
to refute) their implications. If you disagree send a private email response
to the author, do not post it). Send a separate copy of your email to me so
that you can receive credit for your response. If as a response author you
receive a private email and you think it is worthy and contributes to the
discussion you may post it to the discussion data base. The general thought
here is that you should not say anything to a classmate in a public, and
permanent forum, which you would not like to hear about yourself. **Flaming is
strongly discouraged.** ****

**Discussion Board Products** : Discussion Board products should be posted to
the Discussion Board. Products are due on Friday so that others will have the
weekend to respond to them. Products are listed below.  
  
_Find a New Reference:_ **Each week** you will find a new link on the Internet
which relates to the history of psychology. Describe what is available at that
link so that others can determine whether or not they would like to look at it
too. Links can be to pages of links, books, essays, articles, etc., which can
help us find out what is available on the Internet for developing
understanding of the history of psychology. **[Course requirement find 8 links
which no one else has posted, write them up following the format in the Course
Documents section, and post them to the product section of the Discussion
Board, one per week.]**  
  
_Weekly Reflection:_ **Each week** I would like you to reflect on the material
you have read. Reflection is a process of thinking about one's thinking. Many
students have never had this explained to them nor have they developed the
idea on their own. But, to understand what went right or what went wrong and
why this happened, you must think about it. You are encouraged to retrace your
steps to generate new understandings and to modify conclusions about previous
events. This is a metacognitive or high order thinking activity. You will be
asked to be experimenters and to collect and process information and to draw
conclusions based on your own discourse history. You will be asked to create
your own knowledge. Reflection: '... reveal(s) to us aspects of our experience
that might have remained hidden had we no taken time to consider... Past
experiences are considered in the light of new information. Reflection allows
us to draw conclusions about our past experience and develop new insights that
we can apply to our future activities.' It is not a description of what you
have read. Write one or more paragraphs which describe your reflections and
post them to the Discussion Forum. Read the reflections posted by others and
see how they are different from yours. I will monitor your reading and will
comment if I see you falling behind. If you find them interesting and you want
to comment on them email the original reflector and share what their
reflecting made you think about. If you are unsure how to do reflections go to
[_http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/EPSY1003reading12_](http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/EPSY1003reading12)
and read how to do it.You may also be interested in the structured links at

requirement post 9 reflections to the reflection threaded database, one per
week and one for the course overall.]**  
  
**Respond to Peer Products** : In addition to posting your product you should
read and critique at least four peer products. Two of these critiques should
be done during the first five weeks of the course and the last two critiques
during the 8th week of the course. Post your critique as a response to the
product in the product section of the Discussion Board. This is your chance to
help your peers improve their products. Look at as many as you can and make
comments that will help them improve their work. In your critique point out
what you like and why you like it as well as offering suggestions for the
improvement of the product. You should read and critique at least four
products posted by a peer. Product authors may post revisions based on
comments as responses to responses at any time. **[Course requirements post 4
responses to peer products, two in the first five weeks and two in the last
three.]**  
  
**Examination:** At the request of the Counseling Psychology and the School
Psychology areas there will be a comprehensive 50 item examination in the last
week of the course. The purpose of this exam is to help you prepare for the
liscensure examination in Psychology. The questions are designed to assess
your knowledge of the content at the level of the liscensure exam. You must
pass this exam with a score of 75% to receive an  "A" in the course and a
score of 65% to get a "B".  
  
**Projects:** You may choose any of the following projects as part of your
evaluation for this course. Refer to the grading scale to determine the number
of projects you need to complete the course. Projects must be posted to the
product section of the Discussion Board as indicated in the class schedule.
Remember that anything that you create will be available not only for the
members of this class but also for future cohorts of students. This means that
your work with your name on it will be available on the Internet for a n umber
of years. I expect that you will produce products with an appropriate level of
quality.  
  
_Concept Development_ : Trace the development of a psychological concept from
its roots to the present day. Note that tracing the history of a concept is
different than tracing its etymology. Consider the modern concept of
personality. In early writings personality might be referred to as self or as
temperament. Therefore a paper tracing this concept would integrate
information regarding all three words. Your paper should trace the historical
development of the concept to date and should indicate any changes that have
taken place in the concept as it has developed. You should identify the
researchers who contributed to the development of the concept and the data or
research that they provided. No more than ten single spaced pages.  
  
_Individual Psychologist's Theory Development_ : Pick an aspect of a person's
career, e.g., reinforcement [or the law of effect] in the work of Thorndike
and trace its development in the literature as written by that individual. All
reading must be primary material. No more than ten single spaced pages.  
  
_Review a Classical Text:_ Write a review of one of the classical texts in
psychology or one of the philosophical text with foreshadowed the development
of psychology. No more than ten single spaced pages. Many classical texts are
listed at _<http://classics.mit.edu/>___ .  
  
_Describe a Psychological System_ : Describe a system of psychology and
identify its antecedents. No more than ten single spaced pages.  
  
_Develop a Webpage_ : Develop a webpage on a history and systems topic of your
choice. This project would put together the resources which are available on
the Internet to support the understanding of a particular idea, concept,
system, person, etc., related to the chosen topic.  
  
_Develop a Personal Cognitive Autobiography:_ Develop a personal cognitive
autobiography. The goals is for you to understand the influences on your own
cognitive development. That is, to look at those who have influenced your own
thinking and ideas. Describe how your perception of psychology has developed.
Write a one page addendum to your autobiography describing the person who most
influenced your development. (Only one of these may be done.) No more than ten
single spaced pages.  
  
_Compare the Classics_ : Develop a compare the classics paper. Think about the
changes in psychology as you reflect on and write about the same topic as it
is dealt with by three different authors. Select an area of interest, find
three different authors who have written about it and discuss the differences
and the similarities in there treatment of the issue. No articles after 1925.
No more than ten single spaced pages.  
  
**Writing Style for Projects:** Follow APA style, use the 5th edition of the
APA Style Manual.  
  
**Discussion Board Product Requirements**

  * Course requirement respond to 28 questions in the Discussion Board, four per week in weeks 1-7.
  * Course requirement respond to 28 peer answers in the Discussion Board, four per week in weeks 1-7.
  * Course requirement find eight links which no one else [including me] has posted and post them to the new links section of the Discussion Board.
  * Course requirement post eight reflections to the reflection section of the Discussion Board.
  * Course requirement post at least four responses to peer products, one in the first five weeks and three in the last three weeks.

**Grading Requirements**  
A = All Discussion Board product requirements, score 75% on the examination,
and complete plus three projects  
B = All Discussion Board product requirements, score 65% on the examination,

C = All Discussion Board product requirements complete plus one projects  
  
**Completed Assignment Table**  
  
At the end of the semester please send me a table showing your completed
assignments after  
you have finished your work in this course. This will help me track your work
and assign grades for the class. (I will also do a search by each student's
name. The search will list all of the links to the assignments you have posted
on Blackboard for the semester and I can check the list against what you turn
into me for accuracy.) A format for the assignment table is located at
_<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/EPSY5103checklist>_ I am not
concerned that you use this specific format as long as you supply me with this
information in some easy-to-read format. The basic idea is this: I suggest
that you create a table with columns with the headings corresponding to the
assignments in the course and other pertinent information: Week, Date
Completed, Reading Assignment, Discussion Questions, Response to peers, Links,
Products, etc. Then list the appropriate information regarding your completed
assignments in those columns.  
  
**Policy on Incomplete Grades** : University policy will be followed.
Incomplete grades can only be given if 70% of the course products have been
completed prior to the end of the grading period.  
  
**Instructor Expectations** : I expect that you will develop products that
will be useful to you and to future cohorts of students. Your name will be on
these products and many of them will be available on the Internet on a more or
less permanent basis. I expect you to be proud of what you develop. If your
peers identify improvements your should revise your products. I expect that if
there are flaws or if new approaches develop that you will update your
material. You and your products will represent our group and Oklahoma State
University, do us proud.

**General Course Information**  
  
**Attendance Policy:** You will be expected to logon to Blackboard at
<http://blackboard.okstate.edu> **at least four times a week**. **** To help
your colleagues it will be beneficial if you post your question responses in
the Discussion Board early in the week, and by Friday at the latest, so that
they will have responses to comment on. Late responses are not useful as few
will go back and read them, they will however be marked  "new" so they will be
easy to pick out. For each week missed, after the first week, if this unlikely
event occurs, an additional performance product will be required to receive
the maximum grade. Please note that assignments may be posted in advance if
you know you are going to have time difficulties.  
  
**Add/drop Policy:** University policy will be followed see rules at

**CML Course Information**  
  
**How to Use the Internet to take this Course** : All of the materials needed
to take this course are available electronically, with the exception of the
two textbooks. There are no scheduled class meetings.  
  
**Hardware/Software Requirements:** You should have at least a Pentium 1
computer with a 28.8bps modem. The more powerful the computer the more easily
the materials will download.  
  
**Directions for Email** : If you do not have email at home use the CIS email.
Directions for obtaining email are found at
_<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/newzmail>_ .  
When you use email, always use the return receipt requested feature. This will
show you that your message was received even if the person you sent it to is
too busy to reply immediately. If you send me a question, and several ask
similar questions I may respond using the What's New Page.  
  
**Help Desk:**

For general computer, connectivity, or username/password problems, please
contact the Computing and Information Services (CIS) Help Desk by calling
405-744-7836 Monday through Friday from 7:00 a.m. to 10:00 p.m. or you can
email them at [_helpdesk@okstate.edu_](mailto:helpdesk@okstate.edu). You may
find many of the answers you need if you visit the pages at
[_http://fp.okstate.edu/bbstudents_](http://fp.okstate.edu/bbstudents) which
is a site that can help you with the username/password dilemmas that many
students struggle with. At this time (summer 2002), the Help Desk does not
answer Blackboard questions ( those that occur __after__ you have logged in
successfully ); however, they are who you call if you still have problems with
the log in process.

**Blackboard Help for Students:**

You will find the answers to most of your Blackboard questions addressed in
the Blackboard help pages for students. You will find these pages at
[_http://fp.okstate.edu/bbstudents_](http://fp.okstate.edu/bbstudents). There
you will find information on making sure your computer, modem, non-OSU email
account is set up correctly as well as find out how to get into the OSU
Library research databases from an off-campus computer. If you still are
having a problem understanding something and have checked it out as best you
can at this site, then please contact  Teresa Duston (405-744-7248,
[_duston@okstate.edu_](mailto:duston@okstate.edu) , or in-person at 422
Classroom Building) or Bill Elliott (405-744-6757,

in the evenings if they are online.  
  
**Hyperlinks in Text to other Locations on the Internet** : Hyperlinks are
underlined words or phrases in the text. Left clicking on an underlined word
will take you to an explanation or further information. A blue URL will take
you to a site on the Internet. Throughout the syllabus and the modules there
are links which will take you to other locations locally or on the Internet.
Bookmark any you wish to return to. If you are exploring you should always
bookmark your starting location so that you can return to where you started.  
  
**Reviewing Web-Based Materials** : Web materials are not reviewed and
therefore you must self-evaluate any materials you download. Some questions to
ask yourself: Can you identify the author? Is the author affiliated with an
institution of higher education? Has the author published other information on
similar topics in refereed journals? Is the material in an on-line journal? If
the material is in an on-line journal, does it have and editorial board that
reviews articles before publication? Materials from the Web are likely to seem
the most relevant, most immediate, most accessible to students, and the most
up to date. The importance and relevance of Web resources varies widely with
students and disciplines. The more of these questions you can answer the more
likely the material will be valid and research based.  
  
**Using Blackboard** : Information about using Blackboard is provided in a

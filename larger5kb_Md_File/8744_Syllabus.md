Course Policy  
This is a web enhanced course. The students success in this course is
dependent on regular reading of material and completion of assignments. The
lecture/discussion portion of this course will support the assignments.
Therefore **ALL assignments must be complete and turned in prior to lecture
for credit**. Any late assignment will be given a zero. See grading for
points. Makeup Test: There will be no make-up exams.  
  
Attendance Professional behavior requires the attendance and participation in
all class and clinic sessions. By enrolling in this program you have indicated
a commitment to practice professional behavior. This behavior requires that
you meet your commitments. If you are unable to attend either a clinic or
classroom session, you must notify Denise Helm before the session. Submit a
written explanation the day you return. All work must be made up within a week
of absence. It is the student's responsibility to make these arrangements
through the professor. If the student misses an assignment, quiz, or exam
without notifying the instructor before the absence, the student will not be
allowed to make it up.  
  
  
Ethics, Plagiarism and Cheating Personal and professional ethics are expected
to be of the highest quality as defined in the NAU-DH Policy and Procedure
Manual and the NAU Student Handbook. Any breach of ethics, e.g..: Cheating,
plagiarism, fabrication, providing false information, forgery, altering
documents, helping others with such activities are violations of the code of
conduct and will result in a grade of **F** for the activity (exam, etc.) and
is subject to further Departmental, and/or University proceedings.

PREREQUISITE_ :** One prior course in Philosophy. If you do not satisfy that
prerequisite, but still want to take this course, consult with me asap.

**_

AIMS OF COURSE**_ : Welcome to Philosophy Boot Camp. This is a extremely
writing intensive course designed to teach to write in a crisp analytical
fashion. The substance topic of the course concerns three central and
interrelated issues about human existence: the problem of free will, the mind-
body problem, and the nature of personal identity. Besides teaching to write
like philosophers, a second aim is to acquaint the student with the way the
discussion of these perennial philosophical has gone in relatively recent
philosophical literature in the so-called analytic or Anglo American
tradition. A third aim is to help students develop skill at reading,
analyzing, and understanding philosophical arguments.

**_

FORMAT OF COURSE_ : **Regular class sessions will involve an informal lecture,
with relatively limited opportunity for in class discussion. There will also
be weekly discussion sections, conducted by the TA's. Active participation in
your discussion section is essential if you are to master the materials and
analytical tools presented in this class. Your level of participation will be
taken into account in determining your final grade. For example, if you grade
is hovering on the cusp between a B+ and an A-, active participation will
enable you to fall on the A- side of that cusp. Failure to participate will
land you on the other side of that cusp.

**

COURSE REQUIREMENTS:** Each student will write **three papers** and **two
midterm exams** \- one take home, one in class. For the in class midterm,
study questions -- from which the essay questions on the midterm will be drawn
-- will be distributed one class in advance.

**_

PAPERS_ : **Each paper will should be about 1000 - 1500 words long. Although
you will write **_two versions**_ of each paper, and although **_both versions
will be graded**_ you will receive **_one overall grade**_ for each paper. The
first version shall be a **_complete draft**_. Your TA will comment on it and
return it to you. The second version will be a **_final draft_. ** Final
drafts are to incorporate changes made in response to comments by your TA, as
well as improvements prompted by your own further reflection. **_You are to
turn in the initial version again when you have completed the final
version.**_ Your overall grade for the two versions will be a weighted sum of
the grades for each version, with the final version weighted 2/3 and the
initial version weighted 1/3 of the overall grade.

**_

PEER REVIEWS_ : **For the third paper, each student will submit his/her
initial draft to another student for **_peer review**_ . A Peer Reviewer shall
read and comment upon the target paper. Commentaries shall be written and
submitted both to the author and to the TA. Peer reviews should be about one
page long. Every student will serve as a peer reviewer. The thoughtfulness of
your peer review will be a factor in determining your final grade.

**

TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE.** Marginally late (2 days or fewer) will be marked
down a full letter grade for each day. Very late papers (more than 2 days
late) will **NOT** be accepted. **NO** **INCOMPLETES** will be given in this
course, except in case of **_EXTREME**_ and **_UNFORSEEABLE**_ circumstances.

**_

EXAMS_ :** The take home Exam will be open-book, open note. For the in class
exam, study questions -- from which the questions on the exam will be drawn --
will be distributed one class in advance of the exam. These exams are designed
to hold you responsible for doing **ALL** of the assigned reading. They will
test your basic understanding of the materials read. **LATE EXAMS WILL
ABSOLUTELY NOT BE ACCEPTED.

GRADES: **Each paper will count for 25% of the grade; each exam will count for
10% of the grade; 5% of the grade will be determined by the level and quality
of your participation in discussion sections, by the thoughtfulness of your
peer review, and by the degree to which your show improvement over the course
of the quarter.

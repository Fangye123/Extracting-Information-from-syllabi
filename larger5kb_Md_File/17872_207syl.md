Course Requirements:**_

Above all, keep up with the reading and bring the relevant texts to class with
you. Active participation in class discussions and contributions to the class
listserver will add luster to your grade. Repeated unexplained absences will
lower your grade and in extreme cases may result in failure for the course.

**_

Class Listserver:**_

Everyone in the class will be automatically subscribed to the class
listserver, the aim of which is to provide an informal forum for the exchange
of ideas, questions, suggestions, etc. You will be required to post an
"electronic journal entry" (EJ) for almost every work we read, twelve over the
course of the semester. For the first six, I will provide questions and
prompts for you to respond to. For the last six, you will propose questions
and topics. Journal posts are due by midnight on the day before the relevant
class: midnight on Sunday or midnight on Wednesday. In your post you may
articulate your own position or you may comment on--develop, take issue with,
raise more questions about--someone else's.

**_

Writing:**_

Two 6-8 page papers on assigned topics are due as indicated on the syllabus.
Papers should be neatly typed on standard weight paper, DOUBLE SPACED (not 1
&frac12; or triple spaced), with 1-inch margins all the way around, and
proofread before you hand them in. Extensions will be granted only in the case
of genuine medical or personal emergency (computer problems do not qualify, so
plan ahead).

**_

Writing Workshop:**_

This is a valuable resource to help you improve your writing, whether you are
a good writer or a struggling one. Writing tutors are trained to help you
present your ideas effectively and clearly, sometimes even to help you figure
out what it is you are trying to say. The Workshop will be most useful if you
go with a draft, or at least a first page, of the paper you are working on.
You will be given a form to attach to your paper indicating which tutor you
consulted with, and academic honesty requires you to use that form. Do not
worry that this will make a bad impression on your instructor. The fact that
you have put extra time and thought into your paper always makes a good
impression. Statistically, the most frequent users of the Workshop are the
tutors themselves--because they know from experience how helpful another
reader can be.

**_

Honor Code:**_

All work in this course is governed by the Student Honor Code as described in
the _Student Handbook_ and _Williams College Bulletin_. None of the
assignments requires consulting critical works: the goal is to develop and
articulate your own ideas about literature. You should not read the written
work of another student before you hand in your own work, but you are more
than welcome to discuss the works we read with other members of the class-just
be sure to acknowledge any ideas you receive from such conversations. For
example, "A conversation with Peter Brown made me realize X or Y or Z." Then
go on to develop or complicate that realization in some way that is your own.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask.

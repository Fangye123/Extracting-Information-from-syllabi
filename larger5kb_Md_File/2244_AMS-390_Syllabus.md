> This graduate seminar will explore the study of American foreign relations
from an interdisciplinary perspective. We will analyze how a range of
Americans-with varying degrees of involvement with actual diplomatic
initiatives-have affected and represented the course of American foreign
relations. We will start our exploration at the dawn of "America's Century"
and throughout, we will examine the dialectical relationship between foreign
relations and domestic culture. Over the past hundred years, how have race,
gender, sexuality, class and consumerism, among other factors, influenced
popular representations of the American empire? Moreover, how does the
inclusion of empire into our scholarly apparatuses affect the ways that we
"do" American Studies?

>

> **Class Format:  
>  ** After eleven weeks of reading and discussion, the class will adjourn so
that students can work on their longer papers. We will reconvene for the last
week of the semester so that everyone can read (and critique) each other's
papers.

>

> **Requirements:  
>  ** Students will be required to serve as discussion leaders, participate
actively in class activities, and will be responsible for two writing
assignments: 1) weekly one-to-two page abstracts of the week's reading (book
or article), or, three to four study questions related to the reading(s)-due
each Monday afternoon in my mailbox, or by email, before 4:00 PM 2) an
original scholarly research paper (twenty to twenty-five pages), based largely
on primary source materials, which explores some aspect of American foreign
relations history from an interdisciplinary, popular cultural perspective;
OPTION for longer paper: an extended, article-length review essay
(approximately twenty pages) on a broader topic. Examples of such an approach
include: gender, popular culture, and U.S. foreign relations, or globalization
and U.S. popular culture. Grades: Abstracts-nine of them (you may skip a week)
(20 %); Class participation (including discussion leading) (30%); Research
paper/Review essay (50%)

Islamic Civilization is one of the great world civilizations which dominated
much of the Southern and part of the Western Hemisphere from the 10th through
the 16th Centuries. With the rise of the Industrial age in Western Europe, and
the beginnings of colonialism, Islamic Civilization became a culture on the
defensive, as Muslims increasingly found themselves victim to creeping Western
encroachments on their culture, their territory and their economies. In the
modern period, Islam as a religion remains an important global force, as the
second largest religion, the world's fastest growing religion, and the
religion which commands the loyalties of most of Asia, Africa and the Middle
East.

This course will consider the history of Islamic Civilization from the first
stirrings of Muhammad's prophetic vision, to the modern period. We will focus
upon what it means to live as a Muslim in different historical epochs, with
special attention to women's lives. We will also spend considerable time
looking at the meanings of Islamic civilization at the advent of new frontiers
in cyberspace.

Students who take this course will obtain the tools to read beyond the
headlines which often misrepresent Islam, to see Islamic Civilization from the
eyes it's most respected interpreters. Students will emerge with an
understanding of Islamic Civilization in its diverse manifestations with
respect to differences in territory, time, technology, gender, economy, class,
and politics. At the same time, this course will contribute to students'
liberal arts education by giving them the opportunity to express themselves
creatively in both written and alternative forms. This course also encourages
students to look beyond the "right" answers about Islamic Civilization, by
presenting a host of different and often equally legitimate possibilities,
letting students choose and reason through their own representations of Islam
with the help of the instructor. These more interpretive approaches to Islam
are balanced with a commitment to giving every student in this class a
conceptual vocabulary necessary for beginning to understand Islamic
civilization including familiarity with basic Arabic terminology and basic
geographic understandings of the regions of Islamic Civilization. This course
will prepare students for future more specialized courses in the history and
culture of the Middle East. Several guest lectures given by key UW faculty
members will introduce students to other professors at UW who teach Islamic
studies.

The course is a large lecture course, although the professor's lecturing style
is open and informal, with the intentions of facilitating interactive learning
in spite of the large number of students. It is expected that you will attend
all of the lectures and complete all of the readings before each class.
Hopefully you will come to class with several questions or issues for
discussion prepared from each day's readings, even if only for your own
edification. All course work including homework assignments, quizzes, the
midterm exam, and the final project are due on the designated date (see
important dates section below) IN CLASS. Make-up quizzes are not available.
Homework and the final project if turned in late will receive at most, half
credit.

The professor is accessible by email each day during mornings and evenings. If
you are having a problem in the course, or you want to communicate comments to
the professor outside of class or office hours then please make liberal use of
email. Also, if you have questions that don't get answered in class, then
email is a logical place to pose them. If you need a copy of the syllabus I
can send it to you by email.

If you know in advanced that you will miss a quiz or a home work assignments
for a valid reason, cleared with the professor, then some other arrangement
for receiving credit can be worked out in advance. Note that this is only a
possibility at least a week in advanced of a quiz or homework assignment, and
is not an option for the midterm or the final project.

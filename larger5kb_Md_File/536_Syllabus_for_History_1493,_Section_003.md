**Course Description** : This course provides an overview of post-Civil War
American History by focusing on general themes and patterns from
Reconstruction to the present. Our concern is not with dates and facts--though
many dates and facts are important--but with the large contours of American
history. In the pursuit of the American past, we will try, as historian David
Noble put it, "To demystify history, to render it intelligible in human rather
than in superhuman terms, to show that history is a realm of human freedom as
well as necessity."

**Reading Requirements** : All students will need to obtain copies of the
following. The weekly reading assignments are provided at the end of the
syllabus. If you ever find the reading load onerous, bear in mind Mark Twain's
observation: "Those who don't read have no advantage over those who can't."

Mary Beth Norton, et al., _A People and a Nation_ , 6th. ed. (vol.2: since
1865)  
Anzia Yezierska, _Bread Givers: A Struggle between a Father of the Old World
and a Daughter of the New  
_ John Steinbeck, _In Dubious Battle_  
Philip Caputo, _A Rumor of War_

**Format** : This is a lecture course. Students are free to ask me questions
at any point during the lecture.

**Examinations** : There are two essay midterms and an essay final. Each is
worth 100 points. The final is not comprehensive but will cover the last one-
third of the course. The first midterm will be given on **September 21;** the
second on **October 26;** and the final is at **8:00 a.m.** on **December
14**. You will also take three short essay examinations (50 points each) that
will test your knowledge of Yezierska, Steinbeck, and Caputo. The first short
examination will be given on **September 14** (Yezierska), the second on
**October 19** (Steinbeck), and the third will be given with the final on
**December 14** (Caputo). __**** With the exception of the weeks of September
21 and October 26, a quiz will be given every week, with most falling on a
Friday. These quizzes will cover the lectures and the readings for that week.
Each is worth 20 points, and we will count your 10 highest scores for a total
of 200 points. **** No make-up quizzes will be given nor will any quizzes be
given early. ****

**Reasonable Accommodation Policy** : Any student in this course who has a
disability that may prevent him or her from fully demonstrating his or her
abilities should contact me personally as soon as possible so we can discuss
accommodations necessary to ensure full participation and facilitate your
educational opportunities.

**Attendance Policy** : It is in your best interest to attend every lecture.
Experience has demonstrated time and again that those who attend class, take
careful notes, and ask questions do far better than those who drop into class
from time to time. ****

**Grades** : The following scale will determine letter grades:

585-650 A  | 100 points: midterm 1  
---|---  
520-584 B | 100 points: midterm 2  
455-519 C | 100 points: final  
390-454 D  |

200 points: quizzes (10x20)  
  
below 390 F  | 150 points: short exams  
  
650 points total

One other point is important. From October 1 to October 26, students dropping
the course who are earning an F will receive an F on their dropslip. From
October 29 until December 7, you must petition the Dean to drop the course. If
you are earning an F in the course, you will receive an F on your drop slip.

**Reading Assignments and Examination Schedule** : The weekly reading
assignments are based on what you should have read by the date listed on the
schedule. The essay midterms and the final each cover roughly one-third of the
course material.

**11 (Thursday) -- Introduction to the Course

** This course, an advanced study primarily for English majors, will be run as
a seminar. That is, each participant will contribute materially to the work of
the classroom. The participants will be responsible for research into the
publication histories of the stories and poems we read, for presenting that
material to the class as a whole and for preparing the material for posting on
the class WEB pages. In addition, each person will undertake a research
project about Poe's life and work or about the people who influenced Poe. The
results of that research will also become subject matter for the class
proceedings. That research will also be shared with the scholarly community at
large through the class WEB pages.

There will be a mid-term examination and a final.

**16 (Tuesday) -- Poe: A Video Biography**

Poe lived in Maryland for several years as a young man. He died and was buried
in Baltimore. It was appropriate, then, for Maryland Public Television to
prepare an hour-long biography of the writer.

**18 (Thursday) -- Poe: An Outline of His Life

** Our study of Poe will take place in a chronological framework. That is, we
will consider the techniques Poe used to win readers within the context of the
order of publication of his work. A chronological outline of his life will
help set the tone for the study.

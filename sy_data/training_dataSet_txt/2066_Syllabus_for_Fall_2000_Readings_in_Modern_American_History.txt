Thinking About Your Oral Presentation

Course Description
This seminar is intended to introduce you to some of the major issues
- methodological and interpretative - in the historiography of the United
States in the twentieth century. The course is organized chronologically
and topically. The assigned readings, which offer a sampling of social,
political, cultural, and intellectual history, should familiarize you with
some of the most important recent scholarship on the various topics under
discussion. Although the reading list is inherently selective, I have tried
to ensure that diverse methodological perspectives, including gender and
class analysis, will be incorporated into each week's discussion. 
By no means are the course readings exhaustive. But, after completing
the course readings and listening to your classmates' presentations, you
should be familiar with a substantial cross-section of the historiography
of the twentieth century. Moreover, you should have a foundation upon which
to build when conducting future research or preparing for your qualifying
exams.


Assignments
1) Each student will be expected to complete the assigned weekly readings
before each class.
2) Each student will be expected to participate in and contribute to
the weekly class discussions.
3) Each student is required to deliver one 20-30 minute presentation
on a book selected from the weekly "book report" list.
4) Each student is required to write three 6-7 page essays on the three
books on which s/he delivers her/his presentations to the class. The essays
will be due the day before the class for which
the topic is assigned.  The essay should be submitted electronically
or on floppy in either WP, Word, or HTML format.
5) Each student is required to complete a 20-25 page research or historiographic
essay (on a topic approved by the instructor) due December
13.

THINKING ABOUT
YOUR ORAL PRESENTATION
Planning your oral presentation is important. You need to think about
how you will use the time you have available to present your material in
an efficient and interesting manner. You have almost unlimited opportunities
for creativity in planning your presentation - aside from meeting a few
common sense standards for decorum, you can present material in any reasonable
fashion. You may integrate any audio-visual resources that are feasible
into your presentation. (Just alert me as to your equipment requirements
before hand.) The following suggestions are intended to help you think
creatively about your presentation. 
Questions to keep in mind when planning your presentation:


Which oral presentations have I heard and liked in the past? Can I duplicate
some of the  characteristics that I liked in those presentations?
Which presentations did I dislike? How can I avoid replicating those presentations?

What are the most important themes that I want the class to remember after
listening to my    talk? Can I summarize those themes in
a few short sentences? 

How can I best organize my talk to highlight those themes? Should I organize
it  thematically? Chronologically?

Are there common themes shared by my presentation and the class readings?
How can I best draw attention to those themes?

Would visual aids add to my presentation? If yes, how can I incorporate
them into my  presentation? Remember that visual aids should be used
only if they add to the presentation; they should not "replace" it.

How can I most effectively present my material? What techniques can I use
to avoid reading the presentation? How can I maintain eye contact with
my audience? How can I deliver a structured presentation which still retains
a measure of spontaneity?

Important points to consider:


Tell your audience why the specific information you are presenting is important.
Also help the class understand the importance of your larger topic.

Do more than simply summarize your material. You should provide a concise
summary of the major points, but also concentrate on explaining the larger
significance of those points.

Strive for clarity. Your audience is likely to be more interested in the
important themes than in details of your topic. Your audience can ask you
for more detail after your presentation. So strive to present just enough
detail to prevent your presentation from being overly abstract and general
but not so much that your audience is overwhelmed by seemingly arcane information.

Make sure that you provide a clear and cogent introduction and conclusion
during your presentation. Often, the most effective introduction alerts
the audience to the largest themes and the importance of the topic under
discussion. Similarly, an effective conclusion reminds audiences of the
important themes and connects them to the themes of the day's class.

Concentrate on speaking to your audience. Think of how to hold their interest
and how to encourage questions at the end of your presentation.Practice
delivering your presentation before class. You may be surprised by how
little you can actually say in 20 minutes. Above all, make sure that you
can complete your talk in 20 minutes. An overly long presentation will
tax the attention and patience of your audience.

Your grade on your presentation will be based on the following qualities:
1) Clarity and organization -- how well organized your presentation
is. 
2) Presentation style -- how effectively you present, in an interesting
manner, your material 
3) Analytical content -- how effectively you summarize the content,
highlight the important themes, and draw attention to the larger significance
of your material.

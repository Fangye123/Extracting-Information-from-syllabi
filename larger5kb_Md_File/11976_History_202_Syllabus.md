_**Course Description**_

HIST 202 is the second half of a two-semester survey of American history.
Beginning in 1865 with the end of the Civil War, the course examines the
postwar Reconstruction era, the American settlement of the West, the impact of
industrialization and urbanization, movements for civil rights, the
development of modern American politics, and the growing involvement of the
United States in world affairs.  Together with HIST 201, the course is
intended to help students achieve the goals of a liberal education as outlined
in the university's Philosophy of General Education.  In addition to providing
a grounding in American history, the survey is also designed to strengthen
essential communication skills, promote critical thinking, and encourage
ethical reflection on the part of students.

_**Required Materials**_

Textbook: | Robert A. Divine, et al., _America, Past and Present_ , vol. 2
(New York: Longmann, 1999.)  
---|---  
  
The course textbook is required for all sections of HIST 201 and is available
at the TSU bookstore on both campuses.  Students may additionally wish to
purchase the accompanying study guide, _Studying America, Past and Present_ by
Donald L. Smith, et al., or to make use of the excellent web-based resources
available at publisher's web site:
[www.awlonline.com/divine](http://www.awlonline.com/divine).   The web site
includes online multiple-choice tests for each chapter which may prove
especially valuable in assessing comprehension of assigned readings and
preparing for exams.

Along with the course textbook, individual instructors may require the
purchase of additional materials such as biographies, monographs, or
collections of primary sources.   Students should consult the syllabus
supplement for their specific section of the course in order to determine
whether additional materials are required.

_**Course Objectives**_

The goal of HIST 202, as indicated above, is to produce students who are
informed about the essential events of their past and equipped with some of
the basic analytical skills and methods applied by historians.  The course is
intended not only to present "history" as a body of knowledge but also to
provide students with basic tools for assessing the historical claims of
others and formulating arguments of their own.

(1) | people and events of major importance in American history from 1865 to

during this period;  
(3) | laws, constitutional amendments, and court decisions of great historical
importance;  
(4) | the major political and social debates of recent American history;  
(5) | the major ethnic groups that make up the population of the United States
and the contributions of each to the development of American society;  
(6) | the changing role of the United States in international affairs.  
  
Competency Objectives:

Students completing HIST 202 should be able to:

(1) | distinguish between primary and secondary sources;  
---|---  
(2) | evaluate claims about the past critically;  
(3) | gather and assess historical evidence;

(6) | comprehend tables, graphs, and charts;  
(7) | utilize information and communication technology.  
  
_**Course Format and Reading Assignments**_

In order to survey a very large amount of material effectively, HIST 202 is
primarily designed as a lecture course.  Although organization, format, and
emphasis, will naturally vary somewhat among instructors, the order of
lectures should approximately correspond to that of the chapters in the text.
Students should prepare for class by reading assigned chapters in advance and
are encouraged to participate actively in class discussions by asking
questions and offering their own observations on the subject matter.

Students receive specific reading assignments from their individual
instructors, who are responsible for assigning reading so as to cover the
course material thoroughly and evenly.  The following reading schedule,
intended as a guide for instructors and students, suggests approximately one
chapter of textbook reading per week:

Weeks 1-5 | Reconstruction to the End of the Nineteenth Century  
---|---  
Weeks 6-10 | The Twentieth Century to the End of World War II  
Weeks 11-15 | The Cold War and the Contemporary Era  
  
_**Attendance**_

All students are expected to attend class punctually and regularly.  Students
arriving after the beginning of class may, at the instructor's discretion, be
counted absent and/or asked to remain outside the classroom until the end of
the lecture.

Excessive absence or tardiness may result in a significant reduction in a
student's grade, and instructors are under no obligation to allow make-up work
in cases of tests and assignments missed as a result of unexcused absence or
tardiness.  Students are also responsible for obtaining information presented
in class during their absence.

In the event of an illness or emergency requiring absence from class, students
should contact the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs in order
to obtain the documentation necessary to have the absence excused.
Instructors may require such documentation as a condition for allowing the
completion of missed tests or assignments.

Tennessee State University's policy on absences may be found in the Student
Handbook, Chapter VII, pp. 100-101.

_**Academic Conduct**_

Except in cases of group projects so designated by the instructor, all tests
and assignments submitted in the course must be the original work of the
student.  **In cases of plagiarism or cheating, the instructor may assign an F
on the assignment or an F in the course and is also advised to report such
cases immediately to both the Vice President for Student Affairs and the Vice
President for Academic Affairs.**

Students in HIST 202 are warned particularly against the following forms of
academic dishonesty:

(1) | copying the work of other students on tests or assignments;  
---|---  
(2) | **any copying without quotation marks** from books, newspapers,
journals, internet sources, etc.  
(3) | consultation of notes or books during in-class examinations (unless
expressly permitted by the instructor;  
(4) | attempting to discover unpublished examination questions in advance.  
  
Tennessee State University's policies on academic conduct may be found in the
Student Handbook, Chapter III, p. 18.

_**Grades**_

Grades will be determined by the instructor's evaluation of quizzes, exams,
assignments, class participation, and attendance according to the information
provided on the syllabus supplement for the specific section of the course in
which the student is enrolled.  Grades are assigned according to the following
scale:  90-100 = A; 80-89 = B; 70-79 = C; 60-69 = D; 0-59 = F.

Any appeal of an assigned grade should be made within 30 days of the end of
the semester.  Grade appeals are submitted first to the instructor and only
then, failing an agreement as to the appropriateness of the grade, within 7
days to the head of the department.

Tennessee State University's policies on the appeal of grades may be found in
the Student Handbook, Chapter X, pp. 148-149.

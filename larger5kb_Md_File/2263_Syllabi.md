> **POLS Y217: INTRODUCTION TO COMPARATIVE POLITICS**

>

>> Prof. John McCormick  
>

>>

>> **

>>

>> OVERVIEW**

>>

>> We are living in times of great political change. Sitting here in the
Midwest it is sometimes easy to forget that we are part of a global political
and economic system, which affects every one of us every day. More than ever
before, Americans need to understand politics in other countries so that we
can ensure that our leaders make informed domestic and foreign policy choices,
and so that we can each understand our place in the global system.  
>

>>

>> This course will introduce you to the world's different political systems,
and compare them with each other. By the end of the semester you should have a
good grasp of the different ways in which different societies govern
themselves, of the place of the United States in the world, and of the values
of comparison.  
>

>>

>> We will be looking at five groups of countries (liberal democracies,
communist/post-communist states, newly industrializing countries, less
developed countries, and the Islamic world) and at six case study countries:
the US, Britain, Russia, Mexico, Nigeria and Egypt. In each case we will be
focusing on how politics in these countries has evolved, how they govern
themselves, how their political institutions work, how their citizens take
part in politics, and how they deal with economic and foreign policy.  
>

>>

>> **REQUIREMENTS**

>>

>> 1) _**Readings**_ There is one required text: _Comparative Politics in
Transition_ (Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt College Publishers, 3rd edition, 2001).
Copies available in the bookstore. Please do all readings in advance of class,
and come to class ready to discuss them.

>>

>> 2) _**Exams**_. There will be three in-class, non-cumulative, closed-book
exams, based on readings, lectures, handouts and videos shown in class. Each
exam will be worth 20% of your final grade, and will consist of objective
questions and short answers. Study guides will be issued before each exam.

>>

>> 3) _**Term paper**_. See page 4 for details. Worth 20% of your final grade.

>>

>> 4) _**Pop quizzes**_. There will be several of these, each consisting of
ten questions based on material in the readings and lectures, and current
world news stories. Together they will be worth 20% of your final grade. Take
all the quizzes and a bonus of ten points will be added to your final score;
miss two or more and a penalty of ten points will be deducted.

>>

>> 5) _**Participation**_. Everyone is encouraged to take part in discussions,
and to question/ debate me and other students.

>>

>> 6) _**Attendance**_. SLA policy is that documented illness is usually the
only acceptable reason for missing class, and that instructors may impose
reduced or failing grades on students cutting class excessively (SLA Bulletin,
p. 17). I adhere to this policy, and define excessive as more than three times
in a semester.

>>

>> 7) _**Grading**_. I use the following points/letter grade system:

>>

>> A+ 95%

>>

>> A 90

>>

>> A- 86

>>

>> B+ 82

>>

>> B 78

>>

>> B- 74

>>

>> C+ 70

>>

>> C 66

>>

>> C- 62

>>

>> D+ 58

>>

>> D 54

>>

>> D- 50%  
>

>>

>> NOTE 1: You cannot pass the course without taking both exams and completing
the term paper and at least half the pop quizzes. The final course grade will
be curved to peak at about B-.  
>

>>

>> NOTE 2: The School of Liberal Arts defines a C as average.

>>

>> 8) _**Make-ups and incompletes**_. These will not be available except in
cases of (1) illness that _requires_ hospitalization on the day of the exam,
or (2) serious personal problems that can be confirmed by an authoritative
third party, You will also have to convince me that there is absolutely no
alternative, and provide me with adequate warning. My philosophy is that make-
ups and incompletes are a privilege, not a right.

>>

>> 9) _**Geographical literacy**_. This course deals with societies and
peoples on different continents, so you should be familiar with what the world
looks like. There will be exam and quiz questions related to geography.

>>

>> 10) _**Current events**_. You will need to keep up with world news. Use the
Web, CNN, national news weeklies, or big city newspapers like _The New York
Times_ , but I particularly recommend National Public Radio (WFYI FM 90) and
its weekday programs "Morning Edition" (5-9am) and "All Things Considered"
(5-7pm) - they're free. Use network TV news only as a last resort. Several Web
sites are listed on my [home page](http://php.iupui.edu/~jmccormi).

>>

>> 11) _**Cheating and plagiarism**_. The policy outlined on p. 20 of the SLA
Bulletin applies.

>>

>> 12) _**Questions**_. I will do all I can to make sure you know the
requirements for the course, but the responsibility for reading this syllabus,
and for understanding and fulfilling the requirements for the course is yours
alone. If you have any questions at all, please don't hesitate to ask.

>>

>> _**Unless you tell me otherwise, I will assume that you have read,
understood and accepted everything in this syllabus, and will hold you
explicitly and precisely to all requirements.**_

>> **TERM PAPER**

>>

>> 1) _**Pick a topic**_. Choose some aspect of government or politics in the
United States which interests you, e.g., an institution (the presidency,
Congress, interest groups), a process (voting, elections, how laws are made)
or a policy (economic, foreign, environmental). Choose another country, take
the same topic, and write a paper which compares and contrasts the topic
between the US and the other country. If you choose elections, for example,
you should describe the electoral process in both countries, assess the impact
of that process on politics and government in each country, and then draw
conclusions about the structure, significance and impact of elections in the
two countries. What does your study of elections in one tell you about their
role and significance in the other?

>>

>> 2) _**Meet with me**_. By 28 October at the latest, meet with me in my
office (during office hours, or by appointment on MW) to discuss your paper. I
would be happy to read through a draft and make comments.

>>

>> 3) _**Write the paper**_. The following are minimum requirements:

>>

>>> > \- it should be at least **seven full pages** (excluding tables,
figures, etc.), double- spaced, word-processed or typed, with no more than
one-inch margins, and a type size no greater than 12-point.

>>>>

>>>> \- it should be partly descriptive but **mainly analytical** (i.e., you
should have at least two pages of conclusions, and substantiate your
conclusions). What have you learned? What does studying one country tell you
about the other?

>>>>

>>>> \- it should be based on at least **8-10 different sources** , of at
least two different kinds (i.e., authoritative Web sites, books, authoritative
news journals, etc.). You should make clear how the sources were used through
the use of endnotes, using the textbook as your model. Provide full details of
all your sources, including author, title, publisher and date. Web sites
should include the full title and URL.

>>>>

>>>> \- it should be a **political science paper** , and politics should be
its primary focus (not education, history, economics, criminal justice, law,
etc). - you should devote **equal space** and attention to the United States
and the country with which it is being compared.

>>>>

>>>> \- you should undertake a thorough check for **grammar and spelling**.

>>

>> 4) _ **Submit the paper**_. Your paper should be in my hands by 1.10pm on
December 2\. That gives you three months. Don't even **THINK** about
submitting a paper late without substantial and documentable cause. _**Unless
pre-arranged or caused by documentable reasons, late papers will incur a
policy of zero tolerance and will incur an automatic F, which will mean an F
for the entire course.**_

**

1\. QUIZZES/ASSIGNMENTS: ** There will be periodic quizzes and assignments on
topics presented during lectures and/or from the textbooks or supplementary
readings. Students are expected to be ready to participate in class
discussions on the assigned chapters. There are no make-ups for these class
assignments. These are designed to increase class participation individually
and in groups, and to exercise your search for information which may help you
improve your analytical skills, critical thinking, and interpretation of
graphs, tables, figures, note taking, and your comprehension over the material
presented during lectures.

**

2\. PROFILE OF AMERICAN INEQUALITY: ** This assignment entails a written
report about three to four pages typed, double-spaced and a brief oral
presentation about 2-3 minutes long. The research will be on topics pertinent
to present day social systems of inequality. You may choose your own topic, or
select from the textbook. The field research material should be from original
data, thorough, contemporary, and well documented. To avoid duplication,
students will indicate their topic in a sign-up roster. The oral presentations
on the Profiles of American Inequality will be scheduled during the first half
of the semester. The written report is due: Thursday, October 26th.

**

3\. PROFILE OF GLOBAL INEQUALITY: ** This assignment is similar to the one
above except the theme is Global Inequality. It also entails a written report
about three to four pages typed, double-spaced and a brief oral presentation
about 2-3 minutes long. The research will be on topics pertinent to present
day social systems of global inequality. You may choose your own topic, or
select from the textbook. The secondary analysis versus the field research
material should be contemporary, thorough, and well documented. Students may
choose to do field research as with the assignment on American inequality if
you study some aspect of inequality in Nuevo Laredo and use original data. To
avoid duplication, students will indicate their topic in a sign-up roster. The
written report is due: Tuesday, November 21st.

**

4\. TESTS: ** There will be three tests. Tests will be over lecture notes and
chapters covered to date. A dictionary may be used during the tests. No test
grades will be dropped.

**

5\. FINAL EXAM: ** The final exam will be comprehensive. A study guide will be
provided. The last day of classes will be for review.

ATTENDANCE POLICY:

**

I will take attendance daily at the beginning of the class. Class
participation has proven to be an excellent predictor of successful completion
in all courses. You are strongly urged to attend all classes. A point will be
deducted from your final grade for each absence. A characteristic of good
employees is punctuality and dependability. Thus, I will be happy to provide
letters of reference, as needed, to those students with minimal absences.

**

TEACHING PHILOSOPHY:**

I will treat you as a responsible adult who makes choices of your own free
will. I am pleased to be a part of your college education and believe each
student has the capacity to succeed. Your individual work is an indication of
your intelligence and your discipline and commitment to your career. I will do
everything I can to share what I think will help you. Achievement and effort
are highly valued in this course.

**

NOTES:**

Late assignments will be penalized one letter grade. Students are expected to
keep track of their own grade, progress, and course requirements. Extra credit
assignments may be announced during the semester depending on the relevant
nature of community events or campus activities sponsored by the University.

The textbook provides an extensive bibliography for additional readings that
can help you with your assignments. Students are expected to supplement their
reading assignments with materials available in the Killam Library and through
the inter-library loan program. I am available to guide you in your search for
information. Every assignment is designed as a learning experience. The course
is structured to give you a variety of assignments in order to use more of
your strengths plus to work on practicing more real life problem-solving
techniques. I believe you deserve to acquire as much knowledge as you can get.
The decision to remain in the course or to drop is yours. I will not take over
your own responsibilities. I take my responsibility seriously, and I assume
you want to do the same.

**Course Content and  Expected Learning Outcomes: **This course is about the
materials and physical processes of the Earth, particularly those observed in
the southern California area. Knowledge of such topics as rock types and their
origins; natural hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and landslides; and
natural resources such as water, are important to all of us. This course
(GEOL102) is an opportunity for you to learn about the Earth, and should serve
as a firm foundation for majors in geology, anthropology, environmental
science, geography, and aspects of certain science and engineering
disciplines. This course is also valuable for future K-12 teachers, and those
preparing for careers in public policy, law, and even commercial real estate!

This course is "rich in content". What this means is that we cover a lot of
material during the semester. Yes, you will have to memorize facts on
occasion. More importantly, you will be asked to connect facts and concepts
learned in this class with facts and concepts learned in other classes, and to
place your knowledge against the backdrop of your own experiences and
interests.

By the end of the semester, we want to achieve the following major goal:

**_an increase in your knowledge of important aspects of Earth processes,
structure, and history (see lecture topic description), and a deepening of
your appreciation for the Earth as a complex and interconnected system._**

GEOL102 satisfies general education requirements in science (category B). In
keeping with the underlying principles of CSULB's general education program,
you will have many opportunities in this class for thinking, writing, and
speaking. You will also have the opportunity to use WWW (World Wide Web)
course enhancements that have been developed at CSULB, by geologists at other
universities or government laboratories, or by the publishers of your text.

**_Another important goal for this course is for you to further develop your
skills in critical thinking, writing, oral communication, quantitative
reasoning, and use of technology._**  

* * *

  
**Course Requirements and Grading Framework:** Your performance on three (3)
closed-book, closed-note, written examinations, one (1) 4-5 page paper, and
fifteen in-class written and oral participation exercises will provide the
basis for assigning your grade. Tests will usually be a combination of
multiple-choice, true-false, short answer, and essay questions. The tests will
be held on the following days/times, and will contribute to your final grade
as follows:  


  * TEST 1: 20% of grade 10/8/97
  * TEST 2: 20% of grade 11/12/97
  * PAPER: 20% of grade 11/26/97
  * FINAL EXAM (CUMULATIVE): 25% of grade 12/15/97
  * Oral/Written Participation 15% of grade - opportunities every week!

**TOTAL: 100% of grade**

Note: The material covered in exams, used as the basis for your 4-5 page
paper, and the in-class exercises will be taken from lectures, readings, and
audiovisual presentations. Consistent and alert attendance at lectures is thus
fundamental to successful completion of this course.

Proposed Grading Scale:

  * greater than 88%: A
  * between 78% and 87.9%: B
  * between 68% and 77.9%: C
  * between 58% and 67.9%: D
  * less than 57.9%: F

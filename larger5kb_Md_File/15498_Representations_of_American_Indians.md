American Indian Representation is a very complex issue that has had far
reaching effects. Where often non-indians may assume a depiction is honoring
Indians, it may end up not being the case. Where some may think an image
offensive to American Indians, the image may have been _made_ by Indians. This
neither, means the image will be held in high regard by _all_ Indians. For
example, the image above was the art work for the cover of the "Tribal Force"
comic book. This comic is the one sole example of a comic wholely generated by
Indians, with an American Indian content. Because of this, the way the comic
was conceived, produced, interpreted and understood was and is different than
if these images and the narrative of this comic were created by non-Indians.
The websites below deal with some aspect of these issues surrounding Indian
representation. Also the class schedule and syllabus for the Representations
of American Indians course I teach at U.W. is accessable from the links right
below.

These websites deal with some of the various issues surrounding
representations of American Indians.

  * *** New** [Indian Mascots Issue](http://www.main.nc.us/wncceib/IndianMascotIssue.htm) presented by the Western North Carolina Citizens For An End To Institutional Bigotry (WNCCEIB) Website. This is a very good presentation that tracks how the issue of Indians as school mascots, unfolded at Erwin High School in Buscombe, North Carolina. Includes many articles from the North Carolina newspapers, Justice Department Reports, Statements released by the Faculty and School Board, Statements by Tribal Leaders, Transcripts of CNN, and other news programs, in addition to editorials explaining the history and context of the use of Indians as mascots. I highly recommend looking over this website.

  * The Native American Navigator Project Pages is an extensive site with many subpages. It is designed primarly as a resource for k-12 teachers but much of the information is very useful for adult level learning as well. This section ["Media"](http://www.ilt.columbia.edu/k12/naha/nasub/media.html) deals with how Indians have been portrayed in the media. 

  * [Oyate](http://www.oyate.org/) is the name of the website that contains the excellent review of a book that many people in Indian Country are not happy with. It has the appearance of being a diary by a young Souix girl at Carlisle boarding school and is called "My Heart is on the Ground". The review is by Native women intellectuals, and evokes the issue of misrepresentation of Indians to children. The link is at the bottom of the opening page. This also a very good website for those of you doing research on the impact of representation in education. 

  * [ "Indians": Textualism, Morality, and the Problem of History](http://omni.cc.purdue.edu/~sbenning/el102c/Indians_Essay/Indians.html) is a very well done, scholarly article the author of which utilizes self-reflexive interrogations to the fabulation of the "Indian".

  * [4XLA is a Native American Archetechtual Design firm based in LA. Click on the "What is 4XLA?" link and find out how they perceive themselves as American Indians in the architechture discipline which is inherently visual. 

  * [Romancing the Indian](http://xroads.virginia.edu/~HYPER/HNS/Indians/main.html). A website that analyzes representations of Indians in early American literature. This is a very well done online example of scholarly work utilizing the graphic nature of the web. 

  * [Powerful Images](http://www.museumswest.org/exhibit/exhibit.htm): Portrayals of Native America is a website exhibit that "examines the ways that Native Americans have been represented both from within their own cultures and by others. The exhibition features important examples of Native art traditions, Euro-American art and popular culture. Through reinterpretation of familiar imagery, the exhibition explores common perceptions of Native American peoples and presents alternative voices. Explore the exhibit through these five sections."

  * [Native Americans in the Movies](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/IndigenousBib.html) is an online bibliography of material on Indians in Movies at the UC Berkeley Library. A good resource.

  * [Mi Vida Loca](http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/6174/lr3.htm), is a website devoted to _Love and Rockets_. Though the characters in _Love and Rockets_ are predominantly Mexican, and do not include indgenousness as a part of their identity, there are some in the "Palomar" stories who are 'Indios'. Luba is half Indian and the men who lust after her gorgeous ferocity refer to her 'La India' Luba. Another ferociously gorgeous character Tonantzin, is of Indian descent and one very important story marks some of her attempts to honor that descent. _Love and Rockets_ is the comic series that broke the barrier for comix, becoming acknowledged as "graphic sequential literature". There has been scholarly research done and academic panels held on this most sublime comic. That the creators are Mexican rather than white, as is often the case with ethnic characters, marks the unique, situated position of this comic as self representation. 

  * [An AIM webiste](http://www.dickshovel.com/AIMIntro.html). Engages many issues. Useful for those doing research on the reclaimation of Indian voice and the Red Power movement.

  * [Karen Strom's Index of Native American Art](http://www.hanksville.org/NAresources/indices/NAaexhibit.html), has many links to online exhibits. Very good resource for representation on the internet through art.

  * [Photo Collection of the take over of Alcatraz Island](http://www.csulb.edu/projects/ais/alcatraz/) by Indian sin the 1970's. This is a very good collection of photos put together by Troy Johnson, and is a fantastic resource for those doing research on the the red power movement and its representation.

  * [Timothy Truman's](http://www.comicon.com/truman/truman.htm), the creator of _Scout_ , homepage. Not a critical resource, but worth checking out of you are doing a paper or project on Indians in comics. 

  * [Pocahontas Myth](http://www.powhatan.org/pocc.html) is a good look at how the Pocahontas myth has been utilized and distorted. It is housed on the Powhaton Renape nation's website and also includes a link to their own more realistic play about Pocahontas. A narrative from a tribal member describes what ensued when they learned that a Disney movie was to be made about their tribe. He tells that they attempted to contact Disney to offer assistance, but were told their help wasn't needed, with Roy Disney apparently saying that he had the right to fictionalize any aspect in history that he wanted to. This is an example of how representation could have been a excellent middle ground between cultures, but ended up echoing colonization processes. 

  * ["The Real Pocahontas"](http://www.geocities.com/Broadway/1001/poca.html) is a website that attempts to track the historical person of Pocahontas and the myth of Pocahontas. Well done and has a lot of information. 

  * [A site about the Disney Pocahontas movie](http://indy4.fdl.cc.mn.us/~isk/poca/pocahont.html). There is a section with [Indian opinions](http://indy4.fdl.cc.mn.us/~isk/poca/pocind.html) about the Disney Pocahontas movie. 

  * [Indian Princesses and Cowgirls](http://www.peak.sfu.ca/the-peak/97-3/issue5/indians.html). An essay about the Indian Princess stereotype.

  * [Native Americans in the Movies](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/IndigenousBib.html): A Bibliography of Materials in the UC Berkeley Library. A good resource for those doing research on the topic. 

  * [A Line in the Sand](http://www.hanksville.org/sand/). This is a website dealing with cultural property that has page on stereotypes. It is well thought out and well put together. 

  * ["The Only Good Indian is a Dead Indian: History and Meaning of a Proverbial Stereotype"](http://info.utas.edu.au:80/docs/flonta/DP,1,1,95/INDIAN.html). An essay in the _Journal of International Proverb Studies_. Pretty good analysis. 

  * [ "The European's Indian"](http://karlmay.uni-bielefeld.de/kmg/sprachen/englisch/seklit/camurat/cmrt4.htm#2) is a section from Diane Camurat's 'American Indians in the Great War: Real and Imagined', an online historical book on U.S. and Indian relations. Very good consideration of European conceptions of Indians. 

  * [A Karl May](http://karlmay.uni-bielefeld.de/kmg/sprachen/englisch/index.htm) website. Includes links to one of his stories on his famous Apache hero "Winnetou the Apache Knight". 

  * [A Fistful of Dreams](http://karlmay.uni-bielefeld.de/kmg/sprachen/englisch/seklit/langley/index.htm) is the title of a good essay about the work and impact of Karl May's stories on Europe.

    * [Haozous](http://www.allanhouser.com/). This is website devoted to the work of renowned Chiricahua artist Allen Houser, who deals with representations of Indians by doing it very well. I thought I would like to begin with a a link of a wonderful representations. 

    * **New** [John Trudell's webpage](http://www.planet-peace.org/trudell/index1.html). 
    * **New** [Rockin Warriors](http://www.lynxlux.com/warriors/index.html), is a documentary that focuses on Native American rock 'n' roll not only as an indigenous phenomenon but also as a highly popular musical form in Europe.

    * This is the website for native graphic artist [Jason Lujan](http://www.geocities.com/SouthBeach/Canal/1500/solypsist.html). 

    *   * Art and other forms that represent Indians or Indians or Indian topics, by non-Indians.

    * [Jack Levin](http://www.jacklevinart.com/) is an non-Indian artist who features Indians in his paintings. 

  
_**Links to General Sites on Representation, Images, etc...**_

These are websites that deal with representation in general, not only with
representation of Indians. Some are on the media and how to critique the
medias sue of images, some are on representation in literature. I include
these here, because they all contribute ways to think about the power of
images and representations, and provide tools to critically approach
representations.

  * [Transparency](http://www.transparencynow.com/news/tableof.htm): A Website That Tries To Make Things Clear", focuses on analysis of representation in the visual realms. Many very good critical analyses here on film, media, television. It is comprised of film, popular culture, post-modern and post-colonial theory and is a website that provides excellent media criticism approaches. Examples of sections are "Basic Principles of Media Criticism", "Power and Appearances". Definately worth some exploration time. 

  * ["Entrapped Agency:](http://shr.stanford.edu/shreview/5-Sup/text/goldman.html) an exploration of the links between cinema and fascism", by Melissa Goldman. This a very good critical article on some of the relationships between politics and image making.

  
_**Links from class discussions**_

These are websites that have come up during various class discussions. I will
add to this list as the class progresses.

  * Here are some links about the Big Mountain Controversy which came up during Tomas Shush's presentation and some students asked for info on. 
    * [S.I.S.I.S.](http://kafka.uvic.ca/~vipirg/SISIS/) website. I mentioned this site, however its focus is on Canadian land dispute issues.

    * [The Navajo-Hopi Controversy](http://indy4.fdl.cc.mn.us/~isk/maps/az/navhopi.html) is relayed very well here through Paula Giese's GIS (Geographical Information System) Map site. Unfortunately this wonderful woman who contributed so much to the development of Indian presence on the internet has passed on. The sites are not being updated in order to offer them as she last left them. 

    * [Big Mountain Web Resources](http://www.utexas.edu/students/nave/bigmtn.html) is a website put together by a student organization at U.T. Austin. Very Good.

**IMPORTANT: STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
First and foremost, _you_ must keep in touch with the instructor. You must
read the material in the book and the notes, take the tests as scheduled, and
turn in the activity assignments before the deadline. Although extensions are
sometimes granted for the activities, the instructor is under no obligation to
do so.**

**Online courses are for students who have a high level of self-
responsibility, self-direction and maturity. If you cannot make a study
schedule and keep to it, or you tend miss deadlines, perhaps an on campus
class would suit you better than on online class.**

**There is a lot of material to cover in this class, and the textbook can be
intimidating to some students. Don't let that discourage you, as most students
find that the course is not as difficult as it first appears. Another
instructor suggests that students view the textbook as an "encyclopedia" used
to illuminate the classroom lectures or online notes. We will put a bit more
emphasis on the textbook in this class, but keep in mind that you will be
responsible for the most important material, not the minute detail. Virtually
any student who puts forth a genuine effort can at least pass the course.
Typically, those who receive "F'" are those who just give up. If you have
gotten this far in life, you have what it takes to do well in this
introductory class. All it takes is a little determination and effort on your
part.**

**However, if you fall behind or suffer some unexpected illness or emergency,
it is _your_ responsibility to seek help and/or withdraw officially from the
class, or consider your other options. (Note: I cannot withdraw you -- you
must do that through the school. So please deal with that directly through the
school. ) Since all tests, except the final, are available for a period of
days to fit the schedules of online students, no make-ups will be scheduled.**

**FIRST ASSIGNMENT: Your first assignment is to read the chapters in the book
and the online notes, as indicated in the[schedule ](../ast102/schedule.htm),
and to fill out the [Agreement Form](../ast102/agreement.htm).**

**COURSE DESCRIPTION: A survey course concerning the history of astronomy, the
tools of the astronomer and the contents of the solar system. This class
includes laboratory experience, which will be completed individually rather
than in a lab.**

**REQUIRED MATERIALS& ATTENDANCE: Which book you use depends on which school
you are taking this course through: **

  * **For CCA (Community College of Aurora), the text is[ _ _The Cosmic Perspective__ ](http://www.aw.com/product/0,2627,0805380418,00.html)_Full Edition_ by Bennett et al, Addison Wesley, 2002. **
  * **For CCD (Community College of Denver), the text is _[ _The Cosmic Perspective_](http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/bennett_awl/), Brief Edition _ by Bennett et al, Addison Wesley, 2000. **

**Other reading suggestions _may_ be made from time to time, but this is the
only required text. I strongly suggest that you use a highlighter to emphasize
important material. _Access to a pair of binoculars or a small telescope will
be helpful, but not essential._**

**ON-CAMPUS ATTENDANCE: You will be required to be on-campus only once or
twice for this class, for the final and in some semesters for a midterm test.
Consult the schedule for the times and directions for your midterm test or
paper, and where and when to take and final. Note that the four or five tests
will be online, and accessible over a period of several days. We will make
every effort to resolve any scheduling conflicts so that these requirements do
not pose a problem.**

**METHOD OF ACCESS AND INSTRUCTION: Each student must access course materials,
other than the required book assignments via the World Wide Web.**

    **For CCA, the URL is<http://cs.cca.cccoes.edu/astro/ast101/ast101.htm>**
    **For CCD, the URL is[http://ccdweb.ccd.cccoes.edu/ast101/CCD/ ](http://ccdweb.ccd.cccoes.edu/ast101/CCD/)**

**Access can be from an on-campus computer or home-computer. If you do not
have personal access to the World Wide Web (WWW) from home, you _may_ be able
to access it from the public library. _A reliable link to the Internet is
absolutely essential for this course_. The WWW site contains an e-mail link to
send messages and assignments to your instructor.  If, during the course of
the semester, for if you do not receive an email of some sort from your
instructor for a week or more, something may be wrong. In such an event you
MUST contact your instructor immediately. Otherwise you may miss important
information or changes of schedule. this is YOUR duty, not your instructor's.
You may also reach your instructor at any time at (303) 691-2172 (home number,
call only if it is really important!) (home), or with the e-mail address:
[_Starman@usa.net._](mailto:Starman@usa.net)**

**COURSE OUTLINE:** This course will cover from the beginning of the book
through the chapter(s) about the Sun.

  * **For CCA, we will cover chapters 1-14 (approximately)**
  * **For CCD, we will cover chapters 1-12 (approximately)**

**_The exact schedule of textbook readings is in your
online[Schedule](schedule.htm)._**

**The course includes the history of astronomy; motions in the heavens;
scientific "laws," methods and instruments of astronomy; the Earth, Moon and
planets; planetary rings and moons; comets, meteors and asteroids; the
formation of the solar system; and the Sun -- its nature, energy and relation
to other stars. The exact order and schedule will be posted by the official
beginning of the semester.**

**One or more sets of class notes corresponding to the required reading
assignment will be posted on the WWW site, along with other illustrative
material, appropriate links to other Internet sites, and other useful study
material. (Actually, all of the notes may be posted at the beginning of the
course, but not all may be completely updated until the week for which they
are intended.) The notes are intended to illuminate the reading material, and
in many cases to provide background or otherwise interesting material in
addition to the reading. In addition to the readings, there will be 8 or more
project assignments, some of which will require students to make some simple
outdoor observations. Some projects can be done on the computer, or printed
out and completed in a traditional manner. None requires any special equipment
or knowledge. Optional opportunities for outdoor observation through a
telescope with the instructor will be announced. Most if not all of the
project assignments will be listed on the WWW site.**

**_Astronomy on the Internet_ is similar to a self-paced course in that you do
not attend weekly classes, but do set your own study time, and perform some of
the laboratory assignments on your own. This type of arrangement works best
for those who can set and follow a good work schedule, and who can study well
alone. __Being able to set your own hours emphatically does not mean that you
can squeeze in your study time whenever you get around to it. Students must
set a definite study time and stick to it_. _ Students are not alone in this
course, and can contact the instructor with questions and concerns at any
time. However, if you are not a self-motivator, Internet courses may not be
for you.**

**GRADING: Contact the instructor if you have a question on the _weighting_ of
individual items. Your final grade will be based on your total percentage
scores on tests, assignments and the final, according to the following
percentages:**

**4 tests** | **40%**  
---|---  
**1 Midterm (not this summer!)  ** | **0%**  
**1 Final (on campus)** | **35%**  
**5 Activities** | **25%**  
|  
**_TOTAL:_** | **_100%_**  
_(Note: The final is closed book and closed notes)_  
  
**The 4 tests usually have 25-30 points each, but the aggregate total of all
online tests is 40 percent. Each activity is graded on a basis of 10 points,
but all the activities together count as 20 percent of your grade. Thus a
"point" on an online test does not count the same percentage as a "point" on
an activity. The bottom line here is that you cannot simply add together all
the "points" you receive to find your grade. When I provide grade reports, I
will give you the percentages you receive as well.**

**GRADES: Please note that the following grading scheme may be different from
your other classes. For instance 90 percent is not an A, but a B.  **

**_Percentage Grades_**

**100-91 %** | **A**  
---|---  
**90-81 %** | **B**  
**80-71 %** | **C**  
**70-61 %** | **D**  
**60-0** | **F**  
  
**MAKE-UPS: Since this is a course without specific class periods, make-ups
should not be necessary. _Students are given several days in which to complete
tests, so make-ups should not be necessary. (Don't wait until the last
minute!) Assignments and "tests" must be received by posted deadlines for the
given semester. _I will consider make-ups only in the case of a legitimate,
extreme personal emergency. In such an event, it is still your responsibility
to contact me and make arrangements before the event or as soon after as
possible.**

**PREREQUISITES: There are no prerequisites for this course other than the
normal enrollment requirements for your school. This is not a mathematics-
based course, although some simple arithmetic and algebra will be used.
Whenever required, the mathematics used will be explained thoroughly. No
student should avoid this course because of the mathematics.**

**COMPLAINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: There are a wide variety of backgrounds for the
people taking this course. I will try to match the course as closely as
possible to your needs. However, this approach undoubtedly will leave some
people feeling it is too hard, and others feeling that it is too easy. If you
have such a concern, please contact me and I will be happy to work with you to
make this course fit your needs as closely as possible. Please let me know
your complaints about or suggestions for this course. If something is bugging
you, I can't correct it if I don't know about it. Also, I cannot guarantee
what you learn. I can only provide information and direction. What you learn
is up to you, but I am here to help in any way I can.**

**PROJECTS (ASSIGNMENTS): The projects or "lab" assignments in this course are
designed to allow the student to complete them independently. _No
prerequisites or knowledge of science is required and all projects are
designed such that any student -- regardless of background or preparation --
should be able to complete them successfully._ Complete instructions will be
given, which if followed exactly, will make these projects easy. Project
assignments are constantly being refined, so specific assignments may be
changed and will be listed with the posted notes with your Notes. __Please
remember that the projects (altogether) account for 20 percent of your grade
and that you may not pass if you do not do them.__ At any rate, the absolute
best you can do in this class if you fail to turn in the activities is a low
B. Here are the projects:**

| **_REQUIRED:_** | _**OPTIONAL:**_

[Activity #1 - the Sidereal Day](activity1.htm) |  
[Activity #2 - Circumference of the Earth](activity2.htm) |  
[Activity #3 - Diameter of the Sun](activity3.htm) |  
[Activity #4 - Jupiter's Satellites](activity4.htm) |  
  | [Activity #5 - The Rotation of Jupiter](activity5.htm)

  | [Activity #7 - Observatory Visit ** ** ](activity7.htm)  
  | [Activity #8 - Phases of the Moon](activity8.htm)  
  
**Activity #7 or Activity #8 may be used as extra credit only after you have
submitted activities 1-4, and activity 6. Activities #7 and #8 may also be
used as substitutes. Activity #5 has been dropped from this semester.**

**PRIVACY:While you do not have to come to an on-campus classroom for this
course, you should nevertheless make an effort to interact with other
students. With this in mind, I may distribute email addresses of all students
to all other students. Just as would be the case in a traditional classroom,
students have the right to know who the other students are and to interact
with them. I encourage this, especially on the required activities. While I
consider student contact information confidential to anyone outside the
course, I do feel that it is necessary to make it available to other
legitimate students. If you have a concern about this, you must discuss it
with me no later than the first week of class.**

**STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES: _Discrimination based on disability in admission
to, access to and the operation of programs, services, or activities of this
school is prohibited by the Americans with Disabilities Act._ We will make
every effort to provide accommodations for qualified students with
disabilities. If you need special consideration, contact your instructor, your
advisor, or other appropriate agency or department. **

**GENERAL POLICES FOR INCOMPLETES and WITHDRAWALS: Please consult the official
Schedule of Classes for withdrawal deadlines and other important dates. I have
decided that I will not automatically give Incompletes or Administrative
Withdrawals.**

**An "Incomplete" is only for students who have successfully completed 2/3rds
to 3/4ths of the course work and are unable to complete the semester due to
some unforeseen illness or extraordinary circumstance occurring after the last
date to officially withdraw from the course. While I strongly dislike granting
Incompletes, if you fit the qualifications, I will be willing to consider your
situation, but only if you contact me after the last official date to withdraw
and before the end of the semester.**

**A Withdrawal must be initiated by the student before the final deadline for
withdrawals. A student who simply stops participating in the class (or signs
up for the class but never participates) without withdrawing officially will
receive an "F" for the course.**

**If you are having a severe problem, contact me immediately. If you have a
legitimate reason (such as an accident or illness requiring hospitalization or
a death in the immediate family), I will see what I can do. Otherwise it is
your responsibility to withdraw from class before the deadline if you cannot
complete it. If you fail to withdraw by the deadline and you abandon the
course, I will not issue and Administrative Withdrawal and you will fail.
Period. (Note: I cannot and will not withdraw you \-- you must do that through
the school. So please deal with that directly through the school.) See the
Class Schedule or contact your academic advisor.**

> The Course**  
>  This course examines the participation of women in the culture of print, as
both producers and consumers, in Britain and early America. In its exploration
of this problem, it will incorporate issues such as governmental controls of
the dissemination of print; the democratization and expansion of the literary
marketplace; the meanings of literacy; gender and print; the British and
American contexts in which the literature was produced and read; and the
impact of the American Revolution upon these questions. Ultimately, the
objective is to arrive at a thesis about the evolving meanings of reading and
writing for women in both Britain and early America.

>  **Attendance**  
>  Attendance is essential: both your grade (and your colleagues) will benefit
from your presence in class and the informed contributions that follow
diligent attention to the readings. Since class discussion will revolve around
our readings, make sure you bring your documents (your evidentiary base) to
class to support your arguments. Class participation is heavily weighted;
quality rather than quantity is the criterion for grading.  
>  
>  **Writing**  
>  This class is writing-emiched, therefore two essays (three and ten-twelve
pages in length, respectively) and a final examination are required. Papers
are due in class on 19 February and 30 April. (N.B. All quotations,
paraphrases, and ideas which are not your own should be properly cited in
footnotes or endnotes. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism and constitutes
grounds for failing the entire course.) Late papers will suffer a reduction of
a third of a letter grade per calendar day (including weekends).  
>  **  
> Examination**  
>  There will be a take-home final examination that will be distributed on the
last day of class. All examinations must be returned to me (or to the history
department office) no later than 3 pm, 11 May 2001. I will not accept late
exams or email submissions. Failure to submit the examination will result in a
failure for the course.  
>  Failure to complete all course work will result in a final grade of  "F, "
regardless of grades received on any completed work.  
>  **  
> Evaluation**  
>  My evaluation of your performance will be based upon your class
participation and your written work. The course requirements are weighted as
shown below, but I will emphasize improvement over the course of the semester;
your final grade can, in fact, be higher than the average of your scores. (It
cannot be lower.)

>  ** The first writing assignment will treat theoretical questions of gender
and literacy. Revised as necessary, the first assignment would be ready to be
incorporated into the final paper. The ultimate writing goal of the class is
to produce a ten-to-twelve-page analytical paper in which the student advances
a thesis regarding women and print in early America. This second essay must be
based on primary sources of the student's choice (poetry, letters, diary,
captivity narrative, memoir, or novel, selected from Sharon Harris's American
Women Writers to 1800), set in its historical context, and must deal
specifically with issues of gender, literacy, and authority. The advance
preparation for the final paper, in particular the annotated bibliography and
outline, will also be graded.

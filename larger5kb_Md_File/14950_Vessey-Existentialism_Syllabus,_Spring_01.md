Paper #3 Due: Final Exam Time



Requirements:

This is a writing intensive course.

1\. There are 11 assigned Discussion Papers (due more or less every Monday
discussion session). These papers are to be 2 pages typed, Times/New Roman
(unless otherwise noted). All typo grading policies apply (lose one grade for
every four typos; a typo includes spelling or grammatical errors,
inappropriate use of gendered pronouns, and/or failure to properly cite
quotations). These papers will be graded A, B, C, F and the bottom three
grades will be ignored. Effectively, then, you can skip three of these
discussion papers. Since they are purely for the sake of facilitating
discussion, there is no point in turning them in after the discussion.

2\. These are three "long" papers, 5-7 pages typed, on a topic of your choice
(see the suggested list below). You will pick one topic at the beginning of
the semester and write all three papers on the topic. The first paper will be
an exposition (plus two or three critical queries) of a 19th century figure
(Kierkegaard, Emerson, or Nietzsche) on your topic. The second will be an
exposition (plus two or three critical queries) of a 20th century figure
(Heidegger, Sartre, deBeauvoir, Camus, or others) on your topic. The first two
long papers are due on a Friday, though they will be accepted until the next
Monday without penalty. They will not be accepted after Monday. Everyone will
read, comment on and grade five other papers and these responses/grades are
due in class on the following Friday. The grades, papers and comments will be
discussed in class. The grade on the paper will be a combination of the
students' grades and my grade. The third paper will combine the first two into
a comparison/contrast paper in which you analyze the differences, strengths
and weakness of each philosopher's view and then develop your own critical
alternative. It will include rewrites of the first two papers based on earlier
feedback and the context of the longer paper. Since this third paper combines
the work of the other two papers (with their revisions) it will be 15-17 pages
long and will be due at the time of the final exam.



There will be no exams.

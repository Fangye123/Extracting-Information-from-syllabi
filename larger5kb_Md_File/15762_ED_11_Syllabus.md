**Policy Statement Regarding Late Assignments and Academic Honesty  
**_Late Assignments_  
Each assignment is to be completed and turned in during the class session on
the date that it is due. Late assignments will be reduced by 1/2 letter grade
for each school day they are late. Such assignments may not be accepted at
all, depending on the discretion of the professor.  "Assignments" include
papers, projects, presentations, demonstrations, lesson plans, journals, logs,
etc. **_To avoid a reduced grade:_** At least one day prior to original due
date speak to the professor to get permission for a later due date and set the
day and time it will be turned in. If you are away from campus on an official
college event (this includes athletes), it is your responsibility to turn in
your assignment early or send it with a classmate the day it is due in order
to receive full credit.

_Academic Honesty_  
The Education Department believes that academic honesty is a serious concern.
Acts of dishonesty include (but are not limited to) cheating, plagiarism,
forgery, and misrepresenting commitments. **Plagiarism,** defined in the
pamphlet Plagiarism and Academic Integrity at Furman University, is the
"unacknowledged use of someone else's work is in effect an attempt to deceive
one's reader into thinking it is one's own work." This includes using parts of
commercially-prepared units of instruction instead of your own. **Academic
dishonesty** includes handing in the same student product (paper, unit, lesson
plan) for credit in two different classes without the approval of both
instructors. Such acts will be grounds for appropriate disciplinary action and
will be dealt with individually. They can result in an automatic  "F" in the
course and/or expulsion from the program. The policy is consistent with the
College Academic Regulations in the Bulletin.

_Access_  
In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Furman University
provides a range of services to allow persons with special needs (including
learning disabilities such as ADHD) to participate in education programs. You
**_must_** contact the Coordinator for Disability Services, Dr. Susan Clark,
before the course instructor can address your individual needs. She can be
reached at 294-2322.

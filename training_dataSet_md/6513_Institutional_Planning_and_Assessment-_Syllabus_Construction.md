**Psychology 101** (Section 001)  
Introductory Psychology  
Dr. Lester A. Lefton

PSYCHOLOGY 101 --Introductory Psychology - 3 credits, no prerequisites. A
broad survey of psychological principles.

**_SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF COURSE_**  
This is an introductory psychology course and its goal is to introduce the
student to basic psychology. Students will be presented with material which
will give them a broad base of understanding of psychology. Both classical
research and contemporary issues will be discussed in attempting to relate
theory and research to...

**_INSTRUCTOR, OFFICE, AND OFFICE HOURS_**  
I am an experimental psychologist with special interests in perception. My
office is in Room 224 Barnwell and I will be there immediately before this
class. If you want to see me on a particular day or time, please let me know
during or immediately after class; I can then arrange a time for a conference.
My office phone is 777-4263. If you want to talk with me and have trouble
finding me, please leave your name and number with my...

**_TEXT_**  
There is one text required, available at the bookstores. Lefton, L.A. (1993)
Psychology (5th ed). Needham Heights, MA: Allyn  & Bacon, Inc.

**_COURSE GOALS_**  
The aim of the course is to expose students to the field of psychology. In
doing so, students will be presented with a diverse body of information about
the field of psychology. Being a survey course, no specific area will be
emphasized to a great extent, but, rather psychology will be presented as a
discipline...

**_INSTRUCTIONAL PROCEDURE_**  
Information is presented both in the classroom and through the text. Classroom
meetings will be in a lecture format such that the instructor will lecture on
important material to be learned. He will not make an attempt to cover all
aspects of the text. Rather, he will focus on difficult areas, particularly
interesting areas, or on topics of special interest. While the class meetings
are relatively structured lectures, there is a substantial amount of time set
aside for questions and answers. Students are encouraged to ask questions and
to interrupt the lecturer for points of information, clarification, or...

**_COURSE REQUIREMENTS_**  
Students are expected to fulfill three obligations: 1) attend class, 2) take
all exams, and 3) fulfill the Psychology Department human participant
obligation.  
**_Classroom Attendance:_** Classroom attendance is mandatory; attendance will
be taken on a semi-random schedule. In accord with University guidelines,
absences will be excused for incapacitating illness, official...  
**_Examinations:_** There will be four examinations given through the
semester. These exams will consist of approximately 60 multiple choice items
and 20 fill-in-the-blank items. Students are expected to arrive in class on
time with two No. 2 pencils. Exams and answer sheets will be provided...  
Approximately 80% of the items will come directly from the text; the remaining
items will be taken from material covered in class. Lectures will stress...  
**_Human Participant Obligation:_** All students taking Psychology 101 are
required to serve as a human participant in the Department's Human
Psychological Pool. This means that the student will volunteer, at a time to
be arranged, to participate in a psychological experiment. The exact
details...

**_GRADES_**  

There are four examinations. The lowest grade from Exams 1, 2, or 3 will be
dropped. The final exam grade (test #4) will not be dropped. Thus, your grade
will be based on the two highest grades of the first three and the final exam.
There-are three scores (2 tests, 1 final) and all count equally in determining
your final grade...  
There are no make-up exams; if you miss an exam from the first three, you will
receive a zero. If you miss an exam (from the first three) it will be
dropped...  
Grades on each test, which will have a total of 80 possible points, determined
as follows: ...  

A student's semester grade is determined by the total number of points
achieved on each of the course  
components. Thus a letter grade on any one component only shows a student his
or her relative standing in...

**_Student's Guide to the Psychology Department Human Participant Pool_**

It is conventional for Psychology departments nationwide to introduce students
to laboratory practice in Psychology by having them participate for a few
hours as participants in experiments. The experiments cover a broad range of
topics such as attitudes, mental abilities, human memory, perception, etc.
Students learn about experimentation first-hand and...

It is the official policy of the Psychology Department to require students in
certain classes to satisfy such an experimental requirement. If you have
objections to serving as an experimental participant, the research requirement
may be satisfied. . .

**_What do I do?_** This semester the requirement is to participate in five
experiments. Most of these experiments will last about one or one and one-half
hours and consist of one session. However, some experiments might be as short
as one-half hour...

**_Where do I sign up?_** You sign up for experiments at the Human Participant
Pool Bulletin Board in the second floor walkway between Barnwell and Hamilton
(opposite the elevator). Look over the sign-up sheets...

**_What happens if I sign up for an experiment and I can't make it?_** If you
sign up for an experiment and then discover that you aren't available, you
must let the experimenter know. If you find out at least a day ahead of time
that you cannot make it, simply cross out your...

**_What happens if I miss an experiment without notifying the experimenter?_**
If you sign up for an experiment and fail to show up for it (and fail to
notify the experimenter at least an hour in advance) you may LOSE the
privilege of fulfilling your requirement through participation in experiments.
Here's how it works. After one un-notified...

**_What happens if I don't like an experiment?_** Experimenters are required
to give you a brief any time later, without penalty. . .

**_What happens when I complete an experiment?_** When you have completed an
experiment, the experimenter will give you a 3x5 card. You need to fill out
the information requested on the card (name, social...

**_What happens if I don't satisfy the experimental requirement?_** If you
finish the semester without completing the requirement, you will lose...

**_Where is the Human Participant Pool Office, and where do I receive further
information?_** If you need further information about the Human Participant
Pool you can get it at the Human Participant Pool office, which is room 457
Barnwell...

**_ALTERNATIVES TO PARTICIPATING IN EXPERIMENTS_**

The Human Participant Pool offers a written alternative for those not wishing
to participate in experimental research. This alternative is only for those
whose participation is a course requirement rather than an extra credit
exercise. The purpose of participating in experiments is to gain hands-on
experience concerning how experimental research is...

**_Here's what to do_**. Select an article from a recent issue of a psychology
journal. The article must be two pages or longer, and the journal must be one
that is located in the journal reading room, main floor of Thomas...

Copying another student's paper is also considered plagiarism. To discourage
plagiarism...

DEADLINE for submitting these paper as fulfillment of your participation
requirement is the end of the tenth week of school. No papers...

An article by **Howard Altman** in the May 1989 issue of _The Teaching
Professor_ captured the real essence of what a syllabus should do by stating:  
  
A detailed syllabus does not take 'all the spontaneity' out of teaching-
instead it facilitates student success by sharing some of the secrets of
learning. When 'what the teacher wants' is shared openly with all the
students, far more will succeed in the course. By showing we are really
interested in what they are supposed to be learning, and want them to master,
more students will respond by getting involved in our courses and trying to
live up to those expectations (p. 1).

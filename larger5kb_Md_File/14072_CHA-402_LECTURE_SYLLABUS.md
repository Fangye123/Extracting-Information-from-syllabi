**The Digestive System** :  
  
Introduction  
The digestive system consists of the GI Tract, and the glands/accessory organs
which are associated with it (salivary glands, liver, gall bladder, pancreas).

GI tract:  
The GI tract is essentially a tube extending from the oral cavity to the anus.
From esophagus on, the GI Tract has a relatively consistent format, being
comprised of four distinct layers. For this reason we'll first describe the
general format of the tract, then look at how each region has adapted this
format to conduct specific functions.

Associated glands  
The GI tract has a number of glands associated with it. These are
predominantly (although not exclusively) exocrine secretory glands. As such,
these have a fundamentally conserved format as well. So, again we'll look
first at the format that is common to such glands in a generalized way, then
see how each organ varies from this theme.  
The liver, we'll see, varies considerably from this format, so it will be
considered separately.

  1. GI Tract: General Format  
The GI tract is a tube which, as we all learned in Sesame Street, has several
named regions (esophagus, stomach, ileum, etc.). Each region has several
functions, and the functions vary as you move down the tract. The esophagus
lubricates and conducts the food, the stomach digests, the duodenum
neutralizes the contents, and further digests, the remainder of the small
intestine digests but is heavily geared toward absorption, and the large
intestine continues the absorption and compaction.  
The GI tract also plays a major role in the immune system as well.  
Study of the GI tract is simplified some by the fact that its wall maintains a
format of four relatively discreet layers throughout. The regional changes in
function are achieved by modifications within one or more of these layers.

The four layers are: (See R&R; Fig 16.1, p441)

    1. **Mucosa:  
** The innermost layer is called the mucosa. The mucosa is, in turn,
subdivided into three layers:  

      1. **Epithelium** :   
A continuous sheet of cells whose type and specializations varies regionally
to adapt to specific functions  

      2. **Lamina propria**  
A delicate layer of **loose connective tissue** , just deep to the epithelium,
containing **small blood vessels** , the **origins of lymphatics** , and
**cells of the immune system**.  

      3. **Muscularis Mucosa**  
A light layer of smooth muscle.  

    2. **Submucosa**  

      1. CT  
A moderately dense layer of connective tissue, containing larger caliber blood
vessels and lymphatics.  

      2. Autonomic Ganglia  
Ganglia and fibers of the autonomic nervous system, which help control
peristalsis, called **Meissner's Submucosal Plexus**  

    3. **Muscularis**  
A major muscle layer, and principal mover in the peristalsis game, consisting
of:  

      1. **Muscularis Interna** : an internal layer of circularly arranged fibers, and   

      2. **Muscularis Externa** : an outer layer of longitudinally arranged fibers  

      3. Between the two is found a second series of ganglia and fibers called **Auerbach's Myenteric Plexus**.  

    4. **Serosa:**  
A layer of squamous epithelial cells and some underlying connective tissue,
which lines the peritoneal cavity. Some regions of the GI tract, such as the
small intestine, have serosa on all surfaces. Other regions, such as the upper
esophagus which is not in the peritoneal cavity, have no serosa. Still other
regions have only one surface facing the peritoneal cavity, and therefore have
a partial serosa on one surface.  

  2. The GI Tract: Region by region

    1. **Esophagus** (R &R; fig 16.2)  
The esophagus is not involved in the process of digestion/absorption, but is
simply **a conductive pathway** : it conducts the bolus of partially-chewed
food from oral cavity to stomach. The bolus is still quite coarse and
potentially damaging to the epithelium. The esophagus therefore has an
epithelium (stratified squamous) which is typical of those which must be
**resistant to abrasion** (e.g. skin, cornea, vagina) Additionally the
esophagus has glands which **lubricate** the bolus to minimize damage.  
  

      1. **Mucosa**  

        1. **Epithelium:**  
**Stratified squamous** : Esophageal epithelium is much like skin, and for the
same reasons: the bolus of food is relatively coarse, and capable of
mechanically abrading the surface.  
  
The basal layer of cells is relatively cuboidal, and linked to the underlying
Basal Lamina by hemidesmosomes. These are the mitotically competent, less
differentiated cells. Moving toward the free surface, the cells differentiate,
assembling **desmosomes,** and building **dense intermediate filament
networks**. Near the surface the cells are compacted to a squamous shape, and
very dense with filament bundles which reinforce the cell. However, unlike
skin, these surface cells generally retain their nuclei and **do not
keratinize** into lifeless squames. Defined layers include germinativum and
spinosum.  
  
Interestingly, blockage of the paracellular route is _not_ achieved through
tight junctions between these epithelial cells. Rather, paracellular movement
is blocked by the deposition of a **glycoprotein material** in the
extracellular space, thus occluding this route. This deposition occurs about
half way through the thickness of the epithelium.  
  
Langerhans cells are present, serving as antigen presenting cells, much as in
skin.  
  

        2. **Lamina Propria**  
Relatively unremarkable, and unspecialized: loose CT with collagen and
reticular fibers, small blood vessels, white blood cells. Some small mucous
glands can be found at the upper and lower ends.

        3. **Muscularis mucosa**  
Not much in the upper regions, but a definite and discreet layer, mostly
longitudinal, in the lower regions of the esophagus.  
  

      2. **Submucosa**  
Denser CT, larger blood vessels. Some **mucous secretory glands** are common
to, and characteristic of the esophageal submucosa. These are small lobules
drained by a single duct to the free surface.  
  
[The presence of these glands is one major histologic difference between
esophagus and vagina, which otherwise look similar through the microscope]  
  
A plexus of ganglia and nerves of the autonomic system is present in this
layer throughout the GI tract, called **Meissner's Submucosal Plexus.**  
  
Meissner's plexus (Meizel's lexus?) (and Auerbach's plexus which is located
between inner and outer layers of the Muscularis externa) both receive
sympathetic and parasympathetic input. The sympathetic input is from axons
whose cell bodies are located in prevertebral ganglia. These axons terminate
in the intestinal ganglia, and serve to regulate transmission there, as well
as to supply blood vessels. Sympathetic input is inhibitory to motility
(Origin of that baseball phrase: Scared hitless)  
  
Parasympathetic input is from the vagus and pelvic nerves. These terminate on
the ganglion cells of the Auerbach's and Meissner's plexuses. These ganglion
cells give rise to axons which innervate most smooth muscle in the gut, and
some secretory cells. Parasympathetic stimulation increases motility  
  
Even if the extramural input is cut, however, many of the motor and secretory
activities are retained. The ganglia and fibers act autonomously to control
motility and secretion through local feedback loops. This local system is
referred to as the enteric nervous system.  
  

      3. **Muscularis**  
Inner circular and outer longitudinal layers of muscle. In the upper 1/3 of
the esophagus the muscle is **mostly skeletal muscle** , (conferring that
exquisite control of belches acquired in pre-adolescence).  
In the lower regions both layers are smooth muscle. In the middle both types
of muscle can be found intermixed.  
Between the two layers of muscle is a second plexus of nerves and ganglia of
the autonomic system, known as **Auerbach's myenteric plexus**.  
  
Visceral smooth muscle is only intermittently innervated, relying on gap
junctions for the spread of action potentials from cell to cell, resulting in
a peristaltic wave. Distension is sufficient to stimulate initiation of
peristalsis. Circular muscle also contracts in "rhythmic segmentation mode,"
which serves more to mix than to propel food.  
  
Once stimulated by distension, the wave of peristalsis is initiated which
propels food through the tract. When this wave arrives at the esophageal
gastric junction, the tonic closure of the this junction relaxes, permitting
the bolus to enter the stomach. Failure of this sphincter leads to reflux from
the acidic stomach which can damage the esophageal epithelium. Otherwise
called heartburn.  
  

    2. Stomach  
Serious digestion gets underway in the stomach. Hydrogen ions and enzymes are
secreted, and the muscle of the stomach wall churns the contents reducing it
ultimately to a thick fluid, **chyme** (Latin for mush).  
The stomach is not tubular like the rest of the tract, but is more distended,
and bag-like. It is capable of holding the contents for an extended period,
before release to the duodenum.  
  
In the empty stomach, a rare condition among kids, the **mucosa is thrown up
into folds (rugae)** , 2-4 mm across. These permit distension upon filling,
but without a corresponding increase in lumenal pressure. (R&R; fig. 16.4)  
  
The surface of the mucosa is characterized by frequent invaginations called
**foveolae** , or **gastric pits** (G &H; graphic 14.1). At the bottom of
these pits, several tubular outpocketings arise called **gastric glands** (R
&R; fig 16.6), usually 3-7 per foveolus in the corpus. Get a good grasp of the
"surface, pit, gland" concept, since it proves difficult to see in lab, and
changes as we move further down the tract.  
The epithelium of the stomach (indeed from here to the ano-rectal junction) is
a simple columnar epithelium. However, the specific cell types which comprise
this epithelium vary considerably as you move off the "surface" into the
foveolus, then into the glands. **Tight junctions** between these cells, and
throughout the remainder of the GI tract, account for the barrier to
paracellular diffusion of lumenal contents into the lamina propria  
  

      1. Mucosa  

        1. Epithelium  
Six characterized types of epithelial cell are found in the stomach:  
  

          1. **Surface Mucous cells** :  
Found principally on the surface and in the foveolae. A terminally
differentiated columnar cell with apically placed mucous secretory granules.
Mucous is a slippery, carbohydrate- rich glycoprotein product with a major
function of lubricating and protecting the surface epithelium. These cells
also secrete HCO3-, to create an alkaline mucous blanket which protects the
cells from the harsh environment of the lumen. Cells have a life of about 4
days.  
  

          2. **Neck mucous cells** :   
Found principally in the upper regions (neck) of the gastric glands. Also a
mucous secretor, but the secretory product differs from that of the surface
mucous cell. Purpose of the difference unknown.  
  

          3. **Stem cells** :  
Usually in the middle of the gastric gland. One feature of the intestinal
lining is the relatively high turnover rate of cells, necessitating a
population of undifferentiated stem cells. Surface mucous, and mucous neck
cells are completely replaced in about 4-7 days. The stem cells give rise to
all the other epithelial cell types. There is some evidence to believe that
mucous neck cells might serve as stem cells.  
  

          4. **Parietal** (oxyntic) cells:(R &R; fig16.8)  
Found near the lower reaches of the gastric gland. Responsible for
**transporting the hydrogen ions** which acidify the stomach. Also secrete
**gastric intrinsic factor** , a glycoprotein which is essential for
absorption of vitamin B12 from the intestinal lumen. B12 is required for RBC
production, so **problems with parietal cells can lead to pernicious anemia.**  
  
This cell has an unusual morphology. The apical surface has numerous
microvilli, and some major infoldings which penetrate deep into the cell
interior (called **intracellular canaliculi** ), also rich in microvilli. This
amplified membrane area presumably is involved in the hydrogen ion transport
(H-K ATPase). The cell is **capable of internalizing and storing much of its
apical membrane upon fasting,** and returning it to the surface when acid
production is required. When internalized, this membrane is seen as a mass of
tubular structures, called the **tubulovesicular system**.  
  
The cytoplasm is dominated by **mitochondria** (about 40% of the cell volume),
which generate the ATP to power the ion pumps.  
  
H+ and HCO3- are generated from CO2 and H2O, and cytoplasmic H+ is actively
exchanged for lumenal K+ by the H+/K+ ATPase. At the basal end cytoplasmic
HCO3- is exchanged for extracellular Cl-. This bicarb is sent up the gland to
the surface where the bicarb is used to protect the surface.  
  

          5. **Chief cells (zymogen cells)** :   
Usually dominate the deepest reaches of the gastric glands. These produce
**pepsinogen** , the precursor to **pepsin.** The product is stored in large
granules in the apical cytoplasm until release is stimulated. Secretion of
pepsinogen is stimulated by stimulated by **secretin** (released from the
enteroendocrine cells, next). The inactive **pepsinogen is cleaved in the
acidic lumen to the active pepsin.**  
  

          6. **Enteroendocrine cells** :  
These are infrequent cells, scattered throughout the gastric gland (and the
rest of the intestinal epithelium). They store and release secretory granules
containing hormones which regulate GI function. However, they are not exocrine
(do not secrete into the lumen) but instead are **endocrine** (secrete into
the connective tissue space of the lamina propria) Thus these cells _are_
polarized, but in opposite orientation to the chief cells.  
  
Enteroendocrine cells are actually a heterogenous population of cells which
secrete dozens of different hormones including gastrin, serotonin,
somatostatin, enteroglucagon. There are about 3 billion cells in toto (not the
dog, but latin for "all together"). Usually it's "one cell, one product" but
some cells have been shown to secret more than one endocrine product.  
  
**Gastrin** secretion is stimulated by the presence of protein digestion
products, vagal discharge, and mechanical distension, and inhibited by acid.
Gastrin inhibits stomach emptying, and **promotes acid/pepsinogen secretion,
and promotes motility** to churn contents.  
Regional Differences in Glands  
The epithelium of the stomach varies from region to region. These differences
can be important clinically, since some pathologies tend to localize to
specific regions  
  

          * Cardiac Glands  
Predominate in the cardiac region. Largely tubular glands, dominated by mucous
cells. Enteroendocrine cells are present, and dominated by gastrin type.  
  

          * Oxyntic Glands  
Predominate in the fundus and corpus. Largely branched, with as many as 7
glands per foveolus. Contain all cell types, but they tend to be stratified
with respect to the gland, as described under individual cell types.  
  

          * Pyloric Glands  
Predominate in the pyloric region. Dominated by cells similar to the mucous
neck cells, and by large numbers of Enteroendocrine cells.  

        2. Lamina propria, muscularis mucosa, and submucosa are unremarkable in the stomach, with no noteworthy differences from the rest of the GI tract  
  

        3. muscularis mucosa: unremarkable  

      2. Muscularis  
A very thick muscularis, thought to have three layers of muscle, not two.
However, the organization is mixed, and the layers tend to merge.  
  
Some Relevant Stomach Physiology:  
The volume of the empty stomach is about 200 ml, but will distend up to about
1.5 liters before pressure begins to rise. Secretion of acid/enzymes is
basally low, but jumps dramatically upon feeding. pH can be dropped as low as
0.9, which is accomplished by exchanging lumenal K+ for cytoplasmic H+, with
the H-K ATPase exchanger. Little or no absorption of fluid is considered to
take place in the stomach, but gastric secretion totals about 2-3 liters/day.  
  

    3. Small Intestine:  
The small intestine consists of the duodenum, jejunum and ileum. The major
tasks accomplished by the small intestine are  

      * neutralize acidic chyme  

      * promote further enzymatic breakdown of chyme (with the help of pancreatic enzymes)  

      * Absorption of nutrients  

      * Recovery of water and salts  

      * Immune surveillance  

      * self replenishment  

      * endocrine control of the digestion process.   
These tasks are accomplished by specialization at several levels, from the
molecular to the gross. Further these functions change gradually as you move
through the tract.  
  
The duodenum is the principal site of acid neutralization, and is the input
site for pancreatic enzymes. The process of **absorption** of the contents now
becomes a major function. In fact, the small intestine absorbs some 8-9 liters
of fluid per day.  
  
The surface of the small intestine projects small finger-like protrusions into
the lumen called **villi**.(See G &H;, 14.1) Between villi are found finger-
like invaginations, which project into the lamina propria. These are called
**intestinal glands** , or **crypts of Lieberkuhn** , which are also lined by
the simple columnar epithelium  
  
The process of absorption is helped by several levels of modification to the
small intestine structure, all of which are aimed at increasing surface area.
The total amplification in area achieved is about 600 fold:  
  

      * **Elongation.**   
The distance from mouth to anus is less than a meter (in most folks; in some
professions this distance appears to have shortened dramatically, with a
corresponding increase in the distance between brain and mouth.) The GI tract
achieves one level of surface area amplification by elongation of the tract to
about 5 meters.  
  

      * **Plica circularis (valves of Kerkring).** (Great pic, R &R; 16.10)   
These are the crescentic folds of **_mucosa and submucosa,**_ visible to the
naked eye upon opening the intestine (10 mm high x 4 mm thick), extending half
way around the lumen. These are permanent and do not disappear with
distension. These add surface area, and also create disruption of the flow,
thereby promoting mixing.  
  

      * **Villi:  
** The entire intestinal wall is, in turn, covered by villi, finger-like
projections of _mucosa_ (not submucosa) into the lumen (approx 1 mm in
length). These occur at a frequency of about 25/mm2, and appear to the naked
eye as a sort of fuzzy or velvety surface.  
  

      * **Microvilli** :  
The absorptive cell is the predominant cell type. Its apical surface is
covered with numerous microvilli. Addition of microvilli represents the single
most effective mechanism to increase surface area, increasing the total
surface area by 30x when compared to a cell with a flat apical surface.  

      1. Mucosa  

        1. Epithelium   
Simple columnar. However, five major epithelial cell types are defined:  
  

          1. **Absorptive cells** :   
The predominant cell type in the intestinal epithelium is the absorptive cell:
a simple columnar cell. These cells have a dense mat of apical microvilli
projecting into the intestinal lumen. These microvilli are so dense, and so
uniform that they confer a fuzzy, brush-like appearance to the apical end of
the cell, earning the term **brush border** or **striated border.**  
  
Microvilli are about 1.4 long x 80 nm in diameter. There are about 3,000/cell,
and serve to amplify the surface area some 30x. They are stabilized by a
**core of actin** filaments, but are not motile. The numerous actin filaments
of the microvilli insert into a web of actin at the base of the microvilli
which is often dense enough to show up in H &E; staining. This web of actin
filaments just deep to the microvilli is called the **terminal web**.  
  
Projecting from the microvilli are the lumenal projections of integral
membrane proteins, which are heavily glycosylated. These constitute the
glycocalyx.  
The absorptive cells have a strong presence of mitochondria, ER, SER which
facilitate the numerous functions of these cells.  
  

            1. **Sodium and Water recovery**  
Total fluid input to the small intestine is about 8-9 liters /day (Ingestion=
1.5 liters/day, saliva=1.5 liters day, gastric secretion=1.0 liters/d, and
pancreatic secretion 1.5 liters/d). More than 90% of this is reabsorbed in the
small and large intestines. About 6,000 mg of sodium gets ingested daily, and
about 20-30,000 mg gets secreted by the intestinal mucosa. However, little
sodium is lost in the feces since most sodium is actively resorbed by the
intestine, powered by **sodium pumps in the basolateral surface of the
absorptive cells**. Cholera and other severe diarrhea can disrupt this
resorption, resulting in a loss of sodium which can be lethal in a matter of
hours. This active resorption draws water along with it, reducing the volume
of the lumenal contents as it progresses through the tract.  
  

            2. **Enzymatic digestion** :   
The plasma membrane of the apical end of the cell, including the microvilli
has integral membrane proteins with **proteolytic and disaccharidase
activities** (e.g.s leucine aminopeptidase, sucrase, lactase, maltase). Also
present in the apical membrane are the transporters for amino acids and sugars  
  
Projecting from the outer surface of the microvillar membrane, and visible
with the electron microscope are very fine filaments called the glycocalyx.
This is thought to serve as a protective layer for the surface cells. The
heavily glycosylated proteins bind water and create a lubricating and
protecting surface. **Pancreatic enzymes, and secreted IgA have also been
shown to adsorb to this glycocalyx.**  
  
**

            3. Lipid absorption** :  
Dietary fats are hydrolyzed to monoglycerides and free fatty acids in the
lumen. These are **kept soluble** in the lumen by complexing into micelles
with **bile salts (from the liver)**. At the surface of the absorptive cells
these micelles diffuse into the cell, and accumulate in the apical cytoplasm.
The smooth ER resynthesizes the fatty acids into **triglycerides** , which
aggregate into lipid droplets, and are transported to the Golgi where they
**form chylomicra (glycolipoprotein droplets** ). These move to the
basolateral surface of the cell, which extrudes the lipid droplet into the
lamina propria. Here they move into the **lymphatics** , and thence to the
blood stream where they deposit in the walls of your blood vessels and kill
you.  

          2. **Goblet cells** :  
The second major cell type in the small intestine epithelium is the goblet
cell, a mucous secretor. These are found randomly scattered among the more
numerous absorptive cells. As such, they are **single cell glands**. Their
principal function is to provide a **viscous lubricating film** to the surface
of the intestine, to protect it from abrasion. In histologic section the
apical end of the cell is swollen with large mucous secretory granules, while
the basal end is small, thus assuming the shape of a wine glass or _goblet_.
This shape, however, is an artifact, arising from the swelling of the mucous
granules during fixation. The secretory product is about 20% protein and 80%
carbohydrate.  
  

          3. **Enteroendocrine cells**.  
As described for the stomach: secretory cells aimed toward the underlying
lamina propria. These are infrequent. Some duodenal enteroendocrine cells
secrete **  

            1. secretin  
**Upon contact with the **acidic chyme** from the stomach, some
enteroendocrine cells produce secretin, which travels via the blood to the
pancreas where **it stimulates the bicarbonate-rich secretion from the
pancreas,** helping to neutralize duodenal contents, and to the stomach where
it inhibits acid secretion.  
  
**

            2. Cholecystokinin**  
Similarly, **fats and protein products** in the upper intestine result in
enteroendocrine secretion of **cholecystokinin** which stimulates pancreatic
juices and emptying of the **gall bladder bile.** Bile helps solubilize fats.  
  

          4. **Stem cells** :   
As in the stomach, there is a population of undifferentiated cells which
continuously divide, replenishing their own ranks of stem cells, but also give
rise to cells which replace the other epithelial cells. These are located in
the lower end of the crypt. **Cells are continuously shed from the tips of the
villi** , and new ones arise in the crypts. Thus, there is this slow moon walk
of cells up the crypt, to the tip of the villus, ultimately leaping to their
death in the lumen. The mucosa of the jejunum has the **fastest turnover rate
of any tissue in the body** , with the entire epithelium being replaced every
3-4 days. For this reason, mitotic cells are a constant feature in the crypt
region.  
  
[A clinical manifestation of this rapid turnover rate is the high
susceptibility of this epithelium to cytotoxins administered during
chemotherapy. Such drugs preferentially target rapidly dividing cell,
accounting for some of the intestinal problems associated with chemotherapy].  
  

          5. **Paneth Cells** (R &R; fig 16.16)  
At the very base of the crypt is a cluster of differentiated cells called
**Paneth cells**. These are obvious in histologic section because of the large
eosinophilic secretory granules. These cells are polarized toward the lumen,
thus not mistaken for enteroendocrine cells. Paneth cell function is unclear,
but the nature of the secretory products (lysozyme and defensins) suggest they
might play a role in the regulation of intestinal flora.  
  

          6. **M Cells** (see below,under immune surveillance)  
**

        2. Lamina Propria**  

          1. A loose delicate connective tissue, whose major cell type is the **T lymphocyte**. Also present are many mast cells. These have membrane receptors for the Fc fragment of the IgE, and when stimulated by the binding of the antigen-IgE complex, trigger the release of a cascade of chemotactic agents which draws neutrophils and esoinophils to the area.   
**

          2. Central lacteal: ** In the intestinal villus, there is the blind beginning of the lymphatic system which conducts many of the lipid products absorbed from the intestine to the blood stream. This central lymphatic vessel of the villus is called the **central lacteal** (R &R; fig 16.12) It drains into the submucosa where it joins with a plexus of lymphatics. There are some smooth muscle cells present in the lamina propria which contract periodically, shortening the villus, and milking the lacteal contents into the submucosa.   

          3. **Capillary bed** : The heavily absorptive function of the intestine requires a significant capillary bed for the removal of the absorbed material. This bed collects into veins that head to the liver as the portal vein, where they break up into a second capillary bed.  
**

        3. Muscularis Mucosa**  
A relatively discreet and continuous layer of muscle found throughout the
small and large intestine. MM is found up in the plicae, but not in the villi.  
**

      2. Submucosa**  
Similar to what has been described for other regions, except in the duodenum.
The base of the crypts in the duodenum give rise to the **"glands of Brunner**
" which project _through the muscularis mucosa into the submucosa_ (G &H; fig
1a, p 267). The presence of such glands in the submucosa occurs only in the
duodenum, permitting its histologic distinction from other parts of the GI
tract. Their function is to provide a thick alkaline (bicarbonate rich) mucous
to buffer the duodenum against the inrush of acidic gastric chyme.  
The Meissner's submucosal plexus is present  
  
**

      3. Muscularis**  
Two major muscle layers:  

        * Inner circular  

        * Outer longitudinal  
Auerbach's myenteric plexus between to control muscle activity. The muscle
both mixes the lumenal contents and propels it along. These muscle cells are
coupled by gap junctions. Thus action potentials spread from cell to cell,
resulting in a wave of contraction (peristalsis) which sweeps down the
intestine. .  
  
**Immune surveillance of the intestine**  
You would be horrified at the array of pathogens you ingest on a routine
basis. However, the body considers this a prime opportunity to continually
sample what is happening in the environment, and update the immune system so
that it has the necessary complement of antibodies and T cells with which to
defend itself. It take not a reactive stance, but a proactive stance.
Collectively this subepithelial lymphoid tissue is called MALT or Mucosa
Associated Lymphoid Tissue.  
  
Cells of the diffuse immune system (macrophages, WBCs, antigen presenting
cells, etc.) are present in all connective tissue, particularly deep to
epithelia. However, the presence of such high levels of pathogens in the
intestine results a major presence of the immune system in the intestinal
connective tissue (principally the lamina propria).  
  
This presence occurs as **diffuse tissue** (isolated cells), but also as
**frequent nodules** with germinal centers. In some regions the aggregations
are quite large, and consistently present. Such regions in the ileum are
called **Peyer's Patches** , which may consist of scores of germinal centers,
and be macroscopically visible. An even more extreme example is the
**appendix**. This worm-like projection from the caecum appears to be
primarily a lymphoid organ. Its lamina propria is so packed with immune cells
and nodules that the distinction between lamina propria and submucosa is
commonly lost.  
  
Additional processes have evolved as well:  

        1. **A sampling system**.   
Rather than passively standing by and waiting for occasional breaches or leaks
of lumenal contents from the lumen, past the epithelium, and into the lamina
propria, the immune system has established mechanisms for actively sampling
the lumenal contents:  
  

          1. One component of this sampling system appears to be **lymphocytes** which pass through the basal lamina to live **in and amongst the epithelial cells.** These are thought to return periodically to the lamina propria.  
  

          2. A second sampling mechanism involves a specialized cell in the epithelium overlying lymphoid nodules. At the site, the so called **"M cell"** is found. On its basal surface are invaginations occupied by lymphocytes, and the pseudopodia of macrophages. At the apical surface, which borders on the lumen, **clathrin-coated vesicles take up samples of the lumenal contents.** These vesicles by-pass the lysosomal system to deliver their contents directly to the basal surface where the macrophages and other cells of the nodule process the contents as potential antigens. HIV is thought to gain access to the CT through this M cell-mediated uptake.  
  

        2. **Antibody:**   
IgG is the major antibody of the blood/lymph. IgA is a different class of
antibody, modified so that it is transported from the CT, through the
epithelium, to the lumen in some organs. IgA is found in saliva, tracheal
secretions, and intestine. It is produced in great quantity by the numerous
IgA-secreting **plasma cells in the lamina propria** of the intestine (about
400,000/mm). These originate as **B lymphocytes, are exposed to antigen in the
intestine, migrate to mesenteric lymph nodes, commit to becoming plasma cells,
enter the vasculature, and take the Lamina Propria offramp to the intestine.
Here they crank up the secretion of the IgA.**  
  

          * Some of the IgA binds to the basal membrane of the intestinal epithelium, is transported through the cell to the apical surface where it is discharged, and adsorbs to the surface of the epithelial cell.   
  

          * Most of it enters the circulation, is picked up by the liver, and **actively secreted into the bile** , which is then dumped into the intestine.   
  
**

      4. Serosa:**  
The serosa is largely ignored in most texts. It is at its most obvious in the
small intestine where the outer wall of the small intestine is mostly serosa.
The serosa continues onto the surface of the mesentery.  
  
[Intestinal rupture which breaches the serosa and dumps zillions of bacteria
into the peritoneal cavity, can lead quickly to peritonitis, which can be
rapidly lethal.  
  
Those in need of dialysis sometime have the option of peritoneal dialysis, a
process which entails infusion of fluids into the peritoneal cavity, where it
equilibrates across the serosa with fluids of the intestinal CT. The buffer,
and wastes/toxins it has absorbed are then removed].  
  

    4. Large Intestine:

Consisting of cecum, appendix, ascending/transverse/descending/sigmoid colons,
rectum, and anus. We distinguish in lab only colon and appendix

The principal function of the large intestine is continued absorption. About
90% of the volume which enters the large intestine is resorbed, producing a
product which is much less fluid, and more difficult to transport. Thus, the
contents of the large intestine are becoming more solid, and less fluid. For
this reason there is more need for lubrication to reduce the resistance to
movement of the contents through the lumen. Absorptive cells still dominate
the epithelium, but the relative **numbers of goblet or mucous cells
increase**. Also, the **plicae circulares** which intrude into the lumen, have
also **disappeared** , reducing the resistance to movement of the contents.
Finally, the large intestine has **no villi** projecting into the lumen. (G
&H; fig 14.2)  
  
The bulk of the final waste product, feces, is dead bacteria, undigestible
vegetable matter, and an occasional Lego. Note that these bacteria contribute
vitamin B12 (necessary for hemopoiesis) and vitamin K (necessary for
clotting), and thus are essential and contributing members of the Society of
Intestinal Flora (which meets every year in Daytona Beach).  
Although villi are absent, **there are crypts**

      1. Mucosa  
**

        1. Epithelium**  

          * A simple columnar epithelium like the small intestine.   

          * Absorptive cells still predominate, but   

          * the number of mucous cells has markedly increased.   

          * The crypts have enteroendocrine cells, and are the source of mitotically dividing cells.   

          * Paneth cells are absent, thus distinguishing it histologically from the small intestine.  
**

      2. Lamina Propria**  
Similar to that in the small intestine: loose CT, lymphoid cells, occasional
lymphoid nodules, small blood vessels and lymphatics.  
  
**

      3. Muscularis Mucosa and Submucosa**  
No major changes  
  
**

      4. Muscularis**  
The major change which occurs in the muscularis is the transformation of the
longitudinal muscularis layer from a continuous sheet of muscle into three
major bands, evenly distributed around the intestine (taenia coli, or TC).
There may be a very thin, attenuated layer of longitudinal muscle spanning
from one TC to the next.  
  

    5. Rectum (No, but caused serious damage)

No major differences from colon, until about 2 cm from the anal opening. At
this junction the crypts disappear, the epithelium becomes stratified
squamous, and large circum-anal apocrine glands appear. The lamina propria
shows a plexus of large veins, which can become distended as hemorrhoids. The
amount of lymphoid tissue increases.

    6. Appendix  
The appendix is a small dead-end outpocketing from the cecum, near the Ileo-
Cecal Junction (15 miles south of Green River, pop. 75). It appears to have no
function related to digestion, and is principally an immune organ. It has all
of the layers and structure of the large intestine. However, its lamina
propria is so engorged with lymphocytes and lymphatic nodules that some of
these normal relationships are obscured. Indeed, the lymphoid accumulation
frequently spills past the muscularis mucosa to the submucosa, masking the
normal layering which characterizes the intestine. The purpose of the appendix
appears to be simply the establishment of a cesspool of antigens which the
immune system can pick through at its leisure, looking for something new to
attack (sort of like reporters for the National Enquirer).

Blood Vessels Of the Intestinal Tract  
There are no major structural specializations of the blood vessels which
provide obvious insight to GI tract function. Major vessels ramify in the
submucosa and give rise to smaller branches which form plexuses in the lamina
propria. Capillaries loop out toward the epithelium, or into villi, become
small venules, and return to the vessels of the lamina propria and then
submucosa. What is unusual is that the vascular output of the intestine does
not enter the general circulation, but heads to the liver via the Portal Vein,
where it breaks up into another capillary bed. Thus, the nutrients (but also
toxins) harvested from the intestine are examined by the liver prior to
entering the general circulation. When one capillary bed ends up feeding
another capillary bed, it is called a **portal system** , an arrangement we'll
see elsewhere.

Lymphatics  
The lymphatic component of the GI tract plays a major role in GI function. The
central lacteal of the villus is the origin of this system, and it is into
this that a major portion of the absorbed lipids of the diet are transported.
The milky-white, chylomicron-rich lymph is called **chyle.**

  
  
Digestive System, Part II: Associated Glands

Introduction  
Gastrointestinal function requires the contributions of numerous glands. These
glands range in size from single cells to sizeable organs like the liver. The
glands occur along the entire length of the GI tract, and produce a very wide
range of secretory products. Generally the products are protein, or
glycoprotein in nature, produced in the ER-Golgi, then packaged into membrane-
bound vesicles for transport through the cytoplasm, or for storage in the
cytoplasm until the stimulus for secretion arrives.

The basic properties and terminology of exocrine secretory glands was
introduced in the epithelium lecture.

  2. The Salivary Glands

General functions:  
The oral cavity has a large number of minor, unnamed salivary glands, located
in the submucosa of the oral cavity. These secrete continuously into the oral
cavity, keeping the mouth moist, so that one's foot can slide in and out
easily. These shut down only when lecturing, at which point they vacuum the
mouth to a state of near lunar dehydration.  
  
It is not uncommon for these minor glands to occlude and form small fluid-
filled cysts in the oral mucosa. Other than that, these glands do not get much
attention in your medical education.  
  
The oral cavity also receives the input from the three sets of major salivary
glands: the **parotid** , **sublingual** and **submandibular** glands. These
tend to secrete upon stimulation related to eating (aromas, or food in the
mouth)  
  
One other set of named glands are the **Serous Glands of Von Ebner** , found
in the tongue.  
  
The product of these glands is, collectively, saliva (Latin for "spit").
Saliva is produced at a rate of about 1.2 liters/day (although those of you
with young kids realize that this is a seriously conservative estimate).  
  
The known functions of saliva include:  

    * **Moistening food** with a lubricating fluid to facilitate swallowing (Got Milk?)  

    * Providing the bacteriolytic enzyme **lysozyme** to help keep oral bacteria under control.   

    * Begin the process of **carbohydrate digestion** with alpha amylase, a process which probably adds to the lubrication, as well.  

    * **Secrete IgA** to neutralize pathogens.   
![](GI/gi1.jpg)  
The saliva tends to be rich in bicarbonate and potassium, although the reasons
for this are not clear.  
  

    1. The Parotid Gland  

      1. Parenchyma  

      2. Acini:  
The acini of the parotid are overwhelmingly **serous.**  

      3. Ducts:  
Intercalated and striated ducts are common.  

      4. Stroma  
Fat cells are common in the parotid, and often times considered a
characteristic feature  

    2. Submandibular Gland  

      1. Parenchyma  

      2. Acini  
**Predominantly (80% or so) serous**. Some mixed serous/mucous acini are
present as serous demilunes.  

      3. Ducts  
**Intercalated ducts are very short** , and thus less frequent in section  

      4. Stroma  
Not significantly different from the generic gland.  
  

    3. Sublingual Gland  

      1. Parenchyma  

      2. Acini  
**Mostly mucous acini** , but serous demilunes present.  

      3. Stroma  
No remarkable properties  
  

    4. Pancreas  
The pancreas is a large gland, containing both **endocrine** and **exocrine**
components. The majority of the pancreatic mass is exocrine, consisting of
acini/ducts which contribute about 1200 ml of digestive enzymes and fluids to
the intestine daily.  
The **Islets of Langerhans** , small islands of cells scattered throughout the
pancreas, constitutes the endocrine component. The endocrine secretions are
hormones largely associated with the control of carbohydrate metabolism.  
  

      1. Exocrine Pancreas  

        1. Parenchyma:  

          1. Acini:   
Pancreatic acini are composed of roughly 40-50 pyramidal cells oriented around
a very small central lumen. The cells are a model of protein secretion: apical
secretory granules (zymogen granules), supranuclear golgi, central-basal
nucleus, and basal ER.  
  
Each acinar cell produces a panel of digestive enzymes which target most major
classes of biomolecules: proteins, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, fats. These
enzymes are produced and secreted as inactive precursors, which are not
activated until reaching the lumen of the intestine, thus protecting the
pancreas from self-digestion. After mixing with the intestinal contents the
enzymes are activated.  
  
**No myoepithelial cells are present in the pancreas**.  
  

          2. Ducts:  
A unique feature of the pancreatic ducts is that the initial segment of the
duct is found pushed well into the acinus. These low cuboidal to squamous
cells are thus called **centroacinar** cells because they commonly appear to
be in the center of the acinus, instead of arising at its periphery. The
centroacinar cells are continuous with the intercalated duct. The
**intercalated ducts contribute bicarbonate** (to help neutralize acid
contributed by the stomach) and water to the secretory product.  
  
**Striated ducts are not evident**  
The pancreatic ducts coalesce into progressively larger ducts, ultimately
becoming the major duct (i.e. duct of Wirsung) which empties into the duodenum
at the papilla of Vater. This tall duct exhibits an rare stratified
cuboidal/columnar epithelium.  
  
Pancreatic Physiology:  
The pancreas secretes continuously at a low level, but increases secretion
dramatically in response to hormonal stimulation produced by eating.
**Distension of the stomach** and **introduction of acid into the duodenum**
stimulate the release products from the enteroendocrine cells of the small
intestine, including:  
  

            * **secretin** :  
this promotes **water and bicarb release** from the pancreatic **ducts.**  
  

            * **cholecystokinin.:**   
stimulates **acinar cells to exocytose zymogen granules**.  

      2. Endocrine Pancreas  
There about 1 million islets of Langerhans in the human pancreas, each
containing 2-3000 cells. Each islet is demarcated from the exocrine pancreas
by a thin layer of reticular fibers. This subtle compartmentation, while not
structurally impressive, has permitted the isolation of relatively intact
islets, an achievement which may permit isolation and transplant of functional
islets to diabetics.  
  
Each islet is a loose aggregate of epithelial cells, infiltrated by
capillaries. There are four major cell types present. These are not readily
distinguished from one another in the light microscope without special stains,
or immunocytochemistry. At the electron microscope level, the morphology of
the secretory granules permits identification of some of the cell types.  
  
**

        1. alpha cells** :  
secrete **glucagon**. Granules appear as a dense core with light halo. A fall
in blood glucose results in glucagon secretion. Glucagon acts on the liver to
mobilize glucose from glycogen stores.  
  
**

        2. beta cells** :  
secrete **insulin**. These cells are about **70% of the mass of the islet.**
Granule has a dense crystalline structure in a light-staining matrix. Insulin
is released in response to increase in blood sugar. It promotes uptake of
glucose into cells, particularly liver and muscle.  
  
**

        3. delta cells** :  
secrete somatostatin; granules very mixed in size and density.  
  
**

        4. F-cells:**  
secrete pancreatic polypeptide.  

    5. Liver  
The liver serves not only as an exocrine organ (secreting bile), but also
serves to process incoming nutrients arriving from the intestine. Further, the
liver serves as an endocrine organ, synthesizing and secreting components of
blood, as well as operating as a major player in carbohydrate metabolism and
storage. Numerous other functions have been ascribed to the liver as well.  
  
In order to accommodate these multiple functions, the liver deviates in a
major way from our description of the generic exocrine gland. Bile, the major
exocrine secretory product, is required to be released to the intestine
episodically, upon stimulation. However, unlike the other exocrine organs, the
bile is not stored and concentrated as secretory granules in the cell. Rather
it is continually secreted by the hepatocyte, and conducted via a duct system
to the gallbladder, where the bile is concentrated and stored until the
stimulus for release arrives.  
  
A second major influence on liver architecture is its need for two blood
supplies. Like all organs, the liver needs highly oxygenated blood, and this
arrives via a branch of the aorta, the **hepatic artery**. The liver also
receives the nutrient-rich blood from the intestine. This blood, after passing
through the capillary/venule bed of the intestine, coalesces into the
**hepatic portal vein**. After making it to the liver, this blood supply
breaks up into a second plexus of small vessels in the liver, to deliver these
nutrients to the Hepatocytes for absorption and processing. Having traveled
through the intestine already this portal blood is oxygen-poor but nutrient-
rich. Being the first major target of blood from the intestine means that the
liver is in prime position to process such nutrients, but also is a prime
target for toxins which are ingested. Thus the liver serves the additional
role of detox center, fishing out and neutralizing many of the nasties
absorbed from the intestine.  
  
The hepatic artery and portal vein input merge, at the venule level, then
drain from the liver as the hepatic vein.

Structure  

      1. **Parenchyma**  
The dominant parenchymal cell of the liver is the **hepatocyte.** Also present
is a much less frequent cell, the **Ito cell** , or the **perisinusoidal fat
cell**. Although technically not part of the parenchyma, the **macrophages** (
**Kupffer Cells** ) which are found in the liver sinusoids are also an
important part of the liver.  
  

      2. **The Liver Lobule** :  
Hepatocytes are not arranged as acini, since they have more than just an
exocrine secretory function. Their need for a very special structural
relationship with the vasculature means that the vasculature must necessarily
be described with the Hepatocytes.  
  
Rather than being assembled into acini, the Hepatocytes are assembled into
roughly rectangular plates 0.3 mm x 2.0 mm. Several plates are arranged
radially around a central vein, such that the long edge of the plate abuts the
central vein. The central vein, plus the plates which radiate away from it
comprise the basis for the **classical liver lobule**. In cross-section a
lobule appears as a central vein, with linear arrays of cells radiating away.
Conceptually that's relatively simple. In practice, the plates are more
irregular. Further, as one moves toward the periphery, the space between
plates would get greater. This increased space is filled as the plate splits
into two, or as a new plates arise.  
  
The lobules are packed into the liver in a crudely regular way, conveying a
roughly hexagonal view in cross-section. Notably, in human the lobules are NOT
separated by a significant connective tissue partition (septum).  
  

      3. **Blood Supply to the Lobule**  
The liver is organized around its blood supply, so an understanding of this at
the lobule level is critical.  
  

      4. **Portal Tract (Triad** )  
In a given lobule, three of the corners of the hexagon have a connective
tissue wedge jammed in between lobules. This wedge contains branches of the
incoming blood (an **arteriole** which is a branch of the hepatic artery, and
a **vein** , which is a branch of the portal vein), **lymphatics,** and a
**duct** of the bile outflow system. This collection of vessels and CT is
called a **portal tract** (sometimes called **portal triads** , even though
four structures are present)  
  

      5. **Interlobular Vessels**   
The vessels of the portal tract run parallel the to the edges of the hepatic
plates, (and are parallel to the central vein). At intervals, the arteriole
and vein give off perpendicular branches which run between lobules, feeding
the lobules it is in between. These are called **terminal portal venules**.  
  

      6. **Sinusoids**  
These interlobular vessels give rise to the **sinusoids** : highly irregular,
dilated, anastomosing venules which run between the plates toward the central
vein. Thus these sinusoids are not conventional tube-like vessels. This means
that a plate of Hepatocytes is likely to have sinusoids on either surface,
sinusoids fed by the branches of the nutrient-rich hepatic portal blood from
the intestine, and the branches of the oxygen rich blood of the hepatic
artery.  
  
The walls of the hepatic sinusoids are highly unique, and designed to promote
extensive exchange between blood and Hepatocytes. There are significant **gaps
between cells** , but also numerous **fenestrations** through the walls of the
individual endothelial cells. The basal lamina of the endothelium is
infrequent, if really present. The surface of the hepatocyte fronting the
endothelium is thrown up into **small microvilli**. Thus, plasma readily
percolates between and through the sinusoidal endothelium, into the space
between endothelium and Hepatocytes. This space is occupied by numerous
irregular microvilli, increasing the absorptive surface of the hepatocyte. The
space between endothelium and hepatocyte is called the **Space of Disse, or
the Perisinusoidal Space**.  
  

      7. **The Central vein**  
The hepatic sinusoids all drain to the central vein, at the center of the
classical liver lobule. This central vein ultimately becomes the hepatic vein,
draining into the inferior vena cava.  
  
[The classical liver lobule has been described as the hexagonal structure,
with the central vein at the center, and the terminal portal venule at its
periphery.  
Alternatively, one could redefine what constitutes a lobule, and place the
incoming blood at the center of the functional unit, with the "central" vein
at the periphery. Such a conceptual framework has been called the liver
acinus: those blood vessels which arise from the portal tract (terminal portal
venules), and run along the edges of the lobule are defined as the center of
the acinus. The advantage of the acinus as a definition of the lobule resides
in its consistency with observations on the functional nature of Hepatocytes.
The complement of functions Hepatocytes exhibit appears to be a function of
the distance from the hepatic artery. Those nearest this terminal portal
venule are most active in gluconeogenesis and oxidative metabolism. Those
farthest from these vessels, and nearest the central vein, are most active in
glycolysis and lipid/drug metabolism. This means of defining a lobule appears
more consistent with the origins of some liver pathologies, thus has a
physiologic/ pathologic basis. However, the classical lobule is so entrenched
in the literature, that it is the dominant frame of reference. You should
however, be aware that different means of defining the liver lobule have
emerged].  
  

      8. **The Bile Duct System**  
Bile is the major exocrine secretory product of the liver, and is produced by
the hepatocyte. It is ultimately conducted to the bile duct of the portal
tract, thence to the gall bladder, where it is concentrated and stored.  
  
The difficult part is describing the means by which bile gets from hepatocyte
to the bile duct of the portal tract. This part of the journey is not through
a duct system composed of cells. Instead, two adjacent Hepatocytes will create
a tiny channel (called a canaliculus) between the two cells, which is sealed
by two parallel-running sets of tight junctions. These channels, about 1micron
across, are present between cells, equidistant from the sinusoids which are on
either side of the plate of cells. Thus the canaliculi form a network in a
plane parallel to the sinusoids, but halfway between. The channels of a plate
would be like the wire in chicken wire, with the holes in the wire occupied by
cells.  
  
At the edge of the plate near the portal tract, the canaliculi join up with
the more conventional bile duct in the portal tract, a duct whose wall is a
simple cuboidal epithelium.  
  
Note that bile flow is opposite that of the blood flow, i.e. toward the portal
tract rather than away from it.  
  

      9. **Hepatocytes** :  
A roughly cuboidal cell. Three major surfaces are described:  

        * the perisinusoidal surface: That surface up against the Space of Disse  

        * the bile canalicular surface: That which faces into the bile canaliculus  

        * the lateral surface: those surfaces facing other Hepatocytes.   
Most Hepatocytes have one nucleus, but about 25% are binucleate. The cell, as
befits one which synthesizes plasma proteins, is rich in **RER**. **Smooth
ER** is also a feature however, since VLDL production is a major function as
well. The golgi apparatus is often near the bile canalicular surface. A major
feature of the well-fed hepatocyte is **glycogen,** since liver (and muscle)
is one of the major storehouses of glycogen.  
  
Hepatocytes are a relatively stable population, with a half life of about 150
days. However, the liver is capable of **rapid regeneration** if damaged. In
rodents some 2/3 of the liver can be removed, and is replaced within days.
Human liver is not quite that good, but can regenerate to a significant
degree.  
  
Hepatocyte Functions:  

        1. Produce bile, a complex fluid, which includes:  

          1. **Bile Salts** :   
Synthesized from cholesterol. These serve to emulsify fats in the intestine,
promoting absorption of fatty acids. In the absence of bile, much of the fat
passes through unabsorbed.  
  

          2. **Bilirubin:**  
This is the degradation product of **hemoglobin** , conjugated to
**glucuronide** in the ER, and excreted into the canaliculus. When bilirubin
production exceeds the liver's capacity to process it (as in the hemoglobin
switch after birth) or when the liver function has suffered and can't handle a
routine load of bilirubin, the bilirubin is released into the blood causing
jaundice.  
  

          3. **IgA:**  
As mentioned in our discussion of the immune function of the gut, we noted
that the lumen of the gut contains much IgA. Most of this is derived from the
plasma cells of the gut lamina propria, where it diffuses into lymph, then
into the blood vasculature. An integral membrane protein ( **Secretory
Component** ) is manufactured in liver, and is present in the membrane which
faces the Space of Disse. This binds IgA from plasma. The bound IgA is
internalized in the hepatocyte by **endocytosis** , and transported by
vesicles to the bile canaliculus where Secretory Component is cleaved,
releasing IgA into the bile.  

        2. **Mediate carbohydrate reserves**  
Hepatocytes are a major glycogen store in the body. Glucose is incorporated
into glycogen, and glycogen is degraded to glucose under regulation by a
complex of hormones.  
  

        3. **Blood Lipid Metabolism**  
The smooth ER assembles fatty acids into triglycerides, which are then
combined with proteins to produce Very Low Density Lipoproteins ( **VLDL** s).
These are released into the Space of Disse by exocytosis.  
  

        4. **Synthesis of Plasma Proteins**  
The liver synthesizes **albumin,** the major plasma protein, as well as
fibrinogen, thrombin, factor III (all required for blood clotting),
transthyretin, serum retinol binding protein, among others.  

      10. **Fat Cells of Ito**  
Between the sinusoidal endothelium and Hepatocytes are occasional cells,
containing large lipid droplets. These have gone by several names, but the Fat
Storing Cells of Ito appears to be the most common. Ingested **Vitamin A,** a
lipid soluble substance, is extracted from the blood, and stored in these
cells. (Note to MD-PhD Students: If you have to leave your mark in biology,
_don't_ discover a Fat cell somewhere)  
**  

      11. Kupffer Cells**  
Numerous **monocyte-derived macrophages** are present in the liver, found
typically stretched out across the sinusoids, getting wide exposure to
incoming blood. These Kupffer cells are present at about 1x107/gm of liver.  
  
These cells conduct the usual functions of macrophages. However, their very
large number, and their position in the middle of the blood stream arising
from the intestine, suggest they serve a sentry role to **halt the
dissemination of bacteria and pathogens which might arise from some breach of
the intestinal wall.**  

    6. The Gall Bladder  
The function of the gall bladder is to **concentrate and store the bile**
synthesized and secreted by the liver. Entrance of food into the duodenum
causes enteroendocrine cells to release **cholecystokinin** , which travels
via the blood to the gall bladder where it induces **contraction of the smooth
muscle of the wall** , and expulsion of the contents into the duodenum.  
  
The gall bladder has a simple wall structure, consisting of a mucosa
(epithelium and lamina propria) and a single muscle layer. Thus, no muscularis
mucosa or submucosa are defined.

      * **Mucosa**  
The mucosa is thrown up into tall folds in the empty gall bladder, permitting
it to inflate when full. They do not entirely disappear in the distended gall
bladder however.  

      * **Epithelium:**  
  
A simple columnar epithelium, absorptive in function. Thus, these cells have a
brush border, although not quite as extensive as that in the GI tract.  
  

      * **Lamina Propria**  
Highly vascularized, a feature expected of a structure designed to move fluids
generated in the concentration of bile  
  

      * **Muscularis**  
There is only one muscle layer in the gall bladder, composed of smooth muscle
bundles running in several directions.

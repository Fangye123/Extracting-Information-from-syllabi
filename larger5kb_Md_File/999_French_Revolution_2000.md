**FINAL EXAM (Comprehensive): See Master Schedule (available on Registrar's
home page)**.    Return to Table of Contents

**_Course Requirements_** :

Two mid-term exams, a final exam, and a research project consisting of two
analyses and a web page are the written requirements for this course. Failure
to complete any of the written requirements will be regarded as a failure to
complete the course. In addition, each student will be responsible for two
critiques of other student work. These critiques will not be graded, but
failure to hand them in on time will result in a loss of ten points on the
final grade in each instance. In the case of the take-home exam, written
analyses and the web page, assignments received by me in the week after the
due date will be marked down up to one full grade. Absolutely no assignments
will be accepted after 5 p.m. on the day the week-long grace period expires.
Miss that final deadline, and you have earned an F for the course.

Exams must be taken or handed in on the days indicated in the weekly schedule.
Make-ups will be scheduled and extensions granted only by prior consent of the
instructor, and only for compelling reasons (as determined by the instructor).
If a student, without gaining prior consent, is unable to complete an
assignment on time because of sudden illness or some other extraordinary
event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I cannot be reached
directly or by phone, you must leave a message with the History Department. A
student's request for a make-up of any assignment must be accompanied by a
doctor's note or other written documentation.

_Exams_ : The first mid-term exam will contain short answer identifications.
The second exam will be a take-home exam, and will consist of two essays. The
final (in-class) exam will contain short answer identifications and two
essays, one of which will be comprehensive in nature. Class time will be set
aside before each exam for review as indicated on your weekly schedule, but
the exams may contain other material not covered in these sessions. The exams
will be designed to test acquaintance with the readings as well as the
classroom material. The instructor will be looking for evidence of general
knowledge, an organized and analytical approach to that knowledge, and an
ability to combine the raw materials of the course -- text, classroom
material, documentary sources, discussions -- into pertinent and meaningful
insights. The instructor will also be evaluating your ability to communicate
those insights. Points will be taken off for run-on sentences, grammatical
errors, spelling errors, poor punctuation, illegible handwriting or any other
problems that, in the opinion of the instructor, affect comprehension of the
student's work. Strive above all for clarity. The in-class midterm will be
fifty minutes long, the final will be three hours. Each essay on the take-home
must be a fully developed analysis no shorter than two full pages in length.
For the take-home only, students are permitted to cite the assigned readings
by the use of parenthetical notes containing the author's name and the page
cited. When citing material outside the required books, use an endnote, with
the full citation style outlined in the Departmental style sheet or Turabian
(see below).

_Research Project_ : The research project for this course is to design a web
page.  The web page will be organized around a central argument either for or
against a particular interpretation of important  historical events or
individuals.  Students will choose from a list provided by the instructor of
statements summarizing key interpretations.  In making his or her case, the
student is required to use primary sources from the time period, in addition
to leading secondary sources (that is, the scholarly works of later
historians).  In preparation for the web page, students will complete two
position papers.  They will then construct the web page, and be given an
opportunity to revise the web page before it is evaluated by me for grading
purposes. The details will be explained in class and in handouts. For research
ideas, begin in all cases with the required texts and sourcebook. All students
should meet with me as early as possible about their choice, since library
resources are limited. The first paper will be distributed to other students
in the class, each of whom will prepare a written critique due as indicated in
the weekly schedule. The latter assignment will not be graded, but failure to
complete it will result in a deduction of seven points from the final grade.
Each student will also provide a critique of a web page, subject to the same
procedure. You will each have an opportunity to revise your web pages
accordingly, before I assign a final grade. The final grade will be for all of
these assignments as a whole. Because these assignments will be graded as a
totality, the greatest rewards will go to those who use each opportunity to
improve on their previous efforts. The sources you use for the papers and web
page must consist of scholarly works of article or book length (for the
secondary sources) and primary sources from the period that are relevant to
your topic.  Encyclopedias, historical dictionaries, general reference works,
and general interest web materials may be used to get started and as
background, but should not be relied upon or cited in the papers or web page
itself.  The analyses and first critique _must be printed on a word-processor_
in a standard 10 or 12 pitch font (such as courier or times roman). They
should be double-spaced, with a title page, and one-inch (and no more than
one-inch) margins. The text (not including bibliography and title page) of the
first analysis should be no less than 2 and no more than 4 **full pages** in
length. The second analysis should be no less than 4 pages (which will include
a substantial annotated bibliography), and no more than 5. Your name, the
course name and number, and the date must be on the title page. It must
include a bibliography of all sources cited. Bibliography and endnote
citations must conform to the proper style for the liberal arts, as defined in
the departmental style sheet, or in the latest edition of Kate Turabian, _A
Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations_. **Do not use
MLA, APA or any alternative style current in other disciplines. Unless you
wish to see the instructor fly into a blind rage, do not even _think_ of using
parenthetical notes on any assignment other than the take-home**. The web
pages and web-page critiques may be transmitted to me electronically, or on
disk, but must conform to standards of good presentation (as determined by
me), and be submitted by the due dates indicated.   Each web page should
contain at least two links to the internet sites that you found most useful.

The type of material that must be documented (i.e. cited in endnotes)
includes: controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are
not a matter of broad general knowledge, statistics, all quotes, and
paraphrases or summaries of an author's argument. All direct quotes over two
lines in length must be indented and single-spaced as described in Turabian.

It is imperative that you document source material, but your own points,
arguments and observations _must be in your own words_ : excessive use of
quotes or lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads
easily to the grievous sin of plagiarism. On plagiarism, see under "Honor
Code" below.

**_Class participation_** : Class participation is an essential part of this
course. In most weeks, the last class period will be set aside for discussion
of the readings, especially the documentary source readings. Students must
arrive prepared to discuss the weekly assignments. In order to ensure this, I
will designate at the beginning of each discussion class two or more students
who will be graded for their contributions to the discussion that day. Any
students so chosen who have not read the material or who are absent without
prior clearance from me will receive a failing grade for that day's
discussion. I will rotate the selections so that everyone gets a more or less
equal chance to be "on call". Voluntary contributions from students not
designated by this system will of course be considered positively, especially
when they demonstrate acquaintance and engagement with the reading. Your
overall grade for class participation will not be figured numerically into
your final score, but will weigh heavily nonetheless. It will be used to
decide borderline cases, offset negative trends like absences, or, if judged
to be of significantly higher or lower quality than your written work,
possibly bump you to a higher or lower grade. If I judge this system to be
producing inadequate results, I reserve the right to require other written or
oral assignments to facilitate discussion, and to use these assignments in the
determination of final grades. Knowing, as you do, how sick and sadistic
history professors are, it is in each and everyone's direct interest to make
the discussions work.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Grading_** : The mid-terms, the final, and the research project are worth
100 points each. Your final grade will be determined by the total number of
points you gain out of a maximum of 400\. I do not grade on a curve.
Attendance, evidence of progress or lack thereof in the course of the
semester, and especially class participation, will be used to decide half
grades and borderline cases (which, experience shows, means most students).
Serious attendance problems or misconduct in class can result in a lowering of
grade. The grading scale is as follows:  
    
  _Score_                         _Grade_          388-400 | A+  
---|---  
         372-387 | A  
         360-371 | A-  
         348-359 | B+  
         332-347 | B  
         320-331 | B-  
         308-319 | C+  
         292-307 | C  
         280-291 | C-  
         268-279 | D+  
         252-267  | D  
         240-251 | D-  
         Below 240 | F  
  
_Extra-Credit Assignments_ : Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the
instructor. These assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor on
or before October 13, and will not be accepted unless so approved. They are
worth a maximum of 40 points. Under no circumstances will an extra-credit
assignment be accepted as substitute for any other written requirement in the
course. An extra-credit assignment can only elevate a student into a higher
grade bracket (for example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored the
higher grade on at least one of the three major exams or on the research
project. The assignment must take the form either of an analytical book review
(not a book summary) 3-5 pages in length, or a research paper 7-10 pages in
length, and must utilize sources not assigned in this course. Style of text,
footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to the guidelines of the
departmental style sheet or Turabian. If you decide to do an extra-credit
assignment, it must be turned in no later than November 17 for you to receive
credit.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Attendance Policy_** : Class attendance is a requirement of this course.
Repeated unexcused absences will lead to a reduction of grade. Unexcused
absences totaling 25% or more will result in an automatic F for the course.
The instructor will excuse a student only under the most extraordinary
circumstances. Chronic lateness will also be penalized, since it presents a
class disturbance. If a student arrives after roll is taken, it is the
student's responsibility to place his or her name on the class roll no later
than the end of that class period. Failure to do so will result in an
unexcused absence.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Honor Code and Plagiarism_** : Students are expected to observe the honor
code. All work for this course must be pledged. Students found to have cheated
on an exam or to have plagiarized material in a paper will be subject to the
maximum penalty under college rules. For those in doubt about the definition
of plagiarism, it consists of copying passages from a source without both
attribution **and** quotation. If you have reproduced the language of your
source, you have committed plagiarism whether or not you have cited the source
and the page number. This includes passages that a student may have modified:
for example, changed verb tenses, omission or replacement of occasional words,
reshuffling of phrases, sentences or paragraphs, combining of different
plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper in your own words is far better than
writing a good one using the words of someone else. One suggestion for
avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts and sources: close all books when
writing, and consult them only for specific facts or direct quotes. Also,
proofread your paper with plagiarism specifically in mind. For more on
plagiarism, see the departmental style sheet.

_Tape-recording and Class Decorum_ : Tape-recording of lectures is not
permitted. Students who are excused from class by the instructor must make
arrangements with the instructor or with other students to cover the material
missed. Students who skip class without permission are responsible for making
their own arrangements with other students (not with the instructor) for the
material covered in class.

Students are expected to observe class decorum. Students engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent. Food and drinks are not permitted in the
classroom.

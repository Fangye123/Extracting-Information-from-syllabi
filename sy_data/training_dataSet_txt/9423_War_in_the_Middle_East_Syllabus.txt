Course Description

While interstate war has been a relatively rare occurrence in the past 185 years there have been eight major military 
conflicts in the Middle East since the creation of Israel in 1948.  This unhappy recent history provides scholars of international 
relations an unique opportunity to explore and begin to understand the factors that make war between states more or less likely.  
This is the tack that we will take in this class, examining the history of the Middle East since the end of the Second World 
War as a way to understand better the role of military conflict in world politics generally and in the creation of the modern 
Middle East specifically.

Scholars of international relations have argued over the impact of arms races, alliances, relative capabilities and the influence 
of great powers on the probability of states resorting to military force to settle disputes.  Other questions include whether a 
state can deter another state (and whether we can tell if deterrence is taking place) and whether states "learn" from past 
experience.  We will trace the antecedents of the various Middle East wars to determine what lessons about war in the 
international system can be learned.  As a result, the class will start with a brief survey of Middle Eastern history prior to the 
creation of Israel and the independence of the various Arab states before progressing through the wars between Israel and her 
Arab neighbors and culminating in the two Persian Gulf Wars - the two major Middle Eastern wars not to involve Israel.  We will 
then examine a series of different issues important to the study of international military conflict to determine what impact these 
issues may have had on the wars in the Middle East.

Course Requirements

The format of the class will largely be discussion, with a minimum of lecturing.  Many of the class meetings will start off with the 
provision of definitions and a general discussion of concepts in the reading before turning to an application of those concepts to 
the particular case or cases being considered.  As a result, it is critical that you come to class having completed the reading 
ahead of time and that you take some time to mull over the readings and consider any implications of events discussed for the 
concepts being examined.

The quickest and most reliable way to contact me if you have a question is through email.  I will also be using email to disseminate 
information to the class.  As this class is based largely on discussion - and participation makes up a sizable chunk of your grade - 
you are expected to come to class each day prepared to contribute.  In addition, certain norms of behavior are expected.  I 
understand that discussing events in the Middle East is often with fraught with controversy and emotion and, as a result, it is 
sometimes easy to slip into ad hominem attacks.  Such behavior will not be tolerated and will adversely affect your grade.  If you 
have any problems with the class, or with some of the material, make sure you come and talk to me.  Waiting until the end of 
the semester will only make it more difficult to resolve any problems that may occur.

The breakdown of the grading for the classis as follows:
Class participation -- 25 percent
Midterm -- 15 percent
Paper -- 25 percent
Final exam -- 35 percent

The grade for class participation depends on students' preparation for, and participation in, the class, performance on various 
quizzes and think piece papers, and attendance.  Think pieces are brief papers incorporating a specific topic on the syllabus 
and/or a major current event in the Middle East.  Specific directions will be handed out with the assignment and page limits 
will be strictly enforced.  The idea is not to write a great deal on a subject but to describe and explain an event concisely and 
accurately.  Quizzes may or may not be announced in advance, though careful preparation and steady attendance should 
make the quizzes not a problem for anyone.  The one quiz that is announced in advance is the Map Quiz - this quiz will be 
held next week and requires that you can identify the states and state capitals, as well as major bodies of water, in the Middle 
East.

Both the midterm and the final exam will be in-class and will include a combination of short identifications and essays.  The 
midterm will take place after we complete our survey of the history of the Middle East.  The final exam will be comprehensive.  
The major paper will most likely involve an in-depth examination on your part of a major event in Middle Eastern politics over the 
past fifty years and how that event can provide us with answers to questions of importance in the study of world politics.  More 
details on the paper will be provided.  NO EXTENSIONS will be granted for papers.  You will be informed of all assignments well 
in advance, so good planning and time management skills will benefit you.  Assignments must be handed to me before the start 
of class on the day they are due.  Late papers will suffer a penalty of a letter grade per day it is late [e.g. A to B etcÂ…].

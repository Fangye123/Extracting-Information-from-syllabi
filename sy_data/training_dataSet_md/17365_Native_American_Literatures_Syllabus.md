## Syllabus for Anthropology 333: Native American Literatures

Summer session I  
Cabell 319, MTWThF 1:00-3:15  

How is Native American Literature defined, and what part should American
Indian languages and live verbal performances have to play in this definition?
Are our own cultural assumptions that accompany the distinction between
contemporary literature and oral tradition warranted, or do these need to be
rethought? These are some of the questions addressed in this class. We will
read novellas, short stories and poetries. Our reading will be interwoven with
experiences of films, poetry-slams, audio-recordings, and Web publications. We
will compare the written work of contemporary Native American authors with
examples of oral performances by persons living in Native American
communities, including performances recorded by local artists, educators,
anthropologists, linguists and folklorists.

Classes will be divided into short lectures, audio/video experiences,
participatory readings, and discussion. Students will write three 3-page
essays addressed to the readings and complete a short ethnopoetic analysis of
a Native American language oral narrative of their choosing from a list of
available online resources. **Student grades will be based upon:**

  * three 3-page essays 20% each
  * ethnopoetic analysis 20%
  * student participation/reading response 20%

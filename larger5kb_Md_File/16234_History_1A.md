  **COURSE DESCRIPTION**  

The purposes of the course are two-fold.  First, as an essential part of a
liberal education, the course will assist students to develop their skills of
critical reading, thinking, speaking and writing.  Second, the course will
introduce students to western history from the beginnings of civilization to
800.  It will emphasize the Near Eastern origins of civilization, the Greco-
Roman cultural synthesis, the impact and influence of Judaism, Christianity
and Islam on the religious, social, political and intellectual life of the
West, and the birth of Europe in the early middle ages.  


**RESPONSIBILITIES AND ASSIGNMENTS**  

(1) Attend lectures and participate in discussions.  The lectures will provide
background to the period and the readings.  The heart of the course will be
the in-class discussions focussing on the readings and interpretive issues.  
(2) Reading assignments correspond to the discussion topics (see below).
Students must complete the readings prior to the first lecture on Monday.  The
course places particular emphasis on the assigned primary sources, so read
them with care and be prepared to discuss them intelligently in discussion
sections.  The texts for the course can be acquired at the Union bookstore.  
(3) Students will complete two five-page essays.  The teaching assistants will
grade them carefully.  The first paper will be returned to students to
rewrite.  
(4) Tests will consist of essays and short-answer identification of terms.
The essays will consist of the lengthy explication of a passage taken from one
of the primary sources.

    
**WORLD WIDE WEB USE**  

The course will be supplemented by a password protected WWW site which will
contain lecture outlines, images, graphics, maps, terms and time lines
necessary for writing papers and preparing for discussions, lectures and
exams.  This Web site is intended only for the students in the this course and
is not available to the public.  The first paper will be based on work
completed on the WWW, so students should familiarize themselves with the
Internet as soon as possible.  In addition, each section has its own
discussion board.  This is a kind of chat room in which participants in
section can ask questions, make comments, or respond to comments and questions
of other students or of their TA's.  In addition, one discussion board is
reserved for you to ask questions of Dr. Hummer or of other students and TA's
from other sections.  If you have a general question or comment, post it here.

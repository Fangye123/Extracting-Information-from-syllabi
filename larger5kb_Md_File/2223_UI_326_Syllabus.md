**UI 326: Australian Culture**

**Spring 2002 Syllabus**

**Robert Zeller  
** 208-C Grauel  
651-2501

The purpose of this University Studies interdisciplinary course is to provide
you with an introduction to Australia and its culture. We will be exploring
our subject in terms of several questions: Is there such a thing as Australian
culture? If so, what makes it distinctive? What has shaped it? How does it
compare to that of the United States and to that of Great Britain? What can we
learn about American culture by studying Australia's? What is Australia's
current place in the world? (These are questions which you should be keeping
in mind throughout the term.)

In addition to reading and class discussion, we will be viewing films and
slides  about different aspects of Australian life and culture.    In
addition, you will be modifying this Website to make it even more useful for
future students in this course.  

> > _**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**_

>>

>>   1. to increase your understanding and appreciation of Australian culture

>>   2. to enhance your perspective on world affairs as well as on our own
society

>>   3. to familiarize you with some of the major resources for the study of
Australia

>>

>>

>> The main University Studies objectives this course will address are 5
(understanding of various cultures and their interrelationships), 4
(understanding of human experiences and relating them to the present), 2
(critical thinking, reasoning and analyzing), 6 (integrating the breadth and
diversity of knowledge), and 3 (effective communication skills). We will also
to some degree address 1 (locating and gathering information), 8 (making
informed, sensitive aesthetic responses), and 9 (functioning responsibly in
one's natural, social and political environment).

>> **_OFFICE HOURS_ :**  M & W 10:00-11:00; T & Th 8:30-9:30, 11:00-12:00.

>>

>> **_TEXTS_ :** Goodwin and Lawson, eds., _The Macmillan Anthology of
Australian Literature_ ; Macintyre, _A Concise History of Australia_.

>>

>> **_[RESERVE READING](reserves.htm)_ :** I have put a number of books on
reserve in Kent Library. There is a list posted [elsewhere](reserves.htm) on
this site. Some of them are works which you may simply want to consult. Others
are works out of which I will be making reading assignments.

>>

>> **_[FILM SCREENINGS](films.htm)_ :** In addition to shorter videos which we
will be viewing during class time, I will arrange screenings of five
Australian feature films which will be related to the topics we are discussing
in class. I will expect you to make it to one of the screenings, or to make
other arrangements to see the films, as necessary. Questions relating to the
films will appear on exams and quizzes.

>>

>> **_COURSE REQUIREMENTS_ : **

>>

>>   1. participate in all class activities (including viewing the films)

>>   2. do all of the assigned readings

>>   3. complete all of the writing assignments, including the exams

>>

>>

>> **_ASSIGNMENTS_ :** In addition to the reading assignments, there will be
two formal writing assignments--a collaborative project and a research paper.
The collaborative projects will correspond to seven of the major sections on
the syllabus; it will involve a presentation to the class as well as a written
product, which can be in the form of either a paper or a Web page linked to
the course page. The research assignment will be on a topic of your own
choosing (though I would be happy to make some suggestions), perhaps in your
major area. There will be several pop quizzes over the assigned readings
(including reserve readings), summaries of news items related to Australia,
and three exams: two hour exams and a final during the exam period. The final
will consist of both take-home and in-class portions. We will review before
all of the exams.

I will drop the lowest of your quiz grades.

> COURSE SCHEDULE**

**Because most of you have no background in Australian history, and because
the class meets only two days a week, the reading will be fairly heavy early
in the term.   Also, I would advise you to plan ahead and do the reserve
reading when you have spare time and not to wait until the evening (or
morning) before class.  I will post most of the material on the Web site.
Copies of Moorehead and Vandenbeld will be on two-hour reserve.  Have the
readings done _by_ the dates listed on the schedule.  **

**The readings with page numbers in parentheses are from _The Macmillan
Anthology_.    "Macintyre" refers to _A Concise History of Australia._**

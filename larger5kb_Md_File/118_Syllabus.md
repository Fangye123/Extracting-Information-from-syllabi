    **II.	INFORMATION ABOUT THE COURSE:**
         

>

>      The "History of Women in Music" is the only course in the State and
among the few of growing course

>     across the country which examines exclusively women's experience in
music:  as artists, composers,  
>     patrons, and as major influences on acclaimed male composers.  Current
music history textbooks are

>     still largely oblivious to these significant contributions and most fail
to give even passing mention of

>     women's contributions as creators of music.  However, research over the
past 20 years has shown

>     that women have been writing and performing music for as long as their
male counterparts.  However,

>     owing to the sociological climate of earlier times their work has gone
largely unnoticed, unpublished,

>     unperformed, and has been quickly forgotten until scholars and
professors started publishing and

>     devoting courses exclusively focussed on women's contributions. Ideally,
this information should be

>     regularly incorporated into the context of all historical courses in the
field, but rarely is even mentioned.

>     Therefore, "History of Women in Music" will survey and examine the
musical achievements of women

>     as well as the historical contexts that shaped and defined their
artistic development.  The class will

>     survey the previously neglected contributions of women musicians from
the Ancient Greeks to the

>     present era; will present biographies of outstanding women composers and
performers; will explore

>     a sociological analysis of women musicians as a class; will present
analyses and performances of

>     representative compositions; and will provide examples of women's music
from all periods including

>     medieval chants, renaissance song,  opera, German lieder, chamber music,
jazz/folk music, women's

>     music in non-western cultures, and twentieth century compositions by
prominent women of our era.

>

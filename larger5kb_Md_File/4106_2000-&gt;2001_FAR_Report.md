**B.** A **summary** of the data available in the College of Behavioral and
Sciences for the Spring 2001 SET  [ **S** tudent **E** valuation of **T**
eaching] indicates that students continue to regard me as a "Superior" or
"Very Good" teacher. In **SET** -Part I, students were asked to respond to ten
statements as follows: "Strongly Agree, Agree, Neither Agree, Disagree,
Strongly Disagree, or Does Not Apply." **The majority of students responded
with** "Strongly Agree"  [ **SA** ], or "Agree" [ **A** ]. The statements
were: **#1:** The syllabus explains course requirements; **#2:** My overall
knowledge of the subject matter has increased due to the instruction of this
course; **#3:** The instructor presents the material in an understandable way;
**#4:** The instructor is well prepared for class; **#5:** The instructor
follows the course syllabus; **#6:** The instructor is available during office
hours; **#7:** The course assignments contribute to learning; **#8:** The
instructor gives appropriate feedback; **#9:** The instructor communicates
high expectations for student achievement; and **#10:** The instructor
monitors student learning throughout the course.

The "open-ended" responses for **SET-Part II** ( **"#1:** "What did your
instructor do to make this class a good learning experience for you?" and
**#2:** "What could your instructor do in the future to make this a better
class?") have numerous positive written responses including: "Stay the same, I
learned a lot, cares, consistently prepared, and he's the best professor I've
had so far!" For question **#3** on **SET-Part II** the following was asked:
"How do you rate the overall quality of teaching in this class? Circle one"
and the options were "Superior, Very Good, Adequate, Minimally Acceptable, and
Unacceptable. For ANTH 13-01, **46%** of the students circled "Superior" and
**41%** circled "Very Good." For ANTH 13-02, **16%** of the students circled
"Superior" and **55%** circled "Very Good." For ANTH 296, **53%** of the
students circled "Superior" and **38%** circled "Very Good." All-of-the above
is consistent with the [FAR/FMI [Faculty Merit Increase] information submitted
on October 2, 2000](http://www.csuchico.edu/~curban/FMIFall2000.html) (for
7/1/1999 to 6/30/2000).

**C. Changes in Teaching:** The classroom environment includes information
from videos, the Internet, Power Point, Slides, and the WWW; the ANTH 13
_Guidebook_ is updated over the semester. Web-based "self-tests" have been
created for students.

**D. Responsibilities** : Serve as Minor Advisor and serve on the Graduate
Committee.

**E. Other:** "Course Link" in fall 2000 of ANTH 13 with ENGL 1, and UNIV 001.

### **V. Special Addition to this web-page FAR**

The following was added to this web page when I re-read the words of Edna St.
Vincent Millay (1892-1950): "It is not true that life is one damn thing after
another. It's one damn thing over and over." More space was available on this
page since there were restrictions placed on submitting the signed original
FAR form as pointed out in Appendix F: "In no more than four (4) typewritten
pages using 12-point type and one-inch margins, provide information on your
activities, contributions, and accomplishments in the following areas, for the
period covered by this report."

I have been a member of the faculty since August **1973** and in preparing the
4-page FAR (and this web page) and going through my records, I have decided
that I continue to be happy with what I do. In looking back on my "Self-
Evaluation" dated **December 1981** (submitted when I was being considered for
promotion to Professor and while I was the Associate Dean in The Center for
Regional and Continuing Education) I made the following statement (and was
promoted to Professor in **1982** ):

> "As my Student Evaluation of Faculty (SEF) forms would appear to indicate, I
could be considered at least an Effective teacxher; and, indeed, a reading of
the computerized & normed information and written student comments could
possibly suggest that I could possibly be considered a Superior teacher. If it
may simply be stated, the fact is that I truly enjoy teaching: I enjoy the
experience of 'sharing knowledge' (such as it is) and I enjoy the experiences
(the give-and-take) of the classroom experience."

Recognized by my colleagues as one of the five "[Master
Teachers](http://www.csuchico.edu/~curban/MT1997Essay.html)" (1997-1999) at
California State University, Chico, my **1981** words are still true in
**2001**. I continue to be happy with what I do.

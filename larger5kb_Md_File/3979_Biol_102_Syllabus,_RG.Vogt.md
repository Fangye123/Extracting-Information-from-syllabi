**Instructor:** Dr. Richard Vogt. CLS 306. 777-8101, [
vogt@biol.sc.edu](mailto:vogt@biol.sc.edu)  
**Office Hours:** Tuesday and Thursday, 5:00-6:30PM, CLS306. If you need
additional help, see me after class, send me an e-mail message, or make an
appointment. **Please note:** my office is in my research laboratory; this is
not a classroom and cannot accommodate extensive undergraduate visitation.
Expect to meet me in hallway outside my laboratory.

Text (required): **Biology, 4th Edition. Neil Campbell. 1996.
Benjamin/Cummings, ISBN# 0-8053-1957-3

**Evaluation/Grade:**  
Lecture attendance is expected; lack of attendance may significantly influence
final grade. Grade will be determined based on numerical scores of 3 1-hour
examinations (100 points each) and a final exam (2 hours, 200 points). The one
hour exams will cover the chapters indicated; the final exam will be 100
questions, 15 from new material covered after the third exam and the rest
cumulative from the material covered on the previous exams. **Exam questions
will be taken from topics indicated in posted study questions.** Letter grades
will be determined as follows. The final letter grade will be determined from
the total numerical score obtained; letter grades will be given to each mid-
term exam to indicate student progress. Midterm, Final and Total scores will
be normalized to a 100 point range (that is, the highest individual grade will
be set at 100). Grades will be: A=90-100; B+=85-89; B=80-84; C+=75-79;
C=70-74; D+=65-69; D=60-64; F= less than 60. No exams may be dropped. Make up
exams will ONLY be allowed if there is a justifiable excuse (in writing). Make
up exams will be given on reading day at 9AM (Saturday Dec 5) (come to CLS
306)..

**Study Tips:**  

* 1\. Introductory Biology is a course of vocabulary and concepts. Vocabulary lists accompanying my lesson outlines at the class web site. Learn the words; learn how they are used. Make flash cards of the words. Your exam questions will assume your familiarity with these words.

* 2\. Read or become familiar with the chapter material before coming to class. DO NOT wait until the last minute to review for an exam. Set aside regular time to review throughout the course. Budget your time with your other course requirements. 

* 3\. When reading a chapter, first, page through and get an overview of what the chapter is about. Topics are clearly marked. Paragraphs are generally organized around a specific topic which is likely indicated in the first sentence. 

* 4\. When studying and organizing, work from the top down. Understand the major concepts of each chapter/subject. Then work towards the details. The exams will emphasize the main concepts first and the details second. 

* 5\. Your exams will assume that you are familiar with all the material presented in the book; however, you will be examined on main concepts, not trivial points (at least as I see them). The text book is an integral part of this course, it is not merely a supplement to the lecture. Rather the lectures will be used to outline the concepts presented in the chapters and to clarify difficult concepts presented. 

* 6\. Take careful notes during lecture. Rewrite your notes during the first 24-48 hrs following the lecture. Review anything that seems unclear to you when you rewrite your notes.

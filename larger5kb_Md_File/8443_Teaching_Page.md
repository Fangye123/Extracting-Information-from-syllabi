# Teaching Ethics and Teaching Experience

## My Personal Teaching Ethics

Written guidelines of ethical behavior are binding regulations. I see it as an
important aspect of good citizenship behavior to participate in a democratic
process that establishes these regulations. However, personal ethics concern
extra contractual behavior and, therefore, clearly go beyond institutional
regulations. For that reason I see formal regulations as ineffective in the
promotion of ethical behavior.

My approach to ethics depends on the morality of the individual who is the
sole judge of her own behavior. This is different from an approach where a
recipient, or an agency representing the interest of the recipient, creates
"ethical" regulations imposed on the actor. My form of ethical thinking is
deeply rooted in Kant's idea that moral law cannot be justified by reason, but
can only be obeyed for its own sake. Reason is the principle by which policies
and regulations for rational bureaucratic organizations are built. Moral
action can only be motivated by personal duty and not by institutional reward
structure. Owing to these inherit shortcomings of institutional control
mechanisms in matters of ethics, teaching ethically is an important task left
to the individual.

In this spirit of self-responsibility I see my teaching as leadership by
example. I try to demonstrate to students that there is a self-rewarding
system of ethical behavior. This philosophy does not restrict myself to be the
only model -- quite on the contrary -- others, and especially students, should
be encouraged to serve as examples. The encouragement of students to be their
own moral judges is a critical mission for me as a teacher. Not claiming a
moral monopoly, but instead holding and respecting personal moral values led
my students to express very positive remarks about my ability to present and
respect a multitude of different standpoints.

Humor is another important aspect of teaching. When the humoristic effect is
shared by the audience, then humor becomes an important teaching tool for
three major reasons: to motivate the class, to demonstrate abstract thinking
and to reveal the nature of social relations. Most teachers are aware of the
instrumental use of humor: to "wake up" the class. I go beyond this aspect of
humor. Humor is an art of seemingly irrelevant transfer; as such it is an
important tool to demonstrate abstract and critical thinking. In sociology
humor has an important aspect that was already shown in the 14th century by
Till Eulenspiegel. Legends of this medieval jester describe how humor can
reveal the mirror that reflects the underlying nature of social relations.
This mirror serves as a powerful teaching tool. If this tool is
institutionally prescribed, it can only appear as grotesque. Just as personal
ethics, humor is an extra-contractual component that has to be implemented by
a self responsible person.

## Teaching Experiences

> Since 1995, I developed 32 electronic syllabi for the World Wide Web.  This
method of Internet based teaching was widely copied.  Copying of good ideas
was the basic principle that developed the Internet.  I also received formal
requests for permission to copy my method from institutions.  We do not earn
copyrights on teaching techniques, but documentation of my innovation is
provided by national and international awards, professional presentations and
one publication.  Today, the electronic syllabus is a standard teaching tool
on the Internet.

>

> Committed to excellence in teaching, I used the student evaluation forms of
Indiana University as additional information about the perception of my
teaching.  Student evaluation forms used until Spring 2001 at TTU basically
inquired the attractiveness of the instructor with three questions.  These
evaluations did not provide helpful feedback for the instructor.  In addition,
since dissimilarity is generally stigmatized, it discriminated against the
diversity that I add to the TTU faculty.  I offered my constructive critique
and, finally, an evaluation form very similar student very similar to the one
I used was adapted at TTU.

>

> As a teacher known to be able to connect to our young incoming students and
to promote independent thinking, I was suggested teaching the freshman seminar
IS1100.  
>

> Although I already received intensive training in pedagogy and class
management at Indiana University, I appreciated the additional training that
we receive on the Junction Campus for the freshman seminar.  This was one of
the occasions where I presented modern teaching tools to TTU faculty.

>

> I did not contribute to grade inflation but maintained high standards of
achievement.  In five years, this dedication led to one accepted publication
in a refereed journal coauthored by one of my graduate students. Another
manuscript with a graduate student as a coauthor is currently under review.
Two papers of a graduate student were just accepted at our national
association meeting for presentation.  One paper I am first author and on the
other paper second author.  Forced to select one, I opted for the paper where
the student is first author.  This will be more prestigious for the students
who will use the national meeting for meeting the representatives of Ph.D.
programs.  I also mentored the an undergraduate student who just submitted the
product of our independent study class as his single authored manuscript to
one of the most widely read peer reviewed journals in sociology.

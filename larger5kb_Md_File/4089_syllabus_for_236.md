This course is an introductory survey of the social, political, intellectual
and cultural history of England from 1688 to the present. Participation in
discussions and completion of assignments are necessary for success in the
course. You will be more likely to understand lectures and discussions if you
have done the required reading before you appear in class.

The required readings for the course, available in the UWS Bookstore are:
Heyck, **_The Peoples of the British Isles_** , vol. 2; Hopkirk, **_The Great
Game_** ; Roberts, **_The Classic Slum_** _._

The grade for the course will be decided as follows:  
First examination 25% Feb 28  
Second examination 25% Apr 18  
Attendance, assigned work, and participation in discussions 25 %  
Final examination 25%  Thursday, May 16 1-3:00pm

There will be a short (4 pages) paper required during the semester as well as
several written in-class assignments. The short paper will require you to read
one novel or one diary, (or book of letters, or autobiography) and write about
it. See attached list from which you can choose. We will discuss the
reuirements for the paper in class on March 7. I do not accept late papers.

There will be no make-up examinations unless you notify me before an exam that
you are unable to attend. Your circumstances must be exceptionally dire before
I will agree to a make-up.

**If, because of a disability, you have any special requirements for taking

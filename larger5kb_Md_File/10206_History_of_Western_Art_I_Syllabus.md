> ###  **Attendance, Class Participation and Decorum**

> **You are responsible for all material in the assigned reading, the images
shown in class, and reproduced in the text. Class attendance is a requirement
of the course. Please see the college catalogue for class attendance policies.
More than three unexcused absences will result in a warning letter from the
Dean of Students.   Repeated unexcused absences following the warning letter
will result in being withdrawn from the class failing. Absences totaling 25%
or more will result in an automatic F. If a student arrives after roll is
taken, it is the student's responsibility to place his or her name on the
class roll no later than the end of that class period. Failure to do so will
result in an unexcused absence.  Excused absences are outlined in the college
catalogue.  Please notify the instructor prior to the class you will miss for
an excused absence.**

> **Using class time effectively is as important as showing up. Think of
classes as guided study sessions. The more effectively you use them, the
better you will do, and the less time outside of class you will need to spend
preparing for exams. Use classes to ask questions, review main themes, try out
interpretations, and practice applying analytical terms to examples. _Above
all, take good notes._ Force yourself to make a thumbnail sketch of each slide
shown. Note the artist, title and medium of the work and a date. Remember the
overall topic of the lecture and analyze why it is included. If you learn
better from audio materials, tape classes and edit them later, but you still
need to sketch the images shown. Without a written or audio record, you have
nothing to review. Without review, learning is inefficient at best.**

###  ** Quizzes**

> **Quizzes will include, but are not limited to, slide identifications and
comparisons. A complete identification includes the maker and the maker's
culture, title of the work, medium, and date produced.**

###  **Mid-term and Final Exams**

> **Each exam will have three parts: Slide identifications; slide comparisons;
and essays. The last two parts will be cumulative.**

>

> **Exams and quizzes must be taken when scheduled. Make ups will be scheduled
only by prior consent of the instructor, and only for compelling reasons (as
determined by the instructor). If a student, without gaining prior consent, is
unable to take an exam due to sudden illness or some other extraordinary
event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I cannot be reached
directly or by phone, you may leave a message on my voice mail (ext. 7057).
Unexplained absences from exams will result in a F.**

###  **Paper Requirements**

> **The paper is to be a written description and analysis of a work of art of
your choice, but approved by me. The work of art fall within the geographic
and chronological limits of the course. I want you to have seen the work of
art in person. For this reason we take a field trip to the Virginia Museum of
Fine Arts.   The paper will include a discussion of the medium, scale, color,
composition of the work.  I want you to articulate how these elements
contribute to the success of the work. You will also include a description of
how this work fits with the artist's work or culture and who or what
influenced the artist as he or she made the work. **

>

> **Please use at least three sources, one of which may be the text book. The
paper is designed specifically to show that you can analyze a work of art
visually and tie this analysis to research on that work of art. Meet with me
about your topic as early as possible in the semester. I require that the
paper will be done specifically for this class and not crafted so as to be
acceptable for other classes as well.**

>

> **The paper must include a bibliography of all sources cited. Bibliography
and footnote or endnote citations must conform to the proper style for the
liberal arts.**

###  **[Click here for Art History Paper Style Sheet (including bibliography
and footnote styles)](../papersylesheet.html)**

> **The type of material that must be documented (i.e. footnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge, statistics other than those your tabulate
yourself, all quotes, and paraphrases or summaries of an author's argument.
All direct quotes over two lines in length must be indented and single-
spaced.**

>

> **It is imperative that you document source material, but the _argument or
thesis of your paper must be in your own words:_ excessive use of quotes or
lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and can lead to
plagiarism.**

>

> **To preserve my sanity, _PROOF READ YOUR PAPER AT LEAST ONCE BEFORE YOU
HAND IT TO ME._ That means read it out loud to see if it is in English. Would
you want your mom to read it aloud to your dad, your aunt to your uncle, your
high school English teacher to your college English prof? I will read drafts
of papers. Anything put under my office door will be read and returned by the
next class period if at all possible. You may also submit drafts to my public
folder (Winston, Prevo). Submitting drafts is not a substitute for submitting
the finished paper.**

###  **Honor Code and Plagiarism**

> **The college honor code will be enforced. Plagiarism is the intentional use
of another's words or argument without proper credit. This includes copying
passages from a source without both attribution and quotation. If you have
reproduced the language of your source without quotes and footnote, you have
committed plagiarism whether or not you have cited the source and the page
number. This includes passages that a student may have modified: for example,
changed verb tenses, omission or replacement of occasional words, reshuffling
of phrases, sentences or paragraphs, combining of different sources. Writing a
bad paper in you own words is far better than writing a good one using the
words of someone else. One way to avoid inadvertent plagiarism is to close all
your books when writing, and consult them only for specific facts or direct
quotes. Also proofread your paper with plagiarism in mind.**

###  **Extra Credit**

> **Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the instructor. These
assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor. They are worth a
maximum of 10 points. No extra-credit assignment will be accepted as a
substitute for a class requirement. The assignment is either an analytical
book review, 3-5 pages in length, a second paper following the requirements of
the paper as listed above, or reviews of exhibitions.**

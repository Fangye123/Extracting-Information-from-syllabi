_Truth or illusion, baby, which is it?_ \--Edward Albee  
  
Basic premises of the composition part of this course:  

  * Writing is the only way to closely examine and develop critical thinking. 
  * All a piece of writing needs to do is to communicate an idea to a reader in the most effective way possible. 
  * The best way to learn how to write is to write, the best way to learn how to think is to think. 
  * If you know what you want to say but can't say it, you don't know what you want to say; it's not a "writing problem," but a need to think through ideas more completely. 
  * Grammar/punctuation are a problem if they get in the way of meaning. 
  
**Statements on the Objectives of History**  
_Understanding, not certainty, is the aim of history._  
\--John Lukacs  
  
_History is like looking in the mirror. If we are honest we may see ourselves
as others see us._  
\--William Appleman Williams  
  
One main drive of education is the search for TRUTH. History forms one avenue
in this quest. A primary objective of this course is to develop the ability to
analyze and evaluate events, ideas, trends and personalities. For this reason,
emphasis will be placed on critical thinking about interpretations.  
  
IMPORTANT: Because truth changes, history changes. Or, to put it another way,
each generation sees the past from a different perspective. It is this
changing face of the past that makes history exciting.

**Absence Policy** :  
Attendance is expected. Any time you are absent, you are expected to read the
syllabus, check the assignment with the instructors or another student and
come to the next class fully prepared.  
  
**Late Paper Policy** :  
You are allowed one late paper during the term. Having extra time for the
paper will, of course, mean that it should be of even higher quality than a
paper handed in on time.  
  
  
**Grades** :  
**English** :  
During the semester, you will receive feedback about your essays from
instructors and students. At the end of the semester, you will choose your
best work to be included in a portfolio, which will be given to two readers on
the faculty who will grade the portfolio independently. This will benefit you
in several ways: 1) the readers won't see your mistakes, but will evaluate
only on your best work, 2) the readers won't be influenced by personal
factors, but only by your writing, 3) you will be allowed to revise as often
as you feel necessary to get the grade you wish, 4) your instructor is in this
with you: if bad papers are sent to the readers, that will reflect on all of
us.  
  
Your grades for English and History are independent of each other.

_Once there was a flock of geese. They were kept in a wire cage by a farmer.
One day, one of the geese looked up and saw that there was no top to the cage.
Excitedly, he told the other geese, "Look, look: there is no top. We may leave
here. We may become free." Few listened, and none would turn his head to the
sky. So one day, he simply spread his wings and flew away -- alone._  
\--Soren Kierkegaard  
  
_I tore myself away from the safe comfort of certainties through my love for
truth; and truth rewarded me._

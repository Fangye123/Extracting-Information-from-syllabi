**RD600 Circumpolar Indigenous Leadership Symposium (3 credits)**

     This course is designed as an intensive face-to-face graduate seminar over a 10-day period. In fall 2000, it will be held in Fairbanks. It is a cornerstone course for all MA students in the program. The content focuses on indigenous leadership and includes presentations by practitioners from throughout Alaska and the circumpolar North. The course may be repeated once as elective credit.
andnbsp;

**RD601 Political Economy of the Circumpolar North (3 credits)**

     The course provides graduate students with a comprehensive overview of inter-relationships between rural communities in the circumpolar North and global socio-economic, political, and ecological systems. It highlights major theoretical advances in our understanding of "development" in the 20th century, and uses a comparative case study approach to understanding rapid socio-economic and cultural change in the North.
    andnbsp;
**RD625 Community Development Strategies:  
Principles andamp; Practice (3 credits)**

     This course provides graduate students with a detailed overview of principles and strategies of community development in rural Alaska and throughout the circumpolar North. Through in-depth case studies, it expands on materials and topics covered in RD undergraduate courses on community development to explore how rural communities in diverse cultural, political, and economic settings can build on local assets, skills, and capacities to improve the lives of indigenous and other Northern residents. 
    andnbsp;
**RD650 Community-Based Research Methods (3 credits)**

     This graduate course provides students with opportunities for advanced exploration of community-based research principles and practices. In the course, emphasis is placed on developing a thorough understanding of the community research process from conceptualization to implementation and evaluation. It includes skill development for both quantitative and qualitative research.
    andnbsp;
**RD651 Management Strategies for Rural Development (3 credits)**

     This course provides a graduate level overview of managing change and development among indigenous communities with a particular emphasis on rural development in the Circumpolar North. The course looks closely at recent management strategies implemented in Alaska such as co-management of renewable resources; land management of Alaska Native corporations; cultural resource management; and the management of Alaska Native tribal governments, corporations and other organizations. The class utilizes comparative case studies and effects of cultural and traditional values on management practices in different northern socio-cultural environments.
  
**RD652 Indigenous Organization Management (3 credits)**

     This course looks at the purposes, structure, and methods of management of indigenous organizations with particular emphasis on indigenous organizations of the North. The management of Alaska Native organizations will be compared with formal organizations established by indigenous peoples in other regions of the Circumpolar North. The concept of "indigenous management" will be reviewed, as will perceptions of differences between leadership and management in both western and indigenous settings.
    andnbsp;
**RD655 Circumpolar Health Issues (3 credits)**

     This course provides a comprehensive overview of major circumpolar health issues affecting Northern residents. It includes an analysis of health and traditional healing practices and the history of epidemic diseases in during and after contact. It examines the emergence of chronic diseases, problems of alcohol abuse and violence, and efforts to combine traditional healing practices and community healing with Western medicine. The course also provides an overview of environmental health issues and public health infrastructure and systems in the North.
    andnbsp;
**RD698 Applied Community Development Project (6-9 credits)**

     This course is one of two options for MA students in Rural Development:   
completion of an applied community development project  
OR completion of a MA thesis (RD699). The number of credits allowed (between 6
and 9) will depend on the nature of the student's project and must be approved
in advance by the student's graduate committee. RD698 enables the student to
complete a project under the supervision of the graduate committee.

    andnbsp;
**RD699 Thesis (6-9 credits)**

     This course is one of two options for MA students in Rural Development:   
completion of an applied community development project  
OR completion of a MA thesis (RD699). The number of credits allowed (between 6
and 9) will depend on the nature of the student's project and must be approved

What Students Say  
"Learning is a never ending process. It empowers you and is something no one
can ever take away from you. This program is a God-send for rural Alaskans who
are in villiages and are already employed. "

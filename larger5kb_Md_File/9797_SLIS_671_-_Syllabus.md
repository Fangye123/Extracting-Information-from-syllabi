COURSE DESCRIPTION

The course is designed to acquaint students with the history of the culture of
print in the Western World from ancient times through the nineteenth century
in Europe, and with the history of the culture of print in the United States
from colonial times to the present. Emphasis is on examination of the
influence of print on social, cultural and intellectual life.

OBJECTIVES

  1. The student will demonstrate a basic knowledge of the role of printed products in the development of the Western World, and especially in the United States.
  2. The student will demonstrate an ability to think critically about the subject in both written and oral work.
  3. The student will demonstrate acquaintance with the literature which explores that role.
  4. The student will demonstrate an ability to assess fairly a portion of that literature by writing two book critiques.

  

METHOD OF EVALUATION

  1. Two examinations: (25% each)
  2. Two book critiques (20% each)
  3. Class discussion: 10%

  

DISCUSSION:

Because the history of books and printing comprises such a vast area both
temporally and spatially, your course instructor is forced to pare and focus
the subject for this class in order to make it manageable. Consequently,
students will find very little coverage of print culture history outside of
the Western World (e.g., Asia, Africa, South America, Australia, etc.); nor
will they find much coverage of the antiquarian, bibliographical, and
technological aspects of the subject. Time, unfortunately, does not allow for
it.

That should not, however, prevent students from pursuing these aspects
independently, and getting credit for their effort. The two book critiques
provide excellent opportunities for students to explore them, if they wish.
Because much of the emphasis in-class will be on the social, cultural and
intellectual role which printed products have played in the Western world,
students interested in other aspects of book history not covered extensively
are invited and encouraged to contribute in-class and on examinations by
drawing parallels from the reading they do on their book critiques to what is
being discussed in-class or asked of them in examinations.

Your instructor has placed a "Supplementary Reading List" on his webpage to
assist you in your selections. Any book on the list is an acceptable candidate
for a critique. For books not on the list please get your instructor's
permission.

Guidelines for writing the critiques are attached. Check your syllabus for the
dates on which your book critiques are due. Each time, you must give your
instructor two copies. One will be handed back to you with comments and grade;
the other will be retained in the instructor's permanent file.

TEXTS:

"Guidelines for Critical Analysis of Scholarly Works"

The student will read and review critically any two books published since 1950
that deal in some way with the history of books and printing and that
represent professional contributions to the research literature on the
subject. If titles are not listed on the course "Supplementary Reading List"
on the Instructor's webpage, students must obtain approval of their choice
from their instructor.

Book critiques should be about 1,000 words in length (about four pages, word-
processed and double-spaced.) Please give a full bibliographical citation to
the book at the beginning of your review, and before you print it out number
the pages and use your spell-checker. It should, if possible, include a
paragraph describing the author's background (education, field of
specialization, other publications, etc); a _short_ summary of the content of
the book; and a longer critical evaluation, and especially a critical
evaluation of the research. In the critical evaluation, students should
consider the following questions:

  1. What is the author's thesis or argument? Does it conflict or support theses or arguments presented in other books (or important articles) on the subject"

  2. What are the author's conclusions? Are they valid? Substantiated by the research? Explain and defend.

  3. Was the author sympathetic or hostile to his/her subject? Offer illustrations.

  4. Are the author's organization and style effective? Do they add or detract from the impact of the book? In what ways?

  5. Of what value is the book? Would you recommend it to others? Why, or why not?



Above all, do not, DO NOT, simply rehash the contents of the book. As your
instructor I am interested in what _you_ think of the book, and how you see it
fitting into the field of the history of books and printing. That is the
primary reason for writing the reviews.

Hand in _two_ copies of each review to your instructor on the days identified
on the syllabus. I will hand one back with assigned grade, and will retain the
other copy for my permanent files.

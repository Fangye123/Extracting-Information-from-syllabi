These books are available for purchase at the Vassar Bookstore.  
Most of the other required readings and the recommended readings on the
syllabus are on reserve in the art library.  This course also has a web site
that includes most of the images presented in lecture.  The URL is:
http://iberia.vassar.edu/art251/  In addition, CD roms with images are
available at the Art Library reserve desk.

There will be a mid-term exam (25%), a final exam (35%), and a research paper
(40%).  Regular class attendance and participation in discussion will also
favorably affect your grade for the course.

The paper assignment (about 8 pp. in length) will focus on American
objects¨®painting, sculpture, photography, decorative art, or architecture¨®made
between 1865 and 1945.  It will involve works that you can examine first hand,
and this will probably require a trip to visit a museum in New York.
Suggested topics will be handed out in class before spring break.  The
completed papers will be due by 4 p.m. on April 29 in my mailbox in the art
department workroom.

Academic accommodations are available for students with documented  
disabilities. These accommodations must be approved through the Office of
Disability and Support Services (Ext. 7584).  Students with approved
accommodations should schedule an appointment with the instructor early in the
semester to discuss any accommodation that may be needed for this course.

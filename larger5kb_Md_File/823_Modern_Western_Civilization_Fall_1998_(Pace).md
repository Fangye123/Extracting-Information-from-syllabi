**_Attendance Policy_** :  
Attendance in the class is _REQUIRED_. Because much of the information in this
class comes from lectures and in-class discussions, absences will place the
student significantly behind, therefore, attendance records will be kept. If a
student arrives after roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to
make sure his or her presence has been recorded AT THE END OF THAT DAY'S
CLASS. If a student's absences, both excused and unexcused, equal 25% of the
class days (that means nine classes), the student will automatically fail the
course (no questions asked).

* * *

  
**_Make-up Policy_** :  
Make-up exams will be administered _only_ when students can show a valid
reason for their absence (this means confirmation from either the health
center or from the dean). Students must schedule the make-up exam with the
instructor within one week of the original exam. Failure to make such
arrangements will result in failure of the course.

**_Honor Code_ :**  
Students are expected to comply with the honor code on all work for the
course.  Cheating will result in an automatic "F" for the semester and the
student will be taken before the honor board.

**_On-line Quizzes and Document Reviews_**  
All chapter assignments should be read in the week that they are assigned.
After the student has read the chapter, including the documents placed
throughout the chapter, he or she will use the Internet and go to the Prentice
Hall Webpage for our textbook. Use the on-line instructions to go to the
appropriate chapter(s) assigned for that week. Students must make sure that
the instructor's email address
([rpace@longwood.lwc.edu](mailto:rpace@longwood.lwc.edu)) appears on the form
for the results to be sent to him. Students should also make sure that their
own e-mail address appears on the quiz.  This can be accomplished through
changing the "Preferences" section on the page, or through typing the address
after you have submitted the quiz for scoring. Also make sure you click the
buttons for the chapter number and title to be included. Students will
complete the multiple choice quiz and the documents review sections of the
page each week. The due dates for these assignments are clearly marked above
in the "Course Schedule." **If the quiz has not arrived at my computer by
Wednesday morning of each week, the assignment is considered late.   KEEP THIS
IN MIND--SOMETIMES THE SERVER IS DOWN, BUT THIS IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE EXCUSE.
PLAN AHEAD.  EXPECT TO HAVE DIFFICULTY GETTING THROUGH.  I WILL ACCEPT QUIZZES
AFTER THE DUE DATE, BUT ONLY FOR ONE HALF CREDIT**.

**_Final Exam Research Essay:_**  
 All students will be required to turn in a 750- to 1,000-word essay on one of
the authors of the documents in the text book.  These essays shoulld be
analytical in nature, and they should relate the subject to one of the four
major themes of the book:

  * the development of political freedom, constitutional government, and concern for the rule of law and individual rights.
  * the shifting relations among religion, society, and the state.
  * the development of science and technology and their expanding impact on thought, social institutions, and everyday life.
  * the major religious and intellectual currents that have shaped Western culture.

**__Once you have chosen a subject, you must get the instructor's approval
before proceeding.__**

The essay should have a thesis and should use at least three sources in
addition to the document from the text book.  At least two of these sources
should be from the library, _and they should all be scholarly in nature_ (
**no encyclopedias, magazines, text books, or newsaper articles allowed). __**
Scholarly sources will have a bibliography, footnotes (or endnotes), and are
often published by university presses (but not always).  You may also use a
_primary source_ off the Internet, but you may not use _secondary_ sources
from the web or from other electronic media.   If you are uncertain what the
difference is, find out (or come see me).

All information in the essay should be cited (meaning you need to tell me
where you got the information).  You MUST cite more than just quotations--cite
every bit of factual information that you put in the essay.  You will cite
them using footnotes or endnotes (no parenthetical notes will be accepted--
meaning do not use M.L.A. or A.P.A. style in citing your sources).  This means
that a citation number will appear at the end of a paragraph, and that number
will tell me to look at the bottom of the page (footnotes) or the end of the
document (endnotes) to see where you got the information.  Note numbers should
be sequential, and are not repeated.  They look like this.1  Generally, there
should be about one note number per paragraph, but this is not an absolute.
Some paragraphs will need more note numbers because multiple sources could be
used for that paragraph.  If you have one note number per sentence, you have
too many notes. Further instructions on the style can be found below.  You
should also take a look at the [Department Style
Manual.](http://web.lwc.edu/academic/las/history/HDPTSTS2.htm)

In addition to footnotes or endnotes, you will need to have a "Works Cited"
Page.

The essay will be due at the time of the final exam.  **NO ESSAY WILL BE
ACCEPTED AFTER THE FINAL EXAM.   IF THE ESSAY IS NOT TURNED IN AT THE TIME OF
THE EXAM, YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY FAIL THE CLASS.  THE ESSAY WILL BE WORTH
FIFTY PERCENT OF THE FINAL EXAM GRADE.**

Final Exam Essay Style Guide

 Students should NOT use the Longwood Style Manual or the MLA Style Sheet.
Thus, do NOT  
use parenthetical notes. Only footnotes and endnotes will be acceptable!
Please consult Kate L.  
Turabian, _A Manual for Writers_. 6th ed.

Students should likewise never cite encyclopedias, textbooks, or class notes
in a term paper.

Students are permitted to cite only one electronic document, if that is a
primary source.

The following are some useful examples from Turabian:

Footnoting a book:  
     1Arthur Waley, _The Analects of Confucius_ (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938),   
33\.  
    
If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid. should
be used. Thus,

     2Ibid., 37. (Note that Ibid. is not underlined) 

If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title. Thus,

     17Waley, _Analects_ , 130. 

Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
     3Tucker Brooke, _The Renaissance_ , vol. 2 in _University of Chicago Readings in_   
_Western Civilization_ , ed. John W. Boyer (Chicago: University of Chicago
Press, l986), 402.

Footnoting a Review:  
     4Steven Spitzer, review of _The Limits of Law Enforcement_ , by Hans Zeisel, in   
_American Journal of Sociology_ 91 (November l985): 726-29.

###  Plagiarism

Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in a student
paper without giving proper credit to the author constitutes plagiarism.
Likewise the use of an author's words without placing those words in quotation
marks and providing proper citation is plagiarism. Students sometimes believe
that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in a sentence or
paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism. This is not the case! The information
and ideas taken from a source must be re-formed into your own words! And after
re-forming it into your own words, you must use a footnote giving proper
credit to the author.

If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
essay will be returned ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to
his office to verify the scholarship.

**_Grade Posting:_**  
I will post exam grades on the door to my office for all students who wish to
learn their grade before I give the exams back to the class. If you would like
your grades to appear on this list, you must supply me with a four-digit
number that you can remember, and your grade will be posted next to that
number. Choose a number that has little opportunity of being duplicated (no
1111 or 0000).

Students needing accommodations for disabilities should contact the instructor

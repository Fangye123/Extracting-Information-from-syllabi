**COUNTRIES:** SPAIN  & ENGLAND, OPTIONAL EXCURSION TO IRELAND

**REQUIREMENTS:**

_Class Participation, Punctuality, Take-Home (1/3 of grade)_  
For Graduate students the class participation grade includes a presentation to
the rest of the class sometime during the trip. Topics must be approved by the
director

_Journal (1/3 of grade):_  
You will be required to keep a journal. You should use it as a daily record of
your trip as well as an opportunity to reflect upon your reading material;
this is your opportunity, e.g., to discuss the Archer and Hemingway texts.
The journal should contain all of the notes you have taken during lectures and
briefings.  The journal, then, should be not only a travelogue but should
contain serious academic discussions and notes as well. Please turn the
journal in within a week after we return home, and it will be returned to you
within a week or so. The format of the journal is up to you--whatever you feel
most comfortable with. One consideration would be to use loose-leaf sheets so
that don't have to take your entire journal out each day, thus reducing the
risk of  leaving it on a bus or train seat, etc., somewhere during the trip.



_Research Paper (1/3 of grade):_  
Before departure, you are asked to choose a topic from a list provided, or to
come up with your own topic; in which case the topic must be approved by your
instructors.. By choosing your topic beforehand, you'll be able to gear tour
questions in discussions and lectures so as to gain useful information. This
is a major research paper 12pp requiring at least 12 references and should be
formatted according to MLA standards (see latest edition of MLA stylebook).
This paper is comparative in nature, either involving the U.S., Great Britain,
and Spain, or in some instances the U.S., Great Britain and a third country
other than Spain since information in English on Spain can be hard to obtain,
depending upon the topic.  These papers should be more than descriptive in
nature: they should be primarily analytical in nature, offering solutions,
projections, and commentary, again according to the topic. EVERY PAPER MUST
CONCLUDE BY DRAWING IMPLICATIONS FOR AMERICAN GOVERNMENT, CULTURE, OR PUBLIC
POLICY



Possible topics include:  
_The Role, Relevance and Future of the Monarchy in Great Britain and Spain_  
_Jury System Reform in Great Britain, Spain and the U.S._

National Security and Civil Liberties_

Prepare?_  
_Confronting Racism in Great Britain, Spain, and the U.S._  
_Religion and Education in Great Britain, Spain, and the U.S._  
_Spain as a Model for Democratic Reform For Eastern Europe, Great Britain as A
Model for Economic Stability_  
_Firearms Controversy and Policy in Great Britain, Spain and the U.S._  
_The Upper Legislative House of Great Britain, Spain and the U.S.:
Opportunities For Constitutional Reform?_  
_"Back to Basics": Educational Reform in Great Britain, Spain and the U.S._  
_Military Reform in the U.S., Great Britain and Spain_

Civil War, and/or the Irish Civil War._

**PLEASE NOTE: If your major discipline of study is not political
science/public administration/criminal justice, we can work with your and/or
your department on this research paper, so that your work is more focused on
your area of interest, e.g. if you are a nursing student you might undertake
comparative research on health policy, problems in comparative health
administration, or a comparison of new drug experimentation and approval by
government regulatory agencies.**

**TEXT and READING ASSIGNMENTS:** These books are required and are not
included in the price of the program and must be read prior to departure. All
are easily available either from libraries and/or real and virtual bookstores.

_**These first two books are for pol. sci., crim. justice, & public admin

Spain and England instead of the ones above:_**

The second book should be one of the following:

 _The Abolition of Great Britain: From Winston Churchill to Princess Diana_ by
Peter Hitchens (This book is more polemical than some of the other selections,
but useful and interesting. It is a conservative critique of the declining
cultural standards of the English people

 ** _OR_**

 _Remains of the Day_ by K. Ishiguro (This book, now also a very fine movie,
is a fictional account of English customs, manners, and, in some measure
politics.)

for the assigned books above. You can download the exam and take it anytime
you wish. The link is:

or check them out and read them prior to our first pre-departure class
meeting.(if you have not read them previously):

 ** _For Graduate Students:_**

There are additional reading materials on the European Union required of MPA
or other graduate students, some of which should be presented to the rest of
the class during the trip. See the instructor  for details...



**COURSE PHILOSOPHY and METHOD**  
    In "Comparative Law and Legal Systems" we use every means we can think of the enrich your educational experience abroad. It is important that  pre-departure readings, etc., be finished prior to the trip. You are required to attend several all-day Saturday meetings prior to the trip (dates TBA). During these meetings we will have several hours of lecture, video presentations, group discussion and question and answer periods, as well as opportunities to discuss practical matters like currency exchange, luggage, cuisine, etc. Each day of the trip we will usually have at least one lecture, or what we call a mini-lecture since it will  often be combined with breakfast and/or lunch and will usually deal with the events of the day. On several days we will have 2-3 formal lectures by foreign faculty. (Lectures in Spain will be translated). We will also have several group discussions at appropriate intervals during the trip. You will have the opportunity to attend lectures by foreign attorneys and others. We will visit a number of governmental institutions. During visits to leading art museums, cultural museums and cathedrals, we will discuss not only the art and architecture we see, but we will discuss a great deal of history and politics, since much of the art and construction was occasioned by, and often represents, important events and individuals. Since we are in Europe for only three weeks, we have chosen not to spent the majority of tour time in classrooms, as the opportunities for learning often lie outside the classroom. 

    There are several topics that you should keep in mind during the trip as this format offers a rich opportunity to compare ideas on the same general concepts between the U.S., Great Britain, and Spain. These topics include the basis of law, the purpose and political psychology of a constitutional monarchy, the nature of terrorism, the role of public and private religion, the tension between traditional values and more libertarian views of morality, the influence of ethnicity and geography on individual personality, the importance of national history, the influence of literature on national identity and character, the competition between the  European Union and the U.S., the E.U. and national sovereignty--to name a few.

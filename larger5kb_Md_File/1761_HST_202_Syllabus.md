    Course Description: History 202 is the second of a three-term sequence and offers a survey
    of United States history from 1800 to the turn of the twentieth century.  Themes to be
    explored include the rise of industrialization, Manifest Destiny and conquest, sectional
    conflict and Civil War, Reconstruction and civil rights, homestead settlement, development
    of corporate capitalism, radical agitation, and the rise of the activist state during the
    Progressive Era.
    
    HST 202 is a combination lecture, reading, and discussion course.  In addition to providing a
    survey of the history of the United States during the nineteenth century, the goals of HST
    202 are to:
    
          1. Build the intellectual capacities of students by encouraging critical thinking and
          analysis, thereby making them more fit for whatever career or life they may choose.
    
          2. Improve student abilities to search for and find valid sources of information and
          knowledge through both printed (library) and electronic (Internet) media.
    
          3. Improve the writing skills of students by offering them opportunities to write and
          receive professional feedback on what they have written.
    
          4. Acquaint students (especially younger students) with the standards and expectations
          of the professional world.
    
    
    Course Materials:  There are two basic bodies of material for the course, each of equal
    importance:
    
          1. Lectures
          2. Survey textbook (James West Davidson et al, Nation of Nations: A Concise
                Narrative of the American Republic)
    
    Lectures have been designed, and readings selected, to offer the best possible coverage of the
    period without unnecessary duplication.  This means you cannot rely on just one or two of
    the groups, you must deal effectively with both.  In particular, do not assume that you will
    be successful in this course by merely attending class sessions and taking notes.  You will be
    examined on material contained only in the textbook, as well as material contained only in
    lectures.    
    
    In addition to specific materials assigned in this syllabus or in class meetings, you are
    encouraged to make use of the SOU library.  Of particular value are the following reference
    items:
    
          Dictionary of American History (8 Vols, 1978) Ref. E174.D52
    
          Encyclopedia of American History, ed. Richard B. Morris (1982)  Ref.
          E174.5.E52
    
          The Oxford Companion to American History (1966) Ref. E174.J6
    
          The Reader's Companion to American History, eds. Eric Foner and John A.
          Garraty (1991)  Ref. E174.R43
    
          The National Atlas (1973)  Ref. atlas case
    
    Other materials and books on specific topics in early American history can be found in the
    RogueLinx online catalog under subject "United States--History" or under more specific
    subject headings.  See the instructor for assistance.
    
    
                               Other Course Requirements
    
    Class Attendance: Since lectures will not simply duplicate other materials attendance at each
    lecture is vitally important.  A roll sheet will be sent around each day for your signature. 
    Your attendance record will be used to make borderline grading decisions.  If you must miss
    a class session, make sure you ask another student for copies of his or her notes.  The
    instructor's notes are not available for copying.  Attendance at Friday discussion sessions
    (during regular class hour) is mandatory and will count in your final grade (see Grades
    below).
    
    Midterm Exams: There will be two midterm examinations, scheduled for February 7th and
    March 3rd. The exams will consist of multiple-choice questions and, for the second
    midterm, a take-home essay.   A make-up exam will be given only for medical or other
    unavoidable emergencies.  Each midterm is worth 100 points.
    
    Final Exam:  The final examination will be entirely multiple-choice and will be given .  It
    will consist of two sections: one comprehensive and one dealing with material studied since
    the second midterm.  The final will be worth 200 points.
    
    Grading:  There will be a total of 400 points for this term's work.  Letter grades will be
    based upon a percentage of those points earned, but it will also take into account the general
    performance of the entire class, as well as improvement in scores throughout the term on the
    part of individual students.
    
    Please keep in mind the meaning of those letters as indicated in the Fall Term Class Schedule
    (p.14-15):
    
          A = Exceptional accomplishment 
          B = Superior
          C = Average
          D = Inferior
          F = Failed 
    
    Pluses and minuses will be used to further refine the grading.  Please understand that high
    grades are earned, not given.  You build your grade from the bottom up rather than being
    "marked-off" from the top down.  Your "usual" grades in other courses have no bearing on
    your grades in this course.  No grade better than a "B" will be given for work that does not
    represent exceptional scholarly accomplishment.  
    
    Students do not have the option of failing to complete a course assignment as outlined in this
    syllabus for a lesser grade.  All assignments and examinations must be completed before a
    grade will be submitted to the registrar at the end of the term.  An "I" grade will be
    submitted only after consultation with the professor and the completion of a written
    agreement on what is to be done to fulfill remaining course requirements.  In lieu if such an
    agreement, a grade of "X" ("no basis for grade") will be submitted.
    
    Students are advised that though the professor takes grades very seriously, he nevertheless
    considers them to be of little importance compared to learning and thinking about the history,
    culture, and civilizations of the United States.   
    
    
    Office Hours: Office hour times are listed at the top of the first page of this syllabus.  If you
    cannot meet during posted times, see the instructor for an appointment.  Please note: In
    order to avoid interrupting students who come during office hours, the instructor will not
    receive phone calls during those times.  You can leave a message at any time by phoning and
    waiting for the voice mail system to activate.  Be sure to leave your phone number so your
    call may be returned if necessary.
    
    
    Other Items of Note:  
    
          1. Lectures and other course meetings are open only to students who are properly
          registered in HIST 202.  It is the responsibility of each student to verify such
          registration.  No unregistered person will be allowed to attend lectures or other course
          meetings without the written consent of the instructor.
    
          2. Lectures are provided for instructional purposes only and remain the intellectual
          property of the instructor.  Other uses are prohibited.  Lecture material is covered by
          copyright (Title 17 U.S. Code).  
    
          3. Lectures and other course meetings may not be tape recorded without the
          instructor's written consent.  Consent will be granted only in cases where the student
          is physically unable to take notes by hand.
    
          4. Students are expected to adhere to all the rules and regulations of Southern Oregon
          State College regarding conduct and academic honesty.  Students are advised that they
          have legal rights under Oregon law (see Sections 8 & 9 in "Winter and Spring Class
          Schedule.").
    
          5. Students must take care to avoid plagiarism (copying the words or ideas of others
          without giving proper credit to make them seem as if they are one's own).  The best
          way to avoid plagiarism is to put everything in your own words.  You may quote
          others, but you must surround their words with quote marks (or set them off in
          indented blocks), and you must indicate the source of the quote.  Quotes should be
          short, and they should be of such a character that rephrasing in one's own words
          would do injustice to the sense, significance, or impact of the projected quote. 
          Plagiarism is a form of academic dishonesty and will not be tolerated.

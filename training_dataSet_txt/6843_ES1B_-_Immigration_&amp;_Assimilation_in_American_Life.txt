COURSE     ORGANIZATION This course traces immigration to the United     States from the colonial era to the present with a special emphasis on issues     of assimilation, pluralism, and multiculturalism.  Evaluation will be     based on the following:  Participation in discussion section (25%), a     midterm exam in two parts (30%, 15% each part), four quizzes given during     the quarter (20%, 5% each), and a final exam (25%).  The quizzes will     be given unannounced during lecture during the quarter.  They will require     short answers to questions which will test your familiarity with the material     in lecture and the assigned readings.  Missed quizzes cannot be made     up under normal circumstances.

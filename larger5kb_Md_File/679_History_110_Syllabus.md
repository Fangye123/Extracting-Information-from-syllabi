Honor Code and Plagiarism:

Students are expected to observe the honor code. All work for this course must
be pledged. Students found to have cheated on an exam or to have plagiarized
material in a paper will be subject to the maximum penalty under college
rules. For those in doubt about the definition of plagiarism, it consists of
copying passages from a source without both attribution and quotation. If you
have reproduced the language of your source, you have committed plagiarism
whether or not you have cited the source and the page number. This includes
passages that a student may have modified: for example, changed verb tenses,
omission or replacement of occasional words, reshuffling of phrases, sentences
or paragraphs, combining of different plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper
in your own words is far better than writing a good one using the words of
someone else. One suggestion for avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts
and sources: close all books when writing, and consult them only for specific
facts or direct quotes. Also, proofread your paper with plagiarism
specifically in mind. For more on plagiarism, see the departmental style
sheet.

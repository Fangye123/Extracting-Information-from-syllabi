>  The history, theory, practice, and understanding of digital media, meant to
provide a foundation for integrating the relation of digital media to
contemporary culture, for understanding function, design, and use of
computers, and introducing students to fundamentals of quantitative analysis,
qualitative use of computing in the humanities, information search and
retrieval, and information presentation and design. Students should be
familiar with the fundamentals of PC use, including the basics of application
software and Internet use. Those in need of more extensive application
software skills are encouraged to take CS 110, or a concurrent ITC non-credit
workshop. MDST 110 is a requirement for the Media Studies major. (Two lectures
and one two-hour lab section per week)

> How can we think productively about popular media -- the industries that
produce it, the audiences that receive it, the representations circulated by
it, and the socio-cultural impact popular media has on the contemporary social
order? This course provides Media Studies majors with conceptual and
analytical tools for understanding how and why "media matters." We will
examine a number of different "schools" of thought about the impact of media
on society, and we will debate their uses, along with their strengths and
weaknesses. Some of the schools we will examine include the "culture and
civilization tradition," the "Frankfurt School," the American "media effects"
tradition, and the British "Cultural Studies" tradition. Within the Cultural
Studies tradition, we will examine its various emphases in ideological
critique, subcultural studies, and active audience analysis. We will also
explore questions of representation by looking at methodologies for examining
race and gender constructions in popular media. Finally, we will explore the
area of political economy of the media -- a school that focuses on questions
of media ownership and control. Assignments include readings, reports, a group
presentation, and a final paper.

>  34063 Mr. Bryan Pfaffenberger, section 0001(1700-1815 TR) CAB 130  
>  Prerequisites: ENWR 106, 110, or equivalent

>

> Using perspectives drawn from a variety of disciplines, this course examines
the challenges digital media pose to traditional conceptions of intellectual
property (specifically, copyrights and patents), and explores the measures
affected constituencies are using to cope with these challenges. The course
begins by examining the meaning and intent of the pertinent language in the
U.S. Constitution, explores the development of intellectual property law
during the Republic's history, and examines controversies over the challenges
posed to copyrights and patents by a variety of digital media, including the
Internet. Explored in detail are recent, controversial legislative acts (such
as the Digital Millennium Copyright Act) and court decision (such as the U.S.
Federal Circuit Court's State Street Decision) that greatly enlarge the
privileges of copyright and patent holders.

> **MDST 323 American Science Fiction** (3 credits)  
>  33956 Mr. Phillip Gochenour, section 0001 (1700-1815 MW), Clemons 322-A

>

> American Science Fiction has existed as an established genre since at least
the days of Buck Rogers, but in the post-WWII era, spurred on by a belief in
the dawning of a new technological age, it emerged as a major forum for
technology-based social and political theory. In this course, we will read a
number of major works from the late 1950s up to the 1990s, placing them in
relation to American culture and tracing the geneaology of American science
fiction from the logical faith of Isaac Asimov to the pessimism of the
cyberpunks. Authors will include Asimov, Heinlein, Bradbury, Pynchon, Dick,
Vinge, Gibson, and Stephenson, among others, as well as short critical essays
and documents pertaining to the cultural milieu of these works.

> **MDST 344 Aesthetics of Games** (3 credits)  
>  33985 Ms. Bethany Nowviskie, Ms. Andrea Laue, section 0001 (930-1115 TR),
Clemons 322-A

>

> Guiding Questions: Are games aesthetic artifacts warranting the sustained
attention and critical investigation that we devote to works of literature,
visual art, film or music? How do media affect gaming and play? Do games
mediate player experience in new ways? What are the design issues particular
to computerized games? What are the relevant genres in gaming, and how do
concepts of genre affect consumption and design? How do we understand the
social and cultural impact of games? What's the relationship between gender
and gaming? Can we come to terms with game play and game design as practices
involving subjectivity, interactivity, intellect, and art?

>

> We will begin with central readings in Media Studies, ergodics, and
interactivity, and make an analogy between the status of gaming studies and
early attitudes toward the novel and motion picture. Other readings will stem
from aesthetics, narratology, game theory, and the philosophy of play.
Finally, students will analyze gaming industry media, in the form of
production manuals and design manifestos, consumer gaming magazines, and the
growing body of best-practices literature by and for game companies. Students
will produce abstracts of readings and notes for discussion, a game review for
a popular periodical of their choice, a literary or art-critical analysis of a
game, and (working in teams) a substantial proposal/ design document for an
original game concept. Class will generally run as a discussion group
punctuated by "play days" in which students will demo games and lead critical
conversations. ([more information](http://toolkit.virginia.edu/cgi-

>  33035 Ms. Renate Voris, section 0001 (TR 1400-1515), Clemons 201

>

> The goals of the seminar are threefold: (1) to introduce ourselves to
semiotic and cinematic analysis, the assumption being that film is a LANGUAGE
(whether it is also an ART is a question we may leave open); (2) to discuss
larger theoretical and methodological issues, especially (since we're dealing
with a visual medium) the construction of cinematic spectatorship and that
elusive notion of feminist film theory, the "male" and "female" gaze. For that
exploration, we will need psychoanalysis, which in turn will help us address
such complex questions as the relation between cinema, sexuality, and the
unconscious, cinema and voyeurism, cinema, fetishism, and politics; (3) to
inquire into the (historical) question of technological innovations in shaping
film history and film theory. No prerequisites except for a love of "movies."
Materials for viewing and analysis will be selected from both American and
continental filmmakers (e.g. Alfred Hitchcock,Fritz Lang, Jean-Luc Godard,
Jane Campion). PLEASE NOTE: ATTENDANCE AT MONDAY EVENING FILM SCREENINGS IS
MANDATORY.

>

> This course examines the American film and television industries in the
1960s and early 1970s with particular attention to the ways in which these
popular culture industries responded to the turbulent social change movements
of the period. How does popular mass-mediated entertainment negotiate with
political and social movements that challenge the dominant social order? This
course will provide a comparative analysis of two institutions: the Hollywood
motion picture industry and the American network television industry in order
to examine the larger issue of what role popular culture plays in the process
of social transformation. We will examine popular media representations of:
the civil rights/black power movements; the hippie counterculture; the anti-
war movement; the student movement; the Vietnam war; and the women's
liberation movement. The course will also examine how films and television
texts can be studied as historical documents that can tell us something of the
complexities of previous eras. We will also examine the politics of nostalgia
and the ways that the past gets rewritten in particular ways for social and
political considerations of the present. Assignments include two essays and
one group web-creation project. (Two lectures and a mandatory screening
session each week.)

> Admission is by permission of instructor and completion of ENWR 270.
Students will develop a semester-long in-depth study on a particular subject
of current news value. The project will require considerable research and
analysis, aggressive interviewing, and serious editing. In addition, there
will be shorter News writing assignments during the semester. Total enrollment
limited to 15. Satisfies second writing requirement.

> **MDST 381 Independent Study in Media Studies** (3 credits)  
>  33936 Ms. Johanna Drucker, section 0001 (TBA)  
>  PERMISSION OF INSTRUCTOR REQUIRED

>

> This course is designed to allow students to pursue guided independent study
of a topic that is not contained within the course offerings of Media Studies.
Students wishing to pursue a guided study must prepare a syllabus and reading
list in consultation with a faculty member or the Director of the Media
Studies Program. They should be very explicit about the milestones for
assessment during the semester's work. The reading list and assignments should
be comparable to those in any other 300-level course for Media Studies and
terms for midterm and final grade evaluation on the basis of papers and final
projects should be formalized at the time the student begins the course.
Intermediate and advanced students have found this a particularly useful way
to study an area in depth that cannot be accommodated in the course offerings
of the program. In general, the more focused the proposal, the greater the
likelihood of approval. Students may not use this course to substitute for
core courses in the major, though in some cases this may count as a primary
elective for credit towards the major requirements, on approval of the
Director of the Program.

>  PERMISSION OF INSTRUCTOR REQUIRED

>

> This is an opportunity for a limited number of students to receive credit
while gaining hands-on experience with New Media while working on the Virginia
Center for Digital History (VCDH) Lewis and Clark digital history project.
Students who register for MDST 382 will have the opportunity to learn how to
conduct historical research, mark up text, create a database, and develop
dynamic presentations from their findings under supervision of a faculty
member. Topics of inquiry might include, but are not limited to the following
themes: the relationship between environment and history, early nineteenth-
century Virginia material culture, the cartographic imagination of Thomas
Jefferson and his contemporaries, the expedition's encounters with American
Indians, and Lewis and Clark in American memory and commemoration. Students
will discuss and develop their own topic through regular meetings with the
instructor and produce a research paper that integrates both the needs of the
Lewis and Clark digital history project and the Media Studies major. Please
contact Douglas Seefeldt at 243-7707, or seefeldt@virginia.edu for more

> **MDST 411 Distributed Communities** (3 credits)  
>  31045 Mr. Phillip Gochenour, section 0001 (1400-1515 MW), Clemons 322-A  
>

>

> In the world of computer mediated communications, no concept is perhaps so
controversial as that of the "virtual community" \-- while some argue that
MUDs, email lists, and other forms of single-to-many and many-to-many
communication represent new possibilities for creating and developing
communities, others argue that these amount to little more than "interest
groups" that lack the "necessary commitment" to be found in "true"
communities. In this course we will draw upon materials from a variety of
disciplines, including the history of computer mediated communications,
sociology, and post-Structuralist social theory, among others, to examine the
concept of community, the linkage between "virtual communities" and other
community forms such as nomadism, the types of subjects who populate these
communities, and the mechanisms by which these communities determine  
>  and regulate social order.

>

> This course engages with problems of interpretation specific to visual
images. Readings will draw on a range of disciplines: art history (and
traditional iconographical study, connoisseurship, and formal analysis),
design theory, psychology, cognitive science, and semiotics. The goal of the
class is to provide a foundation for critical interpretation of visual
materials, not to simply survey the literature. Close study of individual
images and self-consciousness about the frameworks of intepretation will be
central to the class activity.

>  What's unusual about this course is that it will be taught from
Charlottesville (in English) using real-time, interactive videoconferencing
technology at the University of Virginia's School of Continuing and
Professional Studies and broadcast to undergraduate students at Istanbul
Technical University, Turkey's oldest and largest engineering school. The
course will consist of 40 students: 20 in Istanbul and 20 in Charlottesville,
equally divided into engineering and non-engineering students in both
locations. At UVA, the course is cross-listed as a Media Studies elective and
TCC elective.  
>  
>  Few issues are more central to the futures of mature and evolving
democracies than guaranteeing freedom of speech and institutionalizing
politically independent, competitive media--print, broadcast, cable, and now
the Internet. The role of the state is of course fundamental in securing and
protecting--or limiting and threatening--free speech and independent media.
Broadly speaking (and historically), the creation and development of a public
sphere of civil society, relatively autonomous from the state, is a crucial
precondition for extensive democratization. Today, modern media (whatever
their shortcomings) are among the most important social institutions for
shaping and sustaining the public sphere, and thus for promoting--or impeding
--democratization. Turkey and the United States are obviously now in different
phases of democratization and evolution of a vigorous public sphere. This
course will focus, historically and contemporaneously, on the role of media in
Turkey and the U. S. in shaping an evolving public sphere and democratic
process. It will be built around a set of core and common readings, lots of
student interaction and dialogue, perhaps even a Turkish-American team
project, and guest lecturers from the participating universities.

>  Introduction to Media Studies introduces students to the topics, themes,
and areas of study that are central to an understanding of media in
contemporary society. The course provides a foundation for work in the Media
Studies major, and also serves as a stand-alone introduction to media for non-
majors. It is intended to prepare students to take more focused classes in
film history and criticism, digital technology, broadcasting and television,
media and cultural theory, and the design and development of new media.
Introduction to Media Studies will emphasize three basic lines of
investigation: Aesthetics of Media, Media Institutions and Defamiliarizing
Media. Introduction to Media Studies is in lecture format. Students should be
prepared for a heavy reading load, encompassing a wide variety of difficult
texts, as well as a number of short assignments, two short papers, and two
exams. MDST 201 is a requirement for the Media Studies major.

>  This course will address the role the media has played in creating images
and understandings of "Africa" and "Blackness" in this country. We will focus
primarily on the context of the present-day United States. However, we will
also briefly address pre-colonial and colonial periods and touch on the role
of popular media in particular contemporary African contexts. This class will
explore how different media, including feature films, popular television,
documentaries, popular fiction, academic writing, and radio, television, and
print news media create "Africa" in different ways for Americans - each media
encapsulating its own markers of legitimacy and expertise - each negotiating
its own ideas of authorship and audience. Students will collect examples each
week from various sources (print, television, film, etc.) for discussion. We
will concentrate on the particular ways various media produce, display, and
disseminate information. Finally, we will ask what responsibilities those who
create and circulate information about such a mis- and under-represented area
of the world have - and whether or not the viewing public shares in any sort
of responsibility. Students will assemble a twenty-page portfolio/research
paper.

> **MDST 354: Media and the Mythic West** (3 credits)  
>  10344 Mr. Douglas Seefeldt, section 0001 (1400-1515 MW, CAB B020)  
>  
>  When most people think of the American West the first things that come to
mind are dramatic images of cowboys, Indians, outlaws, and sublime landscapes.
These stereotypical icons are most often constructed from some basis in fact
by mass and popular media, and have been defined and refined over generations
in American culture and thought. Literature, painting, photography, and
journalism began to establish popular mythic characteristics of the West in
the mid-nineteenth century. The particular imagery created by authors such as
Owen Wister and Zane Grey, and visual artists like Frederic Remington and
Charles Russell, reached wide audiences both at home and abroad throughout the
early twentieth century. During much of this past century, the mediums of
film, music, radio, and television have offered new ways to interpret the
meaning of the West. Classic 1950s western films The Gunfighter, Shane, and
High Noon suggest that filmmakers found the mythic West to be an ideal setting
for contemporary morality plays treating pressing social issues. In this
course we will investigate the history of media and the mythic West, examining
the content of western-themed art, photography, journalism, fiction, popular
and folk music, film, radio, and television. The objectives of this course
include developing the skills used in analyzing media sources, reading and
evaluating the analytical works of others, and communicating one's own ideas
in speech and writing. Course readings will amount to approximately 80-100
pages a week, and students will view some assigned materials outside of class.
Assessment will be based on a midterm, a final, a series of 2-3 page written
assignments, one 8-10 page essay, and active participation in discussions and
in-class activities.

>  This course examines the American film and television industries in the
1960s and early 1970s with particular attention to the ways in which these
popular culture industries responded to the turbulent social changes of the
period. How does popular mass-mediated entertainment negotiate with political
and social movements that challenge the dominant social order? This course
will provide a comparative analysis of two institutions: the Hollywood motion
picture industry and the American network television industry in order to
examine the larger issue of what role popular culture plays in the process of
social transformation. The course will also examine how films and television
texts can be studied as historical documents that can tell us something of the
complexities of previous eras. We will also examine the politics of nostalgia
and the way that the past gets rewritten in particular ways for social and
political considerations of the present.

>  
>  This course will focus on the elements and considerations that factor into
documentary productions, including aspects dealing with theory, ethics,
planning, execution and technology. Students will come to understand that even
in documentary production there are numerous premeditated choices that must be
made that will effect a the overall tone, content, and appearance of a
project. In addition to readings and screenings outside of class, students
will shoot and edit three small video projects in order to gain some
production experience that we can apply to our classroom discussions on issues
in documentary production. The emphasis will be on the production process, not
the end product.  
>  
>  A basic knowledge of the computer program, Final Cut Pro, is extremely
useful, but not required. It is suggested that students who register for the
class stop by the Digital Media Lab in the Robertson Media Center of Clemons
Library prior to class, and arrange for a walk-through of the program, just to
gain familiarity with its features.

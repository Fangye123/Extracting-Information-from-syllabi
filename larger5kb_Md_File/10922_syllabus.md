## History of Religion in America

Summer Term, 2002  
Professor Samuel Pearson

This course is a survey of the character and role of religious institutions,
ideas, and practices in American history. The primary text is _Pilgrims_ _in_
_Their_ _Own_ _Land_ by Martin E. Marty. This volume will provide a structure
for the course and a general introduction to the topic. Supplementary essays
will be assigned from _Religion in American History_ by Jon Butler and Harry
S. Stout. Both of these volumes are available in textbook rental. Lectures
will complement text and discussion items and address other aspects of the
course topic.

The focus of this course is on the history of religion understood in the
broadest sense of that term and on its cultural and social as well as cultic,
theological, and institutional dimensions. The objective of the course is to
enable students to increase their understanding of the actual functions of
religion in American society as well as their knowledge of major historical
figures and events in American religion. Students completing the course should
have an understanding of the major religious traditions that have influenced
the development of American history as well as the ways in which church and
state have related through history. They should be able to give a coherent
explanation of the historical development of religious ideas, institutions,
and practices from the colonial era to the present time. They should know
something about the history and characteristics of religious movements such as
Adventism, Catholicism, civil religion, creation science, ecumenism,
evangelicalism, fundamentalism, Judaism, modernism, Mormonism, Native American
religion, Orthodoxy, pentecostalism, pietism, primitivism, Protestantism,
Puritanism, rationalism, transcendentalism, and utopianism. They will be
expected to have at least a passing knowledge of the ways in which American
religions and American history have shaped one another and of explanations for
American characteristics that reveal religious influences.

Students are expected to complete all assigned readings in order to understand
the lectures and participate in the classroom discussions. Two examinations
will be scheduled. Each student will present a review and critique of an essay
from _Religion in American History_ in class and then submit her or his review
in writing. A second written review will also be required. Grades will be
determined on the basis of hour and final examinations (35% each), class
presentation (10%), and papers (10% each). Grades on papers will be lowered if
the papers are submitted late. Students are expected to be present for class
meetings except when excused. Up to three one-hour absences will be excused;
beyond that number, each hourly absence will lower the course grade by 1%.

The class meets on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 8:00 to 10:50 am in
PH3313. My office is in Peck Hall, room 0216, my telephone extension is 3570,
and my e-mail address is spearso@siue.edu or pearsonsm@earthlink.net. My
office hours are from 10:50 to 11:30 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday and by
appointment. Students should contact me promptly if they are experiencing
difficulties. Please do not leave messages on my office telephone; it is
shared by many faculty, and I may not receive all such messages. E-mail is far
more reliable.

Format for Papers

Your papers should be written carefully with appropriate attention both to
content and to style. I expect you to read the assigned essays in the Butler
and Stout volume as well as others distributed in class carefully. As you
read, look up any terms you do not understand. Also outline each article and
be sure you understand the author's main points. Then write a review in which
you make clear the point of view of the author as well as how the author's
views are complemented or challenged by information in the textbook or the
lectures. How does the author argue for her or his position? What do you
consider to be the strengths and weaknesses of this position and why? Each of
your papers should be at least three double-spaced, typewritten pages; but
none should exceed six pages in length. Above all, if you have questions, ask.
I do not expect perfection, but I do expect careful attention to historical
detail and to the mechanics of composition. If you do not understand basic
rules of scholarly writing, familiarize yourself with the relevant chapters in
Kate Turabian's _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and
Dissertations._

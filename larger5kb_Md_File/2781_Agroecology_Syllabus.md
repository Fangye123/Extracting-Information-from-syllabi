**Textbook:** | _The Real Dirt: Farmers Tell about Organic and Low-Input
Practices in the Northeast. _ Miranda Smith (ed.) SARE. 1994  
**Course Description and Objectives:**  
As a student in this course you are expected to develop an agricultural
ecosystem perspective and an understanding of design for agricultural systems.
I want you to gain an understanding of the principles, concepts, and practices
central to systems of sustainable agriculture. Material that we will cover
includes: evolution of our thinking and a historical perspective, basic
concepts of plant/soil ecosystems, design principles, examination of specific
sustainable systems, economic issues, and problem solving.

Along with developing your thinking you will have an opportunity this semester
to develop skills in giving professional presentations. Unlike some activities
you experience in academia (receiving lecturing, taking exams, etc), learning
how to be team players, critical thinkers, autonomous learners and effective
communicators are skills that will serve you the rest of your life.

Course activities consist of: team and individual teaching in the classroom
with discussions and activities; critical thinking to solve problems;
thoughtful in class writings on the readings (quizzes); and an
agroecologically design team project and presentation.

**Course Requirements and Expectations:**  
It is important that you **attend all our scheduled classroom time**. Your
participation is essential. The discussions we have, the questions raised, and
the learning exercises you participate in are all fundamental aspects of your
learning experience in this course.

It is extremely important that you **complete assigned reading and exercises
before the class** covering this material. Team teachers will present info and
design exercises to expand on the important concepts you have read in your
texts, clarify the issues, and inspire you to seek out a greater understand of
the material. Reading your assignments provides you with a foundation of
understanding that we build on in class, which allows you to also interpret
and relate information, and ask questions. Readings will be assigned the
previous week. A copy of our textbook is on 2 hour reserve in Bailey/Howe.

As a course participant, you are expected to attend all sessions, complete
your readings and other assignments on time, and participate in discussions
and other activities. All late assignments will receive only partial credit.
You should expect to loose at least one letter grade for each day assignments
are late. As a participant in the team activities you are expected to be a
team member and help your team accomplish its goals by meeting regularly,
being on time, doing your share of the work, doing it well, and in a timely
manner.

**Course Grading:**  
We hope to provide you with an environment that stimulates your thinking
processes, allows for successful learning, growth and development, and the
enjoyment in the discovery of new ideas. Since you must be graded on your
development, learning and discovery, you will be graded on your participation,
thoughtful in class writings on the readings (quizzes), team teaching
presentations, individual presentation and team design projects.

**Grading System:**   | 10% Class participation, effort, attitude, attendance  
---|---  
15% Thoughtful in class writings (quizzes) on the Readings  
20% Team Presentations  
40% Agroecology Project:  | 5% Peer Review  
10% Presentation  
25% Written Project  
15% Individual Presentation  
**Academic Honesty:**  
Honesty is all aspects of your academic and professional life is central to
the meaning of the university, to the life of a professional, and to personal
relationships between colleagues and friends. We expect you to follow the code
of academic honesty set by this institution in the work that you submit to us
for this class. I encourage you to review the UVM Academic Honesty Policy in
the current Cat's Tale. If you are having problems preparing and completing
assignments, please talk with us. We are here to help you, and we want you to
succeed!

**Specific Course Learning Exercises:**  
**Thoughtful In class Writings (Quizzes) on the Reading:** To help you keep up
with the reading, we will take the first 15 minutes of class time to have you
thoughtfully write the answers to some questions on the reading assignments.
We do not want you to memorize the readings. We want you to read it, think
about it, and maybe make thoughtful preparatory comments for yourself. We hope
you will to develop your ability to think critically with this exercise, be
prepared for class, and keep up with the reading. Your readings will be
assigned in class the week before by the team that will be presenting at the
next class.

There will be twelve thoughtful in class writing assignments (quizzes). You
must complete all 12 writings. We will keep your 10 best to calculate your
final score. The evaluation will be based on how well you answer the question,
your thoughtfulness and creativity.

**Team Teaching Presentations:** The very best way to learn anything is to
teach it to someone else. If you do this activity in the form of a group
presentation that includes stimulating and fun exercises that involves your
classmates you are an effective communicator. We will evaluate each
presentation, based on quality, effectiveness, and creativity. Please see the
materials we have developed on giving an effective presentation.

We will study 8 different ways to approach agroecosystems. As a team you will
have one and one-half hours to cover your topic. We want you to teach us about
your topic by presenting info on it, and then to design an exercise that will
stimulate our thinking, and involve the class. Here are some basic guidelines:

1) Every team member should be involved in presenting information.  
2) You may present information for 45 mins.  
3) Your discussion exercise(s) to stimulate thinking and interaction should be
30 mins.  
4) Reading **must** be assigned to the class one week before you teach.  
5) You must schedule time with me to review your presentation.

Each teaching team should cover the following information:  
1\. Define what your system of ag is  
2\. Present relevant history  
3\. Define the paradigm (thinking, perspective or model) people use when
following this system  
4\. Present key principles of this type of Ag to help us understand it  
5\. Present practices that are specific to this type of ag  
6\. Present regulations or guideline that must be followed to be "legally"
classified as this type of ag  
7\. What societal issues can this type of ag address? What is its value and
limits to food production, environmental issues, economics and the quality of
life for rural people and communities?

**Individual Presentations:** Each student will also give an individual
presentation on a specific topic related to the systems of sustainable ag we
study. We want these individual presentations to help us learn the common
threads of the more technical side of sustainable ag methods. Topics can
include: rotations, IPM, cover-cropping, using biological cycles to manage
soil fertility, weeds, diseases or insects, inter-cropping, reduced tillage
systems to reduce erosion, efficient irrigation, rotational grazing, using
compost, alternative energy systems, and appropriate technology. Please see
the materials we have developed on giving an effective presentation.

You will have **15 minutes** for your individual presentation, **including
time for questions and answers**. You may use slides or the over-head
projector to help you explain your topic. We will evaluate each presentation,
based on quality, effectiveness, and creativity. Please schedule some time
with me to review your presentation before you give it. Reading to the class
**must** be assigned one week in the class before you teach.

**Agroecology Project:** The course team project will give you the opportunity
to apply agroecological principles to a plant/animal/people system in your
area of interest. Your group will design a sustainable agriculture system for
a real situation. Options for this project include designing for various
homesteads, farms, and edible landscaping. Please be in communication with us
about what type of project your group wants to do. We have some contacts, but
you can develop your own.

Your team may design a project for **any** real life agroecological situation
that interests you. The **one requirement across the board for all projects**
is that it must be feasible to complete your project in one semester. You will
have 30 minutes of each class period to meet and discuss your projects. Please
be prepared to be productive. Please see additional materials prepared for you
on your project.

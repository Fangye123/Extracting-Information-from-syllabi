**** The goal of this course is to expose you to the history of Europe from
Antiquity to the Renaissance and Reformation. While acquainting you with major
political, social and cultural developments, this course focuses on close
reading and interpretation of primary sources to teach you basic analytical
skills historians use to evaluate the past.

Paper topics will be distributed in class. The Midterm Exam will be given in
class. The Participation grade evaluates your contributions during sections
and when appropriate, during lectures, fulfillment of homework assignments,
contributions to in-class group projects, and attendance patterns.

****

Attendance during lectures and sections is mandatory. If you miss sections
more than three times without explanations, or if you do not attend lectures
on a regular basis, you will forfeit the 15% credit for class participation.
Discussion of primary sources is an integral part of this class. Do the
readings carefully and come to class prepared to discuss them. If questions
about the readings are handed out in advance, you need to be prepared to
discuss these as well. Your written work _must_ represent _your own_ thinking.
Students who submit plagiarized, or unattributed, work of others will fail the
course.

If you have any questions about the material we are reading or any
difficulties keeping up with the course requirements, please see me or your
teaching assistant during office hours or by appointment. If you have a
disability that requires accomodation, please let me or your teaching
assistant know.

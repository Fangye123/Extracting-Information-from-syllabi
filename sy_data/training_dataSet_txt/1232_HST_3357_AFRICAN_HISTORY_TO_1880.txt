Course Outline and Format
This course will introduce students
    to the history of Africa , concentrating on Sub-Saharan Africa, and will serve as a
    survey. During the course of the semester several themes will be explored, examined and
    discussed. Each student should come out of this course having a general background to
    African history, and with some knowledge of issues they might further want to explore.
    Among the issues and themes to be encountered, will be diversity of African culture,
    medieval African empires, African contact with Europe, slavery and the slave trade, and
    New World settlements in Africa. The course will take a thematic and chronological
    approach and students will be exposed to different viewpoints. Though the course will be
    biased in favor of Sub-Saharan Africa, the history of other parts of Africa will also be
    touched upon. 
 
 
Course Requirements
A midterm paper (30%), final paper
    (30%), quizzes (20%), and weekly class participation and attendance (20%) will make up the

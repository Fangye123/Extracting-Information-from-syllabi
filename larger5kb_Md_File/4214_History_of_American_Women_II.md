Course Reader

**Course Description:**

This course examines women and gender relations from the Civil War to the
present. Among other things, we shall seek to understand how women's lives
have changed from the nineteenth-century to today; understand the diversity of
women's class, racial, and ethnic identities and how these identities
influence their relationships with other women; compare women's actual
behavior to prescriptive definitions of female roles and personalities and
other stereotypes; develop historical skills necessary for analyzing primary
and secondary sources.

Engaged and informed participation in the class is essential.

**Course Requirements:**

Writing Assignments (60% of grade):

Students will complete three 6-8 page essays on assigned topics. Topics for
the first two papers will be handed out approximately ten days in advance and
will be due on the following dates:

Monday, March 8

Wednesday, April 7

The third essay will be an historiographical essay written on one theme. The
essay is due on the day the class holds discussion on the topic on which the
paper is written. I will provide more information about writing an
historiographical essay, but I encourage students to come see me during the
preparation of this third essay:

Topics Due Date

Sexuality and Modernity February 19

Women, Work, and Families in the Great Depression March 22

Sapphire and Mommie Dearest April 28

**Discussion (20% of grade):**

Students are expected to participate regularly in student-lead class
discussions. Each member of the class will lead a class discussion. Discussion
leaders are encouraged to meet with me during the week prior to the discussion
to prepare. Students will sign up to lead discussions in the first week of
classes. Students will be evaluated based on the regularity and significance
of their classroom discussion.

Students who anticipate difficulties speaking in class should come see me
immediately, so that we can up with strategies to overcome these
apprehensions.

**Final (20% of grade):**

##### Overview

This course will explore issues of moral leadership in the Vietnam War Era
through film, fiction, song, memoir and journalistic accounts of the war. It
will focus on two themes:

(1) The first is moral decision-making--on the battlefield, at the highest
levels of national leadership, and within the hearts and minds of young
Americans deciding whether to go to war or to oppose it.

(2) The second issue is the representation and cultural construction of the
war--the way in which American society drastically altered its view of the
success, utility and morality of the war and its leaders over time.

With the ongoing war in Afghanistan, both these themes should take on a new
resonance, and we will explore the ways in which our nation's Vietnam
experiences are relevant to the current war.

Many of your parents had their lives changed and their worldviews formed
either as soldiers in the war or as participants in the anti-war movement at
home. Many of your parents had friends or relatives killed or wounded in the
war. Millions of Vietnamese and 58,000 Americans died in the war. At the level
of national leadership, the prosecution of the war raised profound issues of
moral leadership. On the ground in Vietnam, choices about moral leadership
were made every single day by thousands of people.

Furthermore, legions of journalists, historians, novelists, poets, song-
writers and film-makers have created their own views of the war in non-fiction
accounts or art. So the Vietnam War is fertile territory for learning not only
about leadership and its moral dimensions, but also about the representation
of the war and its leadership in journalism, film, fiction and memoir. As the
war advanced over 10 years, and in the years after it ended, American society
changed its view of the war, and this was both conditioned by and reflected in
the way reporters, writers and filmmakers viewed and represented the war and
its leaders.

Additionally, Americans and Vietnamese viewed the same leadership--whether Ho
Chi Minh or the Green Berets--very differently indeed. Although most of our
reading and viewing will focus on work by Americans, we will read some
material by Vietnamese writers to help us get a different perspective on the
war. It may be the most important perspective of all.

This is not a history course. We will not attempt to cover systematically the
history of the war, although I will recommend some history books to you if you
would like to do additional reading. Also, in class I will be giving you
historical context for the works we will be studying. I welcome into our
discussions your own expertise, knowledge and experience.

During most weeks of the course you will be expected to write a two-page paper
on that week's reading or film. You will be expected to participate actively
in class discussion. This is very important for the development of your own
ideas and to contribute to the education of your classmates.

What is the highest goal of this class? Informed by scholarship and the ideas
of your classmates, you will think deeply about the Vietnam War and its
meaning for our nation today. In so doing, you will examine your own beliefs
about war and peace, about other cultures and peoples, and about our nation's
foreign policy. You will think deeply as well about our nation's current war
in Afghanistan, about the challenges that our nation's foreign policy present
to your own conscience, and about how you will participate in building a more
just society in your local community, in America, and in the world.

I expect this class to be both rigorous and fun for all of us. I expect the
class to stimulate and challenge each of us intellectually, emotionally and
morally. As I do this work with you, I expect to have a lot of fun.

##### Required Texts

The reading for this course will be from required texts, e-reserves and
Internet sites. The following (listed in approximately the order we will be
reading them) is a list of texts which you will need to purchase. They are
available at the Regulator Bookshop, 720 Ninth St.

The Vietnam Reader, ed. by Stewart O'Nan  
Born on the Fourth of July by Ron Kovic  
The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien  
The Sorrow of War by Bao Ninh  
Dispatches by Michael Herr  
The Living and the Dead by Paul Hendrickson  
My Lai: A Brief History with Documents, ed. by James S. Olson and Randy
Roberts

#####  
Required Film Viewing

There are five films you are required to see for this course. Most of them
will be available to you in two different ways. Most will be shown on a
specified date listed below on a "big screen" on campus. Each will be on
reserve at Lilly Library. You are required to see at least three of these
films on the big screen on the dates listed below. (Place of screening TBA.)

Film Date of screening Title  
The Green Berets Jan. 16  
The Deerhunter Jan. 29  
Apocalypse Now Feb. 27  
Hearts and Minds March 19  
Platoon April 10  

##### Special Events

Speakers in class: To be announced.

Dinner and class at my house: You are invited to my house for dinner and class
on Sunday evening, March 24 at 6:00. I'll provide all the food and drink.

  
Dialogue with a Vietnam-Era Participant

As noted briefly above, each of you will be expected to interview someone
active in the Vietnam Era--either a veteran, member of the anti-war movement
or Vietnamese refugee. You will be responsible for finding this person and
setting up the interview(s) with him or her. You will also write up the
results of your interview(s) and discussion(s) in a paper of approximately
five pages in length. I will help you develop questions for them and discuss
your write-up with you.

Although you will not be expected to present the results of your discussions
formally in class, you will undoubtedly find that your interview gives you
good new information and perspectives to add to our class discussion and to
your writing.

##### Grading

Grades in this course will be based on the following:

Class participation: 35%  
Weekly text-response papers: 35%  
Write-up of interview with Vietnam-Era participant: 10%  
Final paper: 20%

The text-response papers and final papers are described below. I will respond
individually to each of your papers; but you will not be graded on individual
papers. Rather, you will be graded on your text-response papers as a group.
I'll be evaluating the quality and deepening of your work throughout the
semester.

I will meet individually with each of you at mid-semester to give you a mid-
semester grade and evaluation of your work.

##### Course Requirements

* Attend all classes and the required number of films. Be on time.

* Complete all the reading assignments each week before Tuesday's class (unless   
otherwise indicated in the syllabus and class calendar below). Be prepared to
talk about the reading.

* Bring me a copy of each text-response paper (about two pages) on the following class dates: Jan. 15, 22; Feb. 5, 12, 19, 26; March 5, 26; April 2\. All of these dates are Tuesdays.

* Write a paper of about five pages on your interview(s) with a Vietnam-Era   
participant. This paper will be due Thursday, April 11, but it would be great
if you want to give it to me earlier.

* Write a final research essay of roughly 12-20 pages to be due near the end of the   
semester. I will ask you to get approval for your topic from me, and I will
have topics to suggest as well if you need that help. These final essays
should illuminate some of the issues we have studied in class. They should
each be on a topic relating to moral leadership in the Vietnam War Era, a
topic which especially appeals to you. The essays should certainly call on
what you have learned in class, but they should go beyond this class with
significant additional research of your own. I am looking for a terrific,
substantial piece of work here, and I will work closely with members of the
class as necessary as you pick your topic and do your research and writing.

* Participate actively in our discussions in class. This doesn't mean you need to talk more than anyone else. It does mean that every student needs to contribute to deepening our conversation about moral leadership during the war. Expect to say something valuable every class. If you're shy about speaking in class, I'll help you.

##### Guidance for text-response papers

What are your thoughts and ideas about this week's text-the film or reading
(or both)? What are the ethical and cultural issues raised, and how do you
respond to them? That's what I want from the reading- and film-response papers
which should be about two pages in length. As the semester progresses, you'll
be able to relate earlier readings and films and class discussions to the
texts for the current week in the papers that you write. I am interested in
your reflective response to the various people and issues we study in relation
to your own life and to the events of our time.

I'm also interested in your response to the way in which the authors and
filmmakers-in both works of fiction and non-fiction--represent the leaders
they portray. What points of view do you detect in their portraits of these
people, and how does that matter? Do you agree or disagree? What points do you
find most compelling, most interesting, most challenging? Don't feel the need
to discuss every aspect of the reading or film. Rather, you may well want to
pick out one salient aspect of the text and focus extensively on that.

Many weeks we will be reading several short pieces by different authors, or we
might be reading a piece of fiction, say, and seeing a film that same week. If
so, please feel free to compare and contrast them, to write about their
interplay and the ideas that interplay sparked in your own mind.

I do want you to use your creativity in these papers, but I also want each of
them to be closely related to the text you are discussing, to demonstrate that
you are coming to grips with the text in some important way. I am looking for
original, challenging thought and excellent writing on a coherent thesis
closely related to the texts.

I may, at times, share portions of your paper with the class by reading them
aloud.

Early Childhood Education

The early childhood education major combines theoretical components with
practical application. Students in this degree program will have extensive
clinical experiences in the community and in local schools
(prekindergarten/primary, age three to grade three). An emphasis is placed on
the appropriate uses of technology. The program design incorporates all newly
required competencies leading to certification in the state of Florida in the
area of prekindergarten/primary, age three to grade three. These courses meet
the stated requirements for Florida certification. At this time, the Florida
Department of Education is considering this sequence of courses for program
approval status. Courses are designed to be taken in a specific sequence.
Please note: the early childhood education major courses are offered only on
the main campus in the evening. The generic course syllabi are available for
students to download. While instructors are not permitted to delete any
requirements of the course, an instructor may add to the course syllabus.

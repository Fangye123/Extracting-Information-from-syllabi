### CATALOG DESCRIPTION

Through current and historical cases this course explores issues about
experiment, discovery, and application in science and technology; the
professional, social and moral issues to which these give rise; and more
general themes about critical and creative thinking in science and technology.
Implications of this study for science teaching and citizen activism are
discussed.  
  

### DESCRIPTION of the theme for Spring 2002: Environment, Science & Society

Critical thinking about diverse influences that shape environmental science
and practices, giving particular attention to the tension between simple and
complex accounts of environmental and social change. The course material,
activities, and teaching/learning interactions provides students an
opportunity to learn new science and new approaches to interpreting science, a
set of models for their own teaching and educational work, and a basis for
discussions and reflection about practices and philosophies of education. The
topics addressed in the activities include ideas of nature; conservation and
colonialism; systems thinking; population growth and futures modeling; the
tragedy of the commons; stability and complexity; environmental economics;
local knowledge; commodities and environmental history; agriculture and
biotechnology; and socio-environmental analysis.

### COURSE OBJECTIVES

  
This course is designed to prepare graduate students to addresss the following
goals as formal and informal environmental educators. **Thoughtful and
responsive** environmental **educators** should, ideally, challenge and enable
their students to:  
* learn facts and theories about environmental processes and problems;  
* develop skills in critical thinking, interpretation, inquiry, and writing;  
* express their feelings about prospects for the environment and society, and their desired impact on these areas;  
* be inspired by positive examples, cases that are constructive, successful, and on-going;  
* be actively involved as citizens in scientific and environmental debates;  
* gain experience in designing proposals, policy, and plans for action in the wider arenas of politics, policy making, informed citizenship, and social activism;  
* bridge the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences;  
* clarify their choice of more specialized studies to pursue; and  
* achieve a growing sense of competency.  
  
The course material, activities, and teaching/learning interactions operate on
three levels:  
* as an opportunity for students to learn science and approaches to interpreting science;   
* as models for their own teaching and educational work; and   
* as a basis for discussions and reflection about practices and philosophies of education.   
  
The particular approach adopted in the course is to focus on **critical
thinking** about the diverse influences shaping environmental science and
practices. In a sense subscribed to by all teachers, critical thinking means
that students are bright and engaged, ask questions, and think about the
course materials until they understand well established knowledge and
competing approaches. This becomes more significant when students develop
their own processes of active inquiry, which they can employ in new
situations, beyond the bounds of our particular classes, indeed, beyond their
time as students. My sense of critical thinking is, however, more specific; it
depends on inquiry being informed by a strong sense of how things could be
otherwise. I want students to see that they understand things better when they
have placed established facts, theories, and practices _in tension with
alternatives_. Critical thinking at this level should not depend on students
rejecting conventional accounts, but they do have to move through uncertainty.
Their knowledge is, at least for a time, destabilized; what has been
established cannot be taken for granted. Students can no longer expect that if
they just wait long enough the teacher will provide complete and tidy
conclusions; instead they have to take a great deal of responsibility for
their own learning. Anxieties inevitably arise for students when they have to
respond to new situations knowing that the teacher will not act as the final
arbiter of their success. A high level of critical thinking is possible when
students explore such anxieties and gain the confidence to face uncertainty
and ambiguity. (See [Taylor, "We know more"](journey.html))  
  
With respect to the iteractions among environment. science, and society, three
key tensions should emerge as the course unfolds:  
science "proper," that is, viewing scientific practice in terms of researchers
conducting a dialogue, involving concepts and evidence, with the situations
studied vs. knowledge-making as a social process, in which researchers
endeavor through interactions with other social agents to establish what
counts as knowledge;  
science as knowledge-making vs. science as a way to influence or change other
people and society; and  
simple formulations of well-bounded or strong systems vs. accounts of dynamics
among particular, unequal agents whose actions implicate or span a range of
social realms.

### SCHEDULE OF CLASSES

**Detailed instructions for preparing for classes will be distributed through
handouts and emails**  
  
**_Narrative:_** _Two features of the first class run through the entire
course, namely, getting to know and learn from fellow students and working
through activities to introduce issues in critical thinking. A brief overview
and notes in the syllabus help orient you, but the most important work in a
critical thinking course is to reflect and digest afterwards and incorporate
the issues, themes, and teaching/learning tools into your own thinking and
practice. (In this spirit, the first mini-essay is due week 2.)_  
_The first class introduces five key concepts and terms, with the expectation
that you will not appreciate their significance immediately, but will chew
over them as the course develops:_  
_**Critical thinking** (see overview above)_  
_**Heuristics** (or interpretive themes) (Propositions that stimulate, orient,
or guide our inquiries, yet break down when applied too widely)_  
_**Critical heuristics** (Heuristics that place established facts, theories,
and practices in tension with alternatives)_  
_**Intersecting processes** (Social and environmental change analyzed as
something produced by intersecting economic, social and ecological processes
operating at different scales)_  
_**Tool box for critical and creative thinking** (The more critical heuristics
a person has available to work with, the more likely they are to have a
creative, self-generated response to a new, unfamiliar case.)_  
  
**Class 1 (1/28) Introductions and Frame-setting**  
Introduction to:  
\--fellow students and their concerns  
\--key term and concepts: "Critical thinking," "Heuristics," "Intersecting
Processes," "Critical heuristics" as a potential resolution of the tension
between the last two concepts, and "Tool box for critical  & creative
thinking."  
  
Activities:  
"How do we know there is a population-environment problem?" --includes class
simulation on the "Population problem," mini-lecture on a case study of soil
erosion in Oaxaca, Mexico, analysis of language in short reading, Meffe,
"Human population control," and drawing of an intersecting processes diagram
for Pearce, "Inventing Africa." (See [related handout](island.doc))  
  
Homework tasks include: complete Pearce diagram, review the syllabus and
overview, get set-up to use the internet and computers, begin your PD
workbook, sign up for first conference, etc. (see [handout](640-02H1.doc)).  
  
**_Narrative:_** _The first class touches on the complexity of intersections
among social and environmental processes and of intersections among making
knowledge and influencing society. But the course steps back from that
complexity and instead introduces a series of heuristics, that is, simpler
themes that stimulate our thinking, open up questions, and orient our
inquiries. The first heuristic that might go into your toolbox is that
people's ideas about nature can be interpreted as (historically and socially
located) ideas about society, that is, about the social order they favor._

### KEY TEACHING/LEARNING TOOLS

**including guidelines for assignments**  
Examples of previous students' work will be distributed from time to time if
further guidance is needed. Refer to the Rubrics section for a check-list of
expectations for the assignments and other requirements.  
  
**Written assignments and presentations**  
**Note:** If you get behind, ask for an extension or skip the assignment/item
--the intended learning rarely happens if you submit a stack of late work.  
**A. Stages of development for course project** [cM, uA, uT]  
The course project should not be seen as a "term paper," but as a _process of
development_ that involves dialogue with the instructor and other students,
ongoing processing of course themes and activities, and revision (re-seeing)
in light of that dialogue and processing. To facilitate this, a sequence of
five assignments and peer commentary is required. The goals of each stage are
described below.  
_Revised Initial description_  
Building on your emailed initial draft and comments back from me, compose an
initial _overview_ of your project. This overview may, several revisions
later, end up setting the scene in the introduction of your project. In one-
two prose paragraphs (not disconnected points aka "bullets"), an overview
should convey subject, audience, and your reason for working on this project.
The subject must relate to critical thinking about the environment, science,
and society and draw on the some of the course themes and activities. Previous
semesters' projects are available for viewing on request.  
_Notes on research and planning_ [uT]  
Pull together notes on your reading and your thinking and present it in a form
organized so it can elicit useful comments from a reader (in this case, me).
To show your planning, you should submit an updated overview and an outline.
To show that you are finding out what others have been doing in your area of
interest, you should include annotated bibliography of readings done or
planned. Record the full citations for your sources, including those from the
WWW. I recommend using a bibliographic database--Endnote can be downloaded for
a 30 day trial from http://www.endnote.com  
_Work-in-progress presentation_ [pCo]  
Preparing presentations, hearing yourself deliver them, and getting feedback
usually leads to self-clarification of the overall direction of your project
and of your priorities for further work. In this spirit, 15 minute
presentations of your work-in-progress are scheduled early in your projects
and are necessarily on work-in-progress. Convey the important features of work
you have already done and, to elicit useful feedback during 3-5 minutes of Q
&A, indicate also where additional investigation or advice are needed and
where you think that might lead you.  
_Complete draft report_  
See guidelines for final report. The draft must get to the end to count, even
if some sections along the way are only sketches.  
_Final report_ (1500-2500 words, plus bibliography of references cited)  
Whether you do a research paper or prepare a set of lesson plans, the report
should Grab readers' attention, Orient them, and move through Steps so that
they appreciate the Position you have led them to and how it matches the
subject of your project. You should also include material that conveys your
process of development during the semester and in the future. The report
should not be directed to the instructor, but conceived as something helpful
to your student colleagues.  
**For the report to be counted as final, you must have revised in response to
comments from instructor and peers on complete draft.** Allow time for the
additional investigation and thinking that may be entailed.  
  
**B. Mini-essays** [pR]  
The goal of mini-essays (200-400 words) is for you to weave the course
material--readings, activities, homework tasks--into your own thinking, and
for this to help you bring your own thinking back into class activities.
Provide sources or support for any views you present. Although I will suggest
some possible topics for the mini-essays, the choice of topic is open as long
as it meets this goal. Mini-essays topics can include lesson plans. Write as
if the audience were other students or colleagues, not only the instructor.  
  
**A & B, Dialogue around written work **[cM, uA, pR]  
I try to create a dialogue with each student around written work, that is,
around your writing, my responses, and your responses in turn. Central to this
teaching/learning interaction are requests to "Revise and Resubmit." The idea
is not that you make changes to please me the teacher or to meet some unstated
standard, but that as a writer you use the eye of others to develop your own
thinking and make it work better on readers. I may continue to request
revision when I judge that the interaction can still yield significant
learning--such a request does not mean your (re)submission was "bad." Even
when a first submissions of a written assignment is excellent, angles for
learning through dialogue are always opened up.  
  
In my comments I try to capture where the writer was taking me and make
suggestions for how to clarify and extend the impact on readers of what was
written. After letting my comments sink in, you may conclude that I have
missed the point. In this case, my misreading should stimulate you to revise
so as to help readers avoid mistaking the intended point. If you do not
understand the directions I saw in your work or those I suggest for the
revision, a face-to-face or phone conversation is the obvious next step--
written comments have definite limitations when writers and readers want to
appreciate and learn from what each other is saying and thinking. **Please
talk to me immediately if you do not see how you are benefitting from the
"Revise and resubmit" process.** I am still learning how to engage students in
this in ways that take into account your various backgrounds and dispositions
and my own.  
  
Students should submit two copies of all typed assignments because I keep one
plus a carbon copy of my comments to refer back to.  
  
**C. Prepared participation and punctual attendance at class meetings** is
expected, but allowance is made for other priorities in your life. I do not
require you to give excuses for absence, lateness, or lack of preparation--
Simply make up the 80% of participation items in other ways (D-H).  
  
**D. Personal/Professional Development Workbook** [cL, cD, pCo, pR]  
In your workbook keep records or products of homework and preparatory tasks,
preparation for assignments, weekly journal-type reflections on the course and
classes, notes on readings, clippings, e-clippings. Explore, when appropriate,
the relationship between, on one hand, your interests and possible projects
and, on the other hand, the readings and activities. I encourage those of you
who find it hard to make space for journalling/reflection to stay 10 minutes
after class and write while your thoughts are fresh. If you are using the
workbook effectively, it should convey your developing process of preparing to
practice the tools and of critical thinking about course readings, activities,
and discussions. When you first submit the PD workbook for perusal, I will let
you know if you need to show more processing.  
PD workbooks will be collected for perusal twice during the semester. Bind
together pages with post-its or otherwise indicate which bits you do not want
me to look at.  
  
**Clippings and E-clippings** [cL]  
To keep up with current developments--and get you into the habit of this for
your lifelong learning-- look for articles related to disputes over science or
perceptions related to environmental issues in newspapers, magazines,
journals, and websites. Write the full citation on each article, unless it is
already included. Use large post-its to add your own reflections on specific
points in the articles you choose. Aim for one/week. Include these in your PD
workbook, including copies of items from the WWW posted to cct640Clips. For
clippings you find on the web submit the URL and brief annotation to
cct640clips@yahoogroups.com. These can be viewed at
http://www.yahoogroups.com/group/ cct640Clips. Use the search box to find
clippings on specific topics.  
  
**E. Conferences** [pC]  
for discussion of comments on assignments (see Dialogue around written work,
above), ideas for course projects, and the course as a whole. They are
important to ensure timely resolution of misunderstandings and to get a
recharge if you get behind.  
  
**F. Peer commentary** [pCo]  
After the draft report is completed, you should comment on another student's
draft. Send me a copy by email and/or include in PD workbook. Keep Elbow,
_Writing with Power_ , chapters 3 & 13 in mind when you decide what approaches
to commenting you ask for as a writer and use as a commentator. In the past I
made lots of specific suggestions for clarification and change in the margins,
but in my experience, such suggestions led only a minority of students beyond
touching up into re-thinking and revising their ideas and writing. On the
other hand, I believe that all writers value comments that reassure them that
they have been listened to and their voice, however uncertain, has been heard.  
  
**G.[Assignment Check-list](640checklist.doc) ** [uA]  
Please keep track of your assignments and revisions submitted and when they
are returned marked OK/RNR. To gauge whether you are on track for at least a
B+, simply note whether you have submitted 80% of the assignments by the dates
marked and attended 80% of the classes.  
**H. Process review** [cL, pR]  
Identify 4-6 examples that capture the process of development of your work and
thinking about facilitation and evaluation of educational change. Journaling,
freewriting, drafts, etc. may be included, that is, not simply your best
products. Explain your choices in a 250-500 word cover note and through
annotations (large post-its are a good way to do this). Submit with your PD
workbook, or extract into a portfolio.  
  
**_Other Teaching/Learning Tools_**  
**Rationale for the Assessment system** [uA]  
The rationale for grading the different assignments simply OK or R&R (revise &
resubmit) and granting an automatic B+ for 80% satisfactory completion is to
keep the focus of our teaching/learning interactions on your developing
through the semester. It allows more space for students and instructor to
appreciate and learn from what each other is saying and thinking. My goal is
to work with everyone to achieve the 80% satisfactory completion level.
Students who progress steadily towards that goal during the semester usually
end up producing work that meets the criteria for a higher grade than a B+
(see **rubrics** ). Use the **Assignment Check-list** to keep track of your
own progress. Ask for clarification if needed to get clear and comfortable
with this system.  
  
**Learning Community and email group/list** [cM, pC, pCo]  
Individually and as a group, you already know a lot about many more things
than can be covered in the syllabus. You can learn a lot from each other and
from teaching others what you know. In small groups you often review material,
share views, help each other, and undertake other activities with my guidance,
but not under my direct supervision. The email group or list (emails sent to
cct640@umbmap.cc.umb.edu) can be used to help the community develop.  
  
**Simulations, other class activities, and tools for group process**  
Each week introduces different kinds of group activities, which are as much
part of the course as the concepts. Handouts on the activities are distributed
from time to time and linked to the course website when they are ready.  
  
**Guided freewriting** [pR]  
In a freewriting exercise, you should not take your pen off the paper. Keep
writing even if you find yourself stating over and over again, "I don't know
what to say." What you write won't be seen by anyone else, so don't go back to
tidy up sentences, grammar, spelling. You will probably diverge from the
topic, at least for a time while you acknowledge other preoccupations. That's
OK--it's one of the purposes of the exercise to get things off one's chest.
However, if you keep writing for ten minutes, you should expose some thoughts
about the topic that had been below the surface of your attention--that's
another of the aims of the exercise. Reference: Elbow, chapter 2.  
  
**Taking stock at end of semester** involves multiple angles on course
evaluation (including written evaluations and Process reviews): [uA]  
a) to feed into your future learning (and other work), you take stock of your
process(es) over the semester;  
b) to feed into my future teaching (and future learning about how students
learn), I take stock of how you, the students, have learned.

### RUBRICS

_Overall course grade_. This rubric is simple, but unusual. Read the Rationale
in the Key Teaching/Learning Tools amd ask questions to make sure you have it
clear.  
  
B+ is earned automatically for 80% of Written items (=8 of 10, including Final
Report) marked OK/RNR (=OK/ Revision-reflection-resubmission Not Requested)
and 80% of Participation items fulfilled (=16 of 20).  
The qualities below will determine whether a higher grade is earned. For each
quality fulfilled very well you get 2 %points or 1 %point if you did an OK
job, but there was room for more development/attention. A total of 8-14
%points, gets you an A-; 15+% points, an A.  
A sequence of assignments paced more or less as in syllabus,  
often revised thoroughly and with new thinking in response to comments. [pR]  
Project innovative,  
well planned and carried out with considerable initiative, and  
indicates that you can guide others to think critically about the interactions
between environmental, social, and scientific change. [uC,uP]  
Project report clear and well structured,  
with supporting references and detail, and  
professionally presented. [cM]  
Active, prepared participation in all classes. [pCo]  
Consistent work outside class as evidenced in PD workbook [cL,pR]  
Process Review that shows deep reflection on your development through the
semester and  
maps out the future directions in which you plan to develop [cL,pR]  
  
If you do not reach the B+ level, the grade for Written assignments  &
presentations will be pro-rated from B+ down to C for 50% of assignments
OK/RNR. Similarly the Participation & process grade goes down to C for 50% of
participation items.  
  
_Converting points to percentages to grades_. Count each writing OK/RNR as 10
points up to a maximum of 80 and each participation item as 5 points up to a
maximum of 80. Combine these points into a % grade = Writing points x2/3 \+
Participation points x 1/3. If your combined total is 80%, the rubric above is
used to assign grades of B+, A-, and A. Below 80%, the minimum grade for B is
72.5%; for B- is 65%; for C+ is 57.5%; and for C is 50%.  
  
_Written assignments_ (10 assignment points each up to maximum of 80)  
Each assignment will gain 10 points if marked **OK/RNR** (= Revision-
reflection-resubmission Not Requested) meaning you have met almost all of the
guidelines described in the section on Key teaching/Learning Tools (and
summarized below), but **R** evision **and R** esubmission will be requested
if you have not (0 points). Rationale for the assignments is conveyed in the
Key Teaching/Learning tools section. Comments made as part of Dialogue around
written work (see earlier in syllabus) provide guidance tailored to each
student's specific interests and needs.  
  
In addition to the specific rubric for each assignment, the following _General
Expectations_ apply:  
Two copies of all papers must be turned in during class typed on standard 8.5"
x 11" paper, using at least 1" margins, a standard 10- or 12-point font such
as Times or Helvetica, and (preferably) one and half line spacing. Do not
submit work by email unless specifically arranged with the instructor.  
The student's name, course number, assignment number, and date of writing or
revising must appear on the first page at the top right. Subsequent pages must
contain the student's name and the page number. Do not use a cover page.  
Proofread your work for spelling, grammar, punctuation, and coherence of
paragraphs. (Each paragraph should have one clear topic that is supported
and/or developed by what is in it.) If writing  
is difficult for you, arrange assistance from a fellow student, the Graduate
writing center (S-1-03, 287-5708) or a professional editor -- do not expect
the instructor to be your writing teacher.

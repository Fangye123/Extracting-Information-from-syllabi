Course Description and Objectives  
The Renaissance is a discussion-oriented seminar focusing on the culture of
Italy from roughly 1350 to 1550. The course is designed to introduce students
of the liberal arts to the sources and historiography of the Italian
Renaissance. While consideration is given to the economic, social, and
political history of the period, considerable emphasis is placed on
Renaissance humanism and art and on the relationship between culture and
society. There are no prerequisites to the course, but students are expected
to be able to analyze and interpret primary documents thoughtfully, evaluate
alternative interpretations of historiographical problems critically, and
write substantive, interpretive research papers.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  
  

Exams will consist of two essay questions. Each of the three exams will cover
roughly one-third of the course; the third exam will also include a
comprehensive section.

2\. A research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 25%
for the second)  
  

The research paper can be on any topic in Italian Renaissance history. Papers
are to be analytical and interpretive; they should present a thesis and
develop an argument. You are encouraged to use primary sources, and you are
expected to examine the historiographical context of your topic. First drafts
may be limited to sources available in the Duggan Library, but you are
expected to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional sources for the final
draft. You should include with your first draft a bibliography based on a
universal search for sources.

The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of the thesis and
argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the quality of the
writing. You should consult with me about your paper at least a week before
each draft is due.

The [Electronic Database](http://history.hanover.edu/data.html) page  on the
History Web Site may prove helpful in bibliographical searches. The
_Encyclopedia of the Renaissance_ (Duggan reference CB361 .E52 1999) is a good
recent reference work. Links to internet sources can be found on the [Italian
Renaissance](http://history.hanover.edu/early/italren.htm) page  of the
History Department's Internet Archive of Texts and Documents.

3\. Class participation (10%)  
  

The success of this class, as a small seminar, depends upon the quality of the
dialogue in class. It is expected that you will attend every class and that
you will be fully prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day.
Class participation grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency
of your contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

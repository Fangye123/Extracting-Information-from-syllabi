General Information

Catalog Description: The course is designed to provide insights into the
nature of cities and smaller urban places.

Intended Clientele: There are no prerequisites for this course, and those who
enroll need not have taken any previous work in geography at the college
level. It is anticipated that a majority of those who take the class will be
sophomores or juniors. G&ES; 310 is required in the Department of Geography
and Environmental Studies' B.S. program in [ Environmental
Planning](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/ges/programs.htm#BS_Geography). The
class should also prove to be particularly valuable to students in Secondary
Education--Social Studies, Public Administration, Parks & Recreation, Social
Work, Environmental Studies, and those interested in real estate or health
care planning.

Credit:  The class carries three semester hours of credit. It is does not
fulfill any of the university's liberal studies requirements.

Instructor: _James C. Hughes_ , Professor, Department of Geography and
Environmental Studies. His office is located in room 101-A of the Spotts World
Culture Building. Office hours are Mondays and Wednesdays 2:30 - 4:00;
Tuesdays and Thursdays 9:00 - 10:00. Appointments may be made at other times
of mutual convenience. The telephone number is 724-738-2383, and a message may
be left at any time 24 hours a day. E-mail may be sent to the following
address: james.hughes@sru.edu. Fax: 724-738-2188.

Class Meetings: Urban Geography is scheduled to meet during Period B (10:00 -
11:20 a.m.) on Tuesdays and Thursdays in room 114 of the Spotts World Culture
Building. There will also be a class meeting at 8:30 a.m. on Tuesday, December
15, 1998 (during finals week) at which time projects will be returned and
grades assigned.

Attendance: Please select a permanent seat. An attendance record will be kept,
and attendance reports sent to the Administration as requested. _Regular,
faithful class attendance is most highly recommended!_

Examinations and Grades:  Grades will be determined in the following manner.

25% - First Exam - Thursday, September 24, 1998, 10:00 a.m.  
25% - Second Exam - Tuesday, October 27, 1998, 10:00 a.m.  
25% - Third Exam - Tuesday, December 1, 1998, 10 a.m.  
25% - Project on Selected Neighborhood--see below

Required Textbook: John J. Macionis and Vincent N. Parrillo, _Cities and Urban
Life_ , Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1998. 432pp. Additional reading
materials will be distributed in class and will also be required reading.

Project on Selected Neighborhood: You are asked to select a [ census tract
block group](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/ges/discover/d-6-47.htm) within
the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area to use as a study area for your semester
project. It should be a block group that has not been previously studied for
this class, and should be closer to or within the City of Pittsburgh or
another solidly built-up area (such as Butler) within the metropolitan area
than many of those that were studied in the past. Instructions on how to study
your tract and what to look for will be given throughout the semester.

The final project on the neighborhood that you select will come in two parts:
1) an oral report, approximately fifteen minutes in length, based upon your
research on the area, census data, and interviews with at least three
residents and/or businesspeople working there; and 2) a written description of
250 words and two snapshot-sized photographs that represent the character of
that neighborhood. The written text should be sent via e-mail to me at
james.hughes@sru.edu. The snapshots should be given to me in person. The
written description and photographs will be added to those that are [already
displayed](http://www.sru.edu/depts/artsci/ges/urban.htm) on the World Wide
Web and will be accessible to the public. The oral presentation will be
according to the following tentative schedule:

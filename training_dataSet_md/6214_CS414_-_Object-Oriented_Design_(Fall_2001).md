## Basic Course Information

**Description:** _The course will focus on object-oriented (OO) requirements
and design principles, techniques, and modeling notations. Students will
become familiar with OO modeling techniques (using the Unified Modeling
Language (UML)), agile ("lightweight") processes, and techniques for
transforming design models to code. While there is a significant emphasis on
modeling, students will be required to transform models to code
implementations in a software development project. Students will also be
introduced to concepts related to component-based software development, design
patterns, and software architectures._

**Prerequisite** : This is a STRICT prerequisite:  

  * Successful completion of CS314.

## Course Syllabus

The following is a _plan_ ; information provided here is subject to change!

The following is a tentative course schedule:

  * **Week 1** : Introduction to Agile Processes, Use Cases, Domain Models 
  * **Week 2** : Requirements Modeling: Use Cases, Domain Models, System Sequence Diagrams 
  * **Week 3** : Modeling System Behavior: Interaction Diagrams, Realizing Use Cases   
Quiz 1

  * **Week 4** : Special Topic/Discussion Session 1: Component-Based Development in Java (Guest Speaker - S. Ghosh)   
Test 1

  * **Week 5** : Project inception lockdown, presentations 
  * **Week 6** : Advanced domain modeling concepts, Design Class Diagrams, Mapping designs to code   
Quiz 2

  * **Week 7** : Design Patterns   
Test 2

  * **Week 8** : SSDs, Modeling behavior with Statecharts   
Quiz 3

  * **Week 9** : Project iteration 1 lockdown 
  * **Week 10** :Design: Architectural Modeling and Patterns   
Quiz 4

  * **Week 11** :Special Topic/Discussion Session 2: Agile Modeling and Agile Processes   
Model and Code Refactoring

  * **Week 12** :Project iteration 2 lockdown 
  * **Week 13** :Model and Code Refactoring cont'd   
Handling Persistence  
Quiz 5

  * **Week 14** :Thanksgiving Break 
  * **Week 15** :Project presentations 
  * **Week 16** :Course wrap-up   
Review  
Quiz 6

The Discussion Sessions involve students presenting their views on current
software development trends. Students, working in groups of 3 or more, will be
asked to research a topic and present their findings. Topics targeted for this
semester are: Agile Processes/Modeling and Component Technologies. Guest
lectures will be arranged for some of these sessions.

The Quizzes will be given in the class or will be available online (see webCT)
and should not take longer than 10 minutes to complete. Students will get
marks simply for completing the quizzes. Answers will be discussed in the
class. The quizzes are intended to gauge student understanding of the concepts
and to help students prepare for the tests.

### Modeling Assignments

There will be a total of three modeling assignments. Students will work in
pairs or groups of 3 on these assignments. Assignments must be handed in at
the start of class on due dates. All assignments must be typed. Handwritten
assignments will not be accepted.

Modeling Assignment Schedule

  * September 6: Modeling Assignment 1 due 
  * September 18: Modeling Assignment 2 due 
  * October 11: Modeling Assignment 3 due 

### Programming Project

A course project will be made available during the second week of the
semester. Students will initially form groups of 2 to 4 individuals and will
develop the project deliverables using an iterative/incremental process. A
total of three iterations are mandated (groups can subdivide each of these
iterations into subiterations if they deem necessary). Working code with
documented designs must be delivered at the end of each iteration. The process
for each iteration is mostly defined by the group, but groups will be mandated
to use particular development techniques (e.g., pair-programming and testcase-
driven code development) or develop specific models. These restrictions will
be posted on webCT before the start of each iteration.

Time will be scheduled during the semester for "lockdown" sessions. The first
lockdown session will focus on completing a first attempt at modeling the
requirements and scoping the first iteration. In the class following this
lockdown students must present their use cases and domain models and the
planned scope of their first iteration. In subsequent lockdowns, groups will
focus on getting artifacts in place to produce working implementations for an
iteration. In the classes following these lockdowns, groups must hand in
working code, and they must present their designs to the rest of the class
(this marks the end of an iteration). In the presentation classes groups can
negotiate with other groups to create mergers. Marks will be awarded (in
"real-time") based on quality of presentations and the level of involvement of
each group member in producing the results (groups must state each
individual's responsibility in producing the results in their presentations).
Individual members of groups can be "fired" (recall that marks will be awarded
based on level of involvement; if the lecturer judges that a student has not
contributed significantly in the current iteration, the group mark will be
adversely affected). The "fired" members can choose to complete the project on
their own (a daunting task) or negotiate to join another group. All mergers
must be approved by the lecturer. Students can also appeal their "firing" from
a group by presenting their cases to the lecturer.

The planned schedule of iterations is given below:

  * Week 5: Inception lockdown and requirements presentations 
  * Week 9: Closing iteration 1: lockdown and presentations 
  * Week 12:Closing iteration 2: lockdown and presentations 
  * Week 15:Closing iteration 3 (final product): lockdown and presentations 
Once confirmed the schedule will be strict! Groups can choose to deliver less
features but they **must** deliver what they have implemented after the
presentations.

The small print: _Requirements can change anytime during the process! Also do
not assume that you will be working on the product you delivered in the
previous iteration in the next iteration. The lecturer has the right to
arbitrarily assign groups to work on a product produced by another group.
Ofcourse, in such an event you can consult the other group for an explanation
of their design but don't bank on getting much of their time - they would be
busy working on their next release as well!_ Good Luck!

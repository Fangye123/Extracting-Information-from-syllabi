Structure and function of modern computing systems. Topics studied include
combinational and sequential logic, number systems and computer arithmetic,
hardware design and organization of CPU, I/O systems and memory systems,
instruction set and assembly language design, and current trends and
developments in computer architecture and organization.

**Course Plan** ( _tentative_ )

> This course will have two distinct parts.  Part 1 of the course will focus
on learning about computer architectures at an organizational level, the role
of performance and the MIPS assembly language.  In the second part of this
course we will learn the skills needed to design a data path for the MIPS
language.  By the end of the course a successful student would have built a
simulator model of the data path and programmed it with an elementary machine
language program.

**Class Policies**

> **Prior Knowledge**  
>  Be comfortable in an Unix environment.  
> Programming.

>

> **Class Account**  
>  cs4720.  Assignment files will be found in this account and online.

>

> **Testing and Grading**  
>  All exams are comprehensive, but emphasize the most recent material.  
> Midterm ---------------------------------- 33%  
> Projects/Homework/Designs/Quizzes1,2 \--  33%  
> Final -------------------------------------- 34%

>

> Grades will be assigned based on the usual 90-80-70-60 grading scheme.  
> 1Grades will be weighted to reflect complexity.  
> 2There may be unannounced pop-quizes

>

> **Due Dates:** Late assignments will be accepted up to 3 days late with a
penalty of 10% a day.   For the most part you will use the `submit` system to
submit solutions from your Unix account to the class account.  Grades will be
emailed back to your Unix account.  You have 1 week from the day you receive
your emailed grade to contest it.  We will not entertain grade changes to
assignments beyond this time.

>

> **Make-up policy:   **Do not miss exams - there is no make-up policy.
However, if for some unavoidable and valid (in the judgment of the instructor)
reason you have to miss an exam speak with me _before_ the exam.   I may add a
single test percentage on to the final percentage.

>

> **Notices:**   I maintain a notice board for this class and place
announcements on it periodically.  Announcements made on the notice board are
just as binding as those made in class and it is your responsibility to read
and keep up with the announcements.

>

> **Academic integrity:** Please read the Departmental policy on academic
integrity.   Unless otherwise stated, all assignments are to be strictly your
own work. Of course, you can talk over general principles and concepts about
an assignment with others, but sharing of printed or electronic media is not
acceptable. Guard you own work. Do not write solutions for others, and don't
have others write solutions for you. Just as the work on an essay in English
has to be your own, assignments in CSCI 4720 have to be your own work unless
specifically stated otherwise.  If suspected of academic dishonesty, I will
report the incident to the appropriate authorities.

>

> **Work load:**   This class involves allot of work.  You will have a large
amount of reading, multiple assignments using new software packages and
systems.  The compressed summer format only adds to the work load and
pressure.

**Course Title/Number:** |  Physical Science for Elementary Education Majors /
1044  
**Instructor:** |  Mr. Steven J. Maier, Room SC107, Phone 327-8562, email
[sjmaier@nwosu.edu](mailto:sjmaier@nwosu.edu)  
**Office Hours:** |  Monday - Wednesday: 1 - 4 p.m.  
My schedule is posted on my office door.  See me during the hours above, free
spaces on my schedule, or by arrangement.  
**Textbook:** | [Physics by
Inquiry](http://www.phys.washington.edu/groups/peg/pbi.html), Vols. I and II
by Lillian C. McDermott.  ISBN: 0471548707.  A bound laboratory notebook is
also required.  
**Course Overview:** |  This is an introductory inquiry based course in
physics designed for pre-service elementary teachers and elementary education
majors.  It is intended for non-science or non-technical majors.  The entire
course is laboratory based, without formal lecture.  Topics to be covered
include properties of matter, astronomy by sight, and electric circuits.  
**Course Objectives:** |  A hands-on oriented course designed to allow
students to construct their own working models of observed phenomena.
Students will then test their models and refine or change them as experiments
and their own conclusions warrant.  
**Course Requirements:  ** | The course will consist of three two hour labs
each week.  Homework will be assigned regularly and will count toward the
final grade.  A major paper related to in-class work will also be assigned and
discussed at the appropriate time (after the midterm).  
**Evaluation/Grading:** |  The grade in the course will depend upon your
participation and involvement in class-time activities, homework assignments,
an assigned paper, and two examinations. The homework will be graded on a
letter scale (A, B, C, D, or Re-Submit).  Grades lower than a C may be
corrected and resubmitted within a week for re-grading to earn a maximum grade
of C+. The examinations will be open book: you may use the Physics by Inquiry
text(s), your bound laboratory notebook in which you will have recorded data
and comments from in-class work, and your graded assignments. The better
completed your student notebook and homework, the more helpful they will be
for examinations.  
**Attendance Policy:** |  Attendance in class is expected.  Attendance is
recorded and counts toward the final grade.  Role is taken at the beginning of
class.  *In accordance with campus policy, to be eligible to receive a passing
grade in this class the student must be in attendance 75% of the class/lab
time.  
**Disability:** |  Any student needing academic accommodations for a physical,
mental, or learning disability should contact the Disabled Student Services
Coordinator (Room FA 117) or faculty member personally, within the first two
weeks of the semester so that appropriate accommodations can be arranged.  
**Academic Honesty:** |  It is expected the work turned in by a student will
be authentic and original.  If turned in work is not consistent with academic
honesty, it will receive no grade.  Second time offense will result in either
overall grade reduction or an automatic failing grade for the course.  
**Miscellaneous:** |  Just next to my office there is a Conference Room which
is available to anyone who needs a place to study alone or in a small group.  
**Exams:** |  Exams are open book and open notes.  The midterm and final
examination both count the same toward the final grade.  The final exam is NOT
cumulative.  
**Journal:** |  You are expected to keep a bound laboratory notebook in which
to record experimental data, answers to questions, and notes concerning in-
class work. The style and content may change with  
time as you decide what is important to put into writing. The laboratory
notebook serves as a supplementary textbook. The examinations will be open
book, including the formal textbooks,  
supplementary textbook (the laboratory notebook), and homework solutions. It
is to your advantage to continue to develop the content and organization of
your laboratory notebook. [students have found the supplementary textbook
helpful even after the course if they are in-service teachers.]  
**Make-up work:** |  To help the progress of the class, you may need to
schedule a time with your lab partners a time to come in and do make-up work
during my office hours.  Other times may be also be arranged . . .  
**Grading:** |  A     (100-90%)     Midterm       20%  
B     (89-80%)       Final             20%  
C     (79-70%)       Assignments 20%  
D     (69-60%)       Participation 20%  
                              Paper           20%

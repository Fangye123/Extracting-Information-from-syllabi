    Buddhism has been one of the major connective links among the varied cultures of South, Southeast, and East Asia for over two millennia, and in this century it has established a solid presence in Europe and North America. This course will survey the history, doctrines, and practices of Buddhism in South Asia, Tibet, and East Asia. Readings will be in both primary texts and secondary sources, and will be supplemented by films and slides. The format will be a combination of lecture and discussion.

**Course Requirements and Grading:**

**1.** _Participation_ (15%). Regular attendance, timely completion of reading
assignments, active participation in class discussions, and one short
conference with me in my office no later than Friday, January 29. Grading

>  B regular attendance, occasional participation  
>  C too many absences OR too little participation  
>  D too many absences AND too little participation  
>  F more serious problems

>

> _Option_ : To supplement the _class discussion_ portion of your
participation grade, you may turn in, at any time but a maximum of one per
week, written reactions to, reflections on, or questions about the assigned
reading. These will be graded 1 (credit), 2 (good), or 3 (excellent) and will
be returned within a week.

**2.** _Midterm exam_ (15%), consisting of short, objective questions.

**3.** _Two take-home essays_ (30%), 3-5 pages each. Topics will be
distributed in class one week before they are due.

**4.** _Panel discussion_ (15%). Discussion of the articles in ****_Buddhism
and Ecology_ will be led by panels of three students. Each panel will meet
with me a few days before their presentation.

**5.** _Final exam_ (25%), consisting of short identifications (like the
midterm) and one or two 3-4 page essays.

> _Option_ : If you have received B+ or better on both take-home essays and
the midterm exam, and if you have a topic that you would like to pursue
further, you may write a 6-10 page research paper (typed, double-spaced, plus
bibliography) instead of taking the final exam. You must clear your topic with
me before Friday, April 9 and turn in a preliminary bibliography by Friday,
April 16. The paper will make use of at least two books or articles outside of
assigned class readings, and will be due the day of the final exam.

Nations and Nationalism in Eastern Europe: 1848-1998**

The historical construction of nationalist identities, social movements, and
self-proclaimed nation states in East-Central Europe out of multi-ethnic
communities and multi-cultural Empires, from the revolutions of 1848 to the
contemporary break up of Yugoslavia.

Course Requirements:

The course will be conducted primarily as a discussion class. Although I will
lecture on background material, particularly in the first half of the
semester, it is imperative that you come to class fully prepared. This means
reading AND reflecting on the day's assignment well in advance of class
discussion! Occasionally I will distribute study guides and maps to help you
focus your thoughts about the readings. In addition, you should be aware that
the history department has implemented the following draconian policy on
attendance: "Students are required to attend all classes for the successful
completion of the course. Unexcused absences will result in a lower grade."
Please let me know in advance of any unavoidable absences (or illnesses).
Written Requirements for the class include:

1) A take-home Midterm Exam due no later than Friday, Oct. 12 at noon in the
department  
office.  
2) Participation in a discussion of the Andric novel.  
2) One 7-page analytic paper on the period 1914-1939, due no later than
Wednesday, Nov. 21 at noon .  
3) One 12-page research or analytic paper on a subject of your choice, due
Tuesday, Dec. 18  
4) A take-home Final Exam essay based on the Kundera novel, due Thursday
December 20

I will provide possible paper topics for the both papers, however, you are
also encouraged to develop your own topic based on your particular interests
and in consultation with me. You must have communicated your carefully
constructed topic for the second paper to me no later than November 30. PLEASE
PLAN CAREFULLY. Since the bulk of the written work for the class is due in the
second half of the semester you must think ahead, and occasionally you may
want to complete an assignment before the actual deadline.

  
Maps

I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourselves quickly with the
historical geography of the regions we'll study. There are several excellent
atlases in McCabe, and the Centenia program is pretty helpful in this regard.
You may also wish to order Richard & Ben Crampton's Atlas of Eastern Europe in
the 20th Century (Routledge) but it is expensive.

**Goals  
** The main goal of this course is not to tell you who killed JFK or whether
it was a conspiracy-you will see that there is abundant evidence on both sides
of the question. Rather, this course is intended to show you how to think
about the subject rigorously. Thinking skills are unusually important in this
case because enough evidence has been generated over the years to support just
about any interpretation you want. In order to distinguish the reliable from
the unreliable or the irrelevant (most of it), you need to be able to think
critically and analytically, in ways that perhaps few of you are familiar
with. In understanding the JFK assassination, what you know (or think you
know) is much less important than how you come to know it. In fact, this
course might legitimately be entitled "Epistemology of the JFK Assassination."

This course has five parts. The first part surveys the important facts of the
case and how the two major governmental investigations (the Warren Commission
and the House Select Committee on Assassinations) established them. The second
part reviews the major critics of the official conclusions and summarizes
their conspiracy theories. The third part deals with analytical thinking. It
surveys the types of evidence and how to draw reliable conclusions from them.
Time permitting, it will also discuss the all-important scientific evidence.
The fourth part is preparing for the Providence conference (see below) and
attending it. The fifth part reviews the conference and considers the
continuing effects of the assassination in American life. By the end of the
semester, you should have an excellent idea of just where the evidence in this
case really leads.

We go to such trouble to understand the assassination because it was a seminal
event that changed attitudes all over the country and helped usher in the
sixties and the seventies. The more that we understand such an event, the
better. Also, the thinking skills you acquire will serve you for the rest of
your life.

**Materials  
**             ¡¤ _The Warren Commission Report_ , Longmeadow Press, Stamford,
1992  
            ¡¤ Jim Marrs, _Crossfire: The Plot That Killed Kennedy_ , Carroll & Graf Publishers, Inc., New York, 1989  
            ¡¤ Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar, _JFK, The Book of the Film; The Documented Screenplay_ , Applause Books, New York, 1992.

The _Warren Report_ is the granddaddy of JFK books. Its conclusion that Lee
Harvey Oswald acted alone remained unchallenged for only a few months until a
band of vocal critics began attacking it. Today it is dismissed wholesale by
conspiracy theorists, many of whom call it a work of fiction.

_Crossfire_ , by Jim Marrs, offers an excellent example of the conspiracist
approach to the assassination, including a broad overview of the main
conspiracy theories. This book was also one of the main sources for Oliver
Stone's important film _JFK_. But did Marrs bare too much of himself when he
recently published _Alien Agenda_ , a book that unashamedly claims that
extraterrestrials have visited earth repeatedly?

Oliver Stone's _JFK_ was an exceedingly influential film that among other
things led directly to Congress's establishing the Assassination Records
Review Board, which in its brief lifetime declassified and released more than
one million pages of records related to the assassination. How did Stone
formulate the views portrayed in his film, and what was he trying to do there?
By presenting the original screenplay, Oliver Stone's research notes, and a
comprehensive collection of articles pro and con that appeared around the time
the film opened, Stone and Sklar's _JFK, The Book of the Film; The Documented
Screenplay_ offers us an important look into Stone's mind and provides
surprising answers to some of these questions.

In addition, we will deal with important special topics such as the physics of
JFK's movements after the killing shot, the chemical analysis of the bullet
fragments, and the acoustical analysis that led the House Select Committee on
Assassinations to declare a probable conspiracy. Handouts will be used here.

**The 1999 Providence Conference of the JFK Assassination  
** A special feature of this course will be participating in the 1999
Providence Conference on the JFK Assassination, which will be held at CCE
(Shepard Building) 16-18 April 1999. We anticipate that about 50 people will
be attending this New England conference. Each of you will participate by
attending and presenting a brief talk, individually or in pairs, on some
aspect of the assassination that you have found most interesting. This
presentation will substitute for a term paper. You will each have 5-10 minutes
to describe the topic, why it interests you, why you think it is important to
understanding the assassination, and how it has affected your view of the
assassination.

**Format, homework, exams, grading  
** We meet MWF at 11 a.m. in Washburn 309. Typically, we will first discuss
the homework or the reading for that day and then introduce the material to be
read for the next class. Discussion will often be lively, as different points
of view clash. Class participation is very important in this seminar, and
differences of opinion will be respected provided only that they can each be
defended logically. Our only rule is: you propose it, you defend it.

Assignments will be due for many of the classes, and will be graded and
returned at the next class. Most will be questions about material you will
have read. Quality of writing is important-sentences and paragraphs are to be
constructed to the highest standards of written English. I reserve the right
to help you improve your writing skills because I teach graduate writing on
the Bay Campus. Handwritten answers are acceptable as long as they are easily
legible. Late assignments will be penalized by 50%. By putting full effort
into all homework assignments, you can keep up with the work and earn a high
final grade.

Be prepared to work hard for this class because the evidence on the
assassination is full of twists, turns, and contradictions that take time to
sort out. I would be doing you no favor by offering a class that was less than
rigorous. Plan to spend up to three hours outside class for each hour in. But
I do not ask more than nine outside hours in any given week-if you reach that
level, you may quit without penalty, and I will assume responsibility for
making the assignments overly long.

There will be a regular final exam on Friday 14 May, 3-6 p.m. If you really
want a midterm exam, I can be persuaded to give one. If there is a midterm
exam, the final grade will be 30% on homework, 20% on the midterm, 20% on the
oral presentation, and 30% on the final. If there is no midterm exam, the
final grade for HPR102A will be 40% on homework, 20% on the oral presentation,
and 40% on the final.

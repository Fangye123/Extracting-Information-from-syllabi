scientific thought as it relates to Western civilization. We will consider
topics in the history of the physical and biological sciences from 18th
century Newtonian science to 20th century science and cosmology. Scientific
activities will be related to contemporary philosophical, religious, cultural,
and social contexts.

Wednesday, 10:00 to 11:00 am  
Friday, 8:00 to 9:00 am**

**My office phone message # 656-4421. My e-mail hsteffen@zoo.uvm.edu**

**COURSE GRADES**

Course grades will be awarded as follows:

1\. **THREE In-Class Essays** \- 60%

2. **Final Examination (TWO ESSAYS)** \- 40%

All students must write all in-class essays, and both final examination
essays. **Failure to write ANY essay** **will result in a failure for the
course.** The essay examinations are not optional. If this is not clear,
please ask me any questions that you may have.

Final semester letter grades will be awarded as a result of a straight
numerical average of the numerical grades assigned to each component above:
0-59=F; 60-69=D; 70-79=C; 80-89=B; 90-100=A. Plus and minus will be added to
these letters. All components of the grade must be completed in order to
receive a total passing grade for the course. [ If it was necessary for you to
miss the examination, for reasons of health or family emergency, you must
arrange to take that examination as soon as possible after you return to
class.]

After reading the description of the course requirements, it is your
responsibility to understand what is required for this course. I am willing to
answer any questions that you might have about the course requirements.
**Regular class attendance, taking careful reading and lecture notes, reading,
writing, and learning history are your responsibilities.** I will help you to
learn and understand the history of science this semester.



**3\. STUDENT WRITING REQUIREMENTS**

**THREE IN-CLASS ESSAYS** \-  [These essays will be written on 7 Feb., 10
Mar., and 14 Apr., as noted above.]

There will be 3 essay examinations given in class during the course of the
semester. These examinations will last for 50 minutes. You will receive a
numerical grade for each essay. The essays will be averaged for a total grade,
worth 60% of your final course grade. **[ NOTE - If it was necessary for you
to miss the examination, for reasons of health or family emergency, you must
arrange to take the examination as soon as possible after your return to
class.]** Topics for these essays will be chosen directly from the required
reading assignments, and from the class lectures, to that date. It is crucial
that you read the required readings carefully, and that you stay current with
the reading assignments. **You will need to take careful READING AND LECTURE
NOTES throughout the semester.** In your essay, you will be expected to: (1)
provide a full summary of the information available to you on the topic; and
(2) display an understanding of this information by making appropriate
connections between the topic and the historical context of the times. Your
essays will be evaluated on the basis of BOTH information content, and
evidence that you have understood the topic by relating it to the broader
historical narrative. You are expected to display both knowledge and
understanding in these essays.

You will be provided with study questions before each examination. You should
prepare your draft essay answer to each of the study questions at home, well
in advance of the exam. One of these questions will be selected, at random,
for you to write during class. You should prepare your essays carefully, so
that you will be able to complete them during the 50 minute examination
period. If you cannot write for the full 50 minute examination period, it is
clear that you have not found enough information, or given enough thought to
your essay.

[NOTE - For helpful suggestions on preparing your essays at home, and for
writing your essay in class, see **_Writer's Guide: History_** . ]



**FINAL EXAMINATION - May**

There will be two essay questions on topics encompassing the full semester's
work on your final examination. **You will have three hours to write your TWO
essays.** These essays should incorporate the historical knowledge and
understanding that you acquired in preparing for your short, in-class essays.
You will be expected to synthesize information, and to analyze and evaluate
historical questions related to the course in your final examination essays.

You will be provided with study questions before your final examination. These
questions are not only longer, they also require a broader conceptual
understanding of the history of science than the relatively direct and
specific essays that you have prepared for and written during the semester.
You should review your reading and lecture notes carefully in preparation for
these essays. Your previous preparations and drafts for each of the essay
examination questions during the semester will be very important to you, as
you prepare for the final examination. You should review all of your reading
and lecture notes, as well as the drafts that you prepared for each of the
study questions for the three in-class essay exams. Two of the study questions
for the final examination will be chosen, at random, for you to write for your
final examination.

The final examination date and time are chosen by the University. You must
write the final examination at this scheduled time and date.

> **Course content** : The major topic of the Fall 2000 offering of "Russian
Film" is twentieth-century Russian cultural history as it reflected in the art
of cinema. More important than historical periods, of course, are the cultural
trends, relationship between culture and officialdom, peculiarities of
national self-perception; gender based interpretations and artistic realities
in Russian films.

>

> **Expectations** : Course participants should be able to comment on film
art, orally and in writing, using background information from the course
textbook. Brief oral critiques and reports and a course paper, as well as
class discussions and in-class writing provide opportunities to show one's
ability.

films a second time in the Language Laboratory, University Hall 302.

Departmental and University Policies; Students with Disabilities:

"Make-Up" Examinations: 

If you miss an announced quiz or examination, you will be allowed to take a make-up examination only after presenting a written excuse, signed by a medical doctor, to your instructor.  No other excuse will be accepted.  Excuses must be submitted to your i































nstructor no later than 24 hours after the time of the examination. 

Academic Dishonesty:

All students are responsible for acquainting themselves with the University guidelines on Academic Discipline in the M-Book under "Student Conduct Regulations." on p.3. 
In AHA 222, each student should be particularly aware of the rules regarding plagiarism and cheating.  Plagiarism is the submission of another person's work or thought as one's own, either by direct copying or by insufficient acknowledgment of the source.































  Cheating is the use of any form of assistance while taking a quiz or examination.  The Department of Art History and Archaeology takes the infringement of these rules very seriously and carries out the appropriate academic and disciplinary actions. 
During an examination, silence is required from the moment a test paper is handed our until it has been handed in.  No books or written material of any kind should be in your sight once the examination has begun, and you should keep your eyes on your own 































paper.  If you have a question during an examination, raise your hand and an instructor will come to you. 

Students with Disabilities:

Students who have special conditions as addressed by the Americans with Disabilities Act, and who need any test or course materials to be furnished in an alternative format, should notify the Access Office and the instructor immediately.  Reasonabl































e efforts will be made to accommodate the needs of these students.

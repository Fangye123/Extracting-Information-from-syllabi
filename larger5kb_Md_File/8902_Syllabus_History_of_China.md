The course began as a study of "Modern China," and I expanded it to include an
overview of all Chinese history.  The course emphasizes Chinese history during
and since the Qing Dynasty, with a quick overview of dynastic history since
the Shang Dynasty period. Most of the course attends to late Qing and
twentieth-century developments including the Chinese Communist ascendancy,
Maoist ideology, Deng's reform leadership, and Chinese relations with Taiwan,
Hong Kong (reverted to Chinese sovereignty from Britain in 1997) and the
United States in particular among the world powers.  In Fall 2000 the course
is team taught with a scholar from the Quangdong Foreign Language Normal
School in Guangzhou, Guangdong, PRC, and in cooperation with the ETBU
Department of International Education.

**Course Objectives**  
    * To acquaint you with the broad outlines of Chinese history from antiquity to the brink of China's introduction to modernity and the West.
    * To introduce you to the traditional values of Han Chinese society as found in the various  cultural practices and assumptions of the Chinese, and 
    * To examine the distinctions between Chinese and Western, particularly American, cultures and societies.
    * To acquaint you with the geographical, topographical, and climatological features of East Asia that have influenced Chinese civilization and have, in turn, been influenced by human activities across time.
    * To engage or gain an introductory experience with certain features of Chinese culture; for example, some rudimentary learning of Chinese spoken and written language, an acquaintance with Chinese art forms such as music, dance, calligraphy, poetry, or painting, in order to enhance cultural understanding.
    * To examine Chinese history using established principles and methods of historical inquiry, and to place Chinese history in the context of world history.
    * To provide students the opportunity to understand Chinese history and culture and to develop creative ways of responding to and analyzing the values and practices that culture presents.
    * To discuss and analyze the recent and continuing role of the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, and the Overseas Chinese in global economics, politics and culture.
**Readings**  
    * Fairbank, John K., & Goldman, Merle. _China: A New History_. Enlarged edition. Cambridge, Mass: Belknap, 1998.
    * Jung Chang. _Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China_.   New York: Anchor Books, 1992.
    * Mungello, D.E.  _The Great Encounter of China and the West, 1500-1800_.   Lanham, Maryland:  Rowman & Littlefield, 1999.
    * Additional readings updating recent and contemporary developments.
**Supplemental Readings**  
    * _The South China Morning Post_ : hard copy in the Jarrett Library, or daily, free access, Internet editions at:  http://www.scmp.com/     The South China Morning Post is of course a newspaper, but as it is based in Hong Kong it typically has numerous  references on any given day not only to current affairs but to traditional features of Chinese life and society.
    * Various Internet Resources: for example, go to www.google.com and search using the phrases: "history of China" & "traditional China" or "Chinese art" to see what you will find.  The numerous resources, especially those based in institutional websites, can help you to develop a broader perspective about the study of Chinese history and culture.
    * Various ancillary readings presented in class or assigned by Prof. Lai Qing Yan--these are brief, supplemental readings designed to illustrate features of Chinese culture or history.
**Course Requirements**  
    * Regular attendance and participation in the class meetings.  (Heed the university attendance policy.)
    * Two semester examinations and a final examination. (October 9, November 13, December 13)
    * Frequent quizzes on Chinese cultural and linguistic topics.
    * A written review of _Wild Swans_. (November 20)
    * An analytical and evaluative semester essay on a topic assigned by the professor.   The essay may focus on topics in recent Chinese history, particularly as discussed in recent print media, including books in the Jarrett Library.  Class discussions, lectures, films, and other activities will contribute to your perspective on Chinese history.  (December 13)
  
A journal emphasizing personal participation and reflection on the course
content and process, particularly your experiences and insights.  The journal
can, and should, have the characteristics also of a resource guide and
scrapbook as you assemble various written materials, references and artifacts
during your study of Chinese history. (December 13)

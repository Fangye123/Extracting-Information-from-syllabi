**Covering Government  
**

* * *

The Florida state constitution requires that municipalities may be
"established or abolished and their charters amended pursuant to general or
special law." This means the legislature has the power to control operation of
a city, abolish it, or it may amend the charter--- or in other words, its
constitution--- which governs it.

* * *

_Two Ways to Establish a Municipality_

  * Legislature grants specific charter under state law, usually a special law pertaining to only one city.
  * Citizens in an area establish a city under a general charter, as provided by state law.

* * *

_Three Types of City Government in Florida_

  * Council-manager (weak mayor; e.g., Coral Gables or South Miami)
  * Commission (no mayor)
  * Mayor-council (strong mayor; e.g., Hialeah or Miami)

Cities choose their own basic type, but most cities are a blend of these
types. For more information, consult a state reference book such as _The
Florida Almanac_.

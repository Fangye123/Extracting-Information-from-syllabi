**Additional guidelines:**

 1\. Do not expect for the class discussions and reading to be repetitive. You
are expected to read and understand the text. If you do not understand please
ask in class or visit my office during posted hours. If these are not
convenient, you may make an appointment and I will be happy to discuss any
segment of the class or the text. You may wish to bring a friend for a "study
session" in my office which is often enjoyable as well as instructive for
students and for me.  
---  
 2\. Do not ask or expect for make-up tests to be given in any other way than
they are given for everybody. Although make-up tests are not advised, be aware
that there is no penalty for taking the make-up other than the time at which
it is administered. Students who are ill or who have family emergencies may
choose to take the make up as may students who are simply unprepared. There is
no curve and there is no extra credit in this class.  
 3\. Study assistance is available on the campus. Please ask me or check with
the CAPS Center.  
 4\. Grades on pop quizzes will be added to your test grades. Pop quizzes can
only help, not hurt your grade point average. For every question answered
correctly on a pop quiz, you will receive 2 points to be added to your test
grade. There is no penalty for missing a pop quiz. There are no make-up
quizzes. Pop quizzes are given in the first few minutes of selected class
period. If you are late, you may not take the quiz.  
 5\. Be mindful of the last day to withdraw if you are having academic
difficulties.  
 6\. Cheating is a serious offense. Anyone who chooses to engage in academic
dishonesty will fail this course. The college may take further sanctions.  
7\. Grades may be determined in part by multiple choice tests. Read questions
carefully and take your time. There are often scenarios describing political
behavior followed by three to five questions with up to ten possible
responses. Simply studying terms and phrases at the end of chapters will not
suffice for exam preparation. Note that the later exams weigh more heavily on
your grade. This is intended to allow you to get used to test taking early
while less of your grade is in the balance.  
  
All policy papers and essays should be typed, double spaced and stapled in the
upper left corner. No large fonts, colorful paper, or fancy folders please.  
---  
I may not get to know you all personally, but please feel free to come by my
office during office hours if I can help you with the course or your
adjustment to college. Please note that your opinions are valued in class, as
are the opinions of others. Speak up when you feel you have something to
contribute, but also be willing to listen to others.  
  
**Policy Paper Guidelines:**

 Papers should include the following:  
---  
  
  * A discussion of the policy under consideration or as adopted. 
  * A history of the development of the policy including other policies used to deal with similar or the same issue. Be sure to note partisan leanings, policy proponents/critics and interest group interest in the policy. If available use public opinion polls in this section. 
  * An overview of alternatives to the policy that is being adopted or considered. 
  * A critique of the policy adopted or a recommendation among alternatives being considered. 
  
  
You may use newspapers, periodicals or more academic sources for your paper. A
good source is the Congressional Quarterly weekly report, which has an
overview of many policies being considered at the national level. Since this
is a course in national government, you MAY NOT USE LOCAL OR STATE ONLY ISSUES
(such as local taxes). You may use issues that are mostly judicial in nature,
but that might make the task more difficult for you.  
  
 Some suggested topics:

  * MFN status for China. 
  * The tobacco tax. 
  * Campaign finance reform. 
  * National Flood insurance. 
  * Education IRA 
  * Elimination of Social Security 
  * Balanced Budget Amendment 

Check the editorial pages of major newspapers for other topics.  
  
  
**Essay guidelines**   Each student will write an essay dealing with one topic
discussed in class. Choose one of the following topics/questions, for which
possible answers/solutions/debatable positions are suggested by class
readings, discussions or outside readings. It is anticipated that outside
citations will be used to defend positions and provide evidence to suppot
theses in the essays. Essays may be turned in at any time during the semester,
but must be received by Nov. 24, 1998.  
---  
  
  * The US Constitution was offered first as a solutions to the problems of the states under the Articles of Confederation. Argue that the Constitution was originally a document written for states, not as a document for individual citizens. Describe how/whether this has changed. 
  * Argue that federalism works best/worst when states' rights are emphasized. You may use a single policy as a case study in your answer. 
  * We know that education and age are positively related to turnout, and that the US population is more educated and older than in previous generations. Explain why, in spite of these facts, turnout is lower than it has ever been. Use data on turnout to support your thesis. 
  * Explain why the US is dominated by only two political parties, why third parties have such difficulty in the US, and what potential forces might create a more powerful third party. 
  * Describe the evidence of and reasons for decline in the power of American political parties. 
  * Argue that the bureaucracy constitutes a fourth branch of government with its own system of checks and balances and its own constitutionally and administratively derived powers. 
  * Describe how Georgia's constitution differs from the US constitution as well as constitutions of other states. 
  * Argue that the judicial branch is the weakest of the three branches of government at the federal level. 
  * Explain why public opinion is/is not and should/should not be used as a guide for public policy. 
  * Trace the historical and political themes behind one current event.

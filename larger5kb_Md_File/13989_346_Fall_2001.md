Course Description and Objectives  
This seminar is designed to introduce students of the liberal arts to the
sources and historiography of the European Reformation. It treats the
Reformation both as a significant social and political revolution and as a
defining moment in the history of Christian theology. Major themes include:
late Medieval Christendom and the origins of the Reformation; the Reformation
and Renaissance humanism; Martin Luther and the Lutheran Reformation; the
Swiss Reformation and the origins of the Reformed tradition; the Radical
Reformation; the Reformation and the family; and the Catholic Reformation. In
addition to increasing your understanding of the Reformation, the course is
designed to strengthen your skills of historical analysis and interpretation
and improve your research and writing skills.

Grades  
Final grades will be based on an evaluation of the following.  
  
1\. Two mid-term exams (15% each) and a final exam (20%)  
  

Exams will consist of essay questions. Each of the three exams will cover
roughly one-third of the course; the third exam will also include a
comprehensive section.

2\. A research paper submitted in two drafts (15% for the first draft and 25%
for the second)  
  

The research paper can be on any topic in Reformation history. Papers are to
be analytical and interpretive; they should present a thesis and develop an
argument. You are encouraged to use primary sources, and you are expected to
examine the historiographical context of your topic. First drafts may be
limited to sources available in the Duggan Library, but you are expected to
use Interlibrary Loan to obtain additional sources for the final draft. You
should include with your first draft a bibliography based on a universal
search for sources. The grade of each draft will be based on the quality of
the thesis and argument, the quality of the evidence and logic, and the
quality of the writing. You should consult with me about your paper at least a
week before each draft is due.

Three guides to research in Reformation history have been placed on the
library reserve: (1) Steven Ozment, ed., _Reformation Europe: A Guide to
Research_ , (2) William Maltby, ed., _Reformation Europe: A Guide to Research
II_ , (3) John O'Malley, ed., _Catholicism in Early Modern History : A Guide
to Research_. For reference, _The Encyclopedia of the Reformation_ and
_Dictionary of the Middle Ages_ , both available in the reference area of the
Duggan Library, are valuable sources. You should also consult with the
[Research and Writing](http://history.hanover.edu/res.html) pages of the
History Department web site.

3\. Class participation (10%)  
  

The success of this class depends upon the quality of the dialogue in class.
It is expected that you will attend every class and that you will be fully
prepared to discuss the material assigned for that day. Class participation
grades will reflect your attendance record, the frequency of your
contributions to class discussions, and the quality of your questions,
observations, and conclusions.

**Course description**  
  
Last year's national uproar over Ebonics makes plain that how African
Americans speak, or are thought to speak, continues to be a touchstone of U.S.
racial politics and identity. The Ebonics debate is part of a larger ongoing
struggle (mainly but not exclusively between black and white Americans) to
define, represent, and control African American English. Placing our
discussion in historical context, we will explore how African Americans'
language has been represented in literature, popular culture (including film,
music, and television), political discourse, the news media, and scholarly
research.  
  
The readings include oral and written texts, both primary (that is, those that
represent African American English linguistically, by using it as the language
of the text) and secondary (that is, those that represent African American
English rhetorically, by taking it as the subject of the text). We will give
special attention to linguists' descriptions of what is variously termed Black
English Vernacular or African American Vernacular English, although rather
than view these texts as objective authorities, we will subject them to the
same critical scrutiny that we will apply to all other representations of
African American English.  
  
Throughout the course our discussions will be guided by two central questions:
(1) How are the linguistic resources of African American English (or, more
accurately, African American Englishes) used in the production of black and
white racial identities; and (2) How does the rhetoric of race emerge from
discourse about the language of African Americans?

**Participation.** As a seminar, the class will be guided largely by students
rather than the instructor. It is therefore crucial that you come to class
with the readings done and with things to say about them. If you do not
usually participate in class discussions, be assured that there will be
painless opportunities to speak (e.g., in small groups or pairs) throughout
the semester.  
  
**Critical analysis.** To prepare you for your final paper, you will do three
short analytic assignments early in the semester. These assignments will help
you develop crucial analytic skills and may also help you formulate ideas for
your final paper. All assignments should be typed, double-spaced, with
reasonable font size and margins. Special linguistic characters may be
inserted by hand if necessary. Assignments are distributed on Tuesdays and are
due on the following Friday (i.e., 10 days later) before 5 p.m. in the
envelope marked "ENGL/LING 481" outside 217 Blocker. They can also be turned
in during class. Late assignments will be penalized.  
  
**Leading discussion.** You will sign up to lead a 30-minute class discussion
of one reading/viewing assignment (usually with one other student). These
discussions will always take place on Tuesdays. The task of the discussion
leaders is to facilitate discussion through effective guidance, not to
dominate it. Creative approaches to this goal, such as presentations,
activities, audio-visual materials, and other aids, are encouraged. Additional
information will be distributed later in the course.  
  
**Research paper.** The ultimate goal of the course is for each student to
develop and write an original research paper on some aspect of the material.
You will prepare to write your paper in several stages, each of them graded
separately: (1) the proposal, a brief statement of your topic; (2) an
annotated bibliography of relevant sources; (3) a 15-minute oral presentation
of your research project; (4) an 8-10 page research paper. As with the
analytic assignments, the research assignments you turn in are due no later
than the following Friday before 5 p.m. and should be typed, double-spaced,
with reasonable font size and margins. Due dates for each step appear on the
syllabus. Suggested topics and detailed guidelines for each part of the
research process will be distributed later.  
  
**A note on the readings.** Some of the readings that you will encounter,
especially early in the course, will be somewhat technical. However, the
information they contain will be invaluable to you later when you assess other
readings. If you have some experience with linguistics they will be easier to
understand, but even if you don't, don't despair. I will provide supplementary
materials to guide you through the crucial parts, and I don't expect you to
master every technical nuance. In addition, we will be reading these texts
critically; if you don't like the way they present material, bring your
comments to class discussion.

    Copies of all of the above books will be on reserve at Odegaard Library. There may be additional required readings assigned during the course of the quarter. These will either be hand-outs, and/or will be available on the web site at <http://courses.washington.edu/hist112>

### Learning Objectives:

    In addition to acquiring an understanding of the historical development of western European civilization during the middle ages, students will learn: 

  1. To analyze primary sources for the historical evidence they can provide. 
  2. To construct historical arguments based upon this primary source evidence. 
  3. To evaluate competing historical arguments using primary source evidence. 
  4. To appreciate the distance between historical evidence and historical interpretations of that evidence. 

### Course Requirements:

    

  1. **Lectures.** Unrelenting attendance at lectures is expected. Material covered in lectures is not covered in the textbook. In my lectures, I will presume you already know the textbook material assigned for that day. You need therefore to have completed the reading assigned for each day before the lecture. The lectures are also very tightly integrated. You will not understand later lectures if you miss too many of the earlier ones. Nor can you expect to do well in this course if you only attend two or three lectures per week. You really must plan to be here every day, except when illness or emergency strikes. Please note also that I do not permit ASUW notetakers in my classes. No ASUW notes-for-purchase will be available for this class.  

  2. **Discussion Sections.** Fridays will be devoted to discussion of the primary source materials that you will have read over the week. These discussion sections are a required and essential part of the course. They are not an optional extra. Learning how to analyze these sources is a primary objective of this course. Do not expect that sections will summarize the lectures for you; in this class, that is not their purpose. Sections will cover material that is not covered in the lectures or in the textbooks. Sections will account for 15% of your final grade: on a 4.0 scale, that is .6. That is a lot.  

  3. **Grades and Assignments.** Grades will be calculated on the following basis: 
    * 10% for the first paper (2-3 pages, assigned topic) 
    * 15% for the mid-term exam 
    * 15% for work in discussion sections 
    * 30% for the final paper (4-6 pages, on a topic chosen from a list of suggested topics) 
    * 30% for the final exam (essay exam)  
      
Both papers will ask you to analyze primary source materials. The first paper
will be based upon a close reading of a single primary source. It will be due
Monday, July 9. The second paper will ask you to analyze one or more of the
primary source documents in the Geary reader. It will be due on Friday August
10. Late papers will be penalized .2 per day, unless you have been granted an
extension in advance. The weekend will count as 2 days. This penalty is
designed to ensure that all students have precisely the same amount of time to
complete assignments. You must attempt and turn in all four graded assignments
(first paper, mid-term, second paper and final exam) in order to pass this
class.

### Instructor Availability

    I will hold regular office hours on Tuesdays right after class, but I would prefer to meet with you by appointment at a time that is mutually convenient.

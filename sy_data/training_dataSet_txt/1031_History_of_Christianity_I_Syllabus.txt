Course Requirements
There will be THREE examinations, worth 100 points each, that collectively
will comprise 65% of the course grade (20+20+25). An additional 25% will
be earned from a term paper. This assignment consists of a research paper
of approximately 10-15 pages on any significant Christian individual, movement
or group that functioned between the fourth and the fifteenth centuries.
The paper will, in addition, contain footnotes and a bibliography constructed
in accordance with the University of Central Arkansas, Department of History
Style
Sheet. A minimum of ten sources must be cited, of which at least two
have to be monographs, and two articles in scholarly journals. Ten per
cent of the grade will be based upon quizzes, class participation and oral
reports. In addition, students are requested to obtain a UCA e-mail account.
Aims and Objectives
History of Christianity I introduces the student to some of  the
important personages, institutions, ideas, movements and conflicts that
are associated with the development of Christianity as an historical movement
within the Roman Empire and then during the European Middle Ages. Chronologically,
the course spans the first fifteen centuries of the Christian era. The
student will come to understand how religion and society intersect.
Course Policies
Class attendance is required; students who accumulate more than four
absences are liable to dismissal from class. Late arrivals and/or early
departures count as a class absence. Cell phones and paging devices must
be turned off during class. Instances of academic dishonesty will bear
the penalty of a zero grade on the assignment or activity in question.

    RABBINICS 263
    A Study of Midrash Pirqei Rabbi Eliezer
    
    
    The purpose of this course is to provide the student with an opportunity to gain in-depth 
    knowledge of the style of the Narrative Midrashim, in general, and of Pirqei Rabbi Eliezer, in 
    particular.  We will not only analyze selected passages from the main work of this genre of 
    Midrash, PRE, but we will also read and discuss some of the key secondary works which deal 
    with the questions pertaining to this volume.  In addition, though our main focus will be Pirqei 
    Rabbi Eliezer, we will attempt to touch on some other narrative midrashic works as well.
    
    
    1. COURSE REQUIREMENTS
    
    a. Preparation of the required text assignments - Students must be ready to analyze in class any 
    passage due on a particular day.  Text assignments are meant to provide each student with a 
    chance to hone his/her own textual skills outside of class, as well as in the classroom.  It is 
    recommended that groups of students work together in preparing text material and that the 
    passage be prepared with an eye towards:  general comprehension, exegetic techniques and 
    structural details, changes in the narrative line, possible sources and parallel versions, the major 
    themes emphasized and the possible contextual factors which created them.
    
    b. Collateral Readings - Required secondary literature is to be read PRIOR to the discussion of 
    the related topics in class.  All students will be asked to participate in the class discussions.
    
    c. Text Analysis - Students will be asked to analyze in-depth the starred(*) text assignment from 
    Pirqei Rabbi Eliezer (Chapter 20) prior to study of this material in class. Analysis should entail 
    consideration of (1) the major themes analyzed; (b) the thematic flow of the material and its 
    editing; (3) the usage of the basic text from Genesis and the balance with midrashic material; and 
    (4) possible sources used.  This written analysis is due when the text is studied in class.
    
    
    d. Term Paper - The major requirement of the course is the preparation of a well thought-out, 
    well-researched, and well-written essay which is due on December 31, 1998.  Select a biblical 
    character, narrative (or part thereof, if it is too long), or event which is treated in Pirqei Rabbi 
    Eliezer, but not covered in the textual assignments.  Analyze the passage from the point of view 
    of the (1) motifs present and the major thematic thrusts; (2) possible sources of the PRE material 
    (other rabbinics compilations, Aprocrypha-Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, Christianity, 
    Islamic works, etc.) and how this source material is utilized; (3) the nature of the editing of the 
    material; and (4) possible contextual factors and parallels in the Islamic material which would 
    account for the selection and shaping of the PRE material.  The papers should be approximately 
    15 pages in length and your projected topics should be submitted to the instructor no later than 
    December 1st.

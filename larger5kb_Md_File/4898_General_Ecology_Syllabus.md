Ecology is the scientific study of the interactions between organisms and
their environments. The goal of ecology is to explain the distribution and
abundance of organisms in nature through an understanding of how organisms
interact with their abiotic and biotic environments. This has included
quantitative studies conducted at the level of the organism, population,
community and ecosystem. Early in the development of the field, ecologists
were motivated primarily by the pure intellectual pleasure of observing and
then explaining the natural world through scientific experimentation. In the
past few decades, ecologists have watched their field sites disappear or
become degraded. This coincided with the birth of the environmental movement.
Today, a new generation of ecologists is motivated not only by the desire to
understand nature but also by the desire to protect and restore the very
things being studied. This has not only changed the direction of ecological
study, but has also forced many scientists to enter the political,
sociological and economic arenas.

In BIOL 2010, we will focus on the quantitative and experimental science of
ecology. We will closely examine theory and experimental studies that attempt
to explain how organisms interact with each other and their environment. This
will be achieved through lectures, readings, field work and lab work, and
writing. Our goal is to develop a conceptual framework that may be used to
pose and answer relevant questions in ecology and to develop an appreciation
for the special challenges involved in ecological studies. Although we will
focus primarily on the purely scientific aspects of ecology, we will also
spend some time applying these basic ideas to applied areas, such as
environmental and conservation biology. Students should come to the class with
a basic background in biology and mathematics, a strong interest in the
scientific process and the desire to participate in field exercises.

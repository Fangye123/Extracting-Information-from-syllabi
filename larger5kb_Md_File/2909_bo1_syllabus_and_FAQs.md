1\. _The Course: Its Purpose and Prerequisites._ Economics B-01 is the basic
introduction to economics that must be taken by every prospective economics
major. Economics B-01 is also taken by many other students as a distribution
requirement, as a requirement in some other fields and schools, and just
because it is an interesting course about the real world out there. **Please
note: there are no prerequisites for Economics B-01**.

2\. _Required Reading_. Books are available both at Norris and at SBX. See the
attached assignment list. Let me and/or the TAs know promptly of any shortages
of books.

3\. _Advice_. If you don't understand a particular point in the lecture, come
up and ask after class. For questions about the text, problems, and readings,
talk to the TA in the section meeting or in their office hours. You will also
find that many of your questions only take a minute or two to answer, and for
these you should come up after class rather than making a special trip to
office hours, either mine or those of the TAs. You can also reach me by e-mail
(address above).

4\. _Website_. My web site (address above) has several sections, one of which
involves teaching. No material concerning the current course is provided on
the web site; any supplementary material beyond the assigned reading will be
distributed in the form of paper handouts in lectures. Instead, the purpose of
the teaching section of the web site is to provide questions and answers from
past midterms and final exams.

5\. _Notes on Lectures and TA Sections_. The lectures will mix an explanation
of the most important textbook material, and presentation and solution of
questions and problems, with lots of comments and examples showing how the
textbook model(s) apply to some of the great macro issues of today and
yesterday. TA sections will administer quizzes and discuss answers, provide
sample test questions prior to the midterm and final, and present additional
explanations of topics for which there is insufficient time in lectures.

6\. _Requirements_.  
a. _Short Quizzes_ (5). In TA sections on the dates indicated on the schedule.
Counts 30 percent of grade.  
b. _Midterm_. Monday, 29 October. Counts 20 percent of grade.  
c. _Final_. Monday, 10 December, 9-11 pm. Counts 50 percent of grade.

* * *

_IMPORTANT NOTE: A pocket calculator must be brought to each quiz, midterm and
to the final exam. You must write your answers to the essay questions on the
final exam in PEN; pencil is not acceptable._

REQUIRED READING AND INSTRUCTIONS

* * *

Text:  |  Foundations of Macroeconomics_ (2002), Addison-Wesley (B-P).  
---|---  
Workbook:  |  Neil Garston, Tom Larson, and Mark Rush, _Study Guide for Bade-
Parkin, Macroeconomics_ (2002), Addison-Wesley (S).  
Required  
Additional Reading:  |  Paul Krugman, _The Age of Diminished Expectations_ ,
third edition (1997), MIT Press (K).  
  
All books are available in paperback. The Bade-Parkin book and study guide are
brand new and are not available used. Used copies of the Krugman book should
be available easily. Buying a copy of the textbook gives you a code number for
access to the textbook publisher's web site, which contains numerous teaching
aides including an electronic version of the study guide. Buying the textbook
and Krugman book are required; if you find the electronic version of the study
guide adequate, you do not need to buy the print version.  

HOW TO READ:  
  
Your aim with the theoretical parts of the text and workbook is to absorb the
content completely and precisely so that you can answer test questions
accurately. Your aim with the examples and other material in the textbook and
with the Krugman book is quite different -- to broaden your knowledge by
absorbing some perspective of history, recent events, attitudes, and opinions.
You read these items for general points rather than specific details. Learn to
read actively, by asking yourself continually "how do these readings relate to
each other and to the lectures?" Please note: The Parkin text contains
interviews with economists at the beginning of each major part C these are not
a required part of the course, although those of you thinking about majoring
in economics can read the interviews to learn more about what economics is
about and how professional economists think.

Frequently Asked Questions:

Q: Are there any prerequisites.  
A: No, just Economics B-01.

Q: Do I need to be skilled in math?  
A: The only math used in Economics B-01 is a tiny bit of junior high school
algebra in two or three of the lectures. You need to be comfortable with math
to become an economics major, but in Economics B-01 you don't have to face
that decision yet.

Q: How do I sign up for my section?  
A: There will be sign-up sheets at the first class on Tuesday, September 21.
Any late-comers can sign up at the lecture on Wednesday, September 22. After
that, any requests for changes in TA sections must be addressed to Prof.
Gordon before or after class.

Q: Where is this algebra?  
A: I find hardly any math in the textbook at all. The textbook to be used in
Fall 2001 is a simplified version of our usual textbook, chosen because it is
current and relatively up-to-date. The usual textbook contains several
algebraic appendices which will be distributed (in the form of paper handouts)
and discussed in lectures, and this material will be included in quizzes,
midterm, and final.

Q: Can I show up for any section I want regardless of what I've signed up for?  
A: No, you must come to the section you've signed up for, except for sickness.
Your TA is responsible for you and your grade, and to be fair to the TAs we
try to maintain a rough balance of enrollment in the six sections

Q: Any tips on which section to sign up for?  
A: Most important, if you have band trips or some other outside activity on
Friday, don't sign up for a Friday section. Otherwise, sign up for the section
that is most convenient geographically and most compatible with your other
obligations and activities.

Q: Important dates?  
A: P/N Deadline, Friday, October 12.  
Drop Deadline, Friday, November 2 (you'll know your midterm grade by then).

Q: Can I add now?  
A: Yes, there is no limit on enrollment in this course.

Q: What happens if I miss a quiz?  
A: If illness or an extracurricular activity forces you to miss a quiz, your
grades on the other quizzes will be averaged and applied to your missing
grade. However, only one quiz can be missed and given credit in this way. You
will receive zero credit for any other missed quiz. There are no make-ups for
quizzes. To be fair to people who take all five quizzes, their lowest grade of
the five will be dropped (Hint: this is an incentive to take all five
quizzes).

Q: What's the point of the quizzes?  
A: Two: first, to give you an incentive to keep up with the reading, and
second, to give you practice on exactly the same kinds of questions that will
be asked on the midterm and final. Quizzes will cover any material covered in
lecture up to the Wednesday in that same week.

Q: What's the point of the Study Guide?  
A: The Study Guide has a complete set of questions involving all the concepts
in the text. Some of these will be assigned for discussion in TA sections.
Normally, there will be insufficient time to discuss all these questions. The
more Study Guide questions you work out (most involve filling in blanks and
working out numerical answers), the faster and easier you will find it to
answer questions on quizzes, the midterm, and final. Try to answer the Study
Guide questions "cold", after skimming the textbook once. Any inability to
answer the Study Guide questions at that point will be an excellent signal of
what you haven't understood, and what you need to go back and review in the
text.

Q: Should I concentrate on the text's End-of-Chapter questions and problems,
or on the Study Guide?  
A: Both.

Q: Where are the answers to the text's End-of-Chapter problems?  
A: These answers will be put up on my web site by the end of the second week
of class.

Q: What about the publisher's web site?  
A: The problem with textbook publisher web sites is that students are forced
to buy a new book in order to obtain a password to use the site. Normally in
any class some students buy new books and others buy used books, hence lacking
the password. In this class, the book is brand new and so everyone will have
the password and access to the web site. The study guide is available on the
web site, so you do not have to buy it unless you prefer to have your own
printed copy to mark up (highly recommended). Also, there are numerous study
aids available on the web site which will help you understand the material.
Clearly, the more different ways you study and the more time you put in, the
better you will do.

Q: What happens if I miss the midterm?  
A: The midterm is administered in the lecture time on October 25. If you are
not free at 2pm every Monday, including October 25, then you should not be
taking this course.

Q: Will there be essay questions on the midterm or is it all objective?  
A: No essay questions on the midterm. But, beware. While many of the questions
will come from the textbook's test bank, others will not and will be based on
the Krugman reading and the lectures' linkages between the Krugman reading and
textbook material.

Q: Where do I find past midterm and final exams?  
A: On my web site.

Q: What happens if I fall suddenly ill and cannot take the midterm?  
A: You must leave a message on my office answering machine (491-3616) or with
the Economics department (491-5140); the latter is open 8:30am - 5pm only,
whereas my office answering machine operates 24 hours per day. You will get an
automatic F on the midterm if you don't show up and haven't notified one of
those two phone numbers beforehand.

Q: What happens if I miss the final?  
A: You get an incomplete in the course. There are no alternative arrangements
made to take the final at any time other than that listed in the official
registrar's schedule. Do not repeat the mistake of occasional students in the
past by reserving your homebound airplane travel for the Christmas vacation
too early to attend all your final exams, not just the final in this course.

Q: Do I need to come to lectures? Can't I just read the textbook and do the
exercises?  
A: The lectures will make it easier to read the textbook and get good grades
on the quizzes and tests. More important, there will be much discussion in the
lectures to link together and integrate issues raised in the Krugman book with
the framework of the text. And there will be lots of comments on the current
international crisis in Japan, Southeast Asia, Latin America, and Russia,
covering material that is not in any of the readings. The tests are not based
simply on problems from the textbook; additional questions on both the midterm
and the final will test your understanding of the relations between the
Krugman reading, the lectures, and the text.

Q: How do I get a good grade?  
A: Recipe:  
(1) Skim the textbook and any assignment from Krugman before the lecture  
(2) Read the text carefully and do the assigned study guide questions before
the quizzes given in TA section.  
(3) Read the assigned chapters in the Krugman book before the midterm and
final, since questions will be based partly on the Krugman book both on the
midterm and final. There will be no questions from Krugman on the quizzes.  
(4) Come to lecture, since the lectures will highlight the most important
things to learn from the text, develop the graphs in a way that makes them
much easier to understand than just reading the text, and will provide
numerous hints as to the type of questions to be asked on the quizzes.

Q: Is there a Web Site for this course?  
A: It contains answers to end-of-chapter questions, and test questions from
Fall 1998, the only previous time that I have taught Econ B01. Lecture notes
and lecture handouts are not available on the web site; much of the handout
material consists of xeroxes from secondary material which I receive in print,
not electronically, so it is not practicable to put handouts on the web site.

Q: I've done the reading and thought about the material but I am still so
confused that I don't even know what to ask. Should I feel embarrassed about
coming to office hours for help?  
A: Not at all. If you have done the reading, office hours are an excellent
time to clear up big or small questions. But don't come until you've done the
assigned reading on the topic you plan to ask about. The TA office hours are
spread out during the week, and if you have a conflict, you can go to another
TA's office hours if you can't go to see your own TA.

Finally, remember that many questions of clarification can be asked by raising
your hand in lectures and/or by coming up to talk to me after lectures. I
never leave the lecture room until every student has departed.

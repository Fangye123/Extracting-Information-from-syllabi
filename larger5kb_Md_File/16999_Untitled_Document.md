This course is constructed to provide graduate students with an introduction
to the study of higher education institutions. Primarily, the course's
objectives include developing some understanding of

  * the United States higher education landscape;
  * the importance and function of different higher education institutional types;
  * the federal and state governmental role in higher education; and
  * current and forecasted problems for higher education.

The course and its assignments will also serve as a training ground for
developing professional writing skills. The text _Everyday Writer_ (available
at the University of Kansas Bookstore or online) __ is recommended for
students who would like to improve their academic writing.

This course will function as a seminar. Toward that end, class meetings will
be centered around discussions of assigned readings. Students should come to
class prepared to discuss assigned readings or related material on current
issues. Frequently, class meetings will include a discussion of a current
issue "in the news" in higher education or a hypothetical case study.

All assignments for this course should be typed or laser-printed, double-
spaced and constructed according to APA (American Psychological Association)
guidelines. An APA Manual is available for sale in the bookstore and at the
reference desk at Watson Library. Students are expected to turn in assignments
on time.

Many new graduate students have concerns regarding their writing. KU has
satellite writing centers called Writer's Roosts. The consultants there will
work with you as you prepare drafts of papers; they do not edit your papers,
but they do help you meet the goals of your assignments. Writer's Roosts are
open in several locations across campus; please check
http://www.ukans.edu/~writing for current locations and hours. Drop-ins and
appointments are welcomed, and there is no charge for services. For more
information, call 864-2399 or writing@raven.cc.ukans.edu.

Read and understand University of Kansas standards on academic misconduct,
especially those relevant to plagiarism. See Article II, Section 6 of the
Rules and Regulations of the University Senate for definitions and policies
concerning academic misconduct. When in doubt, cite.

**Grading policy**

I will use the School of Education's grading scheme (A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C)
where

"A"=An insightful, comprehensive, clearly-communicated, impressive assignment

"B"=An assignment that meets but does not exceed the basic requirements of the
assignment, but is reasonably clear in its expression and construction.

"C"=An assignment significantly below expectations in its clarity, content and
construction.

* * *

**Class assignments**

1\. For each class, completion of all required readings prior to attending
class..

2\. Identify 2-3 questions of your choosing based on the week's readings or
your reading of the _Chronicle_. Please bring these to class and make sure you
get the opportunity to answer them.

The quality of this class is largely a function of your preparation, interest,
and active participation. This is your class, please bring to our attention
your questions, comments and reactions to assigned readings or relevant higher
education topics. Because your active participation is required in this
course, this component of the course will be worth 20% of your final grade.

**Written Assignments**

The **first assignment** requires you to travel the World Wide Web to visit
2-3 distinctive colleges or universities. I would recommend that you choose
institutions unlike each other in terms of geography, student demographics,
size, and mission. Treat your virtual visit as you would a physical visit to
each of these campuses.

Using the information gleaned from your virtual visits, construct a short
(12-14 pages) report that details, for a lay audience, the significant
differences (e.g., in terms of environment, resources for students, student
life, demographics, selectivity, clientele) between the institutions you have
visited and explains the relevance of these differences for students (and
different types of students). For this purpose, use specific information from
our course discussions and readings as well your analysis of your web visits.

Your report is _due on October 17th_ and is worth 25% of your final grade.

Try for a listing of colleges and universities. The Carnegie Foundation also
provides a online resource for classifying colleges and universities at
http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/Classification/index.htm.

For your **second assignment,** you will be asked to respond to a case
detailing a problem faced by a specific college or university. Your response
to the case should draw from Birnbaum's discussion of managing and leading
colleges, as well as his discussion of different college organizational
models.

The case will be handed out to you on November 1st. Your response is _due on
November 21st_ and is worth 25% of your final grade.

The **third assignment** is to construct a 16-20 page paper that identifies
2-3 of the most important challenges facing higher education in the next 20
years, and explains how higher education institutions can best meet those
challenges. The paper should use course readings as well as supplementary
resources that identify specific changes in higher education's goals, students
and resources.

This paper should include concrete descriptions of a) the important challenges
identified; b) how these challenges have developed over time; c) how these
challenges will force colleges and universities to change/adapt; and d) ways
in which colleges or universities might positively meet these challenges.
Acknowledging the important differences between institutional types, the paper
should also include how the identified challenges will affect unique
institutional types and their constituents.

The third assignment is _due on December 19th_ and is worth 30% of your final
grade.

generalizations based on artificial criteria that we establish for the purpose
of constructing regions

> physical  
>  economic  
>  historical  
>  cultural (religion, language, political, other)  
>  population clusters  
>  combinations of criteria

**PROPERTIES:**

> area  
>  location  
>  boundaries are transition zones  
>  boundaries change

**QUESTIONS:**

> 1\. Where is the realm or region?  
>  2\. What criteria is being used to designate this region?  
>  3\. How is the realm significantly different from adjacent realm?  
>  (i.e. explain the boundary or transition zones between realms.)

# Exam 1 Review

### To prepare for the exam:

\- keep your Study Guide open to the Objectives, Vocabulary, and other
information  
\- pay close attention to the THEMES, again, see the Study Guide (p. 47)  
\- you should have already read the material (Intro, 8, 7, handouts), if not
READ!  
\- take notes as you read, see the Objectives in the Study Guide AGAIN!  
\- read your class notes  
\- prepare study notes of each objective and vocabulary word

### These study notes should summarize your class notes and textbook

Remember, I do not stress simple memorization, but rather my exam questions
will require the APPLICATION of the terms and concepts we have studied. In
order to do this you do need some facts. These you get from the readings. But
as you read, or review, try to fit the material into our four themes. Take
notes that relate the readings to the themes and objectives. This should be
work. Reading, if it is easy, really isn't learning.

The exam will have a variety of question types: Multiple Choice, Short Answer,
Essay, Map Work, Lists, Definitions, etc. Those listed here are JUST EXAMPLES.
Do not just prepare answers to them. These should be used as a guide so that
you can see if you are prepared. If you could not answer SIMILAR types of
questions on DIFFERENT issues covered in class then you are NOT ready. If all
you do is look up the answers to these questions you will not pass. If, AFTER
STUDYING all the material, you could answer all of these questions easily, you
are probably ready.

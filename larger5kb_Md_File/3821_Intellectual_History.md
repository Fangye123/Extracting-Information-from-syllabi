**FINAL EXAM:   See Master schedule**

  Return to Table of Contents

**_Course Requirements_** :  Two take-home mid-term exams, a final exam, and a
research paper are the written requirements for this course.  In addition,
each student will give a class presentation as part of the process of
preparing the research paper (see below).  This presentation will be graded
together with the research paper, which will receive an automatic zero if not
accompanied by an oral presentation.  Failure to complete any of the written
requirements will be regarded as a failure to complete the course, and will
therefore result in an automatic grade of F.  Each student will prepare a
statement of his or her paper topic, with projected bibliography.  This
statement will not be graded, but failure to hand it in will result in a loss
of seven points on the final grade.  Papers received in the week after the due
date, 5 p.m. on April 7, will be marked down up to one full grade.  Absolutely
no papers will be accepted after 5 p.m. on April 14.

Exams must be turned in by the deadline.  Extensions and make-ups will be
arranged only by prior consent of the instructor, and only for the most
compelling reasons (as determined by the instructor).  If a student, without
gaining prior consent, is unable to take an exam due to sudden illness or some
other extraordinary event, the instructor must be notified immediately.  If I
cannot be reached directly or by phone, you must leave a message with the
History Department.  A student's request for an extension or make-up must be
accompanied by a doctor's note or other written documentation.

**Exams:   **The exams are all essay. The mid-terms will contain two essays,
the final exam three, of which one will be comprehensive in nature (covering
the entire course).  General issues that are likely to be the subject of essay
questions will be covered in the review sessions indicated on your weekly
schedule, but the exams may contain other material not discussed in these
sessions.  The exams will be designed to test acquaintance both with the
readings and points raised in class.  The instructor will be looking for
evidence of general knowledge, an organized and analytical approach to that
knowledge, and an ability to combine the raw materials of the course -- text,
discussions, and documentary sources -- into pertinent and meaningful
insights.  On take-home exams, I expect quotes from the primary sources, and
specific references to the textbook.  The instructor will also be evaluating
your ability to communicate your insights.  Points will be taken off for run-
on sentences, grammatical errors, spelling errors, poor punctuation, illegible
handwriting or any other problems that, in the opinion of the instructor,
affect comprehension of the student's work.  Strive above all for clarity.
The two mid-terms must be prepared on a word processor, with margins, fonts
and other physical characteristics conforming to the requirements for the
research paper.  The final will be taken in class (bring a blue book), and
will be three hours long.

**Research Paper** :  The research paper is designed specifically to show that
the student can research a topic and develop an analytical argument using
source materials.  The emphasis should be as much as possible on using
_primary source materials from the period in question_ \-- the writings **of**
Marx or Darwin, not just writings **about** them, beginning with the two
required sourcebooks.   All students should meet with the instructor about
their paper topics, and do so as early as possible in the semester.  Each
student will prepare a one-page written statement of his or her paper topic,
complete with bibliography, by the beginning of week three.  These will then
be distributed to other students in the class, each of whom will prepare a
written critique due by the beginning of week five.  Neither of these
assignments will be graded, but failure to complete either assignment will
result in a deduction of seven points from the final grade.

As part of the research project, each student will give an oral presentation
based on their term paper of fifteen minutes in length (approximately ten full
pages of text, double-spaced) .  In the class period preceding the
presentation, each presenter will give a written outline to the other students
in the class as a basis for class discussion after the presentation.  Class
time will be set aside in the middle of the semester for these presentations,
with the specific time slots to be determined at random by the instructor.
Think of these presentations as a trial run for your paper in progress, and an
opportunity to get critical feedback.  The oral presentation and the paper
will be graded as one assignment.  I will be looking in particular for signs
of improvement or refinement between the oral report and the final written
product.

The final papers _must be printed on a word processor_ , with double-spaced
text, a title page, and one-inch (and no more than one-inch) margins.  The
text (not including bibliography, title page and endnotes page) should be no
less than 10 **full pages** and no more than 12 pages in length.   Your name,
the course name and number, and the date must be on the title page.  It must
include a bibliography of all sources cited.  You may use either endnotes or
footnotes, but if you use the latter, the paper must be sufficiently over the
10 page limit to compensate for the formatting of the notes at the foot of the
page.  Bibliography and footnote or endnote citations must conform to the
proper style for the liberal arts, as defined in Kate Turabian, _A Manual for
Writers of Term Papers, Theses and Dissertations_ , Chicago, 1987.  **Do not
use MLA, APA or any alternative style current in other disciplines.   Unless
you wish to see the instructor fly into a blind rage, do not even _think_ of
using parenthetical notes.**

The type of material that must be documented (i.e. footnoted) includes:
controversial or distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a
matter of broad general knowledge, statistics, all quotes, and paraphrases or
summaries of an author's argument.  All direct quotes over two lines in length
must be indented and single-spaced as described in Turabian.  You should have
at least one footnote per full page of text.

It is imperative that you document source material, but the _argument or
thesis of your paper must be in your own words_ :  excessive use of quotes or
lengthy paraphrasing of sources will not be accepted, and leads easily to the
grievous sin of plagiarism.  On plagiarism, see under "Honor Code" below.  The
citation of at least five different sources is a _minimal_ requirement for the
paper.   In addition to the assigned texts, which you are required to cite,
you must utilize at least three other sources from the library.  These sources
should be scholarly works of article or book length, and/or additional primary
sources.  You may use encyclopedias or other reference works, but they should
not be cited, nor will they be considered a proper substitute for the outside
sources required.

**Class participation** :  Since this is a discussion class, class
participation on the part of all students is vital.  Students must arrive
prepared to discuss the reading assignments.  In order to ensure this, I will
choose one or two students at random at the beginning of each class to be
discussion leaders.  Those students will be graded for their contributions to
the discussion that day.  Any who have not read the material or who are absent
without prior clearance from me will receive a failing grade for that day's
discussion.  I will arrange it so that everyone gets a more or less equal
chance to be "on call".  Voluntary contributions from students not designated
by this system will of course be viewed positively, especially when they
demonstrate acquaintance and engagement with the reading.  Your overall grade
for class participation will not be figured numerically into your final score,
but will weigh heavily nonetheless.  It will be used to decide borderline
cases, offset negative trends like absences, or, if judged to be above your
performance on written work, bump you to a higher grade.  A "B" student who
performs at a "B" level in class will still get a "B", or, at most, a "B+",
depending on other factors.  But a "B" or "B+" student making "A"
contributions in class significantly increases his or her chances of an "A-",
depending on other circumstances.  A student whose contributions in class are
few or show shallow acquaintance with the readings can expect negative
consequences, even with all "A's" on the written assignments.  More than most
classes, a discussion oriented class can succeed only when the students
themselves make a consistent effort.  I reserve the right if necessary to
assign oral reports to facilitate discussion, and to use these reports in the
determination of final grades.

**_Grading_** :  The mid-terms, the final, and the paper are worth 100 points
each.  Your final grade will be determined by the total number of points you
gain out of a maximum of 400, as modified by your class participation grade
(see above).  I do not grade on a curve.  Attendance, in addition to evidence
of progress or lack thereof in the course of the semester, will be factors in
deciding half grades and borderline cases (which, experience shows, means most
students).  Serious attendance problems or misconduct in class can result in a
lowering of grade.  The grading scale is as follows:  
    
  _Score_                     _Grade_          388-400 | A+  
---|---  
         372-387 | A  
         360-371 | A-  
         348-359 | B+  
         332-347 | B  
         320-331 | B-  
         308-319 | C+  
         292-307 | C  
         280-291 | C-  
         268-279 | D+  
         252-267  | D  
         240-251 | D-  
         Below 240 | F  
  


**Extra Credit Assignments** :  Extra credit assignments may be arranged with
the instructor.  These assignments must be approved in advance by the
instructor on or before March 8, and will not be accepted unless so approved.
They are worth a maximum of 40 points.  Under no circumstances will an extra
credit assignment be accepted as substitute for any other written requirement
in the course.  An extra credit assignment can only elevate a student into a
higher grade bracket (for example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored
the higher grade on at least one of the three major exams or on the
presentation/paper.  The assignment must take the form either of an analytical
book review (not a book summary) 5-7 pages in length, or a second documented
paper 7-10 pages in length, and must utilize sources not assigned in this
course.  Style of text, footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to
the guidelines of Turabian.  If you decide to do an extra credit assignment,
it must be turned in no later than April 12 for you to receive credit.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Attendance Policy_** :  Class attendance is a requirement of this course.
Repeated unexcused absences will lead to a reduction of grade.  Unexcused
absences totaling 25% or more of the class meetings will result in an
automatic F for the course.  The instructor will excuse a student only under
the most extraordinary circumstances.  Chronic lateness will also be
penalized, since it presents a class disturbance.  If a student arrives after
roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to place his or her name on
the class roll no later than the end of that class period.  Failure to do so
will result in an unexcused absence, even if the student later produces class
notes or other evidence that he or she was present for all or part of the
class period.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Honor Code and Plagiarism_** :  Students are expected to observe the honor
code, and pledge all work for this course.  Students found to have cheated on
an exam or to have plagiarized material in a paper will be subject to the
maximum penalty under college rules.  For those in doubt about the definition
of plagiarism, it consists of copying passages from a source without both
attribution **and** quotation.   If you have reproduced the language of your
source, you have committed plagiarism whether or not you have cited the source
and the page number.  This includes passages that a student may have modified:
for example, changed verb tenses, omission or replacement of occasional words,
reshuffling of phrases, sentences or paragraphs, combining of different
plagiarized sources.  Writing a bad paper in your own words is far better than
writing a good one using the words of someone else.  One suggestion for
avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts and sources:  close all books when
writing, and consult them only for specific facts or direct quotes.  Also
proofread your paper with plagiarism specifically in mind.

**Taperecording and Class Decorum** :  Taperecording of lectures is not
permitted.  Students who are excused from class by the instructor must make
arrangements with the instructor or with other students to cover the material
missed.  Students who skip class without permission are responsible for making
their own arrangements with other students (not with the instructor) for the
material covered in class.

Students are expected to observe class decorum.  Anyone engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent.  By order of the department chair, food and drinks
are not permitted in the classroom.

###  **Course Description :**

* * *

**The goal of this course is to introduce the student into the world of
archaeology. Modern archaeology combines hands-on experience with high levels
of conceptualization and theory building. It calls upon its practitioners to
be practical and innovative. This course demands active, and timely
participation in discussions, assignments, and projects. Therefore, the this
course will emphasize both the theories behind archaeological practice as well
as lots of hands on learning. I expect regular attendance. More than two
unexcused absences will be penalized. Class participants will be expected to
have read the relevant class materials and to be prepared to discuss them.
There will be[2 class assignments ](an210as.html) representing 25% of total
grade and 3 examinations each worth 25 %. Examinations will include readings,
assigned Web sites, lectures and assigned labs.**

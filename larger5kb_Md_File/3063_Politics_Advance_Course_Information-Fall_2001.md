5\. Political Freedom

Instructor: Peter Euben

Politics 5 meets twice a week. There will be an hour lecture followed by a
45-minute discussion. In addition, there will be an hour-and-ten-minute
discussion section of 15-20 students. There are no exams (I don't believe in
them) and four short papers. You will also be asked to do a one-page response
paper prior to section meetings.

I will have a minimum of three hours of official office hours per week, but I
am perfectly willing to see students outside of them if they cannot make that
time and to have supplementary hours if needed. I have an e-mail address
because I have to, but I do not use e-mail and will **not,** under any
circumstances, short of death (yours), respond to it. On the other hand, I am
happy to return student phone calls. So you win a few and lose a few.

Below is the reading list. If a pressing political issue emerges during the
term, we will try to incorporate it into the readings. You **must** read the
required texts. If you do not, the course will not be worthwhile and the
sections will be a pain. I make a promise to put all of my energy and thought
into my lectures, and I expect you to do the same with the course materials,
papers, and sections. If you don't, you should know that I am on intimate
terms with Tony Soprano ( _and_ his therapist). Unless there is a family or
medical emergency, missing more than two sections or three lectures will mean
you fail the class.

107\. After Evil: The Political Morality of Survivorship and Recovery

Instructor: R. Meister  
Office: Kresge 228, Phone 459-4563  
Office hours: Th 1:15 - 2:15  
E-mail: [meister@cats.ucsc.edu](mailto:meister@cats.ucsc.edu)

What does it mean to live in the aftermath of a morally unacceptable past? Is
peace among the survivors of evil inevitably (and merely) a compromise between
the grievances of former victims and the fear on the part former perpetrators
and their beneficiaries that reprisals will occur? Would a just peace require
the continuation of a morally legitimate struggle by other, less violent,
means until the ongoing effects of evil have been eradicated? Or is
reconciliation itself the morally appropriate response to an evil that has
been defeated?

The course will draw on a variety of sources to understand better the
metaphors of both war and peace as potentially appropriate attitudes toward
evils past and present. Building on this foundation, we will explore the moral
logic of the "human rights culture" that is the stated goal of liberal
transitions in post-traumatic regimes. Our focus will be on relations between
the continuing beneficiaries of past evil in such societies and those who
claim to speak for the victims. Does the achievement of consensus that past
was evil require an implicit agreement that evil is now past, and hence that
its beneficiaries may be allowed to keep their gains? What are the moral and
constitutional constraints placed on "nations in recovery" by the public
commitment to create an official version of a past that must be remembered so
that it will not be repeated? Is it possible to make a meaningful distinction
between paranoid and reparative forms of national recovery?

The prime historical examples we will consider are post-apartheid South
Africa, the post-slavery US, post-genocide Rwanda, and Post-Holocaust Germany,
Israel, and the US. In conjunction with particular issues we will also touch
upon post-authoritarian Latin America, post-Soviet Eastern Europe, and post-
militaristic Japan. Our overall approach, however, will be to use particular
national histories to explore the implicit moral logic of the promised
"Century of Never Again."

**Supplemental Readings and Resources:** Neil Kritz, ed., _Transitional
Justice,_ 3 vols., provides an essential compendium of documents and country
studies relevant to this course. Another useful resource is Naomi Roht-
Arriaza, _Impunity and Human Rights in International Law and Practice._ Rather
than assign these very costly books, I have included reference to the relevant
sections under the category of "Further Reading." The website for South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (www.truth.org.za/) has debates
and speeches by the major participants, full transcripts of important
hearings, all official documents of the Commission, submissions by the major
SA political parties, links to their websites, and links to major South
African newspapers. The best searchable version of the TRC Report is available
at [www.struth.org.za/](http://www.struth.org.za/), which is maintained by the
original webmaster of the TRC site.

For students interested in other issues the Internet has vast in the field of
human rights and transitional justice. The following websites are excellent
places to start your research: University of Minnesota Human Rights Library
([www1.umn.edu/humanrts/](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/)); Diana
([www.law.uc.edu/Diana/](http://www.law.uc.edu/Diana/)); UN Human Rights site
([www.un.org/rights/](http://www.un.org/rights/)); International Court of
Justice ([www.igc.org/cij/](http://www.igc.org/cij/)); European Court of Human
Rights ([www.dhcour.coe.fr/](http://www.igc.org/cij/)); Coalition for
International Justice ([www.icj-cij.org/](http://www.icj-cij.org/)); and AAAS
Science and Human Rights Program (<http://shr.aaas.org/dhr.htm>). The United
States Institute of Peace ([www.usip.org](http://www.usip.org)) sponsors
conferences and publications in this area. For a primer on human rights
research, see
([www.law.harvard.edu/programs/HRP/Publications/research.html](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/HRP/Publications/research.html)).

**Requirements:** Attendance at lectures and sections is mandatory. Two formal
papers will be required (in addition to informal presentations in section).
The first essay (c. 5pp.) will be on some topic related to the
_conceptualization_ of transitional justice. As a final paper, students will
be expected to critically analyze the means by which some particular nation
has dealt with the issues addressed in the course. If you wish to write on
some relevant topic or nation not covered in the syllabus, please consult me
or your TA for approval and references. (I have a large indexed database of
bibliographical materials, and may be able to save you considerable time as
you begin your research.)

140D. Comparative Post-Communist Politics

Instructor: Michael Urban  
(office hours: T.,Th. 2:15-3:45, 273 Stevenson  
email: [urban47@cats.ucsc.edu](mailto:urban47@cats.ucsc.edu)  
phone: 459-3153)

### Please note: This syllabus is from Fall 1998

_Scope and Objectives_. The subject matter of this course is bound up with the
phenomenon of transition; namely, the one currently under way among the states
of East Europe and the former Soviet Union whose futures seem sufficienfly
uncertain as to deprive us of any designation for them other than one that
simply negates their past-hence, the hollow term **`"`** post-communist". As
such, the first objective of the course is to build an understanding of that
past, what is, here, taken to be a unique socio-political formation known as
"state socialism". This objective can be broken down further into a number of
sub-topics that comprise the first part of the course: Marxist revolutionary
theory, Leninist revolutionary practice, Stalinist state construction and the
maturation and decay of state socialist systems. The problem of the political
role of intellectuals within the specific historical contexts peculiar to East
Europe and Russia is singled out for special attention in this regard.  
  
The second part of the course focuses on reforms within, and revolts against,
the state socialist order that have occurred in East Europe and the former
Soviet Union. On the basis of the analysis presented in the first part, it
locates a number of crisis tendencies specific to state socialist systems that
have led to movements for reform and revolution and examines how new
directions taken in one place and time often have reverberated later in the
politics of other states within the region. Moreover, the specific incidences
of mass resistance to state socialism modified it in one place or another,
lending different characters to state socialist regimes that would determine
the particular paths of transition that they would follow.  
  
Part three concerns the collapse of communism in East Europe and the former
USSR. The significance of that moment has only begun to be measured in
historical terms, yet its implications are already staggering enough: the
unhinging of the capitalist/communist dichotomy that has dominated politics,
nationally and globally, for the second half of this century, thus throwing
into question established identities, arrangements and alliances. The collapse
of one system and the formation of another allows us to glimpse the political
magma, usually obscured, assumed or unremarked in the study (and practice) of
"normal" politics. Therefore, we devote particular attention in this section
to social, cultural and economic issues, exploring the ways in which they have
shaped the politics of post- coiuinunist transitions.  
  
The final section examines a set of major political questions embedded in the
post-communist transition. Is this transition all of a piece or are there
**quite** distinct patterns evident among those societies that are undergoing
it? If the latter is true, how can differences be explained? Should post-
columunist transitions be regarded as a variant of a broader phenomenon, the
transition from authoritarian to democratic government, or are they
fundamentally different, thus constituting an entirely separate set of cases?
Do post-communist systems have a democratic future at all and, if so, on what
does it depend? Does the category "post- communist" represent a transitory
phenomenon or something that will occupy a new historical epoch? How have new
combinations of political and economic power been spun out of their state
socialist predecessors and how might they be characterized? Finally, if
communism has been liberal-capitalism's global competitor in this century, can
we expect an alternative competitive system to emerge in (some) post-communist
states, posing a new challenge to the liberal-capitalist world order?  
  
_Course Requirements_. In addition to meeting standard expectations-attending
lectures, completing all reading assignments prior to the respective class and
discussion sessions at which they are to be considered, sitting for two
examinations (a mid-term and a final) -each student is required to write two
papers. The first, due at mid-term, involves a short essay (3- 4 typed pages)
on a particular question chosen by the student from a list provided by the
instructor. The second, due at the last session of the course, is a
conventional term paper drawing on outside sources (expected length: about 10
pages) on a topic chosen by the student and approved by the instructor or
teaching assistant. For the second paper, all the usual rules of term-paper
writing apply (e.g., organization, proper citation form, adequate
bibliography).

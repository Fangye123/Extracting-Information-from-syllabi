**RECOMMENDED PREREQUISITES **  
    It is recommended that the student possess a basic understanding of general computer systems and their functions. Students will experience a higher sense of achievement if they have any of the following: Cartography or computer cartography; any algebra, analytic geometry or trigonometry; any introductory statistics course; and any computer related courses, especially operating systems, applications or programming.  
**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
    Societies in general are becoming keenly aware of the need to manage information from a geographic perspective. This awareness has been brought about by the twentieth-century trends toward a global community and economy. At the same time, the often negative impact of advancing technology has shown the need for wise management of the earth's resources. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the tools to help meet these challenges.  
    The course is divided between a lecture period and a laboratory period. The lecture portion of the course will be conducted partly in a seminar fashion, to achieve the research agenda of the course. Model proposals, group problem-solving, and presentations of models fill this portion. The major themes will consist of: GIS conceptual framework, the ArcInfo data model, and solving specific spatial problems with GIS.  
    The **laboratory** portion of the course is designed as a tutorial and will take the student step-by-step through a prepared, natural resource-based project and an individual model. The laboratory will make it possible for the student to complete the lecture portion of the course, and vice versa. The laboratory begins the **first week** of class. You must attend your registered lab unless other arrangements are made with the lab instructor.  
**COURSE OBJECTIVES**  
1\. The student will receive a somewhat applied overview of Geographic
Information Systems as related to ArcInfo (ESRI, Redlands, CA).  
2\. The student will learn to apply GIS to the input, manipulation, analysis,
and cartographic output of spatial data.  
3\. The student will understand how to conduct geographic research within a
GIS framework.  
4\. The student will gain a broad understanding of the GIS conceptual
framework, the ArcInfo data model, and solving specific spatial problems with
GIS.  
5\. In the laboratory portion of the course, the student will also learn
technical skills for working with the ArcInfo software.  
**TEXT AND MATERIALS  
** The required texts are:  
Clarke, Keith C. (2001). _Getting Started with Geographic Information Systems,
Prentice Hall, Upper Saddle River, NJ, 352 pp.  
_ Ormsby, Tim et al. (2001). _Getting to Know ArcGIS desktop. ESRI Press,
Redlands, CA._  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**  
1\. Assigned readings from texts and lecture.  
2\. Laboratory - ( **50%** **of total grade** ) _  500 pts  
Attendance_ \- **25%** \- lab attendance is mandatory. _  125 pts_  
_Flow Chart_ \- **25%** \- due 10th week. _  125 pts_  
_Final Model_ \- **50%** \- due beginning of 15th week. _  250 pts  
_3\. Lecture - ( **50%** **of total grade** ) _  500 pts  
Topic Presentation_ \- **60%** The Topic question, and answer, will be
presented in a professional, but entertaining, manner to the class on the
date. _  300 pts  
Quizzes _ \- **20%** Students will be quizzed periodically over material
presented in lecture. _  100 pts  
Participation _ \- **20%** Participation based on attendance. _  100 pts  
_**LOGIN  ACCOUNTS  
**    Each student will obtain a login account on the NT network, the first
week of class, if the instructor hadn't already secured one by the first class
period. Login accounts may be obtained from outside the administrator's
office, Rm 111 (next to the graduate computer lab). Be sure to fill in the
account information carefully and indicate that you want both a PC and Unix
account. Labs are held in the graduate computer lab.  
**POLICIES  
**     I will hold all exams and papers for one year. If your computed score
is one point below a grade threshold (e.g., 79%), you will receive the higher
grade if all assignments were completed in a timely and professional
manner.Final grades will not be posted nor will they be given over the phone.
Students who wish to know their final grade may bring a stamped self-addressed
envelope or postcard to the final class meeting which will be Wednesday of the
15th week (reading week). It will be mailed as soon as the final grade is
computed. If you miss a lecture or laboratory session due to illness, injury,
or family emergency, you must provide documentation to verify the legitimacy
of your absence. Make-up exams or laboratory exercises will be scheduled at my
or the lab instructor's discretion. Read [NAU's
policies](http://www.nau.edu/~stulife/safework.html).  
**NOTES  
   ** We will be completing on-line exercises that will help prepare you for
completing the final model. _ **  Please do not** **skip parts because they
seem unimportant, difficult to understand, or boring.**_ This will result in
you falling behind and you will receive less benefit from the course.  
    The FLAG24 dataset with which we will be working is new and has been minimally tested. There may be errors in the dataset, or errors anywhere in the on-line course page. I will give you 1 point extra credit for each error that you document in writing and e-mail to me. Be sure to put the term _GGR/FOR 525 Extra Credit_ in the subject heading.

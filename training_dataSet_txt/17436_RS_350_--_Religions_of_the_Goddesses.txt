RELIGIONS OF THE GODDESSES
        ____________________________

        Although there are goddess figures in traditions around the world, the 
        time limit of fifteen weeks demands choosing a particular focus. This 
        course will be an overview of the goddess traditions as they have been 
        explored in the archaeology and mythology of Western European and Near 
        Eastern development. As the course develops over the semester there will 
        be an intention to expand the field of study by requiring students to 
        do course projects specifically related to goddesses not covered in the 
        class.
We will begin with the examination of the goddess figures and symbols 
        as they appear in "Old Europe." The works of Marija Gimbutas, 
        Joseph Campbell and Riane Eisler will be the primary materials covered 
        in this section. Examination of the archaeological findings dating back 
        
        22,000 BCE will be the beginning point for the course. We will explore 
        the concept of "archeomythology" used by Gimbutas and discuss 
        the difficulties of interpretation of materials that have no written records. 
        In particular, time will be spent on the question of male and female roles 
        as reflected in cave art and goddess figures, as well as the question 
        of the existence of a "Great Goddess" as a religious figure 
        for Paleolithic and Neolithic peoples. Gimbutas states that the purpose 
        of her book The Language of the Goddess is to:
 explicitly identify the Old European patterns that cross the boundaries 
        of time and space. These systematic associations in the Near East, southeastern 
        Europe, the Mediterranean area, and in central, western, and northern 
        Europe indicate the extension of the same Goddess religion to all of these 
        regions as a cohesive and persistent ideological system.
In the mid-phase of the course we will cover archaeological sites on 
        the Minoan period, as well as sites along the banks of the Tigris and 
        Euphrates Rivers. Goddess traditions in Turkey, Crete, Sumer, Cannaan 
        and Mesopotamia will be examined. Written material will be explored, as 
        well as symbols and images. Relationships between these goddesses to earlier 
        information will be considered, as well as possible connections to Greek 
        tradition, Egyptian mythology and Hebrew scripture. To gain an understanding 
        of the complexities of goddess religions, we will cover goddess images 
        and myths from the cultures of both Egypt and Greece with a focus on comparisons 
        and contrasts between figures from a variety of traditions, and periods 
        in history. 
Finally, we will examine the development of Christian traditions and 
        their inclusive-exclusive perspectives involving goddess religions. The 
        figure of Mary and the topic of Maryology will be examined from both the 
        Roman and the Greek Orthodox positions. Christian overlay and incorporation 
        of images and traditions of Old Europe will complete the circle of goddess 
        exploration intended by this course.



WEB SITE PROJECT - http://humboldt.edu/~mlm5
        Name: mlm5
        Password: Tidbits
For the purposes of this course I have created a www page that provides 
        you the opportunity to explore goddess imagery as it relates to this class. 
        I have chosen images that correspond to the design of the course. As a 
        group project you are required to research one of the following questions 
        using the web site as a basic guide. Your group will then have a discussion 
        with another group in the class sharing with them what you have learned 
        on your topic. On the day of theses discussions each student must turn 
        in an outline of the topic covered to receive full credit for their group 
        project.

QUESTIONS 
1. What relationship, if any, can you find between the "Venus" 
        figures from the Paleolithic and Neolithic periods and the Venus of the 
        Greco-Roman period? What aspects of the goddess are represented in the 
        Venus imagery of these two periods in human history. 
2. After looking at images of the goddess from different periods in "Herstory" 
        speculate on how goddess images may influenced the interpretation of women 
        and women's roles. 
3 Trace the bull through the imagery of Cave Art, the shrines of Turkey 
        and Crete, as well as the symbolism of Egypt and Greece and reflect on 
        how the imagery reveals the human relationship to the animal powers. (You 
        may want to use Joseph Campbell's The Way of the Animal Powers in the 
        reference section of the library to understand this concept more fully.) 
        How was this animal, the bull, related to the goddess in various traditions 
        and what seems to have happened to that relationship?
4. Using question number three replace the examination of the bull with 
        the examination of the snake.
5. One of the topics addressed in the early part of this class was the 
        idea of "partnership societies." Through examination of the 
        art one can begin to explore this concept. Where do you see partnership 
        between the goddesses and gods? What are the functions of each? Which 
        periods of history speak of partnership and which speak of a struggle 
        for dominance between the feminine and masculine?
6. Focus on the tradition and Inanna/Istar and see how many things you 
        can relate to this goddess from what you have learned of other periods 
        in history, both before and after her. In other words How is Inanna like 
        goddesses from earlier periods how is she like goddesses from later periods.
Note: The number of images presented in this www site are a good overview 
        of goddesses as related to this course. This limitation to our area of 
        study makes the site somewhat narrow. Nonetheless, I believe that there 
        are enough images to indicate a direction for your class project relating 
        to one of the questions provided. Feel free to explore more fully the 
        topic that you are addressing through the examination of other materials 
        available in the library. You might want to look at the bibliography for 
        this course as a starting point. 
FINAL PAPER/GROUP PRESENTATION
As part of this course you must participate in a group project connected 
        to goddesses from other areas of the planet that are not covered in the 
        course lecturers. The class will be divided into approximately six to 
        eight groups. Possible areas of study will be Africa, China, Japan, The 
        Island Peoples, North American Indigenous People, South American Indigenous 
        People, Celtic and/or Norse traditions (parts of Europe that we will barely 
        touch.) It is expected that you will spend somewhere between 10 and 15 
        hours outside of class working with your group. Because of this expectation 
        you will be given three class sessions as "group project" time. 
        These classes are scheduled in weeks six, ten and twelve. Due to the importance 
        of these meetings attendance is required. Each group will keep a sign-in 
        sheet of those students present at each session. These sheets are to be 
        handed in at the following class meeting. Sign-in sheets will also be 
        require for the group discussion class in week seven and your final presentation 
        at the end of the semester. Each signature missed will cost you 20 points 
        from the 100 possible points listed for "group project." 

        You are also required to write a six to ten page research paper on a specific 
        goddess related to your group project. 
(1) You must choose one goddess from your group's area of study and write 
        a 6 to 10 page research paper on the history and mythology of this goddess. 
        Papers are to be typed, referenced and presented in a standard research 
        style. (200 points)
        Check http://www.webster.commnet.edu/mla.htm to be clear on your writing 
        style. Papers are required to meet the (MLA) Modern Language Association 
        Guidelines for Writing Research Papers.
        Note: If when accessing this web site there is not a side bar showing 
        "Table of Contents" follow the instructions for that material. 
        This is a very helpful site for how to reference your paper correctly.
        (2) As a group you are to find a creative way to present some of your 
        information to the rest of the class. You will have a half an hour of 
        class time during the last two weeks of classes for this presentation. 
        Please be as creative with this as you possibly can. Consider telling 
        stories, presenting goddesses foods, using puppets or masks as was of 
        informing the class concerning goddess traditions from other countries. 
        

        (3) It is important that you attend all four days of presentations during 
        the last two weeks of classes. Attendance only on the day you present 
        is not acceptable. Students work hard at creating these presentations 
        and they need classmates to receive what they have developed.

CEP705 ADVANCED STUDIES OF HUMAN GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT(3+0)3 credits.
Emphasis on implications of human growth and development for the curriculum.
Application and examples directed to the teaching profession.  
  
  
**_Overview:_ The content of this course addresses the four major goals of the
College of Education, so that students enrolled in CEP705 will:**  
  
1\. **Possess a love of learning** \- students enrolled in CEP705 will read,
evaluate, and analyze original works of various human development theorists.
These activities will provide students with increased self-awareness and a
greater sensitivity to both the commonalties and the differences that exist
among human beings. This increased knowledge, both about themselves and
others, will create in students a desire to read and learn even more about
human growth and development. This love of learning will carry over into their
personal and their professional lives.  
  
2. **Develop a strong fund of knowledge** \- students enrolled in CEP705 will learn about traditional theories of development and about current research findings in areas of cognitive, identity, personality, and career development. Students will demonstrate acquisition of knowledge through summary and analyses of reading assignments, through class discussions, and through performance on examinations. All class assignments will require students to engage in cognitive processes that require them to summarize, compare and contrast, analyze, and synthesize information. By engaging in these cognitive exercises, students will gain the ability to apply what they have learned in CEP705 in their personal and professional lives through use of their own intellectual abilities and problem-solving capabilities rather than through the use of faddish methodologies of limited usefulness.  
  
3. **Engage in reflective practice** \- students enrolled in CEP705 will gain insight about themselves personally and about other human beings with whom they coexist in their personal and professional lives. The intellectual exercises students will be required to perform throughout the semester will strengthen their cognitive capacities and provide them with intellectual resources from which they will be able to draw as they attempt to solve problems of human interactions in both their personal and professional lives. Students enrolled in CEP705 will not be taught specific educational, counseling, and supervisory methods that may work for some but not for all. Rather, course work is designed to enhance students' thinking processes to enable them to engage in reflective practices that will be most appropriately suited to each individual student or other human being under their charge. Reflective practice is the result of good thinking abilities not canned methodology.  
  
4. **Value democracy and multiculturalism** \- students enrolled in CEP705 will learn that the basic processes of human physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development are the same regardless of culture, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status. Thus, the emphasis in CEP705 is on the similarities of rather than on the differences between human beings. Students who understand that human beings are really much more like each other than they are different from one another will have gained the understanding to look beneath the facade and into the core of each human being with whom they interact. Then, once they understand the core nature of the individual, they will have gained the ability to work effectively with all individuals, regardless of their culture, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status.  
  
  
**_Course Objectives:_ As a result of active participation and successful
completion of course requirements, the student should be able to:**  
  
1\. Explain the relevance of theory to explain human development.  
2\. Describe the sequence of changes involved in human development.  
3\. Describe the physical, perceptual, and cognitive development of the
infant.  
4\. Describe the physical, perceptual, cognitive, social, and moral
development of the child.  
5\. Describe the physical, cognitive, social, and moral development of the
adolescent.  
6\. Describe the unique characteristics of adult development.  
7\. Describe the major theories of human development including those of
cognitive, moral, social, personality, and career development.  
  
  
**_Course Methodologies:_** Methodologies used in CEP705 will include lecture,
class discussion, and occasional small group activities (if appropriate).
Instructional media used in the class will include overhead projection and
occasional videos. Outside of class, students learn primarily by reading and
integrating their reading with written assignments.  
  
**_Student Expectations:_**  
  
"Students are expected to:

    1. Attend class and complete all assignments in accordance with the expectations established by their instructors and programs of study. 
    2. Conduct themselves in the classroom in a manner that contributes to a positive learning environment for all. 
    3. Familiarize themselves with all university policies and procedures. 
    4. Ask questions and seek clarification, direction and guidance to any class assignment, university policy or procedure which is unclear. Students may be expected to complete class requirements beyond the published meeting times. This varies by course and instructor." (University of Nevada, Reno 1999-2000 General Catalog, p. 8).  **_E-mail Policy:_** Remote students may turn in assignments via e-mail. However, make sure assignments are attached in a file rather than as part of the e-mail message. Assignments sent via e-mail must arrive before class time on the day they are due.  
  
Completed mid-term and final exams must be sent via regular mail.  
  
**_Student Performance Evaluation_**  
  
Each student will be expected to complete the following:

    1. Reading assignments 
    2. Examinations over class discussion and lecture 
    3. Piaget worksheets 
    4. Book analyses 
    5. Final project  
  

### ASSIGNMENT INSTRUCTIONS

  
***** TO PASS THE COURSE, YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL WORK ***  
  
ALL WRITTEN WORK MUST BE TYPEWRITTEN, FREE OF MECHANICAL AND GRAMMATICAL
ERRORS, AND TURNED IN ON TIME. POINTS WILL BE DEDUCTED FOR LATE PAPERS. FOR
REMOTE STUDENTS, PAPERS MUST BE RECEIVED ON OR BEFORE THE CLASS MEETING WHEN

* TEXTBOOK SUMMARIES** \- You will hand in a _**one page, typewritten**_ summary of each 2 chapters you read in the textbook (except for summary #10, which includes chapter 19) **(please either double space OR space between paragraphs and use 10- or 12-cpi typeface). _Points will be deducted for summaries that are NOT double spaced and longer than one page._**  
  
*** EXAMINATIONS** \- You will have 2 exams over class discussion and lecture
material. Each exam will be a take-home exam and consist of 50 objective
questions (multiple choice/true-false). You will need to purchase a scan-tron
sheet for each exam.  
  
*** PIAGET WORKSHEETS** \- For each reading assignment in the Wadsworth book,
you will be given a worksheet to complete. Each worksheet will consist of 5
questions or assignments (each question will be worth 10 points for a possible
total of 50 points per worksheet). Your answers to questions and completed
assignments will be a basis for class discussion.

worksheet, you may rework your incorrect responses and return for full credit.  
  
*** BOOK ANALYSES** \- Read the Maslow and Jung (i.e. Campbell) books, and an
additional book of your choice from the list I will provide you. For each
book, you will turn in a **_2-page, double-spaced abstract_** that includes a
brief summary of the contents ( **no more than 2-3 paragraphs** \- a longer
summary will result in reduced points), and a brief description of the
theorist's philosophy of development (i.e., what constitutes a "whole" human
being? what is a "healthy" human personality? How should life best be lived?
etc.)

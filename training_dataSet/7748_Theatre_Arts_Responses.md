    Quite a while ago, I asked the listserv to offer information regarding 
    Theatre/Performance Arts and Service-Learning. Thank you for all the wonderful 
    responses. I'm sorry it took so long to get this info back to you. The list is 
    quite long. Also, see the attachment for a great resource of ideas sent by 
    Laurel Hirt, who compiled  responses from a similar question she asked last 
    summer. Thanks, Sylvia King
    
    *Hello!  My name is Kim Barber.  I am the Chair of the Department of Theatre
    Arts at LaGrange College in LaGrange, GA.  I received your email regarding
    servant leadership for theatre from our Vice President of Student Life and
    Retention, Linda Buchanan, here at LC.
    
    For our Spring semester, as their Senior thesis project, four actors are
    putting together a Children's Theatre tour of folk and fairy tales that
    they will write, produce, perform and tour to local area elementary schools
    which are very desperate for "artful" activities to suppliment their
    curriculum.  The performers then meet the children after each performance
    and answer questions.  These students worked for me at my professional
    summer theatre in Lincoln, New Hampshire where we tour Children's Theatre
    throughout the state.  (papermilltheatre.org.)  One of the students wrote
    the scripts and most of the music last summer for these original musicals
    which bring these fairy/folk tales to life!
    
    We were fortunate to receive a Servant Leadership grant from LC so as to
    offer this service to the community free of charge.
    
    We are also entertaining the possibility in the near future of "Classical
    Scenes in the Schools" (similar to many professional outreach
    programs)where we would tour scenes from classics to teens and have a
    follow up Q and A on issues and impressions.
    
    I hope this helps,
    
    Sincerely,

    *Hello.  The SL program at CU just funded a proposal for a Music 
    Performance Class.  Students will be setting up and doing 
    performances for non-profits in the community.  They will be 
    practicing business skills along with performing.  Course will be 
    taught next semester and is actually labeled ad an internship. 
    Although the students will reflect on issues in weekly course 
    meetings.
    
    ChristinaOne author you might look at is Don Hellison.  The reflection 
    questions he poses in regard to physical education and sport can be translated 
    to dance and  other arts.
    Don does have a new book out (with 5 other authors).  I haven't see it yet - a 
    copy is on its way from Human Kinetics.

    *We have had a couple of theatre course integrate service-learning.  
    
    Mime and Movement
    The class partnered with members of On Stage! to create mime performances
    with a cirus theme. The On Stage! program conducts theater classes and
    provides performance opportunities to adults coping with mental illness. Our
    students taught their students about mime and developed over the course of
    the semester a joint performance that was put on on-campus at the end of the
    semester.
    
    Improvisational Acting
    Students conducted improv workshops at four different sites. One site was On
    Stage!. Another  site was with mentally disabled children. Another site was
    at a local elementary school with 3rd graders. And the last site was at an
    after-school program through the YMCA for middle school students. In groups
    the students conducted 3 workshops at each site. For the first half of the
    semester, they researched and studied ways to adapt improv to different
    populations.

    *try contacting folk at Columbia College, Chicago....they have extensive arts 
    programming with high levels of experiential learning..
    
    *John Wallace from the U of Minnesota forwarded your query to me.
    
    I use service-learning in my theater class, however, it is less 'traditional' 
    in its focus, and seems to lend itself more clearly to service-learning work. 
    I teach a version of Performance and Social Change and Community-based 
    theater to a class of 15 graduate and undergraduate students who spend 20-30 
    hours working with (somewhat vaguely defined) community-based theater groups. 
     These include a program using theater to teach literacy in elementary 
    schools, a theater company for highschool kids on the north side of 
    Minneapolis, a few interactive theater companies, and a Latina women's group 
    celebrating La Posada.  
    
    We spend a lot of time in the classroom asking questions about cultural 
    colonization, social agency, and the responsibility of the artist/community 
    to engage in mutual exchange. We also question the notion of 'community' as a 
    positive, homogenous entity, examining the boundaries of 'community,' their 
    fluidity/stability, and various ways of addressing the inclusion/exclusion 
    paradigm that often defines community. 
    
    The class is a combination of history/theory and practice. We look at the 
    pageantry movement of the early 20th century, Little Theaters, grassroots 
    theaters, separatist political movements identified with theater (such as the 
    Black Arts Movement, El Teatro Campesino), Cornerstone Theater, and 
    contemporary grassroots movements. I use Boal techniques, bring in guests 
    from Yugoslavia using the work of Grotowski and Barba, and introduce some 
    sociodrama to the classroom.
    
     I realize this model doesn't fit with how to use Service Learning in a voice 
    or playwrighting class, but if it is of interest, I can send you a syllabus. 
    Good luck!

    *I would recommend finding a previously "unvoiced" community (maybe poor,
    of color, etc) and working with them to tell their story.  See syllabus
    below and definitely contact the professor Billy Yalowitz,
    yalowitz@dca.net 
    
    An idea for a short assignment would be to create street theater
    performances that have been popular during the large protests we've seen
    recently (Seattle, DC, Prague, etc.)  I'm sure there's a much richer
    history to them then this past year, but recent events makes it more
    salient.
    
    Also, interesting disucssions could be on the use of art (especially
    movies, books, and other story telling devices) in creating social
    change.  Is this the purpose of art or not?  As Bertolt Brecht said,
    "Art is not a mirror held up to reality, but a hammer with which to
    shape it."
    
    Good luck!

    came up with the following information.  The first list is of programs - you 
    can contact the person for more information. Some of the programs are based in 
    high schools, but the themes and practices may be adaptable for college level. 
    And next is a list of publications and articles

    The basic idea of the service learning project was to offer community
    organizations our students' abilities to create audiovisual and/or
    printed materials which could be used by those organizations to promote
    their community work. Students from classes in public relations,
    audiovisual communication and persuasive communication worked with staff
    or volunteers at ten different community service organizations to
    produce brochures, flyers, web pages, PowerPoint presentations and
    videos to further the work of those organizations. The sustainability of
    the project depends on follow-through. Materials created this year will
    have a shelf life of one to three years. The partnerships would have to
    be continued in order to update he materials students created. Students
    learned the objectives and public communication strategies of the
    participating groups, and in some cases continued to work for the
    organizations after the class ended.

    The Piedmont High School service learning project is called "Very
    Special Arts." It utilizes the power of the arts to reach every child
    and adult with a disability through a cooperative effort involving high
    school art students and partners within the community. Students in the
    art curriculum receive disability training through guest speakers,
    videos, and class projects. Students in the National Art Honor Society
    work one on one with individuals with disabilities on field trips, and
    then report back to their classmates on their experiences. A countywide
    festival is planned round a children's story book author and each art
    activity is related to one of the author's books. On this day,
    participants have the opportunity to celebrate and share accomplishments
    in the arts. Many businesses and members of the community attend to make
    this day a true celebration.

    Beyond El Gran Capoquero (The Great Kapok Tree) Description
    "Beyond El Gran Capoquero" extends SAIL's 1997-98 interdisciplinary
    project whereby high school students acquire conversational Spanish
    skills via Drama while providing community service to K-2 Spanish
    students. That project's success, our desire to capitalize on the strong
    oral presentation/drama skills of SAIL students and the support of our
    school improvement plan (expansion of hands-on, applied experiential
    learning and a greater emphasis on community service for our students)
    encouraged us to continue. First semester included joint lesson
    planning, student training in Spanish, Drama, and Early Childhood
    Education teaching techniques, and development of student-produced
    curriculum implementation activities. SAIL students met with Ruediger
    second-grade students four times (informal "icebreakers", discussion of
    rainforest animals and habitats, and painting murals used as scenery for
    the first-grade students' second-semester performance). Second semester
    included SAIL students meeting ten times with the first-graders,
    teaching Spanish dialogue, drama and movement techniques, mask making,
    and performance preparation. There were four performances * one, early
    in the project, with SAIL students showing the Ruediger students "how
    it's done"; one, near the end, with all the students, for Ruediger
    parents and students; and two joint-cast productions, one for the
    "Celebrate the Arts Festival" at Gretchen Everhart School for
    Exceptional Students and one opportunity to entertain and exchange ideas
    with visitors from the Ecuadorian rainforest. Sail students provided
    approximately 700 hours of community service (including travel and
    preparation) and helped develop replicable curriculum materials. All
    students stayed enrolled in the program and took seriously their
    responsibilities as teachers and role models. There is positive
    anecdotal feedback from Everhart, Ruedigerand SAIL staff and plans to
    continue the Spanish/Drama curriculum and Ruediger/SAIL relationship. We
    may also pursue ways to replicate and use this Learn and Serve project
    as a model to implement the Sunshine State Standards for Foreign
    Language instruction for high school and elementary students and for
    using authentic assessment for evaluation.

    IN HARMONY is a project that has established a service learning program
    within our inner city school while establishing an intergenerational
    link between our 480 at risk students and 500 senior citizens at a
    nearby, non-profit, HUD subsidized retirement home. Our students are
    meeting actual community needs while extending student learning beyond
    the classroom. The students visit the retirement home each month to
    present interactive programs of newly acquired academic skills. IN
    HARMONY incorporates art, music, P.E., and drama to enhance what is
    taught in the academic curriculum. This program fosters the development
    of a sense of caring for others as the students share songs, games,
    stories, dances, art projects, and much more with the elderly and
    disabled residents form the senior citizen facility.

    Thanks to a group of enthusiastic team workers our community as a whole
    will be greatly enriched. Owing to a combined effort of our local Arts
    Guild, Construction students, who were responsible for designing and
    building a brand new performance-art interior for our local movie
    theater and a 6th Period Drama class, our community now has a top notch,
    state of the art theatre that the entire community and county can take
    pride in. The students profit greatly from the experience because it
    provides a setting (The Magnolia Theatre) that inspires them more so
    than a normal classroom environment. They are taught the history of the
    theater, all aspects of stagecraft (including lighting and sound), and
    lastly they are given the opportunity to improvise and perform. They
    spend a total of 180 hours in this "classroom". Not only do the students
    attend classes in the theater they are also custodians, who maintain and
    cleanup the facility for various performances. They operate the sound
    and lighting equipment and act as House Manager and staff for
    school-related performances. All the students find the experience to be
    greatly rewarding.

    "Play With A Purpose" participants conceptualized and produced three
    different shows that were shared with our community. These included a
    video, a radio drama, and a series of monologues and short scenes
    addressing teen issues important to them. Most of the participants were
    at risk. Students participating were involved in their first theatre
    experiences. It was inspiring to see these students get excited about
    both the production and the response of others to their efforts. The
    project was based at three sites including the Andy Griffith Playhouse,
    Foothills (alternative school) and the Eckerd Camp (a wilderness camp
    for youth offenders). Performances were held in housing authority
    recreation centers and in the Andy Griffith Playhouse. Students learned
    about the productions from conceptualization to final performances. They
    learned numerous skills relating to theater while focusing on issues
    that were relevant to them-these ranged from teen pregnancy and suicide
    to violence related topics.

    Students participate in weekly reflection classes at their site. The Empire 
    State Partnership (ESP) grant received by the three partners has enabled 
    artists to work with both groups of students and with faculty. Two of the FDLC 
    classes are preparing puppet shows with Brooklyn College based Puppetry in 
    Practice. They will perform at their local nursing home,
    the elementary school and at VTC nursing home sites. Similarly, VTC students 
    based at Hyam Salomon also will work with the puppeteers to prepare productions 
    which will be performed at the nursing home. The students will perform at their 
    schools and libraries also. Students from both schools are working as well with 
    poets, visual and performing artists to
    create productions based on their own writing, oral histories they collect form 
    family or community members, and picture books. Last year FDLC and VTC students 
    worked together with a performance artist to prepare a production of student 
    poetry which they then performed at a nursing home, a library and a park.

    TITLE: Towards Excellence: Developing High Standards in Youth Programs.
    AUTHOR: Diane Harrington
    YEAR: 1983
    PAGES: 24
    ABSTRACT: Examination of 4 programs in which young people have consistently 
    excelled shows common elements, despite differences in setting, population and 
    goals. The 4 programs, which exemplify problem solving, peer counseling, 
    community service and communication, respectively, include: (1) the Youth 
    Action Program in New York City, a community improvement
    program created and run by East Harlem youth with the help of adult 
    facilitators; (2) the Rap Room, located in a Hartsdale, New York, high school, 
    a drop in peer counseling center staffed by students trained by a school 
    psychologist; (3) the Family Life Theatre in New York City, in which, with the 
    help of adult mentors, high school students develop and
    present short skits on health related issues for other young people and 
    community groups; and (4) Youth Communication/Chicago Center in Chicago, 
    Illinois, in which teenagers, with the help of adult facilitators, work to 
    promote positive ideas about the role of adolescents in society. Elements 
    common to all, and which seem to be requisites for excellence,
    are meaningful and challenging work, a collaborative group that allows for both 
    structure and flexibility and provides responsible roles for youth, 
    facilitating roles for adults that permit careful preparation and training of 
    youth, opportunities for reflection and rewards for excellence (ERIC).

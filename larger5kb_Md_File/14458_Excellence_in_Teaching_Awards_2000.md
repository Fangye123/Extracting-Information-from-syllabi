The Columbia College Excellence in Teaching Award rewards teaching that
inspires student interest and creativity, facilitates mastery of the material,
and encourages knowledge of self.



![](../../../images/awards.jpg)For 1999-2000, the emphasis of the award was on
**teaching that challenges and encourages students to discover and learn about
themselves**. In the language of Columbia's statement of purpose, we wanted to
recognize and celebrate teaching strategies that "help students find out who
they are and to discover their own voices, respect their own individuality,
and improve their self-esteem and self-confidence." Recipients of the
Excellence in Teaching Award received $2000, an engraved plaque, and were
recognized at Commencement on 4 June 2000, and again at New Faculty
Orientation in September. In honoring them, we celebrate the qualities we
value throughout our teaching and learning community.



**Nominated faculty submitted the following materials to the Teaching and
Learning Committee for consideration:**

> 1) An essay (approximately two pages; word-processed and single-spaced)
explaining a specific pedagogical strategy that challenges and encourages
students to discover and learn about themselves. Nominees were asked to
describe their teaching strategy, its use in their classroom (when, how, and
why), and its learning outcomes. They were encouraged to be explicit and
concrete about how their approach helps them accomplish their teaching
objectives by generating critical or creative thinking and/or a deepened
enthusiasm for the processes of learning.

> 2) A syllabus for the course in which the instructor used the teaching
strategy described in his or her essay.

> 3) Supporting materials (for example, hand-outs, slides, videos, address of
a class web site);

Letters of recommendation from colleagues and students were solicited by the
Teaching and Learning Committee.



Recipients of the Excellence in Teaching Awards 2000

**Full-time Faculty**

**Sara Livingston (Television, Senior Seminar)**

Sara sees her primary role in the classroom as "a remover of obstacles and an
opener of doors." Whether teaching "Writing for Television," "Television and
Society," Individual Visions," or "Senior Seminar," Sara believes that "when a
student's life story and experiences are listened to and valued, fear goes
away and voice can emerge." In her essay, Sara articulates innovative ways she
has "integrated some of the techniques for fostering community and evoking
voice" practiced in Senior Seminar in her Television courses, observing that
"the changes in the atmosphere of [her] classroom and in the quality of
[student] work have been nothing short of miraculous."

**Shyla McGill (Science and Mathematics)**

Shyla clearly loves the challenge of demystifying math and of building her
students' confidence that that their ideas are good and their problem-solving
skills deserve to be respected. While teaching at Columbia, Shyla has written
a new textbook, Basic Math Skills, for our students, a text designed to get
students participating actively in learning mathematics. In the words of one
of Shyla's colleagues in the Science and Mathematics Department, she merits
this award because of "her empowerment of students to incorporate an awareness
and appreciation for mathematics into their personal 'voice';" because of her
innovative methods, her passion for teaching . . . and because of her ability
to help students become enthusiastic, lifelong learners."

**Honorable Mention**

**Rose Economou (Journalism, Freshman Seminar, Senior Seminar)**

Rose's eloquent essay presents her approach to teaching a Topics in Journalism
course on "Covering the International Story;" she describes a teaching
strategy that challenges students to explore the world around them to better
understand their world within.



**Part-Time Faculty**

**Jeff Abell (Interdisciplinary Arts)**

Jeff has been teaching a course on Sound Images in the Interdisciplinary Arts
Department at Columbia for 19 years. Students begin their work in this
course-a unique combination of cultural studies, music theory, and hands-on
composition--by composing an autobiography in sound; that is, students
reconstruct a defining moment in their lives as they remember it through
sound. In Jeff's "History of Interdisciplinary Arts" course, students immerse
themselves in the intimate details of the lives of artists, thereby learning
about themselves and each other. One admiring student writes: "If any
instructor can make a difference in the way we view the world, it is Jeff
Abell."

**Joan Dickinson (Interdisciplinary Arts)**

Joan considers it her responsibility as a teacher to be "an informed, focused,
and compassionate presence." She finds joy in "helping [students] understand
their own value, find their voice or multiplicity of voices, learn to mediate
and filter the world, thereby enlarging their understanding and allowing more
of the world to affect them." The Chair of Interdisciplinary Arts, Suzanne
Cohan-Lange, appreciates Joan's "quiet, patient demand for excellence" and her
"knack for drawing out focus, commitment, and intensity from students."

**Honorable Mention**

**Julie Caffey (Senior Seminar)**

Julie brings her experiences in improvisation and her openness to wonder and
messiness to her teaching of Senior Seminar. Bill Hayashi, Director of the
Senior Seminar Program, observes that it is Julie's "passion, her
authenticity, and her dedication to her art and teaching that make her such a
powerful inspiration and model for her students." Another colleague notes that
Julie "inspires [students], picks them up, and makes them feel that they can
do anything."

**Honorable Mention**

**Drew Ferguson (Fiction Writing)**

If you take a writing class from Drew Ferguson, he promises that he'll "be
listening to everything you say in and out of class," promises that he'll
spend the semester trying to figure out where you're coming from each and
every moment and evaluating what [he] can do to push you there." According to
his former teacher and current Chair in Fiction Writing, Randy Albers, "Drew
lives and breathes the Columbia mission." According to one former student, "My
fourth grade teacher was the reason I wanted to study creative writing; Drew
is the reason I continue to do it."

**Honorable Mention**

**Laurie Lawlor (Fiction Writing)**

For Laurie, "Childhood is a place that ultimately surprises [students],
connecting and transcending their differences and making them think deeply
about who they were, who they are, and who they might be capable of becoming."
A colleague and former student writes: "In [Laurie's] classrooms, people
indeed feel encouraged to be their individual selves, knowing that they are
being listened to with attention and respect-yet mere confession is not
encouraged, no amateur psychotherapy practiced. Always Laurie directs our
attention, our sense of self and voice and personal history, toward the
writing, toward the telling of well-crafted stories."

**Honorable Mention**

**Litjen (LJ) Tan (Science Institute)**

LJ provides his students with the most up-to-date scientific knowledge by
incorporating into his classes the latest information that he obtains through
his full-time job as Infectious Disease Specialist at the American Medical
Association. LJ believes his Columbia students "benefit from being at the
cutting edge of the frontiers of science and discover for themselves the
remarkable influence current scientific findings are having or will have in
their current and future lives." Zafra Lerman, Head of the Institute for
Science Education marvels that LJ "can take the most complex concepts and
translate them so every single student can understand."

Syllabus: **_ECONOMICS 114--SEMINAR IN AMERICAN ECONOMIC HISTORY_** Meetings:
Wednesdays, 2 - 5 p.m., 45 Evans

Department of Economics  
University of California  
Spring 1999  
Professor Martha Olney

Economics 114 is an undergraduate seminar in topics in U.S. economic history.
This semester we will look at the common wisdom about various aspects of
economic history that we gain from popular films and assess the accuracy or
inaccuracy of that "wisdom" gained from film. In addition, term papers will be
required for this course. Economics 114 is especially recommended for junior
economics majors who anticipate writing a senior thesis. The term papers
written in undergraduate seminars can become the basis for a senior honor's
thesis.

    
**_Adding the Course_**

 Enrollment is limited to 25 students. You must have passed Economics 113 in a
previous semester in order to take this course. Priority is given to economics
majors. **No admissions after February 2.**

 Admission is through instructor approval. To petition for admission, submit
the following to Professor Olney  
(1) a copy of your transcript, and  
(2) a one-page paper explaining why you want to take Economics 114.

You can place the information in Professor Olney's mailbox in 611 Evans or
e-mail it to MOlney@econ.berkeley.edu. **Decisions on admission will be made
by Friday, January 22.** Admissions lists will be posted at 691 Evans and
508-2 Evans. Course entry codes will be e-mailed to students who are admitted
to the seminar. _Check your e-mail!_

>   _I am also teaching Econ 1 this semester so my office hours might be
crowded. Good times for Econ 114 students to catch me: walk back to my office
with me after class._

_  **Prerequisite**_  
 Economics 113 is a prerequisite for this course. This prerequisite will be
enforced.

**_Required Textbook and Reader_**  
 There is no textbook or reader for the course.

**_Goals for This Seminar and Strategy_**

 I have three primary goals for this course. First, I want you to further
develop your critical thinking and viewing skills. Second, I want you to
develop research skills. And third, I want you to acquire an appreciation for
the extent to which we often learn our history from the movies.

To accomplish these goals, we will have three three-week film modules in which
we will watch a film, form research questions based on the film's assertions,
research those questions in groups, and report the research results. In
addition, your critical thinking and research skills will be developed through
the writing of a research term paper, discussed in detail below.

**_Responsibilities and Requirements_**

 My responsibilities are to come to class prepared, encourage appropriate
class participation, promptly grade and return papers, be available during
scheduled office hours and as possible for scheduled appointments, and
stimulate an enthusiasm for economics, for history, and for learning.

 Your responsibilities are to attend and participate in the seminar three
hours per week, attentively watch the film during class time (or, if you are
unable to attend, in the Media Center of Moffitt Library within days of the
class viewing), participate in the research design, complete all assignments
on time, and write and present a term paper.

**_Special Accommodations_**

 If you require special accommodations due to learning or other disability,
speak with Professor Olney **no later than February 3.** You will need an
evaluation form from Disabled Students' Program (230 C esar Chavez Center).  


**_Letter of Introduction_**

 For our second meeting, please write a one-page letter of introduction of
yourself to Professor Olney. Include your name and anything about yourself
that you would like to share. This may be typed or handwritten. It may be
brought to class on January 27 or sent by e-mail to MOlney@econ.berkeley.edu.
It will not be graded nor returned.

    
**_Film Modules_**

 There will be three 3-week film modules. Each module counts for 15 percent of
your course grade. _During week 1's meeting_ , we will watch a film that
either directly or indirectly offers lessons about some aspect of U.S.
economic history. We will watch with pen in hand, with an eye toward picking
out what the film maker has stated about the economy. _During week 2's
meeting_ , we will discuss what economic history we saw in the film, develop
research questions based on the assertions in the film, form groups of up to
four people, plan and begin our research. _During week 3's meeting_ , your
group will discuss and turn in a 4 to 7 page paper reporting on the research
your group has conducted. At week 3's meeting, you will also turn in an
individual confidential evaluation of yourself and your team members. In the
evaluation, give each member of your team including yourself an individual
score out of 10 possible points for participation and contribution to the
group's paper. Include a few comments accounting for the number of points
awarded. Your class participation and team evaluation component of your grade
(worth 10 percent) will be based in part on your teammates' evaluations of
your contribution to the group paper.  


**_Term Paper_**

 An important requirement for this course is a term paper. You should choose a
topic in U.S. economic history. It need not be suggested by the films we
watch, but it should be about some aspect of U.S. economic _history_. All
topics must be approved by Professor Olney. Most students try to choose a
topic that is too broad (for example, "Slavery in the U.S."). It is simply
impossible to write anything interesting on such a broad topic. For most
people, the challenge is narrowing the topic down. For example, "Evidence of
Nutritional Attainment in African Slaves in the American South" is a topic
that is probably narrow enough to allow the writing of an interesting and
worthwhile paper.

 If you do not have an initial topic of interest, I suggest two strategies.
First, thumb through your Economics 113 textbook and make a list of the topics
that particularly interested you. One of those topics might provide the basis
for a term paper topic. Second, go to the library and thumb through old issues
of _Journal of Economic History_ , _Journal of Interdisciplinary History_ ,
_Social Science History_ , or _Journal of Social History_. Keep a list of the
papers that particularly interested you. If neither of these strategies turns
up a topic that is of interest to you, then you really should not be taking
this seminar.

 You will need to manage your time well in order to complete the requirements
for this seminar. To help you along, there are several preliminary deadlines
and one final deadline connected with the term paper.

**Topic Idea Due Wednesday, February 10**  
 This should be a topic you have narrowed down at least somewhat. Professor
Olney will give you feedback on your topic idea.

  **Discuss Topic** **Wednesday, February 24**  
 On this date, you will discuss your term paper topic with others in the
seminar in groups.

**Bibliography Due Wednesday, March 10**  
 This should be an annotated bibliography of at least seven items. At least
one item must be a primary source, not a secondary one. "Annotated" means that
you need to write one or two sentences about each item in the bibliography,
summarizing what is in the item and how it will be useful to your research.

**First Draft Due Wednesday, April 7**  
This can have some holes in it, but not many. There should be at least 8
usable pages of text in your first draft. The first draft should reflect a
carefully thought-out outline of the paper. It may not have all the empirical
work completed; there may be some literature you have not yet consulted; it
will still need some work. But it should be possible from this first draft to
have a clear idea of where you are headed with your final draft.

**Presentation Wednesdays, April 21, April 28, and May 5**  
 You will have 10 minutes to present the main findings of your term paper to
the class. When you prepare your presentation, keep in mind that a good
presentation should clearly and concisely tell your audience (1) what your
topic is, (2) why it is an interesting topic, (3) what others had written
previously on this topic, and (4) what you have found. You should spend half
of your time on the first three points and half your time on the last point.
10 percent of your course grade will depend upon your term paper presentation.

**Final Draft Due Friday, April 30, 5:00 p.m.**  
 15 to 20 pages. Double-spaced. One-inch margins on all sides. Pages numbered.
Reasonable font size. Tables imbedded in text. Something you are proud of.
Late papers lose grade per 24-hour day or part thereof. For example, papers
received Monday morning, May 3 will lose one full grade (a B paper receives
only a C; an A- paper receives only a B-). Papers received before 5 p.m. on
Wednesday, May 5 will lose 5/3 of grade (a B paper receives a D+).

**_Course Grades_**

 Your course grade will depend upon your performance on the following, with
weights as indicated:  
  Class participation and team evaluations  | 10 %  
---|---  
Group Paper due February 17  | 15 %  
Group Paper due March 17  | 15 %  
Group Paper due March 14 | 15 %  
 Presentation of term paper |  10 %  
Term paper  | 35 %  
 Students taking the course under the P/NP option must earn a grade of C- in
order to pass the course.

**_Academic Honesty Policy_**

 In fairness to students who put in an honest effort, cheaters will be treated
harshly. Any evidence of cheating will result in a score of zero (0) on that
assignment or paper. Cheating on the term paper will result in a failing grade
(F) for the course. Incidences of cheating will be reported to the Office of
Student Conduct, which may administer additional punishment. Cheating includes
plagiarism. Plagiarism includes appropriation of whole passages with or
without credit, appropriation of words and phrases without credit,
appropriation of both main and supporting ideas without credit, and
paraphrasing without credit. Plagiarism also includes submitting a paper
written by someone else. If you are unsure of how to properly cite sources, be
sure to ask Professor Olney for guidance.

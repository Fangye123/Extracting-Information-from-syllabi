**1. _Objective:_** This is an introductory course in physical volcanology
offered at the graduate level (although advanced undergraduates may enroll
with instructor permission). The main topics covered are the physical
properties of lavas, the geomorphology of volcanic landforms, the dynamics and
monitoring of volcanic eruptions, and the emplacement of volcanic deposits.
Other topics will include planetary volcanism, volcanic hazards assessment,
remote sensing of volcanoes, and the effects of eruptions on the climate.

  

**2. _Required Text:_** Volcanology: A Planetary Perspective by Peter Francis
_(Oxford University Press, 1993, ISBN: 0-19-854033-7)._

  

**3. _Lecture Times:_** Tu, Th from 2:30pm - 3:50pm in Thaw 205. Attendance is
required at all scheduled class meetings. In addition, because of my travel
schedule this semester and subsequent cancelled classes, there will be several
supplementary class meetings scheduled on Saturdays. Please see the schedule
for those times.

  

**4. _Course Requirements:_**

  * Exams: There will be one mid-term and one final examination. The exams are not comprehensive and may include short answer, essay questions and quantitative problem solving. Questions will be based on material covered in the lectures and any additional assigned material. 

  * Project: The term project will be your chance to perform a research study on a current volcano assigned by me. The purpose of this four-part project _(three for the undergrads)_ is to better understand how a volcano works and how volcanologists conduct their science. It will constitute 50% of your final grade and therefore should be given a serious effort. Over the course of the semester, each student will complete a series of parts that are detailed below. I will grade each of these and provide feedback. The final project (including the oral presentation and revised earlier sections) will be turned in to me **in a completely digital format on December 12th.**

**

    1. Geologic History:** Upon beginning any geologic study of a new area (volcanic or otherwise), the first priority is to perform a complete literature search and develop a geologic history. For volcanologists, this also entails the eruptive history and hazard potential. This section should be no longer than 5 typed pages _(10-12 point font, double spaced, exclusive of figures)._ It should include a brief description of your volcano, summary of all human observations, any quantitative data available, range of compositions, eruptive products, and the current state of activity/monitoring. This should serve as complete summary of your literature search (you will use this information for all subsequent sections!!). **Part #1 is due on September 27th.**

**

    2. Hazard Assessment:** The second part of the project is a thorough hazard assessment of your volcano. You should look at the eruptive history and impact on the local/regional/global environment as well as the present-day topography in order to evaluate the future hazards. You should be able to estimate the eruptive style, volume and products based on your geologic history and make predictions for several different "what-if" scenarios. There is no set format for this part because each volcano is different. Use your imagination and present your assessment in the most clear, concise manner possible. This section should not exceed the length requirements of part #1, but should include maps and figures of hazard prone areas. **Part #2 is due on October 25th.**

**

    3. Research Proposal _(graduate students only):_** The third part of the project is designed to get graduate students thinking about how to propose and perform research. As you work your way through the first two parts, you should take note of what research has been (and is currently being) done. There will be areas that are not well understood and are potential targets of future research. This three-page proposal should be original in nature (don't duplicate something already done!!) and contain the following elements: the question to be addressed, the plan of action, the expected results, and the linkage to current work. Unlike "real" research proposals, you have an unlimited budget -- so be creative! You will be judged on: the originality of the proposed research, the feasibility of it, and whether your research plan is sound and will truly address the question proposed. **Part #3 is due on November 27th.**

**

    4. Oral Presentation:** The final part of the semester project is an oral presentation of your results. Those of you who have had classes with me in the past know that all oral presentations must be made in Power Point _(or a non-Microsoft product of your choice)_. I require oral presentations in general, and Power Point specifically, in order to (a) prepare you for future talks at national conferences and (b) to get you up to speed on current technology. It is far easier to hone those public speaking skills in a classroom filled with friends than in a conference room filled with over a hundred scientists! Presentations will be 15 minutes in length with 5 minutes of Q &A; and be conducted during the next to the last week of class **(November 27th & 29th).** 

  

**5. _Grading:_** Grading will be based on class participation, the exams, and
the final project. There will be no extra credit and no make-ups!! The exact
grade breakdown will be:

  * Class participation| .............. | 10%  
---|---|---  
  * Mid-term examination| .............. | 20%  
  * Final examination| .............. | 20%  
  * Final project _(oral)_| .............. |  20%  
  * Final project _(written)_| .............. |  30%  

  

**6. _Web Site:_** The site is located at
**<http://ivis.eps.pitt.edu/courses/volcanology/>** and will contain the
syllabus, announcements and assignments for the class. I tend to continually
revise the class schedule as the semester progresses, so please check there
for the most current class information.

  

**7. _Cheating:_** This is not even worth bringing up in a graduate course.
All students are expected to abide by the Academic Integrity Policy. If you
are caught cheating during a test or on your projects you will receive no
credit for that exam/project. No excuses.

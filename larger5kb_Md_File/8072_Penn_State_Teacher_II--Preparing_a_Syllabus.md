## Appendix B: Preparing a Syllabus

The value and utility of a good syllabus should not be underestimated. The
time you spend planning the course and writing a syllabus will have far-
reaching and time-saving benefits throughout the semester. In chapter 1 we
discussed some of the general principles involved in planning a course. This
appendix provides additional practical guidance in writing a syllabus, as well
as some useful examples. The first item is a checklist for reviewing syllabi
that was prepared by participants in the Course in College Teaching. You and a
colleague might use the checklist to review each other's syllabi, or you can
use it by yourself to reflect on your own syllabus. The list is intended to be
comprehensive, but not prescriptive. Some items, such as home phone, are
clearly optional. Others, such as lab safety, are relevant only in certain
courses. The University Faculty Senate does require that students be provided
the following information during the first ten days of class: the examination
procedures and grading policy, the academic integrity policy, and the evening
exam schedule for daytime courses. Beyond these basic requirements, the merit
of any item depends on what information the instructor wants to communicate to
the students at the beginning of the semester.

This checklist covers most of the basics, but many Penn State teachers have
explored additional options and possibilities. For example, Harold Schobert
(Materials Science) includes a list of "commonly asked questions about this
course," which answers questions such as "How much math do I need for this
course?" and "What are the exams like?" Likewise, [Kelly
Madole](http://cac.psu.edu/~klm10/213s97syllabus.html) (Psychology) provides a
page of "advice for successful performance" in the course as part of her
syllabus (see below).

Many faculty and TAs now also post their syllabi on the World Wide Web. Not
only does this provide easy access for students, but it also allows them to
create a syllabus that includes more than a paper syllabus can. For example,
[John Harwood](http://www.personal.psu.edu/jth/Engl497.html) (English) links
from his syllabus to style manuals, assignment sheets, and student projects.
[Anthony Verstraete](http://www.smeal.psu.edu/misweb/204info.html)'s
(Management Information Systems) on-line syllabus provides links to University
policies, on-line study pages for each exam, and exam keys and answer
explanations. Other syllabi allow students to write e-mail to the instructor
and link to other useful resources on the World Wide Web. In addition, a Web-
based syllabus can be updated more easily and frequently than a paper one, and
many teachers add links to homework solutions, exam keys, and student samples
as the semester progresses. A syllabus posted on the Web also reaches beyond
Penn State, allowing users all over the world to access the objectives,
assignments, and other materials for the course. For example, [Douglas
Arnold](http://www.math.psu.edu/dna/graphics.html)'s (Mathematics) calculus
page has been accessed over 55,000 times and has won national recognition.

If you are writing a syllabus for the first time or revising a syllabus you
have used previously, you will find it helpful to see what others have done.
You can find many examples on-line by browsing the Penn State Web site, and
many departments keep copies of old syllabi on file. In addition, we've
included the following [examples](syllabi.html) offered by Penn State
teachers. Remember, though, that each syllabus is a unique and individual
document. These models may provide some ideas, but ultimately your own
syllabus will reflect who you are as a teacher.

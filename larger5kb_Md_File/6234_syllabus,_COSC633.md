**Prerequisite** : COSC 433 (Operating Systems) and either COSC 330 (Discrete
Math) or Math 546.

**Textbook** : Silberschatz, Galvin & Gagne, _Applied_ _Operating System
Concepts_ , Addison-Wesley, 2000.  
    Recommended: Linden, _Just Java 2_ (5th edition), Prentice Hall, 2001. 

**Course Summary:** Students successfully completing the course will have
learned the major components, requirements and capabilities of operating
systems, and be proficient in the use of multi-threaded systems.  


* The course is project oriented, with Java programming assignments spread throughout the semester.

###  Course Calendar:

Due dates for projects are _underlined_ . Exam dates are in **bold**. Be aware
that due dates sometimes slip.   You are responsible for monitoring the course
webcaucus for the latest deadlines.  In addition, programming assignments
(particularly the later ones) may be altered to accomodate the interests of
the class as the semester progresses.

###  Grading Policy:

The final course grade will be a weighted average of the grades received in
each of the following categories, as specified: Small projects & homeworks 5%,
_Programs_ 45%, _Midterm exam_ 20%, _Final exam_ 30%..  


**Tardiness Policy:** Programming and other homework assignments will be due
_at the beginning_ of class. After that, assignments will be accepted through
the start of the next scheduled class, but will suffer a full grade penalty.
E.g., if a late programming assignment is worthy of an 'A', I will mark it a
'B'. Assignments more than one class late will not be accepted, and will
receive a grade of 'F'.

**Attendance Policy:** We're all grown-ups, when and whether you attend class
is up to you. However, missed assignments, and exams shall only be excused by
a doctor's written note, verifying that the student was medically indisposed
to attend class that day. The first missed quiz (for any reason) will be
treated as the "lowest graded quiz", and therefore dropped from the averaging
calculation. Any additional missed quizzes must be excused by a doctor's note.

**Grading of Programs:** Grading of programming assignments will reflect three
factors, weighted as shown.

  1. (70%) Correctness -- does the program run correctly.
  2. (15%) Style -- does the code adhere to class documentation standards? Is the code indented properly? Are the variable names mneumonic? How well has the student followed the basic formatting characteristics for the language?
  3. (15%) Design -- is the program adequately decomposed (i.e., are the functions and procedures small enough to be comprehensible)? Are the class and structure definitions well chosen? How well has the student taken advantage of the language's capabilities?

###  Announcements and the Web Page:

Students should view the course web page regularly for announcements regarding
programming assignments, readings, etc. I update course web pages frequently!

###  Cheating policy:

Students are required to attend to the policy on academic irregularity
outlined in the EMU student handbook. In addition, collaboration among
students in solving programming and homework assignments is forbidden. If I
receive programs or homework assignments that are substantially equivalent, or
which are not the original work of the student submitting the material, I will
not hesitate to punish all involved parties to the fullest extent, up to and
including assignment of a failing grade for the course, and referral to the
Office of Judicial Student Services for possible punitive action at the
University level, which may include expulsion from the University. In
addition, the University and the computer science department maintain policies
regarding proper behavior on its computer systems. Failure to adhere to these
policies can result in loss of computer privileges, and possible legal action.

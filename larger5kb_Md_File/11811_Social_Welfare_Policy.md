**Course Description**

This course provides historical background on the development of American
social work and social welfare policy and familiarizes students with library
and internet sources of policy material. By subsequent examination of several
contemporary social problems and policy areas, the course acquaints students
with the contours of current polices and provides an opportunity to examine
critically the underlying assumptions of social policy and the political
nature of policy choices.

**Course Objectives**

This course is part of the foundation training of all MSS students and has the
following objectives:

1\. To provide an overview of the history of social welfare policy in the
United States.  
2\. To examine the historical development and present status of social work as
a profession.  
3\. To acquaint students with key elements of social welfare policy analysis.  
4\. To consider the importance of various social divisions in the development
of social welfare policy.  
5\. To encourage students to think critically about the policy dimensions of
their professional practice.  
6\. To familiarize students with library and internet sources of policy
material.

**COURSEGUIDELINES:**

1\. This is a seminar. You are expected to attend all classes and film
viewings, to read thoroughly, to maintain the reading schedule, and to
contribute significantly by thoughtful discussion. Undocumented absences
beyond two will lower your grade (excused only if documentation from a dean or
medical doctor is provided).

2\. Seminar sessions should be more student-initiated than in traditional
classes. You are expected to contribute by occasionally finding some outside
material to add to informal discussions. (Of course this research material may
also be added to your papers.)

3\. Papers must be computer printed (laser or inkjet quality), following MLA
format.

4\. For each week-day a paper or presentation is late, your grade for that
assignment will fall by approximately one letter.

5\. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. If you submit any work which is not the
product of your own study and efforts, you will receive a grade of F for that
work and perhaps for the course.

6\. You are encouraged to visit the professor during office hours or by
appointment for assistance with research, papers, presentations, etc., or to
discuss the course material.

* * *

**BASIS FOR GRADES:**

*Discussion Contribution to Seminar (thoughtful discussion  & regular attendance): Expected  
Papers #1, #2, #3: 15% each  
Paper #4: 25%  
Presentation: 25%  
Outside Research Contribution to Seminar: 5%

*A deficiency in this area will lower the grade you earn in the other four areas.

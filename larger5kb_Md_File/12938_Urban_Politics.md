**Political Science 432:**  
**    Urban Politics** | **Dr. Triebwasser**  
**Fall 2001**  
---|---  
  
###  COURSE OUTLINE

  
This course will examine urban governance in the context of both electoral and
issue-oriented politics. It will focus on such topics as the relationship of
municipal governments to the state and federal governments; the relationship
between government and business; the relationship between the city and its
suburbs; and ethnic, professional, and bureaucratic politics.

Judd and Swanstrom's _City Politics_ describes the general context in which
urban politics developed and now operate. Robert Dahl's study of New Haven in
_Who Governs?_ presents a basis for the discussion of pluralist theory as it
relates to urban and national politics. Edward Banfield's _The Unheavenly City
Revisited_ offers a "conservative" view of city life. And Fred Siegel's
_Annual Editions: Urban Society_ contains a number of recent magazine and
journal articles.

In addition to the required books, each student will be expected to do a
**term paper** on the economic development plans of a municipality within
Connecticut, especially as it affects small business.  As an alternative to
this assignment, some students will be allowed to do more theoretical term
papers using some of the books appearing on the attached Book List as a
starting point. The papers--whether based on a town's economic development
plans or on a choice of books--will be presented as typewritten reports **from
ten to fifteen pages in length.** Some students may also be asked to make an
oral presentation based on the work they will be doing for their term paper.

Along with the term paper and possible class oral presentation, students'
performances in the course will be judged on the basis of **two examinations**
and on **class participation.** It is expected that students will keep up with
the required reading, whether or not a specific reading assignment is
announced in class. Should class participation become particularly lax,
**unannounced quizzes** may be given.

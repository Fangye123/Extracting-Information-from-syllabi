**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
What is a good argument?  How do arguments work?  What makes some arguments
better than others?  The purpose of this course is to equip students to
recognize and analyze argumentation as it occurs in a variety of contexts such
as editorials, discussions, speeches, argumentative essays, and philosophical
texts.  To accomplish this, we will study the components of good arguments,
different types of arguments, common ways in which arguments can go wrong, and
techniques of criticizing and constructing arguments.

**COURSE GOALS**  
The course is designed to enhance students¨ª abilities to read and listen
critically, to respond reflectively to arguments offered by others, to
distinguish successful and unsuccessful arguments, and to generate well-formed
arguments of their own.  In a broad sense, the course is intended to introduce
students to philosophical argumentation and reflection, and to develop skills
of reading, writing, and argumentation that are valuable in a number of
academic and everyday contexts.

A special feature of this course is its linkage with specific sections of ENGL
101 and SPCO 101.  The rationale for the linked sections of the Thought and
Expression courses is to reinforce the common objectives of developing
students¨ª abilities to understand and analyze written and spoken
communication, to understand the different purposes of written and spoken
communication, and to develop effective communication skills of their own.

**COURSE METHODOLOGY**  
While our use of class time will vary, we will focus class time on two
activities:  
1.  Review of material presented in the assigned reading from the text;  discussion of and review of assigned practice exercises.   
2.  Discussion and analysis of argumentative reading selections assigned for the day.   
I plan to keep lectures to a minimum and to emphasize student review of
homework problems, discussion, questions, and debate so far as is possible.
For this reason, it is essential for success in the course that students keep
up with the assigned readings and practice exercises and attend class
faithfully.

**GRADING**  
Grades for the class will be computed on the basis of the following sources:  
  1.  Course attendance, preparation, and participation | 10%  
---|---  
2.  Quizzes (3 quizzes;  lowest grade will be dropped) | 20%  
3.  Practice Reconstructions (5 at 1 point each) | 5%  
4.  Reconstruction Essay | 15%  
5.  Evidence Research Report | 5%  
6.  Argumentative Essay | 25%  
7.  Logic Exam | 20%  
  
 All required work must be completed successfully in order to pass the course.
Please get a manila file folder (not a mailing envelope!) to serve as your
class work file.  All written work for the course (graded papers, textbook
practice exercises, reconstructions, and so forth, but not class notes) should
be collected in this folder, which will be collected occasionally.  See
[Course Schedule](101sched.html) for deadlines.

1.  _Course Attendance, Preparation, and Participation_.   Participation will be graded on the basis of discussion and cooperation in working through assigned exercises.  Of course, this means that attendance is a critical part of the participation grade.  According to the standards specified in the Gonzaga University Catalogue, **no more than four absences will be permitted in this course** (see the Class Attendance Policy under [Academic Citizenship](http://www.gonzaga.edu/catalog/Ucatalog/!06DEG.HTM) for more details).  Failure to adequately prepare for class by reading the assigned material and doing the relevant exercises will have a seriously detrimental effect on your ability to do well on the class assignments, and therefore will affect your participation grade as well.  While I will not grade all of the written work in the class (practice exercises from the text will not be graded), you should keep this work in your course file.  Your cooperation and work in conducting the research part of the argumentative essay (see below) will also be counted in the course participation grade. 

2.  _Quizzes_.   The quizzes are intended to assess your understanding of basic logic (argument reconstruction, symbolization, and techniques of assessment).  They will be closely modeled on the homework assignments from the text.  There will be three quizzes;  the lowest of the three grades will be dropped.   
[Click here to view the sample quizzes](101quiz.html).

3.  _Practice Reconstructions_.   The five article reconstruction assignments (marked * on the schedule) are intended to give you practice in reading, understanding, and explaining arguments.  Practice reconstructions will be checked, and are worth one point each.  These assignments will help prepare you for the reconstruction essay.  For instructions on how to reconstruct arguments in extended articles, and for sample reconstruction essays, [click here](101recon.html). 

4.  _Reconstruction Essay_.     The reconstruction essay is a restatement of the key ideas in an extended magazine article (see the [Course Schedule](101sched.html) or check with me for the specific assignment).  The paper should include (1) a brief explanation of the topic of the argument, (2) a clear statement of the author¨ªs position, and (3) summary and explanation of the main reasons supporting the author¨ªs conclusion.  The paper should be no more than two double-spaced typed pages. Further information can be found in the Introduction and in Part 1 of the text (see especially Section 1.11).  [Click here to view reconstruction information and sample reconstruction essays](101recon.html#Sample Argument Reconstructions).   
  **NOTE** : The Reconstruction Essay is identical to the Summary paper
assigned in ENGL 101;  copies should be submitted to both instructors.

5.  _Evidence Research Report_.   As a way of getting started on the argumentative essay (see below), our first step will be to collect and analyze relevant information and evidence.  To facilitate this, we will hold a required class meeting in the library (meet in the library instruction room on the main floor, left past the circulation desk as you enter the main doors).  Basic research will be conducted in student groups, with whom you are encouraged to confer on your research findings, and to discuss the basic issues.  Each student should produce a basic research report (about two pages long), which should include (1) a one-paragraph statement of your research problem and (2) complete citations and brief reconstructions of the main lines of argument in at least six sources relevant to your topic.  See _The Craft of Thinking_ for the format for an bibliography entry (you may also want to consult your English composition handbook for information on using sources to prepare a paper).   The Research Report will be graded on a 5-point scale according to the clarity of the topic statement, the usefulness of the sources listed, and the clarity and depth of the reconstructions of the sources. 

 To ensure the greatest value for the group as a whole, students will research
and report on different evidence sources and share copies of their research
reports with one another.  This report will give me an early opportunity to
offer feedback to you on your argumentative essay, and will allow students to
benefit from and use information gathered by other students in their group.  
  **NOTE** : The Evidence Research Report is identical to the bibliography
assignment in ENGL 101;  copies should be submitted to both instructors.

6.  _Argumentative Essay_.   In this paper your job will be to select a topic of current interest and controversy, research the views of participants in the controversy and other informed sources, outline the major positions and key arguments in the controversy, and take a position of your own.  You should be very cautious to demonstrate that you are aware of the informational base concerning the issue, that you are conversant with various argumentative positions, and that you can respond critically to views different from your own.  Research for the Argumentative Essay will be done in groups.  While you are encouraged to discuss your research findings and argumentative position with your group members, the actual writing of the argumentative essay must be your own.  (Consequently, you need not agree with your fellow group members.)  The paper should be structured according to guidelines in Part 4 of the text (we will discuss the structure and writing of the essays in class), and should be five to six double-spaced typed pages.   
  **NOTE** : The argumentative essay is identical to the Argument paper
assigned in ENGL 101;  copies should be submitted to both instructors.

Sample Topics:  
In what cases, if any, should animals be used in scientific experiments?  
What are the best proposals for reforming welfare?  
What are the best policies to preserve and protect endangered species?  
What are the benefits and drawbacks of religious college education?

7.  _Logic Exam_.   The final exam will cover the mechanical aspects of critical thinking: basic argument reconstruction and symbolization, proofs, Venn diagrams, and fallacies.  To do well on the final exam you must memorize the basic patterns of deductive and inductive arguments, the inference rules, and the fallacies that are discussed in the text.  No notes or books will be allowed for the exam.  Alternate exam times will be allowed only with written approval from the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences.

**Important General Grading Information**  
1.  I am happy to read and comment on paper drafts.  Let me know and we will arrange a schedule for me to read and comment on papers before the due date.  For help in organizing and planning your paper, visit the Writing Lab in AD 134.   
2.  Papers failing to meet reasonable standards of writing quality will be returned to students for revision prior to grading.   
3.  Papers must be cleanly typed and proofread, and pages must be numbered.   
4.  Any research sources used in the research or writing of your papers must be properly documented in footnotes or endnotes.  The documentation style expected on papers for this class is the MLA style as explained in your English composition writing handbook.  Failure to properly credit consulted sources constitutes **plagiarism** , the serious academic offense of submitting someone else's work, ideas, or actual words as though they were your own.  The automatic penalty for plagiarism in this course is a grade of **zero** on the assignment, and there may be other consequences as well.   If you are unsure about your use of a source, document it.  (Proper use of sources is discussed in Section 2.6 of _The Craft of Thinking_ ).  Any other form of academic will be dealt with in a similar way.  See the Gonzaga University Catalogue section on [Academic Citizenship](http://www.gonzaga.edu/catalog/Ucatalog/!06DEG.HTM) for more information on academic honesty.   
5.  Always keep a computer disk copy or hard copy of any work you turn in.  If your paper is misplaced, you are responsible for providing a replacement copy.   
6.  Late papers will incur a penalty of 4 points for each day beyond the deadline, and will receive no written comments.   
7.  More than four absences will result in **automatic failure** of the course (see the GU Catalogue under [Academic Citizenship](http://www.gonzaga.edu/catalog/Ucatalog/!06DEG.HTM) for University attendance policy).

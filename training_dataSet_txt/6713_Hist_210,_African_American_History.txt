II. COURSE DESCRIPTION:
 
This course will examine the history of African Americans in
American society from 1619 to the present. Special attention will be devoted
to the unique contributions of African Americans to the cultural, economic,
intellectual, social, and technical development of the United States.


Unit I, will briefly examine the West African context of the first Africans,
their cultural retentions, and the new African American culture that emerged
from their interaction with European and other cultures in a new environment.
It will explore the topics of the slave trade, the varieties of the slave
experience, the acculturation or "seasoning" of Africans, the building
of a culturally cohesive African American cultural community, and the changing
character of American slavery will comprise much of the 17th and 18th century
discussion of the African American experience.

Unit II, will examine the emergence of the abolitionist movement, the status
of free blacks in the North and South, the Slave community, several manifestations
of slavery in the antebellum South, and the back to Africa movement of
the 1820s. It will devote special attention to African Americans' participation
in the Civil War and Reconstruction. The course will next explore the deteriorating
position of African Americans in postwar South and the nationalization
of the race issue in the late 19th century.

Unit III will continue to look at nationalization, furthered by the migration
from the South to the urban North and West in the 20th century. Special
attention will be given to the problems of civil, political, and social
rights for African Americans and the special significance of t the conflict
between separatists and integrationists. The course will investigate the
reasons for the flowering of art, literature, and ideas often associated
with the term "Harlem Renaissance." Finally the course will explore the
implications of the American economic and social changes for the status
and opportunities afforded African Americans.

V. EVALUATION CRITERIA/GRADING SCALE:
 
1. Grades will be based on three examinations, writing assignments,
and class participation. Each exam will be based on the units of study
immediately preceding it and will be written in a blue book which
may be purchased in the book store. The class may determine the size of
the blue book to be used.
 
 


Exams will each count 3 x 20%
60%


Individual Assignments
30%


Class Participation
10%


TOTAL
100%


 
 

NOTE: YOU SHOULD NEVER MISS A SCHEDULED EXAM. UNLESS THE ABSENCE
IS EXCUSED WITH PROPER DOCUMENTATION, THE MAKE-UP EXAM GRADE WILL BE REDUCED
BY ONE LETTER GRADE AS A PENALTY FOR ABSENCE. MAKE-UP EXAMS ARE AT THE
SOLE DISCRETION OF THE INSTRUCTOR.


SPECIAL NOTE ON ACADEMIC HONESTY: Students should be aware that
a university is a community of scholars committed to the discovery and
dissemination of knowledge and truth. Without the freedom to investigate
all materials, scrupulous honesty in reporting findings, and proper acknowledgment
of credit, such a community can not survive. Students are expected to adhere
to the highest traditions of scholarship. Any infractions of these traditions,
such as plagiarism, are not tolerated. Though we do not anticipate any
such occurrence, for the record, misrepresenting someone else's words or
ideas as one's own, constitutes plagiarism. In cases where plagiarism occurs,
the instructor has the right to penalize the student(s) as he or she thinks
appropriate. One guide line holds that the first offence = failure of the
assignment; the second offence = failure of the course.


Grades and their numerical equivalents are as follows:

 
 



Numerical Limits


Letter Grades




90 and above 


A 




80-89 


B 




70-79 


C 




60-69 


D

2. INSTRUCTOR POLICIES
 
a. MAKE-UP WORK


EXAMS: Unless the absence is excused with proper documentation,
the make-up exam grade with be reduced by one letter grade as a penalty
for absence. Make-up exams are at the sole discretion of the instructor.
Missed
exams caused by an excused absence must be made up WITHIN ONE WEEK
unless illness or emergency necessitates a longer absence from school.

Missed due date of the assignment. This applies to writing assignments--SUBTRACT
ONE LETTER GRADE.

No make-up work will be accepted the last week of classes.

b. EXTRA CREDIT may be earned through cultural reaction papers turned
in with the exam.
c. As a rule, I do not give an incomplete. If you choose not to complete

VI. COURSE REQUIREMENTS:
Assignments: Assignments for this class will include reading,
writing, and special projects to include:


Film Review--Guide

Group Work--Textbook Evaluation Project--Guide

Current Events Notebook--Guide


Attendance and Punctuality: Students are responsible for
material covered and assignments.
Class Participation: All students are expected to come to class
prepared to discuss the assigned material, so it is important to complete
all the assigned readings before coming to class. Any student
may, at any time, be called upon to recite or to write a short essay on
the assigned material. Short quizzes may be given on assigned materials
at any time. Students are expected to understand the material,
or at least have identified those items that they do not yet understand
in order to ask question in class. The instructor will assume that students
know the material and are prepared to discuss it. Students are responsible
for all work assigned in this class, whether or not they are present. Assignments
must be completed on time.
Students are expected to observe normal courtesy in class. They are
expected to pay attention to the instructor, to take detailed notes, to
refrain from personal conversations, and to avoid any other behavior which
is disruptive and disturbing to others. A student who does not observe
these courtesies may be asked to leave the room.
This course is designed to help improve your proficiency in note-taking,
library skills, logical and analytical thinking and writing, and critical
evaluation.

VII. TEACHING STRATEGIES
 
The mode of presentation for the course will be lecture/student discussion.
There will be opportunities for cooperative learning. I encourage peer
teaching and recommend students to work together through study groups.
I want to emphasize the critical analysis of data--information you read
and see on film/video and the communication of your ideas supported by
facts. While these skills are important to the course work at hand, they
are most important in your life's work where you read, listen, evaluate,
articulate, communicate your understanding, ideas, and opinions on a daily
basis. These activities will give you practice in these areas.

**Introduction  ** | TESTING - PARTICIPATION - GRADES  
---|---  
|  
**Requirements                 ** | Assignments: There will be four major
sections to this course. Each section will have Text Reading Assignments,
Lecture Notes, On-Line Summaries, and Bulletin Board Discussions. Each section
will cover 2-4 chapters in the Text. The Assignments will be clearly stated on
the Course Calendar attached to this class.

Exams: There will be 4 Major Exams over each section of the course. These
Exams will be graded on a 100 point scale. These Exams will primarily be given
over the internet with strict time limits. Arrangements can be made for any
student who would rather come to campus or obtain a proctor and take the test
with the proctor without the time limits. These Exams will be scheduled on the
Course Calendar and students will be given 3-5 days to pick out a convenient
time to take the Exam on-line.

Discussions: There will be a discussion question posted each week. These
questions will require a short response from the students. Each question will
be graded on a 10 point scale. Therefore 10 out of approximately 15 responses
will count toward one grade on a 100 point scale.

Grading: Each Major Exam will be worth 25% of the overall grade in the course.
A student may drop the lowest grade on one of the first 3 Exams. The final
will count for all students. The participation in the Bulletin Board
Discussions will count as 25% of your grade.

# How to use the course web

For a number of reasons, I have chosen to make many of the handouts for this
course available only in electronic format on the World-Wide Web. I will go
over basic use of the Web and you should make sure to ask me if you have any
questions about using the World-Wide Web.

The course web can be found at
[`http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS152/99F/`](http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS152/99F/)
You may want to bookmark that page.

A number of important pieces of information are in the course web, including
assignments, readings, requirements, syllabus, and office hours. I assume that
if I put information on the Web, you will (eventually) read it.

  * At the bare minimum, you should read all the pieces of [basic information](../index.html) about the course. Of particular interest is the [syllabus](syllabus.html), which lists all the readings. I will also hand out a copy of this information on the first day of class. 
  * I prepare a rough [outline](../Outlines/index.html) for each class. Most students find these useful, and you should feel free to refer to them before, during, and after class. Since this class is becoming more lab-based, it is likely that in laboratory sessions there will be more information in the outlines than I will cover in class. 

At the top and bottom of every page are a series of links to important
components of the course web. These are

  * [Instructions](instructions.html). This set of instructions. 
  * [Search](../search.cgi). A simple search facility for the course web. 
  * [Current](../Outlines/current.html). The outline of the current or next class. You may need to reload the page to get the appropriate version. 
  * [Syllabus](syllabus.html). The course syllabus. 
  * [Links](links.html). A collection of links that you might find useful. 
  * [Handouts](index.html). Handouts for the class. 
  * [Outlines](../Outlines/index.html). The outlines of classes that have been held. You can sometimes access other outlines through the [syllabus](syllabus.html). 
  * [Labs](http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/ExptInJava/index.html) _Experiments in Java_ , the laboratory manual used for the first few weeks of class. 
  * [More Labs](../Labs/index.html). Additional laboratory assignments. The manual (previous link) is intended to give you an introduction to Java. The later labs will introduce you to the various topics we cover in this course. 
  * [Assignments](../Assignments/index.html). A list of the assignments for the class. 
  * [Examples](../Examples/index.html). A list of examples generated for this class. 
  * [Book](http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/JPDS/index.html). The textbook for the class (or a current draft thereof). for this and other courses. 
  * [Tutorial](file:///home/rebelsky/References/JavaTutorial/index.html). A local online copy of _The Java Tutorial_. This is a useful introduction to the Java programming language. 
  * [API](http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/jdk/docs/api/packages.html). Documentation for the standard Java libraries. 

## History

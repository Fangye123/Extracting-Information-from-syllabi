**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**

     Lectures in the course will focus on the molecular mechanisms responsible for cell function. In the main, eukaryotic cells will be discussed; however, prokaryotic cells and viruses will be discussed under several topics. The subject matter of the course includes: **Anatomy and Function of Animal and Plant Cell Organelles; Evolution of Cells; Structure and Function of Water and Macromolecules; Mechanisms of Energy Production; Mechanisms Involved in Maintenance of Cellular Homeostasis as well as Growth and Division, including Control of Gene Expression; Characteristics of Cell Junctions and the Extracellular Matrix; Mechanisms of Cell Signaling; and Methods of Cell Study.**   
    


**_EVALUATION_**

After 10 lectures have been presented, a major examination will be given (in
approximately 3 week intervals). Four major examinations are scheduled on the
following days: Feburary 5, March 2, April 4, and May 2 (the last day of
class). Each exam is worth 100 points and will cover the information presented
in the previous 10 lectures. All major exams are given at 6 p.m. and do not
include the lecture presented on the day of the exam. Five (5) to six (6)
unannounced quizzes will be given during the semester (each 10 minutes in
length). Each quiz is worth 20 points and will test your knowledge of the
material presented in the **_two lectures_** immediately preceding the quiz.
Homework assignments will be given throughout the course, each worth 3 - 5
bonus points, requiring that students describe means of testing hypotheses
and/or work problems pertaining to lecture material. **A _comprehensive_ final
exam worth 150 points will be given on the assigned day during the final exam
period (May 7-11).**

Your final grade will be determined by dividing the total points that you have
amassed on all exams and quizzes by the point value of all of the exams and
quizzes. The decimal fraction obtained will be converted to a percentage (by
multiplying times 100) and letter grades will then be assigned as described
below:  
    
    
    
    
    
  **A+   97 - 100 ** | **A      90 - 96 ** | **A-   88 - 89**  
---|---|---  
**B+   85 - 87 ** | **B      80 - 84 ** | **B-   77 - 79**  
**C+   75 - 76 ** | **C     70 - 74 ** | **C-   68 - 69**  
**D+   65 - 67 ** | **D     60 - 64 ** | **D-   57 - 59**  
                                                                                                                                                              **F   56 & Below**   
    
    
    


**_LABORATORY_**

The laboratory component of the course is optional, but in order to satisfy
the requirements for the Biology major, either the Cell Biology or Physiology
Laboratory must be successfully completed. The grade for the Cell Biology
Laboratory is determined independently of the grade for the lecture component
of the course. Upon successful completion of the laboratory, the student will
receive one (1) credit hour.

The objectives of the laboratory are to expose students to approaches used to
answer questions in science and also to familiarize them with methods used in
the field of Cell Biology. The initial laboratory sessions will show students
how to use basic equipment in the laboratory, including the microscope and
propipettors, and how to make solutions. Several sessions will follow, during
which students will prepare tissues for and examine them with the electron
microscope. The aim of other laboratory sessions will be to: 1) fractionate
and characterize cellular organelles and cell membrane proteins; 2) prepare
cells for and maintain them in culture; and 3) to use immunocytochemical
procedures to identify specific cell proteins.

**_CLASS ATTENDANCE_** (The description below is found on p. 36 in the
2000-2001 Morehouse College catalog).

Class attendance is required of all students at Morehouse College. Each
student is allowed as many unexcused absences as credit hours for the course.
For example, a student is allowed three unexcused absences for a three credit
hour course. A student is expected to attend all classes and not absent
himself without adequate cause. It is the responsibility of the student to
make up scheduled work missed because of officially excused class absences.
Absences from announced tests and other assignments may be made up at the
discretion of the instructor.

Instructors are expected to outline their attendance requirements at the
beginning of the semester and to include these requirements in the course
syllabus issued to students. They are required to maintain attendance records
on all students, and at the request of the Provost and Senior Vice President
for Academic Affairs, report any student who exceeds the maximum number of
unexcused absences. Students who exceed the maximum number of unexcused
absences may receive a failing grade in the course.

**_RESERVED MATERIAL AND AUDIOVISUALS_**

Reference books, audiovisuals, articles and exams from previous years are
available in the Biology Department Office. Please see the department
secretary.

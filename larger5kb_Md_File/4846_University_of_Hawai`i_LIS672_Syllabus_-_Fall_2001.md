**Course Description**  
This course is a survey of the theories, concepts, methods and practices
relating to the automation of libraries.

**Prerequisite**  
LIS 670 Introduction to Information Storage and Retrieval or LIS 605 Basic
Cataloging & Classification

**Course Learning Objectives**  
At the end of this course students should:

  1. Understand the basic functions and configuration of computer systems; types of computers; and peripheral equipment used in library applications. 
  2. Be able to distinguish the types of software used in libraries and understand their functions. 
  3. Be able to participate in the process of system specification, selection, and procurement. 
  4. Understand the role(s) of consultants in the automation process. 
  5. Understand the MARC record and its importance to library automation. 
  6. Be able to plan and participate in a retrospective conversion process. 
  7. Understand the main objectives and approaches to the automation of the various functions in the library. 

**Teaching Method**  

_**Class meetings**_ **** will combine lecture, demos, presentations and
discussions.  In addition to lectures, students will be expected to complete
practical exercises in the planning and use of library automation apparatus
and systems. For each class session, students should have completed the
assigned readings, bringing questions and comments to the class.  
Early in the semester students will form teams and will explore a s **pecial
topic on Library Automation**. The results of the special topic analysis will
be presented orally to the class, during the semester.  
Students will participate in a _**course project.**_ Each team will
periodically present informal reports of their progress to the class. Final
results of the project will be presented to the class, both orally and in
written form at the end of the semester.  
**_Website_** ** _:_** Students will use _**WebCT**_ to form teams and to
complement class discussions.

**Assignments.**

  1. Examine the hardware configuration of an automated system used in a media center or small library.See details in AMC: chapter 3: Activity, page 37. 
  2. Explore a LAN's hardware and software requirements in a media center or small library. Evaluate peformance and capacity of the LAN with respect to its existing and future applications. See details in AMC, chapter 7: Activity, pag. 140. 
  3. Compare and contrast three OPACS. Hawai`i Voyager may be one of the three; instructions for accessing others will be distributed in class. Systems may be accessed via WWW or telnet. You are limited to three pages of 12 point type with one inch margins all around. 
  4. Compare and contrast three circulation modules. You can include Macintosh, Windows or Unix systems. You are limited to three pages of 12 point type with one inch margins all around. 

**Final Project  
** The final project should be a preliminary plan for automating a library of
your choice. It may be a real library, or one you make up, although real
libraries are preferred. Be sure you have specified the _type_ of library
(academic, public, school, corporate, etc.), and its _size_ (small, medium,
large). Your document should include sections describing the library and its
environment, functions to be automated, preliminary (broad) specifications,
possible approaches (including specific vendors), physical considerations,
files needed and their creation, milestones (including a rough timetable), and
a short list of useful publications. Assume you are presenting this document
to upper management and/or a funding body. While factual correctness and
appropriateness are the major determinate of grades, appearance and
presentation (e.g. diagrams, indexes, fonts used, etc.) will also be
important. **The finall project report is due _December 8_.**

**Class and WebCT participation, discussion leadership:**  
**Attendance will be taken** and students will lose 4 points for each class
missed without permission. Full credit will be awarded only to students who
have near-perfect attendance, participate meaningfully (and non-obstructively)
in class discussions, and create an atmosphere of collegial participation when
leading discussion.

**Technology requirements**  
You will be expected to play with systems installed on both Macs and IBMs.
Ability to use a WWW browser is essential, since some remote systems can only
be accessed in this way. You will also be expected to telnet to a unix server,
log on, and execute a program. It is your responsibility to attain the level
of expertise necessary to do this. It is essential that you have a uhunix
account. Students are expected to check their email daily. This course also
requires the use of WebCT to access course materials and to conduct
discussions with the professor and your classmates.

**Students with disabilities**  
If you are a student with a special need as defined by the Americans with
Disabilities Act, please fell free to discuss this with me at your earliest
convenience.

**Course Schedule**  
(The following schedule will not necessarily be strictly followed, however
students are expected to have all assignments completed before the class
session unless otherwise instructed.)

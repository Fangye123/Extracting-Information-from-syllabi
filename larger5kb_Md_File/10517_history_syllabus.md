_Description:_ The history of the media is the history of struggle. It is a
battle waged over words and images: who produces them, who has access to them,
and whose interests are served by them. Media power has traditionally been the
province of elites, from Church and State to multinational communication
conglomerates. But this is only one side of the story, for everyday people
have also fought for their right to speak and be spoken to. Media has moved
from the elite to the masses, in the process becoming "democratized," but also
often commodified. Beginning with the printed word, and moving from the Bible
through plays and popular song; pamphlets, penny press and advertisements; and
ending with the radio, this course will use the history of the word to explore
enduring questions of power and culture.  
  
_Requirements:_ 1) Attendance, diligent reading, and active participation in
all class discussions.  
2) Three short essays--8 pages each--over the course of the semester.  
  
_Notes:_  
¡¤ I'm always open to suggestions on assignments. A video, poem, song,
performance, web page, etc. in place of one of the written assignments is
possible and could be very exciting. Just talk to me first.  
¡¤ All papers handed in on time can be re-written for new grades, but the re-
write must returned within two weeks of first receiving back the corrected
paper.

**description:** This course concerns the history of Greece from c.1200 B.C.
to c.350 B.C., that is, from the end of the Mycenaean Age to Philip of
Macedon, father of Alexander the Great. During this span of time, there
emerged from a period of general poverty and under-population, commonly termed
the Dark Age (c.1200-c.750 B.C.), an era of remarkable growth and innovation,
known as the Archaic Age (c.750-c.480 B.C.). Influenced by new contacts with
Asia and Africa and new opportunities in the larger mediterranean world,
Archaic Greece developed a diverse and dynamic culture which, among many other
things, increased the value placed on the individual, freed expression and
speculation, and adopted the use of writing in the aid of these things. Events
and achievements in Greece in the 5th and 4th centuries, particularly in
Athens, are commonly said to comprise the Classical Age (c. 480-323 B.C.). How
Classical Greece built on its heritage of social, political, literary and
intellectual innovation will be a question of interest. The course ends in the
4th century, with Philip of Macedon the dominant political figure, and
Alexander soon to conquer Egypt and the East. His conquests (covered in
History 330) created the environment of the Hellenistic world, through which
Greek culture and the 'idea of Greece' was disseminated. History 329 will
attempt to shed light on how Greece came to be able to make its unrivaled
contribution to world culture.  
  
**course structure:** In covering the material just described, the course will
follow a tripartite structure. First, an overview will introduce the geography
of Greece and conventional chronological divisions that are used in describing
its history. Second, primary texts and a book on the lives of ancient Greeks
will be read in connection with important topics in Greek history and culture.
Finally, we will read two recent studies of ancient Greece, plus reviews of
the works, for their content and for the insights they can provide into the
methods and habits of thought and inquiry that constitute the historian's
craft.  
  
**course components and grading:  
  
**_class_ : Class-time will normally be spent discussing readings and their
relation to issues and questions of historical interest. Special
responsibilities in leading class discussions will be assigned in the third
part of the course.  
_tests_ : There will be a mid-term (October 8) and a final exam (Saturday,
Dec. 13, 9 a.m.).  
_paper_ : An 8-10 page research paper will be due on November 17.  
  
**final grade:** class - 15%, mid-term - 25%, paper - 30%, final exam - 30%  
  
**additional requirement:** The class is required to attend the performance of
Aristophanes' comedy _The Birds_ on October 23 at 8:00 p.m. in the Jepson

**attendance:** You are expected to attend all classes, and to be ready and
willing to contribute to class discussions. Having more than three cuts, or
making a habit of being unprepared, may hurt your final grade.

Overview

_

This doctoral seminar embraces a concern for macro-organizational theory,
micro-organizational behavior, organizational change, and organizational
design. Its content is informed by a wide variety of philosophical traditions,
social sciences, and social theories about how organizations behave as well as
how people within organizations behave. It also focuses on broader public
policy contexts in which organizational decision making is used to effect
political, economic, and social changes in modern society. By the end of the
semester, you should have a broad understanding of the variety of theoretical
perspectives that contribute to a scholarly understanding of modern public
organizations and their constantly changing functions in a democratic society.
Prerequisite: Admission to the doctoral program and permission of the
instructor.

Perspectives_

The following is a list of different perspectives on organizations and the
lives that people lead in them. They represent different views of
organizational dynamics that have a direct bearing on public policy and public
management. At times these views are complimentary. At times they conflict.
Collectively, they show how public organizations and the people who manage
them effect public policy and carry out the day to day functioning of
organizations concerned with the public good.

Requirements_

There are three primary requirements in this seminar: 1) class participation,
2) scholarly book reviews, and 3) book notes.

1\. Class participation in seminar discussions is central to your learning and
development as doctoral students. Each week one or two of you will be picked
to lead the seminar in a discussion of the assigned books or articles. You
should call on others to present their views of the main points made by the
authors and you should also present your views of the main points. You will be
evaluated on the quality and the clarity of the points and questions that you
raise, and your ability to lead an engaging intellectual discussion. (20% of
seminar grade)

2\. There will be several required book reviews. The book reviews entail more
than just a synopses of what the author or authors have written. You must take
a position either agreeing or disagreeing with the author or authors, give
sound reasons for your agreements or disagreements, and situate your positions
in the context of your general knowledge of organizational dynamics. The book
reviews should range from ten to fifteen double spaced, word processed pages.
(50% of seminar grade)

3\. There will be several required book or article notes. Three are mandatory
as indicated in the schedule. The other notes are for the books that you do
not review in full. These notes are a word processed outline of the major
points made by the author or authors. You will be expected to talk from these
notes about why you think the major points are important. You may also
disagree with the major points but you must give your reasons for
disagreement. Each member of the seminar will be called on to present and
discuss the major points contained in their book or article notes. (30% of
seminar grade)

4\. You are expected to have access to an e-mail account. An e-mail
distribution list will be provided to each of you. At times, I may ask that
the book notes and book reviews be submitted to me via e-mail by the Monday
before each Wednesday=s class.

Policies

_

1\. Attendance and participation in seminar discussions are essential to your
learning. You will be allowed one excused absence from class. Please contact
me before your absence so that I may approve it. Unfortunately, being absent
for more than one class will result in the lowering of your final course grade
by one letter grade unless you are willing to produce an additional book
review for each additional absence that is not excused.

2\. Please come to class on time. Lateness disrupts learning. Repeatedly being
late will result in the lowering of your final course grade by one letter
grade.

3\. Handing in assignments late means that you will not be prepared to engage
in the learning process. Consequently, late assignments will be penalized one
half letter grade for each day that they are late.

4\. Please read and abide by the University's polices on Academic Integrity,
Plagiarism, and Ethical Conduct as contained in the current Graduate Catalog.

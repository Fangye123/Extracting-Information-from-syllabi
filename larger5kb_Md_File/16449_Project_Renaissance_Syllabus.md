>> **Introduction:** This syllabus provides additional information about the
sections that will be taught by Jon Scott and Pingping Fu. Please note, this
syllabus is supplemental to, and does not replace, the core syllabus you
received. The purpose of this additional course outline is to provide you with
readings and activities to be covered in small sessions. It also tells you in
details our expectations for class participation, conference participation,
and attendance as well as our plans for coverage of communications and
technology competency development.

>>

>> ### Required Readings

>>

>>      Your additional readings for the discussion sessions are available at
Shipmates.

>>

>> ### Writing assignments

>>

>>     There are three types of writing assignments: informal journal
writings, computer conference, and formal paper writings.

>>

>>     _Journal writings._ All students are required to keep a journal (leaf
paper in a boundary recommended) where you will write informally about the
topics and issues being considered under the general heading of human identity
and technology. Examples of topics are: comments on reading assignments;
comments on readings, presentations, and discussions; descriptions of personal
experiences that have influenced your thinking on issues or topics in the
course; and reactions to current events that are related to course topics.

>>

>>      Journal entries should be no longer than one side of a letter-size
paper. You may be asked to write something within a time limit in class.
Entries for outside class may be handwritten or typed, but in either case,
they should be neat and professional in their presentation. You are expected
to keep all the journal writings in the boundary and will be asked to hand
them in periodically. The two instructors will take turns reading submissions
from the two sections. Since this writing is informal, grades will be based on
the substance and creativity of your discussion, rather than on your spelling,
grammar, syntax, or organization.

>>

>>     _Computer conference._ All students are required to post a response
every other week to a directed question(s) that will be posted by the two
course instructors. The purpose of the computer conference is to allow
students and faculty to take the discussion of course material beyond what is
allowed within the time limitations of the classroom setting. Questions will
thus be drawn from the topics and issues raised in the readings and class
discussions. Please note, your ability to respond to the computer conference
will depend on your consistent reading of assigned material and class
attendance. You should also be aware that the other instructors will also be
posting questions for their sections and you are welcome to read and
contribute to the other discussions in addition to answering the required
topics for our sections.

>>

>>      Conference questions will be announced in class after they are posted
every time. You are expected to respond within the two period. Late entries
will not be considered without prior permission of an instructor. Grades for
the conference entries will be based on the substance and creativity of your
discussion, rather than on your spelling, grammar, syntax, or organization.

>>

>>     _Formal writings._ In addition to the written team project required by
the core course, all students are required to write three substantive, five to
six page papers during the semester, approximately one paper per month. The
assignment will be given two weeks ahead. The purpose of these in-depth
writings will be for students to integrate several weeks of discussions,
readings, library research and world wide web exploration into a focused and
well-developed essay. Specific requirements will be given when the assignment
is made.

>>

>>      The papers are due roughly at the end of each month. Due dates are
listed in the schedule. Students will be required to rewrite and resubmit if
the instructors think it is necessary. The rewritten version has to be handed
in within a week after the return of the original in order to be re-evaluated.
Late papers, either original or rewritten, will not be accepted without prior
permission from an instructor. As a formal paper, all evaluations will be
based on the mechanics of written language (grammar, sentence structure,
vocabulary, spelling, organization) and content (ideas expressed, strength of
argument, validity of research).

>>

>> ### Tentative Schedules

>>

>>     The schedules about the readings and activities are tentative, because
as we move along, new readings may be added, the readings included in the
packet may be replaced. Also, the activities and topics for the sessions are
also subject to change. Therefore, they only serve as a guideline.

>>

>>     Please note, students are expected to have finished reading the
articles listed for the day under "reading" and be ready to write or discuss
in class about the materials covered in that reading.

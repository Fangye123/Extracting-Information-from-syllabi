Oct. 8: No class. Will be rescheduled later

Please note: Each of you, with two others, will be responsible for leading us
through one session, beginning with #5 and ending with #8. Each gang of three
can either lead the discussion as a team or divide up the session and lead
parts of it. I expect that the student-led discussion will occupy 1 1/2- 2
hours of the seminar.

As the basis for leading the session, each person will prepare a report on the
key book of 5-10 pages. I want you to get at the key issues it addresses and
develop your own analysis/ critique of the book. Can you go back and see what
others have had to say on the book? Sure. BUT if you do that, you must make
sure that you cite any sources and quote any quotes. And you should regard
others' ideas only as starting points for developing your own.

As to the final paper: Please present me with a proposal no later than the
class of Dec. 3. As I said, the idea is to analyze a text in terms of the
issues of gender raised by one or more of the readings, those directed to this
subject or others. A "text" might be a book (e.g., a current novel, memoir, or
short story collection), a movie, a political event (like the Million Man
March or the 1996 election), an advertising campaign (e.g., for a beer or
perfume or computer), and the like. Obviously, I'm interested in seeing how
the work of the term has enabled you to examine texts utilizing the
theoretical tools developed by folks who "do" American Studies.

I do not want a book review, much less a book report. I do not want a sermon
about the oppression of women or anyone else. Remember the ways in which
writers like Ohmann, Kaplan, Trachtenberg, and others do two or three things:
they develop a thesis; they marshall evidence to support it; and they
generally examine one or more particular texts to show how such writings
illustrate or embody their thesis. That's the kind of thing I want you to try
your hand at.

The paper should be 15-20 pages in length. It should come in before Christmas
(but if it doesn't, that won't be a big problem.

I have ordered the following books, which we will be reading all or part of
when they come in:

Henry Nash Smith, _Virgin Land_ Leo Marx, _The Machine in the Garden_ Annette
Kolodny, _The Lay of the Land_ Alan Trachtenberg, _The Incorporation of
America_ W.E.B. DuBois, _The Souls of Black Folks_ David Roediger, _The Wages
of Whiteness_ Richard Ohmann, _Selling Culture_ George Sanchez, _Becoming
Mexican American_ |

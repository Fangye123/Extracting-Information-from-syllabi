>  Prof. Mary Beaudry  
>  Fall 2000**

>

>  
>  **Aims of the course**  
>  This course is intended to serve both as an introduction to the field of
historical archaeology in general and as an overview of the archaeological
evidence for life in the Americas in the early modern era. Topics covered
include the development of historical archaeology as a distinct subfield of
archaeology, its definitions and theoretical perspectives; the spread of
European culture into non-European areas; contact between Europeans and native
Americans; the development of regional folk cultures in 17th-century America;
the rise of popular culture in the 18th century; military and civilian life in
the colonial era; and archaeological studies of early American gardens and
landscapes. Students gain familiarity with the material signature of
colonization, ethnogenesis, and cultural development through a review of
archaeological and architectural remains and artifacts found at British,
French, Dutch, and Spanish sites throughout the Americas.  
>  
>  **Assignments and grading**  
>  Students are expected to attend all classes and to complete all of the
assigned readings. Regular classes will be conducted in a combined
lecture/seminar format; graduate students will also meet weekly for a
separate, hour-long seminar session. AR770 students will be graded on class
participation and preparation, on assigned in-class presentations, and on a
25-30 page research paper.

>  Readings indicated on the syllabus with an asterisk (*) will be available
in the Course Documents folder on the course web site (see below); anything
too large for me to scan in will be placed on reserve in the Stone Science
Archaeology and Remote Sensing Library. For on-line readings (normally web
sites devoted to a particular archaeological project), a hyperlink to the
appropriate location on the World Wide Web has been provided on the on-line
syllabus as well as on the External Links page of the course web site. Please
note that neither the required texts nor the on-line readings will be on
reserve in Stone.  
>  
>  **Texts**  
>  Required texts are available for purchase at the Barnes  & Noble Boston
University Bookstore; all other readings for the course will be available
either on the course web site (articles) or on reserve in the Stone Science
Library (books and monographs that I want you to skim). (Note: while journal
articles will be available on the course web site, journals such as Historical
Archaeology will not be placed on reserve. The relevant volumes can be found
in the stacks; out of consideration for fellow students, please be sure to
return each volume to its proper location after you've used it.)

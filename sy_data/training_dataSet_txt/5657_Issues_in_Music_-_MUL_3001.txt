Course
Description: The Issues in Music course content
is delivered through a series of 12 one hour televised programs, which consist
of musical performances and commentary. Additionally, there are three two-hour
class sessions, which take place on campus with the course instructor.
Additional contact between student and instructor is facilitated through regular
office hours (by telephone or in person). Content of the campus sessions range
from introductory materials, instruction (particularly as concerns Aaron
Copland's concepts of "What To Listen For In Music"), and to
assessment.
This course is designed to involve the student in the concert hall experience.
Performances by artist faculty consist of significant works of classical, jazz
and the music of other cultures. Analysis and discussion of these works
accompany performances. Everything is designed to involve the student in a
discussion centered around the question, "What is today's music?" 
 
This
course is designed for students who have a background in music. 
What constitutes a background in music?  For example, do you play a musical
instrument?  Have you taken music lessons? Did you study music in high
school?  Do you sing in a choir?  If so, this course is probably
suited for you.  If you do not have a background in music, it is
recommended that you either drop this course and take another telecourse, or consider
taking another music course "Music in Your
Life" with Professor Larry Cullison MUL 3012 Reference #52116 which meets
MWF from 2:00 - 4:15pm in FAH 101 in Session A .  Music in Your Life is an
introductory western art music course designed for the student who has never had
a music course and/or has no musical background.

                In
the video "What makes music symphonic? ; What is classical music?"
Leonard Bernstein uses works by Beethoven, Mozart, Haydn, Bach and Handel to

music developed from the 18th to the 19th century.

Bernstein's young people's concerts  with the New York Philharmonic / Video
Music Education, Inc. ; a presentation of the Leonard Bernstein Society, New
York ; produced and directed by Roger Englander is a video collection of ten

symphonic? Jazz in the concert hall.

additional resource material available for listening, viewing, and for checking
out.  There are many operas on CD, videocassette, and cassette available to

On
  the front cover page, your name and SSN must be in the top right corner of the
  paper DOUBLE STAPLED or CLIPPED on the upper left corner securely.  Please turn in
  assignments with separate cover sheets, for example, your notes from videos

  that must also be turned in with a separate cover sheet. Also, then turn in
  your notes from videos 7-12 with a separate cover sheet. Please put your name

mark your calendar immediately with exam dates so that you know in advance when
your exams are scheduled.  Upon receipt of the syllabus, if you see a
conflict it is your responsibility to inform Dr. Jaworski as well as the

                It is the student's responsibility to turn in your original
                TYPED notes and keep a photocopy for yourself!!!  Students
                who turn in work that is hand written and not typewritten will

                Students who fail to bubble in their SSN's and names on the
                scantron sheet will not get a grade for the exam as the
                instructor will not be able to identify which scantron is yours

                course.

Orientation and Review Meetings: Meetings will be taped if you cannot attend the actual meeting. The first 2 meetings are available for viewing in (or overnight checkout from) the office of Distance Learning Student Support in SVC 1072. Attendance is taken at all meetings, and failure to attend class or to view the video of the meetings may affect your grade. It is very important for your success that you attend or view these class meetings. 
                The orientation and review tapes from Spring 2002 are available
                in SVC 1072 for viewing or for overnight checkout for those who
                are unable to attend the voluntary review sessions.

Attention Students: Two one hour videos of Issues in Music
                are shown on WUSF-TV twice per week and it is recommended and important that you TAPE the programs as that will facilitate note taking of the programs since you can pause your VCR during playback as you are taking notes.  Students should NOT rely on the overnight block feed as their sole source of viewing the programs.  Please read the information at the end of the syllabus regarding the overnight blockfeed.  It's purpose is to provide you with an additional opportunity to obtain any videos you may have missed during the regular weekly broadcasts.

Attention Students:
We recommend that you tape the programs as they are being broadcast on WUSF-TV channel 16 on a weekly basis.
We do NOT recommend that you rely on the block feed/overnight broadcast as your only means of seeing the videos  because:
A)  Your VCR could malfunction
B)  Your power could go off
C)   You could forget to set your VCR
D)  WUSF-TV could have broadcasting difficulties
Also, it is not a valid excuse to request special consideration from the instructor (ie: makeup exam, ) if there is a technical problem with the overnight broadcast. Therefore, tape the programs off the air during the weekly broadcasts, and then if you missed any of the programs, the overnight broadcast/block feed will enable you to view the programs you missed.

Annotated
Bibliography
**An
annotated bibliography in which each source has been examined and the author
provides commentary on the source. The commentary usually comes in paragraph or
outline form directly under the citation. (See examples)  This is a
reminder that the annotated bibliography, like the notes, are to be completed by
the individual student, not in groups.  No credit will be given for any
duplicated work.  Students who do not abide by this will be subject to
being reviewed by the University's Policies on Plagiarism.

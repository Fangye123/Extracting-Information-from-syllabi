This proximity has affected Latin      American economics, demographics, culture, and politics. The      seminar will begin with a look at three major case studies that      demonstrate this influence: the Mexican Revolution, the Guatemalan      Revolution, and the Alliance for Progress. The major assignment      in the course is a research paper.   Return toTop     Readings      should be completed prior to the class meeting for which they      are listed.

During the last      six weeks, the class readings will focus on the research projects.(See Paper      Overview) Class participation is an integral part of the      course, so attendance is mandatory. Please note that most of the      readings are available for purchase. Many are also on reserve.      For purposes of discussion, be prepared to define (1) the authors      main point, (2) the type of evidence used to make that point,      (3) your assessment of whether the evidence and argument convincingly      sustain the conclusions, and (4) the relationship to other works      we have read.

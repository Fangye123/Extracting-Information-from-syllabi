Exams |

There will be six short exams, spaced evenly throughout the course. Each exam
will be scheduled immediately following the completion of the set of topics
scheduled to be covered on the exam (so plan well and get your reading done as
the semester proceeds). You may drop the lowest of these short exams, but you
must take each exam.  If you miss an exam, you will make up that exam during
the final exam class period. During the final exam period, you may re-take any
of the exams that you would like and substitute the later test grade.  If you
are happy with your grades you have going into the final period, you do not
need to take more exams (motivation!!).  There are three important points
highlighted in this course that our style of exam-taking reflect:   (1) that
you learn how to think about psychology by reading and discussing well-written
material; (2) that you learn how to access information about psychology from
good, college-level sources, and (3) that _you_ master the material.    The
UHD _Academic Honesty Policy_ will be enforced (PS 03.A.19).  
  
**ADA** |  UHD adheres to all applicable federal, state, and local laws,
regulations, and guidelines with respect to providing reasonable
accommodations for students with disabilities. Students with disabilities
should register with Disabled Student Services (713-221-8430; 409-S) and
contact me in a timely manner to arrange for appropriate accommodations  
  
Research |

You will also have the chance to participate in various research projects.
Each time you participate, you will receive extra points to add to your exam
grades. Particular events in the community can count towards extra points also
(maybe there is an important lecture or film in town, etc.). I will let you
know!  
Journal | You are to keep a journal during the semester -- making one entry
per week. I will let you know when the journals are due.  Six journal entries
will be graded during the semester, and one entry will be dropped.  An entry
is defined as one article plus a written description of its relevance to the
course and readings.  Click here for a complete description.  15 % of course.

Hints |

Here is my philosophy on exams and grading at the college level: I expect you
to make a decision _early_ in the semester regarding what grade you would like
to make in this course.   Then, you need to do what is necessary to achieve
it. You may need to go to the reading lab, for example.  You may need to meet
with me often, or meet with the Supplemental Instruction Leader.  Early in the
semester, begin to access what you need.  Courses like this are more difficult
than they seem because there are numerous new words and concepts. In order to
learn and succeed, you will have to (1) take good notes in class, (2) take
notes AS you read each chapter in the book, and (3) use the other university
services that you need (reading lab, writing lab). Also, arrange to study with
a "study buddy"\-- someone from the class who wants to make the same sort of
grade you want to make (matching by motivation is a good idea).  You also
should (1) buy a _study calendar_ , (2) schedule your reading (being
realistic), and (3) stick to your plan. Let me know if you are not doing as
well as you would like to do, and I will help you devise a plan to do better.
Do not let the semester "get away" from you!  This semester, we have a
supplemental instruction leader, Tracey Wyatt.  She will meet with you after
class, and help you learn more about the course at deeper levels.  We are
hoping that will make a difference!  **If you make a D or an F on any exam** ,
please make an appointment with me  so you can make a _more workable plan_ for
doing better.   I enjoy helping you.  Please come by...  
  
Attendance |

Due to the fact that students' grades are much higher if they attend class, I
will regularly take attendance. You will be given a score that is based on 100
points minus 3 points for each class missed (there are 28 classes). This score
will be 5% of your final grade and is intended to give your grade a little
"boost" (and it often has in the past!). This system does not require you to
come, but it does help you if you choose to come more often.  
Office Visit | During the first 3 weeks of class, please drop by my office for
a "get acquainted visit."  I would like to find out what your interests and
plans are.  This visit will count as 3 extra credit bonus points on your first
exam!  Bring your "About Me" form and we will discuss it.

Course Goals |

1\. Develop an understanding for what the field of psychology represents.  
  
2\. Learn a new vocabulary associated with psychology--become "literate" in
psychology by reading well-written college-level material.  
  
3\. Realize that the psychologists you read will have developed particular
perspectives on human thinking and behavior, and those perspectives are based
on research.  
  
4\. Begin developing your _own perspective_ with regards to how individuals
and other organisms come to think and behave.   Shifts in your perspectives
should come from your readings and class discussions.  
  
5\. Learn to "read-with-questions" \-- to read critically and question beneath
the level of the "text."  
  
6\. Set goals that are reasonable, and meet them (all of us!).  
  
7\. Find something special and personally meaningful in the course this
semester.  
  
8\. Enjoy the "highs" of learning, and be glad that the semester ends! (lots
of hard work...need a rest).

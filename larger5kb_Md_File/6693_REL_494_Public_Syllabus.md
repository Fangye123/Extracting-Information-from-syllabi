**Course Description:**

**Cities, Kingdoms and Empires** is the topic of this semester's class.  We
will use innovative virtual modelling projects as a way of exploring the
construction and meaning of spaces, places and activities in the remote past
in the Ancient Near East and Mediterranean. This class features a  research
project that is a collaborative class effort to create a virtual version of a
palace or temple or ancient neighborhood in a capital city.  Each student will
focus on one aspect or area of the city or kingdom.  **_Every student will
receive training in the virtual modelling software tools necessary to complete
the project,   beginning during the first week of class and continuing through
the semester._**

REL 494 provides an introduction to the study of archaeology and excavated
artifacts from the Ancient Near East with special reference to the lands of
the Bible (Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Turkey, Syria, Iraq, Iran,
Libya, Greece, Rome).  Through a combination of lectures, discussions, and a
virtual research project students gain an understanding of major
archaeological discoveries, excavation methods,  and the history, religion,
art and geography of the Ancient Near East.  This class explores how
archaeology and textual (including biblical) history dialogue with each other
as independent sources that have been used to illustrate, amplify and adjust
readings of the ancient past.

We work with the objects in the Archaeology Research Collection to learn the
characteristics of objects from various ancient places and times; we repair
and conserve ancient objects;  we work on research for the class presentation.
There will be two field trips during the semester.  This course is the second
of a two-part series, along with REL 394 (Near Eastern and Mediterranean
Archaeology) given in the Fall semester.  Between the two courses the history
of the Ancient Near East from the Stone Age to the Roman period will be
covered.  Students may take the courses in any order.

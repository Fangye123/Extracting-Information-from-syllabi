The following provides a basic outline of topics, required and recommended
readings, and class assignments and format. More detailed listings of primary
and secondary works, and guides to library resources, are contained in
supplementary Bibliographies, copies of which are on the "Classes" fileserver
as well as the WWW (see URLs below) The latter should be consulted throughout
the term in connection with in-class reports, and for the term paper. For
History majors, the term paper fulfills the *starred course requirement.  
  
The weekly readings are listed under PRIM. and SEC.You are expected to read
all of these, and as many of the others as you wish, especially in connection
with class reports. Both sets of readings are on GENERAL RESERVE in separate
**Binders** labelled "Primary" and "Secondary" under History 44. Books from
which one or two chapters are assigned are on General Reserve. The required
reading should be considered a minimum to be supplemented with some additional
reading for the in-class reports (see below). Recommended readings (REC.)
include selected "classic" studies and some samples of the most recent work in
the period.  
  
Class meetings will typically combine a brief introductory presentation, a
student report on the general readings and/or one or more _brief_ reports by
members of the class on a special topic as listed. The formal work of the
course consists of (1) _three_ in class reports (3 pp. single spaced maximum),
one of which should be a discussion of the historiographical issues raised in
the required secondary readings for the week or any one supplementary reading.
These reports must be spaced throughout the term as follows: weeks 1-4, 5-8;
and 9-13.; (2) a term paper (18-20 pp. double spaced maximum), and (3) a final
examination. CLASS ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION ARE IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THE
COURSE. MORE THAN ONE UNEXCUSED ABSENCE WILL RESULT IN A LOWERING OF THE GRADE
BY ONE LEVEL FOR EACH UNEXCUSED ABSENCE.  
  
_Books to Purchase_. The following required readings should be purchased by
each member of the class, and have been ordered for the bookstore.  
  
*John M. Cooper, _The Warrior and the Priest_  
*Ellen Fitzpatrick, ed. _Muckraking_  
*Upton Sinclair. _The Jungle_  
*Kathy Peiss, _Cheap Amusements_  
*Ruth Rosen, _The Lost Sisterhood_  
  
The two volumes of the "New American Nation Series" for the period will be
useful for students who have little background, and for general reference:
George Mowry, _The Era of Theodore Roosevelt_ ; and Arthur Link, _Woodrow
Wilson and the Progressive Era,_ located on the "American History" Honors
reserve shelf . Two recent surveys are John M. Cooper, _Pivotal Decades
1900-1920_ (1990) and John Whiteclay Chambers, _The tyranny of change :
America in the Progressive Era, 1900-1917_ (2nd edition), both on General
Reserve. Two excellent bibliographies for the period are John D. Buenker et
al., eds. _Progressive Reform_ (1980) [Ref. Z1242.8.B84]; and Louis Filler,
ed. , _Progressivism and Muckraking_ (1976) [Ref. Z7164.S66.F54]. For
biography and reference see John D. Buenker and Edward R.Kantowicz, eds.
_Historical Dictionary of the Progressive Era 1890-1930_ (Greenwood Press,
1988) [Reference]. A version of this syllabus with bibliographies for weekly
papers may be accessed on the World Wide Web with Netscape at

**A Note on Organization of the Syllabus/Course**  
  
The syllabus is organized to correspond roughly with successive stages within
the "progressive era," whether conceived in terms of the "three languages" of
progressivism (Rodgers), shifting political coalitions (Thelen, Buenker), or
emerging differences over "life style" issues that make it difficult or
impossible to speak of a "progressive movement" at all (Filene). Thematically,
the three major sections are: (1) politics and efforts to regulate the economy
in which the language of "antitrust" dominated [weeks 2-4], focusing on the
background and presidencies of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson; (2) the
transformation of the social order, with implications for "community" among
both the middle and working classes [weeks 5-6]; and (3) efforts to impose a
middle class order in the name of "efficiency" and "social control" during the
later part of the era, along with the responses of groups most directly
affected (laborers, African-Americans, immigrants, women) [weeks 6-12]. A
final two weeks considert he impact of World War I on the progressive agenda,
and the legacy for post-1918 liberalism.  
  
Cutting across this three-fold organization are several major themes that are
basic to an understanding of the period: (1)
bureaucratization/professionalization; (2) secularization as related to the
disruption of traditional community; and (3) shifting definitions of gender.
Not coincidentally, these themes also concerned seminal thinkers of the
period, both in Europe and in the United States. Chief among the Europeans
were Max Weber (bureaucratization) Emil Durkheim (secularization) , and
Sigmund Freud (sex and gender). Their theories, in turn, opposed or
supplemented an earlier tradition of class and economic analysis stemming from
the work of Karl Marx and his disciples. The resulting debates echo through
much of the historical literature of progressivism. Students interested in key
writings may wish especially to consult, Weber, "The Essentials of
Bureaucratic Organization: An Ideal-Type Construction" and Durkheim,
"Concerning the definition of religious phenomena." (For Freud's most direct
contribution to psychohistory see William C. Bullitt and Freud, _Thomas
Woodrow Wilson_ (1967).  
  
Although the approach is on competing "languages," conflicting interests, and
shifting coalitions rather than the definition of a single "progressive mind"
or "ethos" (as, for example in Hofstadter, Crunden), limits exclude certain
individuals, movements, and social/economic developments which were part of
America history from the late 1890s through 1920. "Progressive" is limited to
those individuals who thought of themselves or were thought by others under
this rubric. The primary cast of characters thus includes individuals from the
two generations born from the late 1850s to the late 1880s, but not their
intellectual mentors of the "generation of 1840" (Lester Ward, O.W. Holmes,
William James, e.g.) or a younger group of radicals and bohemians who caused a
stir in several major cities on the eve of the First Word War. Important
cultural developments, usually considered under the term "modernism," are
likewise excluded, whether in philosophy and social thought (the impact of
Nietzsche or Freud, for example) or art (the New York Armory Show of 1913).
Changes in the international power balance and foreign relations are also
omitted, except for final consideration of the impact of World War I on the
home front. A complete history of the period would reveal how these
individuals, movements, and underlying changes were underlining the
progressive effort to reshape America in the very years when it appeared to be
most successful.

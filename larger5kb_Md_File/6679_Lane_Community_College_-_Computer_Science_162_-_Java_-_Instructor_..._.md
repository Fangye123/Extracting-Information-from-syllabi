**Course:** **Computer Science II**  
**Course Number: CS 162**  
**Credits:** **       4**  
**Instructor:** **Jerry Ross**  
**Office Hours:** **Monday, Wednesday 12:00-3:00 pm** or by appointment. My
office is in Math and Art 233. You may leave a voice mail message for me in
the CIT department at extension 5827, or leave me an e-mail message at
rossj@lanecc.edu.

**Text1:** _**Java Software Solution**_ by Lewis and Loftus

**Text2:** _ **The Object Oriented Approach**_ by Satzinger and Orvik

**Course Description:** This course is the second in the Introduction to
Computer Science sequence. This course provides students with an introduction
to problem solving using the Java language. Students will learn elements of
software engineering from an object-oriented perspective.

The course involves study of online notes and lectures, programming
assignments, online quizzes, and a term programming project.

This course examines "Computer Science Level II concepts" utilizing the Java
language as the primary means of study.  Students will learn basic Java syntax
and its library structure as well as master concepts regarding object-oriented
modeling and problem solving..  In addition students will gain experience
utilizing an interactive development environment (IDE) for Java.  We will be
using, for the most part, TextPad or Forte Community Edition in conjunction
with the Java Development Kit (SDK).

The intention is for you to be able to work both independently and
collaboratively creating Java programs that require use of object-think style
problem solving, analysis, and design methods

Students will be learning the following topics

**Additional Recommended (but not required) Texts:**

_**[Java How to Program](alttext1.htm)**_ by Deitel  & Deitel

_**[Advanced Java2 Platform: How to Program](alttext2.htm)**_[
](alttext2.htm)by Deitel & Deitel

**_Java Design Patterns A Tutorial_ by James W. Cooper**

Note: These texts will provide the more technical student with additional
resources concerning topics beyond the scope of this course. Extra credit is
available for those students who select chapters or assignments from these
texts and who then report back to me about their learning experience.

**COURSE POLICIES**

**ASSESSMENT AND GRADING:  **

**Course grade:** The final course grade will be determined by the following
(Tasks are the four assignment tasks mentioned above):

| **TASK1** | **Homework** | **25%**  
---|---|---  
**TASK2** | **Participation** | **25%**  
**TASK3** | **Quizzes** | **25%**  
**TASK4** | **Projects** | **25%**  
  
Participation includes handing labs in on time, participating in the online
conferencing, the number of email communications.  It also includes helping
other students, writing advanced programs, demonstrating dedication to
learning.

The informed and active involvement of each student in class discussion is
essential for a course of this kind.  One's physical presence in an online
course is provided by active use of the conferencing utility and by email sent
to the instructor.

Email assignments:  Your assignments are to handed in via email or posted to a
web page URL  known only to you and the instructor. No email "problems" (i.e.,
connection problems) will be accepted.  _It is up to you to check out your
email situation prior to starting class and if problems occur to use a public
access computer or computers in the PC lab to send me email._  

Grading scale:

**A+** | **96-100**  
---|---  
**A** |

**92-95**  
  
**A-** | **90-91**  
**B+** | **85-89**  
**B+** | **86-89**  
**B** | **82-85**  
**B-** | **80-81**  
**C+** | **76-79**  
**C** | **72-75**  
**C-** | **70-71**  
**D+** | **69**  
**D** | **66-68**  
**D-** | **65**  
**F** | **below 65**  
  

####  Course Policies

**Attendance:**   **Students are expected to logon to the course website
everyday except for unusual and unavoidable circumstances**. **  **

**Although the learning mode is asynchronous (you don't have to be logged in
at a particular time and day), being gone from the site for several days may
result in announcements that go unread, corrections not recorded, and
interaction with team members cut short.   In addition, your absence
diminishes the classroom experience for the rest of the students. **

**Obviously in an online section, one of the great advantages is that you do
not have to be in class at a particular time.  **

**Part of the orientation during the first week, is to send me email telling
me about yourself and why you have signed up for the online section...here you
can tell me if you will be out of town or unable to send email on a particular
date.**

**Late work:**   Any assignment (lab) turned in late will lose significant
points for being late.  I don't have time to track days of tardiness, so if
its past the due date expect a much lower grade, somewhat arbitrarily
assigned.

**Incompletes:**   A grade of Incomplete (I) is given onlyif students have
completed 75% of the coursework.  The student must request an Incomplete in
writing and must obtain my permission.  All uncompleted work must be completed
within the time limits I set.

**Academic honesty** :  Cheating and plagiarism will not be tolerated.  Any
student found to be engaged in either of these activities at any point in the
course will receive a failing grade for the entire course and may be subject
to further college sanctions.

**Return of course materials** :  If you wish to have an assignment or your
final exam returned to you after the end of term, please provide me with an
appropriately-sized self-addressed stamped envelope.  Otherwise, I will
discard your work within 2 weeks after end of the term.

**Rules of Discussion:**   The classroom should be a safe haven within which
individuals can discuss the widest possible range of topics without fearing
retribution, ridicule, or attack.  This is a computer science -programming
class and we probably will not get into very controversial issues here \--
nevertheless, in order for our discussions to happen with the correct decorum
we must assume that we are all persons of intelligence and good will who may
ultimately disagree, sometimes to a profound degree, with one another but
whose characters are not impugned or intelligence disparaged because of this
disagreement.

The classroom is not a forum for proselytizing, nor is it a soapbox for
diatribes by either students or faculty.  For the academic endeavor to
succeed, we must treat each other with civility, courtesy, and respect.  All
perspectives and questions are welcome, as long as they are impelled by
genuine desire for knowledge, can be articulated thoughtfully, and supported
with sound reasoning.

**Difficulties:** If you find you are having problems with the class -- the
labs, the attendance, keeping up with the reading, anything, please let me
know.   I'm always available to help you, but I have to know about the problem
while it's going on and before the end of the class.  The last week of class
is not the best time to ask for help.

**Students with disabilities** :  Students with documented disabilities who
may need accommodations, who have any emergency medical information the
instructor should know of, or who need special arrangements, should make an
appointment with the instructor as early as possible, no later than the first
week of the term.

###  Syllabus for Anth 415 Ecological Anthropology (Theory)

**ORIENTATION**

Ecological anthropology operates from the local to the global levels.



> 1) At the community level, ecological anthropology explores the role of
culture in the adaptations and maladaptations of human populations as they
interact with their ecosystems in the diverse biomes of the planet.

>  
> 2) At the global level, ecological anthropology also examines trends in the
evolution of human-environment interactions and impacts from prehistory to the
present.

>  
> Accordingly, by examining the different niches of specific cultures in
particular as well as the changing human niche in general, ecological
anthropology simultaneously explores alternative scenarios for a more
sustainable future; that is, the possibilities of greener societies which
would promote the adaptability of the human species.

>  

This semester the course surveys the history, theory, methods, and data of a
diversity of approaches to ecological anthropology, including:



1) the decisive role of culture in mediating the interaction between human
populations and the ecosystems in their habitat;

     
2) how people manipulate and transform their natural environments;

     
3) environmental problems, issues, and discourses from various perspectives of
sociocultural anthropology and in relation to human rights; and,

     
4) the mutual relevance of anthropology and the green movement.

**GOALS**

The course is devoted to five primary goals:



> 1) to provide a general introductory survey of ecological anthropology,
including the diversity of approaches to human ecology and adaptive processes,
and familiarity with basic reference sources;

>  
> 2) to demonstrate the pivotal importance of culture in human ecology,
adaptations, maladaptations, and environmental concerns;

>  
> 3) to critically analyze selected key problems, issues, and approaches to
human ecology and environmental concerns;

>  
> 4) to examine the mutual relevance of orthodox and unorthodox approaches to
human ecology and environmentalism as one way to better understand the
contributions and limitations of ecological anthropology and as one way to
transcend some of its limitations;

>  
> 5) to demonstrate the mutual relevance of ecological anthropology
environmental concerns, and human rights.

>  

**FORMAT**

The class format includes:

1) a series of lectures drawn from chapters in the instructor's book
manuscript (see below);

2) open class and group discussions of the required texts;

3) student panel discussions of case studies prefaced by a one page typed
summary distributed in the prior class meeting;

4) slides from the instructor's fieldwork in the Venezuelan Amazon, southern
Thailand, and northern New Mexico; and

5) selected videos.



**GRADE**

 The course grade will be based on:

1) regular quizzes (60%);

2) panel discussions (30%); and

3) student attendance and participation (10%).

     
Quizzes may be announced or surprise, objective or essay, and taken in class
or prepared at home. Extra credit can be earned through video reaction papers,
book reports, and research papers (library or field). Alternative learning
procedures and grading criteria for individual students may be considered. For
example, an individual may wish to concentrate his/her efforts in the course
on pursuing the alternative of research on the ecological anthropology of a
particular culture (e.g., Shoshoni), biome (e.g., temperate desert), and/or
anthropologist (e.g., Julian Steward).

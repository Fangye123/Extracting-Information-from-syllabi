**Undergraduate Course Description and Requirements**

Historians refer to the period from 1865 through 1920 as the Gilded Age and
Progressive Era. Whatever it is labeled, the post-reconstruction period
(1877-1920) resulted in dramatic social, cultural, economic, and political
transformations that moved the United States from a mostly agricultural and
rural nation to a more industrialized and urban world power. The changes
involved a new role for national, state, and local governments, as well as an
expanded influence for the United States in world affairs. The period
witnessed the creation of great wealth and an expanding middle class
juxtaposed along side a growing recognition of poverty in an industrializing
America. Americans settled "the last west" and ended traditional American
Indian lifestyles. The rapid introduction of new technologies changed
circumstances surrounding work and everyday life. Newly defined gender roles
reshaped family, childhood, and adolescence. These years also witnessed the
development of dejure and defacto racial segregation in the post-slavery era.
The burgeoning levels of immigration during this period literally remade the
"face" of American society.

Of course, I expect students enrolled in this course to uphold the [UMBC Code
of Student Conduct for Academic
Integrity](http://www.umbc.edu/NewsEvents/Student/stconduct.html). In Spring,
2002 the UMBC Faculty Senate adopted the following statement emphasizing the
importance of academic integrity for faculty and students:

By enrolling in this course, each student assumes the responsibilities of an
active participant in UMBC's scholarly community in which everyone's academic
work and behavior are held to the highest standards of honesty. Cheating,
fabrication, plagiarism, and helping others to commit these acts are all forms
of academic dishonesty, and they are wrong. Academic misconduct could result
in disciplinary action that may include, but is not limited to, suspension or
dismissal. To read the full Student Academic Conduct Policy, consult the UMBC
Student Handbook, the Faculty Handbook, or the UMBC Policies section of the
UMBC Directory.

**On-Line Syllabus**

  * **This course has a web-based syllabus that utilizes the UMBC Blackboard software. Your first assignment is to enroll for this course through the UMBC Blackboard website located at:[ http://blackboard.umbc.edu](http://blackboard.umbc.edu/).  There are detailed instructions for logging into Blackboard and enrolling in this course on this site.**
  * **I suggest that you go to a[campus computer lab](http://www.umbc.edu/oit/classroomtechnology/labs/index.html) the first time you enroll in a Blackboard course. Helpdesk personnel can assist with any questions or problems you might encounter. **
  * **The UMBC Office of Instructional Technology maintains a helpdesk at 410-455-3838 (ECS 20) and has a good website at:<http://www.umbc.edu/oit/>.**
  * **Again, you must enroll immediately so that you can complete the first assignment. Being enrolled in this course with the registrar's office does not enroll you in the Blackboard course. You must do this through the[ Blackboard](http://blackboard.umbc.edu/) website.**

**Required Texts**

All **undergraduate** students are _required_ to purchase the following texts
for this course:

1) Stacy Cordery. _Theodore Roosevelt: In the Vanguard of the Modern._
Wadsworth Publishing pbk. 2002.  
2) Leon Fink. _Major Problems in the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era._
Houghton Mifflin, 2001. pbk.  
3) Vera Brittain. _Testament of Youth: An Autobiographical Study of the Years
1900-1925._ Penguin USA. pbk.  
4) Ballard Campbell. _The Human Tradition in the Gilded Age and Progressive
Era._ Scholarly Resources, 2000. pbk.

You will also need to use assigned readings available on the Internet and
linked to the Blackboard syllabus. Campus computer labs are a good place to
access the course website. You also have access from any computer connected to
the Internet. Be sure to pick up the UMBC Internet CD 2003 from the OIT
helpdesk (ECS 20). This free CD includes a variety of software programs that
will help you take full advantage of resources and services at UMBC. In
addition, UMBC has a contract with Microsoft that allows the campus book store
to offer students software at _very_ low prices. You may also borrow Microsoft
software CDs from the UMBC library. For more information about purchasing
software at the low contract prices see: [

**Requirements:**

  * **Discussion Board Written Evaluations of Assigned Readings.** (100 points, plus 10 possible extra credit points) Each week students are required to participate in an on-line discussion of assigned readings. You will be assigned to one of three discussion groups.  **I will provide questions each week to get the discussion started. You should post your thoughts about the readings to your assigned Blackboard Discussion Board Group by noon on Thursday of each week**. This is the place to discuss the major arguments presented in the reading assignments before coming to class. The readings are based on the required texts and Internet assignments. Each week's Discussion Board evaluation is worth up to **10 points**. There are 13 weeks with assigned readings. You may earn up to 10 extra credit points in this category.  


  * **Research Paper.**

    * **Research Paper:** (100 points) All undergraduate students enrolled in this course are required to write an 8-10 page research paper on an approved topic. You are not limited to the suggested topics, but this list should give you some idea what I am looking for.  Submit your topic choice and proposed bibliography (3 books or the equivalent in articles plus a collection of primary sources that will inform your essay) to me via email [ (lindenme@umbc.edu](mailto:\(lindenme@umbc.edu)) by September 24th. Final papers are due by the start of class on December 5th. Late submissions will suffer a 10 point per day deduction. Be sure to follow the **[formal paper guidelines](http://www.research.umbc.edu/~lindenme/hist441/ugradguidelines.htm)** posted under the Assignment section of this website.  


  * **Examinations.** (Midterm, 100 points; Final, 100 points = 200 points). The midterm and final examinations will cover lecture and assigned reading materials to date, however the final is _not_ comprehensive. Both will be essay format and completed during scheduled class time.   


  * ***Make-up Policy** **: I will offer make-up examinations for the midterm and the final examination, but only if arrangements for a make-up are made the day the examination is scheduled or before. If you miss the midterm or final and have not notified me in advance, you may** ** _not_** **take a makeup and will earn 0 points for the missed exam. Warning: I am strict about this policy.**

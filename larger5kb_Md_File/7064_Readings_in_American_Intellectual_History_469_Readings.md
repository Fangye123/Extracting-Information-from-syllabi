**I. THE EMERGENCE OF DARWIN'S THEORY**

What were the logic and history of Darwin's discovery? Was the new theory
inspired by new facts? How did Darwin rise above the antecedents and
influences that had shaped him? At what point did the pupil transcend his
masters and the past give way to the future? Was Darwin a real revolutionary,
and, if so, what was the nature of his revolution?

II. THE CONTROVERSY OVER EVOLUTION IN AMERICA**

Who were the proponents and dissenters of Darwin's ideas in America? Using
Thomas Kuhn's _Structure of Scientific Revolutions_ , how would you explain
the contending roles of Agassiz and Gray? How did American scientists prefer
to interpret Darwin's theory?

did it take the Fundamentalists so long to react to Darwin?

IV. SOCIAL ETHICS**

Many intellectuals in America translated the language of evolution into social
and ethical theory, and the most common way of describing the result is
"social Darwinism." The implication of the phrase is usually that Americans
seized on Darwinism in order to create a dominant "cult of individualism" as a
rationale for laissez faire capitalism. Do you agree or disagree, and why?

**V. BEGINNINGS OF POLITICAL CRITICISM**

For many thoughtful Americans the welter of frontier individualism was a
severe trial to their faith in American institutions. An ambitious
industrialism colliding with a shambling Jacksonian democracy was forecasting
consequences to government and to society that intelligent men and women could
not shut their eyes to. To deal with the problems facing them, most American
critics were singularly ill equipped. What were the problems that pressed for
solution?

**VI. THE SOCIAL CRITICS**

For two and a half centuries, the pattern of life woven by the scattering of
men and women along a wide frontier had transformed America into a society
that was decentralized, individualistic, and democratic. Then had come the
Industrial Revolution that in creating great cities and in drawing people from
the plow to the machine was to undo in a few brief years the long work of the
dispersion, repudiate the ideals of the Enlightenment, and provide a new
pattern for a consolidating urban society. What new forces were at work? How
did they affect the individual? How did Darwin's ideas fit this new paradigm
of forces?

**VIII. THE BACKWASH OF THE FRONTIER**

The marrow of Americanism is not the same substance from generation to
generation. Was Mark Twain an embodiment of a frontier past or of the future?
Was he the last authentic American--a native writer thinking his own thoughts,
using his own eyes, speaking his own dialect, with everything European fallen
away? Is he a changing reflection of American society that speaks to its hopes
and contradictions?

**IX. THE QUEST FOR UTOPIA**

The approach of the new century inspired a flood of books that reflected on
problems of the nineteenth and the possibilities of the twentieth. Who were
these writers? Were they optimistic or pessimistic? Is there a particular
reason why they chose the written word to express their thoughts? What were
the alternatives to their utopias? Who were their counterparts in Europe?

**X. SUBJECT OF RACE**

The concept of racial inferiority was beyond critical reach in the nineteenth
century. Anthropology, medicine, psychology, and sociology became the
instruments which  "verified" theories of race extinction and helped to
rationalize the politics of disfranchisement and segregation. Did dissent
about the character of evolution have any bearing on the concept of racial
inferiority?

At the time when Darwin was still hesitantly outlining his theory in private,
racial destiny had already been called upon by American Expansionists to
support the conquest of Mexico. Did Anglo-Saxonism, which for a time had a
particularly powerful grip on Americans, depend upon Darwinism either for its
inception or for its development? Was Darwinism put in the service of the
imperial urge? If so, how? Was it also a tool of the anti-imperialists? If so,
how?

**XII. GOVERNING PHILOSOPHIES**

The modern habit of expecting an authoritative reply from science on almost
any subject where hard data can be found dates from Darwin. The scientific
method, as we have come to believe, cannot be walled off into a few safe
areas; wherever empirical evidence exists, there the method of science
belongs. No future paradigm explaining our thought processes is likely to
endanger the primacy of the scientific method in western culture. Do you agree
or disagree? Explain.

**XIII. THE THIRD CULTURE**

In 1963, C.P. Snow, in a now famous essay, wrote about the polarization of the
"two cultures"\--literary intellectuals on the one hand, and scientists on the
other. Although he hoped for the emergence of a "third culture" that would
bridge the gap, it is only recently- books such as Daniel C. Dennett's
_Consciousness Explained_ , Stephen Jay Gould's _Wonderful Life_ , Stephen
Hawking's _A Brief History of Time_ , Roger Penrose's _The Emperor's New Mind_
, and Stephen Pinker's _The Language Instinct_ became bestsellers--that
science has changed the intellectual landscape. Now it is scientists, not
literary intellectuals, who have the most to say on the important questions
facing mankind. Do you agree or disagree? What are the significant arguments
that make up this debate?

Darwin-L Web Server: Darwin-L@raven.cc.ukans.edu

This is an international network discussion group for academic professionals
in the historical sciences. Darwin-L was established in 1993 to promote the
reintegration of a range of fields all of which are concerned with
reconstructing the past from evidence in the present, and to encourage
communication among researchers in these fields. In spite of its name,
Darwin-L does not focus specifically on the work of Charles Darwin, but rather
covers the entire range of palaetiology from an explicitly comparative
perspective, including evolutionary biology, historical linguistics, textual
transmission and stemmatics, historical geology, systematics and phylogeny,
archeology, paleontology, historical geography, cosmology, and historical
anthropology. It is not an amateur chat-oriented forum, nor a forum for
discussion of creationism versus evolution. The site is administered by Dr.
Robert J. O'Hara, Department of Biology, University of North Carolina at
Greensboro, and Dr. Gregory C. Mayer, Department of Biological Sciences,
University of Wisconsin-Parkside, with the cooperation of the Department of
History and the Academic Computing Center of the University of Kansas.

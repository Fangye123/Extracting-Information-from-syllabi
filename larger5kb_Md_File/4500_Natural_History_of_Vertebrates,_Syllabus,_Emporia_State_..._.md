**I. course description:**  
  
     Natural History of Vertebrates Lab is a course designed for biology majors. The objective of the course is to provide an in- depth study of the vertebrates. The lab will supplement the lecture course and focus on the habitat requirements, collection, and identification of vertebrates in Kansas.  
  
    Even though the lecture course (ZO 556) is a separate course from lab (ZO 557), both courses support each other. You can not take one course without the other, that is you must be concurrently enrolled in both courses. To this end you must pass the lecture to get a passing grade in lab, and you must pass the lab to get a passing grade in lecture. IF YOU FAIL EITHER COURSE, YOU MUST REPEAT BOTH COURSES.  
  
**II. pre-requisites:**  
  
     You must have completed biology of animals and lab (ZO 214/215) or its equivalent. This course will give you a basic understanding of animals and their evolution and organization. Natural History of Vertebrates will then build on this information.  
  
**III. course organization:**  
  
     Material will be presented primarily in the form of field trips, examination of specimens, and lectures. Lectures will introduce the specimens but you will be expected to know. It is up to you to determine the best way to identify the organisms presented in lab. You can not expect to pass Natural History of Vertebrates Lab without intensive study outside of lab (1-2 hours of study for every hour in class). The material presented in the latter part of the course will be based on material presented in the first part of the course, therefore you will have to commit the material to long term memory.  
  
**IV. grading:**  
  
     Your grade will be determined based upon the total points (725 points) earned on examinations, field notes, keys, paper reviews, and a collection. There is no provision for doing extra or outside work to improve your grade.  
  
    A  = 92.0% to 100%     A-  = 89.0% to 91.9%     B+  = 86.0% to 88.9%     B  = 83.0% to 85.9%     B-  = 79.0% to 82.9%     C+  = 76.0% to 78.9%     C  = 70.0% to 75.9%     D  = 60.0% to 69.9%     F < 60.0%  
  
**examinations:** Five tests are scheduled for the semester (see class
schedule). Because of the time involved in setting-up lab exams, the tests
will start at 8:00 and lecture will follow the lab exams. Each test is worth
80 points. This yields 400 possible points on the exams. Because of the time
involved in setting up lab exams, they can only be made-up in dire
circumstances, (I DECIDE IF THE SITUATION WAS DIRE ENOUGH). THE MAKE UP EXAM
WILL BE A COMPREHENSIVE EXAM TO BE GIVEN AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER.  
  
     Because of the time involved in setting-up the lab exams, the lab will be closed at 10:00 pm the night before the lab exams. In addition, the lab will be closed on various evenings as exams are set-up for Vertebrate Structure and Development. This means that you should make effective use of lab time. SH 46 is available for study from 6:30 am until 10:00 pm Monday through Friday, except when classes are meeting (see schedule on the bulletin board at the front of the room).  
  
**collection:** During the semester, you must make a collection of
vertebrates. This collection will consist of 6 organisms (2 fish, 2
amphibians, 2 reptiles)and 4 casts of tracks (2 birds and 2 mammals); all must
be different species and no domestic species are allowed. In addition, your
collection must be supported by field notes and a catalog.  
  
     Your grade will be determined based upon the quality of your specimens' preparation, the documentation of the specimens provided in your field notes, and your catalog of specimens. YOU MUST COLLECT YOUR OWN SPECIMENS. IF YOU ARE GIVEN EVEN ONE SPECIMEN BY ANYONE EITHER THROUGH PURCHASE, TRADE, OR GIFT, IT IS THE SAME AS HAVING SOMEONE WRITE YOUR TERM PAPER. IT IS CHEATING AND YOUR ENTIRE COLLECTION WILL BE WORTH ZERO. The total points possible on the field notes, catalog, and collection is 200 points.  
  
**field trips:** At different times during the semester, we will go on short
field trips during class. These trips will introduce you to methods for
collecting vertebrates and for recording observations in the form of field
notes. If you miss a class field trip there will be an automatic 10-point
deduction from your grade and they can not be made-up. In addition, there will
be a required weekend field trip to Quivira National Wildlife Refuge on 4 - 5
May 2002. If you miss the field trip to Quivira National Wildlife Refuge there
will be an automatic 50-point deduction from your grade and it can not be
made-up. All of these field trips must be described in your field notes,
regardless if you collect any specimens or not. All in-class field trips will
be announced in class at least one-class day before the field trip.  
  
**keys:** For each class of vertebrates that are studied in lab, you should
make a key to the specimens. It is generally better to work with a partner to
make the key. The keys will not be graded, however, in the past when students
have made keys to the specimens, they have done much better on the practical
exams.  
  
**paper reviews** : Five times during the semester, we will review a paper in
class. The day of the review, you must turn in a 1.5 to 2.0 page summary of
the paper. The summary is due at the beginning of class and can not be turned
in late. If you have to miss class for whatever reason, then you should turn
it in early or you can e-mail the summary to me by 5:00 PM on the due date and
I will still accept it. The text of your summary must be embedded in the
e-mail message. Do **NOT** send your summary as an attachment. When writing
the summary of the paper, be sure to include: the objectives of the study, the
methods used and the results of the research, and your reaction to the paper.
Your reaction may be positive or negative, but should address if the authors
met their objectives, the quality of the design of the research and the
applicability of the study to other organisms or situations. Each summary is
worth 25 points for a total of 125 points. The summary must be typed, double-
spaced with the title set-up exactly as for the term paper in lecture. When
writing the summary do not copy the abstract to the paper, this is plagiarism
and will get you a zero for your efforts. In addition, you can not write your
summary with a partner, it must be your own work. Be sure to review the
[Policies on Academic Dishonesty](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/dishbiol.htm)
of [Emporia State University](http://www.emporia.edu/) and the [Division of
Biological Sciences](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/biology.htm).  
  
**V. attendance:**  
  
     I will sometimes take attendance, even though I will not count lack of attendance against you, except for field trips. However, if you do not come to class, you will be unable to check if your understanding of the material is adequate. You should be committed enough to your education to come to class, otherwise you are just wasting your money.  
  
**VI. academic dishonesty:**  
  
     Plagiarism, which was mentioned above and is described in more detail in the ["Instructions for Review Papers in Natural History of Vertebrates"](revpaper.htm#plagiarism) will result in a zero on your review paper. In addition, any student who permits another student to use his/her work will get a zero on the assignment. Finally, any copying or other forms of cheating during a test will result in a zero on that exam. The Chair of the Division of Biological Sciences will be informed of all acts of academic dishonesty and the action taken against the offender. Be sure to review the [Policies on Academic Dishonesty](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/dishbiol.htm) of [Emporia State University](http://www.emporia.edu/) and the [Division of Biological Sciences](http://www.emporia.edu/biosci/biology.htm).  
  
**VII. home page:**  
  
     There is a home page for this course on ESU's World Wide Web server. There will be information on the server that will be useful to you during the course. I would strongly encourage you to take advantage of the home page during the course. The URL for the home page is <http://academic.emporia.edu/mooredwi/nathist/>.

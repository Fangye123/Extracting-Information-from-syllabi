Political Science 160, Sections 01 and 02  
Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00 - 11:15 and 11:30-12:45  
Mr. Glen Johnson, Instructor  
Fall, 1996

The purpose of this course is to provide a systematic introduction to the
political aspects of contemporary transnational relations.

**COURSE MATERIALS:**

The following books and materials should be purchased from the College Store:  

> * Michael T. Klare and Daniel C. Thomas (eds), _World Security: Challenges
for a New Century_ (second edition, 1994).  
>

> * Thomas D. Lairson and David Skidmore, _International Political Economy:
The Struggle for Power and Wealth_ (1993).  
>

> * Karen Mingst, _The Ivory Trade_ (1994).  
>

> * Joseph S. Nye, Jr., _Understanding International Conflicts: An
Introduction to Theory and History_ (1994).  
>

> * Political Science Department (eds), _Selected Readings in International
Politics_ (1996).

Some materials on reserve in the library will also be assigned. An electronic
version of the syllabus is available on-line at the URL
**http://faculty.vassar.edu/~johnsong/160_syllabus.html**. This version has
links to certain electronic reserve materials as well as important documents,
bibliographies, collections and other source materials relevant to the various
topics we will be considering during the course of the term. All required
reserve reading will be available in hard copy form but some of the other
linked materials will be available only or more easily in electronic form.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

The requirements for the course are:  

> * 1\. A full and thoughtful reading of all material assigned in this
syllabus plus a few short pieces that may be added from time to time;  
>

> * * 2\. Regular attendance along with active engagement and participation in
the work of the class;  
>

> * * 3\. Successful completion of a brief exercise designed to develop
familiarity with relevant resources in the library and on the Internet;  
>

> * * 4\. Successful completion of two written exercises -- the first one due
on Sept 26; the second one due on Nov 21 [detailed instructions will be
distributed later];  
>

> * * 5\. Successful completion of mid-term and final examinations.

For purposes of grading, the various course requirements will be assigned the
following weights:  

> Library/Internet exercise 5%  
>  Mid-term exam 15%  
>  First written exercise 15%  
>  Second written exercise 25%  
>  Final examination 30%  
>  Class participation 10%  
>

Please note that these percentages will not be applied mechanically. For
example, sustained improvement during the term may be rewarded by giving more
weight to stronger performances later in the term. On the other hand, failure
to complete any single requirement of the course in an acceptable and timely
fashion will be considered sufficient grounds to justify failure in the
course.

You know from today the dates on which the written assignments will be due and
the date of the mid-term examination. Please plan your work accordingly. Only
documented illness or serious family emergency will be considered acceptable
grounds for even brief extensions.

**SOME NOTES ON SOURCES**

Electronic sources are becoming increasingly important in many fields,
including international politics. You will want to become familiar with many
of these sources and their uses. The [Vassar College
Libraries](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/index.html) provide a number of links
which will be helpful to the experienced user of electronic source materials
as well as the novice. You will find the Library's [Electronic Text
Center](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/index.html) useful in a
variety of ways. The following lists of electronic resources will be of
particular importance in connection with this course:  

> [International
Studies](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/acad/intstud.html)  
>  [United Nations and
NGOs](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/gov/un.html)  
>  [Human
Rights](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/misc/human.html)  
>  [Africana
Studies](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/africana/africana_studies.html)  
>  [Asian
Studies](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/acad/asian.html)  
>  [Latin American
Studies](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/electronics/etc/acad/latin.html)

A selected list of relevant Websites outside the College may be consulted by
clicking [here](http://faculty.vassar.edu/~johnsong/160linkslist.html).

The texts required for this course contain useful bibliographies of more
traditional printed materials of relevance to the field.

While this is not a current events course, current materials will be used to
illustrate a variety of points and are likely to become an object of
discussion on occasion. Therefore, students are expected to keep themselves
well informed by reading at least one good daily newspaper and a news magazine
as well as one or more good journals of opinion. In this part of the country
[The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com) often serves as a common source
of current news and a basis for discussion. Most of you will want to read it
daily either in hard copy form or on-line at http://www.nytimes.com.

One of the purposes of this course is to help you to broaden your perspective
on international affairs, to understand more fully the views and perspectives
of others. To this end you will want to read fairly regularly in newspapers
from other countries. Some of these are available in hard copy in the library
and we have provided links to dailies from around the world in the list of
Websites available by clicking
[here](http://faculty.vassar.edu/~johnsong/160linkslist.html).

When you use materials in research, you will want to give proper credit
through appropriate citation. The Web is so new that there is no standard form
of citation. However, there are several citation guides available. Probably
the best one for you to use is the guide to [Citing Electronic
Information](http://iberia.vassar.edu/vcl/Quick-Guides/electcit.html) prepared
by the Vassar Library Staff. A more comprehensive source is [Li and Crane,
Bibliographic Formats for Citing Electronic
Information](http://www.uvm.edu/~xli/reference/estyles.html). For materials in
printed form, the best brief guide to citation formats is Kate Turabian, A
Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press), which is available in the College Store.

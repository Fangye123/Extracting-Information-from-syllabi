**HISTORY 1088: The Mediterranean World, 336-31 BCE**

** **

**Catalog Number** : 1619

**Instructor** : Christopher P. Jones (e-mail: cjones@fas; office 226
Boylston, 2-4 Wednesdays)

**Time and place of course** : MW(F) 10, Sever 202

This course follows the history of the Mediterranean from the reign of
Alexander the Great to the battle of Actium. The phases include the
establishment of the Successor Kingdoms after Alexander's death, and their
gradual decline under internal and external pressures; the interaction between
the growing power of Rome and other Mediterranean states, especially Carthage;
and the transformation of the Mediterranean into a Roman lake in the last two
centuries BCE. There will be lectures on Mondays and Wednesdays, and the
sections on Fridays will focus on issues of particular interest and on the
accounts given by ancient (Greek and Latin) authors. No knowledge of ancient
languages is required; some knowledge of Greek and/or Roman history is an
advantage, but is not required. Students will be expected to consult e-mail
frequently and to use the WWW.

This course will examine the political and social transformations and cultural
developments that conspired to make the kingdom of France one of the most
influential and dynamic polities in the medieval world. Among the topics to be
addressed: the ideals and practice of kingship; the formation of "French"
national identity; France as a center of European intellectual and cultural
life; forms of religious life, dissent, and persecution (monastic movements,
the Albigensian Crusade, treatment of the Jews, and Trial of the Templars);
and the ideals and realities of social relations (courtly romance; the rise of
the merchant class; the status of women). In pursuing these topics, we shall
work with a variety of primary source materials (in translation) ranging from
history and royal biography to letters and treatises to images and music.

**_The Written Word_ **  
**_Weekly Primary Source Analyses_**  
  
The weekly primary source analysis requires you to a) select a passage that
you find significant, revealing,puzzling, or problematic; b) transcribe this
passage (the selected passage should be a half page or less single spaced; c)
explain as fully but also as succinctly as possible what you find interesting,
puzzling, etc. about the passage and its possible historical implications,
significance, and/or connections. References to the source may be done as
follows (p.9) if the source is clear; otherwise, (Abelard, _Ethics_ , p. 9)  
  
**_Essays_**  
  
Papers should be submitted by the specified day and time and may be turned in
at the History Dept, my office, or my home (109 Winona). Submissions via email
attachment are also acceptable but you bear full responsibility for making
sure that the paper you wrote is the one I receive (e.g.,, if there aren't
footnotes in the one I read, they don't exist as far asI am concerned and I'll
comment and grade accordingly). Please send your file in Word or Wordperfect
(.pdf is also acceptable). I am happy to do test runs for those who want to
pursue this option but have anxieties.  
  

  * **_Midterm Essay_ ** (5-7 pages)     _Due by 5 pm on January 25_  
  
This essay will address a question/problem/thesis posed by me in terms of a
specific text or set of texts.  
  

  * **_Final Essay_** (10-12 pages)      _Due by 5 pm March 1_  
  
Topics for this essay will either address change and continuity over the
timespan of the course or ask for an in depth analysis of a problem in the
context of a single source; students will be responsible for selecting the
primary source(s) on which they base their argument and their specific
approach to the topic.

**_Map/Geography Quiz_**     _January 11 (in class)_  
**_Modified Take Home Exam_**     _Due by 6 pm on March 16_  
  
This exam will consist of two to four questions from which you will choose one
to answer. It is called "modified" because, in contrast to many take home
exams, which do not restrict the time during which you write the exam, this
one does - on the honor system. Basically the deal is this: you have the final
questions in advance and can prepare as much as you wish: gathering evidence
and arguments from primary sources and secondary materials; outlining your
response; even discussing the questions with your colleagues. When you get
ready to write the exam, however, you are allowed (again on the honor system)
only a single sheet with an outline (remember that sheets of paper have two
sides) and an unlimited number of pages of quotations or paraphrases from
primary sources/secondary works (the former should greatly predominate); this
evidence should be properly annotated. Go to the place you work best and write
for no more than 3 hours. Hand in the exam (handwritten or typed) along with
all the materials that you used.

**_Some Fine Print on Grading_**  
(borrowed with minor adaptation from Princeton University's History
Department: http://www.princeton.edu/~history/)  
  

The following represents a succinct articulation of my general approach to
grading the various kinds of work that you will submit over the course of the
term. You will note that nowhere does it mention "getting the right answer";
please take the larger meaning of this absence seriously. For me, the ultimate
quality of written assignments and oral comments depends not on their
proximity to a predetermined "answer" but on the imagination, knowledge of the
materials, and rhetorical and logical presentation of the argument. Some of
the best essays and comments in class may well be ones with which I,
personally, disagree wholeheartedly; I may even attempt to refute them in my
comments. But a good argument is a good argument, and an insightful and
rigorous interpretation of the sources that raises fruitful questions is the
essence of historical thought and writing. Finally, improvement over the term
will be noted.

**In-Class Discussion (similar standards apply to caucus discussion)**

  * A student who receives an **A** for participation in discussion in class usually comes to every class with questions about the readings already in mind. An 'A' discussant engages others about ideas, respects the opinions of others, and consistently elevates or advances the discussion. 
  * A student who receives a **B** for participation in discussion in class does not come to each class with questions about the readings in mind. A 'B' discussant waits passively for others to raise interesting issues. Some discussants in this category, while courteous and articulate, do not adequately listen to other participants or relate their comments to the direction of the conversation. 
  * A student who receives a **C** for discussion in class regularly but typically is an infrequent or unwilling participant in discussion.

**N.B.** Attendance is mandatory. One unexcused absence will therefore result
in a drop of _one full letter_ grade in class participation; two unexcused
absences will result in a drop of **an additional two full letter grades** in
class participation; three will result in a letter grade of **F** for class
participation. The message is simple: if you are or have been forced for
legitimate reasons to miss a class, let me know immediately and we can make
alternative arrangements.  
  
**Weekly Primary Source Responses** ++ |  Interesting primary source
selection; creative, insightful close analysis/interpretation; well-organized
and articulate presentation.  
---|---  
+ | Same criteria as above but analysis is not as full as the text deserved or presentation flawed.  
check mark | Satisfactory interpretation, good passage but does not go much
beyond description; does not explain interpretation with sufficient clarity;
writing problems  
0 | Unacceptable assignment (a summary of a text; extensive writing problems;
not based primarily on a specific passage but on the primary source in
general). One such assignment may be redone for a new grade.  
  

**Papers and Exams** (Late Papers w/o prior consultation will be automatically
graded down one letter grade)

  * An A or A- paper or exam is clearly written and well-organized. It demonstrates that the writer has conducted a close and critical reading of texts, grappled with the issues raised in the course, synthesized the readings, discussions, and lectures, and formulated a perceptive, compelling, independent argument. The argument shows intellectual originality and creativity and is supported by a well-chosen and fairly interpreted examples from the primary sources. 

  * A B+ or B paper or exam demonstrates many aspects of A-level work but falls short of it in either the organization and clarity of its writing, the formulation and presentation of its argument, or the quality of research. Some papers or exams in this category are solid works containing flashes of insight into many of the issues raised in the course. Others give evidence of independent thought, but the argument is not presented clearly or convincingly.

  * A B- paper or exam demonstrates a knowledge of the course material but shows weaknesses in writing, argument, organization, or use/interpretation of evidence. 

  * A C+, C, or C- paper or exam offers little more than a mere a summary of ideas and information, does not respond to the assignment adequately, suffers from frequent factual errors, unclear writing, poor organization, or inadequate primary research, or presents some combination of these problems. 

Whereas the grading standards for written work between A and C- are concerned
with the presentation of argument and evidence, a paper or exam that belongs
to the D or F categories demonstrates inadequate command of course material.

  * A D paper or exam demonstrates serious deficiencies or flaws in the student's command of course or research material. 

  * An F paper or exam demonstrates no competence in the course or research materials. It indicates a student's neglect or lack of effort in the course.

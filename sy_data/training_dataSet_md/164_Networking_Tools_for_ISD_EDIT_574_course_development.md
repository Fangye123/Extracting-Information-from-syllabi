**_Methodology:_**

This two credit hour course is designed to assist students in exploring and
developing expertise with the various aspects of using computer networking
tools and developing ways in which these tools can be integrated into the
instructional design process. Synchronous and asynchronous discussions, on-
line resources, and hands-on activities will be utilized in order to help
students develop a working knowledge of computer networking.

**_Course Objectives_**

As a result of this course, participants will be able to:

  * develop general knowledge of networking operating systems
  * develop general knowledge of networking hardware components
  * trouble shoot typical network problems associated with publishing and managing network instruction
  * articulate what networking processes are relevant to the instructional design process
  * communicate using synchronous and asynchronous telecommunications
  * share network resources
  * demonstrate basic web-site administration

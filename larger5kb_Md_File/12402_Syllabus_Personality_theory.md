**Course....... Objective:** |

The purpose of the course is to introduce the student to the dominant
approaches  to the study of personality. Each theories will be presented and
discussed in first a sympathetic fashion followed by a critique. The
approaches considered will be primarily, but not exclusively,  psychoanalytic.
Each approach will be studied, interpreted, evaluated, and applied. More
specifically, the objective of the course is to enable the student to
understand and then think critically about the logic of each of the theories
that will be studied. This will involve being able to identify and make
informed judgments about their assumptions, problems, data, conceptual
categories, inferences and implications. The student is expected to give
evidence of a defensible understanding of each theorist before evaluating a
theorist. Also, questions are to be limited to questions of interpretation.
Disagreements are to be put in the form of assertions.

  
**Course   Process:** |

The class session will combine experiential and didactic modalities. Since the
class sessions are primarily interactional in nature, it is a course
requirement that all reading and assignments be done in advance of each class
session. Since the class sessions are occasionally experiential in nature,
some classroom stress might be anticipated.

**Course   Evaluation:** |

The students final grade will, in part, reflect the students overall
contribution to the class discussions.

Credit will be given for the following:

    * observations,
    * questions of interpretation,
    * answers to question,
    * agreements with reasons and
    * refutations with reasons
.  
Rejections and repudiations along with criticisms or evaluations based on
"straw man" interpretations of the text will result in loss of credit.

The grading of written homework will involve:  


    * Rhetorical purpose: Does the student directly address the assignment called for, such as use of a topical sentence or thesis statement?
    * Details and development: Is there evidence presented from the paragraph that fleshes out the topical sentence (e.g., arguments, reasons, & examples)?
    * Integration: overall coherence.
    * Mechanics: Does the student employ good written style, sentence structure, and word usage?
  
responsibilities.  Homework must be sent by Monday 4:00 pm. for credit and
class attendance.  


The exams will be comprehensive, objective and partly open-book.

Grades will be based solely on student achievement as measured by subjective
instructor judgments of written homework, classroom related contributions, and
three objective exams. While my office door is always open to students and
their concerns, attempts by students to influence their grades by other means,
such as stating what grade they need, or asking what they need to do
individually to get a specific grade, or redundant requests for feedback, are
considered violations of academic ethics. I do encourage students to
individually discuss with me how they can more effectively achieve the course
objectives. In this regard, sooner is better than later.  


Course grade will be determined approximately as follows: _Classroom
contributions & bulletin board, 30%; Homework, 50%; Project 10%, Exams, 10%_ .

The multimedia project involves a short psychoanalytic literary analysis of a
short narrative. Here are some suggested [Narratives.](narrit.htm)

ADDENDUMS: |

Students are required to obtain an e-mail address the first day of class, and
to check their electronic mail at least once every 24 hours. Students are also
required to check the class home page at least four times a week. E-mail, for
student-student and teacher-student communication, will be an integral part of
the course. Written work will involve one or more paragraph responses to
questions over homework assignments. Three to five open-book objective
examinations will be given and they will test comprehension of the texts.
Class participation will be evaluated globally on a bi-weekly basis using the
criteria mentioned above.

In order to maintain an effective classroom learning environment, each student
has the following responsibilities:  


    * Please come to class on time. Do not come to class tardy. If you can not make it to class on time, please do not come.
    * Please come to class prepared. Do not come to class if you have not completed your reading assignment and turned in your homework.
    * Please remain engaged with the class discussions and presentations. Do not carry on private conversations in class or work on assignments or projects that are not directly related to the class session. If you do either of the above you will be asked to leave the classroom.
    * While you are free to discuss your reading assignments with classmates, all written homework is to be done individually. To get help from others in answering homework questions will be considered cheating. If you feel the need to cheat , please discuss the problem with me first.
    * Late work will generally not be accepted.
    * Class attendance is necessary for participation credit.
I am aware that there are exceptions to most rules. I will be flexible when
documented hardships and unavoidable circumstances occur.

.  
**DISCLAIMER:** : |

Controversial issues are discussed in this class including matters of
politics, religion and sexuality. If these topics are not acceptable subjects
for you, please drop this class and enroll in a different class immediately.
If you are more sensitive than average to the above topics, it is your
responsibility to give advance warning to the instructor. Also, the class
sessions will have an experiential component where the student will be asked
to volentarily relate concepts discussed in class to their own personal
experiences and personal histories. If you are uncomfortable participating in
this type of discussion, it is your responsibility to inform the instructor at
the beginning of the semester, or at the earliest possible time, so that the
instructor will know not to call on you in class. Finally, alternate
assignments can be made for students who do not wish to be involved with a
specific class session. Finally, if you are offended, it is your
responsibility to tell the instructor of your concern at the first instance of
offense (or immediately inform another member of the instructor's department
in private, who in turn will inform the instructor). Discussing the offense
with other persons not directly involved and mentioning names will be
considered a form of  harassment by the student of the instructor.

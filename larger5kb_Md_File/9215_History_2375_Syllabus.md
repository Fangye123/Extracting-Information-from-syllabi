**Course Details**

**1.Description**

     This course surveys the development of Indian (South Asian) civilization and culture from ancient times to approximately 1500. The region examined corresponds to the modern-day nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. This course is one of two offered on the History of the Indian Subcontinent. The other, History 2376, covers the history of the Indian subcontinent from 1500 to the present.  
**2.Curricular Value of Course**

     This course has no prerequisites. It is intended for students from all disciplines with no or little systematic knowledge of South Asian cultures. For history majors, this course can count toward fulfilling the Group III course requirements. It is also an appropriate history course for fulfilling the Asian Area Studies Concentration. (See me for details about this minor.) If needed, this course can serve (via substitution) as a Area 2 course in the University Core Curriculum.

**3.Learning Objectives**

     a.Having successfully completed this course, a student will be able to:

    *describe key historical forces and individuals that shaped early South Asia civilization and culture

    *identify different interpretations of ancient and medieval South Asian history and draw comparisons with historical interpretations of other world regions

    *explain important terms and concepts that uniquely pertain to South Asian civilization and culture

    *describe and interpret certain works of art, literature, and other aspects of South Asian culture

    *contrast early South Asian civilization with other early global civilizations

    b.This course aims to instill greater appreciation of and sensitivity towards South Asian cultures.

    c.This course provides various opportunities for students to develop skills in critical thinking, writing, and oral communication.

    NOTE: I am willing to devote extra time to students with disabilities or those having difficulties with any aspect of this course. **4.Nature/Organization of Course**

     Class sessions will consist of lectures, discussions of readings, presentation/discussion of audio-visual materials, occasional sessions in a computer lab, and possible student presentations. This course requires active participation; thus attendance is important and is expected. I will regularly give assignments to promote participation.

    IMPORTANT NOTE: This course will be conducted in accord with the Virginia Tech Honor System. I will not hesitate to forward instances of cheating and plagiarism to the Honor Court.   
**5.Evaluation (% of course grade)**

     a. **Mid-term and final examinations (30%; each worth 15%)**.  

     These may be in-class or take-home. Guidelines will be provided one week before each exam.

    b. **Two formal assignments (30%; each worth 15%)**.  

     The required length of each will be 4-6 typed pages (double-spaced).  
    The first will require comparison of written and dramatic versions of the **Mahabharata**. The second will require a critical analysis and assessment of Alberuni's writings on India. Further details on each assignment will be provided. One of these assignments may be pursued in collaboration with one or two peers. A research paper, project, or class presentation of a comparable effort on a topic of your choice may be substituted for either (but not both) assignments. You must consult me if pursuing an optional assignment and consult atleast five sources.

     c. **Short reflection papers (20%)**  

     These will be assigned weekly except during weeks when exams are given or formal writing assignments are due. These will serve both to prompt discussion and to provide me feedback on your understanding of materials covered in the course. You will also have opportunities to write about campus events related to the course, such as cultural exposes, movies, and lectures. You will receive a number grade (out of 10 points) on each assignment, but a cumulative letter grade will only be given on completion of all the assignments.

    d. **[Optional Requirement: Participation in the International Friendship Program (35%)](friendship.html)**

     e. **Class participation (20%)**  

     As noted, this course requires active participation. I routinely note every student's presence and activity after each class. Regular attendance and participation will facilitate smooth functioning of the class. I much appreciate being informed if you will be absent. In addition I expect each of you to visit my office for an informal chat at least once during the semester (preferably during the early weeks) and will expect each of you to introduce and lead a discussion on an assigned reading at least once during the semester.

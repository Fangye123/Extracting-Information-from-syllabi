This course examines the Asian-American historical experience. We will study
this experience by looking at a range of written and visual sources produced
by or about Asian Americans during the last century and a half, including non-
fiction, fiction, and cinema. Topics of particular interest include
immigration motivations, Asian-American legal status, tensions within Asian-
American families, the relationships of Asian-Americans to their countries of
origin, and the emergence of Asian-American activism.

Explanation of Assignments:  
1\. **Examinations**  
Both the **Midterm and Final examinations** will consist of identifications
and essay questions testing your mastery of the subject matter. Study guides
will be distributed before each examination.  
  
  
2\. **Personal Writing Project**  
Each student is required to design, research, and write a detailed, **five to
seven page (5-7) paper on a topic of personal interest relevant to Asian-
American studies**. You _must_ get my approval for your selection before
beginning your project. The exact form of the project will vary, but all will
show evidence of research and careful writing. Some possibilities for projects
might include working on family histories, reviews of Asian American
literature, or analyses of a contemporary Asian American issue. I am also open
to more creative possibilities, but they must show the same rigor that more
conventional approaches display.  
  
3\. **Class Presentation of Writing Project**  
Each student is required to present the results of her or his writing project
to the class. Each presentation will require 5 minutes. I will evaluate the
quality of each presentation and this will figure heavily in your class
participation grade. Note that most students will present their projects to
the class before the final deadline for submitting the written version. The
schedule will be announced in the first two weeks of the semester, and the
order of presentations will be chosen at random, **so start your project
early!**  
  
4\. **Submission of contemporary issue article**  
To help us prepare for the discussion of contemporary issues at the end of the
semester. Each student is required to submit one article that raises or
addresses some significant issue for Asian Americans. The articles can be from
a newspaper, magazine, academic journal, etc. You will also be expected to
submit a brief paragraph explaining what the issue is.  
  
5\. **Reading Quizzes**  
Periodic unannounced reading quizzes are also part of your participation
grade.  
  
**Grading policies:**  
Please note the following policies:  

* Letter grades are assigned according to the following scale: A=93-100, A-=90-92, B+=87-89, B=83-86, B-=80-82, C+=77-79, C=73-76, C-=70-72, D+=67-69, D=63-66, D-=60-62, E=less than 60. Please note that work never turned in counts as a zero (0).  

* Late papers lose one grade step for each day late (thus a B+ that is two days late receives a B-).  

* I do not give make-up examinations or quizzes unless you have an acceptable and documented excuse (for example, a medical excuse signed by a physician).  

* I will not consider requests for incompletes without a clearly documented and acceptable reason.  

* Plagiarism is using or purchasing the words or ideas of another and passing them off as one's own work. If a student quotes someone in a formal paper, that student must use quotation marks and give a citation. Paraphrased or borrowed ideas are to be identified by proper citations. Plagiarism will result, at the minimum, in a zero (0) for the assignment.

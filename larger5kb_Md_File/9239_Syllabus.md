**GOALS OF COURSE**

This introductory history course should help students develop a global
perspective on the most important features of the past five centuries, the
present state of the world, and the prospects for the future. The present will
be a focus because we can hardly presume to understand the past if we do not
understand the present, and the future will be explored to anticipate what
life on this planet will be like in the decades ahead. However, most class
time will be devoted to the past.

Geographically, the course will cover all the continents, major islands,
oceanic and sea basins of the world. Chronologically, the course will begin
with the early modern world from the 1500s to the late 1700s, when modern
ideas and institutions were developing and global exchanges were limited. The
course will continue with the modern world from the early 1800s through the
1930s, when innovations in industry, transportation and government led to
modernization and much more extensive global exchanges. The course will
conclude with the contemporary world from the outbreak of World War II to the
present, particularly the effects of technology, demography, and
communications that have been increasingly associated with globalization.

For the first midterm examination, the course will focus on Europe, Eurasia,
and the Americas where most modern ideas and institutions appeared. For the
second midterm, the course will examine modernization and globalization in the
Islamic world and South Asia. For the final examination, the course will
explore modernization and globalization in East Asia and Africa.

Students should gain understanding of what the world has gained and what the
world has lost during five centuries of modernization and globalization, as
well as the advantages that some parts of the world have had over other parts.
A broadly comparative approach will be used to show the most significant
changes that have taken place during the last half millennium in terms of
communications, culture, demography, diplomacy, economics, environment,
government, natural resources, religion, science, technology, trade and
transportation, warfare, and women throughout the world.

**Grades**

Professor Adelson does not grade on a curve, and is willing to give high marks
to students who do high quality work: 90-100 = A, 80-89 = B, 70-79 = C, 60-69
= D, 59 and below = E.

The two mid-term examinations and the final examination will each count 1/4 of
the grade. The final will only cover material since the second mid-term
examination. For those excused from taking the regular exam, there will only
be one make-up for each mid-term and the final examination in Adelson's
office, at the times specified in this syllabus.

The last 1/4 of the grade will average the scores of several unannounced
quizzes over the interview assigned for a specific day. Quizzes may not be
made up, but the lowest quiz score or one missed quiz will not be counted.
Adelson will take attendance at each class period. Unless there is an
emergency, he will only excuse students if they have informed him in advance
(9 a.m. on the day of class). More than two unexcused absences will mean
Adelson deducts one point from the final average for every unexcused absence.
For example, a student who has three unexcused absences will find their 90
final average lowered to 89, or a B. On the other hand, excellent attendance
and participation in class discussions may raise the final average a point or
two.

For students to receive their grades for their final exam and for their final
grade, they must provide Adelson with a stamped, self-addressed postcard or
envelope. Adelson will be on sabbatical leave from ASU from mid-May, 2000 to
mid-August, 2001.

**UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN MAINE MISSION STATEMENT **

The University of Southern Maine, with a rich history reaching back to 1878,
is a comprehensive metropolitan university offering baccalaureate,
professional, graduate, and associate degrees within the University of Maine
System. The University of Southern Maine's fundamental mission is teaching,
research, and public service for the benefit of the citizens of Maine and
society in general. In achieving its mission and fulfilling its
responsibilities as a university, the University of Southern Maine addresses
the aspirations and needs of southern Maine, and serves as a vehicle for
linking southern Maine and the State to the nation and the world. The
University actively encourages faculty, staff, and students to contribute to
and participate in State, national, and international academic and
professional communities.

The University's principal responsibility is to provide a wide range of
programs responsive to students diverse in age, background, and experience,
many of whom are part-time, employed, and/or commuter students. Undergraduate
education at the University of Southern Maine aims to provide every student a
solid foundation in the liberal arts and the sciences. Master's, professional,
and selected doctoral degrees, and research programs emphasize the integration
of theory and practice. The University of Southern Maine seeks to assure broad
access at various  
geographic locations to educational opportunities including life-long
learning, and is committed to providing academic and support services
essential to the needs of a diverse student body. This commitment extends to
creating a sense of university community and a vibrant, diverse cultural
environment for the University of Southern Maine's students, faculty, staff,
and the entire community of southern Maine. In all activities the University
continually strives for excellence in teaching and learning.

As an essential Maine resource, the University sets program priorities that
are driven by the needs of the people and institutions of southern Maine in
particular and the State in general. The University of Southern Maine responds
to the special needs of, and provides leadership for, southern Maine's many
cultural, health, human service, business, and technological institutions and
activities. The University fulfills a historical and special commitment to
elementary and secondary education through the preparation of teachers and
educational leaders. The University of Southern Maine links the teaching,
research, and public service capabilities of faculty and staff, through both
traditional and interdisciplinary programs and units, with the people,
organizations, and Institutions of the State and the region. As one of seven
campuses in the University of Maine System, the University of Southern Maine
complements and collaborates with the other six institutions in the System to
fulfill the needs of public higher education in the State of Maine.

**COURSE ADMINISTRATION**

A College or School may have Course Administration requirements in addition to
those listed below.

**A)** **CLASS LISTS**

A temporary class list will be provided at the first class meeting. Additions
should be made by each faculty member as evidenced by the "add" forms they
authorize. It is the responsibility of the student to initiate an "add" form.
Drops are processed directly with the Registrar. Class lists are accessible
interactively on the computer and drops are displayed. Later in the semester
an updated class list will be provided. A final grade roster will be received
during the last week of classes.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**B)** **SELECTION OF TEXTBOOKS AND OTHER DEPARTMENTAL POLICIES**

Faculty should consult with their Department Chairperson/Director, the staff
at Lewiston-Auburn College or the Office of Off-Campus Instruction and
Division of Academic Support as appropriate, in regard to the selection of
textbooks and other departmental policies.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**C)** **COURSE SYLLABUS**

At the first class meeting, the instructor is expected to distribute to each
student a written syllabus setting forth the course objectives and/or learning
outcomes, major topics to be covered, a schedule of assignments, the grading
procedures for the course including, but not necessarily  
limited to, the weight to be given quizzes, reports, class participation,
examinations scheduled throughout the semester, and the final examination.
Some Schools/Colleges have additional requirements, however, the following
items should, at a minimum, be discussed in detail in the syllabus:

**1)** **COURSE OBJECTIVES/OUTCOMES**

It should be clear in the syllabus the knowledge for which students will be
responsible, the skills and techniques students should master; and the kinds
of ideas that will be developed in class. These objectives and/or outcomes
should be articulated in writing and discussed with the students at the first
class meeting. It is also important to cite that the University of Southern
Maine expects a teacher to be able to convey the importance and skills of the
teacher's discipline to students, to organize and present the materials of the
courses and conduct the courses in ways that achieve the teacher's
objectives/outcomes and stimulate students to intellectual development.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**2)** **TEXTBOOK(S) AND OTHER MATERIALS**

The instructor should list the textbook(s) and other materials needed for the
course and should indicate whether such materials are required or optional.
Instructor generated materials, that do not require the acquisition of
copyright permission, may be distributed in class but may not be sold directly
to the students. The USM Bookstores should be contacted regarding the
production and resale of instructor generated materials.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**3)** **COPYRIGHTED MATERIALS**

Copyrighted materials cannot be printed by the Printing Center for
distribution to students without permission of the author, publisher, or
journal, and cannot be sold through the Bookstore without payment of the
proper royalties. The Custom Publishing service offered by the USM Bookstores
is available to all faculty members. The store staff will obtain permission to
reproduce materials, oversee production by the Printing Center, sell finished
course packs to students and assure that proper royalties are paid. Questions
regarding custom publishing may be answered by calling the Textbook Department
at the Portland Bookstore (780-4070). **There is a University of Maine System
policy on Guidelines on Classroom Use of Copyrighted Material that you may
request from the offices of Deans and Directors.**

In accordance with the U.S. copyright guidelines, videotapes which have been
obtained to use without public performance rights (e.g. those which have been
rented or purchased through local video stores) can be used ONLY in face-to-
face teaching activities in a classroom or similar places devoted to
instruction. Prohibited uses of such videotapes include using them for
entertainment, recreation, community lectures or arts series, or for their
cultural or intellectual value but are unrelated to a specific teaching
activity.

For further information concerning the use of videotapes and other non-print
materials at the University of Southern Maine, please contact Educational
Media Services.

**4)** **ATTENDANCE POLICY**

The attendance policy is left to the discretion of the faculty member. It is
the responsibility of the faculty member to inform students in each class of
the attendance requirements for the class and to include the policy in the
course syllabus.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**5 _)_** __**OFFICE HOURS**

Faculty members are expected to schedule office hours for consultation with
students and these should be listed on the course syllabus. Office hours
should be regarded as an integral part of the teaching work load. At a
minimum, part-time faculty should schedule the opportunity for student
consultation before and after each class.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**6)** **EXAMINATIONS**

No specific type of evaluation instrument is recommended but all evaluations
should be designed to measure the attainment of objectives. Examination dates
should be scheduled in advance and the dates listed in the syllabus. No quiz,
test or examination may be scheduled during the last week of classes. The
final examination, if used, must be given during the regularly scheduled USM
final examination period (see Academic Calendar).

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  
**7)** **ASSIGNMENTS**

The course syllabus should clearly define the assignments, papers, reports and
other work required and the schedule for completion.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  
**8) MEASURING A STUDENT'S FORMULATION, ORGANIZATION AND** **ARTICULATION OF
THOUGHT**

Many faculty measure/evaluate the student's ability to formulate, organize and
articulate thought. When this is part of the faculty evaluation of a student's
performance, and is in addition to evaluating the student's comprehension of
the subject matter, a statement to this effect should be on the syllabus.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  
**9) DISABILITY ACCESS STATEMENT**

**It is very important** to also include information on the syllabus for those
students needing accommodations due to a disability. Sample:  "If you need
course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, please make an
appointment with me or the Office of Academic Support for Students with
Disabilities as soon as possible."

---  
  
  

**USM POLICY ON DISPOSITION OF WRITTEN, GRADED MATERIAL**

**A)** **WRITTEN MATERIAL RECEIVED DURING THE SEMESTER**

Faculty members giving students any type of test, quiz, research, or other
type of paper or any type of written proficiency examination which affects the
student's final (cumulative) grade shall:

**1 )** Return the written graded material to the student within fifteen (15)
days, inclusive of the day the material is due, in which the University has
classes, or

**2)** Hold the written, graded material for a period of thirty (30) days,
inclusive of the day the material is due, in which the University has classes.
During this period the material must be available for inspection by the
students who did the work.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**B)** **WRITTEN MATERIAL RECEIVED AT THE END OF THE SEMESTER**

**1)** Offer to mail the corrected (graded) material to the student provided
the student supplies a stamped, self-addressed envelope. Examinations that are
to be mailed must be postmarked within fifteen (15) calendar days of the last
day of the semester. The last day of the semester shall be the day in which
all classes and examinations cease for the semester. This policy is applicable
to take home examinations.

**2)** If the material is not returned or cannot be returned as a result of
standardized testing, the graded material shall be made available for
inspection by the student who did the work for a period of not less than the
first thirty (30) class days of the following semester.

**3)** For Lewiston-Auburn courses, final exams and papers are kept on file
for student pick-up for one semester after the course is completed.

**COURSE AND INSTRUCTOR EVALUATIONS**

Near the end of each academic session a course and instructor evaluation form
will be administered in each class by someone designated in accordance with
the department/division's approved evaluation procedures. This individual may
be a student. To insure confidentiality of these evaluations, instructors are
not to administer them. The evaluation forms will be distributed, collected
and returned to the appropriate office only by the individual designated to
administer the evaluation. The results of this evaluation process will be
included in the faculty member's personnel file. These will be available to
the instructors at the same time as the computerized results are obtained by
the department, but not prior to the time grade report rosters have been
received by the Registrar's Office.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


  
**ACADEMIC** **POLICIES**

**A)** **LATE REGISTRATION**

At the University of Southern Maine, students are allowed to register through
the first week of classes. For late afternoon and evening classes that meet
once a week, students may register through the second week, providing they
attended the second class meeting.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**B)** **ADD/DROP**

Recognizing that circumstances arise that make it necessary for students to
change class  
schedules, USM has designated an Add/Drop period during which these changes
may be made.  
The time period for Add/Drop is as follows:

**1)** **ADD** A student may add any course during the first week of classes.
For late  
afternoon and evening classes that meet once a week, students may add any
course through the second week, providing they attended the second class
meeting. Payment is required when the student hands in the Add form.

**2)** **DROP** Classes may be dropped with no financial penalty during the
first two weeks of classes.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**C)** **COURSE WITHDRAWAL**

Students may withdraw from classes using the Add/Drop form and receive an
automatic grade of **W** , if the form is processed between the beginning of
the third week of classes and through the eighth week of classes. Beyond the
eighth week of classes, a **Course Withdrawal Form** must be used to withdraw
from any class. At this point in the semester instructors have the prerogative
to:

> **1)** Assign the student an **F** for the course, or

>

> **2)** With the approval of the Dean or Director, and then only in unusual
circumstances, a grade of **W** may be assigned.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**D)** **INCOMPLETE GRADES**

It is the instructor's decision as to whether or not an incomplete should be
given. As a general rule, an incomplete is assigned only in extenuating
circumstances and only if the amount of work to be completed is limited.
Incomplete grades must be resolved by the end of each subsequent semester or
revert to an F. The faculty member may designate a shorter period of time for
the resolution of incomplete grades.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


******E)** **ATTENDANCE VERIFICATION**

At about the eighth week of each semester, the University's Registrar sends
updated class lists to faculty members. These lists are used to verify the
attendance of students and allow instructors the opportunity to note students
who do not appear on a list. These lists are then used to update the computer
file so that final grade report rosters may be produced. **It is an important
process and faculty members are urged to read and follow carefully
instructions sent with the verification lists and return them in a timely
fashion.**

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  
  

**F) STUDENTS IN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITIES**

Participation in extracurricular activities is an integral part of the
educational experience for many students at USM. Many of our finest students
are artists, musicians, and athletes who represent the University with their
talents. Faculty are urged to make reasonable accommodations for students who
must miss class time to represent the University in extracurricular
activities. In order to simplify the process, students will be advised to
notify faculty of their involvement in these activities at the beginning of
each semester. University athletic coaches may also contact faculty at least
once per semester in order to monitor the academic progress of student-
athletes. These students may be excused from attending classes but **are not**
excused from any assigned classwork or examinations. Faculty should be
sensitive to the scheduling conflicts of these students and modify assignment
and exam dates as necessary.

![Link back to top of page](images/top.gif)  
  
---  
  


**G)** **GRADING POLICY**

Grades at the University of Southern Maine are given in terms of letters, with
the option of a plus or minus designation, representing levels of achievement.
The basis for determining a grade is the relative extent to which the student
has achieved the objectives of the course. **Note: grades  
of A+ or D- are not valid.**

**A** High honors

**B** Honors

**C** Satisfactory, successful, and respectable meeting of the course
objectives. (Note: may not apply to graduate-level work).

**D** Low level work, below the average required for graduation for an
undergraduate and a failing grade for a graduate student.

**F** Failure to meet the course objectives.

**H** Honors in pass-fail course.

**P** Pass: Given only for courses open to the pass-fall option.

**I** Incomplete: A temporary grade given when the student because of
extraordinary circumstances has failed to complete course requirements.
Incomplete grades must be resolved by the end of the next semester; the
Registrar will notify faculty members involved and their Department Chair or
the Office of Extended Academic Programs, if appropriate, of students who have
carried unresolved incompletes on their transcripts for one semester. Under
special circumstances, the instructor may request that the Dean or Director
extend the time limit for a specific time period.

**INC** Permanent incomplete: When a temporary incomplete grade is not
resolved to a normal letter grade, a permanent incomplete may be assigned in
extraordinary circumstances, as recommended by the instructor and approved by
the Dean or Director. In the circumstance in which an instructor is no longer
available, the Dean or Director may assign this grade.

**MG** Missing grades: Occasionally, faculty assign students invalid grades
for a course or fail to submit a grade for a particular student in a course.
In these cases, the Registrar's Office will note this by designating a Missing
Grade, **MG** , instead of a grade for the course. This situation must be
resolved in the same manner as incompletes.

W Withdrawal after the first week through the eighth week of a semester. If a
student has not officially withdrawn by the end of the eighth week of a
course, one of the regular grades, normally **F** , will be assigned. The
**W** notation may be obtained after the eighth week under unusual
circumstances as recommended by the instructor and approved by the Dean or
Director.  

**Y** Satisfactory progress after one semester of a two-semester course with
grade and credits to be given upon completion of a second semester.

**L** Stopped attending. The grade of **L** may be assigned to students who
stopped attending a course without officially dropping the course. The grade
of **L** will be computed as an **F** for the purposes of the student's grade
point average.

**H)** **FINAL GRADES**

Final grades are due in the Registrar's Office seven calendar days after the
last day of final examinations. Because semester grades are used in
determining the academic progress of students and may have financial
implications, it is imperative that grades be submitted in a timely fashion.
For example, when a faculty member fails to submit a grade on time, the ISIS
system assigns a grade of MG which counts as a 0 in the GPA. This may then
cause a student to be placed on probation, or even suspension unnecessarily.
Part time faculty teaching on a contract per course basis who submit grades
late may jeopardize their position with the University of Southern Maine.

**I)** **STUDENT ACADEMIC APPEALS POLICY**

In order to guarantee fair and equal settlement of student grievances in the
area of academic affairs, this policy exists. Academic grievances generally
involve an appeal of grades granted or unfair or discriminatory treatment by a
faculty member. A series of steps are to be taken by the student in the
following order. The student contacts:.

1\. The faculty member involved,  
2\. The department chairperson,  
3\. The dean of the school or college,  
4\. The provost.

If after this process has been followed and the student feels the grievance
has not been satisfactorily resolved, the Student Grievance Committee, as
outlined in the USM Governance  
document, may be convened by the Student Senate. This committee will review
the grievance and report its findings to the president. Final decision-making
power rests with the president. Note that the above procedures apply only to
undergraduate appeals. Graduate students should follow the procedures as
outlined in the _Graduate Catalog_.

**J) STUDENT ACADEMIC INTEGRITY POLICY **

The academic community of the University of Southern Maine recognizes that
adherence to high principles of academic integrity is vital to the academic
function of the University. Academic integrity is based upon honesty. All
University students are expected to be honest in their  
academic endeavors. All academic work should be performed in a manner which
will provide an  
honest reflection of the knowledge and abilities of each student. Any breach
of academic honesty should be regarded as a serious offense by all members of
the academic community.

The entire academic community shares the responsibility for establishing and
maintaining standards of academic integrity. Those in charge of academic tasks
have an obligation to make known the standards and expectations of acceptable
academic conduct. Each student has an obligation to know and understand those
standards and expectations. While the academic community recognizes that the
responsibility for learning and personal conduct is an individual matter, all
students and faculty members are expected to help maintain academic integrity
at the University by refusing to participate in, or tolerate, any dishonesty.

Violations of student academic integrity include any actions which attempt to
promote or enhance the academic standing of any student by dishonest means.
Some examples include, but are not limited to, cheating on examinations,
stealing the words or ideas of another (plagiarism), making statements which
are known to be false or misleading, falsifying the results of one's research,
improperly using library materials or computer files, obtaining or attempting
to obtain an examination before it has been given, intentionally attempting to
interfere with or prevent others from having fair and equal access to the
resources of the University's libraries or computers, or altering or forging
academic records are examples of violations of this policy which are contrary
to the academic purposes for which the University exists.

Acts which violate academic integrity disrupt the educational process and are
not acceptable. Evidence of a violation of this academic policy may result in
disciplinary action. For more information concerning this topic, including the
procedures governing hearings convened by the Student Academic Integrity
Board, contact the Office of Community Standards, 125 Upton Hall, Gorham
Campus at **780-5242.**

**K)** **STUDENT JUDICIAL AFFAIRS**

Students who attend USM are expected to conduct themselves and their affairs
with regard to the rights of others. The University has rules and regulations
which govern students, faculty and staff. Also, all members of the campus
community are governed by local, state and federal laws.  
If a student violates a University regulation, the student may be subject to
disciplinary action by  
the University according to the Student Conduct Code. This document, used by
all campuses in the University of Maine System, allows each campus to take
action appropriate to the violation. Additionally, any sanction issued under
this System Conduct Code on one campus will remain in effect on any of the
other campuses. For example, a student while under suspension from USM, may
not attend any other campus in the University of Maine System. It is also
important to know that if a student violates state or federal laws, whether on
or off campus, the student may be subject to state and federal discipline as
well as University action.

Approximately 600 students each year violate the Student Conduct Code and are
handled by the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. A variety of disciplinary
sanctions are routinely given including warnings, assignment to alcohol
discussion groups and assessment, community service, residence hall contract
probation, University disciplinary probation, suspension for a period of time
and dismissal. For more information concerning this topic, contact the Office
of Community Standards, 125 Upton Hall, Gorham Campus, **780-5242.**

**L)** **PRIVACY OF STUDENT RECORDS**  
  
The University of Southern Maine complies with the Family Rights and Privacy
Act of 1974 This law protects the student from the disclosure of personal
information with the exception of the following  "Public Directory" elements:
name, date of birth, major, dates of attendance, degree, academic honors,
previous institution attended, class year, and participation in activities and
sports. The law also guarantees the student access to his or her records and
gives the student the right to prohibit the disclosure of "Public Directory"
information. The Registrar's Office, Corthell Hall, Gorham Campus, should be
consulted before disclosing any student information. The Registrar also has a
more detailed description of the law available for review.

**ACADEMIC ADVISING SERVICES**

**A)** **ACADEMIC ADVISING**

Academic advising is an important professional responsibility of each faculty
member. Faculty members are expected to be knowledgeable about academic
requirements, including the Core Curriculum, the major and minor fields of
study in the Department in which they are a member or teach as a part time
faculty member, and the policies concerning electives. In advising students
the faculty member should be aware that any substitutions or waivers involving
the Core Curriculum requirements may be approved only by the appropriate
Dean/Director and substitutions or waivers in the major and minor fields of
study may be approved only in accordance with Departmental policy.

**B)** **REFERRAL OF STUDENTS**

When an instructor determines that a student could benefit from personal,
academic, or career counseling, the student should be referred to Advising
Services at 780-4040, the Counseling Center at 780-4050, or the Career
Services Office at 780-4220, depending on the circumstances. Additionally, the
student's academic counselor is also a good resource person in helping
students with problems that cannot be effectively handled in the classroom.

Course Objectives: In this course, we will examine various theoretical
perspectives related to the uses and effects of information technologies and
services. The course provides a foundation from which both scholars and
practitioners can conceptualize the factors that lead people to utilize
telecommunications systems, the needs that these systems fulfill, and the
effects of these systems on individuals, organizations, and society.
Theoretical perspectives are drawn from a variety of fields including
communication, economics, sociology, psychology, and management science.

Course Requirements: Readings are drawn from a multitude of sources, including
older classics and newer pieces. Required readings are made available through
a TC860 reading packet available from Budget Printing (351-5060) located on
Trowbridge Road. Students will be required to complete two in-class
examinations and one out-of-class paper, each worth 25% of the grade. In
addition, each student will be required to make contributions to class
discussions (in class and through the course webtalk site) to earn the
remaining 25% of the grade. Information on the exams, project, and class
participation will be provided in class and on the class web site.

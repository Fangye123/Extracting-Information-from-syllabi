**Overview**

This course seeks to explore both history and the art of history by in-depth
and comparative readings of  
contrasting historical writings on six themes.  These six themes are focused
on political and social history;  
they are discrete but interrelated, and the students will be asked to consider
the larger social and political  
themes of European history recurrent throughout the course.  The course is a
mix of lecture and  
discussion.  Students will be expected to take a high degree of responsibility
for their own eduction, both in  
terms of class discussion and research projects.

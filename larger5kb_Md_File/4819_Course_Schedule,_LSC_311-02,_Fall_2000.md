## What Is The General Education Core Curriculum?

> This course has been certified as one in New Mexico State University's
General Education Core Curriculum (GECC). The GECC attempts to foster
intelligent inquiry, abstract logical thinking, critical analysis and the
integration and synthesis of knowledge; it strives for literacy in writing,
reading, speaking and listening; it teaches mathematical structures; it
acquaints students with precise abstract thought about numbers and space; it
encourages an understanding of science and scientific inquiry; it provides a
historical consciousness, including an understanding of one's own heritage as
well as respect for other peoples and cultures; it includes an examination of
values and stresses the importance of a carefully considered values system;
and it fosters an appreciation of the arts. To summarize, general education
provides the breadth necessary to have a familiarity with the various branches
of human understanding.

## Course Description

Information Literacy, a Viewing a Wider World course, is designed to help you
become a full participant in our Information Society. Both practical and
theoretical in scope, LSC 311 uses a mixture of lecture, in-class and
electronic discussions, hands-on assignments, and written research projects to
give you the technological skills and critical thinking abilities you need to
use the printed and electronic information resources found in libraries and on
the international computer networks collectively known as the Internet. Once
you successfully complete this course you will be able to think critically
about research strategies, and be able to locate and critically evaluate
information, applying these skills and new-found knowledge to your academic
courses and in your professional and personal life.

## Brief Explanation of Course Requirements

_( Thorough descriptions will be given when assignments are made)_

> ### Information Reviews (150 pts.)

    You will hand in three written reviews for three different types of sources: 

    

A reference source - 50 pts.  
A scholarly journal - 50 pts.  
An Internet information source - 50 pts.

### Hands-on Assignments (200 pts)

> There will be five hands-on assignments. These require you to find, use and
evaluate different information resources and protocols. The objective is
twofold: 1. These assignments help you practice using information tools and
resources; 2. They also require you to search out, retrieve and evaluate
resources for your annotated bibliography. Sometimes, but not always, class
time will be used to complete these assignments.

### Quizzes & In-Class Assignments (125 pts)

> On a fairly regular basis, there will be quizzes covering the course
readings, and in-class assignments that will be graded. You will also be
expected to lead the discussion on one of the assigned readings.

### Final Paper, Annotated Bibliography & Rough Drafts (375 pts)

    Your final project has two parts:   
    

  1. Annotated bibliography on an instructor-approved topic of your choice - 110 pts.
  2. Evaluative essay which discusses and evaluates both your research process and your topic - 140 pts. 

      
You will need to begin collecting sources for your bibliography early in the
semester and are required to submit a short essay describing your topic and
your rationale for choosing the topic. This assignment is worth 25 points..
Two rough drafts will be due during the semester. They are worth 50 points
each, and will be graded. The draft requires you to submit 8 citations along
with a description of your research process and search strategies. The first
draft is due at the beginning of October. The second draft is due the second
week in Novemeber. The hands-on assignments and in-class exercises will help
you seek out the most appropriate citations for your topic. Sample papers are
on reserve at the Circulation Desk in Zuhl Library.  
  
Legibility of all written materials is required. Grammar and style are
critical elements in achieving academic excellence.

### Final Examination (150 pts)

> You will have a final exam. It will consist of multiple choice, short answer
items, problem sets and brief essay questions. All test items will be based on
material covered and/or discussed in class and in the assigned readings. The
final examination is designed to reward students who regularly attend class,
participate in class discussions, and keep up with the readings.

## Course Rules & Classroom Conduct

### **Due Dates**

    **All due dates for assignments are firm.**    
**Assignments are due at the beginning of class** , whether or not you are in
class. Assignments received during or at the end of class on the due date will
be counted as late. Late assignments will receive the following deductions:

**Days late** | **     Deduction**  
---|---  
During class | 10%  
At the end of class | 20%  
After class to 3 days | 50%  
4 days or more | 100%  
  
     
    Days late is calculated on a 7 day week, 24 hour day.  
  
 A physician's excuse detailing the reason(s) for the absence(s) and/or a
documented family crisis will be the only exception to deductions for late
assignments. In these cases, due dates for late assignments will be negotiated
with the instructor.

  

### **Attendance**

     Attendance is expected, but not mandatory. It is your responsibility to be prompt and attend class. Excessive absences could well result in failing the course. All examinations and all course assignments are based on in-class discussions, instruction, and practice. I will not schedule office hours to discuss missed or not fully comprehended assignments because you missed class.   
  
Please be on time. I will not repeat or update you on material missed because
of tardiness. If you miss a quiz because you are late, you may not take it
later. If you are late, please use the back entrance to the class in order to
avoid disturbing your classmates.

  

### **Withdrawals**

     You are responsible for dropping yourself from this course. I do not automatically drop students although in some cases I may advise a student to drop the course. The last day to drop the course with a W is October 18, 2000. 
  

### **Incompletes**

     Incompletes are given **only in special circumstances**. To receive an incomplete, you must have successfully passed the first half of the course and must be precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by either a **documented illness** or a **documented personal/family crisis** which I believe genuinely precludes you from successfully completing the course at the end of the semester. To be considered to have successfully passed the first half of the course, you must have a C average or higher by the 9th week of the semester.

###  Cell Phone Use

> Cell phone use during class is prohibited. If for some reason you need bring
a cell phone or a pager to class, please discuss your situation with me ahead
of time.

### **Multiple Submissions**

     I do not accept resubmissions of work done for other courses for your final paper or for any other assignments. The general topic of your final paper may be similar to one that you research for another course; however, the content, organization, and focus of the final paper for this course are so different that a resubmitted paper will be instantly recognized and will receive a failing grade. 
  

### **Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory**

     The minimum standard for an S grade is a C. 
  

### **Academic Misconduct**

     Anyone who willfully damages, steals, or makes inaccessible to others, library materials or computer resources, will be dropped from the course. Reading or sending e-mail, surfing the web, printing or using other applications on the computer workstations during lectures or presentations is not only rude it is **unacceptable**. Your screens can be viewed by others. (see below)       Plagiarism is unacceptable and will result in a failing grade. Cite all your sources. Paraphrase material used for assignments, reviews and papers. Always cite material that you use. 
  

### **Classroom Computers and Privacy**

     Your computer workstations are not private. Do not use class time for recreation or conversation.      The instructor workstation in this classroom is equipped **to view and display to the class, or to any individual in the class** each and every computer monitor the instructor wishes to display.            In addition, the instructor has the ability to blank all or individual computer screens as well as take over control of individual keyboards and mice.       
    Use caution in sending e-mail from classroom PCs. Nothing is private. You will be held responsible for what you do with and on the machines. 
  

### **Posting of Grades**

     By the 9th week of classes, I will post midterm grades on the course web page. With your consent, grades will be sorted and then posted by the last four digits of your SSN. Final grades will be posted in the same fashion.   
If anyone objects to this practice, please see me to discuss an alternate
method that is mutually agreeable to both us.

## Students with Disabilities

    If you have or believe you have a disability, you may wish to self-identify. You can do so by providing documentation to the Office for Services for Students with Disabilities, located at Garcia Annex (phone: 646-6840). Appropriate accommodations may then be provided for you. 

If you have a condition which may affect your ability to exit safely from the
premises in an emergency, or which may cause an emergency during class, you
are encouraged to discuss this in confidence with me and/or the Director of
Disabled Students Programs. If you have general questions about the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), call 646-3635.

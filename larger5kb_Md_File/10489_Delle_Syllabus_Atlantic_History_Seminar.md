> **COURSE OVERVIEW**  
>  In recent years an increasing number of archaeologists have focused their
work on understanding  
>  the material dimensions of the African experience in the Americas. This
course will consider what archaeology has to contribute to our understanding
of the historical experience of members of the African Diaspora through the
analysis of recent archaeological studies of the slave trade, plantation
slavery, and post-emancipation sites in both the Caribbean and American South.

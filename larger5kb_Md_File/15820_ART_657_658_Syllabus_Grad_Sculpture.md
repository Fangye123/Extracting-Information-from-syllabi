**OBJECTIVES**

> To develop a personal course of inquiry in sculpture.  No assignments will
be given, but the class will operate as a structured class applying all the
rules of attendance.  It is the student's responsibility to develop a course
of study and body of work that would demonstrate a structured course of
inquiry and solutions over the semester.  Once the initial outline/interest
has been established, I will assist by directing and making suggestions, give
demonstrations on materials, tools and processes according to individual
needs.  Although the work is individual, interaction will be structured and
participation in critiques and discussions mandatory.  All students are
expected to attend and participate in all visiting artists' and guests'
lectures.  It is not common practice on the graduate level to give grades
during the semester.  Every class meeting is a critique where there is an
exchange of dialogue.  Students usually have a very accurate sense of their
work level and progress; however, if this is an issue of concern, please
discuss it with me at any time.

**Evaluation:**

> 1.    A clear and succinct identification and outline of the area of
interest and study.  
> 2.    Research, supporting documentation and verbalization of ideas.  
> 3.    Understanding of sculptural concepts and issues supported by research
and work.  
> 4.    Experimentation, ideas, materials and processes.  
> 5.    The ability to analyze, apply and communicate ideas through a process
or methodology.  
> 6.    Presentation and execution of a body of work.

### History 548.01  
History of Japan before 1800



This course treats the history of Japan from the earliest times to the
beginning of the nineteenth century. It covers the subjects of religion,
politics, economic development, social trends and elements of the history of
ideas. In addition, the course will concern itself with Japan's mythic
tradition, culture and social structure and its interaction with mainland
civilizations.



**Academic Objectives:**

I want you to develop the following skills and competencies:

  1. To develop the ability to assess and think critically about historical issues and how people interpret those issues; 
  2. To gain a basic factual knowledge of this period in Japanese history; 
  3. To develop skills in analyzing historical data and reaching informed conclusions about those data.

**Examinations, Papers and Evaluation:**

  1. There will be no midterm examinations; however, I will from time to time give "pop" quizzes to be sure that everyone is mastering basic factual material in the course. If the class demonstrates that it is keeping up with learning the terms, there will be fewer quizzes. The lowest quiz grade will be dropped. There will be an optional objective test scheduled on the day of the final examination. This can be used to replace one additional quiz grade and is the only "make-up" for missed quizzes. 
  2. There will be three short papers (maximum 4 double-spaced, type-written pages for the first two, longer for the final paper) based on materials presented in the course, the last of which will serve as a final. Students may NOT use outside sources. 
  3. All students are required to write a term paper. The subject will be determined by the student in consultation with the professor. Further instructions will be distributed later. Graduate student papers will be longer and reflect more sophisticated research and analytical skills. 
  4. Graduate students are also required to write two book review essays of 4-5 pages each in place of the midterm. 
  5. All term papers are due at the start of class on Monday, 11/21. Graduate student book reviews are due at the start of class on 10/29 and 11/26. 
  6. Students are expected to attend all classes and to be prepared for and to participate in discussions. You are expected to be on time and to be in class except when you are sick or dealing with a true emergency.

**Enrollment:** All students must be officially enrolled by the end of the
second full week of the quarter. No requests to add will be approved by the
department chair after that. Proper enrollment is solely your responsibility.



**Lecture Topics and Assignments:** Readings for each unit should be completed
before the lectures on that unit begin. Thus, readings for Topic 2 should be
completed before the first class period of Week 2. NOTE that two books are
assigned toward the end of the quarter. Begin to read these earlier in the
quarter during one of the weeks when reading assignments are not so heavy.

The THIRD PAPER is due in class on December 10 at 9:30am (at the start of the
scheduled examination time). NO PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED AFTER THIS TIME.



**Some Important Guidelines:**

CARDINAL CLASS RULE: IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR NEED HELP regarding class
responsibilities, grading, and so forth, PLEASE talk with the instructor! I am
glad to help. If you are reluctant to ask questions in class, please discuss
your questions with me before or after class, during office hours, or by
appointment. If you drop by my office and I am out, PLEASE leave a note, with
your name and telephone number, and I will call you back.

COURTESY: Any behavior that distracts fellow students or the instructor, e.g.,
eating, drinking, chatting, reading the newspaper, watch alarms, etc., is not
acceptable. Please be considerate of others in the classroom. If you have
questions/comments, share them with the class -- your talking will distract
others; failure to raise a point in class or ask for clarification may mean
that everyone loses a chance to learn something.

ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT: It is the student's responsibility to be completely
familiar with the university policy on academic misconduct. If you have
questions it is your responsibility to raise them with the instructor.

LATENESS AND MAKE-UPS: No late assignments or absences from exams will be
accepted without the PRIOR agreement of one of the instructors or a doctor's
note. Only serious illness. earthquake, or other catastrophic event will be
regarded as a valid excuse.

PAPER I

Answer ONE of the following questions:

  1. Select one or two of the major characterizations Morris makes in The World of the Shining Prince and assess the degree to which it is borne out by The Gossamer Years. Why might the differences you find have arisen? 
  2. What are the responsibilities of court women in Heian society as revealed in The Gossamer Years? What are their chores, privileges, and entertainments? Using the biographies in The Nobility of Failure, compare and contrast their lives with those of male aristocrats. 
  3. Analyze the role of religion in the daily lives of Heain court nobility as revealed in The Gossamer Years. To deal with this question effectively and to take Heian beliefs seriously, you may have to work to "extract" yourself from the religious traditions of Islam, Christianity, and Judaism with which you are most familiar. 
  4. Is the society revealed in The Gossamer Years accurately characterized as "cosmopolitan"? To what degree does it show evidence of sinification? 
  5. Using the text and notes of The Gossamer Years, analyze the challenges of translating a work of ancient Japanese literature. 
  6. Using The Gossamer Years, analyze the sense of proper decorum among the nobility. Why does this aspect of their lives receive so much attention in the book? 



The paper should have a cover page with a title that illustrates your main
subject clearly and expresses your main idea. The cover sheet should also
clearly identify the number of the question you are answering. It can be a
maximum of 4 double-spaced, type-written pages of text. Foreign loan words not
commonly seen in English should be underlined or italicized. Pay attention to
proper grammar, spelling and word choice. Use page numbers, bearing in mind
that the title page and first page are unpaginated.

PAPER II

Answer ONE of the following questions using the translated primary sources and
other class readings:

  1. Describe, discuss, and analyze the transfer of political authority from the Imperial Court to warrior houses from the twelfth century through the early Ashikaga era. Why was the Court unable to re-establish its centrality in Japan's late Imperial and medieval political structures? 
  2. How did Buddhism change in Kamakura and Ashikaga Japan? What changes in doctrine and religious practice were important? Did they enable some sects of Buddhism to play new roles in Kamakura and Ashikaga society? Did contemporary political, social and economic developments change Buddhism and affect its appeal to various sectors of Japanese society? You should rely heavily on the translated primary source materials and readings other than Sansom. 
  3. Analyze the sources and outcomes of economic change (both domestic and international economic contexts) during this period. How did these conditions reinforce or alter the existing Japanese political, social and economic order? Consider such factors as the growth of autonomous towns like Sakai, guilds, agricultural developments, and changes in political control of rural areas. You should rely heavily on readings other than Sansom. 
  4. Analyze the degree to which the political and cultural problems of Kamakura and Ashikaga Japan are reflected in the tribulations of the "Noble Failures" of these two periods in Japanese history. 



The paper should have a cover page with a title that illustrates your main
subject clearly and expresses your main idea. The cover sheet should also
clearly identify the number of the question you are answering. It can be a
maximum of 4 double-spaced, type-written pages of text. Foreign loan words not
commonly seen in English should be underlined or italicized. Pay attention to
proper grammar, spelling and word choice. Use page numbers, bearing in mind
that the title page and first page are unpaginated.

PAPER III

Answer ONE of the following questions from Part A and the question in Part B
using the translated primary sources and other class readings:

PART A

  1. Why were the Tokugawa successful in establishing a long-lasting political order? Which contributed more to the creation of a more stable political order, the policies of the Shogun or a restructuring of local control in the daimyo domains? Compare and contrast their techniques of rule with those of the Ashikaga Shoguns. 
  2. Analyze the way in which philosophical and religious thought interacted with the new political order in late 16th to 18th century Japan. 
  3. Analyze the impact of more stable relationships in domains and a "peace dividend" transformed Japan's economy and social relations. Consider not only domain policies directly designed to foster economic growth, but those that eliminated problems for villagers (e.g., unfair retainer use of village labor). 

PART B

  1. In many respects the artistic accomplishments of men like Taiga and the urban culture that supported them and their literary counterparts like Chikamatsu, Basho and Ihara Saikaku are considered the high point of Tokugawa culture. Yet this same society gives us men like Oshio Heihachiro and Amakusa Shiro. To what degree were Oshio and Amakusa responding to the kind of lifestyle of people like "Musui" and Taiga? To what extent did the economic conditions that led Taiga and Musui to live their lives as they did also create the conditions which concerned Oshio and Amakusa? 



The paper should have a cover page with a title that illustrates your main
subject clearly and expresses your main idea. The cover sheet should also
clearly identify the number of the question you are answering. It can be a
maximum of 8 double-spaced, type-written pages of text. Foreign loan words not
commonly seen in English should be underlined or italicized. Pay attention to
proper grammar, spelling and word choice. Use page numbers, bearing in mind
that the title page and first page are unpaginated.

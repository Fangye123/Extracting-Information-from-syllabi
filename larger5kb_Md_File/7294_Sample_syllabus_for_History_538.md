problems of underdevelopment, collectivization and industrialization, the
retreat from revolutionary values, the delineation of gender roles, the Second
World War and its legacy, the Cold War, de-Stalinization, nationality issues,
and the Gorbachev era.

**Paper Assignment**

Write a 8-10 page book review of a scholarly monograph on some topic in Soviet
history. Choose a book on a topic that interests you. Consult the
bibliographies in Hosking or ask the professor for suggestions. Your review
should do more than simply summarize the book. It should critically evaluate
the book's argument, its use of sources, and its significance. Explain whether
you agree with the book's major points and why.

The following are some questions you may choose to discuss in your paper:

  1. Do you know anything about the author? (Read the book jacket, the acknowledgements, and the dedication. Note the publisher and year of publication.) Does the author have any clear biases or agendas that influence the book? 
  2. Does the book have a clear thesis? Does the author prove the thesis? Is the thesis a significant contribution to our understanding of Russian history? 
  3. What type of history is the focus of the book? (Political, social, cultural, religious, intellectual, biographical, psychological, administrative, military, or economic history.) What other types of history might be applied to this topic? 
  4. How does the author explain historical events and trends? What does s/he state or assume to be the causal forces in history? 
  5. What sources (treaties, speeches, decrees, government records, memoirs, statistics, etc.) does the author rely upon? Is the research well documented? Is the use of sources convincing? 

Papers will be graded on their writing style as well as their content. Be sure
to formulate clear arguments about the book. Support your arguments with
examples from the book (but avoid overly-long quotations), and provide the
page number in parentheses. Organize your paper carefully and include an
introduction and conclusion. Papers muse be typed, double-spaced, with one-
inch margins on all sides. Include a title page with your name, the title of
your paper, and the course number.

Extensions on the paper are granted at the discretion of the professor only to
those students presenting valid and verifiable excuses. Students who are
unable to complete the assignment for familial, legal, or medical reasons must
contact the professor no later than the due date. Work turned in late without
a valid excuse will be penalized by one letter grade per day late.

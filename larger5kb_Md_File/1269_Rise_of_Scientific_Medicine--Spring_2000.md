>> **_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**

>>

>> This course explores the historical development of cultural beliefs and
institutions in Western Europe and the United States during the nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries which led to the establishment of the modern system
of medicine. The focus of the course is primarily upon the role of natural
science in the transformation of medical theory, medical training, and medical
practice. We will explore the factors that enabled academically trained
physicians, schooled in the elements of experimental physiology, physiological
chemistry, the germ theory of disease, and pharmacologically based chemical
therapeutics, to displace other types of healers and emerge by the early
twentieth century as the sole providers of health care. In part our focus will
be on the professionalization of medicine and the role of scientific knowledge
and expertise in the making of the modern physician. No less crucial for our
consideration, however, is the creation of the modern patient; a major thesis
explored in the course is that the professionalization of medicine required at
the same time the medicalization of society. We will examine the
transformation of values and beliefs which enabled scientifically trained
professional physicians to be invested with cultural authority in matters of
sickness and health, and we will examine the ways in which this medical
authority was institutionalized in standardized training, evaluation, and
licensing, supported by a vast armamentarium of technology, centered in
clinics and hospitals. Beginning with the reform of medical institutions
during the French Revolution and the concomitant developments of pathological
anatomy and the Paris clinical tradition, the course will trace the
development of scientific and laboratory medicine throughout the nineteenth
and early twentieth centuries, culminating with the promised therapeutic
revolution to be effected by improved knowledge of biochemistry on the eve of
the discovery and commercial development of antibiotics in 1945\. Among other
topics we will consider are gender in medicine and the development of fields
such as medical genetics.

>> **COURSE FORMAT AND REQUIREMENTS:**

>>

>> The course will be conducted in lecture-discussion format. Each student is
required to make a class presentation with a group of students in the class on
one of the sets of assigned readings. You will be expected to work with
members of your group in preparing a stimulating and informative presentation.
Each student is also required to complete writing assignments totalling 10-15
pages (see explanation below for writing requirement). Course grades will be
assigned on the basis of performance on 1) the writing assignment(s) (45%), 2)
the class presentation (30%), and 3) quality of regular class participation
(25%).

>> **Suggestions for Writing Requirement**  
>  The writing requirement for this class is 10-15 typed double-spaced pages.
You may fulfill this requirement in a number of different ways.

>>

>> **Option 1.** You may write a) one longer or b) two shorter traditional
argumentative papers focused on some aspect of the history of medicine and
using one or more of the authors we are reading as a starting point for your
work; OR

You may combine any writing assignments for a total of 10-15 pages: e.g., two
review essays and one short research paper. You might use the materials of
your class presentation as the basis for writing a review essay, and complete
the remainder of the writing requirement with other reviews and/or a research
paper.

**Option 2.** You may construct a multimedia essay on some medical
development, such as penicillin, organ transplantation, or reconstructive
surgery.

>>

>>  
> **Due Dates:** If you elect to write only one long argumentative paper, then
the latest date it can be turned in is June 1. If you decide to write two
shorter argumentative papers or a combination of argumentative papers, you
need to turn in one completed component of your written work by April 29; the
remainder will be due on the last day of class, June 1. (This requirement
imposes some discipline so that you won't find yourself swamped with work for
this course at the end of the quarter.) If you choose to construct a
multimedia essay on some medical development, you have until June 9 to
complete your project.

### Holocaust and Genocide Studies

**

We live in a time of unparalleled instances of democide, genocide and
ethnocide. In fact, governmental policies have resulted in over 170 million
deaths during this century (1900-1987) and this figure excludes war deaths
([Rummel,
1995](http://www1.ca.nizkor.org//ftp.cgi/t/miscellany/curriculum/rummel.001)).
As Rummel states,"It surpasses the 1987 population of all but six nations in
the world". These statistics of course do not include the more recent deaths
due to genocide/democide and underestimate the additional toll on human life
from physical and psychological scarring. ![](cry1.gif)|  While most
individuals are aware of the Holocaust (although they often do not realize the
extent of the brutality and actual cost in terms of human life), many are not
aware of other past genocides/democides or of current genocides/democides. For
example, many individuals remain unaware of the Armenian genocide in Turkey,
the killing fields of Cambodia, the disappearances in Argentina & Chile, the
death squad killings in El Salvador, or Stalin's purges. Many are unaware of
recent events that have resulted in genocides in Bosnia and Rwanda/Burundi or
the extreme violations of human rights and genocidal policies by the
governments of China (including Tibet), Myanmar (Burma), and Indonesia
(including the genocide of the East Timorese). This site contains course
information, recommended readings, links, a chronology of the Holocaust and
recent news.

### Women's Intellectual Contributions to the Study of Mind and Society:
Anthropology, Psychology, Social Work, and Sociology

**

Women such as Christine Ladd-Franklin, Ruth Fulton Benedict, and Ida B. Wells
have traditionally been omitted from the histories of their disciplines. This
webpage is designed to re-place women into the history of psychology,
sociology, anthropology, and social work. Students, as part of an advanced
seminar, examined and wrote about the lives of these women, their intellectual
contributions, and the unique impact and special problems that being female
had on their careers. This webpage represents the culmination of these
students' work.

### Women and Global Human Rights

**

Discussions of human rights often fail to acknowledge the unique concerns of
women around the globe particularly as they relate to the subordination of and
injustices against women. Yet clearly, women's rights are human rights
concerns. Violence against women and girls is the most pervasive violation of
human rights in the world today. Discrimination against women and girls is an
important basic cause of malnutrition. The very high rates of child
malnutrition and low birth weight throughout much of South Asia are linked to
such factors as women's poor access to education and their low levels of
participation in paid employment, compared with other regions. Women comprise
70% of the world's poor. Eighty percent of the world's refugees are women and
children. And as stated by Her Excellency Mary Robinson, U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights, "Bonded labour and the traffic in women and
children have become our modern day versions of slavery." More than 1 million
children, mostly girls, are forced into prostitution every year. Students, as
part of an advanced seminar, examined and wrote about a variety of women's
international human rights concerns. This webpage represents the culmination
of these students' work.

### Gerontology Pages

**

Currently the population of the United States as well as other countries
throughout the world is rapidly aging. The demographics, however, are changing
at a faster rate than most individual's gerontological knowledge. In fact,
most individual's knowledge about the aged and the aging process consists
primarily of myth and stereotype. Therefore, this page contains: A knowledge
of aging quiz with answers; information concerning elder abuse and neglect,
long-term care (nursing home) selection tips, ageism, life review, and
gay/lesbian aging; links; and information related to Webster University's
Master of Arts in Applied Gerontology Program

  * Ethnopolitical Warfare : Causes, Consequences, and Possible Solutions (2001) by Daniel Chirot (Editor), Martin E. P. Seligman (Editor)

  * To order: [Amazon Books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1557987378/qid=1013240101/sr=1-37/ref=sr_1_37/002-1821331-5983249)

  * Book description from [APA](http://www.apa.org/books/431649A.html): Why does ethnopolitical conflict sometimes lead to genocide and other times to peace? In this volume, political scientists, psychologists, sociologists, and historians examine over a dozen international cases to try to understand what causes a society's ethnic conflicts to escalate or deescalate. This unique book contains cogent critiques of the political and historical antecedents to conflict around the world, combining them with psychological analyses of group identity and intergroup conflict. 
  
---|---  
In examining the escalation of ethnic conflict, the authors highlight the
critical role of group identification. How group identification becomes
enmeshed with threatened economic resources, violent political subcultures,
and media manipulation of collective fear is stressed. The lessons from the
histories of specific countries are given cogent review: Why is Tanzania a
rare model of ethnic peace in Africa while its neighbor Rwanda houses the
worst case of ethnic warfare on the continent? How can South Africa's history
provide a positive example of the resolution of ethnopolitical tensions? This
book illustrates the promise that an interdisciplinary approach has to offer
in preventing further genocide and ethnic warfare in the 21st century.

  * At the Hands of Persons Unknown : The Lynching of Black America (2002) by Philip Dray 

  * To order: [Amazon Books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375503242/002-1821331-5983249)

  * Book Description from the Amazon.com: Lynching, the extrajudicial punishment inflicted by vigilantes and mobs on often innocent victims, was far from an unusual occurrence, though some historians have depicted it as such. Instead, writes Philip Dray, lynching was part of a "systematized reign of terror that was used to maintain the power whites had over blacks." Drawing on records held at the Tuskegee Institute, Dray argues that from 1882 until 1952, not a single year passed without a recorded lynching somewhere in the United States, most often in the Deep South and Mississippi Delta regions. This violent "justice," meted out "at the hands of persons unknown" (with, therefore, no possibility of attaching guilt to the perpetrators, though, as Dray points out, such seemingly spontaneous events required organization and planning) held African American communities in terror and was one force behind the exodus of black southerners to the north in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dray's extraordinary study reveals a pattern of crime against humanity, one that, he writes, diminished gradually for various reasons, not least of them the work of reformers and ordinary citizens "who knew we were too good to be a nation of lynchers." -- _Gregory McNamee_

  * Book Description from Amazon.com: When Chang Yu-I was three her mother tried to bind her feet. But the child's cries so tormented her brother that he convinced their mother to stop. This break with convention foreshadowed the extraordinary life Yu-i was to lead. After following her husband, poet Hsu Chi-Mo, a noted philanderer, to Oxford, she made history by becoming the first Chinese woman to have a western-style divorce at age 22. Determined to make her own way, she moved to America and served in a series of prestigious positions, including president of a bank. Written by Yu-i's great niece, Pang-Mei Natasha Chang, Bound Feet and Western Dress chronicles the life of this exceptional woman.

  * Leave None to Tell the Story: Genocide in Rwanda  (2001) by Human Rights Watch

  * To order: [Human Rights Watch](http://store.yahoo.com/hrwpubs/nonleftotels.html)

  * Book description from [HRW](http://store.yahoo.com/hrwpubs/nonleftotels.html): In 1994 a small elite chose genocide to keep power in Rwanda. They usedstate resources and authority to incite--or force--tens of thousands of Rwandans to kill the Tutsi minority. Within one hundred days, they slaughtered more thanhalf a million people, three quarters of the Tutsi of Rwanda. The major international actors, France, the U.S., Belgium, and the U.N., failed to heed the warnings of coming disaster and refused to recognize the genocide when it began. They withdrew the troops that could have saved lives and made littleprotest against the genocide, lest condemnation lead to calls for action. This study, based on Rwandan government records, dissects the deceptive discourse of genocide and shows how ordinary administrative structures and practices were turned into mechanisms of murder. It describes opposition to the killing campaign and how it was broken. In the words of survivors, it relates how they resisted and escaped. Using diplomatic and court documents, the study details the transformation of international indifference into tardy criticism. By showing how even feeble censure caused changes in the genocidal program, the study suggest what might have been the result had the world promptly and firmly cried "Never Again." .

    * Personal History (2002) by Katharine Graham 

    * To order: [Amazon Books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0375701044/qid=1013240256/sr=2-1/ref=sr_2_1/002-1821331-5983249)

    * Book Description from the Amazon.com: A remarkable book by an even more remarkable woman, Personal History recounts a life that would seem implausible in a work of fiction. Now 79, Katharine Graham, n¨¦e Meyer, grew up in a world of high privilege among the New York and Washington aristocracy. She spent her first two adult decades as the wife of Phil Graham, who had taken over the Washington Post from Katharine's father. But in August 1963, Phil's growing mental problems culminated in his suicide. A month later, Katharine took over the company--and, with virtually no prior training, built it into one of the nation's most respected news organizations. In graceful, intelligent, and bluntly honest prose, Graham provides an inside look at key events of the last few decades and offers insightful firsthand portraits of dozens of prominent figures. The most fascinating portrait, though, may be the self-portrait drawn indirectly by the author.  | ![](graham.jpg)

    * The Left Hand of Darkness(1999) by Ursula K. Le Guin 

    * To order: [Amazon Books](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441478123/qid=1013240677/sr=1-4/ref=sr_1_4/002-1821331-5983249)

    * Book Description from Amazon.com: Genly Ai is an emissary from the human galaxy to Winter, a lost, stray world. His mission is to bring the planet back into the fold of an evolving galactic civilization, but to do so he must bridge the gulf between his own culture and prejudices and those that he encounters. On a planet where people are of no gender--or both--this is a broad gulf indeed. The inventiveness and delicacy with which Le Guin portrays her alien world are not only unusual and inspiring, they are fundamental to almost all decent science fiction that has been written since. In fact, reading Le Guin again may cause the eye to narrow somewhat disapprovingly at the younger generation: what new ground are they breaking that is not already explored here with greater skill and acumen? It cannot be said, however, that this is a rollicking good story. Le Guin takes a lot of time to explore her characters, the world of her creation, and the philosophical themes that arise. -- _L. Blunt Jackson_

(1) summarize some the major trends, forces and events that have shaped the
modern world.  
(2) list and explain some basic ideas and their origins that have had global
impact.  
(3) explain how the development of modern civilization has shaped at least one

(4) describe in general terms the relationship between Europe and at least one

COURSE CALENDAR: For dates of exams, readings, assignments, etc., please see
the COURSE CALENDAR. It is subject to change. If you miss a class, be sure to
check with a classmate to see if a change was announced.

READINGS: Take a look at the course calendar. Readings are "due" 4 times
during the semester. Spread out your reading; don't try to do it all the night
before.

DISCUSSIONS: There are four DISCUSSION sessions, where we will discuss the
readings. It is absolutely essential - for your classmates as well as yourself
- that you have read the assignments well.

VIDEODISK SHOWINGS: There are four of these; all four are in Hardy Hall, room
11.

CLASS PARTICIPATION: Good class participation may lead to your grade being
"curved."

ATTENDANCE: Please see the Augusta State University absence policy (printed in
the University Catalog). Attendance will affect your grade [see section on
GRADES below].

TESTS: There will be 4 tests (see CALENDAR). Each will consist of short
essays.  The tests are not comprehensive.

DOCUMENTS: In order to help you develop your research skills, you will obtain
and summarize 3 documents during the semester. At the end of the syllabus you
will find detailed instructions.

MAKEUP TESTS: All makeup tests are given at one time -- no exceptions. Makeups
may be more difficult than the regular test.  See COURSE CALENDAR for date.

ESSAY: Toward the end of the semester, you will prepare a short essay (5-7
typed pages). At the end of this document you will find detailed instructions.

encourage you to continue to use it - particularly the slides, as they do
track what I cover in class. A list of the materials on this website:

GRADE: Your grade is based upon the 4 tests, the essay, the documents, and
attendance.  Your grade may be "curved" if your class participation is good.  
    Tests 1-4. @120 each   480   
    Essay, @ 50      50 Documents @ 20 = 60  
    TOTAL POSSIBLE    590  
************** A=550, B=470, C=390, D=300 *******************************

**DOCUMENT ASSIGNMENTS: DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS**

  
  
  

1\. HOW OFTEN. Three times.

2\. WHAT IT IS. A "document" is a written piece of work that was produced
during the time being studied.

2\. HOW TO FIND. There are three ways that you can choose documents.  
 a. You can go to the library and find books containing documents. Some books
are documents in their entirety; a memoir, for example.  
 b. Go to the DOCUMENTS page (link can be found below). You will find a series
of "links" on that page to sites that have documents.  
 c. Explore the net yourself.

4\. WHAT TO DO.  
 a. Read the document (if you have a very long one, like an entire book, just
scan it, or read one chapter or part).  
 b. Type a two-three page summary of the document, including  
  i.   Title or very brief description  
  ii.  Date of original writing/publication  
  iii. author  
  iv. a narrative  
  v. a brief commentary about any issues that you thought were raised by the
document.  

5\. WHEN TO DO IT. See COURSE CALENDAR for DUE DATES. The "Grace Date" next to
the Due Date is the LAST DAY that you can turn it in and still receive credit.

6\. WHY. Because this gives you an opportunity to look at a small slice of
history through the eyes of people who lived it, instead of text book writers
and lecturers.

7, IMPORTANT MISCELLANEOUS STUFF.

> A. Document 1 should bear some relationship to one of the following units:
A, B, or C.

>

> B. Document 2 should bear some relationship to one of the following units:
C, D, or E.

>

> C. Document 3 should bear some relationship to one of the following units:
E, F, G, or H.

>

> **D. The documents in your readings cannot be used for these assignments.**

> Based on what I have learned in this course, what is the most powerful force
that determines modern human history?

>

> Based on what I have learned in this course, what is the most important
trend in modern history?

>

have had the most imporact on how I live today?

4\. SOURCES: You essay should be based, **and based ONLY,** on the following
sources:

> * What you have learned in this course.

>

> *The two books assigned in this course.

>

> * Two (or more) library books that you consult for information. **You must
consult at least two books from our library for this essay.** Books with
primary sources (i.e. documents), memoirs, textbooks, or general histories are
good choices. Reference sources such as encyclopedias are not acceptable. _If
in doubt about the acceptability of a source, please check with me._

5\. STYLE:

> * No title page.

>

> * At the top of your first page, please put your name.

>

> * Double space your typing.

>

> * 12 point type, margins not over 1".

>

> * At the bottom of your last page (or on a separate page if necessary), list
your sources using COMPLETE CITATIONS. A COMPLETE CITATION of a book includes:
author, title, place of publication, publisher, and date of publication.

6\. TIP: Start early, and do not hesitate to contact me if something is
unclear.

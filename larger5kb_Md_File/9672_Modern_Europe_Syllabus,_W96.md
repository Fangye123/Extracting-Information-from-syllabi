**_Lecture Time/Place_** : Mon. & Wed.10 am, Angell Hall Auditorium B;
enrollment in lecture requires enrollment also in a discussion section that

Honors section.  
  
**Course Objectives:  
**_The History of Modern Europe_ shall concentrate on the key social,
political, cultural, economic and philosophical issues in European history
from the `Scientific Revolution' of the seventeenth century to the present. As
an introductory history course, this course is designed to develop not only
specific knowledge of the history of the period in question, but also to
refine skills in dealing with history and to impart a recognition that every
member of a society (including yourself) helps to `make' history. In addition,
we shall discover that there is not one, but a multitude of roots to western
culture, from the everyday life of peasant women to the perquisities of the
powerful Indeed, we shall see that culture has been constructed not by
inanimate economic, technological, or rational systems, but by `regular'
people living `normal' lives. You should note that on the assumption that many
of you are probably most interested in the later periods of this course, we'll
try to spend less time on earlier periods of history and more time on later
periods.  
  
**Course Readings:**  
Lynn Hunt, et al., _The Challenge of the West_ (Vol. 2)  
Robert Darnton, _The Great Cat Massacre_  
George Sand, _Indiana_  
Alain Corbin, _Village of the Cannibals_  
George Orwell, _Burmese Days_  
J.M. Coetzee, _Waiting for the Barbarians_  
Gregor von Rizzori, _Memoires of an Anti-Semite_  
Carolyn Kay Steedman, _Landscape for a Good Woman  
  
_**Written Assignments:**  
There will be one midterm (25%) and one final (25%) exam. In addition,
students shall write a 4-6 page paper (25%) on the topic,  "Europeans and
Africans Define Themselves and Their `Others' in the Third World," addressing
the Orwell and Coetzee works. More details will be handed out in due course.
_The 4-6 page paper is due on March 27._ **** Finally, the quality of your
participation in the sections will count for 25% of the grade. _Note_ : _A
penalty of one-half of a grade point will be assessed for each day a paper is
late_.  
  
**Attendance:**  
Roll will be taken at random five times in lecture throughout the term. You
are permitted 2 absences during random roll calls, for each absence beyond
that, you will be penalized one-half of a grade letter.  
  
**A note on academic honesty:**  
Whatever your attitudes toward material property, as future mental workers,
you must respect intellectual property. Plagiarism (the claim that the ideas
of another author are your own) and cheating are severe crimes and will be met
with a failing grade. While you are required to consult written sources and
encouraged to work with other students, you are expected to do so with high
standards of personal honesty and integrity. _Note well: we strongly urge you
to study with others in this course, but **you must turn in your own work.**_
We don't want you to submit copies of other's or a committee's work.

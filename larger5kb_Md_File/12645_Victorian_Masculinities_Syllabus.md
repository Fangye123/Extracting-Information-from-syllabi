![](Images/Tenniel_copy.jpg)This seminar will explore the complicated way in
which some nineteenth-century writers attempted to construct and stabilize the
concept of "masculinity" or "manliness." Necessarily, we will also explore a
number of writers who dedicated themselves to disrupting and challenging these
norms. The course title uses the plural, in other words, because this course
is grounded in the assumption (an easy one to demonstrate) that Victorian
culture generated a variety of different and often conflicting models of
"manliness." Moreover, these models of manliness seem to play increasingly
important roles in a wide variety of important social and cultural movements
over the course of the century, from the emergence of a middle class
patriarchy to the development of feminist consciousness to the creation of the
Aestheticist movement. We will be reading many different types of texts --
poetry, prose, and novels; some written by men, some by women -- and will
attempt to survey this topic in as much of its variety as we can. The course
will cover such topics as the following: "The Dandy," "Middle Class
Earnestness," "Muscular Christians," "The Dandy-Aesthete," "Imperial
Manliness," "Post-Darwinian Man," "The Man in the Closet." Readings will be
drawn from, among others: Carlyle, the Brontes, Kingsley, the Rossettis,
Pater, Wilde, Kipling, and Symonds. Supplemental readings will be drawn
primarily from the work of Michel Foucault and Judith Butler, but we will also
be paying some degree of attention to the ideas of Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick,
Richard Dellamora, Herbert Sussman, James Eli Adams, Linda Dowling, J. A.
Mangan, and others. Requirements include 3 papers for undergraduates; 4 for
graduate students ([Topics for Paper

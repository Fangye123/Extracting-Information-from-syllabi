**The Course**

> This course is an introduction to the history and civilization of Europe and
the Mediterranean area in the middle ages. The emphasis is on the dissolution
of the classical Greco-Roman world into three kindred civilizations,
Byzantium, Islam, and Latin Christendom; the formation of a new civilization
in the West; and the beginning of the eventual rise to world predominance of
the West.  
>

**Reading and Texts**

> Students are **required** to do a certain amount of assigned reading outside
class. The reading for this course comes in two forms - articles on reserve
and documents available on the World Wide Web. By the end of the course
students should be able to evaluate for themselves both source material from
the past and the varied interpretations given to the to those sources. There
is a required textbook, but students' primary responsibility is to read and
discuss primary source assignments. The textbook (with a new edition for this
semester - do not buy older editions) is -

> > Hollister, C. Warren, _Medieval Europe: A Short History_ , 8th ed. (New
York: McGraw-Hill, 1998)

**Sources and Other Readings on the World Wide Web**

> All the source readings for each class are on the _**World Wide Web**_. If
you are reading the online version of this syllabus all you need do is to
select [often by  "clicking"] the texts in question, which are listed under
each class. You can then read on screen, or print out the document. [For the
computer-phobic copies may be made available in the library reserve room.]
This option puts you, as Fordham students, on the cutting edge of technology.

>

> The Internet is now a valuable research tool for students. Accordingly I
shall also make this syllabus, course outline, lecture notes, and other class
handouts available on the _ **Web**_. Under each class there may also be
reading material (marked as such), gathered from various **WWW Extra** sites.
This material addresses or expands upon issues overlooked in the assigned
readings.

>

> You must acquire a CIMS account for this semester. To do this go to the VAX
terminal room in Dealy and complete the online application procedure. You can
pick up your account in the CIMS office in Dealy Basement the next day. You
can access this account from any VAX terminal at Fordham, from the new net
terminals, from terminals in the library, and from home if you have a modem.

>

> In Mulcahy Hall, in Walsh Library, and in Dealy Hall there are "graphical
terminals" \- both Mac, IBM, and VAX Xwindows - which have the impressive
_**Netscape**_ Web browser. To access the class page from Netscape, just type
in (at the prompt):

**http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/medieval.html**

> On the older VAX terminals at Fordham, there is also a non-graphical, but
very fast, web browser is called LYNX. To invoke the "pages" for this course
simple sign on and type

notice from the Athletic Director presented before the class to be missed.

>

* * *

**Course _ **Outline**_  
**

> The course is based on eight thematic sections of varying length through
which we shall analyze the formation of the medieval world. The eight sections
are:-

  * The End of the Classical World
  * Byzantium
  * Islam
  * The Formation of Latin Christendom
  * The Rebirth of Latin Christendom
  * The Civilization of the West in the High Middle Ages
  * Byzantium and Islam Face the West
  * The Later Middle Ages

> In general we shall do one "class" per class meeting. To allow some
flexibility, however, I will not assign classes to specific dates. You will
know what to read next by where we are in the course.  
>

>

> **NOTES ON THE COURSE OUTLINE**

>

>   * **Lecture** \- Lecture notes for each class are available. These
correspond in some way to what happens in class. For review purposes the
_**topics**_ given under each class should be used.

>   * **Textbook readings** in Hollister are to page numbers in _Medieval
Europe: A Short History_ , 8th ed.

>   * **Map** links to an online color map related to the lecture..

>   * **Sources** are indicated by title - for instance the _Passion of St.
Perpetua_ **.** You can access the source simply by selecting [ "clicking"] on
it. All sources for a particular lecture will be available under the title
**Halsall: Lecture 1** ( **2, 3, 4** , etc) the library reserve room.

>   * It would be best for you to read ALL the primary source readings.
However, they are marked according to priority:  
>  ![RED](images/redsq.gif) RED means the text MUST BE READ **BEFORE CLASS**.  
>  ![YELLOW ](images/yellowcirc.gif) YELLOW means it might make more sense to
read this text after class  
>  ![GREEN ](images/greentri.gif) GREEN means the text is optional.

>   * References to _**WWW Reading**_ refer to reading available via the World
Wide Web. I expect you to show awareness of some of these readings during the
semester.  
>   * References to _**WWW Extra**_ refer to optional reading available via
the World Wide Web

>   * References to _**WWW Link**_ refer to World Wide Web sites related to
the class topics. Remember that a much fuller list of [Medieval Links on the
World Wide Web](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/medweb/) is also available.

**_Course Description_**

While interstate war has been a relatively rare occurrence in the past 185
years there have been eight major military conflicts in the Middle East since
the creation of Israel in 1948. This unhappy recent history provides scholars
of international relations an unique opportunity to explore and begin to
understand the factors that make war between states more or less likely. This
is the tack that we will take in this class, examining the history of the
Middle East since the end of the Second World War as a way to understand
better the role of military conflict in world politics generally and in the
creation of the modern Middle East specifically.

Scholars of international relations have argued over the impact of arms races,
alliances, relative capabilities and the influence of great powers on the
probability of states resorting to military force to settle disputes. Other
questions include whether a state can deter another state (and whether we can
tell if deterrence is taking place) and whether states "learn" from past
experience. We will trace the antecedents of the various Middle East wars to
determine what lessons about war in the international system can be learned.
As a result, the class will start with a brief survey of Middle Eastern
history prior to the creation of Israel and the independence of the various
Arab states before progressing through the wars between Israel and her Arab
neighbors and culminating in the two Persian Gulf Wars - the two major Middle
Eastern wars not to involve Israel. We will then examine a series of different
issues important to the study of international military conflict to determine
what impact these issues may have had on the wars in the Middle East.

**_Course Requirements_**

The format of the class will largely be discussion, with a minimum of
lecturing. Many of the class meetings will start off with the provision of
definitions and a general discussion of concepts in the reading before turning
to an application of those concepts to the particular case or cases being
considered. As a result, it is critical that you come to class having
completed the reading ahead of time and that you take some time to mull over
the readings and consider any implications of events discussed for the
concepts being examined.

The quickest and most reliable way to contact me if you have a question is
through email. I will also be using email to disseminate information to the
class. As this class is based largely on discussion - and participation makes
up a sizable chunk of your grade - you are expected to come to class each day
prepared to contribute. In addition, certain norms of behavior are expected. I
understand that discussing events in the Middle East is often with fraught
with controversy and emotion and, as a result, it is sometimes easy to slip
into ad hominem attacks. Such behavior will not be tolerated and will
adversely affect your grade. If you have any problems with the class, or with
some of the material, make sure you come and talk to me. Waiting until the end
of the semester will only make it more difficult to resolve any problems that
may occur.

The breakdown of the grading for the classis as follows:  
Class participation -- 25 percent  
Midterm -- 15 percent  
Paper -- 25 percent  
Final exam -- 35 percent

The grade for class participation depends on students' preparation for, and
participation in, the class, performance on various quizzes and think piece
papers, and attendance. Think pieces are brief papers incorporating a specific
topic on the syllabus and/or a major current event in the Middle East.
Specific directions will be handed out with the assignment and page limits
will be strictly enforced. The idea is not to write a great deal on a subject
but to describe and explain an event concisely and accurately. Quizzes may or
may not be announced in advance, though careful preparation and steady
attendance should make the quizzes not a problem for anyone. The one quiz that
is announced in advance is the Map Quiz - this quiz will be held next week and
requires that you can identify the states and state capitals, as well as major
bodies of water, in the Middle East.

Both the midterm and the final exam will be in-class and will include a
combination of short identifications and essays. The midterm will take place
after we complete our survey of the history of the Middle East. The final exam
will be comprehensive. The major paper will most likely involve an in-depth
examination on your part of a major event in Middle Eastern politics over the
past fifty years and how that event can provide us with answers to questions
of importance in the study of world politics. More details on the paper will
be provided. NO EXTENSIONS will be granted for papers. You will be informed of
all assignments well in advance, so good planning and time management skills
will benefit you. Assignments must be handed to me before the start of class
on the day they are due. Late papers will suffer a penalty of a letter grade
per day it is late [e.g. A to B etc ].

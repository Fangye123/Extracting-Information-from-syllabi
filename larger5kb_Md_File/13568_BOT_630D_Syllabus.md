**BOT 630W Objectives:**

To provide teachers with an intensive and broad experience with respect to
knowledge of trees (Dendrology).  This experience will include identification,
distribution, and utilization of native and introduced trees and their
products.  Teachers will customize a [MUDES
CD](http://www.cas.muohio.edu/~meicenrd/mudes/mudes.htm) and develop lesson
plans for incorporation of it into their own individual curricula as an
independent project during the course.  Please consult the [Ohio Educational
Department Science Learning
Outcomes](http://www.cas.muohio.edu/~meicenrd/BOT630/WSI/odelscienceearningoutcomes.html)
for your grade level(s) to begin contemplation of your project.

Objectives
In this course, we will examine the major myths of the Greeks and
Romans, and study the origins, impact on classical culture
(literature and art), and lasting effect of classical mythology on
later civilization. We will approach our study primarily through
Greek and Roman literature and iconography. Greek legends and stories
have held a tremendous fascination for humankind since they were
first told. Their civilization has a unique way of speaking to us.
Our first job will be to peel back the levels of history to get back
at what the ancients really thought about mythology. Our second focus
will be on that relationship between the ancients and us; that will
be dealt with in the final project.
 
Texts
The basic text book (Morford & Lenardon) contains
extended quotes from several authors, and also contains useful
background material for the literature assignments. The major authors
that we will read are (those marked with an asterisk * are in ML):
Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Hesiod, Homer, Homeric Hymns*,
Plato*, Vergil, Ovid*, & Lucian*, and from the post-classical
period the French author Racine.
Since classical mythology affected art in addition to literature,
many class presentations will be accompanied by images (snaned
images, some slides, Perseus images, etc.) of ancient and
post-ancient art. One of the goals of the course is to provide the
tools necessary for a student to recognize myths and characters in
art.
Requirements

Exams. There will be three exams during the semester
   (dates given in schedule below). Each exam will include objective
   questions (for example, fill in the blank), slide identifications
   (the myths or characters represented), and short essays. Please
   note that make-up exams are the rare exception, not the
   rule, and are allowed at the discretion of the instructor;
   such matters must be arranged in advance of the regularly
   scheduled exam time.
Paper. The
   paper, 10-15 pages in length, is to be on a work of literature
   (ancient or post-ancient) that makes extensive use of classical
   myth (a work that is not otherwise assigned as one of the course
   readings). More detailed instructions and advice will be provided
   later in the semester. The paper must be written using with a
   word processing program. Help with Microsoft Word (DOS,
   Windows, and Mac versions) will be provided by the instructor on
   request. Deadlines are for the rough and for the final drafts
   respectively, and are noted in the schedule below. Deadlines
   are firm, and penalties will be assessed for each day late
   (one day ends, and another begins, at 5:00 p.m.): rough
   draft, 5 points per day off final paper grade; final draft, 10
   points per day off final paper grade. Your instructor is cold and
   cruel, and very strict about these matters.
Final project. Each
   student will prepare a final project, due on December 11 (11:30
   a.m.). The project is to focus on the connection between classical
   mythology and related area(s) of learning, for example "Medea and
   the demonization of feminists in contemporary society,"
   "Prometheus and the Voyager Mission: Creation Tales and
   Anthropomorphism," "Crossing the River Styx and the Big Chill,"
   "George Washington as Zeus," "Palaestra and Pedagogy." The project
   consists of an annotated bibliography.
Class participation, attendance. The final factor is
   class participation/attendance. The normal expectation is that
   students will be at every class, for one cannot participate in
   absentia! Participation also involves preparation of homework
   assignments before class. Participation will be assessed not so
   much on quantity as on quality.
   
   Students should feel free to express their own opinions on
   various matters related to the course and to ask questions.
   Students' interpretations need not necessarily be the same as
   those of the instructor. As long as interpretations are based upon
   reasoned assessments of the evidence (literary, historical,
   archaeological), they are as valid as the instructor's.
This concept has been reinforced through cooperative work of SU
   students and faculty, which resulted in a provision of the SU
   Academic Rights for Students. It bears repeating here:

Faculty members should encourage free thought and
      expression both in the classroom and out. Students are entitled
      to disagree with interpretation of data or views of a faculty
      member and reserve judgment in matters of opinion, but this
      disagreement does not excuse them from learning the content of
      any course for which they are enrolled or from demonstrating
      skills and competencies required by a faculty member. Students
      should be evaluated solely on academic performance.

Accommodations for students with
disabilities:
SU will make reasonable accommodations for peresons with
documented disabilities. Students should register with the Office of
Academic Services, located in Mood-Bridwell 311. Professors must be
notified that documentation is on file no later than the end of the
second week of class for the accommodation to be honored.
Final Grades.
The plus and minus grading system, now in effect at
   Southwestern, will be used for final grades. Semester % averages
   will translate to the following letter grades:

Daily routine
Syllabus. You should check this syllabus 
   on-line at least once before each class assignment.
   With various resources coming on-line, this document is a fluid
   work, and each student is responsible for changes and corrections
   to the syllabus.
   
   Several assignments are accesible through "hot links" on this
   syllabus. Click on the link in the right hand column of the daily
   assignments below to be connected to the homework source. Hot
   links usually appear underlined and in blue or purple; in the
   hardcopy of this syllabus, the links are underlined.
"Handouts". Each day in class, instead of handing out
   hard copies of the day's technical terms, names, dates, maps,
   etc., the "handout" will be projected in the classroom. You are
   strongly encouraged to access the handouts on the Web.
You can access the handout in three ways:

click on the date in the syllabus schedule below (you will
      be able to tell whether I have created the handout by the "hot
      link" convention for the date, usually blue or purple in
      Netscape)
access the handouts directly. The convention that I use is
      (without the quotes) "mythdate.html". For example, the
      file for the handout for September 23 would be "myth0923.html".
      The full location address is:

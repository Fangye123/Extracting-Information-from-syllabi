# **III. Purpose of the Course**

The purpose of this course is to introduce students to innovative and
effective technology for the mathematics classroom. Hands-on experiences will
be provided using computers, calculators, digital cameras and other resources
used to effectively teach mathematics.

  
**IV. UNIT CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK**  
**A.** The professional education unit at The University of Mississippi is
committed to preparing reflective professional leaders for the state, region,
and nation. Undergraduate and graduate programs in the professional education
unit offer learning experiences that promote the acquisition of knowledge,
skills, and dispositions to facilitate lifelong learning in an interactive and
diverse society. The unit provides research-based experiences infused with
technology as a teaching and learning tool. The foundation of the conceptual
framework is composed of three knowledge bases designed to prepare "Counselors
as Enablers," "Leaders for the 21st Century, and "Teachers as Facilitators."

# **Assignments  
  
****Teacher Web Page 1 80 points  
  
**Each student will be required to construct a teacher web page on
TeacherWeb.com. The web page address must be emailed to the instructor on the
last day of class. The page will consist of the minimum requirements:  

  
_Teacher Page  
_ Brief personal bio (5 points)  
One paragraph Personal Philosophy of Teaching Mathematics (5 points)  
  
_Reflection: Technology in the Math Classroom  
_One page reflection on how the technology should be used educationally inside
and outside the mathematics classroom. Remember, this should be how you feel
about this subject as it relates to your experiences. (20 points)  
  
_Math Tricks  
_ Each student is required to provide 2 math tricks on their site. Each trick
must be clearly explain and include the following: Title of the trick,
intended grade level(s), needed technology (if any), and solution. (10 points
for each trick)  
  
_Five educational websites.  
_ Your web page will include 5 mathematics education websites which will
includethe name of the site, the correct URL (web address), and a description
of the site. These sitesshould be your best of the best that you have
discovered during this course. You may use only 2 sites that we have used in
this course. (20 points)  
  
_Course Reflection Journal_  
Each student will complete a daily reflection of how the days activities have
affected your thoughts of using the technology in the mathematics classroom.
At the end of each class, the student will add to their overall journal page.
(60 points)  
  
_Mathematics Activity/Lesson  
  
_ Each student will develop 1 mathematics lesson that infuses the use of
technology. The goal of this assignment is to have each student apply
technology to a lesson that they have previously done or seen done in a
classroom without the use of technology. The activity/lesson must demonstrate
how technology enhances the overall lesson for the teaching and learning of
mathematics. The activity/lesson must include at least the following
information: Title, intended grade level, Learning objective(s), materials
used, lesson procedures (or outline), closure/wrap-up, and possible
assessment. (50 points) ****  
  
**In-class activities 2 0 points each  
**Each student will be required to complete in-class activities during the
course.  
  
**  
B. Attendance Policy**

Attendance and participation in class are expected. An excessive number of
absences will adversely affect the final grade for the course. (See _Class
Attendance_ policy on page 10 of **The University of Mississippi M Book**.)

**  
C. Policies Related to Students with Disabilities  
** It is the responsibility of any student with a disability, who requests a
reasonable accommodation, to contact the Office of Student Disability Services
(915-7128). Contact will then be made by that office to the instructor of this
class. The instructor will then be happy to work with the student so that a
reasonable accommodation of any disability can be made.

  
**D. Evaluation Procedure  
** Grades will be given based on student performance on all items listed in
the Course Requirements. Letter grades will be determined by using the
following scale:  
  

A 92% - 100%  
B 83% - 91%  
C 74% - 82%  
D 65% - 73%  
  
All assignments and examination should be must completed on the announced due
dates. Any assignments not turned in by the due date will result in a zero
unless approved by the instructor prior to the due date.

  
**E. Instructional Strategies  
** The course will include lectures, class discussions, demonstrations,
modeling, hands-on computer-based activities, students presentations, and

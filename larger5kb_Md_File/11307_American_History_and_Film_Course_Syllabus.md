Course Description: This course examines twentieth-century American culture
and society through film. The primary text for this course will be American
films such as City Lights, Casablanca, The Graduate, Apocalypse Now, Wall
Street, and American Beauty. We will critically analyze how American cultural
and social conflicts are portrayed and worked out in popular films. By
watching, discussing, and writing about these films, we will examine how
motion pictures create a window into modern American society. Students will
learn how to read American films as cultural texts that help us better
understand our history and culture.

Course Objective: The larger goal of this course is to teach students how to
critically analyze and evaluate films as cultural texts that open up a window
into American society.  
The primary form of cultural and historical analysis we will do in this class
will involve students writing critical film reviews. A good film review
examines both how a film works and how and why it affects the viewer the way
it does. We will learn how to use popular American films to understand
competing perspectives on American history, culture, and society. If you
disagree with an argument or perspective, or find it biased or limited, then
say so. If you find the reading difficult, confused, or pointless, then say
so. But, in each case, you must be prepared to support your argument and
larger conclusions.

Required Reading:

S. Mintz and R. Roberts, eds. , Hollywood's America: U.S. History through its
. . . . . Films, 2nd edition.  
John Moscowitz, Critical Approaches to Writing about Film

Class Format: A major portion of this class will involve watching and
critically analyzing films. Wednesdays will be our film screening days, with
class running from 3:00 to 6:00 p.m. On Mondays we will discuss and critically
analyze the films we have seen. Students will be required to write critical
"film reviews" of the movies we see . Since a major part of this class is
watching and critically reviewing films, attendance is critical.

Daily assignments and quizzes: Because attendance is so important in this
class, I will take regular attendance. I will periodically have pop-quizzes on
the reading about the films. Most of the daily work for this course will
involve writing critical film reviews of the movies we see.

Exams: There will be a take-home midterm and final in this class. The exams
will ask students to critically analyze and contrast these films' competing
perspectives on American society and culture. Students will discover that the
more notes they take and the more thoughtfully they review these films the
easier it will be for them to write the midterm and final exams.

Film Reviews: Out of the 14 movies we watch this semester, students will be
required to write 5 film reviews ( 2-3 pages each). Out of the five film
reviews, I will throw out the lowest grade, so that students will get credit
for four film reviews. As long as their film reviews are turned in at the time
they were first due, students will be allowed to revise their reviews
throughout the entire semester for a higher grade. In order to provide a model
for writing these film reviews, I have assigned Critical Approaches to writing
about Film by John Moscowitz. Film reviews will be graded on how well they
critically analyze how a movie works and how it examines larger cultural and
social issues in American history and society. You are required to write at
least two film reviews before the midterm is due (Oct. 30).

Grading: Grades will be based on quizzes and class participation (10%), film
reviews (40%), a take-home midterm (20%), and a take-home final (30%). I
reserve the right to give unannounced quizzes and assignments in class.
Content will count most heavily in all written work, but grammar, spelling,
and style will also affect your grade.

Course grades will be defined in these terms:

A--Excellent--( Thoughtful, coherent, insightful, contributes)

B--Good--( Knows material well, lacks depth, not outstanding)

C--Fair--( Adequate, average, passing, little participation)

D--Poor--( Little understanding, little effort, incoherent)

F--Fail--( No evidence of understanding, no work, no learning)

Incompletes: I will be very reluctant to give a grade of Incomplete (I). I
assign incompletes only to students who have successfully completed most of
the course work and who have been prevented by significant and unanticipated
circumstances from finishing all of their assignments.

University Honor Code: As citizens of an academic community of trust, CU-
Boulder students do not lie or cheat whether they are on campus or acting as
representatives of the  
University of Colorado in the surrounding communities. Neither should they
suffer by the dishonest acts of others.

The University of Colorado has adopted a Student Honor Code. See the website
at:  
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html. The University of Colorado has
also adopted a code of student behavior for classrooms. See the website at:
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html. Students are responsible
to honor the Student Honor Code and Classroom Behavior Code. Please go to
these two websites to read these codes and to understand the Student Honor
Code at CU-Boulder.

As faculty, students, and members of the University community, we value honor,
integrity, and morality. Honor is about academic integrity, moral and ethical
conduct, and pride of membership in a community that values academic
achievement and individual responsibility. Cultivating honor lays the
foundation for lifelong integrity, developing in each of us the courage and
insight to make difficult choices and accept responsibility for actions and
their consequences, even at personal cost.

Students with Disabilities: I encourage students with disabilities, including
non-visible disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning disabilities, head
injury, attention deficit/hyperactive disorder, and psychiatric disabilities,
to discuss with me after class or during my office hours appropriate
accommodations. If you have any additional questions about how the University
can accommodate your disability, please see me or the Coordinator of
Disability Services in the Disability Services Office, 322 Willard Hall,
(303-492-8671). If you qualify for accommodations because of a disability,
please submit to me a letter from Disability Services early in the semester so
that your needs may be addressed. Disability Services determines
accommodations based on documented disabilities (303-492-8671, Willard 322).
See the Disability Services website: www.colorado.edu/sacs/disabilityservices.

Religious Obligations and Class Attendance: If you have conflicts with
scheduled exams, assignments, or other required attendance, because of
religious obligations, please notify me two weeks in advance of the conflict
to request special accommodation. See the CU Policy at this website:
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html  
  
Cheating and Plagiarism: My policy on cheating and plagiarism is to assign a
zero to the work in question. Plagiarism is copying another person's work and
turning it in as your own. Plagiarism can involve buying a "class paper"
online, copying another student's work, or copying whole paragraphs and
material from other sources, such as encyclopedias or textbooks. See the
website for the Pledge not to Plagiarize:
http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/Code.html.

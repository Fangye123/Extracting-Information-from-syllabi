##  Overview

This course is centered on the definition, use, and implementation of abstract
data structures such as stacks, queues, hash tables, trees, sets, and graphs.
Implementations will use an object-oriented programming language. Techniques
to estimate the efficiency of common algorithms for each data structure will
also be examined.  
  

## Objectives

  * Students will be able to design and implement object-oriented solutions to software requirements that require 1,000-5,000 lines of source code.
  * Students will be able to solve complex problems involving the following abstract data types: dynamic arrays, stacks, queues, lists, sets, trees, graphs, and hash tables.
  * Students will be able to quantitatively analyze the time and space needed for algorithms related to the above data types.
  * Students will be able to learn about and incorporate libraries from the Java Application Programmer's Interface into their programs when necessary.

##  Requirements

**Prerequisites:** CMSC142 (If you have had CMSC142 with Dr. Thomas, please
see me before enrolling in this course.)

**Required Text:** _Data Structures and Algorithms in Java_ ( _Second Edition_
),  
by Goodrich and Tamassia  

  * This text is absolutely essential to the course. There is a related Web site at  http://www.cs.brown.edu/courses/cs016/book/

---|---  
  
**Recommended Reference Text:** _Java: How to Program_ (Fourth Edition),  
by Deitel and Deitel  

  * This is a good reference text; it will be indispensible if you are new to Java.

**Coursework:**

This class and its associated lab will be organized around a series of
increasingly complex programming projects that require the student to
implement and use the most important data structures. During most class
meetings students will work in small groups presenting and refining their
solutions to the current project. Each week groups will present their current
progress and all members of the class will respond to these presentations. I
will define the scope of projects, assign groups, facilitate group
interactions, chair class meetings, and lecture when necessary. Attendance is
crucial to this process of group inquiry and is mandatory.

**Grading:** Final grades are weighted according to the table. Project grades
include participation scores made by group members and the instructor. The
Final Exam will be comprehensive.  

Laboratories |  10%  
---|---  
Projects  
|  40%  
MidTerm Exam  
|  20%  
Final Exam |  30%  
  
**Laboratory:** Directed instruction while on the computer is an integral part
of the course. Lab work will complement class discussions and help you
complete projects.

**Projects:** are usually handed in electronically and are due by 5p.m. on the
due date indicated in the Course Calendar.. Unexcused late assignments are
penalized.

**Computer Access:** Java and the Java Development Kit (jdk) are ubiquitous
and available for nearly every operating system. We will primarily use the
systems in the Albee Computer Lab (Albee 100).

**Cooperative Learning:**  

> 1) You must work independently on all exams.  
>

> 2) I encourage students to discuss and work together on labs and
assignments. However, do not copy solutions, programs, or code fragments from
other students. Copied code will receive no credit and will be treated as a
case of scholastic dishonesty.

**On-Line Information:** Class announcements, assignments, solutions, labs,
and helpful information will usually be available on the World Wide Web at at
inside.bard.edu/~sanderso/cmsc201.

**Linux:** In order to work effectively you will need to become familiar with
the Linux operating system.

  * A Linux reference will be made available.  

**Disclaimer:** This syllabus is intended to suggest the outline of the
course; it is not absolute. Changes to the syllabus, should they occur, will
be announced in class.

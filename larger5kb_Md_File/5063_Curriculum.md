_Dakota State University Curriculum_

##  **Curriculum**

**Course Delivery and Scheduling  **  
At DSU, academic coursework challenges a student beyond listening well, taking
good notes, and preparing for examinations. The faculty at DSU uses current
technology to communicate information, to share ideas, and to measure a
student's learning against the published course expectations. Students have
access to faculty outside the classroom via electronic mail, by phone, or in
person during office hours.  
  
**Graduation Requirements  **

**Baccalaureate Degrees  **  
Graduation requirements for baccalaureate degrees are grouped into three
categories with identified goals and a list of courses that meet designated
goals in each category:

| System-wide General Education Requirements  |  30 credits  
---|---  
Institutional Graduation Requirements |  5 credits  
Information Technology Literacy Requirements  | _9 credits  _  
Total |  44 credits  
  
All students should check their major before selecting any general education
course.  
  
**System-wide General Education Requirements  **  
The system-wide general education curriculum of the university is intended to
provide opportunities for the student to develop the breadth and depth of
understanding and appreciation which characterizes the educated and
responsible adult. Courses which deal with language and symbolic thought,
literature and aesthetic values, natural sciences, and the social sciences are
an integral dimension of one's personal, community, and professional life. All
degree programs of the university include system-wide general education
requirements. Students should check major-field requirements before selecting
courses to meet the system-wide general education requirements.  
  
**Goals of System-wide General Education Requirements  **  
Students will:

  1. write effectively and responsibly and understand and interpret the written  
expression of others.

  2. communicate effectively and responsibly through speaking and listening. 
  3. understand the structures and possibilities of the human community through  
study of the social sciences.

  4. understand and appreciate the human experience through arts and  
humanities.

  5. understand and apply fundamental mathematical processes and reasoning. 
  6. understand the fundamental principles of the natural sciences and apply  
scientific methods of inquiry to investigate the natural world.

  7. understand and be sensitive to cultural diversity so that they are prepared to  
live and work in an international and multicultural environment.

**Entry-Level Assessment  **  
It is the policy of Dakota State University to assess the basic academic
skills of all incoming, degree-seeking students. All incoming students seeking
an associate or baccalaureate degree must provide valid Enhanced ACT scores or
must complete the ACT COMPASS examination in the areas of reading, writing,
and mathematics. Students also complete a written computing skills test.
Students are required to enroll in the initial English or math coursework
indicated by their scores on the Enhanced ACT or the ACT COMPASS exam. All
courses which are prerequisites to general education courses must be completed
within the first 24 credit hours attempted. Students may retake the COMPASS
exam one time. Students do not receive academic credit for any English or
mathematics course based on his/her Enhanced ACT or ACT COMPASS scores.  
  
**Mathematics:** If prescribed by entry-level assessment, students must
successfully complete MATH 021 and/or MATH 101 before taking general education
mathematics. MATH 021 credits do not count toward graduation.  
  
**Writing:** If prescribed by entry-level assessment, students must
successfully complete ENGL 031-032-033 before taking general education English
courses.  
ENGL 031-032-033 credits do not count toward graduation.  
  
**Reading:** If prescribed by entry-level assessment, students must
successfully complete LART 110, which includes a one-credit section on reading
and a two-credit section on study skills.  
  
**Transfer students** who have not completed the equivalent of ENGL 101 and
MATH 102 must provide the required Enhanced ACT scores or take the ACT COMPASS
examination in the area(s) in which they have not taken course(s).  
  
**Returning students** will have their academic skills status reviewed as a
consideration for readmission.  
  
**Non-degree seeking students** enrolling in English or mathematics courses
must provide the Enhanced ACT scores or complete the ACT COMPASS exam in the
areas of writing and/or mathematics.  
  
**General Education Assessment  **  
General education assessment activities are held on assessment day, generally
scheduled during the first two weeks in November and again during the last two
weeks in March. All daytime classes are canceled for these assessment
activities. All students who have completed 48 credit hours above the
100-level and who meet the additional criteria specified in BOR Policy 2:28
must participate in assessment activities. Students who do not participate in
the assessment process will be denied subsequent registration at all regental
institutions. Additional specifications for readmission, remediation, and
accommodations can be found in BOR Policy 2:28.  
  
**Student Proficiency Examination  **  
Effective Spring 1998, satisfactory performance on the proficiency examination
is required for all students seeking a baccalaureate degree from the South
Dakota Unified System of Higher Education. Effective Fall 1999, satisfactory
performance on the proficiency examination will be required for all incoming
students seeking an associate degree from the South Dakota Unified System of
Higher Education. Effective Fall 2000, all incoming students seeking an
associate or baccalaureate degree from DSU must satisfactorily complete the
Information Technology Literacy Exam. Enrolled students who have already
earned a baccalaureate degree are exempt from these requirements. Additional
specifications for proficiency testing can be found in BOR policy 2:28.
Students who do not complete the proficiency exam requirements cannot continue
registration at the university.  
  
Effective Fall 1999, incoming freshmen must complete 30 hours of system-wide
general education courses in their first 64 credit hours. The system-wide
general education core courses which students must have completed, or
currently be enrolled in, to sit for the proficiency exam include:

**Board of Regent Requirements** | **DSU Courses  ** |

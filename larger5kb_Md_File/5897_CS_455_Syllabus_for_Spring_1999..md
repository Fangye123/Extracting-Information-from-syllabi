##  CS 455 on the World Wide Web

  * Current information about this course, including lecture slides when available, will be accessible on the CS 455 [web page](http://www.cs.gmu.edu/~simon/cs455-simon.html).

##  Course Description:

  * CS455 presents data communications fundamentals and computer networking methods, using a layered reference model to organize the study. We will focus primarily on the data link, network, and transport layers, along with protocols for real-time and multimedia networking. We will finish up with a discussion of network security. Students will program simplified versions of the protocols as part of the course project. There will also be periodic homework assignments. 

**Internet-based Course Delivery**

*CS 455 Section 02 will make use of an internet-based course delivery system called CLASSWISE. Classes will be available on computer desktops at home or office by using regular Internet connections. System requirements are a multimedia Pentium computer with Microsoft Windows 95 or later and Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 or later, and a 28.8kbps or better modem. Instructor's voice, slides, and slide annotations are delivered to the student's desktop; students   
can ask questions via text input. Classes are recorded as delivered and can be
played back through the same setup. A password is required to access online
delivery and playback of classes. To request a password, send to
help@netlab.gmu.edu an email that states you are in Dr.Simon's CS455 and gives
your GMU account ID.

* **SOFTWARE AND INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING CLASSWISE IS AT<http://netlab.gmu.edu/disted>**

*Please note:This option is also available for Section 1 students

* _All exams will still need to_ _be taken in class at the appropriate times!_

**Prerequisites** :

  * Grade of C or better in CS310 and CS365, and either STAT 344 or MATH 351.

##  Project:

  * We will use the Network Workbench, a collection of modules developed in the GMU Center for the New Engineer that simulate a protocol stack and display the results, using a text. You will create modules for Data Link Control, Network and Transport layers and run them in the Workbench environment. 

##  Examination Rules:

  * The [GMU honor code](http://www.gmu.edu/catalog/acadpol6.html) and the [CS honor code](http://cs.gmu.edu/honor-code.html) apply and will be **_vigorously_** enforced.   Further, _no early exams will be offered_.    If you must miss an exam then you must provide a written, verifiable excuse. No makeup exams will be offered until your excuse is verified.

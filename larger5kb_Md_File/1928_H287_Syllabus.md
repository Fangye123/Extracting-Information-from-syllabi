###  
Course Description

For a whole generation of men and women on both sides of the conflict, the
Vietnam War remains the defining event of their lives, as World War I, the
Great Depression or World War II did for earlier generations. While
policymakers continue to debate the "lessons of Vietnam," ordinary Americans
and Vietnamese are still learning to come to terms with the impact of the war
on their personal lives. As recent scholarship makes clear, the Vietnam war
was an extremely complex phenomenon in which a struggle for decolonization and
social revolution became enmeshed in the Cold War. Vietnam thus became both
pawn and symbol of superpower politics. As U.S. relations with the Soviet
Union and China changed, so did rationales for continued American involvement
in the war from the containment of communism to the pursuit of credibility.
The causes of the communist insurgency in Vietnam were similarly complex and
changing. The use of powerful new technology by one side and of guerrilla
warfare by the other raised serious ethical questions. Finally, the war
coincided with domestic turmoil in the United States and, in Vietnam, led to
the displacement of huge numbers of people and strained the social fabric.  
  
This course seeks to present a balanced and comprehensive picture of both
Vietnamese and American perspectives on the war including the geopolitical
concerns that informed decisionmaking, the motivation and domestic appeal of
the Vietnamese communists and their indigenous opponents and the experiences
of individual men and women who fought in Vietnam or became the war's hapless
victims.

### Course Requirements

**Lectures and Discussion Sections.** Attendance at lectures and participation
in discussions are required. Weekly readings will call upon students to use
and evaluate both primary and secondary source materials that offer a variety
of Vietnamese and American perspectives on the war.  
  
  
**Use of the Internet.** The internet is an integral part of this course. It
will be used in two ways:

  * The World Wide Web pages for this course are designed to provide you with on-line access to much of your required reading, including primary documents, maps, articles and photographs. For information on gaining access to these materials, click here.   
  

  * Students will also participate in on-line discussion groups to prepare for their weekly section meetings. During the course of the semster, each student will moderate the on-line discussion for one week's set of readings and discussion for their section. This will include sending out on e-mail a list of at least three discussion questions based on the week's reading and moderating the responses of your classmates to the questions you pose. All students are expected to contribute to the weekly on-line discussions on a regular basis. For more information on how to participate in on-line discussions, click [here](OnLineDisIntro.html). 
  
Don't worry if you haven't had a lot of experience with the internet. Your
first section meeting will introduce you to the skills necessary for using the
internet in this course. For that week only discussion sections will meet at
their regular times for a "hands-on" workshop in N234C in the School of
Business Administration Building. This room is equiped with computer terminals
for each student. Students who do not yet have an e-mail account at UWM must
get one prior to the their first section meetings. They can do so by attending
one of many drop-in sessions organized by Information and Media Technologies
in Bolton 245 during the first week of school. The schedule for these drop-in
sessions will be announced in class.  
  
  
**Course Essay.** Students will write an essay of ten typewritten pages that
explores a particular issue or theme in the history of the Vietnam war. You
should choose a topic of special interest to you. Papers can be based on a
wide variety of sources, including scholarly works about the war, memoirs of
diplomats and soliders, and/or imaginative accounts of the war such as novels,
poetry, painting and film. The best bibliography of writings on the Vietnam
War is available on-line. To go to that bibliography, click [
here](bibliography.html). Another very useful and readily available source is
the bibliography at the back of your required text for the course, Gary Hess's
_Vietnam and the United States_.  
  
For students with a strong interest in the impact of the war on Milwaukee,
special arrangments have been set-up with the University Archives on the
second floor of the Golda Meir Library to make available primary source
materials on anti-war protest at UWM and in Milwaukee and the experiences of
returning veterans.  
  
For some examples of possible issues to explore and some helpful do's and
don'ts for posing a successful research question, click [
here](VtnWarpaper.html). You should also feel free to discuss your plans with
Professor Bradley and/or your teaching assistant.  
  
All students must submit a one-page typewritten prospectus outlining plans for
their papers by Friday, March 21. This should include a paragraph outlining
your research question and a list of the sources you plan to use. Your section
meetings during the week of March 31 will focus on strategies for interpreting
source materials and writing an effective essay. Final papers are due in
lecture on Wednesday, April 30.  
  
  
**Exams.** There will be an in-class midterm examination on Monday, February
24\. The final examination for the course is scheduled for Thursday, May 8,
from 10 a.m. to Noon.  
  

* * *

  * Informed Participation in Weekly Discussion Sections -- 20%

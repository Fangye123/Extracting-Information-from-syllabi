**History 26 - EUROPEAN CIVILIZATION, 1815-1945 - Mr. Steffens**

History 26 will include the period from the reign of Napoleon until 1945.
Emphasis will be placed upon the 19th and early 20th century backgrounds to
our contemporary world. Selected social, cultural, scientific, philosophical,
technological and political developments will be placed in historical context.
Our emphasis will be on understanding and interpreting historical events. The
course is designed to invite students to reach conclusions about modern
European civilization, rather than to provide only a chronological narrative
of events.

the descriptions of these requirements in class, it is your responsibility to
understand what is required for this course. I am willing to answer any
questions that you might have about the course requirements. **Attendance at
every class, taking careful reading and lecture notes, and reading, writing
and learning history, are your responsibilities.** I will help you to learn
and understand history this semester.

  

### **STUDENT WRITING REQUIREMENTS**

**1\. TWO IN-CLASS ESSAYS**

[These essays will be written on Feb.19, and March 31, as noted above.]

There will be 2 essay examinations given in class during the course of the
semester. These examinations will last for 50 minutes. You will receive a
numerical grade for each essay. The essays are worth 25 % each, for a total of
50% of your final course grade. [If it is necessary for you to miss an
examination, for reasons of health or family emergency, you must arrange to
take the examination as soon as possible after you return to classes.]

Topics for these essays will be chosen directly from the required reading
assignments, and from the class lectures, to that date. It is crucial that you
read the required readings carefully, and that you stay current with the
reading assignments. **You will need to take careful reading and lecture notes
throughout the semester.** In your essay, you will be expected to: (1) provide
a full summary of the information available to you on the topic; and (2)
display an understanding of this information by making appropriate connections
between the topic and the historical context of the times. Your essays will be
evaluated on the basis of **BOTH** information content, and evidence that you
have understood the topic by relating it to the broader historical narrative.
**You are expected to display both knowledge and understanding in these
essays.**

You will be provided with study questions before each examination. You should
prepare your draft essay answer to each of the study questions at home, well
in advance of the exam. It is especially important for you to use information
from our required readings, as well as from your class notes, in the
preparation of your essays. One of these questions will be selected, at
random, for you to write during the examination period. You should prepare
your essays carefully, so that you will be able to complete them during the 50
minute examination period. If you can not write for the full 50 minute
examination period, it is clear that you have not found enough information, or
given enough thought to your essay.

[NOTE - For helpful suggestions on preparing your essays at home, and for
writing your essay in class, see **_Writer's Guide: History_**. ]

**2\. FINAL EXAMINATION - May**

There will be two essay questions on topics encompassing the full semester's
work on your final examination. **You will have THREE hours to write your TWO
essays.** These essays should incorporate the historical knowledge and
understanding that you acquired in preparing for your in-class essays. You
will be expected to synthesize information, and to analyze and evaluate
historical questions related to the course, in your final examination essays.
This is your opportunity to show what you have learned during the course of
the semester. You should plan to write for a minimum of one hour for each
essay.  

You will be provided with study questions before your final examination. These
questions will require a broader conceptual understanding of European history
than the relatively direct and specific essays that you have prepared for and
written during the semester. You should review your reading and lecture notes
carefully in preparation for these essays. Your previous preparations and
drafts for each of the essay examination questions during the semester will be
very important to you as you prepare for the final examination. You should
review all of your reading and lecture notes, as well as the drafts that you
prepared for each of the study questions for the two in-class exams. Two of
the study questions for the final examination will be chosen, at random, for
you to write for your final examination. You should prepare your essays
carefully, and plan to write for a minimum of one hour for each essay. If you
cannot write for at least one full hour for each of your final examination
essays, it is clear that your have not found enough information, or given
enough thought to your essays.

The final examination date and time are chosen by the University. You must
write the final examination at this scheduled time and date.

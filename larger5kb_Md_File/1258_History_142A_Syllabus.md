### Introduction

The Frontier is backcountry, ghost town, cowboys & indians, prairie &
homesteaders, ranchers & sodbusters. It is more than these familiar images,
though, as well. The American Frontier is the encounter of the Americas and
the [native] Americans with the rest of the world, a historical development
that began in 1492 and is still going on today. Although this is a
transnational phenomenon, this course is primarily concerned with the Frontier
in North America, and in the state of California in particular.

We will be exploring the relationship between the concept of the Frontier and
the various locations of the West in American history, thinking of the
Frontier as simultaneously place, process, and myth. As we will see, how one
views the Frontier has a lot to do with one's own perspective - people in
different positions in their societies, or at different times, tend to see
entirely different things in the Frontier. In order to better situate our
analysis - and to look at different frontiers comparatively - this course will
focus primarily upon California as a case study in the larger American
Frontier context.

Central to the history of the Frontier, and particularly evident in the
history of California over the last five centuries, is the contact between
diverse cultures and peoples. Evident as well is the violence and suffering
that too often ensued from that contact. Consequently, we will be examining
the different ways the Frontier operated - the different ways it was
experienced and the different discourses that were produced - by women and
men, native Americans and immigrants from Europe, China, and Africa, urbanites
and homesteaders, citizens of the United States, Britain, Spain, Mexico,
Russia, and France.

#### Requirements

This course is principally a writing course. There will be a comprehensive
final examination at the end of the course, but this exam is intended
primarily to test comprehension of the course material. The real work, and
fun, of analysis and synthesis will be a product of the written assignments.
In this course, you will be required to write a total of four 2 page papers,
as well as a final 7-9 page essay. Furthermore, as this is a discussion
course, attendance and participation will also be mandatory.

Attendance & Participation |  |  10%

### Schedule

Following is a schedule of class meetings, topics of discussion/lecture, and
reading assignments. As discussion will be an important part of this course,
it is essential that you complete all the reading _**by the time of the
section for which it is assigned.**_

You will notice that there are two fairly lengthy books assigned for this
course (John Mack Faragher's Daniel Boone & William Cronon's Nature's
Metropolis); you are hereby advised to begin these books early. The syllabus
divides up the reading in these books into logical and convenient portions,
but you would do well to finish each entire book over the weekend before the
subsequent discussions of them.

**Course Objectives**  
  

This course has as its aim an understanding of political change with
particular emphasis on the political state. Under what circumstances did the
state arise and how has it evolved? Is the state necessary for governance? Of
major importance is the relationship between economic and political change,
especially for democratic governance. The most profound changes, if not always
the most immediately visible, occur in the course of revolutions. A major
focus of the course will, therefore, be on the revolutionary process and its
implications for governance and the state. Throughout our survey we will
discuss and evaluate competing strategies of revolutionary change as well as
competing methodologies for analyzing change. The contrast between Marxist and
non-Marxist methodologies and their utility will be an underlying theme. While
the focus in the second half of the course will shift to what are often called
Third World or underdeveloped countries, the overall goal is to understand the
interconnectedness of political change between more developed and less
developed societies.

  
**Course Requirements**  
  
Course participants may fulfill the requirements by selecting one of two
options:

  1. by taking the mid-quarter and final examination and writing a short paper (see the end of the syllabus for details), OR,
  2. by taking the final examination and writing a research paper of about 15-20 pages.

The topic and content of the research paper will be tailored to individual
interests and in consultation with the instructor. The decision to write a
research paper must be made no later than **October 9**. For either option,
the final exam counts toward 50% of the final grade while the short paper and
mid-quarter exam (option 1) each count toward 25%. The research paper (option
2) counts toward 50% of the final grade. Both exams will be based on the
readings, lectures and class discussions. Study questions will be provided in
advanced of both exams. All papers are due the last class session, **Dec. 4**.

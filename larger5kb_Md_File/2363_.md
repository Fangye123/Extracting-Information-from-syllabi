**Description of the Course :**

In this course we will survey the history of the Christian church from the
outbreak of Reformation to the present day, integrating the many varieties of
Christian experience found throughout the world in the modern period. First,
we will look at the splintering of the church in the sixteenth century and the
various struggles this engendered in the larger society. The move from
religious warfare to secularization will then be studied, including the
challenges of science and skepticism. With Christianity continuing to spread
in parts of the world affected by European imperialism, particular attention
will be given to the cultural adaptations of Christian belief and worship.
Renewal movements, mostly of the nineteenth century, helped set the stage for
the different ways the church has changed to meet the pressures of
contemporary society and we will end the course considering where the church
is now and where it might be headed into the future.

A large part of Christianity's strength and influence lies in its dogma and
teachings. For that reason we will read from important documents that shed
light on how the church developed doctrinally. The social, cultural, and
political contexts will be examined through the works of renown historians,
theologians, and social scientists. Primary sources, interpretive essays, and
secondary readings by scholars bring us into close contact with the mental
worlds of earlier Christians and provide the necessary touchstones for proper
historical analysis.

The format of the course consists of lectures and films but a good deal of
time will be devoted to class discussions based on the readings, in a modified
seminar format. It is only through an exchange of ideas that we can cultivate
the critical and analytical skills needed to understand the past as more than
just a series of "events."

**Class Requirements :**

1.  _ **    **_     _**Class Discussion.** _ It is important to keep up with the reading assignments **before** each class meeting so as to make meaningful discussions possible. Informed class participation is **required** and comprises **20% of your semester grade**.  **Be sure to bring the Bettenson book with you to each class as we will be reading and discussing frequently particular documents found therein. If you don't keep up with the readings, take notes on them, and participate in discussions, it is extremely unlikely you will be able to pass this course**.

2.  _ **    **_     _**Examinations.** _ There will be **one mid-term examination on Tuesday, February 26** that will count for **20% of the total grade**. You will be expected to include material from the lectures, readings and films into your answer. The **final exam** will be two essay questions (at least one of which will be cumulative), with possibly some identification terms, and constitute **40% of the overall grade**. In all essays you are expected to set up a thesis, organize a clear answer and provide the details necessary to support it. **Please note that the final exam is scheduled for Tuesday, April 30, from 10:30 am - 1:00 pm. Make travel plans with this in mind.**

3.  _ **    **_     _**Writing Assignments.** _ To help you analyze the historical content of both primary and secondary sources you are required to submit critical review essays of two of the non-text course books (Brown, Bunyan, Achebe, Wills). **Both reviews should be 4-5 pp., typed, and double-spaced. They are due on Tuesday, April 16, at the beginning of class, and each will be worth 10% of the final grade. Any late papers will result in the grade being lowered accordingly. Printer mishaps are not an acceptable excuse!**

**Office Hours :   **          TuTh 10:00-11:00 am, and by appointment

**Grading Scale :    **       A = 93-100 A- = 90-92 B+ = 87-89 B = 83-86 B- =

An administrative F (0) is earned for late papers, missed examinations, or
missed presentations that are unexcused. If there is a **real** emergency you
**must** reach me  **before** the scheduled date. **To be fair, there are no
exceptions!**

regulations of FAU as described in the undergraduate catalog (see sections

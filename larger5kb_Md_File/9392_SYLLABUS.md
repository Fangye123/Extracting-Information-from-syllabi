            "Since the primary characteristic of the Muslim World (The Middle East) is that it is Muslim, we introduce our study with an attempt to elucidate what this means, emphasizing that it means a very great deal, including much that is relevant to the currents of modern history.  Secondly, illustrating our observation that the present of Islamic society is in significant measure the outgrowth of the immediate past, we turn next to a general survey of the recent background throughout the Muslim World, discerning amidst the numerous diversities something of a common pattern--enough at least to justify the concept that Islamic History continues apace."  Wilfrid Cantwell Smith, _Islam in Modern History_.  

**Course Objectives** :

            The relevance of the Middle East to the world situation is frightening!  The people and problems of that area are in desperate need of greater understanding on our part.  Beyond that, however, we set as our objective to understand the above quotation of Wilfrid Cantwell Smith with all its implications: i.e. to understand what Middle Eastern Civilization is today and what that means in terms of historical, political, economic and social developments. 

**Required Texts** :

Albert Hourani, _A History of the Arab Peoples_. _  
The Middle East_ , (Ninth Edition), Congressional Quarterly.

**Examinations** :

            There will be two essay examinations, a mid-term and a final, based on material presented in class and in the textbook.  Each exam will be worth 30% of the final grade. 

**Attendance** :

            Attendance is expected in each class period.  Students are responsible for all material and information presented in class and should be prepared to discuss assigned readings in each class period.  Class participation will be worth 10% of the final grade. 

**Paper: Each** student will write one well-developed interpretive essay (5-7
pages).   This essay should reflect your own thinking about a specific topic,
based on lectures and two or three solid outside sources.  The paper should
include a strong thesis statement, logical development, and a conclusion that
does more than summarize the thesis but states the
significance/relevance/implications of the thesis to the writer and to the
reader.  The paper should be written in proper style (Harbrace Handbook or
Turabian) and must include endnotes/footnotes or parenthetical references and
a bibliography.  All papers must be typed.  Papers are due on July 31.  They
will be returned on August 4.  To receive a grade for your paper, you must
respond to the comments and re-submit your paper on August 6.  Deadlines are
absolute.  **Late papers will not be accepted** except under extraordinary
circumstances and will be penalized one letter grade.

**REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES**  

If you have a disability that may require assistance or accommodation, or you
have questions related to any accommodations for testing, note takers,
readers, etc., please speak with me as soon as possible.  Students may also
contact the Office of Disabled Students Services (898-2783) with questions
about such services.

**STATEMENT ON CHEATING**  

Any form of cheating (including plagiarism) will result in a grade of "F" for
the course.  Plagiarism is defined in The American College Dictionary as
follows:  "1\. copying or initiating the language, ideas, and thoughts of
another author and passing off the same as one's original work.  2\. something
appropriated and put forth in this manner."

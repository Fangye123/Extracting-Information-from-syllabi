#### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

Many of our assumptions about the nature of modern life took shape in Europe
during the "long" nineteenth century (1789-1914). This was also the period in
which the relationship between history and the social sciences was defined.
This course uses a combination of intellectual and social history and the
close analysis of texts to acquaint students with theories and concepts that
help make sense of human social existence in the contemporary era. Students
will read, in the original, the landmark works of thinkers who defined the
terms of debate over the past, present, and future course of human history. In
the process, students will be asked to confront the timeless issues raised by
life in a social context: how to make sense of the elusive patterns which
govern day-to-day social interaction and long-term social development; how to
balance the conflicting needs for social order and social change; and how to
reconcile the mutual rights and obligations of individuals on the one hand and
the social group on the other. Each segment of the course invites students to
ask how the theorist conceived of the historical process and to what extent
each advanced a coherent model of society. The objective of the course is to
provide students with an overview of competing theories of history and to
equip them for the task of interpreting the patterns they observe in the
social world around them.

Most core readings in this course have been drawn from the works of four
figures --- Tocqueville, Marx, Durkheim, and Weber --- all of whom made
significant contributions to the study of history, even as they laid the
groundwork for the disciplines of political science, economics, sociology, and
anthropology. Our consideration of this material will be preceded by an
introductory segment on precursors of the socialized perspective on history in
the early modern period; and will be followed by a concluding segment that
points in the direction of twentieth-century developments.

#### INSTRUCTOR'S OFFICE HOURS

Office hours will be held on Monday from noon to 1 p.m. and Wednesday from 11
a.m. to noon in 277 Stevenson Faculty Office Building. You may reserve a
specific time slot by placing your name and phone number on the sign-up list
posted on my office door. My office phone number is 459-2465.

Students with disabilities who feel that they may need accommodations should
first register with the Disabilties Resource Center and then come to my office
hours within the first two weeks of the quarter. Bring a copy of the DRC's
Accommodation Request Form with you.

#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS

In addition to attending lectures and staying current with the readings,
students must complete four in-class, short-answer quizzes and two take-home
essay examinations.

The precise date for each quiz will depend on how quickly we move through the
material. In general, each will occur shortly after we conclude our
consideration of one the main theorists' writings. Your evaluation will
reflect your performance on your three best quizzes. You must take at least
three quizzes in order to pass the course.

The first take-home will be handed out at the end of class on Friday, October
28 and will be due at the start of class on Monday, November 2. Questions will
cover the material on Tocqueville and Marx. Your essay will be strictly
limited to no more than 1000 words (typewritten, triple-spaced, with generous
margins; you must indicate the precise word count on your cover page.)

The second take-home will be handed out at the end of class on Friday,
December 2 and will be due at my office (277 Stevenson), not later than noon
on December 6. One question will cover the material on Durkheim and Weber. A
second question will ask you to address the overarching themes of the course.
Each essay will be strictly limited to no more than 1000 words (typewritten,
triple-spaced, with generous margins; you must indicate the precise word count
of each essay on your cover page.)

Please note: All work for this course must be completed in a timely fashion.
The grade of incomplete is not available for failure to complete the course
requirements on time. Students will be expected to hand in the corrected
version of their first take-home essay along with their second take-home so
that I have all of their written work available when I prepare narrative
evaluations.



#### READING LIST:

The following books will be available in paperback editions at the Bay Tree
Bookstore. They have also been placed on reserve at McHenry Library.

  * Bellah, Robert N., ed. Emile Durkheim on Morality and Society, U. Chicago Press. 
  * Tucker, Robert, ed. The Marx-Engels Reader, Norton. 
  * Weber, Max. The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism. (Either the Roxbury or the Scribners/Counterpoint edition is fine.) 

In addition, a course reader is available at the campus Copy Center. Because
the Tocqueville readings which correspond to the initial segment of the course
are contained in that reader, it is essential that students obtain a copy as
quickly as possible. All course readings are also available on two-hour
reserve at McHenry Library.

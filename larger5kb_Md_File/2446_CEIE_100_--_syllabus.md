###  Homework Assignments and Quizzes

| [Homework assignments](homework.htm) requiring the submission of answers are
generally available on the web by Wednesday morning, and are generally due the
following Tuesday in class.  There will not be a homework solution due every
week.  Be sure to review the complete set of [rules governing
homework](homework.htm) assignments.

Reading assignments will given every week.  Tentative scheduling of these
assignments is provided in the syllabus below.  As the semester continues,
these will be updated.

Quizzes will be given aperiodically through the semester.  These will be short
tests (5 - 15 minutes) held in class.  These will generally be unannounced and
make-up quizzes will not be offered.  
  
### Exams

|

There will be two midterm exams plus a final exam.  The dates for the exams
are provided in the schedule below.  
  
### Grades

|

Grades will be determined as a combination of exams (midterms, final),
quizzes, homework, and class participation.  The relative contributions of
these scores toward a semester course grade are:

| Homework and Quizzes | 25 %  
---|---  
Midterm 1 | 20 %  
Midterm 2 | 20 %  
Final | 25 %  
Class Participation | 10 %  
  
The lowest homework or quiz grade for the semester will be dropped from the
computation of average homework-quiz grade for the semester.  For example, if
there are eight homework assignments and six quizzes for the semester, the
average homework-quiz grade for the semester will be found by averaging the
best 13 grades.

Information about Mid-Semester grades filed with the Registrar may be found in
the [Announcements](announce.htm).  
  
### Honor Code

Code](http://www.gmu.edu/facstaff/handbook/aD.html) is in effect for this

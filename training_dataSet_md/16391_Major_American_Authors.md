**Policies**  
**ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION**  
Come to class every day on time and prepared. Not only will absences hurt your
participation grade, but more than four absences **for any reason** will
automatically lower your final grade. I will occasionally quiz the class as
well, to make sure you are keeping up with the reading.  
See the  "Reading Logs and Participation" section below for more information
on the Participation component of your grade.  
**LATE PAPERS AND MAKEUP EXAMS**  
Papers are due under (or in a crate outside) my office door on the date
assigned. Papers not in my hands first thing the next morning will lose one
letter grade. I will not accept papers that come in later than midnight the
next weekday.  
You are welcome to rewrite your textual analysis papers, and I will average
the grades from the two installments. See the  "Analysis Paper" section below
for details.  
There will be no makeups on exams unless you have arranged them with me
beforehand (voice mail doesn't count here).

**Analysis Paper/ Period Report**  
We will use this assignment to expand the literary-historical context for the
texts on the syllabus. Five days during the semester are set aside for student
reports, corresponding to the following five periods of American literary
history: 1) pre 1700; 2) 1700-1800; 3) 1800-1865; 4) 1865-1910; and 5)
1910-1945 (I will discuss 1945 to the present myself on December 9). On each
of these days, six students (give or take) will provide oral reports for the
class **on some short text from that period which is included in the _Heath
Anthology of American Literature_ but is not included on the syllabus. ** Each
student will also complete a formal analysis paper on the text reported on.  
  
**THE TEXT (OBJECT OF ANALYSIS)**  
  
Your first order of business is to pick a text to work with. You are to select
something included in the Heath Anthology; you should have the Table of
Contents among your handouts for the class, and the volumes themselves are on
reserve in the Library. You may work with a poem, short story, speech, essay,
or fragment of a longer work. I encourage (but do not require) you to choose
something beyond the borders of what is traditionally thought of as
"canonical" American literature. A good rule of thumb might be to work with an
author who is not included in the Table of Contents (which you have) for the
1979 Norton Anthology of American Literature. I strongly encourage you to
choose a text of a manageable length.  
**REPORT (10% OF FINAL GRADE)**  
  
In order to fit six reports into an hour period, we must be efficient. Each
report will last no longer than eight minutes (I will use an egg timer to cut
you off).  
Your primary task in the report will be to describe your text--to familiarize
us with an author, a style, a plot, themes, etc., that we have not encountered
within the confines of our syllabus. This might include some background on the
writer or on a type of writing (a genre, a common theme, a minority
perspective) that he or she represents. It will probably involve a brief plot
summary and description of what makes the text interesting. And it will most
likely mean that you tell us what your analytical thesis in approaching the
text will be. I will be most impressed by reports that explain how the text
fits into its period, ways it is reminiscent of or different from the texts of
that period that are on the syllabus.  
I will evaluate your report holistically, combining content and style. You may
present your material as formally or informally as you like. I discourage you
from reading it to us (though there are engaging reading styles that might
work very well), but the report should show evidence of practice, in terms of
its structure, its delivery, and its length. What I am most concerned with is
that you communicate effectively--that you teach us something. This will
depend on what you choose to tell us in the time available, as well as how
comfortable and articulate you are in the telling (eye contact, bodily
comfort, and vocal delivery). Consider whether you can incorporate handouts,
overhead projections, or audio or video clips into your report smoothly, so
that they help us follow you without distracting us or detracting too much
from your limited time.  
  
**ANALYSIS PAPER (20% OF FINAL GRADE)**  
Your primary task with the text you choose will be to complete a written
analysis paper on it. The paper should be at least five typed pages long,
double-spaced with reasonable font and margins, and it will be due at my
office door by on the date indicated on the syllabu (Note: for the first three
groups this is the class day after they give their reports. For the final two
groups, it is Wednesday, October 23).  
The paper should follow MLA format (described in the Bedford Handbook) for
titling, page numbering, or documenting any outside sources (though you are
not required to use sources for this), and it should observe the conventions
for writing about literature (BH, Ch. 53).  
There are great chunks of the Heath Anthology, that I have not read; assume
that I have not read the piece you are analyzing. Thus, while you still must
be careful not to rely heavily on plot summary (that is, don't substitute plot
summary for argument), you will need to describe the work thoroughly enough
that I can follow and evaluate your argument.  
**How to Analyze:** To  "analyze" something is to discover and explain how it
works. Thus, to analyze a literary work is to make an argument about **how**
it achieves its overall effect, or makes its central point (even if this
effect is chaotic, or its point has to do with ambiguity). The most effective
analyses will focus on one **part** of the work: either one of the literary
elements (character, setting, imagery, theme, style, tone, structure, point-
of-view, etc.); or some fragment of the text (one passage, one scene, one
image or motif, one turn-of-phrase). You will need then to relate this part to
the whole of the work: how does this element or fragment contribute to or
reinforce the work's meaning? Of course, to do this, you need to have some
plausible sense of the work's meaning, though this may well be subjective--
even unique to you.  
Another approach to analysis is to claim that the text achieves an unintended
effect that we can determine if we read from, for instance, a feminist,
serving-class, or psychoanalytic perspective, or from the vantage of some
historically concurrent socio-political debate. You might also do a
deconstructionist reading, which identifies the ways the text works against
its author's apparent intention; or a reader-response analysis, which examines
ways the text invites the reader in to complete its meaning.  
**To repeat: an analysis focuses more on how a text means than on what it
means.** Instead of an analysis, you might decide to do an explication, in
which you systematically explain incidents or images in a work. This approach
is appropriate to poems and short, obscure stories. The danger here is that
you can slip into plot summary. Remember, in an explication you interpret--
explain the significance of--events, as opposed merely to relating them.  
**I strongly recommend that you read the Bedford Handbook's chapter on
"Writing About Literature" (Chapter 53). **  
**Rewrite Option:** If you wish to rewrite the paper, you will have two weeks
from the date I return it. You should turn in your original--including my
comments--with your rewrite, and I will average your grades from the two
versions of the paper to get your final grade. All rewrites should be
substantially rewritten as described in Chapters 3 and 4 of the Bedford
Handbook; I will not give higher grades for mere revisions. You will also need
to turn in a one-page typed explanation of your rewrite strategy along with
the rewritten paper (an example of these is attached to this syllabus).  
  
**Reading Logs and Participation**  
Class participation will count for 10% of your final grade. This grade will be
my subjective assessment of how well you handle three components:  
1) Reading Logs: for the four days during the semester set aside for reports,
those students not giving a report will read at least fifteen pages from one
of the books on the reserve list (at the library) for this class. During class
on report day you will turn in a one-page (typed, double-spaced) summary and
critique of what you read. Begin these with the MLA citation for the book your
reading comes from, indicating the page numbers you are covering. Then
summarize your reading and comment on why it is or is not helpful.  
2) Class Discussion: I encourage you to speak up in class discussion. I am
more interested in the quality than in the quantity of your discussion
(dominating discussion, or commentary that relies too heavily on unfounded
opinion, can detract from the quality). I will be most favorably impressed by
those students who are able to bring their outside reading (for the reading
logs or the analysis paper/ reports) to bear on the subject at hand.  
3) Quizzes. I expect you to read every page of every assignment, carefully. I
will occasionally give pop quizzes that either check your reading or provide a
basis for class discussion.

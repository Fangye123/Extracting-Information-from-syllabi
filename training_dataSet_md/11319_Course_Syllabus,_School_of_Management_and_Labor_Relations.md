38:533:542:01  | **HR Decision-Making: Data-Based Decisions**  
Professor Stan Gully This is an applied course intended to introduce students
to the statistical tools used for decision-making in the business context and
in the research process. The goal is to help students become intelligent
consumers of information provided by research and statistics. Throughout the
course there is an emphasis on both conceptual understanding and the
development of practical "how-to" skills. This class is designed to provide an
introduction into the process of conducting research and conducting
statistical analyses of data relevant to HRM. Statistics and the inferences
drawn from them requires reasoning and logic. It is important to understand
both how and why an analysis is performed. Thus, this course is designed to
focus on the conceptual side of statistics. It is also important to understand
some of the assumptions, limitations, or strengths that come along with a
particular procedure. View the syllabus  View the book list

professional organizations, the transformations that have been taking place in
these systems in the U.S., and the impact of these systems on the design of
work. Includes the involvement of employees in quality circles and team
decision-making at the job level, labor-management cooperation and works
councils at the administrative level, and codetermination and employee
ownership at the strategic level of organizations. Includes concepts of job
and work systems design in the context of underlying theories of
organizational design and individual behavior. Highlights the emergence of
teams, team management, and team effects. Considers the implications of work
systems and worker governance for other HR functions and the effect of the
resulting HR systems on firm performance. Looks at worker participation in
both union and non-union work environments. Provides and overview of the
development of unions and the roles they play in organizations and society as
a whole. Considers the ethical questions raised by work design. View the

38:533:590 | **Human Resource Strategy II:Business Functional Areas**  
Professor James Sesil.     In order for a human resource manager to
effectively function as a business partner you will need to have knowledge of
the various business functional areas. This knowledge becomes crucial when
identifying how the HR function can optimally add value at the plant, division
and/or firm level. Additionally, HR managers will find themselves working in
settings with unique characteristics. The environment will impact the way in
which the HR function is developed and deployed. For instance, the HR issues
and corresponding strategy within a unionized manufacturing setting may be
different from a R & D facility View the syllabus View the book list

38:578:541 | **Women and Work**  
Professor Ethel Brooks This course will explore the ways in which work and
labor markets are gendered in their histories, spaces and modes of discipline.
Specifically, we will examine the various duties and representations of women
in the world of work. What is women's work? What are the assumptions that we
have about women's work? What are the specific issues, barriers and problems
faced by women in the labor market? What are the relations, intersections and
modalities of race, class, sex, sexuality and gender that are manifested in
labor histories, labor practices and the workplace? What role do gender
relations play in workplace organization, politics, hierarchies and
discipline? We will examine these questions by taking up various themes that
are prevalent in the world of women and work and by exploring case studies and
perspectives from the United States and other parts of the world. Currently,
in the period of globalized economies and transnational labor flows, it is
particularly important to think through gendered divisions of labor within the
larger, international contexts, and to explore paradigms such as the new
international division of labor, gendered pay gaps and glass ceilings through
the prism of global, transnational and international economic practices, and
through the everyday lives of women working within various global and local
sites.View the syllabus  
38:578:562 | **International/Comparative Labor**  
Professor Carola M Frege. On the eve of the 21st century, we are witnessing an
amazing expansion of capitalism around the world. Freer trade and currency
flows are causing nations to become more tightly integrated with each other.
As a result, nation-states have less control over their economies than ever
before. What impact do the changing economic conditions have on national
industrial relations? Do we see the emergence of a global/ international
industrial relations system and the withering away of national systems? Do
governments loose control over industrial relations? Who will govern
industrial relations in the 21st century? This course aims to provide an
introduction to the comparative analysis of the institutions and processes of
industrial relations at the international, national, enterprise, and workplace
levels. We introduce the principal models of industrial relations systems in
various countries and the main problems facing them in the new century, and
then in the second half of the term we turn to look at the industrial
relations actors in comparative perspective: trade unions, state and
employers. View the Syllabus

Undergraduate: Bachelor in Labor and Employment Relations  
37:575:363 | **Labor Unions and the World Economy**  
Instructor: Debra Davis, Labor unions worldwide are dealing with economic
integration, the impact of technological innovations, new forms of work
organization, employee diversity and the always-present employer resistance to
unionization. The student of the labor movement should recognize the potential
for very broad inquiry in this area given the enormous amount of academic,
business, and union literature on the subject. View the syllabus  
37:575:395 | **Perspectives on Labor Studies**  
Professor Carola M Frege. This course will trace the intellectual and
historical evolution of theory and research on Industrial Relations/Labor
Studies. Industrial Relations is a relatively new social science discipline
dealing with the phenomenon of 'work', with roots going back to the Webbs in
Britain and to the intellectual origins of the New Deal in America. This
course treats industrial relations from a disciplinary perspectives and
explores how different social sciences such as sociology, economics, law or
political science have influenced our thinking and how industrial relations as
a discipline has contributed to the broader social science understanding of
work, employment and society. View the syllabus

motivation, leadership, stress management and group dynamics will be covered.
Course content will be taught through lecture, group exercises and projects,

**This course introduces you to the impact of global conditions on the
management of human resources at home and abroad. It discusses the expansion
of international trade and the growth of US multinational operations abroad.
It teaches you to "read" the human resource systems of other nations and to
understand the forces creating variations in HR systems across nations (for
example, national culture, stage of development, external labor markets, roles
of government, employers, and unions). It focuses on assessing the effect of
these systems on (a) decisions to locate operations in other nations and
coordinate them and (b) how to develop and implement HR strategies and
practices in multinational firms operating in these environments. It teaches
you to recognize the basic patterns in human resource management systems
across developed and developing nations. It considers, globalization,
multinational and expatriate human resource management issues in the context
of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and the multinational corporation.

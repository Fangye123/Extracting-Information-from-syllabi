# Lecture Notes and Interactive Tutorials

This contains lecture notes (and other stuff) for various courses. The notes
for CS 151 are a self-contained course in beginning programming with Java.

Spring 2001 Material:

  * CS 151, Computer Science I (majors) using Java. 
  * CS 355, Systems Programming 
  * CS 570, Information Retrieval 

Material from past Semesters:

  * CS 113, Introduction to Computers (non-majors) using QUICKBASIC . 
  * CS 161, C Programming
  * CS 254, VAX Assembly language
  * CS 420, Object Oriented Programming Systems
  * CS 473, Simulation Techniques 

These notes have been tested using Java-enabled Netscape 4.0. However, Java is
needed for only a few items. Don't rush in and do an assignment until it has
been assigned in class. Some assignments have been sitting here for a few
years and may not be given in your class.

#### CS 113 --- Introduction to Computers (non-majors) using QuickBasic

CS 113 is a general education course in computers and programming using the
Microsoft QuickBasic programming language. The course material consists of 25
chapters of interactive lessons and several miscellaneous hand-outs, the
equivalent of perhaps one half of a full semester course. It is helpful, but
not absolutely necessary to have QuickBasic running on your computer to read
these notes.

#### CS 151 -- Computer Science I, using Java

CS 151 is an introduction to computer science and programming using the
lanugage Java.

#### CS 161 -- C Programming

CS 161 is an introduction to C programming for students who already have
programming experience.

#### CS 254 --- Computer Organization and Assembly Language, using VAX
assembly

These notes discuss assembly language using the VAX MACRO assembly language.
This assembly language is no longer used in CS 254. However, the sections on
digital aritmetic may still be useful. It is necessary to have access to a VAX
with MACRO assembly installed to make full use of these notes, however the
first several chapters cover basic concepts of assembly language and binary
representation and will be useful in any assembly language course. The notes
cover about two thirds of the course, and are a bit sketchy in places.

Challenges for Clinicians
in the New Millennium

Rapid advances in pharmacology and medical devices have led
to an explosion of new techniques available to members of the anesthesia care team,
while economic pressures also threaten to reshape the clinical landscape. Increasingly,
we will need to know not only whether techniques are effective, but also which techniques
are most cost-effective.
The objectives of this conference are to help participants
better understand:


The effect of revolutionary changes in health care on anesthesia
	practice
How to use the new techniques, drugs and monitors
How to incorporate these new tools into practice in the
	changing environment

We will focus on the concerns of clinicians who work with a
wide variety of patients and practice settings. We predict that you will find our
meeting to be exciting, provocative, and educational.
For those desiring additional CME hours, we have scheduled
two optional sessions on Friday and Saturday afternoons. On Friday, University of
Chicago faculty will lead an optional session with discussions of difficult problems
faced by practitioners.  On Saturday, Dr. Andranik Ovassapian will lead his always
interesting, interactive Airway Management Workshop.
We will continue our popular format from previous years: intensive
morning sessions with afternoons and evenings free for enjoyment of all the shopping,
dining and cultural activities for which Chicago is famous. We will also continue
our popular feature for theater-lovers with a first come, first-served option to
purchase tickets for the Disney musical Beauty and the Beast as well
as the holiday favorite: A Christmas Carol. In addition, we have secured
a limited number of tickets for the blockbuster Art Institute exhibition: Van
Gogh and Gauguin: The Studio of the South. The Art Institute will host the only
U.S. showing of this remarkable exhibition.

Location and Accommodations
Come and enjoy the Holiday season in Chicago! The conference
sessions will be held at The Drake, one of Chicago's finest hotels,
located on Michigan Avenue, the "Magnificent Mile." A block of rooms has
been reserved at The Drake and at The Westin Hotel, a short block away.
Rates at the Drake are $184 single or double. Room reservation cards will be sent
with your course confirmation, or you may call the hotel directly at 1-800-55-DRAKE,

Anesthesia and Critical Care Conference. Rates at the Westin are $189 single, $219
double. You may call the hotel directly for reservations at 1-800-228-3000, (in Illinois,

the University of Chicago room block. At both hotels, room reservations must
be made by October 29 to guarantee the reduced rate. However, both hotels
will sell out over these dates due to the annual meeting of the Radiological Society,
so we strongly recommend you make your reservations early.

Chicago is truly a city with something for everyone!
For the best in Holiday shopping there are the world
famous stores and boutiques of Chicago's Gold Coast. Marshall Field's, Lord
& Taylor, Bloomingdale's, Saks Fifth Avenue, Nordstrom's, Neiman Marcus, FAO
Schwarz, Crate & Barrel, and Nike Town are all part of the excitement
of Michigan Avenue during the Holiday season. Water Tower Place with its many fine
shops, restaurants and movie theaters, is just a few steps away.
Chicago's museums are worthy of a day's visit in themselves,
particularly The Field Museum of Natural History, home of SUE,
the largest, most complete T-Rex ever discovered. No special tickets are
necessary to view Sue, just the price of admission ($8 adults, $4 children.) You
can also choose to visit the world-famous Art Institute of Chicago, the Museum
of Contemporary Art, the Shedd Aquarium, the Adler Planetarium, or the Museum
of Science and Industry. Musical offerings vary from The Chicago
Symphony Orchestra and The Lyric Opera to the many blues and
jazz nightspots located throughout the city. You may enjoy sampling the variety of
the Steppenwolf, Goodman, and Victory Gardens theater
companies. (Victory Gardens was the winner of the 2001 Tony for best regional
theater company.) You may want to experience the fun at Chicago's famous comedy
club, Second City. You will certainly want to sample the fare at the
wide variety of restaurants featuring cuisine from all over the world. See http://chicago.citysearch.com

Optional Tickets
In continuing a very popular tradition, we have secured
a limited number of seats to Beauty and the Beast, Disney's smash hit
musical, at the beautiful Cadillac Palace Theater in Chicago's new theater district.
Nominated for nine 1994 Tony Awards including Best Musical, this eye-popping spectacle
has been wowing audiences worldwide, with record-breaking runs in New York, London,
Los Angeles, Toronto, Sydney, Tokyo, Stuttgart and Madrid. Based on the Academy Award-winning
animated feature film, Disney's musical extravaganza is filled with technical wizardry,
special effects and illusions, as well as dazzling production numbers. These tickets
for Saturday evening, December 1 are $72 each, and are available on a first
come, first served basis to registrants and their families only.
We have also secured seats for the annual Chicago
tradition: A Christmas Carol, at the Goodman Theater. These tickets
are for the Saturday evening performance, December 1 and are the perfect way
to get into the holiday spirit! Tickets for A Christmas Carol are $50 each and are
available on a first come, first served basis to registrants and their families only.
In addition to the theater options, we have secured
tickets for the major Art Institute Exhibition, Van Gogh and Gauguin, The Studio
of the South. Co-organized by The Art Institute of Chicago and the Van Gogh Museum,
this exhibition examines the complex relationship between Vincent Van Gogh and Paul
Gauguin and the plan they developed together to create a "Studio of the South."
The Art Institute will host the only U.S. showing of this remarkable exhibition,
which features 125 paintings, works on paper, and sculptures. Assembled from collections
world-wide, the exhibition combines some of the world's most famous images with rarely
seen treasures. These tickets are $20 each and are for either Friday or Saturday
afternoon to registrants and their families only. These tickets will go fast,
so make sure you register early!
If you wish to purchase tickets for any of these events,
please indicate on your registration form and enclose your check by October 15. These
tickets are non-refundable.

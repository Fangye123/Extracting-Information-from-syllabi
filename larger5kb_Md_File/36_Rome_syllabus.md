Rome rose from a small city in central Italy to control one of the largest
empires the world has ever known. In the course of this remarkable rise, the
Romans needed to learn how to govern an enormous territory which contained a
diverse assortment of peoples. The legal and administrative structures of the
Roman state, its religious and artistic traditions, its physical
infrastructure, cities, and monuments, spread throughout Europe, the
Mediterranean and the Near East, profoundly affecting the cultural development
of these regions. In this course, we will trace the history of Rome's rise to
greatness from the early days of the Republic, through the establishment of
the Principate, to the transformations of the later Empire. We will see how it
encountered, absorbed, and was influenced by the surrounding peoples. We will
also examine how the characteristic institutions of Roman life emerged, and
how they shaped the lives both of the elites and of the common people. We will
rely on text books, and several primary sources, translations of significant
works of Latin literature, as well as inscriptions and the archaeological
remains and artistic monuments of Rome which will help us to understand how
the Romans saw themselves and their world.  


###  Requirements:

Attendance and participation in class is expected for this class. You should
read the material and come to class prepared to discuss it.  In addition, the
course will make use of Blackboard
([blackboard.unf.edu](http://blackboard.unf.edu)) for its supplementary
materials and for on-line discussion. Familiarize yourself with Blackboard;
you will be expected to post weekly contributions to on-line discussions about
the readings. You will also be expected to do one presentation on a Roman art
object or monument, in order to enrich the class's exposure to the archaeology
and artistic heritage of Rome. The rest of your grade will come from a mid-
term, a final exam, and a 5-page paper in which you will analyze a Roman work
of literature in terms of what it tells us about Roman life.

**About the Course:   The United States From Emancipation Through World War
II** is a survey course in American history. Among the goals for the course
are the following: 1) to provide students with a broad understanding of the
people, events, ideas and forces that shaped U.S. history from 1865 to 1945;
2) to help students develop those skills that will allow them to continue to
learn from the past -- accomplishing this goal includes increasing students'
familiarity with the AU Library and with information available on the World
Wide Web; 3) to help students learn to communicate their knowledge, both
orally and in writing; and 4) to help students develop an informed
understanding of historical practice -- the interplay of history and memory,
the role of evidence, how history is created or "constructed" by historians,
museum curators, movie makers and many others. For more details, including
grading policies, click on **[Assessment](usassess.htm)**.

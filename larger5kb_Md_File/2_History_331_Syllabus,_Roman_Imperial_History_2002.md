**Course Description** : Rome's "imperial" period traditionally begins with
the "princeps" Augustus consolidating an empire stretching from Spain to
Persia, Ethiopia to Russia, under a centralized bureaucracy. The period ends
with Rome's Islamic successor driving two tiny survivors, Byzantium and
Charlemagne's Holy Roman Empire, back under cover. This course will outline
the evolving imperial strategies and their social effects. It will also
attempt to explain the vast shift from Augustus' laissez-faire conglomeration
of peoples and kingdoms to Diocletian's totalitarian state, from the great pax
romana (Roman peace) to the endless battles with wave after wave of
"barbarians," from syncretic polytheism to the theocracy of Theodosius and his
Muslim followers, in short, from antiquity to the "middle age."

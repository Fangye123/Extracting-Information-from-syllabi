**OVERVIEW OF COURSE: This course will introduce concepts of all social
sciences: anthropology, sociology, psychology, economics, political science,
and history. We will also consider how these disciplines are integrated.
Individual research is also a requirement of this course.**

**CLASS REQUIREMENTS:**

  1. **Maintain reading requirements in textbook:** ** _Power and Society: An Introduction to the Social Sciences_** **, 8th edition, by Thomas R. Dye. (See Reading Syllabus)**
  2. **Promptness to class and regular class attendance are imperative! Roll will be taken at the beginning of class only. If you are not present at that time, you will be counted absent. If you are late, you must see me after class to correct the roll. You will receive a grade for attendance. From a beginning grade of 100, 3 points will be deducted for every unexcused, undocumented absence; 2 points for excessive tardiness (more than 5 minutes); 1 point for other tardiness.**
  3. **Maintain thorough notes from class lectures. I would suggest finding someone to swap phone numbers and e-mail addresses with so that you can get notes when you are absent.**
  4. **Conduct yourself in a respectful manner during class lectures, discussions, and presentations. Be aware that we will have varying opinions on issues discussed this semester. Please regard others' views in an adult manner.**
  5. **From time to time, class discussions may have to be cut short or the subject matter may be extremely controversial. On those occasions you will be assigned response papers to write. These papers will not be graded on your opinion, but how well you defend your position on the topic. These will count as part of your class participation grade. These may be handwritten (if your handwriting is legible) or typed. Grammar will be checked and excessive mistakes will affect your grade. Be sure to proofread your responses before turning them in.**
  6. **Individual Internet research and presentations will be central to our discussions on anthropology, sociology, and political science. A list of these topics and instructions on how to do these assignments are given at the end of this syllabus.**
  7. **A journal of articles about the presidential campaign should be kept throughout the semester that includes articles about the candidates from the two main political parties, but can include articles about other candidates from other parties as well. A minimum of 6 articles are required with an even number of articles about each of the two major candidates. On Monday, November 6, you will turn in your journal with your articles and a brief paper (typed) summarizing the content of the articles and your predictions and conclusions about the election. A works cited page should be included following the format of APA or MLA. Be sure to cite your sources within the paper using the same format!**
  8. **Turn in all assignments on the assigned due dates. LATE ASSIGNMENTS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. If you must be absent on the day an assignment is due, you must e-mail it to me or have someone deliver it to my mailbox before 11:30 a.m. on the day it is due. Make-up tests are not given for absences unless you have a documented excuse for not being here and you e-mail me ahead of time with your reason for not being here! This is strictly enforced!**
  9. **Tape recorders are not allowed!**
  10. **Pagers and cell phones are distracting and should be turned off during class. If you have a necessity for having one on, please inform the instructor.**
  11. **Students must abide by policies in the College Catalog, Student Handbook, and if applicable, program handbook.**
  12. **Syllabus is subject to be changed or altered. Students will be notified in a timely manner concerning any changes.**

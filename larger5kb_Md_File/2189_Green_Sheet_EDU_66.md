group, and remaining for the entire session. **All assignments must be
completed in order to pass the class.**  
Changes in internship scheduling must be approved by the school-site
supervisor you are assigned to and by your instructor.  
  
A number of videos will be shown during this course to illustrate research in
progress and new concepts discussed in class. Treat viseos as you would
lectures by taking notes. Videos serve as a good basis for many exam
questions.  
  
Quizzes will be given throughout the quarter. If a student is ill or cannot
take the quiz on the given date, it is the student's responsibility to inform
the instructor prior to the exam. The test must be taken before the next class
meeting and with the permission of the instructor.  
  
**Evaluation:  
** Grades based on percentage of points earned. I teach many students per
year, each of whom have multiple grades, it is inevitable that an occasional
grade will be misplaced or misreported. therefore, it is imperative that you
keep all the work returned to you in your folder and a continual record of
your scores.  
  
**Grading:  
** The percentage system for determining grades on all papers.  
A=90-100%       270-300 points

Good practices: Avoid plagiarism and chesting. "Plagiarism is defined by the
college as presenting the work of others without crediting them." This is
considered a breach of academic integrity and is to result in a range of
sanctions stated in the catolog.  
  
**Students who do not understand English, or who need help in understanding
the lectures or demonstrations will be responsible for securing assistance in
interpreting the instruction. The Tutorial Center may be reached
at<http://www.deanza.fhda.edu/services/tutorial/>  
  
  
Out of respect for the others students please turn off cell phones and pagers
before entering the classroom.

 HIS 512:306  
 United States 1945-Present  
 Professor Steven F. Lawson

OBJECTIVES:

This course traces the development of the United States since 1945.  It
examines the effects of wars, affluence, and the growth of the consumer
culture on American institutions and values.  The class pays special attention
to the impact of race, class, and gender in shaping the United States during
the second half of the twentieth century.  Topics include the increased
centralization of power in the federal government and the role of the United
States as an imperial nation.  Discussions will deal with the rise of the Cold
War and its impact on domestic and foreign affairs, America's entry into Korea
and Vietnam, the expansion of liberal reform from Truman's Fair Deal through
Johnson's Great Society, the development of the African-American and women's
movements, the disillusionment with politics resulting from Vietnam and
Watergate, and the swing toward conservative politics since the 1970s.  By
studying these and other issues, students should become acquainted with the
forces that have helped shaped their lives and will continue to do so as the
nation heads into the next millennium.

REQUIREMENTS:

The written assignments will consist of two essay exams, a midterm and a
final, and a term paper.  The exams ask students to evaluate generalizations
about critical issues in the history of this period.  Successful answers
require the ability to summarize important information, think critically about
it, and organize your thoughts and write about them clearly.  The tests will
also include short (paragraph) identifications.  The final will not be
cumulative and will cover the material only from the midterm.  There will be
no make-up exams without special permission of the instructor in advance,
which is granted only in unusual circumstances.

 The term paper should be eight pages, typewritten and double spaced.  Choose
a popular magazine such as Newsweek or Time and select the issues that cover
your birth date in the years 1946 and 2000 or 2001.  Examine the articles and
advertisements in each of the two issues and describe and analyze how life in
the post-World War II United States has changed and remained the same.  You
should look for themes that reflect the content of the course, for example,
race, gender, politics, foreign affairs.  Failure to turn in the paper on time
will mean a grade reduction for each day it is late.  The title page of your
paper must contain the following statement: "I understand what plagiarism
means, and I have not engaged in it.  This paper is wholly my own ideas and
writing."  Your signature should follow.

GRADING:

The mid term and final exams each count one-third of the grade for the course,
and the term paper comprises the remaining third.  In borderline cases, I will
take into account improvement on exams as well as class participation.
Students will have ample opportunity to participate in small group as well as
general discussions.

ATTENDANCE will also be related to grades.  You are expected to attend class
and sign a roster at the beginning of each class meeting.  If you are absent
(unexcused) more than four times during the semester you will lose one letter
grade on your final exam.  You are also expected to arrive to class on time.
Each time you accumulate two latenesses it will be considered as an absence.
This policy exists because it is annoying to both the instructor and the class
when students arrive late.

MISCELLANEOUS: You are expected to read and understand the History
Department?s ?Code of Etiquette,? a short version is attached to this
syllabus.  For the longer version, look at the History Department?s web page,
click on "Undergraduate" and then on "Policy on Mutual Responsibilities."

**UNIT ONE:  
_DOMESTICITY AND THE FEMINE IDEAL_**

THROUGHOUT American history, at least since the late seventeenth teenth
century, women have played a disproportionate role in the life of America's
churches. Beginning in the nineteenth century, moreover, women began to assume
even greater importance in the religious sphere, especially in the assumption
of spiritual nurture in the home. This unit examines the construction of the
ideal of feminine spirituality in the nineteenth century, looking also at the
proliferation of new, indigenous religions, many of them led by women.

**UNIT TWO:  
_THE SCOURGE OF THE CITIES_**

AMERICAN culture was convulsed with all manner of social and demographic
changes in the nineteenth century, but none were so wrenching as urbanization,
industrial ization, and the influx of non-Protestant immigrants. This unit
looks at the religious lives of those immigrants and assesses how Protestants
in particular responded to the new arrivals.

_**UNIT THREE:  
_RELIGIOUS RESPONSES TO MODERNITY_**

IT is one of the supreme ironies of American life that evangelicalism, without
question the most important social and religious movement in American history,
is also the most misunderstood and maligned. This unit explores the "patchwork
quilt" of American evangelicalism in all of its diversity. We will trace the
roots of evangelicalism back to the Protestant Reformation and as well as its
evolution into contemporary forms: pentecostalism, fundamentalism, the
holiness impulse, the charismatic movement, and evangelicalism proper. We will
also assess the influence of evangelicalism on popular rhetoric,
communications styles, and American politics.

This unit also contains a comparative perspective, that of Hasidic Jews. We'll
look at how this group clings to "orthodoxy" in the modem world.

mainstream? Or: Compare the subculture of evangelicalism with that of Hasidic
Judaism, as portrayed in _Holy Days._ What, for example, is the role of women
in each subculture?

_**UNIT FOUR:  
_Religion and Race_ **

AFTER THE CRUCIBLE of slavery, American blacks faced other hardships, both in
the South and in the North. The combination of Jim Crow laws and economic
stringencies prompted the great migration to northern cities around the turn
of the century. There, contrary to their expectations, African Americans
encountered new difficulties: unemployment, labor unrest, ghettos, and
poverty. This environment gave rise to all manner of religious expressions,
from the historic forms of the Baptist tradition and the African Methodist
Episcopal Church to the novel combinations of pentecostal fervor with
charismatic religious leadership. Perhaps the most influential movement to
rise from Northern cities was the Nation of Islam, an eclectic combination
drawn from rather diverse sources, ranging from Jehovah's Witnesses and
Garveyism to the Moorish Science Temple and even orthodox Islam; the Nation of
Islam would provide America with one of its most compelling and articulate
leaders of the twentieth century. Back in the South, meanwhile, a young
Baptist minister who had done his graduate work at Boston University
reluctantly accepted the mantle of leadership for what became known as the
Civil Rights movement. This young preacher's odyssey would take him from
Montgomery to Birmingham to Washington and finally to Memphis, where he met an
assassin's bullet in 1968. Along the way, however, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
seared the American conscience with the brutality of racial intolerance.
Because of his efforts and the efforts of his clerical confr6res, America-from
corporate boardrooms to the smallest Georgia backwater-would never be the
same.

**Unit Five:  
_THE NEW PLURALISMS_**

AGAINST the background of Protestant pretensions to cultural hegemony, a new
eclecticism flourishes in American religion, combining elements of Eastern
thought with traditional Christianity and smatterings of New Age
experimentations. The result is a fascinating, if utterly unorthodox,
spirituality that transcends theological, cultural, and ethnic boundaries, a
new frontier in American religious life. In the final unit we will look at the
rise of these new pluralisms since mid-century. _

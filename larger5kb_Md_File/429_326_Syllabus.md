> University policy prohibits giving out grades over the telephone, so
students must not call the Department of Social Work to get test grades. The
only person a student should ask about his/her grades is the professor of the
course the student is inquiring about. DO NOT call the department secretary or
go to her office to ask about grades. If grades are to be posted before the
next class session, they will be posted on the professor's office door. That
is where the student should look to find out if grades have been posted.

early or late, must be proctored by Ms.Terry in Hume 231, the main Social Work

assignments with Ms. Terry at least one day in advance. If the student misses
the scheduled makeup time, the student will have to reschedule with Ms. Terry.

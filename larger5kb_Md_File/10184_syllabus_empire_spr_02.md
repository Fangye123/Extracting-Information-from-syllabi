This course will focus on the history of Rome under the emperors, from
approximately the 40s B.C.E. to the deterioration of the western Empire in the
fifth century C.E. Special emphasis will be given to concepts of power and how
these are demonstrated in politics, gender ideals, material culture and
religious practices of the imperial period. Students will make use of the
primary sources of evidence, both ancient texts and archaeological material,
to increase their understanding of the ancient Romans and to gain greater
familiarity with the techniques of the historian in analysis and
communication.

[Final](finalprep02emp.html): Wednesday, May 8, 8-10 a.m.

Participation: Students are required to attend class, listen thoughtfully, and
take part in classroom activities. Students must purchase of a pack of 3" x5"
lined index cards, which will be used for documentation of participation.

Source Analyses focus on brief analysis of the ancient evidence available for
specified topics, considering such issues as agenda, rhetoric, bias and
credibility of the ancient author and how the treatment of material in the
primary evidence affects our historical awareness. Guidelines and protocol
will be circulated in advance. Due by 5:00 p.m. February 11, March 25 and
April 29.

Examinations: [midterm](midtermprep.html) and final will each be a combination
of identification and essay; you will choose four identification terms and one
essay topic among several presented to you. Study guides will be distributed
in advance, consisting of a number of essay topics from which those appearing
on the exam will be selected. Terms for identification will also be drawn from
these essay topics, in order to allow you to focus your preparation better. A
successful essay must present a thesis and well-organized supporting
arguments, making use of primary sources as documentary evidence; a successful
identification must give the meaning of the term, place it in the appropriate
chronological, geographical, and historical context and explain the
significance of the item for the history of the Roman Imperial period. Final
examination will NOT be cumulative.

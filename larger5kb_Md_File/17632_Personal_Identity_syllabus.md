###  
Course description:  

This course is an investigation into how we should conceive of ourselves as
persons.  This is primarily a  
metaphysical issue, but it also has connections with and implications for
psychology, morality, the  
law, and medicine.  At the core of the discussion is the question: what is it
that makes a person the  
same individual as time goes by?  A full understanding of this issue requires
an historical investigation  
of how people have conceived of personhood in the past, and how they have
treated cases where  
continued personhood was uncertain.  Students will have to chose from the
following list what they  
will concentrate on: the distinction between humans and other animals, the
development of fetuses,  
brain bisection experiments, amnesia and fugues, multiple personality
disorder, schizophrenia,  
Altzheimer's disease and other neurological illnesses, Buddhist conceptions of
"no-self" and nirvana,  
Siamese and identical twins, and possibly "Star Trek" style teletransporter
accidents or the Borg.  We  
will use these cases to understand the philosophical implications (or lack of
them) of theories of  
personal identity.  We will end the semester by looking at the implications of
these theories for our  
understanding of the nature of self-knowledge.  The modern philosophers we
will study are Locke,  
Hume, and Kant.  We will also read contemporary work by philosophers working
on these issues in the  
last two decades.  Students should expect to find themselves intellectually
stretched and challenged.  

###  
Work for the course:  

Students will do research into facts concerning human development over a
lifetime, from conception to  
death, and cases of neurological disorder and mental illness: they will
present this (possibly  
collaborating in groups of 2) to the class in a student presentation with
information handouts  (15%).  
Subsequent written work should use this information in discussion of
philosophical issues of  
personhood.  There will be a mid-term class exam (30%), and a final 10-15 page
(35%) paper.  Students  
must write a draft of their final paper.  For the first half of the semester,
students will have to write  
three 3 page summaries of some of the readings (5% each).  Class participation
will count for 5%.  
Attendance is obligatory (1% of grade lost for each class missed after the
first 2).

**Course Description** : This class will define the difference between
prejudice and oppression and will examine institutional, cultural and personal
oppression. We will also consider resistance to oppression and creativity in
the face of oppression. In particular, the class will focus on racism, sexism,
classism, heterosexism, and anti-Semitism. One important task of the class
will be an exploration of the historical underpinnings of oppressive forces in
contemporary society. That is, we will examine how present social, political
and economic conditions grow from and are shaped by past events. And we will
examine how present reflections might change our interpretations of and
insights into historical events. Through historical, philosophical, and
literary readings; discussions; activities; videos and student presentations,
we will explore personal and cultural identities and how these identities,
along with oppression and privilege based in such identities, intersect.
Strategies for change, on both personal and broader levels, will be
investigated.

Texts:  
Findlen, Barbara. _Listen Up! Voices from the Next Feminist   Generation_  
Kozol, Jonathan. _Savage Inequalities_.  
Spiegelman, Art. _Maus_.  
Zinn, Howard. _A People's History of the United States_.  


Requirements:  
Regular attendance is required along with active class participation. If a
student misses more than two class, he or she may lose points from the final
grade. Students are expected to come to class with the reading done and with
their books.

A take-home midterm examination worth 30% of the grade.

A presentation and final paper (4-6 pages) on a topic related to course
material. For this assignment, you will be responsible for researching an
example of institutional, cultural and/or personal oppression and/or
resistance to it, presenting your findings to the class and explaining the
connection of the event to issues we have considered in class. For example,
you might examine an issue such as Title IX, environmental racism or sexism in
the workplace. Or, you might want to discuss the role of an historical figure
like Amelia Bloomer, Caesar Chavez, Sojourner Truth, or Jackie Robinson.
Another option would be to look at a resistance movement like the Civil Rights
Movement, the women's rights convention at Seneca Falls, the Stonewall
Uprisings, or the history of labor unions. These are just suggestions; the
choice is yours. In any case, you will need to pick a specific focus within
your topic. What is especially important about it? What do you want the class
to think about? This argument should be developed, at least in a first form,
for your presentation and then explored in more depth for your final paper.
You must use at least five sources for your paper, and no more than two of
them can be from the WWW. The presentation will be 10% of the grade and the
final paper 30% (thesis statement: 5%, paper: 25%).

Several homework assignments--typed, double-spaced and 1-2 pages in length--on
topics given below, will make up the final 30% of the grade. I will collect
homework twice during the semester--on February 25 and May 4\. You will have a
choice of assignments each time as described in the schedule of assignments

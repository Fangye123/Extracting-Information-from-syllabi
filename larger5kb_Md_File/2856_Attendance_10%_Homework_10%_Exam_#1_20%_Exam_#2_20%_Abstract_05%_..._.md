Tsujimura, Natsuko. 1996. _An Introduction to Japanese Linguistics_.
Cambridge, MA/Oxford: Blackwell Publishers. Matsumoto, Yo. 1996. _Complex
Predicates in Japanese: A Syntactic and Semantic Study of the Notion "Word"_.
Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications, Center for the Study of Language and
Information.  
Course packet of selected readings, to be purchased at University Book and
Supply. See end of syllabus for contents.

**Course objectives:**  
1\. For those who are studying Japanese, or have some previous knowledge of
Japanese: to gain the ability to look at Japanese language as data. With an
understanding of sound structure, you will know why certain sound changes
happen, and be able to predict where they will occur; with an understanding of
word formation, you will enhance your ability to understand and use compound
words; with a knowledge of syntax, you will be able to easily distinguish
between different types of complex sentences, and working with various phrase
and sentence types should enhance your reading and writing ability in these
areas.  
2\. For those whose interest is linguistic analysis: to work on those aspects
of Japanese language which are of particular interest to linguists from the
perspective of linguistic theory. In the area of phonology, this includes mora
versus syllable, pitch accent, and rendaku (sequential voicing); in
morphology, compound formation and interaction with syntax in the assignment
of postpositions; in syntax, scrambling, anaphora, subject, topic, passive,
causative, relative clauses, and unaccusativity.

**Course requirements:**  
1\. You must read all assigned material and be prepared to discuss it in class
on the day that the reading is listed in the daily schedule.  
2\. Homework exercises must be prepared ahead of time to turn in on the day
indicated on the daily schedule. These will count towards your grade, and will
help you to understand the assigned readings.  
3\. Two exams during the semester.  
4\. A term project, which will be either a research/analysis paper on some
aspect of Japanese language, OR a translation of an article or book chapter
written in Japanese on some aspect of the Japanese language. In either case,
you will be required to turn in an abstract of the project, a first draft of
the project, and present it in class at the end of the semester. a.
research/analysis paper: should be approximately 10-15 pages in length, with
notes and bibliography. Evaluation of this project will be based on the
following:  
i. Topic (selection and clarity of definition)  
ii. Sources (quality and appropriateness)  
iii. Research (how the issues are presented, and previous work described)  
iv. Critical analysis (your data and your own analysis)  
v. Writing (spelling, punctuation, paragraph structure)  
b. translation of an article or book chapter in Japanese. I can help you find
an appropriate work in some area in which you are interested. This option is
recommended only for advanced students of Japanese (third-year or above). This
will not be an easy assignment, and will require a lot of time, so you must
get started early.

achieving human goals that rest on human decisions... All human history is but
a reflection of the workings of ecological principles._ " - Moore (1985).

Welcome to Ecology 206**  
We want to make ECOL. 206 one of the highs in your university education. Some
former students have, in fact, felt that way about it. Others hated it,
because they got lost due to irregular attendance and/or failure to read
assignments on time. Problems can be solved easily if brought to us as soon as
possible. Please keep in touch- tell us how to improve! We each have more
interests in life than time for doing them, but the least demanding course
gets the least of your time and will yield the least value. It may seem
strange, but those who worked the hardest seemed to enjoy the course the most
and returned as volunteer UGTAs.

**Honors credit**  
Attend regular lectures, pick one ECOL 206 lab/field section, and join a
weekly discussion group.

**206H discussion group  
** Organization meeting Mon. 14 January, 1500 (3pm), BSW 101

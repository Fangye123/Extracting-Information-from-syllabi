### STS 121 (Hist. 115):  
Winter 1995-96

_"Technology is indeed a queen; it does change the world."

## Course Description:

**_ This course aims to understand the increasing interpenetration of
technology and daily life in the United States from the American Revolution
through the First World War. It focuses on changes in people's ways of working
and enjoying leisure; of transporting themselves and their goods; of
communicating; of manufacturing things; and of representing and simulating the
world.  
The format will be lecture-discussion. There is an optional Thursday
discussion section to talk at greater length about the assigned readings
(section required for students taking the course for five units).  
To receive credit, students must fulfill all course requirements, e.g. write
both papers, contribute to class discussion, and pass the final exam. (For
further details on the writing assignments, see below).

**_

## Required Reading:

**_ Four books and a reader, all available for purchase at the bookstore and
on reserve in Meyer, are required for the course:  

**     (1) Judith A. McGaw, _Most Wonderful Machine: Mechanization and Social
Change in Berkshire Paper Making, 1801-1885

_      (2) Wolfgang Schivelbusch, _The Railway Journey: Trains and Travel in
the 19th Century_ ;

     (3) JoAnne Yates, _Control through Communication: The Rise of System in American Management_ ; 

     (4) David E. Nye, _Electrifying America: Social Meanings of a New Technology_ ;

** Plan to complete your reading assignments by the first class meeting of the
week the readings are assigned; this will enhance your learning in class and
enable you to participate in an informed way in any discussion. **_Note_ :
**occasionally during the quarter, the "documentary sources" in the latter
part of the reader will serve as the basis of class discussion. **On days for
which one or more documentary sources is assigned, please read and study them
in advance and bring your reader to class.  
**  
**_

## Written Assignments:

**_ **_Two Papers_ : **I am asking you to write two short (4-6 pp.) essays,
each to be based on the analysis of a technical periodical. For your first
paper, choose a technical periodical from the era 1800-1860, and for your
second essay, select one from the period 1880-1920 (I'll handout bibliography
later). **Essay #1 is due on Tuesday, Jan. 30th, while essay #2 is due on
Tuesday, Feb. 27th. Late papers may be penalized.**  
**_Background_ :** Americans in the nineteenth century loved information, and
just as today, the cultural environment especially favored the magazine or
periodical format. Coverage of technical matters proved extremely popular, and
periodicals reported on new inventions, recorded technical debates, and
disseminated advice on everything from constructing railroads to refinishing
marble tables, from extracting aluminum to preserving pears.  
After familiarizing yourself with this kind of periodical, select an
interresting article or magazine issue on which to base your paper. Your task
then is to carry out a close reading of the text (and/or its graphics) in
order to demonstrate how it might be reflective of American culture. In other
words, you are to read your article or magazine as a cultural text,
interpreting it as a cultural production from the 1820s, the 1850s, the 1900s,
or whatever period it comes from. Although I do not require research for this
paper, you obviously will be evaluating your text in the the context of the
history covered by the required reading for the course and that discussed in
lecture.  
**_Specific Approach_ :** There is no single way to interpret an article or
periodical as a cultural text, but the following questions may help you get
started ( _Do not feel obliged, however, to answer all of these--or even any
of them_ ):  

     1) What social, cultural, or economic conditions in the United States might help explain the article's subject or the particular technical device which may be under discussion?  
     2) What evidence does the article provide of the "social shaping" of technology, that is, of the different social groups or communities that influenced how the technology develops, is used, etc.?   
     3) Who is the author, or whom does he (most but not all authors will be men) seem to be, and on whose behalf does he seem to be speaking?   
     4) _To whom_ does the article appear to speak, that is, who are the "implied readers" for whom the author is writing? Does the text specifically allude to particular kinds of readers, and what sort of attitudes toward or relationships with the technology does the author presume these people to have?   
     5) If the article is about a recent invention, how does the text envision the future uses or consequences of the new technology, and what do those expectations reveal about American culture at the time?   
     6) Viewing your particular article, or the periodical itself, as an "information technology," what might its prose style, typographical layout, or graphics say about the culture of the era? Where does this particular information technology come from?

**_

## Final Exam and Grading:

**_ The final exam is on Wednesday, March 20th, from 8:30-11:30 a.m. It will
consist of short and long essays, and will cover the entire course. You will
have a choice on all questions. The exam will count approximately 40% of your
grade, the two papers approximately 50%, and your contribution to discussion
approximately 10%.

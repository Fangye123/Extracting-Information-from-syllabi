1933 elections - won by conservatives  

  * under clerical leader Gil Robles  

  * Falange f. - Spanish fascist party  

  * "In an electoral system that heavily favoured coalitions, the decision of the Socialists to go it alone in the elections of November 1933 was a tragic error. It gave power to a right-wing determined to dismantle the Republic's social reforms. Employers and landowners celebrated the victory by cutting wages, sacking workers, evicting tenants and raising rents. The largest party, the Catholic CEDA, wasn't offered power because the Republican president suspected its leader, Jose Maria Gil Robles, of harbouring fascist ambitions to establish an authoritarian, corporative state. Thus, the conservative Radical Party ruled. " (Paul Preston 1996)

  * 1500 dead, 800 wounded  

  * old town completely destroyed but arms plant and railroad were undamaged, and the symbolic Basque tree and Basque archives were also undamaged  

  * done by German Condor Legion at suggestion of Franco, not Hitler. The Nationalists denied the bombing and attempted to put the blame on the Republicans or the Basques. This is the argument of Luis Brolin in his 1967 book **_Spain, the Vital Years_**. 
  * The story written by George Steer for the London _Times_ April 27 and reprinted in the New York _Times_ April 28 put the blame on the fascists and created the myth of Guernica as the innocent victim of a terrorist bombing: "Guernica was not a military objective.... The object of the bombardment was seemingly the demoralisation of the civil population and the destruction of the cradle of the Basque race." However, Hugh Thomas in his 1961 book **_The Spanish Civil War_** , and Phillip Knightley in his 1975 book **_The First Casualty_** , argue that it was bombed for tactical military objectives. 

May 31, 1937 - German warships killed 19 in a bombardment of the Republican
coastal town of Almeria, in retaliation for the bombing of the German
battleship _Deutschland,_ and in June, after the German cruiser _Leipzig_
claimed it was attacked by Republican submarines, Germany and Italy withdrew
from the joint naval patrol that had been established by the Non-Intervention
Committee in April.

This article is critical of the Ken Loach film _Land and Freedom_ that argues "the fight of the brigaders and of the Spanish people was not a fight against Spanish fascism and its German and Italian allies, but rather part of an internecine leftist in which the central enemy was the Communist Party. Despite many merits, Loach's script seems oblivious of two central facts about the Spanish civil war: in its origins, it was a Spanish social war and, in its course and outcome, it was an episode in a greater European civil war that ended in 1945."

**Creating a Webpage Syllabus**  
  
  

  
This module is designed to take the place of a formal presentation in the
Instructional Effectiveness Program (IEP). It is available free for use by all
faculty, students, and staff at Oklahoma State University. All participants
who wish to obtain course credit or a certificate for completion IEP and who
wish to count this module, as part of their work will complete the activities
related to this module.  
  
**Participation Requirements** : Access to a computer, which has Internet
access and email capability is necessary. All IEP modules are product based so
you should expect to create products as the result of completing this module.

**Performance Objectives**  
  
1\. Modify an outline of a syllabus for a course, which you would like to
teach with Internet assistance. [This will probably be the syllabus you
created for the traditional syllabus module but this is not a requirement.]
Include the following in your outline:  
............ a. The amount of content/resources, which you will use from the
Internet (Is the course Web supported, Web-centric, or fully online?)  
............b. Provide of the components you would include in your online
syllabus. Include the URLs and a 4-8-line description of:  
....................... 1) Three resources which you have found on the
Internet and recommend for students in this course. (Note that web searching
is described ___<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/cml30-1>_ if you
have not done this before.)  
....................... 2) One Internet resource, which illustrates what, can
be learned in your discipline.  
....................... 3) One discussion list or chat room which would be
appropriate for students in either the course you are proposing or the
discipline.  
.......................4) Three activities from the Internet which would be
appropriate for your course.  
.......................5) Outline of three local links to which you would
link.  
.......................6) Any modifications that you feel are needed to change
the original syllabus to one appropriate for the Internet including directions
on how to use the resources that you have found.

**COMPONENTS OF A WEBPAGE SYLLABUS**  
  
The Computer Mediated Learning (CML) Webpage Syllabus should contain all of
the required components of the regular syllabus plus any of the optional
requirements that you feel are necessary for your course. Listed below are the
components of a traditional syllabus which need to be modified to describe a
course using CML and some of the possible components of a CML Syllabus which
are either unique to CML or which need to be modified for use in CML. See
_<http://www.hcc.hawaii.edu/hccinfo/facdev/WriteSyllabus.html>_ for an example
of how to write a web syllabus. Note that the starred items are part of the
traditional syllabus. Unstarred items are new for the CML syllabus.  
  
**COURSE INFORMATION**  
  
**Plug in Page** : It is necessary up front to indicate what the minimum
hardware requirements for accessing and participating in the online course
will be and which, if any, downloadable viewers will be needed on the
students' computer. Links to a download page for a needed viewer allows the
student to easily follow instructions. See
_<http://www2.ncsu.edu/bae/people/faculty/walker/hotlist/graphics.html>_. To
find plugins see _<http://www.creativegood.com/help/c064.html>__._ This page
would contain links to all of the plugins that the student would need to load
for the course. See _<http://www.online.ddce.cqu.edu.au/west/config.htm>_. Be
sure to specify all of the plug ins which students will need and either
provide links to pages where they can be found or direct downloads in the
syllabus.  
  
**INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION**  
***Instructor Name, Office Hours, and Biography:** Electronic office hours
should be listed, if provided. In some courses, with some students, the
instructor may also need to spend some space convincing students that coming
to office hours electronically does not brand them as slow. Learners, in our
competitive society, needing help or assistance may see the receipt of that
help as a sign that they are weak or incompetent. To avoid this stigma they
may not seek help when it is needed. Provide a picture of the instructor as
well as information about research interests, background. Instructors may want
to provide a bibliography of work so students begin to feel that they know
something about them. A curriculum vita may be appropriate. (See
******<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/bullvita>****)**. Sharing
your vita may also be useful for recruiting students to work on research
teams.  
  
***Telephone Numbers (Office and Home):** Students should be able to contact
the instructor or leave a message either with a secretary or on voice mail.
This is particularly important when beginning a course, which is Web enhanced,
as many students may have problems with equipment, which the instructor or
technical staff will need to resolve. If you can provide a 7 X 24-hour phone
this will be greatly appreciated by beginning students. OSU Computer
Information Services will provide telephone help on supported software at
405-744-7836.  
  
***Email Address:** We assume that instructors will provide email addresses.
Will synchronous office hours be provided? If yes, will these be email only,
chat room, phone, in person, or some combination of the above? If asynchronous
office hours are planned, how often will the instructor logon for this
purpose? The teacher should be explicit here so that the students will know
how long they will have to wait before they will have answer questions or
address problems. The more frequently the instructor is available, the lower
students' stress levels will be, and the less delay they will experience in
developing the materials, which are needed for completion of the course.
Remember that a question unresolved usually means that the student is stuck
until resolution. List days (Saturday and/or Sunday) when email will not be
checked so students will know when to expect a response. Some instructors may
want to have an electronic open door policy, but they should provide times
when they do not have to answer email.  
  
***Expectations (Instructor)** : In the electronic environment the teacher
must specify the number of logons, and the number of postings that are
expected from the students for a grade of "X." Are there requirements for
weekly meetings or for weekly logons? Do email messages need to be posted on
some schedule? Do students need to respond to other student's wok before some
deadline? Make sure that you spell out all of your expectations in the
syllabus.  
  
***Typical Amount of Work Expected in the CML Course:** A typical class
requires three hours out of class for every hour in class. In a CML course you
must expect to add the traditional out-of-class time to the in-class time to
come up with the typical amount of time. A one-credit course for example is
expected to meet for 16 hours, at three hours out for one in the outside time
would be 48 hours. The typical expected then would be 64 hours. Then it is
likely that more time would have to be added if the students were
technologically unsophisticated or if the course is collaborative and students
have to learn to work collaboratively with each other.  
  
**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
**Course Advertising:** When the syllabus functions as a Webpage for a course,
it should begin with a segment, which advertises the course. See
_<http://www.nyu.edu:80/classes/garbage/>__._ This information should be
provided at the top of the syllabus or in a header so that it will be easily
accessible to search engines, which may only pick up the first 100-200
characters on a page. Note that you may not see what is in the header but the
search engine will. Some search engines record the whole document, others only
headers or the first segment of a page. If you are drawing students at a
distance they need to find the course first. To assist students from other
locations, include information about how to access the course, its tuition,
start date, and other necessary details. The syllabus should contain
hyperlinks to appropriate sites so interested students can find other
necessary course information such as registration forms, etc. If you use a
colored background and make the type of the advertising in the same color the
search engines will see it only.  
  
**Course Notice Boards** : Course notice boards are useful for posting new
information during the semester. They can also be used before the semester
starts to post the syllabus, information about prerequisites, events, and
opportunities which students can participate in before the course which will
facilitate their learning in the course, etc. Early postings on the notice
board should be linked to the departmental or school web page so that students
can find the information before the course starts. Teachers in fully and
partially webbed courses may also want to consider setting up a listserv
early, as students register for the course, to contact students and provide
any needed information as well as a welcome to the course. If students have
email addresses this can be easily accomplished at any time in the
preregistration process. See as an example of a notice board at
_<http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/notice/index.html>_ or  
_<http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~ceilidh/course.swt/index.html>__._ Describe the
things your students should use the course notice board for.  
  
***Course Purpose/Preamble** : Start by telling the students that this is an
online course. Describe why it is online; what it is that the students' gain
by having this presentation medium. Why does the course exist in this form?
Who are the students who are likely to take the course in this format?  
  
**Table of Contents:** Provide a table of contents or an index if the syllabus
has many pages or page groupings (8 or more). For an example of a main index
see _<http://sanda.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS/index.html>_. For a large syllabus
start with a flow or block diagram of the components. For example see
_<http://128.172.170.24/gj/201/201.html>_. This will allow the use of the
fewest number of levels when linking pages together. Students should not have
to go through many levels or pages to get to the specific page they need to
read. Too many levels cause learner frustration. The table of contents should
not be more than three levels deep unless the syllabus is very large when you
are using the TIOD to link to syllabus components.  
  
**Course Map/Website Map** : The course map is an alternative to a table of
contents. Sometimes it may represent a building with a variety of locations,
for example see ( _<http://itrc.uwaterloo.ca/~engl210e/>_ _)._ Usually a
course map is graphical rather than outlined text, which is beneficial for
some visually oriented learners. See for example
_<http://www.cl.uh.edu/INST5931/>__._ It may, in fact, be useful to provide
both a course map and a table of contents and let the students select which
one they want to use. For those who are unsure about this, try putting a
counter (h _ttp://www.spiceisle.com/homepages/candw_gd/VisitorCounter.htm_ )
on the table of contents and the site map and see if they both get use. ****  
  
***Course Objectives and Outline** (For an example objectives page see
_<http://edutech.educ.msu.edu/vital/syllabus.html>__._ )  
  
***Style/Mode of Teaching** : In a CML course, this is extremely important to
specify when students must be online, if specific times are required, as some
learners may not have access to the appropriate equipment all of the time
(some may use office equipment or may be at work on evening shifts). In Web-
assisted and Web-enhanced courses the student needs to know which parts of the
course must be accessed using the computer and if there are alternative ways
in which materials can be acquired. The various course structures are
collaborative-teacher directed, collaborative-learner directed,
individualized-teacher directed, individualized-learner directed, asynchronous
teacher directed, asynchronous learner directed, group synchronous-teacher
directed, group synchronous-group directed, and a variety of combinations of
these. You should spell out the way in which you will teach so that students
will know how the class will operate before they enroll.  
  
***Purpose of Class Meetings:** Class meetings take on a different form for
online courses. If the course is synchronous, describe how students logon and
what they are supposed to do when they arrive. What are the procedures and why
should the students do them? In asynchronous courses tell students that there
are no specifically timed meetings unless the students themselves set them up.
This allows students to do synchronous activities but does not require them.
Describe the purpose of being online and what the students are to do so that
they will be successful.  
  
**Participate in a Chat Room:** Students can participate in chat rooms in the
same way that they join discussion lists. A teacher may develop a chat room
for the class so that members can interact synchronously (see tips at
_<http://www.siec.k12.in.us/~west/edu/chat.htm>_ ). There may also be chat
rooms that individuals may wish to join, based on their interests within the
discipline, which are available on the Internet (see
_<http://www.jasonproject.org/front.html>_ ). Because chat rooms are
synchronous activities and ephemeral (discussions are not usually saved) the
interactions are different from those in a more permanent medium. Chat room
discussions are likely to be more affective than cognitive and more social
than academic. Chat rooms and virtual cafes are useful in developing social
interaction between students, which fosters the development of collaboration.
Social interaction is the glue that binds teams together and its fostering is
a necessary component of collaborative learning. Procedures for using chat
rooms, including net etiquette, should be linked to or described in the
syllabus.  
  
**Participate in a Web Conference:** There are many web conferences that are
available on the Internet, see
_<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/conference>_ for a web conference
on computer mediated learning in which anyone can participate. Some
conferences require that people register and pay a fee for participation and
others are available to anyone who is interested in participating. The basic
idea of the web conference is to share ideas or answers to questions on a
given focused topic. Should students participate in conferences as part of the
course?  
  
**Participate in a Class Web Conference** : Whether the course provided is a
Web supported, Web-centric or a totally online course it may be necessary to
get all the students together for periodic discussion. This is usually done
when interaction is asynchronous and there is a need for synchronous
interaction. If possible, this kind of an event should be scheduled when the
syllabus is written and the links to the conference site or chat room should
be embedded in the syllabus. See threaded discussion at
_<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/conference/>__._  
  
**Bookmarking to Share Information:** Teach students to bookmark important
ideas to come back to later. This requires annotation of bookmarks, which can
be done by pasting the URL into a word processing program, using control c (to
copy) and control v (to paste), and then typing in the annotation. Students
should also keep a list of things to think about or review as they peruse
electronic material. (See ****_<http://www.unc.edu/courses/jomc154/errors>_ on
how to create bookmarks **).** Students should share bookmark lists with
others when learning and Internet searching is collaborative rather than
competitive. Bookmarks are addresses (or URLs) of interesting sites on the
Internet or other electronic network. A series of lessons on creating
bookmarks can be seen at _<http://dune.srhs.k12.nj.us/WWW/bkmark1.htm>__,_
_<http://dune.srhs.k12.nj.us/WWW/bkmark1a.htm>_ ,
_<http://dune.srhs.k12.nj.us/WWW/bkmark2.htm>_ , and
_<http://dune.srhs.k12.nj.us/WWW/bkmark3.htm>_. When individuals search the
net they should mark the sites of interest which they would like to show or
which they would like to return to at a later time. Each focused search should
yield a number of sites which have information related to the focus question
or concept. It is the list of these sites that students may want to share. If
each member of a class searches a different focus question and shares the
bookmark list all class members can be brought up to speed on what has been
found. Other members do not have to review a lot of sites, which are not
pertinent to the focus, because the individual who created the bookmark list
has culled out all of those that did not apply. Bookmark lists can also be
used to set the sequence in which sites should be visited. In this usage the
one who created the list has some reason for presenting the sites in a
particular pattern and the sequenced bookmarks will lead others through the
sequence if other learners follow it. To find out how to manage a bookmark
list see
_<http://medstat.med.utah.edu/navigator/netscape/bkmk31/bkmk31.html>_.  
  
***List of Key Concepts:** See
_<http://www.cryst.bbk.ac.uk/PPS2/glossary/index.html>_. Concept lists are
helpful in CML because learners do not have to pose questions to the group or
the instructor when they do not understand. This saves time and insures that
the shy students will have some idea of what the terms mean. In control
settings (those following traditional instructional design principles) the
instructor should post the key concepts list. In collaborative settings anyone
who has had a problem with a concept or who has received an email from a
classmate along the lines of  "What the ______ _______ does this word mean?"
can post the concept, definition, and examples to the list. In collaborative
settings students should be warned that some definitions might be
idiosyncratic unless a source for the definition is provided. (See Netspeak
for Internet terms at _<http://sunsite.unc.edu/horizon/mono>__/CD/_
Internet_Glossaries/lingo.html or a content based hyperglossary at
_<http://www.cryst.bbk>__.ac.uk/PPS2/ glossary/index.html_ ). For many classes
there may be an existing concept list or glossary on the Internet. If these
are available students should be directed to them.  
  
**Bulletin Boards for Questions** **(Points to Students who Answer):**
Asynchronous interactivity involves two or more interacting at different times
through the use of email, threaded discussions, Listservs, bulletin boards
(see rules for bulletin boards at
_<http://www.pathfinder.com/help/hmember/rulesroad.html>_ and how to use them
_<http://pathfinder.com/help/hbb/index.html>_ ) etc. This approach provides
for more thoughtful interaction. Learners can think about and craft their
responses in this setting. It is more convenient timewise and in terms of
machine access. It is more adaptable as it can be used in many different ways.
It works better internationally and when there are a number of time zones
between those who would interact. And it required less and lower bandwidth, as
it does not require the maintenance of two-way communication. When students
have questions they can post them to the question bulletin board. Other
students who answer the questions on the board and by email can be given
points as an incentive. The teacher should have the students who post the
questions time mark and date their questions. After 48 hours if peers have not
answered the question the teacher should provide the answer. If you decide to
use this feature it should be described in the syllabus.  
  
**Buddy Programs for Questions** : When starting a unit with new learners, the
teacher may want to pair up those who have some experience with novice
learners. The more experienced learner can help the novice trouble shoot
problems, usually with the equipment or programs. This is a mentor/buddy
program. A straight buddy program pairs together those who have no experience.
With a mentor/buddy program they are encouraged to work side by side to learn.
This way they quickly see that both have problems but that problems can be
overcome.  
  
**Faculty Homepages:** Faculty homepages are Internet pages, which are
developed by faculty to describe who they are, their research interests, and
professional history. There may be links to or pages for an autobiography,
curriculum vita, articles and presentations, research team affiliations,
courses taught, and other professional activities. Faculty provides homepages
for linking to the syllabus for informational purposes, when acting as
mentors, and when serving as resources to students for a variety of
educational activities. See
_<http://education.okstate.edu/coe/leh/leh.htm>__._ You should insure that at
least you provide a link to your own home page. For example,
_<http://home.okstate.edu/homepages.nsf/toc/kaybull>__._  
  
**Homepage Links** : Homepage links might include the instructor's homepage,
the departmental homepage, the college homepage, and the university homepage
(see for example _<http://www.cee.umn>. edu/dis/courses/MICE5309_5000_01.www/_
). Links to the library catalogue allow students to go directly from the
syllabus to the library for needed references and/or materials. Links to other
class members' homepages allows students information about the interests and
background of their classmates. Student home pages are particularly important
in setting up collaborative team projects. Students feel more comfortable when
they know something about the people with whom they are working. See
_<http://www.agfor.unimelb.edu.au/students/1996/semester2/>__._ Include all of
the applicable online links in your syllabus.  
  
***Hardware/Software Requirements** : The level of sophistication and the
bandwidth requirements of the materials used in the course will determine
hardware and software requirements. The more
audio/video/multimedia/simulations/virtual reality that is needed the
larger/faster/newer the computer needs to be and the greater the amount of
memory is needed on the motherboard. Students will need at least a 486-model
computer if they are to deal with more than email as part of the course. If
graphics and full motion video are planned the largest available computer will
probably be needed. Modems should be at least 28.8 (KB per sec.). Faster
modems are available and may soon be able to be used remotely, off of a LAN.
However, only those, which connect to a T-1, ADSL, or a T-3 line, should be
expected to receive motion video or motion simulations and multimedia in
remote locations. (Note that T-1 and T-3 lines are very expensive and
individuals cannot usually afford them.) Phone lines will not easily carry
motion because of the bandwidth needed. (For an example of hardware and
software requirements see _<http://www.tgsa.com/require.html>__)_. Spell out
all of the hardware, software, and plugins which students will need to
participate in your course. For those with old (small memory) computers a
course may not be usable if it requires too much hard drive space or ROM
memory.  
  
***Interactive Course Calendar** : Fully webbed courses should have an
interactive course calendar. This allows the instructor to modify the calendar
as the course goes along. It also allows the students to suggest that they
need more instruction or exposure to the material before they go on. This is
particularly true in synchronous courses. In many classes students really want
to have some time together. In a distance learning course this can only happen
in a synchronous CML environment. The interactive schedule can be used in
conjunction with email to set up a chat room where all who want can
participate in a real time interactive process on class issues. Describe the
processes you want students to use when they request changes or modifications
to the calendar or when they want to hold synchronous discussions with all or
some of their colleagues.  
  
**INSTRUCTOR EXPECTATION INFORMATION**  
  
**Instructor's Announcement Page (What's New Page)** : If the course changes
frequently, or if students have lots of questions about an assignment, or if
students have questions before an exam, etc., have an announcements page. Here
new information can be posted a list of questions included in the FAQ and
other items of immediate interest to the students. This is also the place to
post the answers to homework items which students have turned in. Be sure to
tell students how often they should check the announcement's page (at least
weekly)  
  
**Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)** : As students progress through the
course the instructor will get questions, which will be asked by a number of
students. Typically, the best way to deal with these questions is to create a
FAQ page that can be linked to the syllabus. Stock responses for most
questions can be posted and pasted into email if the students fail to read the
FAQ. In the long run this is a real time saver for the instructor, if the
course is large. See _<http://fiddle.ee.vt.edu/courses/ee5516>_. In some
disciplines, there are a set of commonly asked questions which novices ask
which should be included on the discipline page. FAQ's could concern research,
alternative theories, questions asked in beginning or intermediate courses,
etc. As students ask questions electronically you can post the questions and
the answers to the FAQ page and then refer other students to the page instead
of having to repeatedly answer the same question. New students can read the
FAQ's to get an idea of the problems or issues, which are being discussed in
the discipline in the department. See _<http://pages.prodigy.com/PAUM88A/>_
See FAQ's on whiteboard technology at
_<http://reality.sgi.com/annee_esd/inperson/IP.board.html>_.  
_<http://sparkleinc.com/mlcenter/faq.htm>_ Describe your FAQ and how you will
notify students of new postings in the syllabus.  
  
**Tips and Tricks Bulletin Board** : In many courses students figure out new
ways to create materials, projects, or solve problems. These tips and tricks
can be posted to a bulletin board to be shared by others in the class.
Archives from of the bulletin board can be used to facilitate the development
of future classes. The more tricks the students know the better they will do
and the farther they can go in the class. Teachers may also want to have
student post the URLs of good web sites to the bulletin board when they find
helpful material when web searching. Note that this kind of bulletin board
will not function well under competition. If you use a TTBB describe in the
syllabus the incentives you will provide for those who post information, if
any.  
  
**INFORMATION ABOUT ASSIGNMENTS**  
  
***Assignments:** Online assignments are sometimes different from those that
are created in traditional classes. They can be presented on web pages,
emailed, or otherwise electronically communicated. You will need to specify
the ways in which you will accept assignments in your class or you may get
them in ways that you cannot read.  
  
***Homework:** An instructor may want to have a link to homework problems.
Post problems weekly or more frequently. Posting homework problems forces
students to get on the computer. Also, the teacher can post answers to the
homework after the due date has past for students to check their answers.
Electronic homework submission allows students immediate access the correct
answers and immediate feedback. Homework help may also be available (see
_<http://www.unc.edu/courses/jomc050/homework.html>_ for a homework help page
for public school students).  
  
**Example Homework Page:** The example homework page is useful when the course
is being advertised before the semester starts. By showing examples of the
kinds of homework, which are required teachers can assist students in making
correct decisions about whether or not to enroll in the course. This will
reduce student frustration and help to insure that the correct students select
the course.  
  
**New Homework Page** : An instructor may want to have a link to homework
problems. Post problems weekly or more frequently. Posting homework problems
forces students to get on the computer. Also, the teacher can post answers to
the homework after the due date has past for students to check their answers.
Electronic homework submission allows students immediate access the correct
answers and immediate feedback. Homework help may also be available (see
_<http://www.unc.edu/courses/jomc050/homework.html>_ ).  
  
**Worked Homework Page** : The worked homework page is useful in courses that
have regular assignments with single correct answer questions. Following the
time when assignments are turned in the teacher can post the correct answers
so that the students will get immediate feedback on their success with the
assignment.  
  
**Collections of Solved Problems:** If students are asked to solve problems,
teachers should provide them with solved problems with the work shown. In
mathematics and in other problem based disciplines providing copies of solved
problems is effective in improving student learning. See
_<http://www.webcom.com/dosoris/>_. If you want students to contribute to the
solved problems site, provide an explanation of the incentives, if any, which
you will provide.  
  
**Products Requested in the Syllabus** : Teachers should spell out in detail
all of the products that they want. The more detail provided the more likely
the student will be to be able to figure it out. This means that the
instructor will have increased likelihood of receiving the desired product in
the desired format. It is usually best to start with products that are easily
developed. Beginning with small tasks allows the students to learn to use the
technology and helps to insure that they will be able to complete and get
satisfaction from the initial tasks. Provide links to example products created
by previous classes of students when possible.  
  
**Keep Student Activity Records:** An activities log can be used for a grade,
part of a portfolio, or a reflective learning project. An activities log
details what students did on line and where they explored. In some classes,
students are asked to explore the Internet and look for particular kinds of
information. Here an activities log may be a copy of the places that the
student visited, as evidenced by his/her bookmarks. If you use this procedure
it should be described in the syllabus.  
  
***Extra Credit opportunities:** Many extra credit opportunities can be linked
to resources on the Internet to provide a start for the students who are
researching them  
  
**INFORMATION ABOUT EXAMINATIONS**  
  
**Prerequisite Knowledge (Pretest):** In an electronic format the instructor
may wish to include a pretest which students grade or a self test which the
student would grade to insure that he/she had the appropriate background
skills and knowledge's. See evaluation worksheet at (
_<http://www.EDsOasis.org/Spotlight/Chaparro/Chaparro.html>_ **)** This allows
students to select out of a course if they cannot do the entry level required
work. Both the instructor and the students will feel better if this is done.
If it is not done the instructor should provide appropriate remedial
instruction as needed. Some instructors use diagnostic examinations as part of
a computer aided assessment process where the computer controls the difficulty
level of the assessment using a hierarchical difficult item set to stretch the
student cognitively and to assess the point at which the student will fail.
The purpose of this kind of assessment is to use diagnosis testing to route
the student around material that the student knows and thereby providing
appropriate levels of challenge and difficulty. If a pretest is required
describe it, and its purpose in the syllabus.  
  
**Practice Examinations Online** : To assist students in understanding how
they will be assessed many provide practice and real examinations online.
Those who use teacher created assessment may want to provide access to test
items (usually multiple choice, matching, or true false) to which learners can
respond for practice when they have completed studying a section of material.
This provides some reinforcement to the learner and validates his/her study
procedures when the correct answers are supplied. Assessment items like this
should be self checking, either with an answer key, linked to the self-
assessment page, or a computer driven response checker which scores the items
as the students take the assessment. If the later approach is used, the
instructor may wish to record the attempts. An error analysis may be helpful
in redesigning materials if the students fail to learn key concepts. (See
_<http://www.academyonline.com/academy/athens/latin/sample/sample1.htm>_ ).
Practice examinations are useful for anxiety reduction and for teaching
examination formats to students. See _<http://www.usd.edu/exam/>_. If practice
examinations are to be made available you should describe their purpose in the
syllabus.  
  
***Examination Review Sessions:** Review sessions will be different if they
are conducted online rather than in a traditional classroom. Will the reviews
be synchronous? If yes, will they be by telephone over the Internet or will
they use a chatroom, or a virtual space. The ways in which they will proceed
will differ depending on the mode and you will need to explain the process to
students.  
  
***Online Examinations:** If examinations are put on line, there are programs
which will randomly present multiple choice items, with a different set for
each student, and score the student responses to the items. Other programs
will reorder the response choices while leaving the stems the same. See
_<http://www.unc.edu/courses>__/ssp/tips/testing.html_ for tips on online
testing. For sam

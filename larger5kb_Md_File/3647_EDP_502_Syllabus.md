> ##  2\. Background to Course

>

> **Prerequisites:**

>   1. Previous work in epistemology or philosophy of science OR experience
with the real world.

>   2. Previous work in research methods or statistics OR ever having wondered
why or if something was true or false.

>   3. Previous work in statistics or mathematics or a fear of either.

>   4. An attitude and set of behaviors that reflect valuing of scholarship
and understanding.

>

> **Goals:**

  1. to be able to compute (via computer) and interpret common summary statistics and elementary inferential statistics
  2. to develop an understanding of the basic principles of data analysis and statistics sufficient enough to understand and critique educational research using these techniques.

>  
> **Individual Differences:**

>      Any participant in this course who has a disability that may prevent
him or her from fully demonstrating his or her abilities should contact me
personally as soon as possible so we can discuss accommodations necessary to
ensure full participation and facilitate your educational process.

> **Philosophy:**

>   1. **This course is about empowering** participants to take charge of
interpreting and assessing quantitative information. We live in a quantitative
world. The more you know, the less you can be manipulated by jerks who know
the language but may or may not know appropriate interpretation.

>   2. **Participants must work like dogs** to learn this. Anyone I know that
understands anything well has worked their butt off to do it. This course is
no different.

>   3. **Learning all the details is not enough**. Participants should ask
themselves about the bigger questions, seek clarifications, root out
contradictions \-- use all the reasoning skills you would be expected to use
in any other class.

>   4. To be worthwhile, this must be connected to what you, or someone you
know, does or will be doing. **Only you can make it relevant to your
experience**. Ask and prod the instructor as needed.

>   5. **This course is not about mathematics.** This course is about rigorous
thinking that uses the tools of mathematics. If you are too freaked out by
math to think straight in class, you should consider work through the course
once without a grade (auditing).

>   6. A good understanding can be had by almost all, an excellent
understanding takes a very special effort.

> ##  3\. Achieving Success

> ###  How to Fail this Class:

>   1. Take a lot of other courses or obligations

>   2. Keep the content alienated from the rest of your life

>     * Don't look at the distribution of your monthly costs

>     * Don't think about variability in other people's behavior

>     * Don't critically evaluate what the instructor says

>   3. Memorize facts, avoid focusing on understanding or meaning.

>   4. Do not ask questions-office hours are only for nerds

>   5. Do not read more than you have to

>   6. Do not do more problems than what have been assigned

>   7. Do not experiment with procedures or ideas

>

>

> **Requirements:**

>

> 1\. Participation in Class  
> In addition to lecture time during which the professor will attempt to grace
you with his wisdom, class time will include working on problems and
discussions in small and large groups. Participation is essential for reaping
the full benefits possible from the class.

>

> 2\. Successfully complete homework assignments or in-class quizes  
> Homework will be given daily. When it is handed in it will be graded under
one of three categories:

>   * good or excellent or some other sticker appropriate category

>   * good, but some parts need to be redone

>   * unacceptable -- no credit given

>

Homework is almost always graded in the first two categories, the third
category is reserved for people who simply hand something in because it is
required, but didn't work hard enough to warrant my reading their work.  
> Students are allowed to have to unacceptable or missing homework
assignments. Any combination of missing or unacceptable homework assignments
greater than leads to loss of homework points for grading.

>

> 3\. Successfully complete journal article critiques  
> Because a primary goal of this course is to begin to understand educational
research, students must begin to read and critique published research. One
critique will address an article based on simple summary (descriptive)
statistics discussed in the first half of the course, the second paper will
critique an article that uses inferential statistics discussed in the second
half of the course. The paper selected for critique must be from a journal
devoted to either education research or research in the student's major field
of study.

>

> 5\. Two tests will be given, a midterm and a final.  These will be in class
tests for about 1-1/2 hours.

>

> 6.  A data analysis project will be completed.  (Don't get excited.)  Two or
three papers should be reviewed for a litureature review.  Some basic analyses
will be included.  Different methods of presenting results will be used.
These projects will be presented in class (5-10 minutes.)  The details of this
project will be given later.  
>  
>

> Assigning a letter grade:  
> Homework points if less than 3 assignments missing/unacceptable 10  
> Paper 1 15  
> Paper 2 15  
> Midterm 30  
>  Final 30  
> Total 100

>

> 92 points or higher -> Excellent -> A  
> 80 points to 91 points -> Good - > B  
> 70 points to 79 points -> Average -> C  
> 60 points to 69 points -> Passing -> D  
> Below 60 points -> Failure -> E  
> A grade of "I" for incomplete is only given for "illness or other conditions
beyond the student's control" (ASU General Catalog pg 45).

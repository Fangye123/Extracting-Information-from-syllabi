##  PURPOSE AND GOALS OF THE COURSE:

This course will acquaint participants with the definition and meaning of
human knowledge and its relationship with culture. It will examine the
cultural background and influence of three major scientific achievements:

  * Euclidean geometry in Ancient Greece,
  * Newtonian mechanics in seventeenth and eighteenth century Europe,
  * Darwin's theory of evolution for nineteenth and twentieth century Europe.

In addition, the course will increase the "cultural literacy" of participants
by use of classic literary and dramatic texts.

## PART I  
ANCIENT GREECE:  
WHAT IS THE NATURE OF REALITY?

PART I of the course explores Euclidean geometry as a major scientific
achievement by 1) examining its cultural setting, specifically attempts to
deal with the concepts of fate, necessity, order, justice and rationality in
Ancient Greek religion, drama, law, music, architecture and philosophy and 2)
showing the effects, strengths and limitations of the Euclidean axiomatic-
deductive-systematic model for later Greek and European concepts of human
knowledge.

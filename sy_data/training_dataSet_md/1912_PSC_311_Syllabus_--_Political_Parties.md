## Course Description

This course investigates the roles of parties in historical and contemporary
political life in the United States. Its foci include:

  * the organizational structures of American party organizations and their development, 
  * the relationships between American political parties and the electorate, 
  * the relationships between Americal political parties and various institutions of government, 
  * nominations processes, and 
  * campaign finance. 
Additionally, we will on numerous occasions throughout the course discuss the
theory of partisan realignment. This theory posits American political history
as shaped by successive _party systems_ , or periods in which the structure of
political competition remains relatively stable. Punctuating these stable
periods are _realigning periods_ , or periods of shorter duration during which
political competition is less structured and coalitions more fluid.

Because this course presumes student familiarity with the processes and
institutions of American government and politics, all students should have
passed (or be untertaking concurrently) PSC 121 or an equivalent college-level
course at another institution. Political Science majors and minors who have
not already passed PSC 202, "Political Argument and Reasoning," should be
taking it concurrently this semester. PSC 202 is _not_ a prerequisite for
students who do not major or minor in Political Science. Students who do not
meet these prerequisites will find themselves disadvantaged.

## Books

Students shold purchase or otherwise obtain copies of the following books.
They have been ordered through the Orange Bookstore, and copies should be
available there.

  * Beck, Paul Allen. _Party Politics in America_. 8th ed. New York: Longman, 1996. 
  * Maisel, L. Sandy, ed. _The Parties Respond: Changes in American Parties and Campaigns_. 3d. ed. Boulder: Westview Press, 1998. 
  * Ferguson, Thomas. _Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Party Competition and the Logic of Money-Driven Political Systems_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1995. 
Additional readings may be distributed in class, on the web, and/or placed on
reserve in Bird Library.

## Course Requirements

The instructor expects each student to come to class prepared to discuss the
materials assigned for that session. Class sessions will be held in two
formats. Sometimes, the instructor will lecture. At other times, the
instructor will moderate student discussions of the reading materials.
Lectures will not simply review the reading material. They will present
material not included in the readings, but related to them. Students who read
the materials but do not come to class and students who come to class but do
not read the materials should not expect to receive a passing grade.

Students are expected to participate in class discussions. The instructor will
of course recognize students who wish to speak, but he will also occasionally
call on students randomly for their comments. The best way for students to
ensure that they will be able to comment when called upon is to come to class
prepared. The instructor will note when students are unable to comment on the
materials or are unavailable to comment.

Students will write three examinations, on the dates listed in the Course
Schedule below. All exams will be cumulative, but all will focus upon the
materials most recently assigned. _The lowest of the three examination scores
will not be used in calculating final grades._ Scores on the two remaining
examinations will be weighted equally. Because the lowest examination score
will be dropped, the instructor will provide _no makeup examinations_.
Students who do not appear for an examination will receive a zero. Since this
will likely be the lowest grade, it will not be used in calculating the final
grade. Students will also prepare term papers on some facet of American
political parties. The appropriate length of a term paper is of course a
function of the ideas conveyed (not to mention the font size, font
proportionality, the margin widths). A tight, short paper is preferred over a
long, rambling mess. As a rough indicator, term papers under five pages in
length are _probably_ unacceptable. Conceivably (but improbably) a very short
paper might be so cogent that its shortness can be overlooked.

On the dates listed in the Course Schedule, students will submit written
progress reports on their research for their term papers. The first report
will identify the thesis of the paper and describe the evidence that will be
marshalled in its support. The second report will refine the thesis, list the
full citations of sources consulted thus far, and report on any problems
encountered in gathering evidence. Citations to sources, in both the term
paper and the research reports, should employ the citation format used in the
_American Political Science Review_ , copies of which are available in the
Periodical Room and in the stacks of Bird Library.

## Grading Criteria

Final grades for this course will be assigned on the following basis.

  * Examinations (50%). 
  * Research Progress Reports (10%) 
  * Term paper (30%). 
  * Attendance and participation (10%).

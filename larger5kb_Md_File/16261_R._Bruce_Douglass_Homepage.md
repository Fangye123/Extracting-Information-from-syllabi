_GOVT 468 Department Seminar: After Liberalism_ (Syllabus)  
Ever since the publication of John Rawl's A Theory of Justice in 1973,
liberalism has enjoyed a great renaissance as a moral and political
philosophy. But that same renaissance has also given rise to sustained
criticism from any number of different points of view. For every important
book or article that has appeared defending the adequacy of liberal ideas as a
basis for conducting the public life of democratic societies in our time there
has been another challenging claim. Some of the most interesting of this
criticism has come, in turn, from authors who choose to characterize their
work as post-liberal. These are people who obviously are sympathetic to much
of what contemporary liberal thinking represents and yet as the same time are
convinced ultimately it is not adequate. So they seek to go beyond what
liberals have achieved in a direction that speaks to the concerns reflected in
their critique. This seminar will examine some of the better work being done
in this vein, drawn from the writings of such figures as Michael Walzer,
Martha Nussbaum, Charles Taylor, and Philip Selznick.

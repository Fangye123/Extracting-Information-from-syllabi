HIST 321 Syllabus:
[http://www.msubillings.edu/history/HIST321S99.htm](http://www.msubillings.edu/history/)

**COURSE OBJECTIVE**  
The primary objective of this course is that through the study of History,
students may nurture within themselves the knowledge of the historical context
of this nation as a means of understanding the country within which they live.
Also, through this introduction to the discipline of History, students will
gain skills valuable in a broad-based liberal arts education.

**COURSE PURPOSE**  
This course is a general survey of United States history, from the end of
Reconstruction to the present.  The primary emphasis in this course will be on
understanding the political, social, and cultural developments in United
States history as this country faced new conditions following the dawn of the
industrial age and its entrance onto the world stage as a leading power.

**REQUIRED READING** (available in the bookstore)  
Cary, et al, The Social Fabric Vol. II (8th edition) (New York: Longman, 1999)

**TEACHING APPROACH AND COURSE REQUIREMENTS**  
This course will be an intensive examination of the results of the effort of
the American people to "reconstruct" the nation in a new image after the Civil
War.  The results of that reconstruction combined understandings of the ideal
of freedom for all with new pressuresoexpansion, industrialization,
urbanization.  By the turn of the century, the United States faced new
pressures as an imperial power.  The course will end with an examination of
the emergence of the US as a leading world power in the context of the world
wars, and the ways in which that leading position was challenged by the rise
of the Communist bloc in the post-war years.  In order to make this rapid
coverage of this material as effective and useful as possible, it is vital
that students do all of the assigned reading.

In the course of the term, we will have two exams and a series of three
reaction essays (2-3 pages each), in addition to occasional quizzes.  The
exams will be taken in class, during regularly scheduled class meeting times.
They will consist of IDis, in which the student will identify key individuals/
events/theories and state their historical significance; and essays.  We will
discuss effective essay-writing strategies more as exams near.  Quizzes will
consist of a handful of multiple choice questions in addition to short
answers.

The reaction essays will be on the studentis reactions to the readings
assigned from the Social Fabric  volume.  Reactions will be 2-3 pages each,
and may reflect issues raised in the questions at the end of each chapter.
All essays will be in essay form, with introductions, paragraphs in which the
body of the essay is developed, and a conclusion.  We will write one essay
every other week, on chapters assigned for that week, for a total of three
essays for the course of the term.  Thus, the essay from week one must be
based upon the studentis choice of chapters 1-5.  Essays will be handed in on
Thursday, and handed back the following Monday.

**Exam and Review Due Dates:**  
Midterm Exam:  Wednesday, June 30  
Final Exam:   Friday, July 16

**NOTE:   COMPLETION OF ALL ASSIGNMENTS IS NECESSARY TO PASS THIS COURSE.**

**POLICIES IN EFFECT FOR THE DURATION OF THE SEMESTER**  
Office Hours:  
This session, I will be teaching a class from 9:00-12:00, Monday through
Friday.  Therefore, I will be unavailable for office hours immediately after
this class.  I will be available, however, after that for a while, or you can
more easily contact me via email at either of the addresses above
(mreding@msu-b.edu OR redinger@wtp.net) all day, every day.  I check my mail
at both addresses several times per day, and will be happy to address your
concerns then and there.  Of course, if any student needs to meet with me at a
mutually agreeable time, I will be happy to make such arrangements.

Attendance:  
There is a clear correlation between regular and punctual attendance in class
and academic success.  In recognition of this correlation, all students will
be expected and required to attend all lectures and examinations.
Particularly in a summer term, attendance is vital, since we will cover a
significant amount of material in each class meeting.  Poor attendance will
adversely affect the final grade; the final grade will be penalized by half a
grade for every two unexcused absences.

Grade Percentages:  
Quizzes:   15% (total)  
Reaction Essays:  25% (total)  
"Midterm" Exams:  30%  
Final Exam:   35%

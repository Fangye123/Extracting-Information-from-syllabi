Course Description

**Welcome to Planetarium Operations!** (We call it _Planet Ops_ for short.)
The primary aim of Planetarium Operations is to offer you an introduction to
the various technical systems of the OBU Planetarium and to make you at home
in the night time sky.

  * Planetarium Operations is not an astronomy course, nor is it equivalent even to just the laboratory portion of an astronomy course. In the planetarium you will catch the romance of astronomy, as you become familiar with the constellations, the stories of the skies, and some of the astronomical jewels to be observed among the stars. In this way Planet Ops can make an ideal supplement to formal courses of study in astronomy ([GNSC 250 Earth Sciences](../../earth/index.htm), [US 311 Natural Sciences](../../us/311/index.htm), or a Topics in Astronomy Education course by arrangement).  

  * Nor is Planetarium Operations a tutorial course where everyone engages in unlimited hands-on experience with one-to-one instruction guaranteeing mastery of multimedia technologies in fifteen easy steps! Working in small groups as much as possible, you will gain an initial familiarity with the technical systems so that they will not intimidate you, which may whet your appetite for more. Our class numbers and time span will limit what we can achieve on Monday nights, although the planetarium is accessible to you for hands-on practice throughout the week on an optional basis. We only scratch the surface of the technical systems in a one-credit-hour course! It is my hope that Planet Ops will prepare you for future hands-on experience in the planetarium as a student worker, if you are interested in pursuing planetarium projects after the second semester. 

So what kind of course is Planetarium Operations? Planet Ops is a special
laboratory course in which students get a behind the scenes glimpse into the
operation of the planetarium and begin to participate in its ongoing activity,
all the while having the opportunity to get to know the night sky. Planet Ops
offers nonintimidating hands-on experience in astronomy, educational
principles and multi-media technologies, as well as fine arts and
communication skills, and may be of lasting benefit to a variety of students.
Students of all majors are welcome to take this course, and your various
interests and diverse talents will all contribute to the instructional
resources of the OBU planetarium.

* * *

## **Materials**

No additional materials are required for second-semester Planet Ops students.
First-semester students will find the following supplies in the
[bookstore](../general/store.htm):

** **

  * **Chet Raymo. _365 Starry Nights._** Raymo will help you become familiar with the night sky, to get to know some interesting skylore and learn some basic astronomy. This text provides the kind of content that would be conveyed in a **[Starstruck Tonight](../shows/starstruck.htm)** planetarium show, organized seasonally. 



  * [Planisphere](../bcp/instruments/planisphere/planisphere.htm)



  * You will need to make a **[red-light flashlight](../bcp/instruments/redlight.htm)** and a **[star clock](../bcp/instruments/starclock/clock.htm)**. Bring these with you to every Astronomy Hour. 

** **

  * **Planetarium Operations Manual**. Supplied via pages on the world-wide web, which you can print as needed. Store your notes and printouts in a three ring binder to keep them integrated and properly sorted. 

* * *

## Meeting Times

Planet Ops meets Monday nights in the planetarium (Rm 108):

  * **Basic Training Hour, 7 to 8 pm.**  
Training in basic operation of planetarium systems (required of first-semester
students only).

** **

  * **Astronomy Hour, 8 to 9 pm.**  
Training in basic observational astronomy. Required of both first and second-
semester students.

** **

  * **Advanced Training Hour, 9 to 10 pm.**  
Training in telescopic astronomy and advanced planetarium systems (second-
semester students only).

## Course Requirements

** **

  1. **FIRST SEMESTER:**  
Students enrolled in the Planetarium Operations course for the first time will
focus on the following priorities:  ** **

    * **Night Sky Orientation**  
Becoming familiar with the constellations and how the sky moves, to the degree
necessary for presenting a seasonal sky tour.

      1. Use Raymo outdoors at least once each week as your tourguide to the real night sky. Get together and observe in small groups! 
      2. At midsemester all students will present a five-minute [constellation presentation](presentations.htm) to fellow students that involves at least one motion of the star projector. 
      3. At the end of the semester, students will work together in several teams to produce semester projects, usually consisting of constellation presentations involving multimedia effects. 

** **

    * **Basic Training in Planetarium Systems**  
Introductory training in the various technologies involved in operating the
planetarium, including the star projector, slide projection systems, special
effects, automation and programming, photography, video and audio systems, and
educational media.

** **

  2. **SECOND SEMESTER:**  
Students enrolled in the Planetarium Operations course for the second time
will focus on the following priorities:  ** **

    * **Night Sky Observation**  
Becoming more familiar with the constellations and the basic operation of a
telescope.

      1. Continue to use Raymo outdoors at least once each week as your tourguide to the real night sky. 
      2. In the early part of the semester all second-semester students will present two five-minute [constellation presentations](presentations.htm) to fellow students. 
      3. Twice during the semester, second-semester students will host a telescopic star party for first-semester students. 
      4. At the end of the semester, students will present individual or small group semester projects, usually consisting of constellation presentations involving multimedia effects. 

** **

    * **Advanced Training in Planetarium Systems**  
Advanced training in the various technologies involved in operating the
planetarium, as indicated in the tentative course schedule.



  3. Both first and second-semester students will **assist** in the presentation of at least **one evening of Planetarium shows** (ordinarily on a Friday night). See [guidelines for assisting with shows](../workers/assist.htm). Students have the option of learning to present various types of shows, and some of the semester projects may be scheduled for a public show, if desired. 



  4. Both first and second-semester students should obtain an email account and email your address to me at [Sheila_Strawn@mail.okbu.edu](mailto:Sheila_Strawn@mail.okbu.edu). Please check your email roughly weekly. 
    * Optional: Subscribe to an astronomy or planetarium related [electronic magazine or listserve](../links/mags.htm), such as Dome-L. 

** **

  5. **Program Production** (Optional) 
    * Students may help set-up and produce the planetarium's ongoing or pending shows. This production may require script writing, lesson-planning, multi-media preparation, creation of slides and special effects, computer programming, preparation of educational materials, photography, computer graphics, audio production, electronic and equipment set-up, etc. A second semester student might elect to design a project involving one or more of these tasks. 
    * Whenever a show is presented, students will receive full credit for their work by having their names projected on the dome. All programs will require intensive student activity to complete their production.

## **Assessment**

** **

  1. **FIRST-SEMESTER STUDENTS:**

** ** **Worksheets, 40%**      Each Basic Training Hour will be structured
around activity worksheets that guide students as they explore the technical
systems as much as possible in a hands-on manner (often in small groups).
Worksheets will be checked at the end of each training period. (The systems
are more thoroughly explained in the technical pages of the Planetarium
website. Students may print assigned pages beforehand for reference but are
not expected to study them in full.)

** ** **Skywatch journals, 20%**      Ten skywatch journals are required per
semester. Turn them in one at a time as you complete them during the course.
The weekly skywatch journal may take either of two forms:

    1. A record of one evening's skywatch in the outdoors under the real sky, on the basis of Raymo: 
      * Record the date, time, and location at the top of the page. 
      * Read the section in Raymo's _365 Starry Nights_ for the current date. Try to spot whatever Raymo mentions in the text. Record what you look for and indicate whether you see it. 
      * List 5 constellations that are visible which you can identify, and never repeat the same set of 5. Try to identify at least one new constellation each week. 
        * First week suggestion: Practice using the Big dipper as a skymark to find your way around. Print the [Big Dipper web page](../bcp/aster/general/dipper.htm) and use it as your first skywatch journal. 
        * [When are constellations visible?](../bcp/aster/general/when.htm) This page indexes them month by month throughout the year. 
      * Record the [phase of the Moon](../bcp/zodiacal/moon/phases/lunarcycle.htm) if it is visible, and its location in the sky. 
      * Record any visible planets and their location by constellation. A current planet chart is always posted on a planetarium bulletin board, or use the [What's Up?](../links/calendars.htm) web page. 
      * Any other phenomena? Shooting stars, Milky Way, auroras (if you're lucky!), etc. 
      * Will you vary your star-gazing times, or will you carry them out at the same time of night (or morning)? 
      * Optional: Use binoculars, if you have them, to examine the surface of the Moon, a nebula, the Andromeda galaxy, or some other deep sky object. 
    2. Cloudy-weather "indoor skywatch": 
      * Browse the [constellation pages](../bcp/aster/constellations/index.htm) of the Basic Celestial Phenomena website. Choose a constellation and print the page for reference. 
      * Check to make sure all web-links are accurate (if any don't work, please indicate them on the printed copy). 
      * Read the indicated pages in Raymo that describe the constellation. 
      * Are there any additional features of this constellation, its deep-sky objects, or its skylore, that need to be added to the web page? If so, please write suggested revisions on the printed copy. 
      * Are there NASA descriptions and photos of deep sky objects for this constellation we might add links to? If so, indicate the address for these links on the printed copy. 
      * If the weather is clear and the constellation is visible from our latitude, please attempt to view the constellation and note the date and time you attempted to spot it. 
      * Turn in the annotated printed copy as a substitute for the outdoor skywatch. 

** ** **Constellation Presentation, 20%**      One constellation
[presentation](presentations.htm) will be required of all first-semester
students about midway through the semester, given in the Planetarium during
the Astronomy Hour.

** ** **Semester Project, 20%**      See course requirements, above, for a
description of semester projects. Further ideas are suggested below.

** **

  2. **SECOND-SEMESTER STUDENTS:**

** ** **Worksheets, 20%**      Each Advanced Training Hour will be structured
around activity worksheets that guide students as they work with advanced
features of the technical systems in a hands-on manner (often in pairs or
small groups). The systems are more thoroughly explained in the technical
pages of the Planetarium website. Students should print assigned pages
beforehand for reference but are not expected to study them in full.
Worksheets will be checked at the end of each training period.

** ** **Constellation Presentations, 20%**      Two constellation
presentations will be required in the planetarium during the Astronomy Hour.

** ** **Skywatch journals, 20%**      Ten skywatch journals are required per
semester. Turn them in one at a time as you complete them during the course.
See description above.

** ** **Star Party Telescopic Presentations, 20%**      Two telescopic
presentations will be required at the star parties hosted for the first-
semester students.

** ** **Semester Project, 20%**      See course requirements, above, for a
description of semester projects.

** ** **Contracts:**      For students with special interests and clear goals,
alternative custom formats are available for the second semester. Talk with me
before the end of the second week of the semester if you are interested in
taking the course on a contract basis. Most contracts will involve a semester
project of some type, approved in advance. Contracts can be written to
concentrate exclusively on the project; for instance: developing proficiency
with some of the technical systems (without participation in the Astronomy
Hour); logging a certain number of telescopic observation hours (without
participation in the Advanced Training Hour); or creating and producing a
particular show or project in the planetarium, etc. Talk with me: the sky is
the limit in **your** planetarium!

** **

  3. **NOTE WELL:**  
    * Erratic attendence may result in a failing grade. 



    * How to fail this course suddenly:  
Extreme violations of [Planetarium Procedures](procedures.htm) can result, at
the Director's discretion, in expulsion from and/or a failing grade in the
course.



    * Disabilities  
Any student in this class who has a disability should contact Bobby Canty in
the Student Services Center, GC 101, as soon as possible to discuss possible
accommodations.  

* * *

## **Ideas for Semester Projects**

Semester projects may be constellation presentations, enhanced by automated or
manually-cued multimedia effects, or they may be more ambitious. Possible
projects may be quite diverse, touching on many areas of interest:

  * General Skywatching; e.g., a particular constellation & its associated mythology 
  * Astronomy; e.g., the life cycle of stars 
  * Planetary sciences; e.g., Jupiter Collisions and Geological Catastrophism 
  * History of Astronomy; e.g., Kepler's Cosmic Harmonies 
  * Mathematics; e.g., analemmas, conic sections, calendars, etc. 
  * Education; e.g., What's in the Sky? (for preschool and elementary children) 
  * Cultural interest; e.g., Space Travel 
  * Music; e.g., Gustav Holst, modern "space music," etc. 
  * Fine Arts; e.g., Vincent Van Gogh (set to "Starry Night" by McClean) 
  * Special interest; e.g., Medicine Wheels, Star of Bethlehem, etc. 
  * Philosophical or Theological; e.g., Science Fiction and Cosmic Visions 

* * *

## Demand & Appeal of Course

The production of planetarium shows offers valuable experience to a wide
variety of students, including those majoring in Telecommunication, Fine Arts,
Graphic Arts, Music and Music Education. Education majors or pre-ministerial
students may be attracted by opportunities for gaining pedagogical experience
in live presentations (as well as experience dealing with educational media
such as slide projectors). Students majoring in Language and Literature can
express their talents through script-writing. Those with an interest in
electronics or computers will find their technical skills much needed in
production. Students who want to develop an amateur interest in astronomy will
discover in this course a unique opportunity to become familiar with the
nighttime sky (either prior to or supplementing US 320 Earth Sciences and US
311 Natural Sciences).

* * *

## Necessity of Course for Planetarium Activity

A typical staff for a planetarium of our size and capabilities would number at
least 4 full-time professionals with specialized training reflected in titles
such as Director, Program Producer, Technical Engineer, Photographer,
Musician, Director of Education, etc. The faculty staffing for the OBU
Planetarium is one half-time Director-Professor. Through the Planetarium
Operations course, the planetarium will gradually develop a corps of trained
student workers to assist the Director in all aspects of program production
and show presentation. Graduates of the course will be preferentially hired by
the Planetarium on a work-study basis.

* * *

## Current Projects of the OBU Planetarium

  * [Cosmology and Cultures](../shows/cosmology.htm) Project 
    * Egyptian cosmology 
    * Babylonian astronomy (see Christmas show, below). 
    * Islamic cosmology 
    * Medieval cosmology (see Dante's universe, below). 
    * Flat Earth show. 
    * **Cosmic Visions**. This show, one of many in the Cosmology and Cultures series, will explore some of the interconnections between cosmologies and world-views, including heliocentrism and the vastness of space, plurality of worlds, the search for extra-terrestrial life, Big Bangs and Big Crunches, "Many Worlds" quantum theories, Black Holes and singularities, etc.  

  * **The Magi and the Messiah's Star**.  
Commercial shows are largely inadequate for this topic, being historically
inaccurate, theologically unsound, and religiously insensitive or antipathic.
Our own in-house production might feature the faith of Johannes Kepler, who
also wrote a treatise on the star of Bethlehem. Kepler's explanation of the
Star of Bethlehem remains one of the most viable possibilities, but others
would be mentioned as well, and evaluated both astronomically and historically
in the context of recent studies of Babylonian astronomy circa 300 to 1 B.C.
By integrating the gospel story with accounts of the magi and of Kepler, we
might offer a Christmas program that would more faithfully reflect the joy and
meaning of the season.  

  * **Starstruck Tonight**
    * Especially needs work on soundtrack production. 
    * Modules change seasonally. 
    * Needs more visuals.  

  * Fine arts: 
    * Theater performance? 
    * Music performance and/or recording? Bison Hill Arts festival? 
    * Concert under the Stars?  

  * **Follow the Drinking Gourd**. 
    * In connection with actual stories of African-Americans fleeing slavery along the Underground Railroad, this show explores the circumpolar constellations such as the Big Dipper (the "Drinking Gourd") and simple techniques of celestial navigation. If designed in an appropriate modular fashion, it could be adapted for elementary, university, and general audiences. 
    * Upper elementary; for February, Black History Month? 
    * Needs much adaptation; soundtrack needs redoing.  

  * **More than Meets the Eye**. 
    * Designed for use in conjunction with holding public telescopic skywatches. 
    * A multi-media planetarium show from Loch Ness Productions. 



  * Stars of our Neighborhood; Constellation Stories (with puppets or actors).  
For preschoolers, with stuffed constellation animals or puppets and fun songs.  

  * Promotionals. 
    * A Day in the Life of Bison Hill (a 10-minute university tour). 
    * A Day in the Life of the Wood Sciences Building (a 10-minute recruitment show). 
    * The Universe from OBU (a 5-minute intermission show touring the planetarium).

**Course Description:**

In this course we study a number of key figures, intellectual debates, and
major literary movements (Romanticism, Realism, Modernism) of Western
modernity through the close analysis of a number of important texts. The
course emphasizes the profound breaks with the old-European tradition
experienced and enacted by modern intellectuals and artists. We utilize a
sociological approach to intellectual history in order to advance our insights
into key patterns of development of modern European intellectual and artistic
life. Class time will be divided between lectures and discussions, with an
emphasis on critical reading and interpretation.

**Course Requirements:**

Students are expected to be well prepared for the class meetings, i.e., to
have studied the assigned readings carefully, and to participate actively in
the class discussions. There will be take-home
[midterm](coursenotes/midterm.bls354.aut01.html) and
[final](coursenotes/final354A01.html) exams (30% each), which are designed to
reward class preparation and participation. Students are also asked to write a
[3-page argumentative essay](coursenotes/paperbls354aut01.html) (40%), dealing
with an assigned topic on one of the three novels.

**The Emergence of Consumer Culture**  
  
This course has three goals. The first is to examine the market revolution
that transformed an agrarian, producer-oriented society and sped the growth of
a modern consumer culture whose citizens purchased what their predecessors
were more likely to make for themselves: food, clothing, even entertainment.
The market's rapid expansion in the late 19th and early 20th centuries brought
important structural changes to American business and commerce, yet it had an
equally dramatic impact on how Americans conducted their daily lives and
imagined their future happiness. No longer, as Thorstein Veblen suggested by
the title of his turn-of-the-century critique, The Theory of the Leisure
Class, could Americans be expected to buy simply what they  "needed." Rather,
their "needs" now required a theoretical explanation that took into account
the mass market's complicated relationship to class, gender, and other social
dynamics. In studying the meaning of consumer culture, we will likewise
consider theoretical prespectives and, in doing so, accomplish another goal of
the class. This second goal is to address the interdisciplinary nature of
American Studies, that is, to discuss the methods and questions that
distinguish this field of study from single, disciplinary approaches to
American civiliation. In this respect, the question of "culture"\--what it is,
how it works, and what it means for American Studies--is crucial, and one
which we will turn to throughout the term. The third and final objective of
the class is to familiarize you with the basic research skills necessary for
doing a senior thesis or essay in this major. Thus, the seminar will be
something of a workshop in how American Civilization is "made."  
  
  
**Requirements  
**  
Periodical Survey: a 7-pg. analysis of a 19th or 20th century periodical. Due
Wednesday, October 20 in Adirondack House (worth roughly 25% of your grade).  
  
Oral Report: to be given in class on a critical essay or primary text (in the
syllabus the choices are *ed) which is not part of the required reading. Your
job is to summarize your findings, relate it to the primary readings, and
spark discussion. Your performance will be evaluated along with your general
class participation.  
  
A Group Syllabus and Presentation: based on a collaborative investigation of
the field of consumer culture. With 2 or 3 of your classmates you will
assemble an annotated reading list and a sequence of assignments that focus
more specifically (than this syllabus does) on a selected topic in consumer
cultural history (you might, for instance, concentrate on 20th-century
advertising). You will then present your syllabus to the class, along with 2
reading assignments (a secondary reading and a primary text), and conduct a 50
minute class session. Presentations will take place during the second half of
November. (25%)  
  
Take-Home Final: a 8-pg. essay on an assigned question requiring you to draw
on all the work you did during the term. Due Monday, December 20. (30%)  
  
Class Participation: is especially important in this kind of class (and will
count toward approximately 20% of your final grade). Attendance at all class
meetings is required.

## **SOCIOLOGY AND THE INTERNET**

###  Robert E. Wood  
Department of Sociology, Anthropology and Criminal Justice  
Spring Semester 2000

**_The explosive growth of the internet has provided sociologists with new
tools for carrying out sociological research and with a new subject for
sociological investigation. This course is designed both to increase student
skills in using the resources of the internet to do sociology and also to
explore the emerging field of the sociology of cyberspace._**

![rutgers_redline.gif \(273 bytes\)](rutgers_redline.gif)

**Course Description.** This course will combine classroom and computer lab
sessions. Attendance at all classes and labs is important; do not take this
course if you are unable to attend daily. Assignments include six exercises
designed to develop internet skills; an electronic communication requirement
designed to explore different types of computer-mediated communication; a
research paper on how a social group is using the internet to bring about
social change; and two quizzes on lecture and reading materials. _Students
will be expected to spend at least three hours on the internet each week
outside of class, working on the assignments and the research paper, and
exploring the internet._ If you do not have internet access from home, it is
incumbent on you to schedule adequate time in the [computer
labs](http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/RUCS-Camden/hours.html) on campus.

Most of the readings in this course are available online, and can be accessed
simply by clicking on the titles (hypertext links) on the online syllabus.
They then may be read online (this is recommended for those with hypertext
links built in); downloaded onto a disk or onto the hard drive of your
personal computer; or printed out directly.  _Assigned readings are not to be
printed out in BSB 117 during class lab time._   **_Browsing_ sites** should
be explored online _before_ the class for which they are assigned. Several
_**recommended** _**sites** call up radio shows on the internet from PBS radio
__ archives (these require the RealPlayer plugin).

**Requirements.**   The **[Electronic Communication
Requirement](445communication.htm)** involves the use of email, listserves,
WebCT bulletin boards and WebCT chat rooms.   We will use all of these types
of computer-mediated communication to conduct the business of this course, and
we will analyze the pros and cons of each.

[**Internet exercises**](445exercises.htm) designed to increase your web
skills include:

The **[Internet and Social Change Research Project](445res.html)** will
involve exploring and analyzing how the internet is being used by a specific
group of people to bring about some form of social change. You will be asked
to explore the degree to which a _virtual community_ can be said to exist for
the group you have chosen and the degree to which the group is successfully
using the internet to take collective action to bring about social change. The
papers must be prepared in HTML format, ready for uploading onto the class
website.

**Course grades** will be determined as follows: Electronic Communication
Requirement (10%); Exercises (45%); Virtual Community Research Paper (25%);
Quizzes (10%) and class attendance and participation (10%; no more than 2
absences and regular participation showing preparedness).   Inadequate class
attendance and/or inadequate participation in class discussions (both online
and offline) will result in a grade penalty. Students may earn up to five
extra credit points by presenting their research findings at the joint
Sociology-Psychology poster session on Friday, April 28th.

All students are expected to participate in the class bulletin boards and chat
rooms as specified in various class assignments.  These portions of the course
are located on the New Brunswick WebCT server and require students to set up a
username and password.  Keep a record of yours handy!  I will be available
after class (11:00-12:00 and in the afternoon, 3:00-4:00) to discuss course
issues and to provide computer assistance for those who need it. Occasional
online office hours in one of the course's chat rooms will also be scheduled.
I encourage you to raise general issues on the class listserv and bulletin
board; more specific questions may be addressed to me via email at
[wood@crab.rutgers.edu](mailto:wood@crab.rutgers.edu)

The course portal is located at [http://camden-

All students should check the [Instructor's Notice Board](445notice.htm)
regularly for updated assignments and other course-related news.

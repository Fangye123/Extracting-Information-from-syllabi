> _Course Description_

>

> In this course explore Africa south of the Sahara from the perspective of
social and cultural anthropology. Students will gain an understanding of the
richness and variety of African life as well as information that will increase
their appreciation of Africa's current politics, problems, and prospects.
Readings have been selected to expose students to a diverse sampling of
African society and culture.

>

> _Texts_ :

>

> Grinker and Steiner, eds. _Perspectives on Africa_  
>

> _Requirements_ : Students are responsible for information in both lectures
and readings. Students should be aware that they are responsible for material
in the readings even though this material may not be directly discussed in
class.

>

> _Exams_ : There will be three exams. The first exam will be short answer and
multiple choice questions, the second exam will be a take-home essay, and the
final will be entirely multiple choice.  The final will be cumulative but will
emphasize material covered since the second exam.  and the final will consist
of short answer, multiple choice and true/false questions. You MUST arrive at
exams on time and with proper tools (bubble sheets, blue books, pencils, etc).
In general, approximately 80% of the exam questions will come from lecture,
20% from reading.

>

> _Attendance_ : Attendance is required and will be calculated on the
following scale:

>

> 0-1 absences = 2 points added to your final class grade.  
>  2-3 absences = no penalty  
>  4-6 absences = 1 point subtracted from your final class grade.  
>  7-9 absences = 5 points subtracted from your final class grade  
>  10-12 absences = 10 points subtracted from your final class grade  
>  more than 12 absences = a final grade of F

>

> _African Films_ : We are fortunate to have several feature length films by
African film makers available. At least four of these will be shown during the
semester. Show dates times and locations will be announced in class. You are
not required to attend these films but you will receive five points extra
credit added to your first exam grade for each film you do attend.

>

> _Students with special needs_ :  Students with special needs (as documented
by the Office of Disability Services) should identify themselves at the
beginning of the term.  The Department of Anthropology is dedicated to
providing these students with necessary academic adjustments and auxiliary
aids to facilitate their participation and performance in the classroom.

one week of its scheduled date. If you have a problem with exam dates, let me

two weeks after your grades are returned. If you wish to see your exam you

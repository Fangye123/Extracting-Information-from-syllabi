reading this, presumably you're already there.  
**Course Newsgroup:** uca.bio.bio4415  
**Prerequisites:** Biology 1440, 1441 (Principles of Biology I-II) and 2490
(Genetics)  
  
**Text:** Freeman, S. and Herron, J. C. 2000. _Evolutionary Analysis._ Second
edition. Prentice-Hall, New Jersey. (Possibly optional. I will make references
throughout the course to suggested readings, case studies, algebra problems,
etc. in the textbook. However, all of the material that I will test you on
will come from my lectures-the book is there primarily as backup). Selected
readings from the primary and secondary scientific literature will be given
out as needed during the course. These will be discussed in certain lab
meetings.

**UNIVERSITY POLICIES**

You are encouraged to familiarize yourselves thoroughly with all policies
listed in the Student Handbook, including but not limited to:  

**Sexual harassment policy:** Sexual harassment by any faculty member, staff
member, or student is a violation of both law and university policy and will
not be tolerated at the University of Central Arkansas.  Sexual harassment of
employees is prohibited under Section 703 of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and sexual harassment of students may constitute discrimination under
Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. More information is available
beginning on page 93 of the 2000-2001 Student Handbook, with which you are
encouraged to familiarize yourselves thoroughly.

**Disabled students:** The University of Central Arkansas adheres to the
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you need an
accommodation under this Act due to a disability, contact the UCA Office of
Disability Services at 450-3135. More information is available beginning on
page 26 of the 2000-2001 Student Handbook, with which you are encouraged to
familiarize yourselves thoroughly.  

**Statement on academic misconduct:** The University defines academic
misconduct as follows:

  1. In connection with the taking of, or in contemplation of the taking of any examination, any student who (a) knowingly discovers or attempts to discover the contents of an examination before the contents are revealed by the instructor; (b) obtains, uses, attempts to obtain or use any material or device dishonestly; or (c) supplies or attempts to supply to any other person any material or device dishonestly; or (d) during the course of an examination obtains or attempts to obtain unauthorized information from another student or from another student's test materials. 
  2. Any misrepresentation of academic work by a student as the product of their own study and efforts.   

  3. The unauthorized possession, taking, or copying of solutions manuals or computerized solutions for homework or research problems assigned by a professor and/or instructor. 
In the event an instructor determines that a student has engaged in academic
misconduct, the instructor will meet with the student and inform him/her of
the action or sanction the instructor deems appropriate. More information is
available beginning on page 26 of the 2000-2001 Student Handbook, with which
you are encouraged to familiarize yourselves thoroughly.

**COURSE POLICIES**

**Attendance:** Attendance will not be taken after the first few meetings. You
are presumed to be adults, responsible for the consequences of your own
actions, and able to cope with the dire results of missing even the slightest
fraction of this course. You cannot make up missed labs or exams in this
course, but if you miss a lab or exam because of a medical or personal
emergency, your grade will be prorated. Such an absence must be documented, if
at all possible, by a note or other documentation from your doctor, dentist,
car mechanic, arresting officer, parole board, etc. as the case may be.

**Additional Readings:** An important part of this course is the introduction
to the primary and secondary scientific literature on evolutionary biology. In
eight of the lab meetings, we will set aside one hour for discussing articles
from major journals or extracts from books. These will be provided to you at
least one week in advance, and part of your grade will depend on how well you
understand and can discuss them. Each one of these discussion sections will
count twenty-five points towards your final grade, so it is to your advantage
to participate fully, and to do the assigned reading carefully and well in
advance.  

**Exams:** There will be two midterm exams (100 pts. each) and a final exam
(200 pts.) The midterms will not be cumulative. The final exam will be
cumulative, but will focus mostly on material from the second half of the
course. Exam format will include mostly fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and
short essay questions. Cheating, if caught, will result in an automatic F for
the course. The textbook readings are intended to reinforce and clarify the
lecture material-but lectures will be the primary source for everything on the
exams.  

**Labs:** Yes, we do labs in this course! Handouts for each lab will be
provided to you several days in advance, together with instructions for
completing the accompanying lab write-up that you will turn in for a grade.
Each of these will be worth twenty points, for a total of 300 points.
**NOTE:** One of the labs involves an all-day field trip, to be taken on
Saturday, November 11. This is _not_ optional.  

**Term paper:** All students are required to write a term paper on some aspect
of evolutionary biology. The paper must be at least 2000 words long and
include a bibliography of at least ten **printed** references (books and
journals). More details on how to write and format this paper will be given at
a later time.

The paper can be about almost anything covered or touched on in the course, or
in your reading, but the topic **must** be approved by me beforehand. To that
end, you will turn in a one-paragraph statement of the topic on September 22,
and a more detailed and extensive outline on October 24. The topic and outline
will not be graded, but failure to turn either one in will count 20 points
against your term paper grade. The purpose of both is for me to check and
approve your topic, and offer advice, suggestions, sources of information, and
general encouragement. Neither the topic statement nor the outline should be
considered set in stone-if you decide to change topics later on, you may do so
if you check with me first.  

**Internet Resources:** I use both the World Wide Web (WWW) and a Usenet
discussion group in this course. The course WWW page is **http://faculty.
uca.edu/~benw/biol4415/** Electronic versions of most of the course handouts
will be available here, including this syllabus, practice problems,
instructions for term papers and lab reports, and so on. Web versions of the
PowerPoint electronic slide presentations that I use will also be here; this
will enable you to review my slides at your own pace, as often as you like.
The Usenet newsgroup, **uca.bio.bio4415** , is a forum for discussions, and I
will make certain resources available on it as well; more information about
newsgroups and how to access them will be forthcoming.

**GRADING** Midterm exam 1 100 pts.  
Midterm exam 2 100 pts.  
Final exam 200 pts.  
Labs 300 pts.  
Term paper 100 pts.  
Discussions 200 pts.  
**TOTAL: 1000 pts.**

No extra credit or bonus points will be given. Don't ask.

Letter grades will be assigned as follows:  
1000-900 pts. (90-100%) A  
899-800 pts. (80-89.9%) B  
799-700 pts. (70-79.9%) C  
699-600 pts. (60-69.9%) D  
599-0 pts. (0-59.9%) F  

I reserve the right to curve grades upwards if the uncurved grades would, in
my estimation, be too harsh (e.g. if the highest grade in the class is 544
points despite the fact that everyone has worked hard and learned much). I
also reserve the right to adjust a student's letter grade upwards if his or
her numerical score is within a few points of a grade cutoff. I will not
necessarily do this for everyone who potentially qualifies. Grades will not be
curved downward. If everyone in the class earns  >950 points, everyone will
get an A, and a grade of 80.1%, for example, will not be curved down from a B
to a C (although a grade of 79.9% **could** get curved up from a C to a B).

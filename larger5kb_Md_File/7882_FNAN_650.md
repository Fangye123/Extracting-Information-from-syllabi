**Cases:**

Six cases, including the final exam case, will be assigned during the
semester. Each student must submit a written report on each of the cases.
These reports should be concise and similar in style and content to a report
intended for a firm's senior management. The case analyses must be typed or
computer printed. You may elect to form a team of two or three students and
jointly conduct the analysis and prepare the case write-up. With a team
submission, all members of the team will receive the same grade on the case.
The team must assume the responsibility for assuring that the case write up is
turned in on time. There will be a one-letter grade penalty day following the
due dates for cases turned in late.

  
_For additional information on the use of cases in this course, please see the
class handout_ **The Use of Cases in FNAN 650** _prepared by the instructor._  
  
**Grading:** Each of the six cases will have an equal weight in determining a
student's final end of semester average for the assignment of final grades.  
**Spreadsheet Capabilities:**

Most financial management problems of any complexity are more easily resolved
using a spreadsheet program. If you are not familiar with the use of a current
spreadsheet program, you need to quickly pick up some capability in this area.
If you are using a recent version of Excel, you will want to make sure the
additional financial functions that are part of the Analysis ToolPak have been
loaded. You use the _add ins_ command from the _tools_ header bar to start
this process.

**Use of Cases in FNAN 650**  
  
I believe that students gain a better understanding of financial management
models and their assumptions by working through a series of case assignments
than focusing on preparing for and taking exams in financial management. Of
even greater importance is the feedback I have received from our students that
they have retained much more of what they learned about financial management
from resolving case problems than other experiences in this course.  
  
**Telecommunications Industry**  
  
The six written graded case assignments during this semester all are placed in
the telecommunications industry. I have selected the telecommunications
industry for several reasons. First, it is a very large and increasing dynamic
industry that does provide for a number of different types of financial
management problems. Second, by focusing on a single industry it is easier for
students to apply what they have learned in an earlier case to a subsequent
case without having to pick up some of the basics about another industry.
Third, at least for some students, this introduction to the telecommunications
industry has been helpful to them in gaining employment in the industry.  
  
**Topics and Learning Objectives**  
  
I have participated in developing all of the cases and organized them to
follow the course as it progresses with specific learning objectives for each
case. The topic and the primary objectives for each case follows:  
  
1\. Dividend Expectations  
a. Role of past payments by the firm  
b. Adjustments for stock dividends or stock splits  
c. Industry and market influences  
c. Impact upon growth and firm value  
  
2\. Estimation of a Competitor's Opportunity Cost of Capital.  
a. Determination of yields and tax effects on the cost of debt  
b. Determination of cost of equity capital including sources of market
information  
d. Importance of market values versus book values  
  
3\. Valuation of the Implied Option Feature within a Convertible Bond  
a. Use of the options pricing models in corporate finance  
b. Estimation of variables required for options models  
  
4\. Bond Refunding  
a. Resolution of unequal size problem in capital budgeting  
b. Approaches for different lives (maturities)  
c. Valuation of multiple alternatives  
  
5\. Lease Investment Analysis  
a. Analysis of Cash flow timing  
b. Forecasting future commercial paper yields  
c. Price determination for transfer pricing  
d. Project cost of capital determination

University, Fairfax, Virginia, July,1997._  
  
  
  
  
6\. International Lease Investment  
a. Analysis of cash flow timing  
i. Foreign exchange transactions  
ii. International taxation effects  
b. Forecasting future foreign exchange rates  
  
**Operational Level of Cases**  
  
In developing these cases I have tried to focus on problems of the type I
expect MBA graduates in a finance function will deal with. These cases are not
intended to represent strategic decisions made by the board of directors of a
firm, but to provide students exposure to some of the complex financial
problems they might be asked to help resolve within several years of having
completed their degree. I am available to consult with you regarding an issue
you may have about a case. My goal is for you to learn about financial
management and its assumptions in dealing with these cases and thus my
"consulting" sometimes is a series of questions back to you directed at
getting you to the point where you have a sense of how to answer the question
yourself.  
  
**Grading**  
  
I do read and grade all of the cases myself. Grades range from an A+ on
extraordinary cases to an F on those cases that are totally off base. Grading
of cases is somewhat subjective and there is an element of competition in the
assigning of grades. A technically correct solution that is poorly presented
almost always receives a lower grade than a well presented correct solution.
Just submitting a technically correct solution does not automatically mean an
"A". While this is not a course in technical report writing, I do believe that
effective presentation of one's work is vital if you expect to add value.

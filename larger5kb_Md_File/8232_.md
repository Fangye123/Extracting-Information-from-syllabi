COMMENTS: RELIGION is a LISTSERV list for the scholarly discussion of
religions. It is sponsored by the Harvard Center for the Study of World
Religions. Unlike lists with similar names, RELIGION does not deal with
matters of personal faith or theology. Rather, it's aim is to encourage
discussion of the historical and comparative study and teaching of religions.
Relevant approaches include history, sociology, psychology, philosophy,
literary criticism, and anthropology. Relevant issues include methodology in
the study and teaching of religions; comparative themes such as myth, ritual,
mysticism, community, and inter-religious contact; and issues specific to
particular traditions. Some of the materials available from the listserv:
Queen, Christopher. Syllabus from the seminar, Buddhism in America. (1992).
Available from RELIGION listserv BUDDAMER SYLLABUS. Sperling, Elliot. Syllabus
from the seminar, Tibetan Religions. (1993). Available from RELIGION listserv

Mongolian Buddhism, Bengali Sufism, and Tangut Manicheaism off the initial

DATE OF CREATION: October 1987 COMMENTS: The Tibet Information Network (TIN)
is an independent, non-profit making organisation which collects and analyses
information about the situation in Tibet. It works to help protect fundamental
human rights in Tibet by fostering the flow of information from Tibet about
current conditions in that country. The organisation began when a group of
western tourists witnessed the shooting by Chinese police of a number of
Tibetan demonstrators in Lhasa in October, 1987. The authorities denied that
police had opened fire, expelled journalists and tourists, shut down telephone
lines and impounded foreigners' photographs of the incident. As a result, a
number of tourists came together to compile detailed accounts of what they had
seen and to send these to the outside world. Later some of those who had
witnessed similar incidents formed TIN in order to continue the collection of
accurate and dispassionate information about the situation inside Tibet. TIN,
now based in London, UK, continues to conduct research into conditions in
Tibet. It monitors developments in the political and economic fields as well
as matters relating to the environment, the education and health services,
religion and the arts in Tibet. Particular attention is paid to issues that
relate to the observance or otherwise of human rights. Information comes from
researchers in the field, as well as from official Chinese and Tibetan sources
which are monitored in London. Observations from foreign visitors and overseas
press reports are also assessed. Interviews, documents and secondary sources
are processed by a team of volunteer translators and editors, and a selection
of information is published in regular News Updates. Urgent news reports are
distributed by fax and electronic mail to priority users. Detailed studies are
published as Special Reports; copies of original documents are also made
available, ecxept where the confidentiality of sources might be compromised.
TIN uses computer communications to transmit material quickly around the
world. It maintains an on-going public conference
(tibet.information/reg.tibet) on the APC computer network (including peacenet,
greennet, geonet, nicarao, pegasus, web, and igc) and has a special mail
service for usenet/bitnet users. Relevant materials are distributed to
subscribing organisations throughout the world including human rights
organisations, international agencies, governments, parliamentarians, and the
media. The collection and distribution of the information is guided by several
fundamental principles. TIN aims to provide accurate and objective
information, and to be free from political bias or affiliation. It therefore
maintains its independence from any other organisations as well as from
governments. TIN supplies information and research material to its subscribers
irrespective of their opinions and takes no part in campaigning or lobbying
activities. ENTRY UPDATED: 25 July 1994 # # # NAME: TIGER TEAM BUDDHIST

**REQUIRED TEXT**

_American Corrections, Fifth Edition_ , by Todd R. Clear and George F. Cole  
The text can be purchased at the bookstore.  

* * *

  
**COURSE OBJECTIVES**

The goals of this course are for students to:

1\. understand the variety of ways society punishes people who break criminal
laws

2\. become familiar with the philosophical underpinnings of correctional
systems and understand how correctional practices are   shaped by these
philosophies

3\. understand the benefits, drawbacks and competing considerations involved
in different policy choices

4\. think critically about our correctional practices and develop informed
ideas about how our justice system should respond to people who break the law

5\. improve their understanding of empirical research and its role in
measuring the impact of our policies

* * *

  
**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course examines the history, philosophy and components of the American
corrections system. It provides an overview of the origins of correctional
systems in the United States and abroad and an introduction to the
philosophical ideas with which specific correctional approaches are
associated. The history, nature and recent development of the major
institutions and programs that make up the correctional system \- jails,
probation, intermediate punishments, prisons and parole - will be explored.
Students will also learn about typical correctional clients, life in prison
and issues related to the management of correctional programs. Important and
controversial issues related to our contemporary correctional system, such as
the death penalty, the disproportionate incarceration rate of minorities and
the increases in imprisonment over the last two decades will be discussed.

**STUDENT EVALUATION**

Students' mastery of the readings and lecture materials presented in class
will be evaluated on the basis of their performance on two tests and a final
exam, a written assignment, and class participation.

**_Written assignment_**

Each student will find an article in an academic journal that evaluates a
correctional program and provide written answers to the following questions:

1\. What was the purpose of the study? What questions were the researchers
trying to answer?

2\. What kind of program was being evaluated (i.e. describe the program,
including a description of the people in the program - e.g. parolees, inmates,
men, women, etc.)?

3\. What method and measures did the researchers use to evaluate the program?

4\. What was their conclusion?

5\. What is your assessment of the study? Does it seem sound? Is there
anything you think should have been done differently?

6.  Assuming you had the power to do so, would you be willing to institute this program in your own jurisdiction on the basis of this evaluation alone?

Prior to the due date for the assignment, we will discuss an article that
evaluates a correctional program and do an exercise in class that will include
these questions. The paper you submit should be no more than four pages and
must be typed, double-spaced, with 1" margins all around. You must photocopy
and attach the article's abstract to your paper. Citations should follow the
style guidelines of the American Sociological Association or the American
Psychological Association. The department has a web page with [links to
sites](http://sociology.camden.rutgers.edu/curriculum/citation.htm) that
provide guidance on how to format written materials to comply with those
guidelines.

**PLEASE NOTE** : Unless your paper meets the following requirements, you will
receive no credit for this assignment and will not have a chance to resubmit
(so please see me if you are not sure how to do this assignment):

1\. The article __must be__ from a peer-reviewed academic journal ( _e.g.
Criminology_ , _Federal Probation_ , _Journal of Research in Crime and
Delinquency,_ or _Criminal Justice and Behavior_ ) not the popular press (
e.g. _Time_ , _U.S. News and World Report_ , _Newsweek_ or _Atlantic Monthly_
). My home page has a link to a partial [list of peer-reviewed
journals](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~jasiegel/journals.htm).

2\. **The article must describe empirical research evaluating a corrections
program.** An article in which the authors are reviewing past program
evaluations or are presenting their own beliefs or opinion about the
effectiveness of certain types of programs is not acceptable.

3\. The assignment must be written in your own words to the fullest extent
possible. If you must quote from the article, make sure that you provide the
appropriate citation.

4\. You must attach a copy of the article's abstract.

**_Class participation_**

Class participation is an important component of this course. Assigned
readings should be done **_prior_** to the date where they appear  on the
syllabus so that students are prepared to discuss the readings and answer
questions about them in class. In addition, questions may be posted
periodically to the class listserv (see below) that will require you to obtain
additional information from the Internet. Students should be prepared to
answer those questions orally in class.

Unexcused absences, repeatedly arriving late or being obviously unprepared for
class will result in a loss of points for class participation.

Student performance will be computed on the following basis:  
  Report on program evaluation |  15%  
---|---  
Test 1 |  20%  
Test 2 |  20%  
Final  |  35%  
Class participation  |  10%  
  
Make-up exams will be given **_only_ if you have obtained my permission to be
excused from the actual exam _prior to_ the time of that exam**. Late
submission of written assignments will be permitted only with my **prior**
consent, or permitted with a penalty, depending on the reason for lateness.

* * *

  
**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

The college's academic integrity policy, which can be found in the college
catalogue, will be enforced in this class. Students are also encouraged to
refer to the department's [web site on
plagiarism](http://sociology.camden.rutgers.edu/curriculum/plagiarism.htm),
which includes links to an on-line version of the university's academic
integrity policy and some useful links to other sites that may help you avoid
plagiarizing inadvertently. If you are in doubt about what might constitute
plagiarism in a written or oral assignment, please check with me.

* * *

  
**LISTSERV**

A listserv has been established for this class. I will use it when needed to
communicate messages to the entire class, which each student will receive as
an e-mail message. Students can also utilize the listserv to pose questions or
comments to the entire class. Instructions on subscribing to the listserv can
be found by [clicking
here](http://crab.rutgers.edu/~jasiegel/listservs02.htm).

**READINGS**

The schedule outlined below represents my _intended_ timetable, but
adjustments may be made during the semester.

Students are responsible for knowing the material in the readings, regardless
of whether it is discussed in class or not. In other words, your tests will
include materials from class lectures and your readings, unless otherwise
noted. Since I will not be able to discuss all of the subjects covered in the
text, **you should take careful notes on the readings and ask me about any
topics you do not understand and that I have not reviewed in class.**

>  Office: Sewall Hall 42C  
>  Office Hours: T, Th, 1:00-3:00, F 1:00-3:00 p.m.

>

> **Course Description:** This course is a survey of American culture and
society from Reconstruction to the present. We will examine how
industrialization, urbanization, and the emergence of the United States as a
world power shaped modern America. The lives of European Americans, American
Indians, African Americans, Asian Americans, and Chicanos and Latinos were
transformed by the emergence of modern industrial America. Shaped by the
meeting of diverse peoples and cultures, the United States is becoming a
multinational society in a global industrial civilization.

>

> **Course Objective:** The larger goal of this course is to teach you how to
critically analyze, evaluate, and judge competing perspectives on American
history, culture, and  
>  society. If you disagree with an argument or perspective, or find it biased
or limited, then say so. If you find the reading difficult, confused, or
pointless, then say so. But, in each case, you must be prepared to support
your argument and larger conclusions.

>

> **Required Reading:**

>

> Gerster, Patrick and Nicholas Cords, eds., Myth America, vol. 2  
>  Hoffman, Elizabeth and Jon Gjerde, eds., Major Probems in  
>  American History, vol. 2  
>  Hymowitz, Carol and M Weissman, A History of Women in America  
>  Loewen, James, Lies My Teacher Told Me

>

> **Class Format:** Interactive lectures and class discussions. We will use
the course readings to study how American culture and society is shaped by a
series of individual and societal choices. History is not a story of automatic
progress and development, but the result of individual and collective
decisions to take one course instead of another. Make sure you read the
assigned readings before each class. When you do the readings, always try to
place them in their historical context and to gather evidence and examples to
strengthen your essays and reaction papers.

>

> **Attendance** : I will take class attendance at the beginning of every
class.  
>  Attendance is very important for success in college classes. If you don't
attend class it is hard to keep up with the reading and class material.

>

>  
>  **Quizzes and daily assignments** : To make sure students are keeping up
with the reading, I will give pop quizzes on the daily reading. Quizzes will
be based on a general knowledge of the readings: What are the larger
conclusions or observations made in the reading. In addition to quizzes, I
will give short daily assignments based on the daily reading. For example, you
may be asked to outline the larger argument of an essay.

>

> **Grading:** Grades will be based on quizzes and daily assignments (15 %),
class participation and attendance (15 %), two short reaction papers to the
readings (20%), a take-home midterm (20%), and a take-home final (30%). I
reserve the right to give unannounced quizzes and assignments in class.
Content will count most heavily in all written work, but grammar, spelling,
and style will also affect your grade.

>

> Course grades will be defined in these terms:

>

> A-Excellent -- (Thoughtful, coherent, insightful, contributes)

>

> B-Good -- (Knows material well, lacks depth, not outstanding)

>

> C-Fair -- (Adequate, average, passing, little participation)

>

> D-Poor -- (Little understanding, little effort, incoherent)

>

> F-Fail -- (No evidence of understanding, no work, no learning)

>

> **Reaction papers:** (2-3 typed pages) From the list of possible reaction
paper topics, choose two to write on. You can earn extra credit if you write
more than two reaction papers. (5 percent total extra credit for each
additional reaction paper.) You are required to write at least one reaction
paper before the midterm is due (Oct. 28). Before the reaction paper is
officially due, you can turn in rough drafts for my review. As long as you
turned in reaction papers when they were due, you can revise and rewrite them
for a higher grade throughout the rest of the semester.

>

> **Exams** : Exams will be made up of long and short answer essay questions
covering lectures, class discussion, and reading assignments. Your essays will
be graded on how well you use historical arguments and examples from class
discussion and the reading to support your thesis. Instead of memorizing the
material, concentrate on learning how to use historical arguments and examples
to address major themes in American culture and society. If you keep up with
the reading and take good class notes, you should have no trouble with the
exams.

>

> **Incompletes:** I will be very reluctant to give a grade of Incomplete (I).
I assign incompletes only to students who have successfully completed most of
the course work and who have been prevented by significant and unanticipated
circumstances from finishing all of their assignments.

>

>  
>  **University Honor Code:** As citizens of an academic community of trust,
CU-Boulder students do not lie or cheat whether they are on campus or acting
as representatives of the  
>  University of Colorado in the surrounding communities. Neither should they
suffer by the dishonest acts of others.

>

> The University of Colorado has adopted a Student Honor Code. See the website
at:  
>  http://www.colorado.edu/policies/honor.html. The University of Colorado has
also  
>  adopted a code of student behavior for classrooms. See the website at:
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/classbehavior.html. Students are responsible
to honor the Student Honor Code and Classroom Behavior Code. Please go to
these two websites to read these codes and to understand the Student Honor
Code at CU-Boulder.

>

> As faculty, students, and members of the University community, we value
honor, integrity, and morality. Honor is about academic integrity, moral and
ethical conduct, and pride of membership in a community that values academic
achievement and individual responsibility. Cultivating honor lays the
foundation for lifelong integrity, developing in each of us the courage and
insight to make difficult choices and accept responsibility for actions and
their consequences, even at personal cost.

>

> **Students with Disabilities:** I encourage students with disabilities,
including non-visible disabilities such as chronic diseases, learning
disabilities, head injury, attention deficit/hyperactive disorder, and
psychiatric disabilities, to discuss with me after class or during my office
hours appropriate accommodations. If you have any additional questions about
how the University can accommodate your disability, please see me or the
Coordinator of Disability Services in the Disability Services Office, 322
Willard Hall, (303-492-8671). If you qualify for accommodations because of a
disability, please submit to me a letter from Disability Services early in the
semester so that your needs may be addressed. Disability Services determines
accommodations based on documented disabilities (303-492-8671, Willard 322).
See the Disability Services website: www.colorado.edu/sacs/disabilityservices.

>

> **Religious Obligations and Class Attendance** : If you have conflicts with
scheduled exams, assignments, or other required attendance, because of
religious obligations, please notify me two weeks in advance of the conflict
to request special accommodation. See the CU Policy at this website:
http://www.colorado.edu/policies/fac_relig.html  
>  
>  **Cheating and Plagiarism** : My policy on cheating and plagiarism is to
assign a zero to the work in question. Plagiarism is copying another person's
work and turning it in as your own. Plagiarism can involve buying a "class
paper" online, copying another student's work, or copying whole paragraphs and
material from other sources, such as encyclopedias or textbooks. See the
website for the Pledge not to Plagiarize:
http://www.colorado.edu/academics/honorcode/Code.html.

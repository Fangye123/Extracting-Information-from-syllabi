I. Seminar description


This seminar examines qualitative methods used in social science research,
focusing primarily on participant-observation, on asking questions, on
writing fieldnotes, and on the transformation of these primary field data
into written ethnographic documents.  Other methods considered include the
quantification of ethnographic data through the use of computer programs,
decision tree modeling, and time allocation studies.  Seminar readings on
specific research methods will contribute to the formulation of a research
project to be carried out during the semester.  Recent literature on the
theoretical and ethical aspects of these methods will also be considered
in the context of these projects.

II. Seminar requirements



Participation in the discussion of class readings is an important part of
the seminar.  Students will be responsible for the assigned readings, for
taking part in class discussions, and for presenting an oral summary of
their research project. (25%)


An 8-10 page mid-term paper that integrates a discussion of class readings
with research project preliminaries such as research question formulation,
site and informant selection, methodology, interview questions, and human
research impact statements is due on 13 March 1997. (20%)


A paper based on this research project, 20-25 pages (double-spaced, not
including references, tables, etc.), will be due on 13 May 97.  Topics are
open but projects might focus on local constructions of ethnic or
religious identity, on interpretations of recent welfare changes by
particular groups, or on the life histories of particular individuals
associated with an aspect of social change in the community.  A meeting
for discussion and approval of the research project topic should be made
by the 3rd week of class and a human subjects impact statement along with
a project summary and tentative interview questionnaire are due by the 4th
week. (35%)


A research notebook should be kept during the course of the semester with
bi-weekly entries about your research project, both as you are formulating
it (which can include comments on the readings, seminar remarks, etc.) and
as you are conducting research (as a field notebook).  This would include
notes taken during field interviews, transcribed interviews, data
interpretations and analyses, and other relevent materials (20%)  


(*) Books are available at the University Store and on reserve, along with
journal articles, at the Woodrow Wilson School library.

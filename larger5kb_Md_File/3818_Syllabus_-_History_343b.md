**Black Paris: Art and Ideology in a Modern[ist] Diaspora **

  
This course is a reading and discussion seminar, incorporating a significant
research component. Conceptualizing black expatriation as a type of
"performance," we will consider the lives and work of [selected] African
American musicians, artists, and writers in Paris in their framing cultural
contexts--local and global.

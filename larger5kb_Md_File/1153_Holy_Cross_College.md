10.   _MAKE-UP POLICY_

            Exams are taken on the day assigned.  In the event that a student misses an exam, the student will arrange to take an oral exam.

            Each of the map projects must be submitted when collected on the date assigned on the syllabus. **Anything submitted after the class period is considered late**. One class period late will result in half credit.   Two class periods  late will result in no credit.

            Reflection Papers are due at the beginning of class on the date the reading is due.  **Anything submitted after the class period is considered late and will result in no credit**. 



11.   _SUGGESTED STUDY SKILL_

            Students are expected to read the assigned material before each class.  Time should also be spent reviewing the material covered in the previous class.  Quizzes will be based on both reading for the day and the lecture notes from the previous class.



12.   _ATTENDANCE POLICY/ WITHDRAWAL POLICY_

            Attendance and class participation are essential for success in this class.  I adhere to the Holy Cross College attendance policy as published in the 2001-2002 Student Handbook (page 4-5).  When a student reaches the maximum number of absences, a grade reduction may occur or a student may be issued a grade of FA.     When missing a class,  the student is expected to e-mail the instructor on the day of the absence,  stating the reason for the absence.  I also adhere to the withdrawal policy as published in the 2001-2002 Student Handbook (pages 12-13).

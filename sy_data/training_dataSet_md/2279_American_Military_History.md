**American Military History, 1607-1914**

![Ist Minnesota Statue, Gettysburg](1minna.JPG)

**Courage, ideology or both?** This statue commemorates the charge of the
First Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment at Gettysburg on the second day of
the battle. Ordered to plug a breach in the Union line, the regiment began the
charge with 262 men. It contained the Confederate advance and helped save the
Union position on Cemetery Ridge, but at a cost of 215 killed and wounded: a
percentage loss of 82 percent. This is generally considered to be the highest
percentage of casualties suffered by any Union regiment in a single battle
during the entire Civil War.

Even Newer:  Lecture Notes for Rest of Course

> Thanks to our foray into the world of the Peace Camp, we're about four
lectures behind schedule.  So that we can concentrate on the course's most
important themes and avoid a forced march through the remaining three weeks, I
have placed an old (but serviceable) set of lecture notes on the web.  These
should supplement the material in _For the Common Defense_.   Needless to say,
they are not a replacement for coming to class.

**Overview and Objectives**

This course describes and analyzes the history of American military policy
from the colonial period to the eve of the First World War. It focuses on the
creation of American military institutions, the genesis of policy-making and
maintenance of civilian control over that process, the interrelationship
between foreign and military policy, the conduct of war, and the influence of
American society upon the armed forces as social institutions.

Students will achieve an understanding of the main developments in American
military history, the ways in which these developments reflected or shaped
developments in general American history, and the main interpretations
advanced by scholars who have studied this subject. They will also hone their
skills at critical writing and analysis, and will gain greater insight into
the way historians explore the human condition.

**Texts**

Allan R. Millett and Peter Maslowski, _For the Common Defense: A Military
History of the United States of America._ , Revised and Expanded Edition.
(Abbreviated in the syllabus as FTCD.)

Fred Anderson, _A People's Army: Massachusetts Soldiers and Society in the
Seven Years' War_.

**How To Survive History 582.01  
A Guide for Undergraduates**

#### Introduction

History 668.01 describes and analyzes the history of American military policy
from the colonial period to the eve of the First World War. It focuses on the
creation of American military institutions, the genesis of policy-making and
maintenance of civilian control over that process, the inter-relationship
between foreign and military policy, the conduct of war, and the influence of
American society upon the armed forces as social institutions. It is an upper
division course intended to be taught at the graduate student level. It is
also an elective; I therefore assume that students have chosen to take it
because they are interested and motivated to learn the material.

The course requires about 100 pages of reading per week--sometimes more,
seldom less. If you accept this reality at the outset you will be all right.
If you assume you can pick up everything from lecture or from a light skimming
of the main text you will not do well. It's as simple as that. But don't
assume that you can blow off the lectures, either. For one thing, paying
attention to the lectures will help keep you on track, so that you don't
overemphasize some issues while ignoring others. For another, good attendance
helps generate a certain goodwill between instructor and student, because it
more or less demonstrates that the student is trying. That goodwill can come
in handy if you fall down on the mid-term and need a little extra help.
Finally, there is almost always a strong positive correlation between good
attendance and good course performance. So while lecture attendance is not
required, it is strongly encouraged.

#### Office Hours

Similarly, I encourage you to take full advantage of my office hours and those
of the teaching associate. As a practical matter, you may want to visit him in
preference to myself, since he will be grading your examinations.

#### Examinations

The mid-terms and final are divided into two main parts: "identifications" and
essays.

**1\. Identifications**

Identification questions call upon the student to identify and give the
significance of a given term. The identification portion of the answer should
define the term and/or discuss its important features. The significance
portion should link the term to one or more of the larger conceptual issues
raised in the course. Example:

_Alfred Thayer Mahan_ \- professor at the U.S. Naval War College, prophet of
seapower and author (among many other works) of The Influence of Seapower Upon
History. Mahan's work laid stress on command of the seas as a key to national
power and emphasized the creation of strong battle fleets as the means by
which this might be achieved. Denigrated commerce-raiding and stressed the
destruction of the enemy's main battle fleet as the most appropriate
objective. Significance: Mahan was the foremost proponent of the ideas that
underlay the creation of steam-powered, big gun steel navy in the late 19th
and early 20th centuries, and a major example of the new military
professionalization that occurred during this period.

Notice that this ID was answered in just four sentences. Try to be as succinct
when you write your own. Too often students will include a great deal of
extraneous information in their ID responses that improves their grade not a
whit. Just as often they will fail to address the ID's significance; i.e., to
place it in a larger context. Avoid making either mistake.

**2\. Essay**

The identification portion of the test is concerned primarily with the
student's understanding of the facts. By contrast, the essay is more concerned
with the student's grasp of the overarching concepts and how these concepts
organize and give meaning to the facts themselves. Students frequently assume
that the essay is just another way for them to demonstrate what they know
about the material that has been presented in class. This leads them to do a
"memory dump," which can have unpleasant consequences and usually does,
because an essay is intended to test your ability to think analytically and to
explain your analysis on paper. This involves, in turn:

a. an ability to write clearly, so that the reader is not baffled by
misspellings, grammatical faults, run-on sentences, etc.;

b. an ability to articulate a thesis; in other words, to orient the reader to
the question that will be answered and to explain why the question is
important;

c. an ability to prioritize. What issues are most important in answering the
question? What is the most logical order in which to present them? What
examples most clearly illustrate these critical issues?

d. an ability to avoid the irrelevant: everything you write should relate
directly and explicitly to the question posed;

e. an ability to write an essay that is proportional to the time allowed for
its completion. If you have 20 minutes to complete an essay, you must tailor
your depth of coverage so that you cover the whole question in 20 minutes,
without omitting important points or overemphasizing one point to the
detriment of another.

Note: The exams will test you on the three additional books assigned in the
course. For the midterm, you'll be tested on Fred Anderson's _A People's Army_
; for the final, James M. McPherson's _For Cause and Comrades_ and Theodore
Roosevelt's _The Rough Riders._

#### Book Reviews

**1\. Selection of Books**

You must choose _two_ books from the bibliography in the back of this packet,
_but you cannot_ choose books that are already part of the reading for the
course. The books should be related in some way--chronologically,
thematically, etc.--and you should examine the books in a comparative fashion.

**2\. Content**

I expect your book reviews to conform more closely to those found in scholarly
journals than to those in newspapers and general interest magazines. In
newspapers and magazines, the main point of the review--besides telling what
the book is about--is often to give the reader a sense of the work's style and
dramatic qualities. Academic reviews, on the other hand, have a somewhat
different agenda. Their purpose is fourfold: (1) to explain briefly what the
book is about, (2) to analyze its thesis, (3) to offer a critical assessment
of the book's strengths and weaknesses, and (4) to appraise its historical
value. While this is not intended as a rigid formula, each of these points
should be addressed in the course of your review.

1\. What the Books Are About - Offer the reader a brief overview of the books'
subject matter, but try to encapsulize each work within three or four
paragraphs. Identify the major events and personalities examined, key concepts
employed, etc., but do not summarize the books in detail.

2\. Thesis - What are the authors' main arguments? What are they trying to
demonstrate or refute? Do they reach similar or divergent conclusions?

3\. Strengths and Weaknesses - What do you think of the authors' theses? Do
they do a good job of proving it? What sources did they use--personal
experience, unpublished government documents, private manuscript collections,
published primary or secondary works? If the books deal extensively with non-
English-speaking nations, did they consult sources written in the appropriate
foreign languages? Do you think they addressed all the relevant issues or can
you think of some that they ought to have examined but did not? What were the
authors' qualifications for writing such books? Did they have a particular ax
to grind? Is their writing style clear or is their prose convoluted and
difficult to follow?

4\. Historical Importance - How useful would an interested historian find the
books to be? What makes you think so? Most especially, place the books within
the context of one or more of the main themes and concepts discussed in the
course.

These questions and issues are intended as examples of what your paper should
cover. They are not a checklist. Some may be more relevant to the books you
select than others while you may come up with other questions not mentioned
here.

**3\. Format**

Your review should be typed, double-spaced, and about eight pages in length.
It should be written clearly and free of grammatical errors and misspellings.
I AM NOT KIDDING.

On a separate cover sheet, give the review some sort of title and below it,
place your name, the course number, and the date. The book's bibliographical
data should appear at the top of the review: author, title, place of
publication, publisher, date of publication, number of pages. For example:

Christopher Duffy, _The Military Experience in the Age of Reason_. New York:
Atheneum, 1988. Pp. xi, 446.

In instances where you quote directly from the works under review, a
parenthetical citation [e.g., (Duffy, 242)] is appropriate. If other works are
quoted, give the full citation in a footnote [e.g., Christopher Duffy, _The
Military Experience in the Age of Reason_ (New York: Atheneum, 1988), 242.]
When in doubt, consult an appropriate reference work. One of the best is Kate
L. Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_
(5th ed., Chicago and London: University of Chicago Press, 1987). It sells for
about $7.95 in paperback and is readily available.

In the past, I have received a number of book reviews that do not meet the
above criteria, with dire consequences for the student.

**Possible Book Review Pairings**

The list below offers just some of the many possibilities for comparative book
reviews. For other books, see the extensive bibliographies at the end of
Chapters 1-9 of _For the Common Defense_. You are not limited to these
possibilities. However, the two books you suggest must offer equally good
opportunities for comparison, _and you must clear the books with me
beforehand_.

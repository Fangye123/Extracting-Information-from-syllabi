**_Course Objectives_** :

The goal of this course is for students to develop the following:

1.  A better understanding and appreciation of history and historical enquiry by means of an in-depth   
study of events in nineteenth-century Europe.

2.  An ability to think critically, analytically and systematically about complex historical events and   
issues.

3.  An ability to organize different types of source materials, relate them to each other by means of   
critical analysis, and use them to isolate essential themes and issues of
nineteenth-century European  
civilization.

4.  An appreciation of the variety of disciplines and approaches necessary to gain an understanding of   
the past.

5.  A sense of how nineteenth-century Europe relates to the broader development of modern   
Western civilization.

6.  A greater ability to express oneself clearly and concisely on paper, as well as an ability to   
articulate pertinent observations and questions orally.

7.  A general familiarity with the origins, course and significance of a crucial period in European   
history.

8.  A greater understanding of the human condition and experience by examining the dilemmas and   
challenges faced by men and women in societies experiencing rapid change.

   Return to Table of Contents

_Course Requirements_ : Two mid-term exams, a comprehensive final exam and a
research  
project/web page are the written requirements for this course. Failure to
complete any of the  
requirements will be regarded as a failure to complete the course, and will
result in a failing grade for  
the entire course (not a '0' for that particular assignment). In addition,
each student will  
prepare two written critiques, one of another student's initial document
analysis, the other of a  
student's web page. These critiques will not be graded, but failure to hand
them in on time will result  
in a loss of 7 points from the final grade in each case. All assignments
received in the seven days after  
the due dates indicated on the weekly schedule will be marked down up to one
full grade. Absolutely  
no assignments will be accepted after 5 p.m. on the seventh day.

Exams must be taken when scheduled. Make-up exams will be scheduled only by
prior consent of  
the instructor, and only for compelling reasons (as determined by the
instructor). If a student, without  
gaining prior consent, is unable to take an exam because of sudden illness or
some other  
extraordinary event, the instructor must be notified immediately. If I cannot
be reached directly or by  
phone, you must leave a message with the History Department. A doctor's note
or other written  
documentation must accompany a student's request for a make-up exam.

**Exams** : The first mid-term exam will contain short answer identifications.
The second exam will be a  
take-home exam consisting of two essays. The final exam will contain short
answer identifications and  
two essays, one of which will be comprehensive in nature. Class time will be
set aside before each  
exam as indicated on your weekly schedule, but the exams may contain other
material not covered in  
these sessions. The exams will be designed to test acquaintance with the
lectures and the assigned  
readings. Taking careful notes on the readings and in class, therefore, is
strongly recommended. The  
instructor will be looking for evidence of general knowledge, an organized and
analytical approach to  
that knowledge, and an ability to combine the raw materials of the course --
text, lectures,  
discussions, and documentary sources -- into pertinent and meaningful
insights. The instructor will  
also be evaluating your ability to communicate those insights. Points will be
taken off for run-on  
sentences, grammatical errors, spelling errors, poor punctuation, illegible
handwriting or any other  
problems that, in the opinion of the instructor, affect comprehension of the
student's work. Strive  
above all for clarity. The first mid-term will be fifty minutes long, the
final will be three hours.

**Research Project** : The research project for this course is to design a web
page centered on a  
particular primary source from the time period covered. In preparation for the
web page, students  
will complete two position papers.  They will then construct the web page, and
be given an  
opportunity to revise the web page before it is evaluated by me for grading
purposes. The details will  
be explained in class and in handouts. This will involve the preparation of an
initial document analysis,  
the construction of the web page, and the final revision of the web page
before it is evaluated by me  
for grading purposes. The details will be explained in class and in handouts.
This overall assignment  
will involve explaining the historical context of a document's formation,
analyzing the text of the  
document itself, determining the historical significance of the document's
content and ideas, and  
compiling an annotated bibliography of the best historical research on the
document and its  
significance. For research ideas, begin in all cases with the required texts
and sourcebook. All  
students should meet with me as early as possible about their choice, because
all the assignments  
must focus on the same document or set of documents. The first document
analysis will be distributed  
to other students in the class, each of whom will prepare a written critique
due as indicated in the  
weekly schedule. The latter assignment will not be graded, but failure to
complete it will result in a  
deduction of seven points from the final grade. Each student will also provide
a critique of a web  
page, subject to the same procedure. You will each have an opportunity to
revise your web pages  
accordingly, before I assign a final grade. The final grade will be for all of
these assignments as a  
whole. Because these assignments will be graded as a totality, the greatest
rewards will go to those  
who use each opportunity to improve on their previous efforts. The document
analyses and first  
critique must be printed on a word-processor in a standard 10 or 12 pitch font
(such as courier or  
times roman). They should be double-spaced, with a title page, and one-inch
(and no more than  
one-inch) margins. The text (not including bibliography and title page) of the
first document analysis  
each should be no less than 2 and no more than 4 full pages in length. The
second should be no less  
than 4 and no more than 5 full pages in length.  The content analysis portion
of your final web page  
must contain a minimum of five full pages of text (not including the text used
for links, targets or  
internal links, captions, sub-headings, bibliography, notes, or supplementary
material, like thumbnail  
biographies). This amounts to approximately 1250 words. If you import
biographical or other  
materials from other web sites or sources, you must indicate that the material
is derived from an  
outside source, and may not count  that as part of your own text for
fulfilling the minimal length  
requirements as indicated above. It is best, to avoid confusion, to leave such
materials in their original  
locations, and insert a link.  So, if you're doing a word count using Word,
you need to strip out all  
materials that are not part of the content analysis to get an accurate
reading.  Your name, the course  
name and number, and the date must be on the title page of all written
assignments. Each assignment  
must include a bibliography of all sources cited. Bibliography and endnote
citations must conform to  
the proper style for the liberal arts, as defined in the departmental style
sheet (http://web.lwc.edu/academic/las/history/HDPTSTS2.htm), or in the latest
edition of Kate Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses and
Dissertations_ , Chicago, 1987.  Do not use MLA, APA or any alternative style
current in other disciplines. Unless you wish to see the instructor fly into a
blind rage, do not even think of using parenthetical notes on any assignment
other than the take-home. The web page critiques may be transmitted to me
electronically, or on disk, but must conform to standards of good presentation
(as determined by me), and be submitted by the due dates indicated.  The web
pages themselves should be turned in on a floppy or zip disk (no CDs), upon
which should be written your name, class, e-mail address, and the title of
your html file.

The type of material that must be documented (i.e. cited in endnotes)
includes: controversial or  
distinctive arguments and opinions, facts that are not a matter of broad
general knowledge, statistics,  
all quotes, and paraphrases or summaries of an author's argument. All direct
quotes over two lines in  
length must be indented and single-spaced as described in Turabian.

It is imperative that you document source material, but the argument or thesis
of your paper must be  
in your own words: excessive use of quotes or lengthy paraphrasing of sources
will not be accepted,  
and leads easily to the grievous sin of plagiarism. On plagiarism, see below.
The citation of at least six  
different sources is a minimal requirement for the paper. In addition to the
assigned texts, which you  
must use, you must utilize at least two other sources from the library, one of
which must be a primary  
source (in translation) from the period. While you may use encyclopedias or
other reference works  
for background information, these are not an acceptable substitute for a more
substantial outside  
source, and should never be cited in the notes or listed in the bibliography.
One of the remaining  
sources for your analysis must be an Internet source, appropriately cited and
linked on your web  
page. Use material only from reputable web sites (like universities). Never
use Internet sources the  
origins of which are murky or unknown to you. Double-dipping (submitting a
paper for this course  
that is substantially the same as a paper submitted for any other course, past
or present) is not  
permitted.

**_Class participation_** :  Class participation is an essential part of this
course. In most weeks, the last class period will be set aside for discussion
of the readings. Students must arrive prepared to discuss the weekly
assignments. In order to ensure this, I will designate at the beginning of
each discussion class two or more students who will be graded for their
contributions to the discussion that day. Any students so chosen who have not
read the material or who are absent without prior clearance from me will
receive a failing grade for that day's discussion. I will rotate the
selections so that everyone gets a more or less equal chance to be "on call".
Voluntary contributions from students not designated by this system will of
course be considered positively, especially when they demonstrate acquaintance
and engagement with the reading. Your overall grade for class participation
will not be figured numerically into your final score, but will weigh heavily
nonetheless. It will be used to decide borderline cases, offset negative
trends like absences, or, if judged to be of significantly higher or lower
quality than your written work, possibly bump you to a higher or lower grade.
If I judge this system to be producing inadequate results, I reserve the right
to require other written or oral assignments to facilitate discussion, and to
use these assignments in the determination of final grades. Knowing, as you
do, how sick and sadistic history professors are, it is in each and everyone's
direct interest to make the discussions work.

Return to Table of Contents

**_Grading_** :  The mid-term, the final, and the research project (the
document analysis and web page) are worth 100 points each. Your grade will be
determined by the total number of points you gain out of a maximum of 400. I
do not grade on a curve. Attendance, evidence of progress or lack thereof in
the course of the semester, and class participation, will be used to decide
half grades and borderline cases (which, experience shows, means most
students). Serious attendance problems or misconduct in class can result in a
lowering of grade. The grading scale is as follows:  
    
  _Score_                     _Grade_          388-400 | A+  
---|---  
         372-387 | A  
         360-371 | A-  
         348-359 | B+  
         332-347 | B  
         320-331 | B-  
         308-319 | C+  
         292-307 | C  
         280-291 | C-  
         268-279 | D+  
         252-267  | D  
         240-251 | D-  
         Below 240 | F  
  
_Extra-Credit Assignments_ : Extra-credit assignments may be arranged with the
instructor. These assignments must be approved in advance by the instructor on
or before October 19, and will not be accepted unless so approved. They are
worth a maximum of 40 points. Under no circumstances will an extra-credit
assignment be accepted as substitute for any other written requirement in the
course. An extra-credit assignment can only elevate a student into a higher
grade bracket (for example, from a B to an A) if the student has scored the
higher grade on at least one of the three major exams or as an overall grade
on the document analyses. The assignment must take the form either of an
analytical book review (not a book summary) 3-5 pages in length, or an
analytical research paper (with a thesis) 5-7 pages in length, and must
utilize sources not assigned in this course. The topic and sources must be
substantially different from any used in the document analyses. Style of text,
footnotes, bibliography and title page must conform to the guidelines of
Turabian. If you decide to do an extra-credit assignment, it must be turned in
no later than November 16 for you to receive credit.

**_Attendance Policy_** : Class attendance is a requirement of this course.
Repeated unexcused absences will lead to a reduction of grade. Unexcused
absences totaling 25% or more will result in an automatic F for the course.
The instructor will excuse a student only under the most extraordinary
circumstances. Chronic lateness will also be penalized, since it presents a
class disturbance. If a student arrives after roll is taken, it is the
student's responsibility to place his or her name on the class roll no later
than the end of that class period. Failure to do so will result in an
unexcused absence.

   Return to Table of Contents

**_Honor Code and Plagiarism_** : Students are expected to observe the honor
code. All work for this course must be pledged. Students found to have cheated
on an exam or to have plagiarized material in a paper will be subject to the
maximum penalty under college rules. For those in doubt about the definition
of plagiarism, it consists of copying passages from a source without both
attribution **and** quotation. If you have reproduced the language of your
source, you have committed plagiarism whether or not you have cited the source
and the page number. This includes passages that a student may have modified:
for example, changed verb tenses, omission or replacement of occasional words,
reshuffling of phrases, sentences or paragraphs, combining of different
plagiarized sources. Writing a bad paper in your own words is far better than
writing a good one using the words of someone else. One suggestion for
avoiding inadvertent echoing of your texts and sources: close all books when
writing, and consult them only for specific facts or direct quotes. Also,
proofread your paper with plagiarism specifically in mind. For more on
plagiarism, see the departmental style sheet.

_Tape-recording and Class Decorum_ : Tape-recording of lectures is not
permitted. Students who are excused from class by the instructor must make
arrangements with the instructor or with other students to cover the material
missed. Students who skip class without permission are responsible for making
their own arrangements with other students (not with the instructor) for the
material covered in class.

Students are expected to observe class decorum. Students engaging in behavior
bothersome to other students or to the instructor (for example, eating or
drinking, talking in class or the use of personal stereos) will be asked to
leave and marked as absent. Food and drinks are not permitted in the
classroom.

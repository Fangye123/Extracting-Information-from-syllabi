**Text: Mayer , Richard E. (1992). _Thinking, Problem Solving, Cognition._
(Second edition).** **    New York: Freeman. (M)**  Other readings will be
assigned.     The Bibliography contains much information surrounding the
topics of the course. The bibliography is presented for your benefit. It is
likely to be expanded during the year. Some of the required readings will be
drawn from this bibliography. Others are likely to be either generated by the
instructor or newly discovered sources found on the internet.  
**Course Description**

    This course will explore some of the principles underlying reasoning, problem solving, and associated topics in higher level cognition. We will also discuss some of the conceptual, personal and situational conditions that enhance or detract from clear thinking and performance. The course has two basic goals: 1) To give students theoretical and empirical information that extends and deepens their knowledge of the principles of Reasoning and Problem Solving in particular, and Cognitive Psychology in general.  2) To give students a set of analytic and conceptual tools which should be applicable to their own real life problems, actions, and decisions.

     Many of the topics of this course are currently very active research domains in cognitive psychology and cognitive science. There are many dimensions to their study. The approach that we take will be somewhat eclectic as we will look at these topics from various perspectives. Although the basic text (Mayer) seems to be better than any others that I have examined, it does not present a full view of the topics that will be covered. Some of these topics will be explored by readings, some of which are found at different URLs on the Internet. Others will be put on reserve, and will be accessible through BISON. In addition to assigning other readings, I will present, summarize, and have classroom discussions on ideas and concepts that I cannot find in a clear and concise form in the literature.

        Many of the ideas requires considerable reflection for understanding. Readings and class discussion are to be considered core components of the class. That is, students will be responsible for the material from these sources as well as from the assigned textbook. This Syllabus is accessible from my base class URL: **<http://pluto.fss.buffalo.edu/classes/psy/segal/>. ** As the course progresses I will attach links to the on-line syllabus to topic outlines and specific sources, hopefully, before they are discussed in class. Bringing a copy of these notes to class to help note taking is strongly recommended.

         The format of the class is primarily lecture and discussion. There will be new material presented in the class, but the class periods should also be thought of as opportunities to clarify the material and to put it into a more cogent and coherent framework. Since dialogue is an important source of understanding, I strongly recommend that you read the appropriate chapter in the text and any assignment prior to the class period and be prepared to discuss it. It is also of value for you to get together with some of your classmates to discuss some of the ideas that are covered in this course. There is simply not time enought in class for every issue to be fully explored.

        At times there may be specific short and focused homework assignments to be to be turned in and discussed in the following class period. Also I do not exclude giving short quizzes during regularly scheduled classes. If this can be done smoothly, it may become a regular part of the class. The class requirements include a short [term-paper of 5-8 pages](416termpaper.html), three midterms, and a final exam. Grades will be based primarily on the four exams (about 70%), the quizzes, and the written assignments (about 30%), although discussion may be considered. The exams will cover **both** reading assignments and class material.

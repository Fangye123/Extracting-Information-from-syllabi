### Course Objectives:

A goal of this course is to acquaint you with the diversity, as well as the
uniqueness, of gender relations in Latin America in the present day world. We
will explore the variable constructions of both masculinity and femininity,
and how these are enacted in everyday lives of ordinary people. The course is
divided into topic areas as opposed to geographic regions, and will require a
great deal of reading, and class participation.

#### Attendance & Makeups:

  
* There is no attendance policy. However, in order to participate in the class, it is necessary to be present. * When a student misses a scheduled exam for an excusable reason, the student will be allowed to take the exam as soon as can be arranged. Makeups on the final are not allowed. If a student misses the final, an incomplete will be assigned as the final grade. * It is the responsibility of the student to contact the instructor when exams etc., are missed and need to be made-up. 

#### Exams:

Two exams will be given, each worth 25 % of your final grade. The take-home
essay exams will be: *  
EXAM I: Oct. 23 *  
EXAM II: Dec. 6  
On the honor system, you will write your responses within a two hour time
period. I strongly encourage you to prepare an outline of your response first
so that you can complete the exam within the two hour time period. You are
encouraged to study with other students, however, the actual exam essays will
be written individually.

#### Assignments:

1\. You will be responsible for reading each week's readings. You will be
asked to write two to three questions for each assigned reading. At the
beginning of class, each of us will write our questions on the board, and we
will choose which ones to discuss. Each of you will be expected to partake in
each discussion session in a thoughtful and prepared manner, which includes
being prepared to sumarize each reading and discuss it. You will be evaluated
by myself and yourself as the semester progresses, each of our evaluations
contributing 50% to your assessment. This will count for 25% of your final
grade. 2\. Research paper, individually prepared, approximately 10-15 typed
pages (double-spaced, 1" margin, 10-12 point type.) In order to receive a
grade, which is worth 25% of final grade on the research paper, you must turn
in a topic, an abstract with summaries of the readings you will use, a draft
and final version. There will be opportunities to discuss in class how your
project is developing, and to exchange drafts of your paper with your peers as
well as myself. You will be asked to present your paper to the class in the
final week of the semester. You will evaluate your own paper. Your evaluation,
your culmulative steps in the preparation of the final paper will be
incorporated into my final evaluation of your paper. 3\. I expect everyone to
receive full to nearly full credit on participation and the assignments. You
will be asked to re-do your (final) research paper if it is not at least "B"
level work!

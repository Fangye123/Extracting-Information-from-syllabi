| ANTHROPOLOGY  
---  
  
**Program Overview**  
  
The department has a long-standing graduate program that trains students in
aspects of anthropology, focusing especially on Asia and the Pacific region.
The training emphasizes field research. In any given year there are students
engaged in such projects as excavating an ancient religious temple in Tahiti,
recording ritual life in rural Java, or analyzing the social system of a
Japanese factory. Specific faculty interests lie in Hawaii, Samoa, Tahiti,
Micronesia, China, the Philippines, Indonesia, Japan and Thailand.

![](royalty.jpg)Graduate studies in anthropology at the University of Hawaii
at Manoa are oriented toward training individuals to become well-rounded
scholars and teachers, as well as competent researchers and/or practitioners
in one or more sub-fields of Anthropology: Archaeology, Cultural Anthropology,
Discursive Practices and Physical Anthropology.

In Archaeology, the department has a major commitment to the study of ancient
Hawaii, the Pacific, and Southeast Asia. Each year the department offers
summer archaeology field schools in Hawaii, and occasionally elsewhere in the
Pacific (e.g. Fiji), that provide students with an opportunity to learn the
profession first hand. The archaeology program also participates in the fields
of Cultural Resource Management and Historic Preservation through courses and
placement of students in these developing careers.

**Cultural Anthropology** is the branch of the discipline concerned with the
study of contemporary peoples (ethnography) and the comparison of cultures,
which aims at arriving at general understandings of the human condition
(ethnology). Cultural anthropologists in the department have done research in
China, Japan, Southeast Asia and Oceania. No orthodoxy defines the department
and students are encouraged to develop their own theoretical specializations.

**Discursive Practices** deal with the processes by which cultural meanings
are produced and understood. This approach offers a distinctive perspective on
linguistic anthropology as well as cultural anthropology as a whole. It
subsumes, but extends well beyond, the traditional field of linguistic
anthropology and is central to contemporary cultural anthropology, especially
its concern with ethnographic methods. The key objective of a discursive
practice approach is to develop theories and techniques relevant to the
analysis of meaningful behavior in actual situations. Discursively oriented
anthropology emphasizes linguistic, semantic, and interactional aspects of
culture as well as extra-linguistic discourse modalities. It treats the full
range of social forms and practices in terms of how they are discursively
produced and understood.

**Physical Anthropology** is the study of the human condition from a
biological perspective. It includes the study of human evolution from its
early pre-hominid beginnings; the study of physical variations in
contemporary, historic, and prehistoric human populations; and the study of
primates.

Medical Anthropology is the study on how people conceptualize and deal with
illness and wellness. The department has strong ties with the College of
Medicine, the School of Nursing and the School of Public Health. The Medical
Anthropology focus allows for a concentration on ethnomedicine, ethnobotany,
ethnopharmacology, and cognate themes.

**Ecological Anthropology** is focused on human interactions with tropical
forest environments, both in Hawaii and Southeast Asia.

**Ethnobotany / Ethnopharmacology** weigh more heavily the human and cultural
component than research by a botanist or pharmacologist. This concentration
emphasizes a theoretical perspective, more so than geographic.

The department has awarded 316 MA degrees and 164 PhD degrees since its
inception in 1930. Currently, the department has about 75 graduate students,
approximately 20 of which are doing fieldwork or writing dissertations off
island at any given time. The department draws graduate students who focus on
studies on Asia and the Pacific. The students tend to have extensive
experience living and working in foreign countries before coming to UH. Hawaii
itself is unique in its ethnic diversity. This wealth of life experience
provides a rich atmosphere for graduate students who contribute to stimulating
seminar discussions.

Graduate students at the MA level learn the fundamentals in their elected sub-
fields, and continue on for further specialization at the PhD level. Students
in the PhD program are to develop the following competencies:

  * broad knowledge of one anthropological sub-field,
  * deep and critical knowledge of the dissertation research topic thorough familiarity with the relevant literature concerning the geographic region researched capacity to design research projects which include the ability to: formulate problems, use concepts, employ appropriate methods in data collection, and relate empirical data to theoretical constructs,
  * capacity to write clearly and cogently, and to give effective oral presentations.

  
  
  
  
**Admission Requirements**  
  
All applicants must submit to the department GRE General Test scores and three
letters of recommendation at the time of application. Admission is in fall
semester only. Applicants for the MA degree must have either a BA degree in
anthropology or make up the undergraduate deficiencies with a course from each
of the sub-fields, with a "B" or better, during the course of MA study.
Applicants for the PhD program must have a master's degree in Anthropology.  
  
  
  
![](../../../../assets/fieldbutton/fieldbutton.gif)  
  
  
**Degree Requirements**  
  
  
**MA Degree Requirements**  
A candidate for the MA must take two out of four core courses (archaeology,
linguistic anthropology, physical anthropology, and cultural anthropology). A
core course may be repeated once. A student may take additional core courses
to fulfill other course requirements.

An MA candidate must also pass two courses in each of the following
categories: method or technique, theory or topic, and culture area. If a
candidate needs a course from one of the three categories in his or her
program of study and that course is not offered by the department on a timely
basis, he or she may petition the graduate chair to substitute a course from
outside the department, provided petition is made prior to registration for
the course in question. A candidate is required to earn 30 credit hours.
Normally, at least 18 credit hours must be taken in the department. In special
cases, a candidate may petition the graduate chair to waive this latter
requirement. Of the required course work, both plans require at least 18
credit hours in courses numbered 600 or above and approved by the candidate's
committee.

_Plan A_ _(Thesis)_  
24 credit hours of course work  
Thesis (6 credit hours)

_Plan B_ _(Non-Thesis)_  
30 credit hours  
Three papers on anthropological topics, one of which shall be a research
proposal to the committee as evidence of scholarly ability

  
**PhD Degree Requirements**  
A student completing the requirements for an MA may request admission to the
PhD program. In such a case, the committee will evaluate the MA thesis or
three papers and will review the quality of previous graduate work. This
evaluation will be made at a meeting of the student's committee, which may
make a recommendation to the graduate chair concerning admission. In addition
to the recommendation of each of the committee members, the graduate chair
will require written assessments of the student's course work from each
regular faculty member in whose course the student has been enrolled
(including 699). The assessment shall include a specific recommendation (or
abstention from recommending) to admit or deny admission to the PhD program.
Admission to the PhD program requires a two-thirds majority of favorable
versus unfavorable recommendations. This final evaluation and decision are
made after the meeting to evaluate the MA work. The results are communicated
to the student in writing by the graduate chair.

PhD candidates must fulfill the requirements for an MA degree in anthropology
as a prerequisite. Requirements for obtaining a PhD include submitting an
acceptable program plan at a candidacy conference, passing a comprehensive
examination, formulating an acceptable dissertation proposal, writing an
acceptable dissertation, and successfully defending this dissertation.

A student entering the PhD program with an MA degree in anthropology from
another institution must pass the core course in his or her area of
specialization with a grade of B (GPA of 3.0) or better. This course may be
challenged by examination in lieu of taking it for credit. All students are
required to take graduate courses (other than reading courses) from at least
four different members of the department. After admission to the PhD program,
the student's MA committee will be dissolved and the student will form a five-
member PhD committee. More members may be added if deemed desirable and
consistent with a candidate's interest. At least one person must be a graduate
faculty member of another department, but the majority of members must be from
the Department of Anthropology. Substitutions may be made at any time if a
member of the committee is unavailable.

All students entering the PhD program, including those obtaining an MA from
the department, are strongly advised to hold a candidacy conference and gain
written approval of their five-member committee for the projected program of
study by the second semester.

Approximately one semester prior to the comprehensive examination, the student
shall submit a detailed description of the areas to be covered, complete with
bibliography. The candidate is expected to have read the items contained in
the bibliography and be prepared to discuss them in some depth. It is the
responsibility of each committee member to suggest additional readings for the
bibliography and to suggest any other changes in the proposed agreement. After
all committee members have been duly consulted, the student will prepare a
final description to be signed by all concerned, including the student, and to
be filed with the graduate chair.

The comprehensive examination shall be administered in two parts: (a) a
written examination and (b) an oral exam, at which the student will be given
the opportunity to clarify and amplify answers to the written component. The
written exam will consist of one essay question submitted by each member of
the student's committee. It will be closed-book; students will not be
permitted to use notes or other aids. An allotment of three hours per question
will be given. Scheduling will be flexible, but the total exam must be taken
within a two-week period.

The oral examination is expected to be scheduled no earlier than one week and
no later than two weeks after the written examination. All members of the
committee must be present at the examination. At the oral exam the student
will be asked to explain and/or defend answers to the written component. Two
hours are to be allotted for this exercise.

If a student fails the comprehensive examination, he or she may be allowed to
repeat it. If this examination is failed a second time, the student will be
dropped from the graduate program. The committee will provide each student
with a written statement detailing the reasons for a negative decision.

After successfully completing the comprehensive examination, the student is
required to submit a research proposal for review by the degree committee. A
meeting of the committee will be scheduled within two weeks of submission of a
final draft of the proposal; the committee will determine whether or not the
student is adequately prepared for the fieldwork proposed. A candidate whose
field research proposal is approved and who has completed all other
requirements is eligible to receive a University ABD certificate.

A student conducting dissertation research among people who do not speak the
student's native language will be required, before leaving for the field, to
show evidence of oral competence in the most useful field language or of
training in linguistic field techniques.

Following the student's submission of a final draft of the dissertation, an
oral defense will be scheduled. It is the student's responsibility to see that
each member of the committee has a copy of the complete final draft of the
dissertation at least four weeks before the scheduled date of the oral
defense. The dissertation must be read by no less than three members of the
committee, and all members must be present at the oral defense. The Graduate
Division sets forth procedures for determining final acceptance of the
dissertation and awarding the PhD A candidate must complete all the
requirements within seven years after admission to the doctoral program. A
student unable to meet this deadline may request an extension by written
petition to the committee describing reasons for the delay. The committee's
recommendation will be sent to the chair of the graduate program and, if
approved, to the d

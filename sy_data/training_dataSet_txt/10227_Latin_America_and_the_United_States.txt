Description: As
      the saying goes, Latin America lies too far from God and too
      close to the United States. This proximity has affected Latin
      American economics, demographics, culture, and politics. The
      seminar will begin with an overview of US-Latin American relations
      from the Monroe Doctrine to the Bay of Pigs. We will then concentrate
      on the twentieth century. Students will then write a research
      paper using primary documents available here at Grinnell. These
      papers could focus on any one of a number of issues that were
      central to US-Latin American relations.
In addition to common readings,
      students will be asked to complete some short written assignments
      that are designed to help them complete their term paper.(See
      Assignments) Class participation is
      an integral part of the course, so attendance is mandatory.

Please note that most of the
      readings are available for purchase. Many are also on reserve.
      When you do the reading, keep in mind the question posed in the
      syllabus (see below). For purposes of discussion, be prepared
      to define (1) the authors main point, (2) the type of evidence
      used to make that point, (3) your assessment of whether the evidence
      and argument convincingly sustain the conclusions, and (4) the
      relationship to other works we have read.

Assignments:
      For each class meeting, you will be expected to have done
      the assigned reading and to be prepared to discuss it.
Over the course of the semester you will also be asked to
      complete four short assignments. One
      will be done for class on August 29, the
      second will be due September 26, the
      third will be due October 12, and the
      last will be due November 16. Keep these latter dates in
      mind as the semester proceeds. You will need to begin work on
      the third and fourth assignments well ahead of time. Do Not Let
      the Due Date Surprise You. These assignments are designed to
      help you choose a research topic and turn that topic into a research
      project. This research project will form the basis of the Research
      Term Paper that makes up the bulk of your grade. It is due December
      8 at noon.
When you prepare the papers you might want to consult the
      Guide
      to Writing a College Paper from the University of Chicago
      Writing Program. Those documents will give you a sense of my
      expectations in terms of writing. I am preparing a couple of
      pages that might help you revise your papers to meet my expectations.
      I strongly advise you to check them out once they are ready.






Grading:
      Class participation--including
      3 presentations (30%), 4 Short Assignments (20%), Research Paper
      (50%)

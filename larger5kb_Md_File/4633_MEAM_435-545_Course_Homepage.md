###  Course Description

Review of fluid kinematics and conservation laws; vorticity theorems; two-
dimensional potential flow; airfoil theory; finite wings; oblique shocks;
supersonic wing theory; laminar and turbulent boundary layers.

Fluid mechanics forces us to understand the underlying physics rather deeply.
This is because the results often defy our intuition.

Examples  
1\. Infinitesmally small  causes can have large effects (D'Alembert's
paradox).  
2\. Symmetric problems may have non-symmetric solutions (Karman vortex
street).  
3\. Friction can make the flow go faster and cool the flow (subsonic adiabatic
flow in constant area duct).  
4\. Roughening the surface of a body can decrease its drag (transition from
laminar to turbulent boundary layer separation).  
5\. Adding heat to a flow may lower its temperature.  Removing heat from a
flow may raise its temperature. (One dimensional diabatic flow in a range of
subsonic Mach number.)  
6\. Friction can destabilize a previously stable flow (Orr-Sommerfeld
stability analysis for a boundary layer profile without inflection point).  
7\. Without friction, birds couldn't fly and fish couldn't swim (Kutta
condition requires viscosity).

###  Prerequisites

Prerequisite(s): MEAM 302. This course is cross-listed with an advanced level
undergraduate course. It may be taken by M.S.E. students for credit. M.S.E.
students will be required to do some extra work, they will be graded on a
different grade scale than undergraduate students and they will be required to
demonstrate a higher level of maturity in their class assignments. MEAM
doctoral candidates will not be permitted to count this course as part of
their degree requirements.

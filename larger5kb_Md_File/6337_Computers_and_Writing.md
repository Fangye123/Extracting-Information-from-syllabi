### Syllaweb

The course will be an introduction to the field of computers and composition.
We will consider:

  * the (approximately) twenty-year history of the discipline, 
  * the changes that computers and networks bring to writing theory, practice, and pedagogy, 
  * the social and political issues raised by computer-mediated communication and the internet, and 
  * the possible future applications. 

We will focus primarily on networked communication, the internet, the web, and
hypertext. We will write email, bulletin board messages, MOO rooms, and web
pages. Readings will be from both print and electronic texts, and our
discussion will be both f2f and online.

In addition, we will work extensively on rhetorical skills, particularly as
applied to writing for the web. Web rhetoric is an emerging sub-discipline
that we're still struggling to understand. You should, by the end of this
course, have more understanding and expertise in web rhetoric than the
majority of those currently publishing on the web. (This course fulfills the
department's [upper-level writing requirement](/users/mieng/wiu/ugrad/WID.htm)
for undergraduates.)

#### Requirements:

  1. [Faithful attendance.](wiu/attendance.htm) Serious illness or family emergency are the only reasons for absence. (This is especially important in a summer course. If you need to be absent, please let me know in advance so we can make suitable arrangements.) 
  2. Equally faithful completion of reading assignments on time. 
  3. Web writing assignments will be worked on all semester; you should, however, have a reasonable draft on the indicated due dates. 
    * A [home page](480/homesites2000.htm) to be posted on the World Wide Web and linked to this syllabus. (See my [Technology Page](/users/mfbhl/wiu/tech.htm) for HTML guidelines.) 
    * A hypertext on the novel _Snow Crash,_ which will become part of the class's [_Snow Crash_ web site](480/snow.htm). 
    * A second hypertext which you prepare for for your students to use or a hypertext on a technology/computer/internet topic of your choice. 
  4. There will also be a couple shorter exploratory writings to be posted on the WebCT site. 
  5. Postings to the class [Bulletin Board](http://webct.www.wiu.edu/SCRIPT/mfbhl_ENG480/scripts/student/serve_bulletin?ENTER+all) at least five times a week. Postings can include responses to readings, to points raised in class, to one another's ideas and questions. All posts should observe standard [netiquette conventions.](/users/mfbhl/wiu/netiquette.htm)
  6. Participation. We will be acting as a discourse community, writing and talking in order to discover meaning. Your participation in the class discussion is essential. 
  7. Exploratory reading. I expect everyone to read whatever you can get your hands on relating to the Internet, email, hypertext, World Wide Web, etc, and to share what you discover on the bulletin board. 
  8. Net exploring. We will collectively explore internet resources: liservs and newsgroups, gopher, World Wide Web. You will share your discoveries with the class and include them in your home page. 
  9. Students taking the course for graduate credit will have an additional assignment TBA. 

Class meetings: Mondays and Wednesdays, 1:00-4:15. Saturday July 15, 9:00-4:00

Home page: 15%  
Snow Crash Project: 25%  
Hypertext project: 25%

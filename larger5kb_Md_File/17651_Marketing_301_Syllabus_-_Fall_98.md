|  | **The Essence of Marketing**

Marketing professionals are charged with the responsibility to attract, retain
and grow relationships with customers, suppliers and enterprise facilitators,
consistent with organization-wide objectives. Individuals throughout the
organization who also adopt these responsibilities recognize the critical role
of client focus in achieving the goals of the firm. The challenges of client
focus are met using tools that include customer analysis, market knowledge,
competitive analysis, marketing research, market segmentation and competitive
positioning. These methods result in developing offerings that reflect
customer-defined quality as well as pricing, distribution and promotion
decisions that further customer attraction and retention and nurture client
relationships.

**Majoring in Marketing**

The study of marketing prepares students for a broad range of domestic and
international career options. Opportunities are strong in marketing as
technology firms, government agencies, the non-profit sector, manufacturing
and service providers advance their efforts to be market and customer value
driven.

Training in marketing provides students with a solid background in marketing
concepts and practices such as market analysis and planning, segmentation and
positioning, marketing research, consumer behavior and product, distribution,
price and promotion manage-ment. Because marketing draws on diverse concepts
for its foundation and has both domestic and global contexts, students are
encouraged to study related fields such as psychology, sociology, demography,
economics, public policy, decision support systems, global studies, foreign
languages and culture.

The objective of the written assignment is to demonstrate additional knowledge
gained in a narrow topic of marketing. This goal is to be accomplished by
reviewing, summarizing and integrating a minimum of six sources on the issue
selected.

Begin by selecting a marketing topic that you would like to learn more about.
For topic ideas skim the long version of the chapter table of contents (vii -
xiv) or examine other marketing sources. **Industry, company, region or
country analysis are not acceptable topics.** Example paper titles include:

After obtaining approval of your topic from your professor, continue by
conducting on-line searches of articles in journals of the type listed on the
first two pages of the syllabus. This search is done by accessing GMU's
homepage <http://www.gmu.edu/>, click on 'Libraries & Research' under the
column 'Library Resources' click on 'Libraries' click on 'Electronic
Resources.' Under 'Electronic Texts' click on 'Journals' the click on
'SearchBank.' Other excellent electronic resources are 'George Mason Library
Catalog' and 'ALADIN.' Of course accessing 'old-fashion' hardcopy is also
acceptable.

For off campus searches see in 'Electronic Resources' click on 'What about
off-campus access?' and follow the directions. This service allows you to
identify yourself as a George Mason University student from an off-campus
computer. You will be required to enter your social security number and a
password. This service is not compatible with American OnLine but works with
other ISPs.

To conduct the web search for your URL sources, use several of the search
engines available in Netscape or Internet Explorer. I like[
http://pinstripe.opentext.com/](http://pinstripe.opentext.com/) for searches
that contain a known industry structure (e.g., medicine, education, and
agriculture). Also, _Alta Vista Search: Advanced Query_ , that accepts Boolean
logic (and, or, not, near) is excellent. _Alta Vista_ and _SearchBank_ can be
reached easily through my homepage [
http://mason.gmu.edu/~jharvey/](http://mason.gmu.edu/~jharvey), click on _'My
Favorite Links'_ and then on _'Search Engines.'_ Also, other valuable source
may be found in _'My Favorite Links.'_

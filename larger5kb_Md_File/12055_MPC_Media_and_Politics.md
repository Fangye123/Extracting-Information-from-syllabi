  | **Media, Politics and Election Day** |  
---|---|---  
  |  |

For over 200 years, Americans have been going to the polls to select their
leaders, vote on taxes, and decide other important issues.  The political
world has been invaded by the media so much that it is sometimes difficult to
separate the two. As the result, spin, talking points and CNN's Larry King
have come to dominate the American Political Process.  Thanks to the media, we
have more information about politics and government than ever before .  Are we
a better country because of it -- or has politics been cheapened to the point
that no one trusts it anymore?  
  
We'll look at those questions in Media, Power and Culture.  See you in class!

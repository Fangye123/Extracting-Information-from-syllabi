**Goals of the Course:** This course is a historical survey of major Eastern
religious traditions. While a fully comprehensive treatment of each would be
impossible, we will use a comparative methodology to examine a significant
number of specific themes in all religious traditions studied. Students thus
develop a strong background in the structural components of religion in
general and a sense of the specifics of each tradition in particular. Some of
these themes include:  
  

  * **Ultimate Concern and Goals:**
    * What does it mean to be "liberated" or "saved"? 
    * Theories of an afterlife, heavens
    * "Worldly" goals
  * **Means to one's goals:**
    * Religious observances
  * **Authority/Government:**
    * Relationships between church/state, real/ideal hierarchies:
      * Monk/Laity
      * Master/Disciple
      * Role of scripture
      * Tradition
  * **The World/Universe:** The nature of this and other worlds and realities 
  * **Transcendent, Ultimate Reality:**
    * Doctrines
    * Variations of theology and practice 
  * **Human Nature:**
    * Relation to a Transcendent, if any
    * Multiple lifetimes
    * Bodhisattvahood
    * Celestial beings
    * Prophecy
    * Relation of humans to each other: gender, class, and race 
  
Our books employ different approaches popular in modern Religious Studies to
acquaint the student with the methodological variations in what is now the
multidisciplinary study of religion. These include: a multidisciplinary, but
primarily ethnographic approach to Hindu goddess worship; a philosophy of
religion treatment of Chinese Pure Land Buddhism; and a historical study of
Shinto and the Japanese state.  
  
Your grade will be determined by attendance and participation in class
discussions (5%), one mid-term (30%), a final (40%) and one 12-15 page double-
spaced written report (25%, due December 4). In the report, you will compare
and contrast your experience and findings on field trips to two different
centers of worship or meditation based in two different religions studied in
this class. Suggestions will be given on possible field trip sites. You will
receive class credit for these trips in lieu of meeting for class the day
before Thanksgiving. Study guides will be handed out prior to both tests. The
final will include a comprehensive comparative question over all the
semester's work. This comprehensive question will be stated verbatim in
advance on the study guide.

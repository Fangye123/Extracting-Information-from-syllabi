Charles Townshend, _The Oxford History of Modern War_. Oxford University
Press. ISBN 0-19-285373-2.

**Course Objectives**  
This course is a survey of European military history from the ancient world to
1939. Because it is a survey course, we will not have the opportunity to give
as much attention as you may desire to every important, interesting, and
controversial topic. However, we will discuss a wide range of issues about
which you will be expected to think and form your own opinions. Military
history is about more than generals and battles (what some historians like to
call  "Guns and Drums History"). We will spend much of our time discussing
things like technology, professionalism, administration, and military policy
-- the less glamorous but equally important components of a balanced overview
of military history. Rote memorization will do you little good in this class;
be prepared to think for yourselves. You are strongly encouraged to make use
of the instructor's office hours throughout the semester.

**Course Requirements - Undergraduates**  
The instructor expects each student to keep up with the schedule of readings
that appears on this syllabus. You will have a much better idea of what's
going on if you have done the reading. These assignments, along with
information from the lectures and discussions, will provide the material for
the exams. There are 310 possible points to be earned in this class. There
will be two (2) essay/ID exams, one at midterms and one during finals week.
Each exam will be worth 100 points. Bring a big bluebook and pen(s) to each
exam. You will also write a short research paper worth 100 points, which is
explained in more detail below. A preliminary bibliography for the paper will
be worth 10 points. Your course grade is determined by your average and is
based on a standard 10-point scale.

**THERE WILL BE NO CURVE.**

**Term Paper**  
Everybody in the class has different interests which may or may not be covered
in the lectures or the readings. The term paper gives you the chance to
explore a topic that you find particularly interesting. I recognize that some
of you may not have written this kind of paper before. If that is the case,
make sure you talk to me early in the semester so I can get you on the right
track. This paper is not an exercise in torture -- it should be **fun**. You
will want to consult the [European Military History Research Paper
Guidelines](../guides/eurmilguidelines.html) througout the process.

> TOPIC

>

> You may choose any appropriate topic between the 5th century BCE and 1939
that is relevant to the class. All topics must be approved by the instructor
no later than September 20th. Approval requires a one-on-one consultation
during my office hours. I will be as flexible as possible on topics. If you're
not sure about a topic, we'll sit down together and find one that interests
you.

>

> BIBLIOGRAPHY

>

> You will turn in a bibliography at the beginning of class on October 18th.
Ideally, the bibliography will contain both primary and secondary source
materials, with separate sections for each. However, I recognize that primary
materials will not be available for some topics. My rule of thumb will be the
following: if primary sources are readily available, either at USD or
realistically through interlibrary loan, they must be used. Secondary sources
must include a combination of monographs and journal articles. The
bibliography should be as complete as possible by this time.

>

> FORMAT

>

> The text of the paper will be not less than 8 nor more than 10 pages in
length. I will stop reading at the bottom of page 10. It must be double
spaced, typed in a standard 12-point font with appropriate margins, and have
page numbers in the upper right hand corner of the page. Endnotes should start
on a separate page after the text, and are not considered part of the 8-10
pages. Notes should be used for citing both direct quotations and ideas that
appear in the body of the paper. The notes and format will follow the style
used in the History Department's [Guide For Writing Research
Papers](http://www.usd.edu/history/deptguid/deptguid.htm). The finished paper
must have a cover page listing the title of your paper, your name, the class,
and the date. Staple everything together in the upper left hand corner of the
page.

>

> THESIS

>

> Each paper must be built around an organizing thesis that demonstrates your
ability to interpret your sources. A thesis does not need to be particularly
complex to be effective, but it **must** be there.

>

> GRADING

>

> The paper is worth 100 points, or approximately 1/3 of your final grade. You
will automatically lose 5 points if you miss the deadline for choosing the
topic (September 20th). Your bibliography (due on October 18th) is worth an
additional 10 points. The paper is due at the beginning of class on December
4th. You will turn in both a hard copy of your paper and a disk containing
either a WordPerfect or Microsoft Word file of your paper. The paper will be
graded for grammar and style as well as content.

**Course Requirements - Graduate Students**  
Graduate students will meet the same requirements as the undergraduates.
However, you will write a research paper that is 20-25 pages long, plus notes.
It will be worth 200 points. You also have the option of writing an
historiographic essay of the same length instead of a research paper. If
necessary, I will provide a sample historiographic paper to give you an idea
of what is expected. In addition, you will write reviews of 4 additional books
related to your larger topic. Each review will be worth 50 points. We will
work out a schedule for turning in the reviews.

**Makeups**  
Makeups must be taken within two weeks of a missed exam and will only be given
if the student has a university-approved absence. **It is your responsibility
to arrange the makeup**. Unless there are extenuating circumstances, makeups
not completed within two weeks will have a score of zero entered on the
gradesheet. Students with unexcused absences will not be allowed to take a
makeup.

**Writing Identification Exam Questions**  
On identifications, keep three things in mind. First, identify the person,
place or thing so that I know that you know what it was. Next, put the item in
historical context so that your understanding of its place in history is
apparent. And finally, if possible, demonstrate that you understand why the
item was significant. Why did I ask you about it? What was its historical
contribution? [Identifications will be drawn from this list of lecture
terms.](../terms/eurmilterms.html)

**Writing Essay Exam Questions**  
When writing essays, it is important that you build your answer around some
kind of thesis statement. Be blunt and put your thesis in the opening
paragraph. The remaining paragraphs should strengthen your thesis while
answering the question. I often write essay questions that ask you to explain
different aspects of a basic question. You may find it easiest to make each of
these aspects the subject of its own paragraph. Be sure to support your essay
throughout with details from lectures and your readings. Make it **crystal
clear** to me that you understand the material. Finally, include a strong
conclusion where you tell me what you just told me in the rest of the essay.

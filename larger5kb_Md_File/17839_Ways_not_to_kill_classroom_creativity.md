  Nine Classroom  
Creativity Killers  
Marvin Bartel - 2001

* * *

  
**Introduction** This is my confessional.  Most of what I learn in art and in
teaching is direct result of mistakes I make. I become aware of problems after
something happens.  I get into habits that are hard to break.  It is hard for
me to see an issue until it presents itself in the form of failure.  Every
student is different, so teaching is never an exact science.  I am tempted to
be pleased if a few of my students do well.  It is when I wonder why some do
poorly, that I keep trying something different.  It is when I wonder why some
fail to enjoy what seems like so much fun for others, that I question what I
am doing.  Some of these points are 180 degrees from where I was when I
started teaching art.  Some are direct opposite the ways I was taught.  \--mb
\--- also see footnotes for more background.

* * *

#1. I Kill Creativity when I encourage Renting (borrowing) instead of Owning
ideas.  
Real artwork is based on the child's own experience, memory, observation,
and/or imagination.  Real artwork is not borrowed from other children or other
artists.  The definition of borrowing is "use it and give it back".  In a
sense it would be better to steal it.  Thieves take ownership.  They do not
intend to return what they take.  I stole this idea from Nick Lindsay, a good
friend and poet.  He is the son of poet Vachel Lindsay.

# 2. I Kill Creativity when I Assign Grades without providing Informative
Feedback.  
Grades without rationale give no useful information that helps a person be
creative.  Sometimes they punish instead of rewarding.  If grading is used as
punishment, it can motivate rebellion or passive resistance unless the student
is unusually mature.  When grading is needed in art, we can use an
accumulation of positive points including credit for growth and improvement
(longitudinal grading instead of normative grading).  Normative grading
assumes that there is a certain equal norm that everybody most achieve.  It
would be like forcing all children to be a certain height by a certain age.

# 3. I Kill Creativity when I allow Cliche Symbols to substitute for Original
or Observed Representation of Experience.  
Snoopy dogs, hearts, smiley faces, stick figures, formulas for drawing trees
or animals, ovals for people, and so on, are all counterproductive activities.
Would it not be more productive to spend the time generating some original
symbols that go beyond the "no brainers"?  
Can we encourage the use of imagination, observation, and memory?  Can we
prohibit Cliche production?

# 4. I Kill Creativity when I Demonstrate instead of having students Practice.  
I can sleep through a demonstration.  I can not sleep through a hands-on
practice lesson.  Tell me and I might remember a little while - if I listen.
Show me and I will remember a bit longer - if I pay attention.  Have me do it
- I learn it.  When I demonstrate, I still get quite a few questions about
what I "taught". When I direct a practice session nearly everybody feels
confident to do it again using their own ideas.  If a demo is the only way, I
find that it needs to immediately followed by practice, not by the final
product assignment.

# 5. I Kill Creativity when I Show an Example instead of Defining a Problem.  
I like to show the Art History, the Fine Art Exemplar, the multicultural
examples at the end of the lesson.  This allows us to use what we learn during
the media work experience as frame of reference for the example.

However, when not showing examples, I must provide a better problem
definition, more chances to practice the technique, and be particularly alert
to students who may be floundering at the beginning of a problem because they
are not accustomed to doing their own thinking.  Often, if students are not
accustomed to listening carefully, they feel lost if I do not show them what
it is supposed to look like.  In these cases, I repeat the problem definition
using different words, or I have them make a some sketches of what they think
might work.  I also have them make written lists of ideas to pick from.  Some
are not accustomed to thumbnailing.  They not used to the idea that they are
to originate ideas from their own lives, experiences, and concerns.  Few other
teachers ask this of them.

While "image flooding" may be inspirational, it can also be intimidating and
very suggestive.  It can be argued that image flooding creates slicker work,
but less creative thinking skills.  It may win the scholastic awards, but it
teaches us to go through life in other people's skins.  We never learn the
ecstasy of having original ideas.

# 6. I Kill Creativity when I Praise Neatness and Conformity more than
Expressive Original work  
Neatness is over rated.  Conformity (and even following the assignment too
slavishly) may be a negative indicator when assessing art.  Product centered
work may be thought of as very good slave training.  What I want is student
ownership.  I often imagine what it might be like to be one of those artists
cranking out "Starving Artist" oil paintings.  They are done in painting
factories.

# 7. I Kill Creativity when I give Freedom without Focus  
Good lessons provide some specific learning goals, practice objectives, and so
on.  If I ask students to do whatever they want to do, they do whatever they
already have learned in the past.  The amount of creative thinking may be
zero.  When there are limits, there is a better chance of having a challenging
task.  The teacher's challenge is to make the limits seem compelling and
interesting to the student. My job is to make the hard stuff easy and to make
the easy stuff hard.

# 8. I Kill Creativity by Making Suggestions instead of asking Open Questions.  
Too often I am so glad I have what seems like an intelligent answer that I
blurt it out without thinking.  When I do this I am taking away several
important things.  I make my students more dependent on me and less self-
reliant.  I teach them not to think for themselves.  Would it not be better to
bite my tongue \- to pause long enough to phrase a question or two that helps
students realize that what **they** think is important.  At other times I may
need to help them set up the needed experiment to find and answer.  I can
often simplify the problem by asking them to solve a smaller problem that
helps with the larger question.

# 9. I Kill Creativity if I Give an Answer instead of teaching Problem Solving
methods.  
Artists use a variety of problem solving strategies.  Some move things around
until they look "right".  Some know that they need to cause an accident (often
a series of accidents) and look for ideas in the accidents.  Some know that
they need to simplify.  Some need to work at creating new kinds of order from
chaos.  Some want to point out the problems of the world.  Some want to search
for more perfect beauty.  There are many methods of working aesthetically, and
I need to expose students to as many ways as feasible. It is not my
responsibility to answer the students questions.  It is my job to help the
students learn how to formulate questions that the students find compelling.
Hmm.  How could I have stated this as a question?

like to think it is because I encouraged them to trust themselves.

Lowenfeld said they were haptic instead of visual.  He encouraged them to be
expressive instead of realistic in their artwork. Competent visual observation
did not matter to him. However, In the final analysis the children themselves
never believe that it does not matter - nor should they.

**Footnote:  **  
I am grateful to the many thoughtful responses and stories this page has
stimulated among teachers everywhere.  I really learn a lot from the notes I
read from teachers out in the field.  If you have an idea or question about
anything you read on my pages, and if you are an art teacher or simply a
parent of a child, I am interested in your thoughts.  I get some feedback
through [Artsednet Talk.](http://www.getty.edu/artsednet/Talk/)   When I get
really busy, I have to forgo reading some listserves.  Feel free to copy the
comment to me.  I will respond to art teachers and parents who send me notes.

THE IVORY TOWER SYNDROME  
I admit to being "a college professor" and not spending as much time with
children as K-12 Art Teachers do.  I have periodically tested ideas by working
as an art teacher substitute in the public schools.  I make quite a few visits
to see what my student teachers are doing and how things are working for them.
I so help out in Sunday School and I frequently work with children that are
friends and relatives.

Our junior level methods students test our lessons in local classrooms.  This
has some limits, so if you try any of lesson on this site, we really value
your thoughts.  If you have a lesson that follows the theory described on this
page, I would love to get a copy of it.  I cannot promise that I would post it
here, but many of my best ideas are stolen, but I would give you credit if I
posted something based on your lesson.

My class of elementary education majors is very special to me.  Many come to
an art class with lots of fear about art making.  Unfortunately, in their
childhoods they had some teachers that did not know about the Creativity
Killers.  I am finding that the approaches to art making skills, art history,
aesthetics, and criticism that work with them are often the same things that
work with children in the schools.

OUR STUDENT TEACHERS  
While our student teachers are quite aware of my unorthodox theories, I
encourage them to learn as much as they can from their supervising teacher
while they are student teaching.  If our theories collide, I encourage student
teachers to do what they feel will best result in a positive evaluation at the
end by their supervising teacher.  Once they are in their own classrooms, they
will have more choices.  Most often the student teachers who work hard at
their preparation find that they can impress their supervising teacher with
some "slight improvements".  Many teachers after having a student teacher who
has been particularly creative, cannot wait to have another one.

DO I FOLLOW LOWENFELD?  
Yes, in a way I do.  My graduate school professor in Art Education was Dr.
Phil Rueschhoff.  He was a student of Dr. Viktor Lowenfeld.  We were told
interesting stories about the way Lowenfeld worked, but we did not have to
agree with all of it.

In practice, art teachers who were following their impression of Lowenfeld's
theories were leaving out too many important notions about art. I am quite
certain that this was a big reason for development of DBEA (discipline based
art education).

While I am pleased to see the content added by DBEA (art history, criticism,
and aesthetics was added to production), I am often bothered when these things
are taught by methods that threaten the idea that every child has a right to
learn to think for themselves based on their own perceptions of the world and
their lives.  I admit that Lowenfeld and Rueschhoff made me aware of so much
that I had never though about until after I was through college.

OBSERVATION DRAWING  
What I am attempting to do, is to keep the best aspects of DBAE and the best
aspects of the legacy left us by people like Lowenfeld. In my opinion
observational drawing is one thing that neither DBEA or Lowenfeld address
adequately.  Most of the Standards Statements that I see also are afraid to
ask for it. When I work with children, often the thing they wish for the most
is to be able to draw better. When I help them learn how to see things they
are amazed at themselves. If we are all concerned about our drop outs and the
"crisis of confidence" our children experience, we might do well to begin more
observation drawing in grade one or sooner.

Practice works. Those that do not draw, do not learn to see very carefully.
Lowenfeld said they were haptic instead of visual.  He encouraged them to be
expressive instead of realistic in their artwork. Competent visual observation
did not matter to him. However, in the fnal analysis the children themselves
never believe that it does not matter - nor should they.

It would be like saying those who have not naturally learned to read and write
on their own are just wired differently, so we should just teach them to talk
and sing instead.  Forget writing and reading.

I find that children can learn a few good methods and continue to teach
themselves observation and drawing.  This can be enjoyable homework.  Music
teachers know the value of learning skills when children are young and their
brains and bodies are still malleable. Also, I still believe in drawing from
**memory** and drawing from **imagination**.   These also remain very
important developmental tasks that are generally ignored in many non art
school rooms.

MY SuperDBAE DREAM  
I dream that art teachers can find ways to combine the development of basic
skills, the knowledge of art analysis, of aesthetics, of our rich art history,
and our rich multicultural heritage in art. I dream that there are ways to all
these things and still foster creativity of the most positive type that
encourages every person to  do good in the world. This is why I propose some
of changes that Creativity Killers suggests.  It is a work in progress.

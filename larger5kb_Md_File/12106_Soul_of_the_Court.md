Purpose of the Course

This course is designed as a writing seminar: it will introduce the student to
the varying judicial  
philosophies in conflict in contemporary American society, with a special
emphasis on the battle  
for control of the philosophical composition and direction of the United
States Supreme Court.  
The course will commence with a historical overview of the Constitutional
Convention of l787  
and a brief study of the influences upon the Founding Fathers who created the
Constitution.  
This study will be an analysis of the political, social, and economic
influences upon the American  
colonies and the subsequent controversy which led to the creation of the Bill
of Rights. Included in the introduction will be a brief discussion of major
theories about man, law, and society and how the Founding Fathers were
influenced by natural law theories. The introduction will be concluded with a
brief discussion of the republican form of government and the doctrine of the
separation of powers.

A historical analysis of the nineteenth century in terms of politics,
economics, and other factors  
will be discussed in relation to the evolving history of the Supreme Court.
This analysis will include the battles over Presidential nominations to the
Court, and its ever-expanding role in determining the direction of the law.
The discussion will focus on the role the United States Senate has played in
the confirmation process.

Some emphasis will be placed on the historical factors which led up to the
composition of the  
Warren Court and how that Court helped shaped contemporary society by its
activist interpretation of the Constitution. Several major decisions rendered
by the Warren Court will be studied in order to afford the student an
understanding of the rulings of the Supreme Court in the 60's and 70's.

One major thrust of the course will focus on the hotly-contested battle for
the nomination of  
Robert Bork to fill a manjor vacancy on the Supreme Court in 1987. The battle
over the Bork  
nomination contains a historical overview of the political, social, economic,
and public interest  
forces which came into conflict over this highly-controversial figure. An in-
depth study of the  
Bork nomination will assist the student in understanding how nominations to
the High Court  
became highly political in the twentieth century. All aspects of the Bork
nomination and subsequent confirmation hearings will be studied to enlighten
the student about the political process interacting with philosophical forces
in the fight to control the future direction of the Court.

Also discussed, in less detail, will be the nomination and confirmation battle
over Clarence  
Thomas to the Supreme Court. This will update the continuing saga of the
political process and  
players attempting to shape the future of the Supreme Court, and how each
major political party learned from the Bork experience and approached the
Thomas hearning from different perspectives.

  
Some aspects of the Thomas confirmation hearing, will be reviewed and analyzed
within the  
sociological context of the Supreme Court philosophical struggles.

There will be a brief review of subsequent changes in confirmation process in
the aftermath of  
The Thomas confirmation battle. This will include a review of procedural
changes involving the  
Senate Judiciary Committee and how Court observers believe the Thomas
experience battle may have affected future nominations to the Court.

Subsequent appointments to the Court will be briefly reviewed. The elevation
of Ruth Bader  
Ginsburg to the Court in l993 and the more recent appointment of Steven Bryer
will lead to a  
brief discussion of the implications created by these appointments and the
role they have played in maintaining a strong Court center and how they
provide balance for future decision-making of the Supreme Court.

A major portion of the course will focus on the so-called failed conservative
judicial revolution:  
how Presidents Reagan and Bush attempted to challenge the liberal legacy of
the Warren and  
Burger Courts. A key aspect of this study will include how the Rehnquest Court
is functioning  
at a critical juncture in modern Supreme Court history. Major areas of
Rehnquest Court  
deliberations will be reviewed; (1) racial discrimination and the plight of
affirmative action,  
(2) abortion, (3) the death penalty, (4) rights of privacy, and (5) First
Amendment freedoms. Finally, some predictions may be offered concerning the
future direction of the Court in the beginning of the new millinium and what
major issues the Court will address in the near future and how the changes in
the make-up of the Court might affect the future direction of constitutional
law.

It is anticipated the final paper will emerge from within the context of these
broad areas of  
evolving law being shaped and refined by the present day Court.

Specific Objectives of the Course

l. To introduce the student to conflicting methods of interpreting the
Constitution  
2\. To study various philosophies of Constitutional interpretations  
3\. To examine the historical meaning of the Constitutional Convention and
what influenced the  
Founding Fathers  
4\. To trace the historical development of the United States Supreme Court, as
it evolved from a  
relatively weak branch of government into a major source of power and
influence in the twentieth century  
5\. To observe the interaction between the political process and the court
system in modern society, with emphasis on personalities, philosophy,
economics, the role of the media, interest groups, and the role public opinion
plays in deciding who serves on the Supreme Court  
6\. To examine how the role of the Supreme Court has evolved into a major
influence in the  
shaping of contemporary society, and how that role is quite different from
that contemplated  
by the Founding Fathers  
7\. To observe how the roles of political parties have shaped Constitutional
history in a manner not contemplated by the Framers  
8\. To learn how a power struggle inside the Rehnquist Court continues today
over the future  
direction of High Court decisions  
9\. To understand the implications of how future Presidential elections might
affect the selection  
of Supreme Court justices and how the philosophical composition of the Court
may shift  
thus possibly the precedents and case law of the past

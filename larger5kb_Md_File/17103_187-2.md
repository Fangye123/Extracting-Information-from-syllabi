**Description**  
How did the United States become the sole military, economic, political, and
cultural superpower in the world? What can the history of the U.S.'s global
position teach us about the potential wars and conflicts that we might see in
the 21st century? In this course we will explore the U.S. and the world in the
20th century, paying particular attention to the post-1945 period. We will
study U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East, Asia, Latin America, and Eastern
Europe, focusing not only on the patterns and problems of military
intervention, but also examining issues of mass culture, economic control, and
race/racism. We will look at important topics such as the emergence of
multilateral organizations, the creation of the intelligence agencies, and
conflicting definitions of war and terrorism. Students will be asked to
understand the United States from differing global perspectives and to
seriously consider the origins of resentment towards the U.S. and prospects
for peaceful coexistence in a highly-technologized and asymmetrical global
system.

**Course Requirements**  
1\. Attendance: Regular attendance is exceedingly important and completely
expected. It will count towards 20% of your evaluation or grade. You are
allowed one unexcused absence; if you miss additional classes you will need to
provide an explanation or documentation.  
2\. Weekly paper: Most Tuesdays (7 total) you will hand in to your TA a 2 page
paper summarizing and analyzing an article from the foreign press on some
aspect of U.S. foreign policy, politics, or culture. You will follow news
analysis or editorial articles of one press throughout the duration of this
course. Class and section discussions will be based in part on this
assignment. [ Click here to go to a list of foreign
newspapers](foreignpress.htm) \-- these are suggestions you may choose your
own, but let me know what paper and which language. [Click here for Weekly
Assignment Guidelines](weeklyassignments). BETWEEN THE 8TH AND 10TH WEEKS OF
CLASS, GROUPS DIVIDED ROUGHLY BY REGION WILL MAKE 30 MINUTES PRESENTATIONS
BEFORE THE CLASS. THIS MEANS YOUR FINAL WILL BE SHORTER! [Click here for GROUP
LISTS AND PRESENTATIONS DATES](newspapers.htm).  
3\. [Midterm Exam:](187-2midterm.htm) You will all be given a fairly
conventional midterm during the fifth week of class that will be due the
following week. It will consist of a set of definitions and two medium-length
essay questions (you will be given a choice). Strong and thoughtful exams will
indicate that you have done all the readings, attended class, and thought
seriously about some of the course's key themes. The midterm will count for
25% of your evaluation or grade.  
4\. [Final Exam:](187-2final.htm) You will be given a final exam with 2 essay
questions and 3-6 definitions that will be due one week after I hand it out.
THERE WILL BE NO EXTENSIONS OR ATTACHMENTS!

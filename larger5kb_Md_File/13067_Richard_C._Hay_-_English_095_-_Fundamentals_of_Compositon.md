        Welcome to English 095! This course is primarily designed to help you become a better and more proficient writer at the college level. But beyond that, this course aims to aid you in developing necessary critical reading skills and in writing well across many disciplines to a variety of audiences. Simply put, this class will strive to teach you how to formulate an idea and communicate that idea to others using your written communication skills.   
        This course will help you meet the demands of college level writing through a selection of assignments and discussions specifically designed to enable you to meet several end-of-course expectations. By the end of the course, you should: 

  1. Understand the writing process, including the generation and organization of ideas, the drafting and revision processes, and the production of a final work. 
  2. Be able to write for a specific purpose, audience, context, and genre in order to shape the meaning and the function of your writing. 
  3. Be able to write clear, organized, developed, and focused expository and argumentative thesis statements and essays that employ correct mechanics, grammar, and MLA stylistic format. 
  4. Read the writings of others and evaluate those writings from a critical standpoint being able to provide both key points from and well thought out responses to those essays. 
  5. Become a reflective practitioner of the writing process - that is, develop the ability to stand outside your own writing and both observe and critique yourself. 
        Although at times, this course will be difficult and time consuming, the skills that you learn will become invaluable in your college studies and eventual career. If you ever have any questions, need additional information, feel overwhelmed, or just want to talk, do not hesitate in contacting me directly at any of the methods above. Let's have a great semester!

### Course Assignments and Grades

### Formal Writing Assignments

        The majority of your grade and work in English 095 will be in preparing four formal essays that will deal with a variety of writing topics and ideals. At the end of the semester, you will submit your Reflective Analysis paper (essay #4) along with two other papers of your choice from essays #1-3 for inclusion in your final portfolio. Even though your final portfolio will only contain three of the four papers that you write, you are required to successfully complete all of the formal written assignments. Failure to do so will result in a failing grade for the course   
        Throughout the semester, you will only be required to hand in one rough draft of each of the five essays. But since the final portfolio counts for so much, I strongly suggest handing in multiple revisions of the three essays that you choose to include in your final portfolio. I am more than willing to comment and work with you on these essays and am here to help you succeed not only with the individual assignments, but also with the final portfolio.   
        Well before the due date of any formal writing assignment, you will receive a detailed assignment information sheet and a copy of the information sheet will appear on the class website. On the sheets, you will be given information such as the purpose of the assignment, intended audience, required format, due date, and expectations. Even though the formal writing assignments will each be extremely diverse in content, they will all follow some basic rules and guidelines:   
        All formal writing assignments should be typed and double-spaced with one-inch margins on all sides. You should also use a standard font (such as Arial or Times New Roman) at a size no larger than 12-point and you should always follow MLA guidelines when formatting your paper and citing sources. We will discuss MLA guidelines in class, but you can also review them on both the class website and in The New Century Handbook in chapter 14. Finally, please remember to proofread all assignments before bringing them to class or handing them in. Neglecting to proofread will reflect negatively on my evaluation of your work. 

### Informal Assignments

        Throughout the semester, you will encounter many other assignments that will aid in your understanding of a particular idea, process, or reading. These assignments are much simpler and will require substantially less time than the formal writing assignments, but are, nonetheless, extremely important and carry significant weight in the figuring of your final grade.   
        The majority of informal assignments will deal with the assigned readings and may come in the form of announced and unannounced quizzes, short response papers, or homework questions. Over the course of the semester, you will also encounter several other types of assignments including in-class writing and freewriting. Any informal assignment that is not an in-class writing assignment or a quiz will be assigned and discussed at least one class before being due and will also appear on the class website the night that they are assigned. 

### Grades

        In this class, your final grade will be figured based on the following percentages: 50% -Final Portfolio; 20% -Informal Assignments; 15% -Formal Assignment Drafts; 15% -Class Participation.   
        English 095 uses a portfolio system in evaluating your formal essays. At the end of the semester, you will submit your portfolio containing three essays to be evaluated by a group of other 095 instructors. After reading your essays, they will assign your portfolio either a "clear pass", "pass", "fail", or "clear fail". If your work receives a "clear pass" or "pass", then I will assign you a grade ranging from A to C. If you receive a "fail" or "clear fail", you will receive a C- to F and you will have to retake the class.   
      &nbspA; portfolio system allows you to present your best works for your final grade, but it prevents you from knowing your grade until the end of the semester. However, from the marks that you receive on your informal assignments and formal assignment drafts, and from the responses that I write on your essays, you should have a pretty good idea of where you stand. In addition, you will receive a midterm evaluation that we will discuss in detail during conferences. I would also be happy to meet with you anytime to discuss your work and progress in the class.

### Course Policies

### Attendance and Late Work

        Because this class will be covering different topics in almost every class period, your attendance, discussion, and interaction with both myself and your fellow classmates is vital. Even a single absence will cause you to fall behind. Although any absence may affect the class participation portion of your grade, the English Department has instated a specific attendance policy for 101 classes: 

  * If you miss more than six classes (the equivalent of two full weeks of classes), you will automatically fail the course and must repeat it. 
  * There are no such things as excused and unexcused absences in this course. Rather, any absence from class will count against the total allowed absences.
      &nbspEven; though you may miss up to six classes and still pass the course, you can only miss three classes without your class participation grade being lowered (your class participation grade begins at an 'A' and will remain at that level as long you miss no more than three classes and participate regularly in class discussions). Save your three free absences for when you need them - such as when you are sick or have an emergency. If you know ahead of time that you will be absent, please let me know in advance. This will enable us to work together to help you stay caught up. Also, if you miss, be sure to check the website for any material that was covered during your absence or any assignments that were made.   
      &nbspFinally;, be aware that I take attendance at the beginning of every class. If you are not there, I will count you absent. If you are late, please come into the class with as little disruption as possible. Also, be sure to check with me after class to make sure that I changed your absence to a tardy in my attendance record. Three 'tardies' count as one absence. Please be aware that late work will receive half-credit for the assignment and late portfolios will not be accepted. Also, if you must turn in a Formal Writing Assignment late, you will have two weeks from the due date to submit the assignment. If I have not received the Formal Writing Assignment by the end of that two week period, you will fail the course, Late work is defined as any work that is not received at the beginning of the class on the day that it is due. 

### Class Website

        The class website, available at www.uwm.edu/~rchay, was designed to provide you an additional medium in which you can benefit from this class. On the website, you will find the traditional information that you would suspect, such as the syllabus, assignment information, and class calendar. In addition, the website also contains several additional resources including an information page with articles on everything from plagiarism, to quotes about writing, to the hours of the UWM Writing Center. Also, the website has a discussion board where you can post questions and ideas and have myself and your fellow classmates respond and a chat room where you can meet myself and fellow students online. Assignments and handouts will appear on the website the day that they are assigned in class. Please check the website twice a week. 

### Academic Dishonesty

        Academic dishonesty including plagiarism, cheating, or submitting another person's material as one's own, violates university policy and is unacceptable in this class and in the academic community in general. Whenever you draw on the ideas or language of another writer, you must clearly indicate your source. We will talk more about plagiarism in class, but if you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate in asking me, consulting chapter 23 of Allyn and Bacon Guide to Writing, or reading the plagiarism information on the class website. 

##### _If you have a chronic health condition or disability which may
interfere with your attendance or ability to complete any of the assignments,
you must register with a counselor at the Student Accessibility Center
(Mitchell 116, 229-6287) and schedule a meeting with me within the first two
weeks of classes._

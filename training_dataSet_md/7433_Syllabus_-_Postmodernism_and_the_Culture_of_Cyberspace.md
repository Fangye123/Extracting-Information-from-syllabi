### **Description:**

What is cyberspace and how does it relate to the literature, movies, music,
art, lifestyles, politics, and sexuality of the postmodern world?  The word
"cyberspace," coined by the science fiction writer William Gibson in 1984,
refers to the virtual world created by communication over the internet.
Debates about this new mode of experience swirl around questions of
pornography on the internet, hacking, race and gender stereotypes, First
Amendment rights, freedom of information, and copyright.  Literary scholars
argue about how computers will transform research, textual editing, models of
reading and writing, and the nature of literature.  Novelists and film makers
attempt to imagine the future of a wired society, while corporate culture
strives to cash in on the World Wide Web.  
  
This course will explore the emerging culture of cyberspace through readings
of cyberpunk fiction; novels about the boundary between human and artificial
life; movies that use cyborgs and virtual reality to speculate about the role
of technology in society; hypertext fiction, which must be read on the
computer and attempts to banish linear sequence; critical writing about the
future of the internet; and literary theory, including works on the nature of
postmodernism, the definition of cyberspace, and the future of criticism,
scholarship, and editing in an age of hypertext.  
  
No computer expertise is required.  Although there will be frequent
assignments requiring access to the World Wide Web, the techniques for using
the net will be explained for those who have no previous experience.  Each
student will construct his or her own Web page; the class will have its own
interactive computer bulletin board; and all writing assignments will be
turned in and graded by email. Computer illiterates and rank beginners are
encouraged to sign on.

* * *

### **Readings:**

  * Most assigned readings will be on the web.
  * Photocopied materials will be available in the Reserve Room of the Library.  They may be checked out for 2 hours.
  * Shelley Jackson, _Patchwork Girl_ (Eastgate Systems disk, Rand Bookstore)
  * Wiiliam Gibson, _Neuromancer_ (Rand Bookstore)
  * Richard Powers, _Galatea 2.2_ (Rand Bookstore)

**2001 UM Catalog Data:**  
CSCI 517. Natural Language Processing. Computer processing of natural language
text at morphological, lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels; algorithms and
procedures for sentence parsing and analysis; applications of natural language
processing techniques. (3)  
  

* * *

  
  
**Prerequisites:**  
There are no specific prerequisite courses. It is assumed that all students
enrolled in this class will have advanced expertise in computer science or a
discipline closely related to natural language processing. Upperclass
undergraduate students are eligible to take this course; graduate students are
eligible to take the course.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Textbook:**  
Instead of a textbook, readings will be assigned, put on reserve in the
library, and distributed in class as handouts. Web resources will also be
specified as homework/reading activities.  
  
The book that was originally planned as the textbook for the course may prove
to be a useful reference source:  
Daniel Jurafsky  & James H. Martin:  
_Speech and Language Processing: An Introduction to Natural Language
Processing, Computational Linguistics, and Speech Recognition_  
Prentice Hall, 2000; ISBN 0-13-095069-6  
  
The bookstore on the University of Mississippi campus, and other bookstores in
Oxford, should have copies of that book available for you to purchase, but
buying a copy of the book is not required.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Course goals:**  
The purpose of this course is to give students opportunities for study of
topics related to advanced string processing, natural language processing,
natural language software interfaces, computational linguistics, and other
related issues.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Applicability of CSCI 517 to degree:  
** CSCI 517 is not a required course. It can count as an undergraduate or
graduate elective. For CS master's students, CSCI 517 counts as an
"application area" distribution course. Consult with your advisor if you have
any questions about the role of CSCI 517 in your program of study.

**[Sitting in on the class:](../sitting.html)**  
If you would like to "sit in on the class" without being enrolled in any way,
[click here](../sitting.html) to review my guidelines concerning this
practice.  
  

* * *

  
  
**[Lab facilities and Java software:](../software.html)**  
Students can complete programming exercises for this class using lab
facilities located in the CS department in Kinard Hall. [Click here to go to
the online account application
page,](http://www.cherry.cs.olemiss.edu/account/request.jsp) where you can
fill out an online form to obtain your personal logon account for the Kinard
Hall CS labs.  
  
Students who have access to their own PCs can use them for completion of
exercises.  
  
All of the software needed for completion of the programming exercises can be
obtained at little or no cost. See the separate page concerning [Java
software](../software.html) for additional information.

This course examines selected topics on pre-colonial, colonial, revolutionary,
early national, and nineteenth century America (through the Civil War and
Reconstruction). As one of the historical studies options in the university's
general education curriculum, this course will treat our nation's social,
economic, political, and diplomatic history as more than a body of knowledge
accumulated over generations by historians and other specialists. Students
will examine, study, and discuss primary sources and will think about our past
as historians themselves. Lectures and discussions will focus on both broad
and selected topics as well as more narrow subjects of interest to the
instructor and the students.

Reading of selected primary and secondary sources and two formal writing
assignments are additional requirements of this course. **Purchase the
following books from the bookstore today:**

**_America: A Narrative History_ , Vol. One (5th ed., 1992), by George B.
Tindall and David E. Shi**. Readings in Tindall and Shi will serve as the
basis for essential core information and for discussion of several topics not
treated in lectures.

**_Portrait of America,_ Vol. One: From Before Columbus to the End of
Reconstruction (7th ed., 1999), edited by Stephen B. Oates.** Readings in
Oates will serve as the basis for discussions in class.

**_What They Fought For, 1861-1865_ (1995) by James M. McPherson.** Reading
this brief monograph is related to the research paper assignment involving,
also, use of the Internet history site, Valley of the Shadow Project.



**The first formal paper for this course will be the critical review of a
self-selected biography in Boatwright Memorial Library.** For more information
on this assignment, refer to the separate information pages on the website for
this course.

**Students must also submit a second and longer research paper using an
Internet history site, the Valley of the Shadow Project and the book by
McPherson**. For more information on this assignment, refer to the separate
information pages on the website for this course. This research will involve
the history of the Civil War in Virginia and Pennsylvania. Students will use
several types of both primary and secondary sources used commonly by
historians.

Students must take a **mid-term exam** and a **final exam**. These exams will
consist of essay and identification questions, and the final exam will be
comprehensive. A make-up mid-term exam is offered only in cases of illness or
death in the student's family, and a make-up of the final exam is offered only
with your dean's approval.

**In determining the final course grade** , the mid-term counts 25%, the final
exam counts 30%, the critical book review counts 20%, and the Internet-based
research paper counts 25%. Participation in class discussions will be
monitored and, evidence of quality participation may be useful in resolving
final grade decisions in borderline situations. Because of the already heavy
reading, writing, testing, and discussion demands of this course, no extra-
credit assignments will be required or permitted.

**Students are responsible for the work of all classes whether present or
not**. It is your responsiblitiy to request handouts you missed receiving, to
obtain notes from other students, and to anticipate the next assignments from
reading the Course Syllabus. An excused absence is an absence involving
personal illness, death in the family, appearance in court, or participation
in university-sponsored events authorized by your dean. It is your
responsiblity to assure that the instructor records absenses as excused or
otherwise.

**Students absent without explanation and/or for circumstances other than the
ones above will receive unexcused absences.**

**Students with more than three absences of any kind before mid-semester will
be advised to withdraw from the class, and more than four absences during the
semester have in the past adversely affected the final course grade for
students in this class.**

The instructor joins the Honor Councils on campus in calling attention to two
items. The following **pledge shall be used** on all forms of testing and on
all written work for this course:  "I pledge that I have neither received nor
given unauthorized assistance during the completion of this work." Students
shall sign names in full following the full pledge. The following definition
of plagiarism is contained in the Honor Code: "the deliberate presentation,
oral and/or written, of words, facts, or ideas belonging to another source
without proper acknowledgement." Students will be instructed on how to avoid
accidental plagiarism.

**NOTE: If you have taken the Advanced Placement Test on American History, you
may not receive credit for this course if your test score was 4 or 5. It is
your responsibility to check with the Office of the Registrar about academic
credit for such test results. Do not remain in this class or any other section
of History 205 without resolving this matter.**

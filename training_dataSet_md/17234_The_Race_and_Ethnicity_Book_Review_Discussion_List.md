POS334-L is a discussion list constructed for the Race, Ethnicity and Social
Inequality seminar (formerly numbered POS302) held each spring semester at
Illinois State University. Subscription to the list is open to all faculty and
students at any University or College. The discussion on the list consists of
book reviews and commentaries on book reviews submitted by the subscribers.
The purposes of the list are to provide an audience for the work of the
students in the seminar, to provide the seminar with an external source of
opinion and insight on the readings under discussion, and to provide all
subscribers with an public forum for the discussion of contemporary books on
race, ethnicity, and social inequality.** **The list is hosted by theMatrix
center at Michigan State University.  **

**Graduate and Undergraduate students are especially encouraged to submit book
reviews to the list and to participate in the discussions.   Faculty are
encouraged to use this list with their classes.  **

**The discussion list is open for reviews of books on race and ethnicity at
any time, including books that are not on the class schedule. **

####  FORMAT AND CONTENT OF REVIEWS:

Messages sent to the list ( **POS334-L@H-net.msu.edu** ) will be automatically
sent out to all subscribers. Please limit such messages to one of two formats:
1) a book review, or 2) a commentary on one or more of the reviews. As a
general rule reviews should be between 1,000 and 2,500 words.

A schedule for the book reviews is at the end of this message. It indicates
the first day of a two-week period for submitting a book review. Please try to
send reviews of these books within the two week time period. Reviews of books
not on the schedule may be sent at any time.

The subject field of the message should contain the word REVIEW followed by
the name of the author of the book, and your last name in parentheses. e.g.:

subject: REVIEW: Derrick Bell (Lyle)

The discussion list archive is indexed by the message subject headings, so
please adhere to the subject-field convention.

The text of the message should begin with a full citation of the work and the
name and affiliation of the reviewer and the date. A suggested format is shown
below:

Dinesh D'Souza, ILLIBERAL EDUCATION: THE POLITICS OF RACE AND SEX ON CAMPUS  
(The Free Press, 1991). Reviewed by:Gary Klass  
2/19/96

####  FORMAT AND CONTENT OF COMMENTARIES:

The POS334-L aims for serious and thoughtful academic discussion, it is not a
forum for stating personal opinions. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SENDING SHORT
SPONTANEOUS REACTIONS TO A BOOK OR REVIEW TO THE LIST. Commentaries should be
at least 100 words in length and should reflect a reading of the work or other
works of the author. Note that automatic replies to messages sent from the
list will normally go directly to the original sender, messages to the list
must be addressed to **POS334-L@H-net.msu.edu**

####  MODERATION:

Many of these works are controversial and the subject matter concerns a topic
that sometimes provokes heated exchanges in other settings. Rather than having
a formal set of standards for decency and good taste, the members of the class
at Illinois State will act as referees, upon majority vote of the class, I
will kick anyone off the list whose messages do not contribute to its general
educational purposes.

Please remember at all times that many of the people on this list are
students, that students are people, that they are trying to learn, and that
they will make mistakes and say things that are wrong. We learn from our
mistakes. It is just as important not to take offense as it is not to be
offensiv  e.

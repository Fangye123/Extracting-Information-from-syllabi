 **COURSE OVERVIEW**

![](../../images/clearpix.gif) All the major world religions have produced
traditions of right and wrong to address the moral issues of war and peace.
These traditions seek to answer such questions as whether resort to armed
conflict is ever justified, and if so for what reasons (the question of
justification); who has the right to initiate use of armed force and who does
not (the question of authority); what means may be used and who may be
targeted by such force (the question of right conduct); and the relation of a
community's use of armed force to the goal of peace among communities. In the
western religions, the normative influences of Judaism and Christianity are to
be found in the development of just war tradition, while the corresponding
normative tradition for Islamic thought centers on the idea of the jihad of
the sword and its place in the statecraft of the ideal Muslim community. This
course begins with a three-week examination of just war tradition in its
origin and development (Part I), follows with four weeks examining the
relation of religion to war in western and Islamic normative traditions (Part
II), and concludes with six weeks on moral issues raised in contemporary armed
conflict (Part III). Particular attention will be paid throughout to the way
the traditions studied deal with the the values of peace, justice, and
protection of the innocent.  

![](../../images/clearpix.gif)At the end of the first two parts what I call a
"directed paper" will be assigned (you may think of it as a take-home test).
For Part III you are asked to write a brief (6-8 pages if typed, approximately
1500-2000 words) paper on one of the subjects treated in this section. This
paper is due at the time the final exam is scheduled.

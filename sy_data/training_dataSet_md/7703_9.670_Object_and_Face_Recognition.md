**Lecture Details  
** Location: E25-202  
Times: Tuesdays and Thursdays 1-2:30

**Description  
** Provides a comprehensive introduction to key issues and findings in object
recognition in experimental, neural, computational, and applied domains.
Emphasizes the problem of representation, exploring the issue of how 3-D
objects should be encoded so as to efficiently recognize them from 2-D images.
Second half focuses on face recognition, an ecologically important instance of
the general object recognition problem. Describes experimental studies of
human face recognition performance and recent attempts to mimic this ability
in artificial computational systems. An additional project is required for
graduate credit.

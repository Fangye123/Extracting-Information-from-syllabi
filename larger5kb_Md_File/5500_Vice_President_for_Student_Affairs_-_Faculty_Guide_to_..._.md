**President's Message**  
October 1995  
To Faculty, Students, and Staff:  
The University of Virginia does not discriminate in education or employment on
the basis of age, color, national origin, religion, sex, or disability.
Affirmative action and equal opportunity programs, including grievance
procedures, meet all federal and state laws.  
The University seeks to accommodate its academic programs, related student
support services, and facilities to the needs of persons with all types of
disabilities. The University further aims to ensure that employment
opportunities are not denied to such persons.  
The University has made a substantial commitment to meeting the requirements
of Section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973 through construction
designed to increase the accessibility of our buildings. We have also created
a faculty-student-staff advisory committee on interests of persons with
disabilities. The committee began meeting in the spring of 1988. It examines
issues related to access to facilities, and other matters of interest to
persons with disabilities.  
Four University documents are especially relevant. They are the
"Institutional Self-Study on Access to Programs by the Handicapped" (June
1978), the "Transition Report on Removing Architectural Barriers to the
Handicapped (December 1977, revised April 1986), "A Plan for Equal Access"
UVa's Transition Plan (1993), and "A Plan for Equal Access: Vol. I & II,"
UVa's Self-Evaluation (1995). Copies of these reports are available in the
offices of the deans and vice presidents.  
I urge the entire University community to join the effort to make our
facilities and programs accessible to all of our members, including those with
disabilities.

**Coordinator's Report**  
The University of Virginia values diversity among members of our academic
community. Now that we have completed the University's Transition Plan to
remove Architectural barriers and the Self-Evaluation of program
accessibility, our attention has been focused on providing physical settings
and programs which enable persons with disabilities to express their ideas and
talents, thereby enriching the academic community. Federal and state
legislation addresses needed improvements in services for all persons with
disabilities--students, faculty, and staff as well as visitors and
participants in University and departmental activities. These laws provide
some direction for our efforts to become a more accessible learning
environment, but this environment will become reality only with our collective
commitment to this goal.  
The University has always been committed to service and advocacy beyond the
minimum legal requirements. The University Committee on Access for Persons
with Disabilities has increased awareness of issues such as facility
accessibility, challenges facing persons with  "hidden" disabilities, and
policies and procedures which hinder learning and achievement at the
University of Virginia. Such University-wide efforts allow us to share
information and resources effectively and equitably when addressing the
concerns of persons with disabilities.  
This booklet provides educators with information about certain disabilities,
pertinent laws and University resources. There are many other sources of
support for faculty, including the 504 Network and the Student Council
Committee on Independence for Students with Disabilities. The Learning Needs
and Evaluation Center plays a major role assisting students and faculty in the
development of accessible academic programs. The center provides testing,
auxiliary aids and other support services for students and makes
recommendations to faculty as to the range of options for reasonable
accommodation of students with disabilities.  
Just as we employ new teaching strategies to enhance the experience of all
students in a class, we may need to modify our instruction in order to share
our disciplines with students with disabilities. Without such accommodation,
these students may not be able to take full advantage of the educational
opportunities at the University. The support of faculty is essential for the
creation of an environment that values and welcomes diversity.

**Foreword**  
Five years after being signed into law, the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA) has impacted the experiences of students, faculty, and staff at the
University of Virginia. Colleges and universities as educators and potential
employers of persons with disabilities have increased access to their
facilities through construction and renovation of facilities. However, the
law's greatest and most indirect impact may be realized as persons with
disabilities become more aware of and confident of their rights.  
Post-secondary education can provide the preparation to take full advantage of
employment opportunities in business, industry and the professions. In order
for students with disabilities to benefit from this opportunity, an awareness
and understanding of students with disabilities must be created at the
University.  
This handbook is designed as a guide to help faculty members, administrators
and staff personnel understand their critical role in reasonably accommodating
the needs of students with disabilities. Students with disabilities and
faculty members both have rights and responsibilities in identifying
appropriate accommodations. This booklet serves as a preliminary guide to
address common questions about teaching students with disabilities. It also
should encourage the use of a network of persons who regularly resolve student
problems associated with reasonable accommodation. The list of this network
can be found on the inside of the back cover.

**The Student with a Disability**  
  
Under state and federal regulations (see Appendix A), a person with a
disability is identified as anyone with a physical or mental impairment that
substantially limits one or more of such major life activities as walking,
seeing, hearing, speaking, working, or learning. Further, a history of such
disability or the belief on the part of others that a person has such a
disability, whether it is so or not, is also recognized as a disability by the
regulation.

Conditions considered a disability include but are not limited to:  
  
|   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Alcoholism*  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Cancer  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Cerebral palsy  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Deafness/Hearing Impairment  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Diabetes  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Drug Addiction*  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Epilepsy  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Heart Disease  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Multiple sclerosis  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Muscular dystrophy  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Mental or emotional illness, including:  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Eating disorders, depression,  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Attention deficit disorder  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Orthopedic, speech, or visual impairments  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Perceptual Handicaps:  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Developmental aphasia  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Dyslexia  
  |   | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Minimal brain dysfunction  
  | *Ruled to be physical or mental impairments that are disabling conditions
if they limit one or more of life's major activities.  
  
While some of these conditions are readily identifiable, many are not.
Consider the following before you prejudge a student who may qualify for
accommodation:  

  | 1. | Students with disabilities at the University have qualified for
admission because of their abilities -- despite their disability, not because
of it.  
---|---|---  
  | 2. | Students with disabilities should be provided with the same
opportunities as any other students in class, including the right to
demonstrate excellence or to fail.  
  | 3. | If the student with a disability fails your examination, has he or
she failed "testing" or failed to learn the subject in which he/she was
tested?

**Suggestions for Classroom Accommodations**  
General  
Because each disability may require a different approach to reasonably
accommodating the needs of the student with a disability, it might prove
beneficial for the instructor to note in the class syllabus or to make an
announcement to this effect at the beginning of each semester and to each
class:  
"Any student who feels that he or she may need to discuss individual
accommodations, please make an appointment to see me during office hours."  
Such an announcement will help preserve the student's privacy, indicate a
willingness on the part of the faculty member to provide assistance, and
permit an early accommodation if one is required. When a student with a
disability does request accommodations, faculty may consult with the Learning
Needs and Evaluation Center for assistance in providing needed services.
Please appreciate that some students with disabilities may be qualified for
special support but choose not to seek accommodation.  
Your efforts as an instructor need not produce the identical result or level
of achievement for the student with a disability and the student without a
disability, but those efforts must afford persons with disabilities equal
opportunity to obtain the same result or achievement in the most integrated
setting possible. Alternative Procedures  
The list of alternatives leading to reasonable accommodations is unlimited.
The following pages provide suggestions on accommodations which can be made
for various disabilities. These procedures and suggestions for reasonable
accommodation are not all-inclusive. The Learning Needs and Evaluation Center
(243-5180) can provide additional ways to address specific disabilities and/or
situations. Also, if special arrangements are required contact your schools
associate/assistant dean (see Points of Contact.)

[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Blind/Visually Impaired**  
Many students who are legally blind have some percentage of measurable vision.
Large print books, text magnifiers, audio taped texts, note takers and taped
lecturers are some of the aids that visually impaired students may use for
assistance. Printing papers in larger fonts is another way to accommodate for
the limited vision. Blind students may use many of the same assistive devices
as vision impaired students but rely solely on audio or taactile devices to
receive information. Talking calculators and computers, reading machines, and
Braille machines are also used by blind students.  
When lecturing to a class in which a blind students is enrolled, remember to
read any information that you write on the board and try to refer to students
by name as you call on them so that the blind student is aware of who is
participating in class.  
Blind students often need adaptation of testing arrangements. Allowing the
student to take the test in a private room with a reader is one form of
accommodation. Providing a take home test on a computer disk, if the student
has a computer with voice output, is another way to accommodate the student.
When possible, it is best to keep the testing conditions as close to those
experienced by other classmates as possible to make comparison of test grades
more accurate and to prevent feelings of segregation.  
Blind students may use guide dogs to assist them with various tasks. The dogs
are extremely well trained and should not disrupt your class. The dogs are
working at all times and are welcome everyplace on Grounds.

**Additional suggestions for accommodating blind or students with visual
impairments:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Provide seating in the front of the classroom.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Not all students who are visually impaired know
braille. Although some may take Braille notes in class, the majority will use
a tape recorder.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Allow tape recorders in the classroom. In the
event that you are planning to publish your lecture notes and are worried
about having the lectures taped, you can have the student sign a release form
agreeing not to release the tapes or otherwise hinder your attempts to
copyright the lectures. See Appendix B for a sample form.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Items written on the blackboard or overhead
transparencies should also be stated orally or xeroxed and sent to LNEC.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Provide assistance interpreting materials which
are represented graphically or pictorially (or seek assistance of the Learning
Needs and Evaluation Center for this service).  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Students may use taped textbooks which they
obtain through the national organization, Recording for the Blind. A minimum
of two months' order time is normally necessary. You can help by making
textbook selections early.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Students may ask for assistance in locating a
volunteer note taker in class. Notes can later be used in conjunction with a
reader service and tapes of classroom discussion. Please preserve the
confidentiality of the student by asking the class to contact the LNEC if
interested in providing copies of their notes.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Since larger fonts produce longer papers,
designate word limits instead of page limits to establish a uniform standard
for all students when assigning papers.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Deaf or Hearing Impaired Students**  
Hearing loss manifests itself in varying degrees in individuals with hearing
impairments. The degree of hearing loss will determine the accommodation
needed in the classroom. Not all students who are deaf or hearing impaired can
lip read well enough to keep up with the discussion in a classroom or a
complicated lecture. At best, a deaf person can read approximately 30% of what
is being said.  
Some students may communicate through ASL (American Sign Language). The
grammar used in ASL is different from English grammar; thus, students may make
errors in written English resulting from grammatical differences in the
structure of the two languages. You should be aware that these mistakes are
not related to the students intelligence and should assist the students trying
to master written and spoken English.  
Some students will use an ASL interpreter in the classroom. There is a lag
time between what is being said in class and the deaf student receiving the
information. The students comments in the class may be delayed due to the time
taken to interpret the information. You can assist the interpreter by
encouraging one person to speak at a time. When talking through an
interpreter, address your comments to the student. Meetings with the deaf
student and the interpreter are encouraged to establish the most effective way
for the deaf person to receive and communicate information. In classes with
specialized vocabulary, it is useful to provide these to the student and the
interpreter ahead of time so the information is accurately conveyed. If an
interpreter is needed, contact the LNEC at 243-5180.

**Additional suggestions for accommodating deaf students or students with
hearing impairments:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Provide front row seating.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Look at the class when you are speaking.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Avoid standing with your back to a window or
other light source. The glare from behind you can make it difficult to read
lips and other facial expressions.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Avoid pacing.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Repeat questions or comments made by other
students/persons in the classroom before answering.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | A written sheet of "new" terms is helpful.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Use visual aids when possible.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Avoid oral testing.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Because the student wears a hearing aid it is not
necessarily true that he or she can discern the spoken word.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Most people who are deaf who do not speak choose
not to because they feel their speech will not be understood.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | As with other disabilities, a note taker may be
requested. It is nearly impossible for the person to take notes and speech
read or watch an interpreter simultaneously.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Mobility/Coordination Impaired**  
Access to classroom facilities is one of the major problems faced by students
with mobility impairments. Many of the buildings on Grounds have been made
accessible but there are still some that are inaccessible. When a class is
scheduled for an inaccessible room and a student who uses a wheelchair or who
has limited mobility is scheduled to take that class, it will be moved to an
accessible location. Contact the Coordinator of Services for Persons with
Disabilities to request any modifications to accommodate a student.  
Given the terrain of UVA and the distance between some of the buildings, some
students may have to take a circuitous route in order to get between classes.
Consequently, a student with a mobility impairment may be chronically late. It
is appropriate and helpful to talk to the student about the situation and seek
solutions together. It may be necessary to move the class closer to the
student's previous class so that she/he can be on time.  
If your office is in an inaccessible location and a student with a mobility
impairment would like an appointment, it will be necessary to find an
alternate, private location that is accessible to the student.

**Additional suggestions for accommodating students with mobility
impairments:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Provide a space among the desks for a wheelchair,
if necessary.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Provide advance notice if class activity will be
held elsewhere. If the assigned area has restricted accessibility, it requires
the relocation of the class activity to an accessible site.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | If the student has limited use of his/her hands,
providing a written list of terms is helpful.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | A student with limited hand function may also
need assistance in test taking and/or extended time limits. Prior to
examinations, contact the LNEC to make appropriate arrangements for students
with limited motor control.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | A note taker may be requested by students with
limited motor control.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Specific Learning Disabilities (SLDs)**  
This is one of the most common disabilities faced by students at the
Universality. Dyslexia, developmental aphasia, dysgraphia, expressive
dysphasia, aural receptive dysphasia, and sequential memory disorder are types
of SLDs. Although the processes by which a student learns may be disrupted by
their disability, their capacity to learn remains intact. A person with a
specific learning disability is often of above average intelligence but has
difficulty processing information due to neurologically based sensory and
motor dysperceptions. For example, some students may be extremely good at
written assignments but experience failure in oral examinations due to
difficulties processing oral information.  
If you notice a student who performs exceptionally well in class yet
consistently underperforms on exams or quizzes, you may want to refer them to
the LNEC for testing. Many students are first diagnosed with learning
disabilities in college when time pressures and other factors create new work
environments. Other students may have been diagnosed with an SLD at a young
age and may have spent a lot of time in classes learning how to cope with
their disability. Consequently, skills such as research or essay writing may
not have been developed before coming to college. Referring the student to the
Writing Center can help them learn to be better writers.  
The Learning Needs and Evaluation Center works with students to develop
accommodations that will help them achieve success in their academic work.
Accommodations include but are not limited to extended time on tests, note
takers in class, reading texts onto tape, permission to use word processors
for in class assignments, transcribers, and tutors. Professors are not
expected to alter the requirements or the standards for their courses.
However, a traditional manner of testing may be an ineffective way to test the
knowledge of a student with a SLD. It is important to remember that students
with learning disabilities may fail a test even though they know the
information; they flunk the testing process rather than the subject itself.
Finding alternate formats that satisfy your requirements yet allow the student
to express their knowledge is the ideal solution to this problem.

**Additional Points to Remember when teaching students with SLDs:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | The student with a specific learning disability
has met the same admission requirements as any University student in the same
degree program.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | A student's needs often result from impaired
information processing. He/she typically has trouble taking information in
through the senses and interpreting or interrelating that information in a
given time frame.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Some are unable to communicate effectively
through printing or cursive writing (dysgraphia). Oral examinations and
reports are more valid evaluations of their learning.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Others are, for all practical purposes, "lecture
deaf" (aural receptive dysphasia) and adopt techniques such as taping lectures
and/or requesting note takers.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Some have difficulty with sequential memory tasks
involving letters (spelling), numbers (mathematics), and following step-by-
step instructions.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | The majority spend inordinate amounts of time on
their assignments, depriving themselves of sufficient sleep.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Chronic Health Impairments**  
Chronic health impairments include cystic fibrosis, diabetes, sickle cell
anemia, cancers, AIDS, hemophilia, seizure disorders, muscular dystrophy,
rheumatoid arthritis and many others. At times these diseases can have acute
phases requiring bed rest or hospitalization. Absenteeism, associated with the
disability, needs to be accepted and schedules for requirements may need
adjustment. Many students with chronic illnesses tire easily, suffer from the
side effects of the medication they take, and have difficulty maintaining a
consistent schedule. Some students who require attendant care must rely on the
promptness of their attendants in getting them to class. If you observe
sporadic attendance or performance, meeting with the student may be necessary
to isolate the problem and possible solutions. It is important to establish a
procedure for the student to communicate with you when they must miss class
due to their illness.

**Additional Points to Remember when teaching students with chronic
illnesses:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) |  Late completion of selected assignments or
courses may be necessitated.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Scribes, class notes, or taped lectures may be
necessary.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Occasional use of wheelchairs may be necessary.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Medications may change and create changes in
behavior.  
  
First aid for seizure disorders is basically very simple, and is designed to
protect the safety of the person until the seizure stops naturally by itself.

**These are the key things to remember:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) |  Look for medical identification.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Protect from nearby hazards.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Loosen ties or shirt collars.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Place folded jacket under head.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Don't restrain.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Don't put anything into the mouth.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Don't try to hold tongue. It can't be swallowed.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Don't give liquids during or just after seizure.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Turn on side to keep airway clear.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Reassure the person when consciousness returns.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Don't use artificial respiration unless breathing
is absent after muscle jerks subside, or unless water has been inhaled.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Call an ambulance only if seizure is prolonged or
another one starts soon after the first.

**Emotional Illness**  
Emotional illnesses such as clinical depression, bipolar illness,
schizophrenia, or eating disorders can cause difficulties for the student in
establishing and maintaining social relations. The severity of the emotional
illness varies from case to case as does the manifestation of the symptoms of
the disease. Some students become very withdrawn, miss classes, forget
deadlines or assignments during  "down" cycles of their illness. Do not make
assumptions about the students abilities based on complications they
experience due to their illness. Even though many of these illnesses are
"invisible", their effects on the lives of students can be profound. Try to
talk with the student to establish a timeline for completing work that is
achievable given the obstacles faced by the student. If you have any questions
about working with a student with an emotional illness, do not hesitate to
contact the Counseling Center or Mental Health for assistance.

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Whether the illness is transitory, genetic, or
prolonged, these students need special consideration.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Refer the student to the Counseling Center,
Student Health, and/or LNEC. (See Points of Contact, inside back cover).  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Reasonable allowance should be made for
unpredictable absence.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Confer with 504 network personnel, especially
your school's associate/assistant dean in determining which accommodations
meet the requirements of your course and the needs of the student.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Arrested Drug or Alcohol Abuse**  
The problems faced by students who are recovering from alcoholism or drug
abuse can be similar to those faced by students with emotional illnesses.

**Some special considerations follow:**

  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Thinking, especially spontaneous responses, may
be distorted.  
---|---|---  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | There may be difficulties with memory and the
student may appear distractible and/or disorganized.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | These students may be reticent to speak in
classes.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | The students may become quite dependent, if so
encouraged.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Reasonable allowance should be made for
unpredictable absence.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | The student may fall behind in assigned work and
need extensions. They are mastering a new way of living and put great energy
into that job.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) | Timed conditions can be unmanageable.  
  | ![](images/bullet.gif) |  Word processing can help with the organization
of material.  
  
[[Back to Contents](ada-fac.html)]  
  
**Process for Appealing Recommended Accommodations**  
In the event that an accommodation recommended by the LNEC is not appropriate
for your course, please use the following appeals process.

  | 1. | The faculty member should write to the Disability Coordinator for his
or her school and outline the reasons that the recommended accommodation is
being challenged. (see inside back cover for this list)  
---|---|---  
  | 2. | The Disability Coordinator for the specific school will attempt to
resolve the issue.  
  | 3. | If the Disability Coordinator for the School is not able to resolve
the issue, he or she will contact the Learning Needs and Evaluation Center.
Only the disability Coordinator from the Individual Schools, the Director of
the LNEC, and the Compliance Officer can access documentation of the student's
disability without explicit permission from the student.  
  | 4. | The Director of the LNEC will attempt to resolve the issue.

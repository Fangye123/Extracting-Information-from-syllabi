## Course Description

This course introduces students to the processes and institutional contexts of
political competition in the United States. It places primary emphasis on
institutions (e.g., the Constitution, the Congress, the Presidency, the
Judiciary, the bureaucracy), modes of competition (e.g., elections,
policymaking, direct action), and mechanisms of interest aggregation (e.g.,
political parties, interest groups, the mass media, public opinion).

In regular sections of this class, the instructor seeks to provide students
the knowledge they need in order to become active, involved citizens. In the
Honors section, the instructor seeks additionally to introduce students to the
critical, scholarly literature on American politics and government, in order
to prepare them better for leadership roles in society.

To that end, we will examine and discuss a traditional introductory college-
level text on American politics and government _plus_ the contents of two
scholarly works on the subject. All students will read every other students
review plus, if available, a published critical review, so that by the end of
the semester we will all have been exposed to the ideas in 40 or so works.

Most weeks are divided into two sections. In our Monday seminars, we will
discuss course readings assigned for that week. Students are expected to have
read the assigned materials from the main text and to be prepared to discuss
their contents. These are _seminar_ sessions, not lecture sessions. Our
purpose is to discuss the readings critically, not to sit passively while the
instructor fills our heads with dry facts.

On most Wednesdays, we will discuss student essays of major works on American
politics and government, as described below. Early in the semester, however,
we will focus solely on the main text, so that students will have time to
prepare their essays.

These essays will review the contents of books, cleared in advance with the
instructor, and their review in _The American Political Science Review (APSR)_
or some other scholarly journal. The _APSR_ is available in the stacks of Bird
Library, or online at [ http://www.jstor.org/](http://www.jstor.org/). The
JSTOR site is proprietary and inaccessible unless you use a syr.edu account.
You may access it using a commercial internet service provider by setting your
browser's proxy server to the library proxy. See [
http://libwww.syr.edu/lis/proxy/index.html](http://libwww.syr.edu/lis/proxy/index.html)
for instructions.

Review essays should assess the arguments of both the book author and the
author of the published review. Do their arguments cohere logically? Do their
judgments follow from the evidence they present? Do they consider all the
relevant evidence, etc. Your essays will be graded on these same criteria,
except that the fullness of your review, your writing abilities, and the care
you have taken in crafting your essays will also be considered.

Each student will prepare her essay as a web page, which should be available
by the class session prior to the session during which it will be discussed.
At that prior class session, students will also distribute photocopies of the
_APSR_ (or other journal) review. On this submission, students will clearly
identify the URL for the web page where her review essay can be found. _All
students are expected to read every other student's essay and the
corresponding published review_. Students should come to class prepared to
discuss their contents.

Students who do not already know how to author web pages should consult
Computer and Media Services' instructions at [
http://cms.syr.edu/web/](http://cms.syr.edu/web/). SUNY Buffalo maintains an
excellent set of links to [ primers about authoring web
pages](http://www.cs.buffalo.edu/pub/WWW/other/html.html).

## Text

One text, noted below, has been been assigned for this course. Additional
readings may be placed on reserve at Bird Library or distributed in class, as
appropriate.

  * Bruce Miroff, Raymond Seidelman, and Todd Swanstrom, _The Democratic Debate: An Introduction to American Politics_. 2d ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1998. 
This is a standard college-level introductory text, in that it covers all the
typical topics for a course like this one. It should be eventually be
available at the Orange Student Bookstore in Marshall Square.

## Grading Criteria

Fifty percent of final grades will be assigned on the basis of performance on
two of three examinations. The lowest of these three grades will be dropped.
On the last regular class day, April 30, the instructor will announce the
names of students who need not take the third examination, as they will
receive an A grade no matter their performance on that examination. The
instructor considers this a just reward for the demonstration of excellence.
It is not necessarily the case that all students required to take the third
examination will not receive an A grade. Often. a student's strong performance
on the final examination frees her from the albatross of a poor grade earlier
in the semester. Because the instructor drops the lowest grade, _there will be
**no** make-up examinations_. Students who fail to appear for an examination,
for whatever reason -- legitimate or otherwise -- will receive a _zero_ grade.

Review essays will count for 30% of final grades. The remaining 20% will be
assessed on the basis of attendance and the quantity and quality of
participation in seminar.

HIEU 100, SCT. A INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR Mr. Robert Geraci


    "Siberia in Russian History and Culture"
  

 Although often thought of as a useless and uninhabitable wasteland, Siberia 
  has had an enormous impact on Russian civilization in both concrete and abstract 
  ways. In this seminar, we will examine many of the roles this eastern region 
  has played from the time of its conquest by Russia to the present. Topics will 
  include: Siberia as a place of exile and imprisonment; Russian views of Siberian 
  native peoples and cultures; Siberia as frontier of Russian settlement and land 
  of opportunity; the region's natural resources, technological change, and Siberia's 
  role in ecological-environmental movements; and Siberian motifs in film and 
  literature.
 The seminar is intended to acquaint students with the study of history: the 
  questions historians ask, how they think, and the types of sources they can 
  use to find answers. The seminar requires no prior knowledge of Russian history 
  or culture, and will serve as an introduction to the subject. Many of the readings 
  will be primary sources: novels, short stories, government documents, memoirs, 
  ethnographic literature, films, and so on. Students will be expected to read 
  from 150 to 200 pages per week. Participation in class discussions will account 
  for 40% of the course grade. Short, informal essays of a page or less may be 
  assigned to stimulate discussion. In addition, each student will turn in two 
  more formal and carefully written papers of 5-7 pages each on the readings. 
  Each of these will account for 30% of the semester grade. There are no examinations.
 Partial reading list:

Fedor Dostoevsky, The House of 
    the Dead
Nikolai Leskov, On the Edge of 
    the World
Vladimir Korolenko, short stories 
Drawing Shadows to Stone: The Photography 
    of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, 1897-
 1902
Yevgenii Yevtushenko, Bratsk Station 
    (excerpts)
Bruce Grant, In the Soviet House 
    of Culture: A Century of Perestroikas
Valentin Rasputin, Farewell to 
    Matyora
Dmitri Stonov, In the Past Night: 
    The Siberian Stories (excerpts)
Alexander Solzhenitsyn, The Gulag 
    Archipelago (excerpts)
Olga Kharitidi, Entering the Circle:

 Russian Psychiatrist
 Films will likely include "Dersu Uzala" and "Urga (Close to Eden)."

HIEU 100, SCT. B INTRODUCTORY SEMINAR Mr. Paul Halliday


    "Elizabeth and her England"
  

 Elizabeth is hot! Films, novels, even management gurus have explored and exploited 
  her. This course will examine the queen and the person behind the label "Gloriana". 
  Each week will take us into a different aspect of Elizabeth and the Elizabethans: 
  politics, religious controversy, diplomatic and military struggles, social history, 
  and the history of art and literature. In addition to reading historical works, 
  we will look at paintings, music, poems, speeches, and plays from her era. The 
  latter part of the course will examine why Elizabeth is still so interesting 
  to us, how various images of her have been made and used in fiction and film, 
  and what, as historians, we should make of these images.
 Assigned books may include:

Susan Frye, Elizabeth I: The Competition 
    for Representation
Garrett Mattingly, The Armada
Maria Perry, The Word of a Prince
Julia Walker, Dissing Elizabeth
D. M. Palliser, The Age of Elizabeth
Christopher Haigh, Elizabeth I

The course will conclude with at least one novel and one or more films or operas. 
  We will also visit the Special Collections room in Alderman Library to examine 
  original materials from Elizabeth's reign. Students will be asked to write a 
  paper using these materials.
 As a small seminar, students will be expected to engage the material actively 
  and to be ready to challenge one another in discussion. Readings will average 
  200 pp. per week. All students will make presentations in class. Two papers 
  (8-10 pp.) will be required. This course will fulfill the second writing requirement.
 
HIEU 202 WESTERN CIVILIZATION SINCE 1600 Mr. Alon Confino
 This course is a survey of the history of Europe since the beginning of the 
  seventeenth century. Among the themes that will be explored are the enlightenment 
  and the development of the concept of human rights, the rise of the nation-state, 
  the revolution in science and technology, the expansion of the European power 
  overseas, the secularization of society, modern revolutions and ideologies (the 
  French and the Russian Revolutions, liberalism, communism, fascism), and everyday 
  life in early modern and modern Europe.
 This is an introductory course that assumes no prior knowledge in European 
  history. Students will attend lectures two times a week as well as a discussion 
  section. Course requirements will include a midterm, a final examination, a 
  short (5-7 page) essay, and conscientious participation in discussion sections.

HIEU 204 ROMAN REPUBLIC AND EMPIRE Ms. Elizabeth Meyer
 A survey of the political, social, and institutional growth of the Roman Republic, 
  with close attention given to its downfall and replacement by an imperial form 
  of government; and the subsequent history of that imperial form of government, 
  and of social and economic life during the Roman Empire, up to its own decline 
  and fall. Readings of ca. 120 pages a week; midterm, final, one seven-page paper.
Readings will be drawn from the following:

 Sinnegan and Boak, A History of 
    Rome (text)
 Plutarch, Makers of Rome
 Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars
 Tacitus, Annals of Imperial Rome
 Cicero, Selected Political Speeches
 Apuleius, The Golden Ass
 R. MacMullen, Roman Social Relations
 and a xerox packet

HIEU 208 MODERN EUROPE Mr. Lenard Berlanstein
 This course is intended for students who have not had any or much modern European 
  history. The aim of the course is to introduce students to the great issues 
  of modern European history since the era of Napoleon, such as the Industrial 
  Revolution, nationalism, socialism, the origins of World War I, the fascist 
  regimes, the Holocaust, post-World War II democracy, etc. The instructor will 
  make a special effort to bring women and gender into the history of modern western 
  civilization. The geographical emphasis will be on Western Europe though developments 
  in Eastern Europe will not be neglected.
 The class has two fifty-minute lectures a week and a discussion section. Students 
  must enroll in both parts.
 The readings will consist of a textbook and four or five more specialized 
  books. Students will be asked to read about 100-120 pages a week. There will 
  be a mid-term, a final exam, and two five-page papers.
 
HIEU 212 THE EMERGENCE OF MODERN BRITAIN, 1688-2000 Mr. Richard Drayton
 This course surveys the history of Britain from the Glorious Revolution to 
  our own time. The making and remaking of this nation state over three hundred 
  years will be shown in its connections with the history of Europe, and the wider 
  story of the making of the modern world.
 We shall seek to understand the interactions of politics, war, art, science, 
  literature, music, sport, technology, commerce, industry, finance, emigration 
  and immigration, violence and civility. Handel and the Beatles, the discovery 
  of the steam engine and of the structure of DNA, the American Revolution and 
  the Second World War, Alexander Pope and Salman Rushdie, will all equally concern 
  us.
 Reading will average around 120 pages per week. Your grade will be based on 
  two midterms (each 20%) and one final (40%), and participation in section discussion 
  (20%). This is an introductory course for which there are no prerequisites, 
  and within which students from other departments are welcome.

HIEU 216 HISTORY OF RUSSIA SINCE 1917 Mr. Jeffrey Rossman
 An introductory survey of the history of Russia (broadly defined) from 1917 
  to the present. Briefly, our goal in the course is to explore the rise and fall 
  of a distinct form of civilization -- a polity, society, culture and empire 
  -- known as "Soviet Communism." Why did that "civilization" arise in Russia, 
  and what is "Russia" now that Soviet Communism is dead? To answer these questions, 
  lectures and readings will focus on the social and cultural as well as the political 
  history of the region. Major topics include: the revolutions of 1917; the Russian 
  Civil War; Lenin's New Economic Policy; Stalinism; the Great Fatherland War 
  and post-war reconstruction; the origins and phases of the Cold War; de-Stalinization 
  and the limits of reform (Khrushchev to Gorbachev); the crisis of late Communism 
  (the Brezhnev years); and finally, the disintegration of the USSR and the rise 
  of the Russian Federation (the Yeltsin Presidency).
 The course assumes no prior training in Russian history. Requirements include 
  active participation in weekly discussion sections, a midterm exam, a final 
  exam, and several short papers on required course readings. Readings (in English) 
  of about 150 pages per week will include primary and secondary sources. Possible 
  texts include: Lydia Chukovskaya, Sofia 
  Petrovna; Friedrich Engels and Karl Marx, The 
  Communist Manifesto; John Scott, Behind 
  the Urals; Alexander Solzhenitsyn, One 
  Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich; and John M. Thompson, A 
  Vision Unfulfilled.

 The course will cover major twists and turns of Polish history from the decline 
  of the Old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, through partitions and national risings 
  of the 19th century, the Second Republic, World War Two, Communist Poland and 
  recent systemic transformation. Its aim is to give basic understanding of the 
  complexity of Polish identity at the end of the 20th century.

 HIEU 321 MEDIEVAL AND RENAISSANCE ITALY Mr. Duane J. Osheim
 The object of this course is to investigate the political, social and cultural 
  history of Italy during the age of the Renaissance. The survey will begin with 
  a consideration of unique Italian political institutions and urban culture in 
  northern and central Italy; it will finish with a reconsideration of the end 
  of Italian cultural dominance and of the legacy of Renaissance culture. The 
  course will be a combination of lecture and discussion. Grades will be based

HIEU 334 SOCIETY AND THE SEXES IN EUROPE I Ms. Anne J. Schutte
 This course examines changing constructions of gender roles and their consequences--social, 
  economic, political, religious, cultural, psychological--for women and men from 
  late antiquity (4th century CE) through the sixteenth century, with particular 
  emphasis on the latter part of this period. The textbook is Bridenthal, Koonz 
  and Stuard (eds.), Becoming Visible: 
  Women in European History (3rd ed.). We shall analyze closely several 
  primary works selected from the following list:

 Augustine, Confessions
 Dhuoda, Handbook for William
 The Letters of Abelard and Heloise
 Gottfried van Strassburg, Tristan
 Christine de Pisan, Treasure of 
    the City of Ladies
 The Book of Margery Kempe
 Baldesar Castiglione, The Book 
    of the Courtier
 Benvenuto Cellini, Autobiography
 Teresa of Avila, Life
Articles by modern scholars complement general and primary source readings.

 Conducted mainly in the conversational mode, Society and the Sexes I provides 
  students with valuable experience in initiating and leading discussions. The 
  weekly reading load ranges between 150 and 200 pages. Several papers of different 
  types and lengths (enough to fulfill the Second Writing Requirement), one midterm, 
  and a final examination are required.
 Note: Students with no previous exposure to European history or literature 
  are encouraged to consult the instructor about the advisability of enrolling 
  in this course.
 HIEU 338 REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE, 1770-1814 Ms. Sophie Rosenfeld
 This course will examine the social, cultural, intellectual, and political 
  history of France from the end of the Old Regime through the Napoleonic Empire. 
  The origins, development, and outcome of the French Revolution will be our main 
  focus. Attention will also be given to the impact of events in France on other 
  western nations and to the legacy of the French Revolution in terms of such 
  modern concepts as human rights, nationalism, welfare, feminism, democracy, 
  and revolution itself. Throughout the course, we will emphasize the different 
  and often conflicting ways in which historians have interpreted the meaning 
  and consequences of this critical moment of upheaval. Class meetings will combine 
  lecture and discussion of weekly readings, including Darnton, The 
  Great Cat Massacre; Lefebvre, The 
  Coming of the French Revolution; Tocqueville, The 
  Old Regime and the French Revolution; Hufton, Women 
  and the Limits of Citizenship; and numerous primary sources, from revolutionary 
  festival programs to Al-Jabarti's chronicle of Napoleon in Egypt. The requirements 
  of the course are on one 4-page paper, one 8-page paper, a midterm exam, and 
  a final.

HIEU 342 MOBILIZING THE MASSES: PROPAGANDA IN THE MODERN AGE, Mr. Brian Kassof
 1914-1960 (crosslisted as MDST 345)
 One of the defining features of the twentieth century was the use of mass 
  propaganda by states and political interest groups. This course will examine 
  the ways in which various types of propaganda (including texts, images, and 
  sound) were used to mobilize populations in modern Europe, from the First World 
  War through the early Cold War. We will look at both the reasons behind the 
  increased use of mass propaganda techniques (the age of "total war," mass politics, 
  and ideological motivations), and how new technologies, such as film and radio, 
  were used in propaganda campaigns. Although the course will look at the use 
  of propaganda across Europe, particular attention will be given to the so-called 
  "propaganda states"--the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany. Familiarity with twentieth 
  century European History (HIEU 208 or 345) is useful, but not required. Students 
  without a background in European history may wish to contact the instructor 
  before the first class meeting.
 The format of this course will be a combination of lecture and discussion. 
  We will look at examples of propaganda from a number of genres, including texts, 
  film, music, and posters. Grades will be based on a mid-term, a final, several 
  short written assignments, and one 8-10 page research paper, as well as participation 
  in class discussions. Class readings will average about 100-150 pages a week--students 
  will also be expected to view several films outside of class.

HIEU 355 ENGLISH LEGAL HISTORY OF 1776 Mr. Paul Halliday
 This course surveys the history of English law from the medieval period to 
  the 18th century. During class meetings mixing lecture and discussion, we will 
  concentrate on how social and political forces transformed the major categories 
  of law: property, trespass, torts and contracts, corporations, family law, constitutional 
  and administrative law, and crime. Law will thus be understood as a variety 
  of social experience and as a manifestation of cultural change, not simply as 
  an autonomous realm of thought and practice. We will look at the evolution of 
  the jury, competition between jurisdictions, and the development of the legal 
  profession. We will conclude by examining the transmission and transformation 
  of English ideas and practices in America before the Revolution.
 Assigned books will include J. H. Baker, An 
  Introduction to English Legal History and Eileen Spring, Law, 
  Land, and Family. Much of our discussion will focus on notes, reports, 
  and yearbook entries of individual cases. All students will be expected to participate 
  in discussions of these documents. Readings will range from 100 to 300 pages 
  per week. Students will write two short essays (circa 5 pages) and take a mid-term 
  and a final exam.
 HIEU 361 REFORM AND REVOLUTION IN RUSSIA, 1855-1917 Mr. Robert Geraci
 This course will explore political, social, and economic upheaval in Russia 
  from the end of the Crimean War to World War I and the revolutions of February 
  and October 1917. Special focus will be on the "Great Reforms"; industrialization, 
  urbanization, and labor; the fate of the agricultural economy and peasantry; 
  the question of social identities and Russia's "missing middle class"; revolutionary 
  terrorism; and the 1905 revolution and the experiment in liberal politics.
 Secondary sources will include W. Bruce Lincoln, The 
  Great Reforms; Orlando Figes, A 
  People's Tragedy, The Russian Revolution, 1891-1924; Anna Geifman, Thou 
  Shalt Kill: Revolutionary Terrorism in Russia, 1894-1917. Primary 
  sources will include Olga Semyonova Tian-Shanskaia, Village 
  Life in Late Tsarist Russia; Victoria Bonnell, ed., The 
  Russian Worker; V. V. Shulgin, The 
  Years: Memoirs of a Member of the Russian Duma, 1906-1917, and some short 
  literary works.
 The format will be mostly lectures, though several classes will be devoted 
  to discussion of books. Grades will be based on a midterm, two short papers, 
  and a comprehensive final examination. At least one of the papers will require 
  students to interpret a memoir or literary source in light of the historical 
  events and processes discussed. There are no prerequisites for the course, although 
  previous experience in European or Russian history is helpful.
 HIEU 375 THE EVOLUTION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM, 1815-1954 Mr. Stephen A. 
  Schuker
 This course traces the evolution of great-power politics from the post-Napoleonic 
  peace settlement in 1815 to the Russo-American Cold War in the 1950s. Readings 
  and lectures will emphasize developments in the European state system in the 
  19th century, when Europe remained the locus of world power, and will expand 
  to include the United States, Japan, and other extra-European nations as those 
  nations gained weight in the international system. The course begins with discussion 
  of how demographic, agricultural, and industrial development influenced transnational 
  relationships. It then covers the systems of Metternich and Bismarck, the revolutions 
  of 1848 and role of nationalism in transforming the map of Europe, the significance 
  of the "Eastern Question," continental and overseas imperialism, the causes 
  and consequences of the two world wars, the Cold War between the Soviet Union 
  and the United States, and preliminary steps toward European recovery and economic 
  unity. Twentieth-century topics will accord due weight to the growing importance 
  of finance and economics in determining diplomatic outcomes, as well as to the 
  role of technology in changing the nature of warfare.
 The class will meet for one-and-one quarter hour lectures twice a week. Students 
  will be provided both with a basic reading list and with suggestions for further 
  reading on each topic. Students will be asked to write a short but polished 
  bibliographical essay on some major topic covered during the term, as well as 
  to take a three-hour final exam. An optional midterm will be offered if there 
  is sufficient student demand.
 There are no formal prerequisites, but familiarity with the basic outlines 
  of European, American, or world history in the nineteenth and twentieth century 
  will prove helpful.
 HIEU 380 ORIGINS OF CONTEMPORARY THOUGHT Mr. Allan Megill
 The course examines some important topics in intellectual history from Darwin's 
  Origin of Species (1859) onward. 
  The course does not claim to survey the intellectual history of the period in 
  question. Instead it focuses on a few important themes--themes that I take to 
  be important for understanding the historical background to current theoretical 
  reflection. The themes that we shall consider include: (1) the decline of belief 
  in the notion of a single, progressive historical process, a notion that dominated 
  much of nineteenth-century thought; (2) the rise of the notion of a pre-rational 
  or irrational unconscious, which paralleled doubts concerning the rational ordering 
  of the world in general; (3) the emergence of "aestheticism" and of "crisis 
  thought"; and (4) the emergence of new views of interpretation and of science. 
  The overall theme is the presence of, and challenges to, the notion that there 
  is a rationality embedded in the world.
 Reading (in order of use) includes: Charles Darwin, The 
  Origin of Species (Penguin), Friedrich Nietzsche, "The 
  Birth of Tragedy" and "The Genealogy of Morals", trans. Golffing (Doubleday), 
  Allan Megill, Prophets of Extremity: 
  Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, 
  Derrida (California), Nietzsche, The 
  Portable Nietzsche, ed. and trans. Kaufmann (Penguin), Sigmund Freud, 
  The Interpretation of Dreams 
  (Discus Avon), and Freud, Civilization 
  and Its Discontents (Norton). We shall do selections from Martin Heidegger, 
  Being and Time, trans. Joan 
  Stambaugh (State University of New York Press, 1996), and possibly from Thomas 
  S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific 
  Revolutions. There will be a small class packet, costing about $10.00, 
  and a few pages for you to photocopy on your own. Course 
  Requirements: weekly "think questions," midterm, synthesizing term paper, 
  final exam. The term paper and final carry heavy weight.
 HIEU 401, SCT. A HISTORY SEMINAR Mr. Bradford D. Whitener


    "Religion and Modernity: What to believe when the world keeps changing?"
  

 This class explores the various ways in which religious belief systems have 
  engaged with "Modernity." This engagement has often been viewed as a conflict 
  between Tradition and Progress, Truth and Relativism, Faith and Reason, Church 
  and State, Religion and Science, or Authority and Freedom. The spectrum of responses 
  to modern culture within religious communities since the Enlightenment and French 
  Revolution has ranged from the extreme of either adapting beliefs to meet the 
  needs of the present, to that of completely rejecting the present and its values. 
  The aim of this seminar is to probe the content of these conflicts using the 
  tools of the historian. Students should be prepared to choose a paper topic 
  that engages with some aspect of the Religion-Modernity relation.
 Students will be responsible for preparing one or two very short presentations 
  on common readings, choosing a seminar topic, preparing a bibliography, doing 
  the necessary research and presenting it before the class, and finally, submitting 
  a finished piece of historical research in the form of a 25-30 page paper. The 
  course will begin with four weeks of readings in the literatures pertaining 
  to Secularization, Religion and Science, Fundamentalism, and Ecumenicalism (200-300 
  pages per week for the first four weeks); these readings are intended to provide 
  students with an orientation to the major issues, literatures, and theoretical 
  approaches to the topic, thereby assisting students in formulating interesting 
  and feasible projects of their own. The topic should be one that is narrow enough 
  to be reasonably researched within the timeframe of the course; it should also 
  be conceived in such a way that it clearly fits within the current literatures 
  relevant to the topic Religion and Modernity. A successful paper will satisfy 
  the history seminar and second writing requirements.
 Students interested in this course are encouraged to contact me by email for 
  a detailed syllabus, a list of possible topic areas, and a bibliography.

 HIEU 401, SCT. B HISTORY SEMINAR Mr. H. C. Erik Midelfort


    "Protest and Propaganda, 1500-1800"
  

 This seminar examines and compares the popular literatures of Germany, France, 
  and England from the Reformation through the eighteenth century. Original pamphlets 
  form the core of the reading, providing examples of protest literature from 
  ordinary people and of propaganda from various kinds of institutional or establishment 
  authors. In effect, the course introduces one of the most characteristic forms 
  of expression in early modern Europe, the pamphlet, and asks what we can learn 
  about the societies and the cultural movements that tried to mobilize political, 
  religious, social, moral, and traditional sentiments for rapid change or, in 
  other cases, to block change. After a few weeks of common reading, students 
  will plunge into the riches of Alderman Library, using our pamphlet collections 
  to examine the culture, politics, and religion of Germany, France, or England. 
  Students who have adequate French or German will find ample opportunity to extend 
  their competence, but English pamphlets are also full of interest and will provide 
  plenty of research material for those whose linguistic abilities are restricted.
 Each student will compose a major research paper of 20-30 pages, and the class 
  will discuss each one in detail. Immersion in such popular sources brings a 
  new vividness and delight to historical research.
 Prerequisites:
Like other history seminars, this one presupposes a basic general survey knowledge 
  of European history, such as is provided by Western Civilization or other courses 
  on the period 1500-1800.
 Schedule:
This course meets once a week and requires close attention in order to finish 
  a major research paper on time.
 Common Reading:

Miriam Usher Chrisman, Conflicting 
    Visions of Reform: German Lay Propaganda Pamphlets, 1519-1530
David Potter, ed. and tr., The 
    French Wars of Religion: Selected Documents

HIEU 401, SCT. C HISTORY SEMINAR Mr. Thomas Laub


    "State and Society in Nazi Germany" 
  

 Although it perished in flames over fifty years ago, Hitler's Third Reich 
  continues to interest professional historians and the general public. Television 
  networks and newspapers carry stories about Nazi gold and recount how victims 
  of the Third Reich are taking legal action against German corporations in American 
  courts. The past may once again be prologue as war crimes are being committed 
  by a variety of groups in the former Yugoslavia. This course attempts to strip 
  away rhetoric and grapple with one of the fundamental issues of Nazi Germany 
  -- the relationship between Nazi state and the German people.
 In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, scholars and the general 
  public blamed war crimes on a few Nazi fanatics and criminal organizations such 
  as the SS. They absolved the average German of responsibility for most of the 
  unsavory policies of the Third Reich. Students will be encouraged to move beyond 
  this simplistic explanation and explore connections between high and low politics. 
  How did individuals and groups interact with the Nazi regime? Did they share 
  common goals? How did the Nazi regime and a particular social group accommodate 
  each other? How did individuals and groups express dissent, and did their opposition 
  have an impact on the regime?
 Assigned readings are designed to expose students to a variety of methodological 
  approaches and scholarly debates. They are intended to provoke class discussion 
  and help students focus their own ideas. Readings for weeks four through six 
  are intentionally short to allow students time to prepare a research topic. 
  The book review due on the eighth week of class should discuss a monograph that 
  is central to each student's paper topic and discuss many of the issues that 
  his or her paper will have to confront. It should be viewed as a step in the 
  production of the final paper rather than a separate assignment. Oral presentations 
  should be regarded in a similar light and are intended to serve as a forum that 
  students can use to exchange ideas and help each other. A twenty-five page paper 
  that employs standard footnoting and bibliographical citation methods will be 
  due at the final class meeting.

    "Contact: European Encounter with the Outside World, 1450-1800" 
  

 From the Portuguese voyages around Africa to India, through Columbus' discovery 
  of the New World to Cook's explorations in the Pacific, for Europeans the period 
  1450-1800 was a time of great expansion, with their horizons widening to include 
  contact with almost every other culture in the world. The relationship between 
  Europe and the non-European cultures varied widely over this period, from exploration 
  to conquest, incorporating social, cultural, religious, and political aspects. 
  In addition to the efforts of explorers, conquerors, missionaries and colonists 
  to under the peoples they encountered, information and myths about non-European 
  cultures had a profound impact on European culture and thought, influencing 
  the course of European philosophy, religion, political science, biology, linguistics, 
  and the nascent field of anthropology. Whether they went abroad in the world 
  like Hernan Cortes and Captain John Smith or stayed at home like William Shakespeare 
  and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Europeans could not escape having their world views 
  changed dramatically by this contact.
 This class is designed to help students write a 25-page paper of original 
  research on some aspect of European encounters with other cultures. During the 
  first few weeks, students will become acquainted with the methods used to analyze 
  contact between cultures by reading and discussing the best historical work 
  in the field. Then students will choose their own topics for research, studying 
  either an example of European encounter with a non-European culture or some 
  topic on the issue of the impact of non-European cultures on European culture 
  and society. To help with the process of writing, rough drafts will be presented 
  to the class for suggestions and comments before the final draft is due. This 
  course fulfills the Second Writing Requirement, and no knowledge of foreign 
  languages if required.
 Course readings will include part or all of either Christopher Columbus' Journals 
  and Other Documents or Hernan Cortes' Letters 
  from Mexico, Tzvetan Todorov's The 
  Conquest of America: The Question of the Other, and/or Inga Clendinnen's 
  Ambivalent Conquests: Maya and Spaniard 
  in Yucatan, 1517-1570, P. J. Marshall and Glyndwr Williams' The 
  Great Map of Mankind: British Perceptions of the World in the Age of Enlightenment, 
  and 2-3 scholarly articles, such as Richard Drayton's "Knowledge and Empire," 
  and J. B. Harley, "Maps, Knowledge, and Power."
 HIEU 404 INDEPENDENT STUDY IN EUROPEAN HISTORY Staff
 In exceptional circumstances and with the permission of a faculty member any 
  student may undertake a rigorous program of independent study designed to explore 
  a subject not currently being taught or to expand upon regular offerings. Independent 
  Study projects may not be used to replace regularly scheduled classes. Enrollment 
  is open to majors or non-majors.
 HIEU 513 MEDIEVAL FRANCE Mr. Everett U. Crosby
 A documentary history of the medieval origins of modern France based on a 
  study of selected texts. A variety of sources dealing with kingship, ecclesiastical 
  power, university life and culture, cathedral architecture, language and literature, 
  and the city of Paris, will be read and discussed in order to show how medieval 
  Francia was assembled out of diverse parts, and what the significant steps were 
  which led to the formation of the nation state.
 There will be required one term paper of 10-15 pages on a topic related to 
  the material of the course, and a final examination.
 Students who join this course should have a reading knowledge of French.

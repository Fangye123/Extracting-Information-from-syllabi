Housing policy, like welfare, health, education, and other social policy
arenas, is undergoing a period of fundamental reexamination and debate. Not
only are the objectives and implementation of housing policy at issue, the
very need for housing policy is itself in question. This course is designed to
provide the background necessary to become informed participants in this
debate over the future of U.S. housing policy and to develop conceptual tools
necessary to formulate and implement housing policy.  


The course introduces key concepts and institutions pertaining to housing
policy. It emphasizes the economic, institutional, and political forces that
influence the production, distribution, maintenance, and location of housing.
The first part of the course covers the overarching context for U.S. housing
policy, including housing market dynamics, housing finance, taxation, and
racial discrimination. The second part traces the evolution of federal, state
and local housing programs, with emphasis given to low-income rental housing.
The course will conclude with a field trip to a community development
corporation and a discussion on homeownership and housing policy.  


The course will involve a combination of lectures, class discussion, videos,
and a field trip. It is absolutely essential to have read the required
readings before each class session. All students must write one to two pages
every week on the key issues raised in the required readings. These discussion
papers will not be graded individually but will contribute to the class
participation grade.  


In addition to the weekly discussion papers, students will complete three
assignments: an analysis of an urban housing market, an in-class mid-term
exam, and a take-home final exam.  
  **Course Requirements**  

1\. Prompt class attendance. Class begins at 5:50 sharp.

2\. Completion of the assigned readings and active class discussion.

3\. Submission of weekly discussion papers.

4\. Completion of Housing Market Analysis Assignment.

5\. Completion of the in-class exam.

6\. Completion of a a take-home final exam.  


Final grades will be based on the following:  


Class Participation (including

weekly discussion papers) 25%

Housing Market Analysis 20%

In-Class Exam 25%

Final Exam/Term Paper 30%  


_Late Assignments:_ Assignments submitted more than one week after the due
date will be penalized by one full grade (e.g., from B+ to C+).  


_Incompletes:_ Incompletes can be given only if an "incomplete" form is filled
out and signed by me at least two sessions prior to the final exam.  


_Field Trip_ : On December 8, the class will travel to East Harlem and visit
Hope Communities, one of New York's oldest and largest CDCs, and meet with
staff engaged in housing development and other activities. The trip will go
from 10 AM to 12 noon, so please plan your schedule accordingly. Details will
be announced later (including lunch at a local restaurant).  
    
  **Required Texts**  

One text is required for the course: **G. Thomas Kingsley and Margery Austin
Turner, eds. _Housing Markets and Residential Mobility_ Washington, DC: The
Urban Institute, 1994).** This text, a bound xerox copy, is being sold to
Housing Policy students for $12 by special arrangement with the publisher. The

  **Other Readings**

at the first session. All required readings for the rest of the semester,
except for the Kinglsey and Turner book and hand-outs, are available for
purchase at Unique Copy Center at 74 Fifth Ave. Copies of these readings are

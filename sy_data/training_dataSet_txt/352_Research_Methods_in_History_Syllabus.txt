PURPOSE AND SCOPE:
This course is an introduction to
research methods for students in the humanities. Thesis writers, students
interested in independent research projects or graduate school will benefit
from the exercises and lessons covered in this course. Students will choose
their own questions or problems and apply to them the objectives and exercises
outlined here. The course will require meticulous and time-consuming attention
to detail, but will allow students a break from the more traditional thematic
structure of courses and paper-writing at Holy Cross. At least two of our
class meetings will be on-site visits to libraries and archives, and it
might be necessary during the term to add one or two additional sessions
to discuss the reports. I will provide introductions to the week's materials
and guide you through the search process. This course will not only make
you a more efficient researcher, cutting your search time in half, but
also bring to your attention the many and complex sources of materials
that undergraduates often are not aware of and fail to use in their research
projects.  A good portion of the course will be dedicating to learning
how to take advantage of electronic resources.
Class times will often be divided
into two halves: a presentation of the week's materials and challenges
and then a work session in students might separate to carry out individual
work or present and discuss their own work.
DETERMINATION OF GRADE AND REQUIREMENTS:
Half your grade will be determined
by your participation and attendance. Attendance is crucial in a once-a-week
format research seminar format.
The other half of your grade will
be based on the weekly (approximately 12) projects and exercises. These
will vary in weight according to the difficulty and time involved. The
final requirement for this course is a draft of your research paper that
reflects the course's lessons, and final drafts of some of the reports
assigned and revised during the term.
It is important for students to
remain in contact with me about their projects and consult with me individually
throughout the term.
Every week you must check the web
site for updates and information on assignments.
Students will submit their work via
email attachment and/or hardcopy but also post all work to the course's
network drive (K: drive)
Students must:


Dedicate at least seven hours a week
to their projects outside of class time, fifteen if your work is part of
an additional requirement (thesis, independent study, etc.)

Check their email once each day for feedback
and assignments

Submit their work in paper and email
attachment or K: drive

Drafts of the main abstract, bibliography,
outline, proposal, paper, and to other students via email

Read each other's work when requested
and be prepared to comment upon them

Submit work on time

Be prepared to present their work

Accumulate no more than one unexcused
absence

research question. This project may or may not be connected to other projects
such as theses, independent studies, etc. We will discuss these projects
in class, refine them and critique them, in the context of any relevant
debates or questions specific to student's projects. Students must bring
a 5 page proposal draft describing their project. This proposal must
include the following sections: Definition of the problem and question,
theoretical context, summary of the literature, research and sources, methodology.
They will also start work on an abstract of their project.

and will become familiar with the appropriate software options. Students
will begin a research log and outline that they will continue to develop
during the semester.

This session will be dedicated to
online searching for reference, secondary, and primary materials through
online methods. Students will write a report on the process and their findings.
This research and its continuation during the semester will result in a
working bibliography that has to be updated weekly on the K Drive and a

**What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?**

>The "community" that developed with the other participants  
>Being in a setting where interdisciplinary interests/activities were shared,
respected, and reinforced  
>Meeting other faculty that I probably wouldn't otherwise have encountered  
>The diversity of faculty participants  
>Opportunity to identify shared teaching and research interests and to develop
concrete plans for pursuing those  
>Information/experience with Foundation Center resources, additional library
resources, and Course Info  
>Stipend that will be used for a student to help with grading during fall
semester, freeing up a little time for me to pursue collaborative activities
emerging from the workshop  
>Computer upgrade (which will help me especially with putting courses on line)  
>The terrific job done by the workshop coordinator! :-)

  
**How could of the workshop have been improved?**

>Have structure set up to accommodate those who weren't in already-formed
groups from the beginning  
>Be sure speakers are prepared to focus on interaction with participants
rather than reading papers (and possibly providing a paper to read in advance
if the speaker has one so time could be spent in discussion)  
>Have final "social event" be a lunch (either at U.C. or University Club) the
final day (perhaps followed by afternoon discussion continued at the same
site, maybe with invited administrators present)  
>Encourage participation from "hard sciences"  
>Include more diversity in outside speakers (especially gender and
disciplinary background)

  
**Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?\**

 **>** Enhanced rather than changed (e.g., rejuvenated me, opened up new
opportunities)

  
**If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?**

 **>** YES! We identified a common interest and began working together early
on. We are establishing a U.S. Colloquy and are developing two proposals to
submit to ICE (one on course development and one on grant development). We
also have identified a small research project that several in our group plan
to pursue.

  
**Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?**

 **>** No. This would limit diversity among participants and unnecessarily
restrict thinking. One of the advantages of our workshop was the diversity
there, and I can't imagine a "theme" that would have drawn this kind of group.

  
**What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?**

 **>** With group of colleagues: Formation of new colloquy, submission of 2
ICE proposals, implementation of research project, possible sponsorship of
conference on spirituality and health (or specific aspect thereof)  
> Individual: Pursuit of new research area, development of proposals for
outside funding, putting course(s) on line for next year, participation in at
least one new interdisciplinary course

  
**Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?**

>I'd be willing to HELP, perhaps as a member of a planning committee.

  
**Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.**

>It was a great experience! I hope that there will be follow-though at various
institutional levels in support for interdisciplinary work.

**_Tom Hood, Professor of Sociology_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
The speakers provided interesting ideas to discuss and responded to questions
in a helpful fashion. The Courseinfo instruction was helpful to me.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

I felt that the group time was very useful for pre-formed groups, but somewhat
less useful for forming groups.

  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

There is more support here and across the country for interdisciplinary
research and teaching than there used to be. I need to make an effort to talk
to colleagues in other departments which I had not considered might share my
interests about some of my ideas.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
I was not a member of a preformed group.  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
I believe that a colloquy will form on Spirituality and Health and that a
research paper will be written.  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

Possibly, but I think that a broad focus enables diverse participation. I
would like to see a workshop that caught the interest of scientists and
humanists.  
Possibly Can we achieve population control so as not to exceed the earth's
carrying capacity?

  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

I foresee course offerings, a proposal for a center, a reasonable number of
individual and group research proposals, and lots of faculty contacts.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
With enough advance notice, Yes!  
  
  
  
**_Catherine Faver, Professor of Social Work_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
1\. Plenary speakers  
  
2\. small group working sessions through which the spirituality and health
people identified each other and began forming a colloquy  
  
3\. Courseinfo intro and library resources sessions  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
Perhaps obtain pre-workshop info from participants regarding the
computer/library/grants skills and then have several options during nuts and
bolts so people could focus on the areas they need the most.  
  
Also, in addition to statements from participants prior to the workshop, it
might be useful to have everyone simply list all their research/teaching
interests so that the coordinators (and perhaps participants) could anticipate
some areas in which working groups might form. It worked really well this year
but I wonder if people would always be able to "fill their dance card" (to
borrow Beauvais' metaphor) without changes to this year's procedure.  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

Yes, it helped me see how I could organize my classes to have a more
collaborative learning environment, and to me this is a very important
contribution to my professional growth.

Also, the formation of the spirituality and health group opens whole new
options for both teaching and research. Prior to the workshop I had done
teaching in this area, but I now think I will be much more involved in
research on this topic than I might have without the workshop, and there are
new collaborative teaching possibilities with this group as well.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
Not applicable  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
Yes, see above  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I have mixed feelings about this. I'll have to get back to you when I form an
opinion.  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

Collaborative teaching and research and a colloquy perhaps leading to a
conference, all from the spirituality and health group. In the short term, our
group will probably submit a proposal for course development to ICE by June
12. Later, we will probably go for foundation funding.

On animals and society, I will resubmit my course development proposal by June
collaborators on board (Beauvais Lyons for a guest lecture, Jo Lynn Cunningham
for help with service learning) along with my co-proposers John Nolt and John
New.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
No, I don't have the appropriate skills. Beauvais did a GREAT job.  
  
  
  
**_Kathy Jo Ellison, Associate Professor of Nursing_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

I said in the evaluation session that the most useful aspects to me were the
contacts with other faculty and knowledge of opportunities and resources at
UT.  
This may be an informal aspect but an important unexpected one I would like to
share - I feel I learned a lot about academic leadership. The ICE council
themselves have demonstrated excellent '"community leadership" in setting up
this workshop to foster interdisciplinary work at UT. The success of the ICE
council and their agenda benefits not only the humanities but all units on
campus and should continue to serve as a "model" of excellence in leadership.
Charlie Reynolds is visionary and one can learn a lot from his leadership. The
truly excellent academic leaders that were brought in as speakers taught me a
tremendous amount about academic leadership even when that wasn't their topic!
I believe this experience will help me be a better leader with the faculty I
work with in Nursing as well as help support of kind of academic climate that
UT needs to more forward with its goals as a University.

  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
For the type of group we had, it was the most incredibly well planned workshop
I have ever attended - just the right amount of structured and unstructured
time.  
One might say "it was a work of art!"  

The only thing I would have liked more of was discussions on teaching in an
interdisciplinary format. I have taught one interdisciplinary course in the
past and we struggled with how to keep from just coming in and doing "our
part". In other words, I think "the whole becoming more than the sum of the
parts" doesn't just happen but needs to be created.

  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

More of expanding my ideas of what and how to better accomplish these
activities at UT. Once again, I was confronted with how university politics as
well as state/national politics affect my goals in those areas! It helped me
to get more insight into UT and I felt challenged and perhaps more positive
that we can move the "soft" sciences forward here! I also got some teaching
ideas from several members related to collaborative teaching/learning and
group projects that will be most useful to me,

  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
Yes. The Spirituality and Health group that formed had many interesting
discussions. I think this group will form a colloquy and perhaps teach a
course together. I also think several smaller research projects may arise from
the group. You may already know but we are meeting again this Wednesday to
discuss  
possibilities! I wanted more input for my critical thinking project with Carol
Bean but didn't find anyone really interested - I felt since it was me alone
in the conference, I couldn't open it up to the whole group. I had one
discussion with Katherine Greenberg that was helpful and we may talk again
about it - so I did get some input!  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

I don't think one is specifically necessary - themes did arise from the group
that provided organization and you seemed to take that into account some with
selection of participants. Maybe just a focus on developing themes from who
applies...  
I think you should just stay more general and get into issues in/process of
interdisciplinary teaching and research. Some speakers did that and others
dealt with more the resources aspect - a good mix!

  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

Some are hard to quantify - I have a much better knowledge of opportunities at
UT that will help me in teaching and outreach. I feel more "a part" of UT - I
have many more contacts outside nursing and understand a little better how
things work and what many of the concerns are here. I believe the Spirituality
and Health group will achieve many of the goals of the workshop as stated
earlier. My contact with Carol Bean in Information Science was a result of the
workshop even though we did not submit a proposal there - we got together
because of the "ICE call for proposals" and did obtain funding for our pilot
work. We plan to submit a much larger grant next Spring so in a sense the
workshop was instrumental in that happening.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  

Beauvais, it would be hard for anyone to do it as well. You have the right
blend of skills to pull off such a great challenge. You had the perfect mix of
hands-on/hand-off and blend of humor and seriousness that made it work with
such a diverse group. I truly think much of the success of the workshop was
due to your expert leadership. I would recommend to the ICE council they find
a way to get you to do it again - for "enhanced pay!!"

  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  

I've rambled enough already. I do want to say thanks again to Beauvais and the
whole ICE council for a wonderful experience. It was the most enlightening 2
weeks I have spent in quite a long time!

  
  
**_Mariana Leal Ferreira, Assistant Professor of Anthropology_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

Getting faculty members to meet, share their projects and to interact closely
with each other. Also, finding out general information about UT from different
perspectives, including its great faculty and other valuable resources, fhas
made me feel very proud of being a faculty member here. I feel more excited
about my intellectual career in the long run at UT, because there are several
research opportunities out there, and the faculty are willing to do
collaborative work together. This has strengthened the current proposals I am
working on.

  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

I would have provided faculty that came without a preformed research group
with alternative things to do, other than meet with the established groups all
the time, or try to make connections among ourselves. These connections were
very important of course, but it would have been important to have, for
example, small sessions geared towards, say, proposal writing, facilitated by
somebody at the Office of Research, for example. Or some other activity, like
techniques for cooperative teaching, which everyone seemed most interested in.

  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  
  
Yes. I have gained much from conversations about collaborative/cooperative
teaching, which have enabled me to reconfigure my syllabus and classroom  
activities. This is why I said above we could have benefited from some
talk/workshop in teaching techniques. Also, because we discussed in detail the
Center of Excellence proposed by ICE, I feel more prepared to submit a major
NIH grant for diabetes research, involving a big research team. In terms of  
creativity, I have realized that many faculty from other depts. have a lot
more in common with my own work than colleagues in my own dept. This is
exciting, because it broadens my perspectives on various issues, and makes me
see the importance of collaborative/interdisciplinary research.  
  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
N/A  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  

Yes. I was interested in several of the pre-formed groups, and unexpectedly
engaged in serious collaborative ideas with the Studio in Sustainability.
David Fox is now officially a collaborator in the "diabetes and indigenous
peoples" project,to be submitted to NIH. Our discussions led me to realize the
importance of environmental planning in a project that focuses on the
socioeconomic determinants of type 2 diabetes among the Eastern Band of
Cherokees in NC, The Yuroks and other populations in California, and among
indigenous peoples in Brazil and in India. Also, Jon Shefner and I discussed
at length future activities for the Latin American program, and will be
collaborating in the near future teaching interdisciplinary courses and
developing course materials.

  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I am not sure. It is a good idea to be open about the themes, especially for
new faculty. But if you did do this twice a year, maybe there could be
thematic areas focused around the interdisciplinary programs that UT already
supports *Asian Studies, Latin American Studies, etc.)  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
High quality grant proposals, better classroom interactions with students,
more collaborative teaching and research projects, with a much better chance
of being funded. Also, I made several GOOD FRIENDS!  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
I don't think I'd be as qualified as you, Beauvais. You seem to be THE PERFECT
person for this: communicative, very articulate, pleasant personality and so
sharp!  
But yes, if needed, I could help out.  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  
  
Thank you, ICE Council, very much for organizing this workshop, and for the
$1500 stipend, which really helped me out. And thank you for the laptop. I
will always be interested in collaborating in any project or activity that
follows up on everything that we did. It was a great, fantastic learning
experience. Thank you!  
  
  
**_Anita Jung, Assistant Professor of Art_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
Meeting faculty from other disciplines.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
Trust the process - it would have been interesting to have allowed group
members without a specific project to have spent time dialoguing and perhaps
found areas common interest.  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  
  
Yes, it has taught me and provided access to several useful tools. I also will
be involved in some collaborative activities with colleagues from other areas.  
  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
N/A  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
I don't know how useful the group I joined will be. However, I believe other
relationships formed will foster some interesting collaborations.  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I believe that interdisciplinary is a theme. It requires trust and a
relinquishing of control by the faculty involved to permit the workshop to
shape its self to the individual participants.  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

It has helped me to integrate myself into this academic community. It will
permit me to be a better informed resource for my students and colleagues. I
hope to curate some exhibitions and co-host interdisciplinary scholars.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
I would be happy to collaborate with someone in leading this workshop next
year.  
  
  
  
**_Jonathan Kaplan, Assistant Professor of Philosophy_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
The 'hand-on' nuts and bolts sessions were very useful, and well-chosen.  
The group working sessions, and group reports, were great -- we got lots  
of input, made some important contacts, and learned a lot about the  
various exciting projects that are on-going here.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
Longer or more structured lunches. Some of the Plenary sessions were not  
as useful as others (though some were great). Perhaps slightly shorter  
days over-all?  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  
  
Yes. I'm much more excited about the collaborative teaching and research  
activities than I was before the workshop. I'm also much more confident  
about my ability to find venues for collaborative teaching opportunities  
and funding for collaborative research.  
  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  

Yes. As I mentioned above, we got great feedback, and the working group
sessions and reports forced us to better articulate our project's goals.

  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
N/A  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

As we briefly discussed, a workshop surrounding the role of visual
representations in various domains would be fascinating. A workshop on

global development issues would be interesting, as well.  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
We hope to submit a successful grant proposal to the DOE this year for funding
to host a conference w/ the goal of creating a network of researchers in the
Southeast interested in HGP ELSI issues.  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
It is unlikely, but possible. Keep in touch..?  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  

Part of what made the workshop possible for me was the stipend. Without that,
I would likely have felt compelled to e.g. teach summer classes, and would not
have had to time to devote to thinking about, and executing, collaborative
projects. It really made a huge difference in how I thought about this
summer...

  
  
  
**_Gary Klukken, Director of Student Counseling Services_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

All parts were very useful. The mixture of speakers, discussion, technical
info, and research projects really made it work well. Excellent planning!

  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
Hold it at the U of Hawaii?!  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  
  
Perhaps not changed as much as revitalized and inspired.  
  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
Yes, definitely. We were able to completely write a small research grant
proposal.  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
N/A  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I enjoyed the "non theme" aspect, although if the theme were very broad, like
"collaboration and technology" it might work too.  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
Interdisciplinary research projects, several grant proposals which could lead
to extensive projects, working with other participants in areas that I had
never considered before, new network of like minded individuals, new
technology awareness and beginning skills  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  

I'd be willing to help put it together, but probably would not have the time
to actually lead it next year (maybe the following?).

  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  

In my 24 years here at UT, this is one of the best experiences that I have  
had. It has broadened my view of possible research and teaching collaboration,
has revitalized my intellectual energy, has helped renew my pride in the
University, and, based on the colleagues I met and the "can do" attitude of
some of the upper level administrators, has given me hope that the University
can indeed make some serious movement toward that "top 25" rank.

  
  
**_Chuck Thompson, Professor of Counseling, Deafness & Human Services_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
* Interacting with new colleagues  
  
* Collaborating with my new research team  
  
* Completing our research proposal and receiving very helpful feedback from the large group of colleagues from other disciplines  
  
* Technology instruction and data base information sessions were great learning experiences.  
  
* Morale building  
  
How could have the workshop have been improved?  
  
I wouldn't change it much. Beauvais did a top-drawer job of organization and
facilitation of the workshop. The speakers were interesting, but the active
learning and work in small groups will help me the most.  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

Absolutely! I will be working on two grant preparation teams and become more
active in our Applied Phenomenology Group. I can see some possibilities for
some teaching collaboration in a couple of our courses: e.g. ethics in
counseling.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  

We improved our grant proposal at least four fold with the time we had to work
as a team and from the corrective feedback we received from the larger group.
We even added a member from the group to our team.

  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
N/A  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

Interdisciplinary collaboration, team-building, and professional development
about cover what we did and what we need to do.

  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
Funding for our proposal which should lead to further funding on a large grant
from NSF or USOE.  

Collaboration with two interdisciplinary grant-writing teams and active
involvement with my current team.

  
More technology in my teaching: course materials on line and power point
presentations.  
  
Some team teaching  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
I don't think you could beat the job Beauvais did. I would suggest that he be
rewarded in a way that would encourage him to continue in the role.  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  

I appreciated the stipend given to the workshop participants. In addition to
building commitment to being on time for all sessions and working hard to
meeting our work goals, the stipend was some recognition that we must to a
better job with our salaries if we are to keep our valued faculty on our
campus. I do want to thank the ICE Council for the opportunity to participate
in the best faculty development experience I have had during my tenure as a
professor on our campus.  

  
  
**_Steve Blackwell, Assistant Professor of Russian Language and Literature_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
The plenary speakers, the working sessions, and the feedback sessions; also
the grant-seeking information.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
Hmmm... the first day had a bit of unstructured wandering in it; also, the ITC  
courses are aimed strictly at entry-level folks and not at those with a little  
experience. I think the ITC time could have been better spent.  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  
  
Absolutely, I am more than ever committed to the idea of gathering diverse  
people to discuss their separate interests in a mutually enlightening forum.  
I was especially impressed by the frequent discovery of new connections and  
possibilities.  
  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
Yes, we went far beyond our goals.  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
N/A  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I think that broadly articulated themes are best, such as "art and
technology", "humanities and science", "ethics and culture", "progress and
culture," etc;  
very narrow definitions would possibly hinder things  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
Grant proposal, Center of Excellence proposal  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
I doubt I'll have time! (If these grants come through....)  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  
  
The various types of plenary speaker were useful: visionary scholar, visionary

administrator, nuts-and-bolts grant finders, practical upstart organizer
(Tyson)... The variety added a great deal to the workshop's benefits for our
group.

  
  
  
**_Jon Shefner, Assistant Professor of Sociology_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
Meeting lots of creative and interesting people.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  
  
It should not be all day for two full weeks. All of us are busy, and although
it was useful and interesting to hear many of the different discussion, it was
too much. I suggest jettisoning the ITC stuff - not that it isn't useful - but
ITC has sufficient prominence on campus that faculty have a lot of access to
their programs. I also would cut some of the plenaries back.  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

It hasn't changed my mind, but only because I was strongly in favor of
collaborative and interdisciplinary work already. It definitely gave me a
sense of how many different folks were interested in working in this way,
which was very positive, and gave me a sense of folks with whom I could work.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
Not Applicable  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
Definitely. I certainly got ideas, and built relationships that will foster
such work. Just knowing these kinds of folks and their shared interests is
very useful.  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
It depends on what ICE, or whatever entity sponsors the workshop, wants  
out of the process. The less-focused theme of this one worked well to  
build relationships, and create a group willing to work together and  
advocate more interdisciplinary focus across campus. If the sponsor  
wants a clear deliverable outcome, above and beyond increased activity  
among the working groups, than a defined theme might be very useful. On  
the other hand, more focus often leaves some people out.  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

I expect to teach an honors seminar, and to design an interdisciplinary
graduate seminar (with perhaps the participation of advanced undergrads) that
will piggyback onto the speaker series I designed. I also hope to work with
some of the co- particpants on other projects.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
I would not be willing to lead it next year, but I would in future years.  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  
  
Please see above.  

Beauvais - a couple of other notes. First, thanks for your hard work. You were
really dedicated and open, and a really important factor in the workshop's
success. Second, I want to reiterate some of my comments regarding the ICE
proposal for a Center of Excellence in as positive way as possible. If the ICE
Council proposes a center which is open to the participation of social
scientists, especially around issues of globalization, I would be really
delighted to work toward that end. I feel that such an effort would really
benefit my work, and those of potential future faculty members. And without
blowing my own horn too loudly, I think I would have something to contribute
to others' efforts as well. I am including as an attachment the project I had
funded by ICE, so you can see some of the work I will be engaged in over the
next1-2 years.

  
  
  
**_Winkie Ilic, Associate Director of the Center for Global Business_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

The most useful aspects of the workshop are many: Our group appreciated the
chance to work on our grant project and get feedback from various people,
participants and presenters included. At first I thought that 2 weeks might be
too long for the workshop, but actually, that much time was necessary to allow
the groups to get meaningful work done, and still have time to interact with
the speakers and other participants.

The technology training was extremely helpful and helped me think about how I
will use it for the course I will teach next spring. The Foundation Center
orientation was invaluable.

  
The speakers were all very helpful and I always looked forward to the plenary
sessions.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

Learning from this year's experience, it might help people at the outset to
understand that there will be certain "unanticipated" outcomes as a result of
the collaborative process, but also to specify a few "concrete" desired
outcomes of the workshop. (This is just something that is appealing to my
personality type, and may not be universally relevant).

At the end, some "next step" issues need to be clarified. Of course, this will
happen through email, and there was a lot to process, but in the next
workshop, perhaps some time should be specifically budgeted for "the next
step". It will be too easy for people to return to their separate worlds and
hope that someone takes the initiative to move what was accomplished even
further forward.

  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

I learned a few new teaching methods, including "collaborative" learning
(which is quite different from "cooperative" learning). I am more aware of how
technology can be incorporated into the classroom, as well as in a distance-
learning. Although I have always been open and aware of the importance of
technology use in the classroom, I think it became more "urgent" to me that I
start using it in more creative

ways.  

I am hoping that I will be able to arrange for some collaborative teaching
opportunities with myself and some of the faculty in other departments whose
fields can have a connection with international management. This is more long-
term, but it is still a goal of mine as a result of the workshop.

I am, by nature, oriented towards collaborative projects, etc. Thus, the
concept of collaborative and inter-disciplinary work is something I fully
embraced before the workshop. I was just glad to learn that many prestigious
universities have managed to find a way to promote this kind of thing without
compromising the quality of their research and teaching. In fact, I can see
that the quality of work was enhanced.

I would like to respond to a comment made by Cliff Woods. He indicated that
the people he talked to regretted their "big move" towards having primarily
inter-disciplinary units instead of traditional colleges. He may have over-
simplified his view of what collaborative work should be, fearing the negative
results of the "extreme" inter-disciplinary structure he described. He is
obviously looking at this from an administrative point of view, but it would
not be a waste of time for the ICE committee to make an effort to clarify what
the options are towards collaboration that are a little more innovative than
what currently exists. In other words, I think that people engaged in
collaborative work will have to educate administrators about this, as they
clearly support inter-disciplinary work, but there is still a very limited
university-wide structure to support it. He said that the faculty must support
one another in inter-disciplinary endeavors (i.e., recognize the value of
collaborative work done by faculty seeking tenure), but I think that the
faculty could have just as succinct a response to lay the burden on
administrators, if given the chance. I guess this is an item for further
dialogue. Maybe it should be a follow-up item for further discussions held by
the "first generation ICE workshop folks".

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  

Indeed, we were able to accomplish much more than we anticipated, primarily
because we had the concentrated time AND the feedback to stimulate more
thought and fine-tuning.

  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
Although I was in a pre-formed group, I was able to establish more
collaborative relationships outside my group, as well.  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

As we discussed in our final group meeting, I can see both approaches being
beneficial. As a rule, however, I tend to prefer more focused themes, but this
workshop worked well without it. It challenged me to be more open to the
creative operation).

  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  

I believe that we have strong preliminary DOE and Center for Excellence
proposals. I also anticipate a few of the faculty hosting visiting scholars
from the former Soviet Union at some point. I will be working with a broader
range of people all over campus as a result of the networking. I will be using
CourseInfo and the ITC resources for my class homepage.

  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  

Perhaps at some point I could volunteer to lead the workshop, but not next
year, as I am just starting a new unit on campus and have a lot of
infrastructure work to do with my own job.

  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  

I see a need for someone to promote something along the lines of an ICE Alumni
group. However, I am not sure if I am the best person to do it. If no one else
wants to, true to my usual style, I may volunteer because I believe that it
needs to be done. Perhaps the group can meet again to discuss how it wants to
continue...in what capacity, for what reason, with what time and resource
constraints, and to what end. My impression is that most people would like to
see something continue, however, what and how was not clear. I am available to
discuss that further, however, I am not able to commit to anything at the
moment. I am truly just defining my actual job duties, and am not in a
position to promise any significant amount of time right now. How's that for a
hesitant volunteer? Thanks for a very useful workshop. I enjoyed it. Please
feel free to ask me any further questions, or ask for any more details
regarding my comments. I want to provide the material you need to gather more
support for future workshops.

  
  
  
**_David Fox, Associate Professor of Architecture_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

The interaction with the other disciplines! Given my lack of opportunity to
visit and discuss each others work, this was an excellent forum. The
organization was good, the plenary speakers was good and the conference added
up to a great experience!

  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

I personally would have liked to had interaction with more disciplines but
this is a personal observation. I mention this reluctantly because this
probably would have meant losing some of the participants. The number and
quality of those participating was just right.

  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

Of course it has. I am more cognizant of the work of other faculty in other
disciplines. This will augment my work. I feel my grant applications will be
stronger and my courses can grow relative to other disciplines. I have
broadened my research base and strengthened my grant writing abilities.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  

Yes, in fact, I was able to take the group into areas that were completely
unexpected, such as anthropology.

  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  

I am not totally qualified to answer because I was in a pre formed group, but
I did sit in on other sessions and learned a tremendous amount. Too, I think I
contributed to the discussion by mentioning things such as the College of
Architecture's relationship to Eastern Europe.

  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  
  
I am reluctant to suggest a theme. This conference was so successful that I
feel reluctant to suggest change. Maybe a theme would be more appropriate in a
few years? Think about it. A theme would have excluded some participants from
this session and diluted the results. Although one might argue the results
might have been better, I revert to the maxim, "if it ain't broke¡­"  
  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
Built work in Knoxville;  
Better work in Chattanooga;  
Better grant proposals during the next academic year;  
Joint grant proposals;  
Opportunities in Eastern Europe;  
More communication with more disciplines;  
new friends on campus.  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  
  
Yes, but next year may not be the best timing. In two or three years,
definitely.  
  
Please include any additional comments or observations on the workshop which
might be useful to the ICE Council.  
  
To reiterate, this was one of the best events I have been fortunate enough to
participate in while at UT. I urge anyone who can to work to make this an  
annual event. Selfishly, I would like to do this again in a few years. More  
importantly, I would like may colleagues in the college to participate. The  
experience was fantastic!  
  
  
**_Carol Parker, Associate Professor of Law_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  

For me, the most useful aspect of the workshop was the mix of activities (for
want of a better word). The plenary sessions informed discussions in the
working groups and provided common references for discussions in the larger
group, and the nuts and bolts sessions were concrete and immediately useful.
The mix gave us both a larger perspective on our projects and the opportunity
to make real, focused progress on those projects. And I am most grateful!

  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

As you might guess from the preceding response, I think the overall framework
and choice of speakers were excellent. The only improvement I could suggest
would be some minor tinkering with the schedule at the beginning to allow more
time for exploration of interests within the group and perhaps double up on
nuts and bolts later on (in hindsight, I'm kind of sorry that we didn't hear
about service learning -- but at the time, it did seem important to have group
discussions instead). It might also make sense to distribute conference
materials a few days earlier (and please do not hesitate to snort derisively
here -- I know I was beyond late in sending my info; and I do apologize).

  
  
Has the workshop changed your ideas toward teaching, research/creative
activity or service? If so, how?  

It's opened my mind to possibilities and resources I hadn't known were
available -- and perhaps to a greater degree than I'm even aware. I've been
quoting things from the workshop pretty much constantly for the past week.

  
If you were a member of a pre-formed group, did the workshop enable your group
to accomplish some of your goals?  
  
Yes.  
  
If you were not part of a pre-formed group, were you able to foster
collaborative relationships which were productive? If so, how?  
  
N/A  
  
Should future workshops have a more focused theme? If so, what
interdisciplinary themes would you suggest?  

I'd say no. The unexpected connections made during the workshop seemed to me
to be the richest.

  
What outcomes do you anticipate from this workshop?  
  
A grant proposal; and if that proposal is successful, a conference.  
  
Would you be willing to lead this workshop if it is held again next year?  

No way I could follow your act, Beauvais. But if there's anything I could
contribute along the lines of writing across the curriculum (or stuffing
envelopes, for that matter), I'd be happy to help.

  
  
  
**_Natalia Pervukhin, Associate Professor of Russian Language and
Literature_**  
  
What were the most useful aspects of the workshop?  
  
The useful aspects of the workshop were so numerous that it is difficult to
single out a major one. I want to enumerate some of them.  

1\. The intellectual atmosphere which has been formed up during the two week
sessions convinced me in the possibilities of a change to the better of the
professional environment which exist at UT. Now I am looking with more
optimism at our future.

  
2\. The brainstorm sessions and the feedback that the Russian project received

from the participants of the Workshop. I believe that the new ideas and new
contacts with the people in the area of East European Studies will
significantly substantiate our proposal for the outside grant which we are
seeking and increase our chances to receive it.

3\. The chance to meet colleagues of the similar interests whom I would
probably never meet otherwise. These contacts stimulated some ideas about
joint projects in teaching and research as well as opened new possibilities
within one's own field. For example, in a conversation with Kathleen Lawler
yesterday, when I was describing my research of a book on Pecherin, a
controversial figure in the history of Russian political emigration, I
realized that I need to consider not only ideological and literary aspects of
his activity but also an psychological frame of his personality. It will shift
the focus of my book narrative.

4\. I liked the format of the workshop which provided for the deep plunge into
the problems of common interest. We had time to devote to discussions. The
financial support from the ICE for participation in this workshop liberated me
of a persistent sense of guilt which I always experience whenever I take time
away from immediate research or teaching. I am sure that it is a familiar
feeling for all of us in the academia.

  
5\. The variety of the plenary speakers, cleverly chosen both from the other
UT colleges and from the outside, was very refreshing and stimulating.  
  
How could of the workshop have been improved?  

In my preliminary answers I mentioned that need of more participation from the
side of administration. When on the final day of the workshop the mutual
anonymity of both sides began to crack we felt that it can be a turning point
in the relationships between us. The workshop might become a link between
faculty and administration which will improve the mora

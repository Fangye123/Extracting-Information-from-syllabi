**About the Course:**   This is an upper division course in American History.
The goals of the course are as follows:  1) to  provide students with a basic
understanding of  the Cold War and its impact on American (and world!)
history, politics and culture; 2) to help students develop those skills that
will allow them to continue to learn from the past, a goal that includes
increasing their familiarity with the AU Library and with information
available on the World Wide Web;  3) to help students learn to better
communicate their knowledge, both orally and in writing; and 4) to help
students develop an informed understanding of historical practice -- the
interplay of history and memory, the role of evidence, how history is created
or "constructed" by historians, museum curators, movie makers and many others.

The course is based on extensive readings, on seminar discussions, and on the
intensive use of  both the AU Library and the world wide web. Because this is
an upper division course, you will be expected to assume considerable
responsibility for your own education, both individually and through work in
groups.  Among other things, you will be expected:

  * to attend class regularly
  * to keep up with all assigned readings
  * to complete class assignments in a timely fashion
  * to actively participate  in the creation of  one or more major Team Projects
  * to actively participate in discussions (both real and virtual)
  * to  take a final exam that will include two parts: one designed to test your understanding of the basic material; the other to test your ability to integrate, evaluate and communicate what you have learned.
  * Graduate students will be expected to do additional readings

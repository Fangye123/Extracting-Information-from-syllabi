    Philosophy of Science, Spring, 1998   Introduction to Philosophy of Science X303 Syllabus Spring, 1998  Dr. Rumsey, Knobview 200LDr. Forinash, Physical Science 101 This course begins with a careful look at a key period in the historyof science -- the Copernican revolution. We will spend the first four orfive weeks of the term studying the activities of some of the key figuresduring that period: Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and others.The rest of the term will involve an examination of the views of a numberof contemporary philosophers of science, using what we have learned aboutthe goings on during the Copernican revolution to evaluate their claimsabout what doing science involves. Texts:  Klemke, Hollinger, and Kline (eds.) Introductory Readings in the Philosophyof Science, Revised Edition Kuhn, Thomas S. The Copernican Revolution     Written and Oral Requirements:   Everyone must write a short paper (4 - 6 pages, typed, double-spaced).The topic for this paper will be assigned shortly after the semester begins.This paper may be rewritten. If you do this, and receive a better gradethe second time around, then that is the grade that will count for thepaper. Before rewriting, however, you must see us and discuss theproject.   In addition to the short paper, you must do one of the following:  Write two other papers of the same length (the first of these may be rewrittenon the same terms as above), or Write a 12 - 17 page term paper. Those who are taking this course to satisfy the research writing requirementmust write the term paper. For others it is optional. If you electto do this, you must make an appointment to discuss a topic with us shortlyafter the first short paper is returned to you. At that time we will alsonegotiate a date for you to hand in a first draft. The final draft of thepaper will be due on the last day of class. We consider the following questions in grading papers:  Did the paper show a thorough understanding of the following:  The portions of Kuhn and other readings in the history of science cited;and The theses of the article in Klemke which was used.  Was the assessment well done?  Was the assessment interesting (non-trivial) and well thought out? Were theses in the article clearly supported or refuted by appropriatecitation of Kuhn and others? Could a stronger case have been made by citing more?  Were any organizational and mechanical (grammar, spelling, etc.) hindrancesto the clarity of the paper minor, or were they so bad as to get in theway of communication?    Beginning with the third week we will ask students to take turns in initiatingdiscussion of reading materials assigned. Expect to do this perhaps twiceduring the semester. You should prepare one or two typed pages of notessummarizing key points or arguments, raising questions, disputing or elaboratingon claims made by the author, or presenting related points which you wantto make. No later than two meetings before the material is scheduledto be discussed you should meet with us after class (or at anothertime if that's necessary) to discuss your draft of these notes. Then youshould revise or augment the notes in whatever ways you think necessaryin the light of your discussion with us. Copies of the revised notes shouldthen be handed out in class during the meeting before the discussion isscheduled. Finally, be prepared to give a brief opening statement (perhaps10 minutes on whatever you find important about the reading) to help usget discussion started.   There will be a written final examination on Tuesday, April 28th, from2:45 to 4:35 PM in our regular classroom. This examination will consistof essay questions which will have been handed out several days earlier.You will be expected to work out answers to the questions and then to writethem in class without the help of books or notes.  Readings: The readings for the course are listed below. Excepting those in Kuhnor Klemke, all will be placed on closed reserve in the IUS library. Thereadings in List 1 will be discussed in the order they are listed. Someof the readings in List 2 may be interspersed with those in List1 as we progress through it, but for the most part they will be discussedafter List 1 is completed and in the order listed. You will be expectedto have read assigned materials before we discuss them in class(whether you are reporting on them or not). Some of the readings will behard going. We suggest that you read through an assignment quickly, thengo back and study slowly. Read actively: ask yourself questions and jotdown problems for class discussion. After the material has been discussedin class, go over it again, this time using class discussion and notesas aids. Whenever possible, do this the same day as the class discussionso that your memory of the discussion will be fresh.   List 1 Ancient Astronomy and Physics: Kuhn, Chapters I - III, pp. 1-99For more on ancient Greek astronomy, read the following in Young (ed.),Exploring the Universe:Santillana, pp. 98-109 (Pythagoreans)Rogers, pp. 110-121 (Spheres of Eudoxus and Aristotle)Rogers, pp. 121-129 (Hipparchus and Ptolemy) Transition from Aristotle to Copernicus: Kuhn, ChapterIV, pp. 100-133Copernicus: Kuhn, Chapter V, pp. 134-184For a little more detail on the Copernican system, read:Rosen, Three Copernican Treatises, Introduction, pp. 34-53. Tycho, Kepler, and Galileo: Kuhn, Chapter VI, pp. 185-228On Tycho's observations helping Kepler, and on the accuracy of hisinstruments and observations, read:Hall, "Kepler and Brahe," in Young, pp. 221-225Christianson, "The Celestial Palace of Tycho Brahe," in Young, pp.226-231On Kepler's struggle with the data, read:Koestler, "Kepler ?

We ask youto help us by using this as often as possible. This method of solicitingstudent evaluations of the class has, we think, a big advantage over theusual method (asking you at the end of term to fill out a questionnaire):you can let us know of problems while we still have time to correct them,and you can let us know what is working well so we can be sure to continuedoing it. You will be asked for a user name and password before being givenaccess to the page. We announced these to the class, but if you have forgottenthem you should ask us or another student.

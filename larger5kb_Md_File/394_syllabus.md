COURSE REQUIREMENTS

This class is designed as a lecture, reading, and discussion course.

There will be three lectures each week on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays
from 11:30-12:20, 109 South  
Kedzie. Lecture material is **essential** for the midterms and the final.

Discussion Sections are an integral part of this course. These meet on various
days during the week and are  
required. Attendance and participation in discussions are **essential**.

This course makes substantial use of Internet technology to deliver course
material and facilitate student  
exploration of modern American history. Students will be expected to subscribe
to the History203 electronic  
discussion list and to use the course webpage on a weekly basis.

**GRADING** : Participation will count for 25 percent of the course grade.
Short written assignments will be due each  
week. These will be assigned weekly off of the course webpage and will usually
entail listing questions for discussion,  
outlining a reading, writing a short think-piece, or utilizing the Internet to
explore an issue further. Completing all of  
the weekly readings and preparing for discussion by putting effort into these
weekly assignments can significantly  
improve one's final grade. Participation grades will be based equally on these
assignments and on oral participation.

The major written requirements for the course are two take-home midterm essays
and a take-home final paper. The  
midterms each will be worth 20 percent and the final 35 percent of the course
grade. (Please note the due dates of  
these papers. All three will be assigned well in advance and are expected in
on time.)

>>   * Now is another good time to check out the
[WebElements](http://www.shef.ac.uk/~chem/web-elements/). It provides a
terrific periodic table with loads of information about the elements.

>> **CASE STUDY: THE DEATH OF NAPOLEON,** Did Napoleon die of arsenic
poisoning, and if so, were the British responsible? An interesting series of
events led to the belief that the wallpaper in his home in exile may have
caused his death. For a website about the case, see [Grand-
Illusions](http://www.grand-illusions.com/napoleon/napol1.htm). And if you
have a few minutes to spare, back up to the [Grand-
Illusions](http://www.grand-illusions.com/index.htm) main page for a
fascinating collection of "optical illusions, scientific toys, visual effects,
and even a little magic."

>> No one had heard a shot. And yet there was the dead man, and there the
revolver bullet, which had mushroomed out, as soft-nosed bullets will, and so
inflicted a wound which must have caused instantaneous death.

>>   * [The Kennedy Assassination Home
Page](http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/home.htm) contains theories about the
assassination, evidence, articles, and conspiracy links.

>>   * A terrific page dedicated to an analysis of the bullets is available at
[Jerry Robertson's Photo Study of Bullet Lands and
Grooves.](http://www.acorn.net/jfkplace/03/JR.html) CAUTION: I had trouble
using Netscape with this site but it works well with Explorer.

>>   * The [Academic JFK Assassination Web
Site](http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/JFK.html) also contains some terrific stuff
including images from the Zapruder film. The link to [Scientific
topics](http://karws.gso.uri.edu/JFK/Scientific_topics/Scientific_topics.html)
includes the Neutron Activation Analysis of the bullet fragments.

>>   * Still another site with lots of information is [JFK Assassination
Research Materials](http://www.jfk-info.com/index2.html). Follow the link to
the Site Map and then way down on the page at Miscellaneous, check out the
Rahn notes for neutron-activation analysis. Caution: This site also seems
better with Explorer.

available at Wayne Hill's web site.

**9\. Chemical Bonds**

> Hill and Kolb, Chapter 5, "Chemical Bonds: The Ties that Bind"

>

>> ![](new.gif)If you haven't checked the Periodic Table from
[WebElements](http://www.shef.ac.uk/~chem/web-elements/) mentioned in Section
5. Chemistry: A Science for all Seasons and in Section 7. Atomic Structure,
now is a good time to do so. Also check this [Periodic Table
site](http://chemlab.pc.maricopa.edu/periodic/periodic.html) which has many
links discussing aspects of the table and showing a number of alternative
forms of the Periodic Table.

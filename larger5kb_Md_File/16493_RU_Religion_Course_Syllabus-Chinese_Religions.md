COURSE DESCRIPTION

_

This course provides a thematic introduction to Chinese religion from the
beginnings until modern times. It examines distinctive concepts and
institutions in the religious thought, practice and organization of China.
Emphasis will be placed on the diversity of religious expressions in China,
with readings drawn from a wide-range of texts: sacred scriptures,
philosophical tenets, popular literature and modern historical and
ethnographical studies. Special attention will be given to those forms of
religion common to both "elite" and "popular" culture: cosmology, family and
communal ritual, afterlife, annual festivals, morality and mythology. The
course also raises more general question concerning gender, class, political
patronage, and different concepts of religion.

Description: Most lay people associate modernity with industrial civilization
in the Western hemisphere. This course will challenge such ideas by focusing
on a study of the period and region identified with the Mughal Empire in South
Asia. This period witnessed the arrival of European trading groups at the
southern tip of the peninsula and of pious men, soldiers and chiefs from
Central Asia in the north. Over time, both groups came to assimilate many of
the social structures and political symbols of existent South Asian life, and
in turn, influenced the latter. This course will explore two related themes in
this multi-layered process: the nature of the changing political systems of
the period and the social and cultural world represented by works of literary,
civic and religious imagination.  
Type of Instruction: Student-led discussion, with summaries by Instructor.
Specific themes of lectures are indicated in the Syllabus.  
Requirements: Since participation in class contributes to 20% of the grades,
attendance is one requirement. If students expect to be absent, they should
discuss this with the instructor ahead of time. At the beginning of term,
students will sign up on a piece of paper circulated by the instructor,
according to which they will open the discussion on that particular reading.
This includes a brief 5-minute summary of the reading, and an additional 5
minutes in which the student raises questions that strike her/him to be of
significance in the given reading. Every student will be expected to respond
with a comment / observation on that reading. It follows that all students are
required to complete assigned readings before each class. In addition to this,
all students will complete a map exercise at home (contributing to 10% of
grade), write two short papers each of a length of 5 pages (1800 to 2000
words) on first-hand accounts of the period (both contributing to 30% of
grade) and write a one-page (500 words) response to a film (10%). A long
essay, between 5 and 10 pages (30%) at the conclusion of the course on a theme
of the student's choice from among the themes from the second half of the
course will form the final open-book exam. The choice of themes for the final
essay will be determined in the course of discussion with individual students,
in office hours. Students are required to attend office hours at least twice
during the semester, and check email regularly for general postings from the
instructor.

John F. Richards, The Mughal Empire (Cambridge, 1993)

**Course Description:**

The Birth of the Modern World explores the question "What does it mean to be
modern?" To do so, we will read, discuss and write about the works of some of
the most influential men and women of the sixteenth to the eighteenth
centuries.  This is the period that historians from the nineteenth century
onward identifed as the time in which modernity was forged.

The term "modern," though, has long been problematic, and in the last two
decades some historians and social theorists have even argued that we have
entered a new "postmodern" age.  If we asked most people on the street what
"being modern" means, they might say that science, rationalism, and a faith in
human progress and improvement are all part of the mix of values that comprise
modernity.  Yet most of the work of recent postmodernist theorists has
suggested that modernity--understood in terms of developments like science,
rationality, and progress--is clearly a mirage.  Many modern people, they
point out, are clearly no more scientific or rationalistic in their thinking
than people of the "premodern" past.

But do these concepts tell the whole story about what it means to be "modern"?
Clearly, we need to refine our definitions, but here even the dictionary is of
little help.  It defines modern as an adjective that "refers to the present or
the immediate past," and lists a synonym as "contemporary."  It also tells us
that the same word, "modern," can be used as a noun, as in a person who is a
"modern."  History itself clearly provides us with a better guide for
answering the question "What does 'being modern' mean?" than can dictionary
definitions.

Desiderius Erasmus, the first Modern?

To begin to answer this question we will first look at the sixteenth-century
humanist and religious reformer **_Desiderius Erasmus, (1466-1536),_** the man
whom many have long identified as the "first modern."  Erasmus led an assault
on the values and beliefs that we now associate with the "premodern" world,
but he did so centuries before science, rationality, and a faith in human
progress became the defining characteristics of modernity.  In place of the
premodern love of ritual and a religion of obligations, he championed
Christianity as an ethical system, one that would be dominated by an attempt
to live according to what he called "the philosophy of Christ."  In Erasmus's
work we will explore the values and beliefs that historians and lay people
have often admired as "modern," including his distaste for superstition and
his admiration of civility and tolerance.

These values, however, were not always shared by other figures, figures whom
we have long identified as modern as well. **_Martin Luther (1483-1546),_**
the founder of the Protestant Reformation, could often be dogmatic and
intolerant, as could his Catholic opponents **_Teresa of Avila (1515-1582)_**
and ** _Ignatius Loyola (1491-1566).   _**Yet each championed freedom of
conscience and argued that individuals could experience God directly without
the intrusions of human institutions like the Church.  Are these the
dimensions of their thought that have allowed historians to see them as
"modern"?

To the men and women of sixteenth-century Europe, atheism and unbelief were
not options.   Human existence and history could not be explained without
recourse to Jewish and Christian ideas about the world's divine Creation and
purpose.  Yet at this same time we can also detect a growing dissatisfaction
with traditional explanations of human existence, together with a rising
distaste for Christian morality.  Historians have long called this movement
"the growth of skepticism," and they have identified it as part of the mixture
of developments that helped to shape modernity.  In his _Essays_ , **_Michel
de Montaigne (1533-1592)_** tried to create a new vision of morality centered
around human needs and desires.   The _Essays_ were his life work, a titanic
journey inside the deepest recesses of the self, to try to understand what
being human meant.   Montaigne doubted all received learning and wisdom.
Everything must be doubted, he counselled, so that truth can be established.
At the same time, he was sometimes frighteningly pessimistic about human
beings' ability to understand themselves.  In sum, he judged Man "a reed, but
a thinking reed."

If Montaigne remained the perennial doubter, some who followed him continued
to cling to the traditional wisdom of Christianity with ferocious energy, even
though they suspected it might not hold answers to all the questions they
posed.  **_Blaise Pascal (1623-1662)_** was a brilliant mathematician, the
inventor of the first mechanical computer. His life coincided with the rise of
a more mechanistic and less Christian view of the universe, one that was
championed by such figures as the persecuted Galileo (1564-1642).  Pascal
sensed the dangers that lurked in this science, but at the same time, like
Erasmus, he criticized the "easy" Christianity of rituals and obligations.
Throughout his work he frequently cautioned that science and rationality would
never hold all the keys to human existence.  "The heart has its reasons," he
advised his readers, "which reason does not know."

Yet the search to establish with certainty the laws that governed human
existence continued, despite the anxiety it might cause a figure like Pascal.
In the mid-seventeenth century two English social theorists, **_Thomas Hobbes
(1588-1679)_** and **_John Locke (1632-1704)_** tried to create a rational
vision of human existence based upon the concept of "natural law."  Their work
helped to lay the foundations for the Enlightenment, a broad, European-wide
philosophical and social movement that embraced tolerance, freedom, and
rationalism as its primary values. Both Hobbes and Locke tried to distinguish
the character of human existence in something they called "the state of
nature," that is, before government and civilization shaped human experience.
In his _Leviathan_ Hobbes argued that the state of nature was dismal, and that
strong governments arose from the necessity to surmount and control the
wicked, selfish nature of individuals.   Locke, on the other hand, argued from
a more optimistic perspective, and insisted that the best governments were
those that restricted human freedom the least.  In his _Letter Concerning
Toleration,_ for instance, we see Locke arguing for freedom of religious
practice.

Yet there were limits, even among these forward-looking thinkers.  Locke
championed religious freedom, but only for different brands of Christians.
And neither Locke, nor most of the philosophical writers of the Enlightenment,
were willing to grant greater rights or freedoms to women.  The work of
**_Aphra Behn (1640-1689)_** comes to us at a time when women were just
beginning to emerge as writers and social critics.  Behn was the first English
women to support herself as a writer, mostly as a playwright for the London
stage.  Although many of her works were conventional, her characters
frequently mocked seventeenth-century social realities, including the arranged
marriage of women.  Behn, too, had travelled in the Americas, and her short
novel, _Oroonoko_ , emerges as both a critique of colonialism and an
unsettling portrait of non-Europeans.

In his _Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding,_ ** _David Hume (1711-1776)_**
continued the venture of Enlightenment begun by Hobbes and Locke.  Like
Erasmus, Montaigne and other thinkers of this "early-modern" period, Hume
regarded much traditional religion as nothing more than fallacious
superstition. Catholicism, according to Hume, was "like all other species of
superstition . . ." that agitated " . . . the vain fears of unhappy mortals."
In the _Inquiry,_ he criticized these beliefs and argued for a view of reality
untainted by notions of God's miraculous intervention in human affairs. Logic,
science, and observed or "empirical" realities should be the only foundation
for human actions and beliefs.

Hume's critique was altogether cerebral in nature.  He wrote about
epistemology, that is, the science of human knowledge or how human beings
established that their most cherished premises were true.  Other advocates of
Enlightenment wrote scathing social satires, aimed at a broad audience that
was now emerging in Europe's cities.  Two of these round out our examination
of the birth of the modern, **_Jonathan Swift's (1667-1745)_** "A Modest
Proposal," and _ **Francois-Marie Arouet's (1694-1778)**  _ or
**_Voltaire's_** _Candide_.   In his "Modest Proposal" Swift champions human
liberty and pokes fun at English attitudes toward the Irish through the most
outlandish of proposals.  With tongue in cheek, he advocates the outrageous
solution to a recent famine: Irish children should be bred for food!  In
_Candide_ , on the other hand, Voltaire attacked the complacency of some of
the Enlightenment's idealists, who argued that human existence would gradually
improve.  One of the main characters in the novel, Master Pangloss, constantly
spouts the dictum, "Everything is for the best, in this the best of all
possible worlds."  Yet the actions of the story bely such simple conclusions
about life.  For Voltaire, there was nothing automatic about human improvement
or betterment.  Virtuous human action consisted, according to Voltaire, in
assessing realistically the problems of society and fighting to change them.

As these brief synopses have illustrated, there was never a single vision of
modernity.  Creating "modern" values, ideals, and concepts was a centuries-
long, contested process.  The "Birth of the Modern," then, will be an
introduction to the ideas and trends that have shaped our own sensibilities
and perceptions.  We will not authorize any particular notion of what "being
modern" is, but instead use the question, "What does it mean to be modern?" as
a springboard for examining some of the West's most profound thinkers.  Our
explorations of these key intellectuals will take as the point of departure
that modernity is a multi-faceted, complex phenomenon.  In the period between
the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, the period of the "birth of the
modern," Europeans expressed a dizzying variety of ideas about the ways that
an individual should best experience and interpret their own lives.  Some
figures were deeply religious and Christian in their outlook.  Some were
skeptical and championed human reason as the only way in which human beings
should approach the world.  Modernity, though, was a marketplace in which
these diverse ideas competed for the attentions of Europeans.  This
marketplace flourished in this period because it was a time in which the flow
of ideas was less fettered by the Church, traditional Christianity, and other
sources of authority than in previous centuries.

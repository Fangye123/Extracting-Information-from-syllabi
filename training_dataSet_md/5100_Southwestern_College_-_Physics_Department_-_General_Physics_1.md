**Textbook**

_University Physics_ , Ninth Edition by Hugh D.Young and Roger A. Freedman.
Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Massachusetts.

**Course Requirements**

  1. Quizzes - A quiz will be given near the end of each chapter. The instructor will give the class at least one day prior notice of a quiz. At the end of the semester the quiz with the lowest score will be dropped. **Makeup quizzes will not be given**.

3:00 pm will be canceled in order to assure all faculty is available to
participate in assessment activities planned by departments. Departments
and/or programs have the prerogative of requiring student participation in
assessment activities. Students should not assume Assessment Day will be a day
of vacation.

**Policy Regarding Academic Integrity**

The policy on academic integrity is on file in the natural science division
office. The policy can also be found on page 92 of the 2000 - 2001
Southwestern catalog. The student is responsible for reading and understanding
this policy. In this class the policy will be strictly followed.

##  Laboratory Materials

  * Significant Figures
  * Accuracy of Experimental Results 
**Significant Figures**

The digits required to express a number to the same precision as the
measurement it represents are known as significant figures. It is important
for you to learn how to record measurements using the proper number of
significant figures. Failure to learn this relatively simple task will result
in a failure to communicate the results of an experimental measurement.

If the length of an object is measured as 20.45 cm, this quantity is said to
be measured to only four significant figures. If written as 0.0002045 km, it
is still measured to only four significant figures since the zeroes preceding
the 2 only indicate the position of the decimal point. As a general rule,
zeros are significant if they fall between two non zero significant figures or
they are located to the right of a significant figure and are also, to the
right of the decimal point. In the above measurement, the zero between the 2
and 4 is a significant figure. However, the other four zeros are not.

In the majority of recorded measurements, the last figure should represent a
guess. If the above measurement of 20.45 cm is made with a meter stick, the
last digit recorded is an estimated figure representing a fractional part of a
millimeter division, the smallest division (or least measure) shown on the
meter stick. In other words, the five is a guess or an estimate. All recorded
data should include the last estimated figure in the result, even though it
may be zero. If a measurement of an object is found to be exactly 10 cm, it
should have been recorded as 10.00 cm, not 10 cm, since with the meter stick
you can estimate to 0.01 cm. If the student were to record the measurement as
10 cm, he or she would be communicating to the instructor and to others that
the actual value is somewhere between 9 cm and 11 cm. This represents an
uncertainty of the measured value of 10 cm of plus or minus 1 cm. However, by
recording the measurement as 10.00 cm, the student is indicating that the
measurement is between 9.99 cm and 10.01 cm. This represents an uncertainty in
the measured value of plus or minus 0.01 cm. An uncertainty of 0.01 cm is far
better than an uncertainty of 1 cm.

A reading of 20.45 cm, means that the value actually lies between 20. 44 cm
and 20.46 cm, or that there is an uncertainty of 0.01 cm. This is an
instrumental error of 0.01 cm in the measured length of 20.45 cm or an
instrumental fractional error of .01/20.45 = 0.0005. The word instrumental
refers to the meter stick used to make the measurement. The fractional error
can be represented as a percentage by multiplying the above result by 100.
Therefore, the instrumental error for this measurement, using a meter stick,
is 0.05%. You should develop the habit of making similar calculations.

Many quantities are determined through the combination of several measured
quantities. For example, the volume of a cylinder is given by the following
equation:

V=(0.785)d 2h

Where d is the diameter and h the height of the cylinder. To determine the
volume of the cylinder, you would need to measure its height and diameter. In
this example, the volume represents an indirectly measured quantity, where the
height and diameter both represent directly measured quantities. The
measurements of the directly measured quantities will each have an
instrumental error associated with it. An important question is how do the
measurement errors in directly measured quantities affect the precision of the
calculated quantity?

To find how many figures should be kept in an indirectly measured quantity and
to determine how precisely directly measured quantities should be measured,
you should observe the following general rules:

  1. **Sums and differences:** Quantities to be added or subtracted should be measured to the same number of decimal places regardless of the number of significant figures. The result of either operation should retain no more decimal places than the quantity having the fewest decimal places. Note the difference between decimal places and significant figures. The measurement of 20.45 cm has four significant figures and two decimal places to the right of the decimal point. 

Example: To add the three lengths; 10.07 cm, 0.0126 cm, and 4.1 cm, imagine
them written in columnar form as:

10.07  
0.0126  
4.1  

which then reduces to:

10.1  
0.0  
4.1  

The result is reported as 14.2 cm and not as 14.1826 cm. NOTE: the reduction
in significant figures and the rounding off takes place before the
mathematical operation of adding is performed.

  2. **Products and quotients:** Quantities which are to be multiplied or divided should be measured to the same number of significant figures. The common practice is to carry one more significant figure than that in the least significant number. 

Example: Consider the following laboratory problem:

(47.213 x 12.1 cm)/0.072 Sec

Note that the measurement of 0.072 Sec has the fewest number of significant
figures (2 significant figures) of the three measurements.

The above should be rewritten as: (47.2 x 12.1 cm)/0.072 sec

(2 significant figures with one non-significant figure carried during
calculations) and then solved with the result being expressed as 7900 cm/sec
and not as 7932.22 cm/sec. Note that the above result has only two significant
figures. The two zeros to the right of the 9 are present only to place the
decimal point. The result could have been written as 7.9 x 102 cm/sec.

  3. In dropping figures which are not significant, the last figure retained should not be changed if the first figure dropped is less than 5 and should be increased by 1 if the first figure dropped is greater than 5. If the first figure dropped is 5, then it is common practice to add 1 if it makes the last figure retained an even number. 

Examples: In rounding off the following to two significant figures we write:

7932.2 as 79 x 102  
0.0555 as 0.056  
56.47 as 56  
0.465 as 0.46  
0.00567 as 0.0057  

**Accuracy of Experimental Results**

Several statistical measures are used to express the accuracy or estimated
accuracy of an experimental result in a quantitative form. Those with which we
shall be concerned are percent error and percent difference.

  1. Percent error is defined as 100 times the ratio of the error made in measuring a quantity to the correct or best accepted value of the measured quantity. 

% error = (error x 100)/correct value

The value of the error is the arithmetical difference of your measured or
computed value minus the correct value which may give a plus or minus value.
This measure of accuracy is useful only when there is a universally accepted
value with which to compare your results.

  2. When we have measured or calculated a quantity by two independent methods neither of which is expected to be overwhelmingly more exact than the other, the percent difference between the results of the two methods may be a useful test either of our experimental result or of some assumption which has been made in order to carry out the calculation. Percent difference is defined as 

% difference = (difference of two values x 100)/average of two values

**Purpose of Course**

Our purpose is to examine the critical slices of modern history that encompass
dramatic challenges to the internal and international order of political
regimes. When new nations come into being, and established nations go out of
existence, when revolutions and wars occur, when leaders become demagogues,
then we have the opportunity to examine the greatness and the frailty of
statesmanship, diplomacy, and peace-keeping efforts. We focus on the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries because they fundamentally transformed what
Machiavelli referred to as "old modes and orders" and introduced the novel
phenomenon of modern mass democracy and modern totalitarianism. Within this
framework, we observe the revolutionary emergence of the nation-state and, at
the same time, the strongest challenge to the centrality of the nation-state
in the form of transnational appeals to class, race, and ethnicity.

We begin with Machiavelli, long recognized as the "founder" of the modern
nation-state, the main actor in the modern scheme of politics, and the
defender of the morality of necessity in relations among nations. We then
examine the French Revolutions of the nineteenth century and the totalitarian
movements of the left and right in the twentieth century. These revolutions
and movements have defined both domestic and international politics across the
globe. In addition to examining traditional original written and printed
material, we also examine the impact of the audio and visual media on the
conduct of international politics by such figures as Hitler, Churchill,
Roosevelt, Kissinger, Reagan, and Thatcher. This is particularly important in
the twentieth century because these new modes of communicating offer the
political leaders an unprecedented opportunity to influence the ordinary
citizen.

There are a set of questions that define the course. Why did the original
(1789) and subsequent (1848) revolutions occur and why did the promise of
political and economic freedom collapse into dictatorial rule and
administrative centralization? What made socialism and fascism so seductive to
the academic intelligentsia and political activists in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries? Were these revolutions primarily on behalf of economic,
political, or religious freedom, and who opposed these demands for fundamental
change and why? On what grounds were the revolutions justified? To what extent
were the thoughts and deeds of the American Revolution on behalf of personal
liberty and constitutional democracy appealed to by the various sides in the
European theater over the last two centuries? Why did such "reflective
activists" as Edmund Burke, Alexis de Tocqueville, and Karl Marx consider the
1789 Revolution to be unique and why did they think it contained the secrets
of future politics? What did Tocqueville think led to the election of Napoleon
as the first president of the French republic and what did he do to protect
liberty from revolutionary socialism and military dictatorship. Why did all
three choose the revolutions in France as their context for discussing the
fate of liberty in the modern world? Was the totalitarianism of the twentieth
century unique or can its origins be located in the heart of the western
tradition? In other words, was totalitarianism a derailment or a fulfillment
of "western values?" __ How do Churchill and Roosevelt locate the twentieth-
century crisis in terms of the larger picture of the values of western
civilization? How did Lenin, Hitler, and Stalin take advantage of the modern
sense of egalitarian justice to advance their cause? Do you think that Hannah
Arendt's thesis concerning Eichmann and the banality of evil makes sense?  


**Course Requirements and Calendar**

1\. Attendance and Participation: 20%.

2\. Conceptual Presentations: 40%.

Each participant can expect to deliver at least four conceptually-oriented
presentations on specifically assigned material. This material will include
regularly assigned readings as well as recommended material not listed in the
syllabus. This could well include reviews of audiotapes, videotapes, and CD's.
The overall purpose of these presentations is _not_ to simply describe a
critical event or what an author, law, policy etc., states; rather, the point
is to inform and to interpret the material, stimulate discussion, and to
relate the assigned material to the larger goals of the course. A brief
outline of your remarks should be circulated to other participants preferably
one class meeting prior to delivery.

3\. Research Paper: 40%.

Each participant shall choose a topic--cleared by me no later than 22 March--
that addresses an important writer or public figure or critical event
concerning statecraft and diplomacy, or discusses an international public
policy issue of historical or contemporary importance. The paper must be
informed by the original literature covered in class and the literature can
include audiotapes, videotapes, and CD's. Put differently, the paper must meet
the following two tests: it could not have been written without taking this
class and yet it does not simply duplicate what is done in class. The paper
should be 12-14 pages in length, and conform to standards appropriate for
submission to a professional journal. A draft outline shall be presented
during the 5 April class session. The deadline for submission of the final
version of the paper is 5 pm on 12 April and no late papers will be accepted.
Please proof-read and spell-check your work.

4\. Please consult the Academic Catalog for registration, withdrawal, and
other deadlines.

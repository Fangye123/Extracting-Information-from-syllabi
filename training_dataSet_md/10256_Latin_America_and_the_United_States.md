**_Description_ : **As the saying goes, Latin America lies too far from God
and too close to the United States. This proximity has affected Latin American
economics, demographics, culture, and politics. The seminar will begin with a
look at three major case studies that demonstrate this influence: the Mexican
Revolution, the Guatemalan Revolution, and the Alliance for Progress. The
major assignment in the course is a research paper.

For the first seven weeks we will be reading secondary sources. During these
weeks, two members of the class will be assigned the task of leading each
particular session. During the last six weeks, the class readings will focus
on the research projects.(See [Paper Overview](class_info/ResPaper.html))
Class participation is an integral part of the course, so attendance is
mandatory.

Please note that most of the readings are available for purchase. Many are
also on [reserve](class_info/USLAres.html). For purposes of discussion, be
prepared to define (1) the authors main point, (2) the type of evidence used
to make that point, (3) your assessment of whether the evidence and argument
convincingly sustain the conclusions, and (4) the relationship to other works
we have read.

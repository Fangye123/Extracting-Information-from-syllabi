======================================================

_Hands-on/Experimentation_ :

As the class proceeds, students will choose to engage in hands-on exploration
of the following materials.  They will be discussed in conjunction with the
readings.

  * Chat rooms -- [AOL](http://www.aol.com/), [IRC](http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/Chat/IRC/FAQs/), [Compuserve](http://world.compuserve.com/), Web-based
  * Computer games -- different kinds/genres ("slash & burn" vs. "girls games")
  * Virtual worlds -- [MUDs](http://www.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Internet_Games/MUDs__MUSHes__MOOs__etc_/FAQS/), graphical worlds, [Palace](http://www.thepalace.com/), etc.
  * [Tamagotchi](http://world.compuserve.com/) \-- using one, exploring web sites
  * Artificial Life -- computer programs (Dolphin, Fish, etc. also, Sim series)

 ======================================================  
  
**Class format** : During the first class meeting, the class will divide
itself into groups. Each week, members of one group will get together before
the class period, discuss the assignment (Where could the readings have gone
further?  What questions did they raise?  What are their greatest strengths?
Their greatest vulnerabilities?), and produce 3 questions for each of the
readings.

The class period will be divided in half;  a discussion of the readings led by
the group that has prepared questions for the class and a lecture/discussion
by the instructor.  At the conclusion of each class, the instructor will bring
the class to a close and foreshadow important themes in the following week's
assignment.  Additionally, there will be a 15 minute break.  
  
**Final paper** :  A final paper is due in class on May 5th of approximately
20-25 pages. It should examine some aspect of the course is greater detail.
For example, the paper could examine some aspect of gender on the Internet (in
MUDs, on IRC, on newsgroups);  experiences of women in the world of computing;
the rhetoric of computer science (including artificial intelligence and
artificial life) seen from a gender-sensitive perspective; gender and science
fiction;  women's political action on the Internet and Web.

**Graduate Student Requirements** :   The final paper for graduate students
should be a seminar-style paper of approximately 30 pages in length.

**Grades** :  The grade will be based on class participation and the quality
of  the final paper.

Gender and Education  
Course Syllabus  
  

This course examines issues, research, theory, and policy on gender and
education from a historical, political, and contemporary perspective. Gender
effects in socialization, schooling, and lifelong learning are analyzed for
their implications for individuals, society, and culture. Intersections of
gender with race, class, and ethnicity are highlighted. The purpose of the
course is to provide an overview of topics, controversies, and positions on
the role of gender in education. We seek to accomplish the following
objectives through readings, class lectures, discussions, and reflections:  
  

  1. Given a set of issues on gender and education, we can analyze them for 
    1. alternative ways of framing the problems raised, 
    2. the research and policy literature appropriate for examining the problems, 
    3. the moral and ethical principles involved, and 
    4. the consequences for individuals, groups, and societies of solutions proposed. 
  2. We can describe how gender divisions are defined across cultures. We can assess effects of these constructions and resulting beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes on our experiences of work, knowledge, power, leadership, and education. 
  3. We can examine the intersection of gender with race and ethnicity, socioeconomic class, immigration status, religion and consider the implications for education. 
  4. We can identify, describe, and apply relevant theoretical perspectives to the examination of selected issues in gender and education. We can describe the assumptions and implications underpinning these theoretical perspectives. 
  5. We can locate, organize, and synthesize research studies on gender and education from multiple disciplines; we can abstract from these syntheses the major constructs formulated and relationships proposed. 
  6. We can identify and discuss implications for gender of research in school achievement, peer interaction and socialization, teacher-student interactions, hidden curriculum, institutional organization and hierarchies of schooling, literacy and numeracy, knowledge production and distribution in higher education, divisions in schooling across cultures, teaching as work, teaching and learning outside schools, and patterns of lifelong learning. 
  7. Given the variety of policy positions toward gender and education, we can identify the origins, the operational requirements, and the potential consequences of each; we can generate applications of each position to our own lives and anticipated futures and specify and defend our preferred policy(ies).   
  

_Course Requirements:_  
  

  1. We expect regular attendance and will take excessive absences (missing more than 6 hours of a 45-hour course) into account in the final course grade. 
  2. We expect people to come to class prepared and to contribute to class discussions and activities. Frequent lack of preparation or failure to contribute will also be taken into account in the final course grade. 
  3. All students are required to have and to use an electronic mail account. These are available free in the Office of Information Technology, Aderhold 231. We may make periodic email assignments. These will all be assessed on a pass-fail basis. Failure to complete email assignments will be taken into account in the final course grade. 
  4. All students are required to complete one oral and three written assignments--two short ones and a class project. The final grade will be based on the following distribution: 
    1. Attendance, preparation, and discussion: 15% 
    2. Oral presentation: 15% 
    3. Two short papers at 15% each: 30% 
    4. Final project: 40% 

_Assignments:_  
  

  1. Standard Option: 
    1. PAPERS: You will submit a 10-page paper at the end of the course on the topic,  "The Relationship between Gender and Education." This is to be a position paper representing how you believe these two constructs are connected. To prepare for this paper, you will turn in two shorter pieces. First, you will prepare a one-page draft abstract of your piece. This preliminary piece will reflect your initial thinking about the subject and will include an outline of the paper and the material you intend to cite. Please attach separately a list of complete citations for any references. Second, you will turn in a short rough draft of the project--no longer than four pages--that reflects your work up to that point. Attach a reference list for any material cited. You may draw from a variety of resources in justifying your position: material read for class discussion, material read for your topical presentation (see below), other literature encountered, personal experiences, and so on.   
  

    2. TOPICAL PRESENTATION: You and a partner you choose will select one of the topics listed on the "Readings on Gender and Education" bibliography for which you will prepare a 20-minute presentation to the rest of the class. This may be based entirely or partly on the citations we have listed. You may substitute or include other materials, but be sure to share your citations. The presentation is intended to be a brief contribution from you on a topic that interests you. The subject you select may overlap with the topic you develop for the final project.   
  

  2. Alternative Option: You may substitute for the standard option a project negotiated with us. This may be work on an ongoing task such as a thesis or dissertation related to gender and education or combined with an assignment for another course that also is related to gender and education. It should result in a project sufficient for assigning you a grade for the course.

#### Course description

We will review the 2000-year evolution of the form of the book most familiar
to modern readers -- the codex (folded sheets stitched into volumes, clasped
or held on one side) -- and the changes in reading and writing practices that
accompanied its evolution. We will investigate formal, typographic, and
mechanical-material traditions of the book, with special attention to
"eccentric" forms (examples: the artists book and some traditions of
children's books). These investigations will prepare the way for the main
threads of inquiry in the second half of the course: 1) What is the "future"
of the book in an age of digital text, e-books, and distributed-networked
multimedia? (A related question: what lies behind the anxious and ecstatic
futurologies of the book typical of this moment?); 2) What are the lessons of
the codex form (as a material, historically-grounded practice) for the design,
use, and aesthetic strategies of emerging forms and practices of new media?

Course requirements include: infrequent reading quizzes; a take-home midterm
exam; a paper engineering project; a final research paper. In the paper
engineering project, students will construct simple pop-up books and present
them in class as examples of the material and mechanical possibilities of the
codex form. Though certainly helpful, prior familiarity with new media tools
and environments (the WWW, standalone multimedia, computer games, e-books,
etc.) is not required.

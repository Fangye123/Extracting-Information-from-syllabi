COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is the second half of a two-term sequence on the United States in
the twentieth century. Each semester can be taken separately and has no
prerequisite. History 369 begins with the Great Depression and describes the
important political, diplomatic, social, and cultural issues of the past 70
years. It covers the rise and fall of the Roosevelt coalition, the subsequent
development of a Republican coalition in the Reagan/Bush years, and the
political debates of the 1990s. It explores the African American movement for
civil rights, the efforts of women and minorities to gain equality in the
United States, and other social movements that developed out of the turbulence
of the 1960s. It examines America's changing role in the world. It also looks
back at the 20th century as we move forward in the 21st. This year the course
includes a service learning component (see below for a fuller description).

COURSE REQUIREMENTS

  * Class Attendance: Tuesday & Thursday, 8:00-9:15 AM 

  * Mid-Term Exam: In class, Thursday, October 3

  * Paper: Due in class, Thursday, November 21

  * Final Exam: Monday, December 9, 9:45-11:45 AM

FORMAT  
  

The class consists of both lectures and discussions. It is really important
for you to participate in class. Your grade will reflect participation, but
even more important, your active involvement will contribute to the quality of
discussions. Films and recordings will be used in class, and occasionally
documents will be distributed for discussion. From time to time, feature films
may be recommended for viewing outside class. Some items may also be posted on
the World Wide Web for your examination. The World Wide Web address for this
syllabus and for additional items will be:
<http://www.users.muohio.edu/winkleam/hst369.htm>

SERVICE LEARNING COMPONENT

As part of the course, each of you will be expected to work for 3 hours a
week, over a period of 3 months, in a service organization of your choosing,
either in Oxford or the larger metropolitan region. To choose an agency,
please check out the volunteer opportunities on the Division of Student
Affairs Service Learning and Civic Leadership website:
<https://admsol02.mcs.muohio.edu:11443/apps/volunteerproj/searchpage.cfm>. You
can also get to this site through the general address:
<http://www.units.muohio.edu/saf/service/opportunities.html>. You may also
choose an altogether different agency. But all choices must have instructor
approval, and will require your supervisor's signature.

You will be expected to choose your assignment in the first 2 weeks of the
term. From time to time, on a regular basis, we will talk about your
experiences in class. The paper, due as this part of the course comes to an
end in mid-April, will ask you to integrate your own experiences and
observations with the 20th century historical background of the issue with
which your are involved. See below, in the discussion of the paper for a
fuller description.

Please feel free to talk to staff members at Service Learning and Civil
Leadership office in 111 Warfield Hall (telephone 9-2961). Rick Devine is
director and Kat Cochrane-Yamaguchi is the graduate assistant.

EXAMINATIONS

Both examinations will be essay tests. The final exam will be comprehensive
and will cover all work done throughout the term.

PAPER

The paper is to be 8-10 double-spaced pages long. It is to deal with the
larger issue with which you have been concerned in your service learning
assignment. For example, if you choose to work with Habitat for Humanity, your
paper would deal first with the issue of housing in the years from the Great
Depression to the present, and the ways the government has dealt with the
problem, then with your on-site experience, and finally with your reflections
on the meaning of that experience. The paper is due in class on Thursday,
November 21.

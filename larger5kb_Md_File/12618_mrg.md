**Media Resource Group**

The purpose of the SAHH's Media Resource Group is to provide both the general
public and the media access to leading scholars whose expertise in Eastern and
Central European history may help to illuminate current events in this rapidly
changing region. A number of leading historians of the Habsburg Empire and its
successor states have indicated their willingness to answer questions and
provide commentary on current events in Bosnia and the other former Habsburg
lands. The media in particular is invited to use these scholars as a resource.

Course Description:**  
This course emphasizes the use of the computer as a tool for problem solving
and quantitative reasoning. Topics to be covered include a survey of the
Internet resources and tools including browsers, searching, web page design
and construction. Networks basics, personal safety online, and social issues
involved with the use and misuse of computers are also covered, along with an
introduction to web-oriented programming. Students will be assigned problems
in each of the content areas studied. This course is intended to fulfill the
computer/computational skills requirement of the general education curriculum.
All students will be expected to satisfy all six basic Computer Competency
requirements described in the "Curriculum Design" section of the Undergraduate
Bulletin before attempting related course work.

**

Computer Competency Requirement:**  
All Undergraduate and New College students who entered St. Edward's University
under the Fall 1999 catalog and later are required to satisfy the Computer
Competency Requirement (CCR). The CCR modules comprise Introduction to
Computers, Introduction to Email, Introduction to Netscape and the World Wide
Web, Basic Library Research, Introduction to Word Processing, and Introduction
to Spreadsheets. Students must satisfactorily complete a web-based test over
each module in order to fulfill this requirement. For more information about
the Computer Competency Requirement, go to:
[www.stedwards.edu/it_dept/competency](http://www.stedwards.edu/it_dept/competency)
or call 464-8816.

**

Required Texts:**

_

  * Internet Literacy_ , Second Edition, by Fred T. Hofstetter, McGraw-Hill, 2001. 
_

  * HTML 4 for the World Wide Web_ , Fourth Edition, by Elizabeth Castro, Peachpit Press, 1999.

**

Other Materials:

**

  * Four PC formatted 3.5" diskettes.

**

Requirements:**  
1\. Attend all classes (for the entire class period).  
2\. Complete all assignments.  
3\. Complete all quizzes.  
4\. Actively participate in all class activities. In order to accomplish this,
you must prepare in advance for all class sessions by reading and studying the
text(s).  
5\. Seek assistance and ask questions about course material or course
requirements from the instructor as necessary. You are responsible for all
material presented in class.  


#### Quizzes:

  * There will be six quizzes given throughout the semester. You are responsible for all material presented in class whether or not it is explicitly covered in your text. 
  * I will use the your five highest scores to calculate your semester quiz average. 
  * Quizzes must be taken on scheduled dates. If you miss a quiz, you will receive a grade of zero for that quiz. As I will be dropping the lowest of your six quiz grades, there will be no make-up quizzes. In other words, if you miss a quiz, that will be the quiz grade that is dropped before calculating your average. If you miss more than one quiz, at least one zero grade will be included in your quiz average. 
  * If you know in advance that you will miss a quiz please contact me as soon as you know about the absence. Normally, accommodations can be made for you to take the quiz early. 

  
**Assignments:**  
There will be four types of assignments in this class. The due dates for all
of these assignments will be posted on the class web site. Late assignments
**will not** be accepted for credit.

**

  * Homework Assignments** \- This course includes a set of seven homework assignments. Detailed information on these assignments will be available on the class web site. Additional information about these assignments will be discussed in class. How and when you turn in these assignments is very important--please pay close attention to the instructions. You will not receive credit for assignments that are turned in late or in the incorrect format.    
  

**

  * Web Assignments** \- This course includes a set of nine web assignments. Much of the work on these assignments can be done in class. However, you should expect to spend time outside of class completing these assignments. Details on and help completing these assignments will be given in class and on Blackboard.  
  

**

  * Social Issues Paper** \- You will write a paper that explores the impact of computing upon society. Details on this assignment will be given in class and on the class web site.   
  

**

  * Semester Project** \- Using the skills that you acquire throughout the semester you will create an extraordinary web page. This will be fun, challenging, and creatively stimulating. Details on this assignment will be given on the class web site. 

  
**Participation:**  
Active participation in all class activities is an integral part of your
educational experience. In order to receive credit for participation you must
**actively** participate in the class.   Active participation includes
contributing to class discussion, participation in group activities, and
regular postings on the course electronic bulletin board.  The electronic
bulletin board for the class is located on St. Edward's Blackboard server at
http://blackboard.stedwards.edu/.  Additional information on how to access
Blackboard will be given in class.

69-60=D; and 50-0=F.

**

Academic Honesty:**  
Unless otherwise specified, it is expected that all coursework and exams
represent only your efforts, not those of a group of peers, hired tutors, or
other plagiarized material. In its broadest sense, academic dishonesty is
defined as representing some other person's work as you own. Students are
expected to do their OWN work on all exams and assignments. When evidence of
academic dishonesty exists, all those involved may receive an "F" for the
course.

**

Attendance**  
It is very important that you make every effort to attend and not be late for
class. You are allowed 2 absences. (Remember, you **will not** be allowed to
makeup a missed quiz or turn in late assignments.)   After 2 absences, I have
the option to WITHDRAW you from the course for absences (WA). If personal
circumstances arise that will require you to be absent or chronically late,
please discuss this with me in advance. Absences, even excused ones, will NOT
excuse you from turning in homework and/or taking quizzes as scheduled. You
have the option of turning in assignments and/or taking exams early without
penalty.

**

Withdrawal:**  
Although the instructor has the prerogative to withdraw students for excessive
absences he is under no obligation to do so. It is the responsibility of the
student and _not_ the responsibility of the instructor to initiate all
withdrawal proceedings. According to the College calendar, May 24, 2002 is the
last day for an unrecorded drop or withdrawal and June 17, 2002 is the last
day to withdraw and receive a grade of "W".

**

Learning Considerations:**  
If you have a certified learning disability that requires special
consideration with respect to your class performance, please inform the
instructor privately of any special needs you may have before the third class
day. You will also need to provide documentation of your disability to Student
Disability Services.

**

Classroom Behavior:**  
We are here to learn and that can only occur in a professional, learning
environment. If you do not behave in a way appropriate to maintaining this
environment, I will ask you to leave the class. Examples of UNACCEPTABLE
behavior include:  


1) Chatting with classmates  
---  
  
2) Reading of non-course material (newspapers, magazines, etc...)  
  
3) Consuming food and/or beverages  
  
4) Using inappropriate language (i.e. cursing)  
  
5) Using a phone (if you carry a phone - turn the ringer OFF before class
starts)  
  
6) Having a pager that makes noise (use vibrate mode or remove the batteries)  
  
7) Arriving late to class  
  
8) Being rude

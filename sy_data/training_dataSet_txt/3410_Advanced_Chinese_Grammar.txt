This is a course in Chinese grammar. The goal of the course is to increase
your understanding of Chinese grammar in order to improve your mastery
of Chinese. A secondary goal is to explore the nature of Standard Chinese
grammatical structure in general and learn how and where it differs from
the grammars of other languages, such as English and Chinese dialects.
The course will be heavily discussion oriented; we will approach our topic
through analysis and dialogue. We will look at Chinese sounds, word structure
and formation, sentence grammar, and paragraph structure, using a variety
of techniques, from analysis to problem solving. This course will demand
that students actively participate; and you will be expected to frequently
present your own ideas and understand all examples in Chinese. Hence to
take this course, students must have studied Chinese up through the level
of 132 or the equivalent. (Others may be allowed to take the course with
special permission from the instructor.)

Quizzes: There will be two quizzes. The first will be on the
sound system of modern standard Chinese and two romanization systems --
Pinyin and Gwoyeu Romatzyh. The second will be on Chinese grammatical
terminology (in Chinese and English). I will provide you with further information
on these quizzes later. No make-ups will be given for missed quizzes.

Exams: There will be a midterm and a final exam covering the
material presented in class and the readings.

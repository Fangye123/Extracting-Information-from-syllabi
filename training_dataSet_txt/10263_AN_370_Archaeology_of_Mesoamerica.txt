Syllabus and Reading List
Updated 10/14/99 4:56 p.m.

Method of reading and taking notes
Readings should be done regularly. They are marked with the book symbol .
The reading assignments should be completed up to but not beyond the week
indicated for discussion that week. By the beginning of week x,
you should have completed all assignments before the WEEK x
indicator seen on the left of the page.
Readings on reserve are marked "(reserve)". To save students
time coming into the library. I will color the "reserve" mark red
if the reading is not yet ready and green
when it is ready. There should be three copies available for people to
read.
The items that are beyond the coming week mark may be changed as the
syllabus is not yet complete. Look at the date of the update above to see
if you have read the latest version.
After some of the readings there are comments, marked with a ?
,
that we may take up in class as possible interpretations of the data. You
do not have to be able to answer the questions in the comments, but you
should be able to discuss the subject.

Archaeological research methods applied to Mesoamerica
Evaluate the different approaches to archaeology that have been taken at
different periods of time.

Early discoveries of the ancient civilizations
 Stephens, John L. (1841) Chapter
17 In Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan.
Vol 2, Pp. 289-307. New York: Dover. (reserve)
 Stephens, John L. (1841) Chapter
18 In Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan.
Vol 2, Pp. 308-324. New York: Dover. (reserve)
? Did Stephens show
respect for the discoveries that were made? What was the basic goal of
archaeological exploration in his time? Can we say that archaeology existed
in 1850?

Popular reaction and fantastical interpretations of the ancient civilizations.
 Von Däniken, Erich (1970)
Chapter 9, The Mysteries of South America and Other Oddities. In
Chariots of the Gods. Pp. 97-107. New York: Bantam.(reserve)
? Note the methods
used by this pseudo-archaeologist. Note how the reader is convinced of
the truth of what is claimed. Archaeology is scientific. Its conclusions
are based on observations of material things. These material things must
be available for examination by anyone, or the reports of their existence
must be unimpeachable. Inferences, a type of theory in archaeology, must
be falsifiable by observation of these material things. Inferences must
be compatible with all that is archaeologically known about the culture.?
How well is the Chariot theory proven?
WEEK 2 - 9/14


The difference between the true pre-history of Mesoamerica and fantastical
interpretations
 Picture
and drawing of the sarcophagus lid in the
tomb of the Temple of Inscriptions. Look at the details of this piece of
sculpture. Do you see what von Däniken sees? Go to the Maya
resources for clues to the meaning of the symbols. Parts
of Linda Schele's analysis should be read when it becomes available
in the library.

**Course Description:**

> In this course we study a number of key figures, intellectual debates, and
major literary movements (Romanticism, Realism, Modernism) of Western
modernity through the close analysis of a number of important texts. The
course emphasizes the profound breaks with the old-European tradition
experienced and enacted by modern intellectuals and artists. We will be
utilizing a sociological approach to intellectual history in order to advance
our insights into key patterns of development of modern European intellectual
life. Class time will be divided between lectures and discussions, with an
emphasis on critical reading and interpretation. For more extensive
descriptions please visit the [BLS 354 Course Notes](coursenotes/bls354.html).

**Title:** Russian-American Relations

**Number:** SS 326

**Format:** Lecture-discussion

**Course Description:** This course explores the development of Russian-
American economic and political relations, emphasizing the era of the
twentieth century.

**Prerequisite:** SS 110, SS 120, SS 130, or junior standing

**Goals:** This course is not required in any degree programs in our
University, but is in the general area of upper-level requirements of HU/SS
courses. The goal of this course is to understand the historical foundation of
Russian-American relations and the impact of these relations on the global
community.

**Course Objectives:** To master course material from the perspectives
provided by the social sciences. To understand the historical foundation of
Russian-American relations. To appreciate the long-term trends in these
relations, trends that transcend such epochal events as the 1917 and 1991
revolutions in Russia. To strengthen critical thinking skills, especially
those related to cause-effect relationships.

**Texts:** Gaddis, John Lewis. _Russia, the Soviet Union, and the United
States_. 2nd ed. New York: McGraw Hill, 1990;  
Libbey, James K. _Russian-American Economic Relations, 1763-1999_. Gulf
Breeze: Academic International Press, 1999. Both books are available in the
University bookstore.

**Reading Assignments:** Students will be able to take superior notes, ask
pertinent questions, and make valuable contributions to the class by
completing the reading assignments for each topic as indicated in Part Two.
Every effort has been made to create manageable assignments that parallel
class material.

**Tests:  ** There will be three multiple-choice examinations: 7 February, 19
March, and 23 April (at 1445 hours).. For sample questions, see Part Four.

**Project:** Students will prepare a four-page paper on a controversy related
to Russian-American relations. They will suplly the professor on 29 January
with a sheet of paper listing the topic and clearly stating both sides of the
controversy. It is the student's option, but the professor will serve as
editor of the second draft before 21 March. The final or presentation draft is
due 4 April. A paper turned in after 4 April will be penalized 10% or five (5)
points. A paper turned in after the last day of classes, 18 April, will not be
graded. See Part Three: Suggestions for the Paper.

**Plagiarism:** It is simply wrong to copy the work of others and offer it as
one's own. Any plagiarized work submitted to the professor will be evaluated
with an "F."

**Attendance:** Attendance will be taken each session. Bonus points will be
awarded to those students who persevere in coming to class. Four points will
be added to the total score of those students who maintain a perfect
attendance record. Two points will be added to the total score of those
students who miss only one class. Students who miss more than two classes will
have two points subtracted from the final point total for each session missed.
Students who are absent and have a legitimate, documentable reason, will be
excused. Examinations test student's understanding of class material. Thus
regular attendance is important.

**Tardiness:** Obviously, students who are late in coming to class will be
marked absent. Such students need to explain their tardiness to the professor
to have the absence removed from the record.

**Bonus Points:** Three bonus points will be awarded for attending one event
sponsored by the University Arts & Letters  
Committee. Events will be announced in class.

**Grades:** There is currently one holiday scheduled for Tuesday-Thursday
classes this semester: Thanksgiving. Class will not be held on 23 November.

**Holiday:** There is currently one holiday scheduled for Tuesday-Thursday
classes this semester: Spring Break. Classes will not  
be held on Tuesday, 12 March, and Thursday, 14 March.

**Conference:  ** The professor will be assisting with arrangements for the
SACS Visitation Team, which will be on campus to reaffirm the University's
accreditation. There will be no class on Tuesday, 2 April.

**Part Three: Suggestions for the Paper**

**Mechanics.** The paper should be typewritten and double-spaced. It should be
four pages in length. Use neither a cover sheet nor a plastic cover. Your name
will be typed in the upper right-hand corner of page one. Double-space down
and type the title. Double-space down and begin the introduction to your
paper. At the end of the paper, double-space down and type the word:
Bibliography. Double-space down and type a list of your four sources.

**Purpose. T** he purpose of the project is twofold. First, you will become
aware of the enormous amount of ambiguity that surrounds Russian-American
relations. Second, you will acquire detailed knowledge about one controversy
in the field. This will be achieved by reading texts with opposing viewpoints
on a given topic that you choose. Thus, you will use the rhetorical device of
contrast in which clarity is achieved by throwing one idea into opposition
with another. The object of the paper will be to explore the controversy
rather than decide which side is "correct".

**Sample Topics.** You will select the topic of controversy. Sample topics are
listed below:

  * Did the Russian fleets visit the US in 1863-64 to gain a safe haven or support the North?
  * Was the US government justified or worng in its attempts to alter Russian anti-Semitism?
  * Was the key to USSR victory in World War II the US aid or the will of the Soviet people?
  * Was destruction of KAL 007 an act of barbarism (as suggested by the US government) or an act of self-defense (as suggested by the USSR government)?

**Format.   **Standard format includes an introduction, body, and conclusion.
The introduction should draw the reader's attention to the controversy, which
should be clearly stated in the paragraph. This first paragraph may also
include other realted information such a sa brief history of the controversy,
why the controversy is important, or why the author of the paper selected the
topic (but do not use personal pronouns). The body of the paper should be
devoted to exploring both sides of teh controversy with two to three
paragraphs for each viewpoint. The last paragraph or conclusion should
summarize the key points made in the body of the paper.

**Outline.** Thus, the standard outline for this project would be:  
                          Title-Topic   
A. Introduction - Clearly State Controversy  
B. Body - Side One of Controversy  
            1\. Paragraph  Supporting Side #1   
            2\. Paragraph Supporting Side #1   
            3\. Paragraph Supporting Side #1   
C. Body - Side Two of Controversy  
            1\. Paragraph Supporting Side #2   
            2\. Paragraph Supporting Side #2   
            3\. Paragraph Supporting Side #2   
D. Conclusion - Summary of Key Points on Both Sides  
                        Bibliography 

**Bibliography.** After the conclusion, a bibliography of four (two on each
side) sources should be listed, including the pages you found useful in
discussing one side or the other of the controversy. Make every effort to use
both textbooks plus the Encyclopiedia of U.S. Foreign Relations. If
appropriate or necessary, please feel free to use interlibrary loan (for books
and articles) or the Web Databases from the Hunt Library, especially Business
NewsBank, Global NewsBank, and NewsBank NewsFile Collection. From the latter,
you may only cite and use **complete (full-text)**. You may **NOT** cite any
information from the Internet.

In seminar format, this course offers a collective exploration of the bases,
dimensions, and processes that underlay the development of what we too easily
term "modern culture" whether in the U.S. or the West more generally.
Specifically, we consider the transformation of urban space and place during
the epochal era from the late eighteenth through the mid-to late-twentieth
centuries. In the process, we critically probe the meanings of both "urban"
and "culture" in concrete social and political economic contexts, evaluating
alternative formulations and relationships as we search for an integrating
understanding. Among the elements of the complex historical interaction we
seek to understand are: social class, gender, ethnicity and race, geographic
space and sociocultural space, accumulation and display, architecture,
institutions, cultural hierarchies (in actuality and symbolically) and
relationships, cultural politics and political economics. Among our organizing
questions are those that surround notions of mass or class cultures,
integration vs. fragmentation, separate spheres, private vs. public spaces,
commercial cultures, control vs. freedom, and the futures of both culture and
cities. Our realm is the historical; our questions, tools, and theories are
interdisciplinary; the boundaries to the inquiry are those we set together in
search of "urban culture".

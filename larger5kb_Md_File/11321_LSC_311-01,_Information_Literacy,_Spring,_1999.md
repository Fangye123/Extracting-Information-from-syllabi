## Course Description

     Information Literacy, a _Viewing a Wider World_ course, is designed to help you become a full participant in our Information Society. Both practical and theoretical in scope, LSC 311 uses a mixture of lecture, in-class and electronic discussions, hands-on assignments and written research projects to give you the technological skills and critical thinking abilities you need to use the printed and electronic information resources found in libraries and on the international computer networks collectively known as the Internet. Once you successfully complete this course you will be able to locate and critically evaluate information, applying these skills and new-found knowledge to your academic courses and in your professional and personal life.

## Brief Explanation of Course Requirements

     Thorough descriptions will be given when assignments are made. 

    

###  Journal (120 pts.)

     Students will keep written journals recording progress towards final research essay and annotated bibliography. Included should be at least one review per submission on a type of information source (printed reference work, scholarly journal, article database and web site) and reflections on research progress as it relates to the final project. The journals will be collected four times during the semester. 

    

### Hands-on Assignments (280 pts)

    Hands-on assignments provide an opportunity to demonstrate your grasp of practical skills related to information transmission, seeking, and evaluation. Sometimes, but not always, class time will be used to complete these assignments. Collaboration between students in completing the assignments is encouraged. (35 pts. each) 
    

### Final Paper & Annotated Bibliography (200 pts)

    Your final project has three parts:   

  1. Annotated bibliography on an instructor-approved topic of your choice - 80 pts.
  2. Evaluative essay which discusses and evaluates both your research process and your topic - 80 pts. 
  3. Oral presentation which introduces the class to the main findings of your project - 40 pts. 

  

    

### Examinations (300 pts)

     You will have three examinations spaced as evenly as possible throughout the semester. Examinations may consist of multiple choice, short answer items, problem sets and brief essay questions. All test items are based on material covered and/or discussed in class and in the assigned readings. Examinations are designed to reward students who regularly attend class, participate in class discussions and keep up with the readings. 100 pts. each. 
    

### Participation (100 pts)

    Your willingness to contribute to class discussions is essential to the success of this class. You will be evaluated on your participation in discussions (classroom and electronic list) and class hands-on activities. 100 pts.

## Course Rules

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF)**Due Dates** :

     All due dates for assignments are firm. Assignments are due at the **beginning of class**. Those assignments received during or after class on the due date wil l be counted as a day late. Late assignments will receive the following deductions:

**Days late** | **Deduction**  
---|---  
up to 3 | 50%  
4 or more | 100%  
  
A physician's excuse detailing the reason(s) for the absence(s) and/or a
documented family crisis will be the only exception to deductions for late
assignments. In these cases, due dates for late assignments will be negotiated
with the instructor.

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Attendance**

     Attendance is not mandatory. You are adults. It is your responsibility to be prompt and attend class. Excessive absences, however, could well result in failing the course. All examinations as well as all course assignments are based on in class discussions, instruction and practice. I will not schedule office hours to discuss missed or not fully comprehended assigments because you missed class. 

     Please be on time. I will not repeat or update you on material missed because of tardiness. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Withdrawals**

     You are responsible for dropping yourself from this course. I do not automatically drop students. The last day to drop is March 16, 1999. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Incompletes**

     University policy requires that incompletes be given **only in special circumstances**. To receive an incomplete, you must have successfully passed the first half of the course and must be precluded from successful completion of the second half of the course by either a **documented illness** or a **family crisis** which I believe genuinely precludes you from successfully completing the course at the end of the semester. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Multiple Submissions**

     I do not accept resubmissions of work done for other courses for your final paper or for any other assignments. The general topic of your final paper may be similar to that researched for another course; however, the content, organization and focus of the final paper for this course is so different that a resubmitted paper will be instantly recognized and will receive a failing grade. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory**

     The minimum standard for an S grade is a C. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Academic Misconduct**

     Anyone who willfully damages, steals, or makes inaccessible to others library materials or computer resources will be dropped from the course. 

     Reading or sending e-mail, surfing the web, printing or using other applications on the computer workstations during lectures or presentations is **unacceptable**. Your screens can be viewed by others. (see below) 

     Plaigarism is unacceptable and will result in a failing grade. Cite all your sources. Paraphrase material used and cite that material. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Classroom Computers and Privacy**

     Your computer workstations are not private. Do not use class time for recreation or conversation. 

    The instructor workstation in this classroom is equipped **to view and display to the class, or to any individual in the class** each and every computer monitor the instructor wishes to display. 

     In addition, the instructor has the ability to blank all or individual computer screens as well as take over control of individual keyboards and mice. 

    Use caution in sending e-mail from classroom PCs. Nothing is private. You will be held responsible for what you do with and on the machines. 

![\[ Push Pin \]](RD_PIN.GIF) **Posting of Grades**

     Prior to March 16th but after the first examination, I will post midterm grades on the course web page. Grades will be sorted and then posted by the last four digits of your SSN. 

    Final grades will be posted in the same fashion. I will also post final grades outside my office door.

## Students with Disabilities

     If you have or believe you have a disability, you may wish to self-identify. You can do so by providing documentation to the Office for Services for Students with Disabilities, located at Garcia Annex (phone: 646-6840). Appropriate accommodations may then be provided for you. 

If you have a condition which may affect your ability to exit safely form the
premises in an emergency of which may cause an emergency during class, you are
encouraged to discuss this in confidence with the instructor and/or the
Director of Disabled Stude nts Programs. If you have general questions about
the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), call 646-3635.

    Welcome to History 3xx. In this course we will survey the history of 
    the region since the early 16th century, and we will emphasize 
    developments and events of the 20th century. During the second half of 
    the semester we will use both country case studies and contemporary 
    issues in our examination.
    
    Using history, literature, films and discussion, we will explore the 
    region's political and economic developments, and creative and 
    intellectual contributions. No prior study of the region is assumed; 
    the only prerequisites are History 102 and a keen interest to learn 
    about a fascinating and complex part of the world.
    
    
    Course grades are based upon the following:
    
    Analytical book review    20%
    Take home midterm       20%
    Essay on fiction             20%
    In class final exam         20%

    Guidelines for each writing assignment will be provided; both exams are 
    essay format.
    
    Your professor emphasizes discussion and writing in this course; to 
    this end, we will often write impromptu, informal responses to each 
    week's readings prior to our discussion. Obviously this requires your 
    thorough reading of each assignment, and your preparation for in-class 
    writing and discussion. This part of the course work counts toward the 
    class participation grade.

    	An upper-level interdisciplinary seminar especially designed for 
    students in the Liberal Studies and American Studies programs, this 
    course is open to other students interested in learning more about the 
    lives and cultures of the numerous peoples in the United States whose 
    point of origin, either recently or in the more distant past, was in 
    Spain or Latin America.  The seminar format means that this class will be 
    highly interactive and participation of all students is therefore 
    fundamental to a successful experience.  Additionally, because this 
    course fulfills the requirement for "Writing in the Major," there will be 
    ample opportunities to do several different types of writing, including a 
    major term paper (an interdisciplinary topic of choice; a handout will be 
    provided with guidelines for the content and preparation at a later 
    point).  Specific assignments are indicated at appropriate dates on the 
    syllabus.  You will be asked to complete a short reaction paper (1-2 pp) 
    for each of the audiovisual presentations.
      	The final grade will be based on the following factors:
    Participation 40%

    This course is designed to introduce students with different aspects of 
    Latin America.  Due to the extreme complexity of the area,  a very 
    general view is provided--although it will help students to broad their 
    knowledge of Latin America through geography, history, social issues, 
    cultural manifestations and outstanding people.  These topics overlap 
    continuosly and by themselves include material for different courses.   
    Although it is recommended the following of the sequence for the first 
    three ones (Introduction, Geography, History) the other ones may be 
    covered in any order.  Sometimes the subdivisions of each topic are 
    too large and the instructor will have to decide which one(s) s/he 
    will use.  These subdivisions fit well also for oral presentations or research projects.
    
    1. Introduction:  The purpose of this section is to make students aware of 
    the heterogeneity of what is broadly called Latin America.   Definition: 
    What is Latin America?   Different approaches on making a definition 
    (cultural, geographic).

    These are my official office hours, but the door is open.  I enjoy 
    teaching and I enjoy talking to you, so if you have questions that 
    we did not answer in class, or if you want to explore an idea,

    Course objectives: 
    
    A. To study the development of Latin American culture by concentrating on the following criteria:
    
    1.  The social-political-cultural evolution of the 
    Latin-American culture(s)
    
    2.  The development of Latin-American fine arts 
    and literature and their role in the establishment of national 
    identities.
    
    3.  A discussion of past and present Latin 
    America's social-cultural issues and problems and a study of the 
    possibilities for the future
     	
    
    B. To improve your Spanish language skills by reading, 
    participating in class discussions, listening to lectures and 
    taking exams.
    
    Course Goals:
    
    To learn about the main events and historical 
    characters that have forged the development and the evolution of 
    the Latin-American culture(s). To address social-cultural and 
    political issues surrounding the people of Latin America.
    
    Internet:
    
    This class will help students to become acquainted with 
    resources available in the Internet.  Please visit the class web 
    site to access vast sources of  information on Latin America.
    http://www.louisville.edu/a-s/cml/spanish/class/laculture
    
    Teaching Methods:
    
    This course is a mixture of a lecture course and 
    student participation.  I expect you to contribute to the class 
    discussions.  Be sure to complete the assigned reading before each 
    class.  Otherwise, you will be unable to take effective notes and 
    to take part in the discussions.  Reading beforehand will make it 
    easier to follow my lecture in Spanish.  While lectures will cover 
    the general topics, the assigned readings will provide you with 
    complimentary information.
    
    Attendance: 
    
    As required by UofL policies, I don't deduct points 
    from your grade if you are absent.  However, if you don't attend 
    class, you'll miss important information that will help you better 
    understand the subject matter, the readings and to do well in the 
    exams.

This is a course in women's history with a particular focus on sexuality.
Women's history involves both the study of women's experience (social,
economic, political) and of cultural ideas about women, compensating for the
neglect and undervaluing of women in traditional history. Women's history also
restructures our approach to history by emphasizing the importance of gender--
social division by sex--as an analytical category, equivalent in significance
to race, social class, and ethnicity and integral to historical study. Such
divisions are mutually dependent: "woman" as a concept can only have meaning
in relation to "man." Hence, this course will treat not only women and
womanhood (in all their diversity) but also the social and cultural system of
gender. Men and manhood will be a minor theme in this course but one that
students may pursue in their writing assignments.  
  
**Prerequisites:** One of 43-249, 43-250, 46-240. As appropriate for a fourth-
year course primarily for History, Women's Studies, and Psychology majors, the
work will be intensive in reading, writing, and discussion.

  
  
**Course Objectives**

  
1\. To develop critical, analytical reading and writing skills, applied to
primary and secondary historical sources and to develop an understanding of
how historians interpret the past through the writing of an historiographical
essay.  
  
2\. To convey the following:  
a. the concept of the social construction of sexuality-namely, that sexuality
is a part of culture and history that has changed over time and taken
different forms in different societies (as opposed to the idea that it is an
unchanging biological entity);  
b. the understanding that women's experience has not been monolithic but has
varied by legal status-slave or free, married or single, social class, and
culture, race, or nation;  
c. the changes over time in the cultural definition and social experience of
women's sexuality from the eighteenth century to the present, with a focus on
childbearing, slavery, Victorian ideology, contraception and abortion,
heterosexual relationships, the development of lesbian identity, and feminist
critiques of sexuality;  
d. the ways that relations of power are integral to sexuality and how attempts
to challenge existing power through social and political movements such as the
birth control movement and feminism have reshaped sexuality.

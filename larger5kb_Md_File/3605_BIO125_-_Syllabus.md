Catalog Description

The production of body fluids (e.g., urine, cerebrospinal, pleural,
peritoneal, pericardial, and synovial fluids); their normal characteristics
and pathological changes will be discussed. A description of the laboratory
tests used in the clinical evaluation of body fluids will also be presented.
Prerequisite **:** CHEM 161 or permission of instructor. Not offered every
semester.  
1 unit.

** Course Objectives

  * to provide the student with knowledge of the production, composition, normal and abnormal characteristics and laboratory evaluation techniques of body fluids.
  * to provide the student with a greater understanding of the pathological processes which occur to produce abnormal fluids.
  * to provide a background for students in Clinical Laboratory Technology and other allied health programs who are continuing their clinical training in professional and graduate programs.

** Grades and Grading Policies

There are a total of two examinations (each 100 points) and a group case study
presentation (25 points) for a possible 225 points in this course.

The format for examinations will be different depending on the information
covered on the exam. Examples of types of questions which may occur on some of
the examinations include multiple-choice, matching, short answer, discussion,
problem-solving, morphology identification, and case study interpretation.
Make-up exams will be given only in the event of an illness or an emergency
and must be made-up within one week.

Quizzes that are taken in WebCT are only for your review and grades will not
be recorded. However, I urge you to take advantage of the morphology review
slides and quiz slides in WebCT. Some of them may be used during examinations
in lecture.

Final Grades are determined using the following criteria:

|

**A**

|

Outstanding achievement

|

90% of total possible points  
  
---|---|---  
  
**B**

|

Excellent performance; clearly exceeds course requirements

|

80-89%  
  
**C**

|

Average

|

70-79%  
  
**D**

|

Passed, but not at average achievement standards

|

60-69%  
  
**F**

|

Failure to meet class requirements

|

less that 60%  
  


|

Plus and minus grades may be given at the discretion of the Instructor.  
  
Cheating Policy

Anyone who is caught cheating on any exam will be assigned a final grade of
**"** F **"** for the course. No exceptions **.**

Add/Drop Policies

The add/drop policies for BIO125 are the same as the University add/drop
policies. Students should refer to the CSUS Schedule of Classes for the
appropriate add/drop dates.

**  
** Technology Requirements

You should be comfortable using a computer and willing to browse the Internet.
This class requires online class participation on the Web assignments.
Students will need a SacLink account and computer access to the Web and WebCT.
All CSUS students enrolled in one or more units can create a
[SacLink](http://www.csus.edu/uccs/inetemail/SacLink/index.htm) account for
electronic mail and Internet services. If you do not already have a SacLink
account, please establish an account before the second class meeting. Although
a home computer with a high speed modem running Netscape or Internet Explorer
would be beneficial, students can access the Web from one of the [campus
student labs](http://www.csus.edu/uccs/labs/generalinfo/overview.htm). You are
not required to have a personal computer to enroll in this class. All
assignments are available on computers on campus.

> Recommendations for hardware and web browsers include:

>

>> IBM/Intel machines: Windows compatible Pentium running Windows 95/98 or
Windows NT with 32 MB RAM (preferably 64 MB), a sound card and speakers, and a
56K or faster modem (28.8 may be slow).

>>

>> Apple MacIntosh: PowerPC based machine, 32 MB RAM (preferable 64 MB), a
sound card and speakers, System 8, and a 56K or faster modem (28.8K may be
slow).

>>

>> Web Browsers: Netscape Navigator 4.0 or greater or Internet Explorer 4.01
or greater (older versions word unpredictably with WebCT)

>>

>> WebCT will run on older machines but performance will be slow.

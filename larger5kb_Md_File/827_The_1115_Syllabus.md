## A. The Course

This course will examine the biblical traditions and texts of the Hebrew
Scriptures as products of particular historical and cultural communities and
as literary and theological documents.

This course is an introductory-level course and has no prerequisites. The
readings are in English. As an academic university course, this class does not
assume the student has a faith commitment.

## B. The Subject

The oldest part of the Christian Bible consists of the Jewish scriptures,
known in Christian circles as the "Old Testament." The Jewish and Christian
traditions (and with some qualifications, the Islamic tradition) consider them
to contain divine revelation. In order to understand the Christian New
Testament, the course of Jewish and Christian history, and indeed the course
of Western civilization, it is essential to be acquainted with these Jewish
scriptures.

These writings were created by a variety of sources within ancient Israel over
a period of many centuries. They represent many different viewpoints,
sometimes building on one another and sometimes clashing with one another.
They contain many different genres or types of literature, including saga,
court histories, songs, aphorisms, and oracles. We will seek to understand
each of the texts in its own integrity.

Our task will be to understand these writings as documents of their own times
-- and as documents that can speak to our own times. Course objectives
include:

  1. To acquire a general, introductory knowledge of the history, literature, and theology of Israel. 
  2. To develop skills in reading the Old Testament text and wrestling with it. 
  3. To develop a sensitive attentiveness to social and cultural distances. 
  4. To listen to the authors of the Old Testament texts and to allow their views to engage our own. 
  5. To earn three credits, applicable to the General Education Requirement. 

## C. Contacting the Instructor

The instructor will be available in his campus office before class, after
class, and by appointment. He works at the University of Pennsylvania during
regular business hours and can be telephoned there. If he is busy during those
hours, and he frequently is, he will make arrangements to speak at another
time. He may often be reached at home during the evenings. Phone numbers are
given above.

Probably the most reliable way to reach the instructor is by e-mail. He checks
e-mail regularly during the day and will respond to e-mail as soon as
possible.

## D. Textbooks

Each student will need access to the following two texts:

  * Lawrence Boadt, Reading the Old Testament: An Introduction (Mahwah, NJ: Paulist Press, 1984). 
  * a Bible in modern English that contains the Deuterocanonical books (also known as "Apocrypha" or "Apocryphal Books").  You may use any of the following Bible translations: New American Bible (NAB), Revised Standard Version (RSV), New Revised Standard Version (NRSV), the Jerusalem Bible or New Jerusalem Bible, the Revised English Bible (REB), or the New Jewish Publication Society translation (NJPS) supplemented with the Deuterocanonical books from another approved version. 

An annotated study Bible is strongly recommended. Several good study Bibles
are available. The Catholic Study Bible (New American Bible) is available in
the bookstore. An excellent study Bible is The Harper Collins Study Bible (New
Revised Standard Version) with the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books,
annotated by the Society of Biblical Literature. The New Oxford Annotated
Bible with the Apocryphal/Deuterocanonical Books (NRSV) is also very good.

Avoid The Living Bible (also known under other names such as The Way) and
other paraphrases for serious study. These paraphrases put an unnecessary
layer of evangelical theology between you and the original text.

## E. Evaluation and Required Work

The requirements for the course include regular participation in class based
on the assigned readings, a take-home examination, a midterm examination, a
final examination, and a journal report. Students may expect to read 100 to
150 pages per week in preparation for class discussions.

Work will be graded as follows:

10% of grade: preparation and informed participation in class  
25% of grade: take-home exam  
25% of grade: midterm exam  
25% of grade: final exam  
15% of grade: journal report  

This class puts a high premium on independent work. Consultation and working
together are encouraged. Plagiarism and cheating will not be tolerated. You
are subject to Saint Joseph's University's Academic Honesty Policy. If you
violate the policy, you will be given a failing grade for the entire course
and your offense will be reported to the Academic Honesty Board for further
discipline.

According to the University College Catalog, two legitimate absences is the
maximum number allowed in classes meeting once a week. Students missing two
classes must be reported to the Associate Dean's office.

## F. Preparation for Class

You are required to read the assigned readings in advance of class. Advance
preparation is particularly important because we meet only once a week. If you
have not read the assigned readings, the three hours of class will make very
little sense and you will not be able to participate meaningfully in class
discussions.

1\. The primary texts of this class are the biblical readings. Reading these
texts of the Bible is the most important part of preparation. The more you
read the primary texts, the more the secondary reading will be able to help
you make sense of them.

As you read the Bible, keep a journal of passages that astound, trouble,
challenge, confuse, offend, or otherwise strike your attention. You can use
this journal to remind yourself of passages to discuss in class. Also, at the
end of the semester each student will submit a report of three passages from
their journal.

2\. Boadt's Reading the Old Testament is our secondary text. This book
provides the framework of the course schedule. Each chapter in Boadt provides
information about the assigned Bible readings and ends with a list of
questions. You should use the questions at the end of each chapter to measure
your level of comprehension. You should be able to answer these questions. If
you cannot answer the questions, you are not prepared for class (or for the
exams) and it would be wise to read the chapter again. You may find it helpful
to look at the questions first and then to read the chapter with the questions
in mind.

## H. The Journal Report

### 1\. Content

You should keep a journal as you read the assigned Old Testament texts. The
journal should focus on texts which strike you as particularly strange or
challenging.

Your report should cover three such texts. You discussion of each text should
cover the following items:

  1. Identify the text by book, chapter, and verse(s). 
  2. Describe the response you had to the text. 
  3. What in the text evoked that response in you? 
  4. Why do you think it affected you in that way? 
  5. Does use of a secondary source (such as a commentary) help clarify the passage in your mind? 
  6. How did (or how does) this text affect your view of God, the Old Testament, and yourself. 

Your journal report will be graded on the extent to which you wrestle with the
text. I will be looking for evidence that _you_ read the text, heard something
new, and responded in some way.

### 2\. Giving Credit

Biblical passages are normally cited by book, chapter, and verse; for example,
Gen. 1:10-11. Do _not_ cite biblical passages by page number. If you
consistently refer to one translation in your report, indicate the translation
you are using. If you use multiple translations, indicate for each citation
which translation you are using for it. Include the translation(s) in your
bibliography.

If you consult any source other than the Bible, you must include appropriate
references to these sources and a bibliography to avoid the charge of
plagiarism. Your paper should acknowledge all material quoted from or
paraphrased from published writing. Failure to acknowledge the use of
another's ideas constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism will not be tolerated. If
you use material that was quoted by one of your sources without actually
checking the original source used, you must give credit to the intermediate
source. If you were able to go back to the original source for yourself, you
do not need to give credit to the intermediate source (but it is scholarly
courtesy to acknowledge someone who guides you to a source).

### 3\. Format

The report should be typed or word-processed using the guidelines in Kate
Turabian's  Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations  (or
another manual of style approved by the instructor). The body of the paper may
contain between 1000 and 2000 words (approximately three to five pages). These
limits do not include notes, bibliography, or appendices. Papers may be
longer, but only if their length is justified by the subject-matter.

### 4\. Due Date

The final draft of the research paper may be submitted as soon as it is ready.
It is due in the instructor's hands by the time and date of the final exam.
Under ordinary circumstances, the instructor will not grant extensions.

### 5\. Evaluation

Three-fourths of the grade will evaluate the paper's mastery of the subject
matter and use of appropriate methods. The other fourth of the grade will
evaluate the paper's writing: its argument and structure, its clarity and
coherence, and its mechanics (spelling, grammar, English usage, inclusive
language).

### 6\. The Preliminary Draft

The instructor is committed to writing and rewriting as an essential part of
the educational process. Because it is impossible to become familiar with the
conventions of a field without practice and because any piece of writing can
be improved, the instructor recommends that each student submit a preliminary
draft of the report. The preliminary draft is not required, however, and is
not graded.

The last date on which preliminary drafts may be submitted is November 31\.
Drafts may be submitted at the Theology office. The preliminary drafts may be
submitted typed or printed on paper -- or, if you prefer to save paper, it may
be submitted in electronic form (in plain ASCII text, Microsoft Word, or
WordPerfect) on a 3.5" diskette formatted for Macintosh or for Windows.
Alternatively, you may send the draft as text to the instructor by e-mail.

The instructor will respond to the preliminary draft as a reader familiar with
the field; he will not proofread. He will return the draft with his comments
at the next class session (or by mail if you enclose a self- addressed stamped
envelope). You will have until the date of the final exam to revise your
draft.

Treat the preliminary draft as seriously as if it were the final draft. If the
draft is not typed legibly or if it contains an inexcusable number of spelling
errors, it will not be read.

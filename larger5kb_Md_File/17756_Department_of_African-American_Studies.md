Course Description:** This course investigates the dispersal, growth and
influence of people of African descent throughout the world through a
comparative analysis of historical, political, cultural, economic, and social
developments of the African Diaspora.



Since the 1940s an important popular and scholastic debate has revolved around
questions about the persistence of Africanisms in American culture. This
debate began as a bitter contestation between E. Franklin Frazier, a black
sociologist, and Melville Herskovits, a white anthropologist. Up until the
1970s Frazier appeared to have won the debate with his assertion that slavery
was so severe and traumatic that it stripped the enslaved Africans of their
Africanity, producing Negro Americans. However, during the decades of the
1950s and 1960s, scholars produced significant and seminal research proving
that there were extremely strong survivals of African derived culture in the
Caribbean and South America. The study of Africanisms in US culture took on
new life in the post-civil rights era, when many African Americans embraced
their Africanity via the cultural aspects of the Black Power movement. From
the mid-1970s, this expression of identification with Africa has evolved into
a school of thought known as Afrocentrism. This course examines the linkages
between African derived peoples and examines their contributions to the black
Atlantic world.

December 14 Final Exam** **8:00 am**

**Class Attendance:** The format of the course will be lecture/discussion. I
expect you to read your materials by the day they are under discussion.
Students are required to attend all class sessions and to participate actively
in class discussions. Chronic absence-missing 20% or more of the class
sessions- will result in a significant lowering of your final course grade by
10%.

**

Grades:** You will be expected to complete two exams and several writing
assignments. These assignments have been designed using principles of writing
across the curriculum. Some of them are short, in-class essays, others require
that you produce on-line writing with a classmate; and one will be an in-class
group writing assignment. These essays are a part of your course work and will
be grade. You may substitute participation in a group oral report for one part
of the final exam. Your performance will be assessed on the following scale:

Midterm 25%

WAC essays 25%

Final exam 40%

Class participation 10%

Grade Scale

A+ = 100-98 B+ = 89-88 C+ =79-78 D+ = 69-68 F= 59 and below

A = 97-94 B = 87- 84 C = 77-74 D + =67-64

A- = 93- 90 B- = 83-80 C-+ 73-70 D- = 63-60

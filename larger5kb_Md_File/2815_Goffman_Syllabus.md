### Description:

This course not only fulfills both Honors College and University requirements
in General Studies, but also may be used to realize a requisite for History
minors and majors. It strives to expose the student to "non-western" regions
of the world, and explores the rich diversity within and between cultures,
economies, histories, politics, and societies. Principally through the use of
postcolonial novels, the course emphasizes in particular the historical
aspects of particular topics (monotheisms, patriarchies, world economies,
nations and minorities, coming of age) and regions (East Asia, the Indian
subcontinent, sub-Saharan Africa, and the southwestern and southeastern Asian
littorals). We might envision this as a two-track approach that strives to
meld the disciplines of fictional literature and non-fictional histories.  
  
  

### Goals:

Our most fundamental goal will be to foster tolerance and sensitivity towards
others by studying particular histories and societies. In our global economy,
other peoples loom increasingly prominent in the public lives of Americans.
Yet we reputedly are woefully unprepared to learn about and communicate with
either the unique or the widespread issues and problems with which other
peoples and societies much contend. As the world becomes ever smaller, such
ignorance becomes decreasingly viable and at times even dangerous.  
  
A related goal is to approach cross-cultural and global issues, especially
those which most influence us, critically and intelligently. Thus, our
readings and writings will focus on topics that elucidate and differentiate
the patterns of thought and values of those with whom Americans share the
world. Such a venture should also help us critique and determine our own ideas
and values.  
  
Our novels and memoirs will serve as the foundation for these endeavors. They
are an immensely diverse collection, ranging spatially from southern India to
southern California and temporally from the sixteenth to the late-twentieth
centuries. They also have much in common. They all are written by authors who
inhabit more than one cultural universe, and are about connections and
communications between peoples and societies. Consequently, each in its own
way should further our goal of becoming more aware of and intellectually
sensitive to the interdependencies between and uniquenesses of societies and
peoples. In addition, all our readings are in a sense cross-disciplinary. Each
should encourage us not only to think historically but also to integrate into
our discussions and writings techniques from disciplines such as anthropology,
comparative religions, and literary criticism. Our assignments and classroom
activities are designed to help us actively use the materials we learn so that
we all can participate in the learning process. Informal lectures, frequent
discussions, and short weekly writing assignments are meant to help us think
concretely and specifically about our readings and to look for problems and
solutions. Flexibility in writing topics sets out to encourage students to
write and think creatively about topics that interest them. Informal student
presentations are designed to encourage students to develop their own talents.  
  
  

### Requirements

There will be one mid-term and one final examination. The first will be worth
fifteen percent and the second twenty-five percent of your final grade. Three
one-thousand-word essays on three of our eight novels will be worth fifteen
percent each. Rough drafts of these essays are urged, but not required. A
short in-class presentation will be worth five percent. Quizzes over readings,
intended to generate class discussion, will be worth approximately ten percent
and will **always** be announced in advance.  

  * Examination I          15 percent 
  * Examination II          25 percent 
  * Three Essays          45 percent 
  * Presentation          5 percent 
  * Quizzes          10 percent 
  * **Total:**           100 percent 
A student who earns 100-94 percent of the total will earn an A, 93-90 will
earn an A-, 89-88 will earn a B+, 87-84 will earn a B, 83-80 will earn a B-,
79-78 will earn a C+, 77-74 will earn a C, 73-70 will earn a C-, 69-68 will
earn a D+, 67-64 will earn a D, and 63-60 will receive a D-. A failing grade
is a total of less than 60 percent.  
  
  

### Attendance and Make-ups

Although no grade points have been assigned for attendance, attendance **is**
mandatory. This course is designed with lectures and discussion that
complement, but do not repeat, our texts. In other words, **lectures contain
much material that is not in the readings**. The student is equally
responsible for in-class materials and readings. Make-up examinations and
quizzes will be given **only** with a valid excuse (illness requiring medical
care, crisis in immediate family, official university function) about which I
was informed **in advance**.  
  
If you need course adaptations or accommodations because of a disability, if
you have emergency medical information to share with me, or if you need
special arrangements in case the building must be evacuated, please make an
appointment with me as soon as possible.

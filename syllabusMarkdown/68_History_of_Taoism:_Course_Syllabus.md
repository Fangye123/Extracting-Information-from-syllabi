**Objectives:** The objective of this course is to increase our understanding
of the history, texts and religious traditions of Taoism. This will involve
introducing the philosophical texts, scripture, liturgy, and practice of
China's only indigenous religion. Since no religion develops in a void, the
context and setting for the growth of Taoism will be a major focus of the
class. The scope of the course will be generally historical and chronological,
accommodating excursions into the related realms of Chinese philosophy,
literature, and art.

  
**Language:** Knowledge of Chinese is not a requirement for students taking
this course. All lectures are in English, so it is much more important to have
a firm command of English to be able to read well, to write clearly, and to
carry on oral discussion. For the benefit of students who know or are studying
Chinese, the Chinese logographs for names and important terms and concepts
will be provided.

  
**Course Requirements:**  
** Attendance** : Attandance is manditory, especially for the highly
compressed Spring Term. If you are ill, please notify me via email or phone of
your absence. You are responsible for the material and any assignments
regardless of whether you were in a given class meeting or not. Any extended
absence (two or more consecutive meetings) must be reported to me as soon as
possible.  
  
** Particpation/Discussion:** Every student is expected to actively
participate in the discussion of the assigned readings. Students who do not
actively participate in class discussion will not fare well in the course.  
  
** Quizzes:** There will be three quizzes over the course of the semester.
Each will count 20% of the final grade. The first two exams will be taken in
the Testing Center; the third will be taken in class during the Final Exam
period.  
  
** Term Paper:** One (1) ten-page research paper on a topic related to
Taoism. You may select your own topic, however it must be approved by me in
advance. A list of suggested topics and bibliographic resources will be
provided. 40% of final grade.  
  
**Required Readings:** The required readings, which will form the basis of
class lectures and discussions, are:

>  
>   Chuang Tzu. _Basic Writings_. Burton Watson, trans. New York: Columbia
University Press, 1996.  
>   Kohn, Livia. _The Taoist Experience_. Albany: SUNY Press, 1993.  
>   Kohn, Livia. _Daoism and Chinese Culture_. Boston: Three Pines Press,
2001.  
>   Lao Tzu. _Tao-Te Ching_. D.C. Lau, trans. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1985.  
>   Photocopied packet of required supplemental reading materials.

  
**Recommended Readings:** The following book is highly recommended:

>  
>   Ebrey, Patricia. _Cambridge Illustrated History of China_. Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1996.

  
**Online Resources:** A website for this course has been set up. It will
contain a copy of the syllabus, detailed information on assignment and due
dates, links to internet resources on Taoism and related topics, and other
materials. The URL is:  
  
http://fhss.byu.edu/history/faculty/farmer/courses/350Rweb

**LEGAL & ADMINISTRIVIA**  
** Late work:** Late work will be accepted with a penalty of one letter grade
per week up to one week beyond the original due date. Work submitted later
than one week from the original due date will not be accepted and the student
will receive a grade of 0 (zero) for the assignment. However, exceptional
circumstances may be taken into account.  
  
** Honor Code:** While all students sign the honor code, there are still
specific skills most students need to master over time in order to correctly
cite sources, especially in this new age of the internet; as well as deal with
the stress and strain of college life without resorting to cheating. Please
know that as your professor I will notice instances of cheating or
plagiarizing on papers. See <http://www.byu.edu/honorcode> for specific
examples of intentional, inadvertent plagiarism, fabrication, and
falsification.  
  
** Preventing Sexual Harassment:** Title IX of the Education Amendments of
1972 prohibits sex discrimination against any participant in an educational
program or activity receiving federal funds.   The act is intended to
eliminate sex discrimination in education.  Title IX covers discrimination in
programs, admissions, activities, and student-to-student sexual harassment.
BYU's policy against sexual harassment extends not only to employees of the
university but to students as well.  If you encounter unlawful sexual
harassment or gender based discrimination, please talk to your instructor;
contact the Equal Employment Office at 378-5895 or 367-5689 (24 hours); or
contact the Honor Code Office at 378-2847.  
  
** Students with Disabilities:** Brigham Young University is committed to
providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates
qualified persons with disabilities.   If you have any disability, which may
impair your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the
Services for Students with Disabilities Office (378-2767).  Reasonable
academic accommodations are reviewed for all students who have qualified
documented disabilities.  Services are coordinated with the student and
instructor by the SSD Office.  If you need assistance or if you feel you have
been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, you may seek
resolution through established grievance policy and procedures.  You should
contact the Equal Employment Office as 378-5895, D-282 ASB.  
  
** Grading Policy:** While I do not grade on a strict curve, I am
nevertheless bound by History Department standards of grade distribution. I am
not at liberty to bestow unlimited numbers of high grades no matter how
blessed a generation you might be. Accordingly, you need to know in advance
that high numerical averages do not necessarily indicate any specific grade at
the end of the semester.

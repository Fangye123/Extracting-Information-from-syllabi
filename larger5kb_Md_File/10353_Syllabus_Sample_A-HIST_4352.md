_The Course of Mexican History_. 6th ed. New York: Oxford UP 1999, 53-544.  
  
2) Schwartz, Stuart B., ed. _Victors and Vanquished: Spanish and Nahua Views
of the Conquest_. The Bedford Series in History and Culture. New York:
Bedford, 2000, ix-x, 1-32, 38-74, 79-114, 119-213, 245-248.  
  
3) Navarro, Marysa and Virginia Sanchez Karrol, with Kecia Ali. _Women in
Latin America and the Caribbean._ Restoring Women to History Series.

b. The student will view the following, both of which are available on reserve
at The Scarborough Phillips Library:  1) _Columbus and the Age of Discovery_ ,
part entitled "The Sword and the Cross," Elll.C651991. Start at 19 minutes on
counter and go to 56 minutes. 2) _Mexico: Revolution: 1910-1940 - Part I_ ,
F1235.M4, a 58-minute video (On Reserve).  **3. Learning Activities and Course
Requirements ** The student will:  a. actively participate in six discussions
on the reading materials. Students will be given study questions and an
assignment sheet for each discussion. To aid in the learning process, the
student should write **_short_** handwritten or typed answers to the
questions. **_These should be in the student's own words and may even be in
outline form_**. Two sets of answers from assignments #2-6 will be collected
and graded by the instructor. (This will be graded on content, not grammar or
spelling.) Otherwise, students will be graded on their oral responses to the
questions, except in cases where a student wishes to turn in written responses
to enhance his/her oral performance. Some questions are thought questions for
which there are no right or wrong answers. For these, the student should be
able to explain his/her answer. In addition, I would like each student to
formulate one question related to the assignment to share with the class. A
student may stay after the discussion period to find out his/her score. **If a
student misses a class session, s/he must make up the discussion either orally
or in writing**. **Unless there are extenuating circumstances which are
discussed with the instructor, a student may not make up more than one
absence.**  
  
b. Immediately after viewing each required video, the student will spend 15-20
minutes writing answers to the following questions:  1) What is your reaction
to this video?  
2) Summarize the five or six most important things you learned from it.  
3) How does the video's treatment compare/contrast to what you have read?  
4) What questions do you have as a result of viewing this video?  This is
another "informal writing" assignment to be graded on content, not grammar or
spelling.  
  
c. Write a 5-8 page double-spaced "formal paper" (graded on content, spelling,
grammar) about the conquest period. This paper should be divided into four
sections, the first three of which should be written in the form of a diary or
journal. You may use the reading materials for inspiration, but write this in
your own words.  **In the _first section_** , you are an _Aztec (Mexica)
warrior_ describing your impressions of Cortes, the conquistadors, the
Catholic religion, _La Noche Triste_ and the final battle for Tenochtitlan, as
well as the reasons why the Spaniards were able to conquer you.  **In the
_second section_** , you are a _conquistador_. You describe your first
impressions of the Aztecs (Mexica), your journey inland to Tenochtitlan, and
your thoughts as you saw Tenochtitlan for the first time. You should describe
Montezuma, the Aztec (Mexica) religion, the class divisions and daily life of
the Aztecs (Mexica) at Tenochtitlan, _La Noche Triste_ and the final battle
for Tenochtitlan, as well as the reasons why you think you were able to defeat
the Aztecs.  **In the _third section_ ,** you are a _warrior from Tlaxcala_.
You describe your impressions of the Spaniards and the Aztecs (Mexica), and
the reasons why you joined the Spaniards. In addition, you describe why the
Tlaxcalans and the Spaniards were victorious over the Aztecs. **In the
_fourth_ section,** you are a _historian_ who has been hired to write a short
article exploring the _similarities_ between Aztec (Mexica) and Spanish
societies at the time of the conquest. You need not use any additional sources
other than those you were required to read; but like any reputable historian,
you _always cite your source_ name and page number when taking any unique
ideas or quotes from those materials.  
d. 1) Collect at least four journal/newspaper articles which in some way
relate to this course. You may find articles in newspapers or journals /
online. For each article, the student should write a 1/2 to 1 page summary of
the author's main point(s), how this article relates to what he/she has
learned in this course, and why he/she agrees or disagrees with the author.
This is an "informal writing" assignment graded on content. An article with
summary is due with assignments #3-6.  _

OR

_ 2) _ Service Learning option_:  Contact instructor if you would like to do a
brief "service learning" project. This would entail a few hours of work at
_Manos de Cristo_ , a social service agency. You would assist a recent Mexican
immigrant to learn English, how to do grocery shopping, banking, etc. You
would report orally to class, and write a short report answering the following
questions:

> > > > \- What did you do at _Manos de Cristo_?  
>  \- To whom were you assigned?  
>  \- How long has s/he been in the U.S.?  
>  \- Why did s/he leave Mexico?  
>  \- What is his/her profession?  
>  \- Describe four or five things that you learned about Mexican
history/culture from your service project.  
>  -If you had to do this project again, what would you do differently?

e. Read a short article ( _not_ from an encyclopedia) about an important
person in Mexican History who is mentioned in the textbook. At the fifth(5th)
discussion meeting, students will do a simulation,  "becoming" the personage
about whom they researched. Each student will present oral clues and the other
students will have to guess who the student has "become". This does not have
to be written, but I will need the bibliographic citation of your article.  
  
f. Write an essay response to a take-home quiz.  **4. Evaluation ** A. Letter
grade will be determined as follows:

> > > > > > Discussions with the instructor 48 points  
>  Answers to questions on videos 9 points  
>  Paper on conquest 20 points  
>  Newspaper Articles/Service Learning 8 points  
>  Simulation + Citation 5 points  
>  1 Question Quiz 10 points

> > > > > > B. A = 90-100 points - The student's papers and oral participation
are _outstanding_ in meeting assignment guidelines and demonstrates
_exceptional_ understanding of Mexican history.  
B = 80-89 points - The student's papers and oral participation are _very good_
in meeting assignment guidelines and demonstrates an _above average_
understanding of Mexican history. (Some short assignments may be missing as
long as the student has earned at least 80 points).  
C = 70-79 points - The student's papers and oral participation are _adequate_
in meeting assignment guidelines and demonstrates an _average_ understanding
of Mexican history. (Some assignments may be missing, but the student must
complete the conquest paper and quiz, as well as all discussion assignments).  
D = 60-69 points - The student's papers and oral participation are
_inadequate_ in meeting assignment guidelines and demonstrates a _below
average_ understanding of Mexican history.  
F = Below 60% - The student's papers and oral participation are _poor_ in
meeting assignment guidelines and demonstrate _little_ understanding of
Mexican history.  **  
*Plagiarism or academic dishonesty of any sort will result in an "F" for the course. See _Student Handbook_.**

**_SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES_** If you have a medical, psychiatric or learning
disability and require accommodations in this class, please let me know early
in the semester or as soon as you are eligible for accommodations. You will
first need to provide documentation of your disability to the Disability

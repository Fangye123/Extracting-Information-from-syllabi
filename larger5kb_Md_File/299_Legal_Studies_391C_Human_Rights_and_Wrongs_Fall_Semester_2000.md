Welcome to the course website for Legal Studies 391C! This course will next be
offered in the fall of 2002. This front page of the site includes an overview
of the class, some announcements and some links for further research. The
[syllabus](page3.html) and [requirements](page2.html) for this class are on
other pages of the site, and can be accessed by the links directly above on
the left. The class Web discussion group/newsgroup can be accessed
[here](http://mantle.sbs.umass.edu:8080/%7ehumanrights).  
  
**OVERVIEW:** The century that recently ended included major global efforts to
define and protect fundamental individual and group rights, along with some of
the most brutal violations in recorded history of these rights. This course
considers both of these sides of contemporary world politics. After an
introduction to the idea of human rights, we will look together at how
individuals and institutions have tried to limit the ways that (mostly)
national governments have hurt and continue to hurt people subject to their
power. My intention is to give you background in both the theory of
humanitarian law and politics and in some of the most important contemporary
issues and locations that illustrate this theory. I will conduct this class
with as much discussion and participation from you as possible. This means
that **you must come to class prepared to discuss the assigned readings for
that class.**  
  
**ANNOUNCEMENTS** : (Site last updated on 4/26/01)

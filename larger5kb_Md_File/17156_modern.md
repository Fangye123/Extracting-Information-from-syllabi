Modernism Journal Assignment

(Spring 2001: Note that we will NOT have class on Monday [2/9]. We will
briefly discuss modernism and spend most of the hour discussing Frost at on
2/12.)

(Note: you may also like to know that the questions below are based more upon
another modernism essay than upon the one in your text. Nonetheless, you are
responsible for reading the assignment in your text and for knowing the
material addressed below.)

Reading: **Modern Period: 1910-1945 (883-914).

**

  1. Journal Questions:
**

      1. One of the central characteristics of "modernism" is an anxiety caused by a fear that society was in a state of rapid decay. Based on the section "Life and Thought Between the Wars," explain how each of the following cultural forces would have contributed to this sense of anxiety and/or social decay
_

World War 1_ : **brutality and number of deaths from enemy fire and disease
resulted in the sense of a "great civilization being destroyed or destroying
itself, of social breakdown, and of individual powerlessness ...with resulting
feelings of fear, disorientation, and on occasion, liberation...an old order
had ended" (939)

**_

Communication Technology_ : **(especially radio and newspapers) created "mass"
culture bringing _decay_ by displacing "high" and "folk" culture (940)

**_

Automobile_ : **"lack of tradition, rootlessness" = form of decay of
traditional, immobile, rooted society (940)

**_

Science_ : **Einstein's theory of relativity; Heisenberg's uncertainty
principle, and Bohr's quantum mechanics spread a sense among the masses (and
artists) that "scientists saw less certainty and more chance in the universe
than had nineteenth-century science, whose procedures of labeling and
classifying had assumed stability in nature. Distinctions between matter and
energy, between observer and observed, and between time and space were
blurred. ( _Decay of certainty and boundaries_ ) (941)

**_

Freud_ : **posited a theory of "the self as grounded in an 'unconscious' that
controlled a great deal of overt behavior. Hidden in this unconscious were
experiences that one had repressed: traumas, forbidden desires, unacceptable
emotions--most of these of a sexual nature and many deriving from earliest
childhood.... In popularized form, these ideas were extended to support the
relaxation of sexual mores as well as permissiveness in childrearing, and they
underlay the larger trend toward openness and informality in American
behavior" (942) ( _Decay in control of the self , in sexual morality, and in
formality of behavior_ ).

**_

Marx_ : **For Marx the "root cause of all behavior was economic...the division
of society into antagonistic classes was based on a relation to the means of
production. The ideas and ideals of any particular society represented the
interests of its dominant class.... For Marx people were controlled by forces
outside the self...a kind of determinism that ... [was] counter to long-
standing American beliefs in free will and free choice" (942) ( _Decay in
purity of motivation from idealistic to materialistic + Decay in human freedom
of will and choice.)

**_

      2. What additional item would the modernist _male_ writers (e.g., Pound, Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Williams, and Eliot) add to the above list of anxiety-producing forces of social decay? **New Woman whose "advances" in the areas of education, jobs, politics (right to vote), self-expression, and sexuality were viewed by many as a sign of decay. Certainly these forms of expansion in women's roles represented the "decay" of the cult of true womanhood. The New Woman definitely seemed less pious, pure, domestic, and submissive. (941)
**

      3. In spite of the advances made by the New Woman, what remained the two chief goals of the great majority of women throughout the 1920's? **to marry and build a family (941).
**

      4. Name some of the advantages and disadvantages of the great migration of African-Americans to Northern urban centers during the 1910's and 1920's. **Although this migration helped blacks escape the racism of the South and allowed many African-Americans to earn real wages for the first time, the available jobs were at the bottom of the wage scale (meaning little relief from poverty), blacks also faced segregated neighborhoods and segregated schools in the north, and found a less overt, but still present form of racism in Northern Whites. (941)
**

      5. What generalizations can be made about literature from the following three periods?
_

Before WW1_ : **"reflected a sense of society as something stable, whose
repetitions and predictability enabled one to chronicle a universal human
situation through accurate representation of particulars" (944)

**_

Between WW1 and WW2_ : **"attempted to convey a vision of social decay through
appropriate techniques or offered radical critiques of American society on
behalf of working people or tried to develop a conservative literature that
could counter social breakdown" (944)

**_

After WW2_ : **"tended to lack faith that literature could reflect _any_
reality, even a disintegrating one; they also had much less confidence in
literary art than did writers working in the 1920's and 30's"

**

      6. Some of you are focusing on the theme of religion this semester. What sort of "religion" or "faith" did the writers from the following periods seem to have?
_

Before WW1_ : **"had faith in society and in art" (944)

**_

Between WW1 and WW2_ : **"had faith in art [alone]" (944)

**_

After WW2_ : **seemed to have no faith in society or in the power of art to
represent the disintegration of society (944)

**_

      7. Look up the term "aesthetics" in the dictionary and record the definition in your journal_. 
      8. What conviction lay at the heart of the "modern aesthetic"? **That the previously sustaining structures of human life, whether social, political, religious, or artistic, had been either destroyed or shown up as falsehoods or fantasies (944).
**

      9. Why were "order, sequence, and unity in works of art" considered suspect by modernists? **Because these might be considered only expressions of a desire for coherence rather than actual reflections of reality (944)
**_

      10. Based on your answer to question 9, what can you assume modernists thought should be the content of good literature? What should literature try to do_? 
      11. What were the two main characteristics of reality according to the modernist experience? **Flux and fragmentation (944).
**

      12. What has been called the "defining _formal_ characteristic of the modernist work"? **its construction out of fragments. (944)
**

      13. Why do modernist texts typically omit the following traditional elements: explanations, interpretations, summaries and distancing? **Because these elements would provide (what modernists might view as a FALSE) sense of continuity, perspective, and security. (944)
**

      14. What sort of quest is at the center of most modernist texts? **(quest for coherence and/or meaning)
**

      15. If one looks up the term "subjective" in the dictionary, at least two different definitions may be found. One of these definitions ("expressing or bringing into prominence the individuality of the artist or author") seems to have a positive connotation; a second definition ("existing only within the experiencer's mind and incapable of external verification") often has a negative connotation. Keep these two definitions in mind when answering the following question. Why was "subjectivity" "ever more valued" in modernist literature? **because the stable external world was being questioned, or thought to have been proven non-existent (945)
**

      16. What forms of non-traditional language did modernists include in their literature? **Speech of the uneducated and the inarticulate, the colloquial, slangy, and the popular (945)
**

      17. What sort of prose did modernist writers strive to produce? **Direct, compressed, and vivid (945)
**

      18. How did the modernist prose writers use point of view to convey the importance of subjectivity or their belief in the "reality of confusion rather than the myth of certainty"? **Tended to write in the first person or to limit the reader to one character's point of view on the action.... The selected point of view was often that of a na ive or marginal person--child or outsider--so as to convey better the reality of confusion rather than the myth of certainty. (946)
**

      19. Give both a negative and positive definition of "truth" from the modernist perspective. **they believed that "truth" does _not_ exist objectively but _is_ the product of a personal interaction with reality.** (246)
      20. What is menat when "pure" modernists (such as Stein, Pound, H.D. and Eliot) are labeled as "expatriates"? **Lived outside the U.S. (246)
**

      21. What additional label might be given to those _non-pure modernists_ who remained in the U.S. and associated themselves closely with a specific area of the country? **Regionalists** Name some of the writers from your syllabus which fall into this category? **Anderson, Cather, Robinson, Frost, and Faulkner.
**

      22. Based upon all knowledge you have gathered about modernism so far, compile a list of characteristic traits of modernist writing. (Remember that not all modernist texts will have all of these traits.)

**

Anxiety

Experimentation

Alienation

Irony

Flux

Elitist: intentionally difficult, esoteric, priviledged

Religion: often the underlying philosophy presupposes the death of faith or
God.

Quest for meaning/coherence = central theme

Emphasis on subjectivity (the self as prism through which all knowledge must
pass; the self  as final judge of what is real, true, valuable).

Fragmentation

Omission of explanations, interpretations, summaries and distancing

Subject: often is art or process of creating art itself.

Symbols + Concrete Images (used to suggest rather than declare)

Allusions (used to refer to lost coherence of the past)

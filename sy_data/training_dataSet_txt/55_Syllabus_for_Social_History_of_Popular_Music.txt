Course Description
This course is organized around reading about and discussing the social
history of twentieth century American popular music. The goal of the course
is to explore important themes in American social and cultural history
through the study of popular music. During the semester students will critically
analyze the influence of technology, ideology, class, gender, and race
on various genres of music -- jazz, country, rhythm and blues, rock and
hip hop.  Emphasis will be placed on understanding the social and
cultural contexts of the various music forms rather than on a rigorous
understanding of the musical forms themselves. No musical background or
skills will be expected of students in the course. (In other words, the
course is a history course, not a music course.) 
Classes will operate in a discussion format, with brief lectures/comments
introducing the various weekly themes. In addition to participating in
class discussion, each student will prepare and deliver a 20 minute class
presentation.  On the day of their presentation, each student will
submit a 7 page essay derived from their presentation. The major assignment
for the course is a 20 page research essay, due in the History Department
office on APRIL 30, 2002 AT 4PM.  In the closing weeks
of the semester, each student will be requested to deliver a brief presentation
on the topic of her/his research.  The topic for your research essay
may include a study of a specific genre of or theme in 20th century popular
music.  You may discuss the influences on, events related to, and
impact of the genre or theme that you select. Or you may submit an "annotated
compilation" which provides an organized history of the evolution and larger
cultural/social significance of the genre in question as well as a list
of appropriate musical examples of the genre. The aim of the research project
is to encourage each student to apply in a creative manner some of the
critical ideas developed in the class to an important genre of music or
theme in the history of 20th century American music.

Students are required to do the assigned reading and come to class prepared

Class discussion is the essential mode of instruction in this course. Students
are expected to participate actively in discussion and to respect the ideas
of all participants.  If you have difficulty participating in seminar
discussion, please discuss your inhibitions with me.  Remember, I
want to know your ideas but I can't read your mind.

may be granted, but only as circumstances warrant. Late assignments will
be penalized 1/3 of a letter grade day.

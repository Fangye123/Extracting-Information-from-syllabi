**Political Science 322: Public Opinion and Public Policy  
Professor Palazzolo  
PS 206 (9:20 and 11:30)  
Spring 1999**

This course deals with the fundamental relationship between public opinions
and public policy decisions. How is public opinion formed and communicated?
How does it influence public policy? How do elites affect public opinion? What
structures and institutions mitigate or facilitate the influence of public
opinion on public policy? What should be the proper role of public opinion in
a republican form of government?

Preparation and Participation (10%)

Papers and exams will be graded on the basis of content as well as writing
(i.e. organization, clarity, precision, and technical presentation). Please
consult the handout "How to Write an A Paper" for detailed guidelines of my
expectations for written assignments. One might refer to the Writing Center
for additional assistance with writing assignments.  
I do not grade on a curve; each student is evaluated on his or her
performance. A ten-point scale with letter grades from "A" to "F," including
pluses and minuses, will be applied for each assignment as well as the final
course grade. A grade in the A range (100-90) is "excellent," B (89-80)
"good," C (79-70) "average", D (69-60) "below average," and F (59 or below)
"failing." I do not allow additional work for extra credit. Every student will
have ample opportunities to make a grade and I will be happy to discuss your
progress at any time during the semester.  
Everyone is expected to read and to be prepared to discuss the readings for
each class period specified on the syllabus, unless I change the schedule.
Participation is not simply a matter of raising one's hand early and often.
The quality of participation, making good observations based on sound analysis
and reference to assigned readings, is just as important as the frequency of
comments made in class.



ATTENDANCE AND LATE POLICY  
Students are expected to attend every class period. I will take attendance,
and attendance records will affect participation/preparation grades. Papers
are due at the beginning of class on the dates marked on the syllabus and
assignment sheets. Any paper that arrives after the time and date specified on
the assignment sheet will suffer a full grade deduction per day. Any project
submitted 72 hours or more after the time specified on the assignment sheet
will receive a failing grade. You should still hand in a paper even if the
grade will be an F because half credit is better than none in terms of the
final course grade.  
Having said that, keep in mind that I am quite flexible in cases of emergency.
Please contact me if special circumstances prevent you from completing class
work on time. Emergencies, however, do not include: weekend trips, social
engagements, extracurricular activities, or the infamous "work overdose"
syndrome. (Incidentally, years of experience have taught me only a few
students will turn in papers late. The overwhelming majority complete
assignments on time.)  
Let me be crystal clear: no one is entitled to "slack" for reasons other than
illness, family emergency, or other substantial personal trauma. The due dates
for assignments are clearly established well ahead of time.  
OFFICE HOURS  
I am available for consultation on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from
10:15-11:15 AM, or by appointment (Political Science Building, Room 114).
Appointments can be made after class, by telephone at 289-8973, or via e-mail
(dpalazzo@richmond.edu).

ASTRONOMY 236 - A Brief History of Matter in the Universe
SPRING 2002

Time
and Place:
T, Th 9:30-10:45 in 6515 Sterling Hall

Web
Page:
www.astro.wisc.edu/~ewilcots/astro236

Instructor:
Professor Eric M. Wilcots
5524
Sterling Hall
262-2364
ewilcots@astro.wisc.edu

Office
Hours:
T,Th 11-12, or by appointment

Texts:
The only required text is Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great
Science Writing, editied by Edmund Blair Bolles.I
will also hand out a number of articles in class throughout the semester,
and these will also be required reading.There
will be a number of supplementary texts held on reserve in the Astronomy
library and/or in the Physics library (the Astronomy library has limited
hours).These include: Geochemistry
(Arthur H. Brownlow), Astronomy & Astrophysics (Michael Zeilik
& Stephen A. Gregory), Moons and Planets (William K. Hartmann),
and Introduction to Geochemistry (Konrad B. Krauskopf & Dennis
K. Bird).You should consider these
texts to be resources to get a bit more information or at least a different
perspective from what is presented in class.They
may also serve as reference material for some of the writing assignments.The
course content will largely be contained in lecture material, the Bolles
book, and the articles handed out in class.

Writing
in Astronomy 236:

As
you know this course fulfills the University's Communications-B requirement.The
rules and regulations of such courses are that the students turn in at
least 30 pages of writing over the course of the semester.This
includes drafts that get reviewed by the instructor.The
course assignments are designed to fulfill the requirements of the Comm-B
designation while improving your compositional skills and enhancing your
knowledge of the history of matter in the Universe.The
readings and writing assignments are also designed to introduce you to
a variety of different styles of scientific writing.There
will be four major writing assignments 

Writing
Fellows:

This
course takes advantage of the Student Writing Fellow Program.Writing
Fellows are competitively chosen undergraduates who help students develop
their writing skills.They are trained
in how to critically evaluate writing and respond helpfully, and they will
work with you individually outside of class to help you improve the clarity
and effectiveness of your writing.But,
Writing Fellows do not grade your papers or teach you course-specific
content. 

Here?s
how it works.The Writing Fellows
will work with you on two different assignments.In
each case you will submit a polished draft of your paper to me on the assigned
due date.I will pass it along to
the Writing Fellows who will carefully read your paper, make comments on
your draft, and then meet with you individually for a conference to discuss
your writing and suggestions for revision.These
conferences are required.You will
then revise your paper and submit both the original draft and the revised
version on the specified revision due date.Please
include a cover letter briefly explaining how you responded to each of
your Writing Fellow?s comments.

A
?polished draft? represents your best effort at the assignment.They
should be double-spaced and have a complete set of references.It
is of quality comparable to what you would turn in for grading.Polished
drafts are not outlines, rough drafts, or even a first draft.Proofread
carefully to remove any grammatical errors.

We?ll
be using the writing fellows on the 1st and 4th assignments of the semester.

Writing
Assignments:

Writing Assignment #1 - "Public Opinion".This
assignment is based (in part) on a true story.Assume
that the State Board of Education votes that students will no longer be
responsible for learning about the Big Bang because "its not real science"
and its "just a theory."Your job
is to write an op-ed piece for the newspaper arguing for or against the
Board's position.Your response
should clearly state what science is, how the development of our understanding
of the Big Bang fits or does not fit that definition.You
should also review the body of knowledge and how it either does or does
not support the Big Bang.Your positions
should be clearly supported with references.Remember
that your audience is the general public that would read the newspaper
and you don't know whether or not they will support the Board's decision.

Your paper should be 3-4 pages long.


Writing Assignment #2 - "Writing for non-Scientists".Pick
a topic covered in this course an write an article on the topic for a popular
magazine.Feel free to pick a topic
we have not yet discussed.Assume
your audience to be college-educated, but not scientific (all those English
majors running around out there).You
will be assessed on the content and the effectiveness of reaching the targeted
audience.The length should be 5
pages.If you?ve written less than
4, you need more content.If you've
written more than 6, you're probably be too verbose.I'll
have a list of suggested topics once the time gets closer.


Writing Assignment #3 - "Writing for the
Journals".We have a week long lab
exercise in this course which will probably concentrate on the analysis
of the composition of a sample of rocks and minerals.Your
assignment is to do the lab and write up your results as if you were writing
for a scientific journal such as Science or Nature.Remember
that your audience will be other scientists.The
paper should about 3-4 pages long.


Writing Assignment #4 - "The Proposal".Academics
spend huge amounts of time writing proposals, the most significant of which
request funding from the Federal government to support our scientific research.Astronomers,
geologists, physicists, and chemists get a good deal of their support from
the National Science Foundation.The
heart of any proposal is the research statement, a document that effectively
demonstrates the author?s familiarity with their area of research, and
poses and justifies, in a persuasive manner, a question or series of questions
to be answered by the funded research.The
questions should, of course, be important to furthering our understanding
of the specific field.The statement
then goes on to clearly explain how the research will answer the questions
raised in the proposal.Your assignment
is to write the research statement of a proposal to the National Science
Foundation.You may chose your own
topic, but it must be closely related to the course content and it must
be approved by me in advance.You
are limited to 8 pages, and keep in mind that it will be difficult to write
a good proposal in less than 5-6 pages.You
should concentrate on: demonstrating your knowledge of the subject (call
this part review), understanding what the important unanswered questions
are and why they are important, and giving an overview of how we might
go about answering the questions.About
half of the paper should be review, another third should be the identification
of the unanswered questions and the last bit should be how you?d try to
answer the questions.

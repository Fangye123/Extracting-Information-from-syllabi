### History 536  
History of Russia to 1725



This course is the first of a four-quarter, upper-division survey of Russian
history. The first quarter covers the period from the ninth century through
the reign of Peter the Great. The course will emphasize selected topics in
social, religious, cultural, intellectual, and institutional history rather
than political narrative. Students will strive to develop facility in
analyzing primary sources (in translation) and evaluating historical
interpretations.

There are no formal prerequisites for this course, but it is intended for
junior and senior majors in the History or Slavic Departments. Graduate
students from outside the History Department may also enroll. Students lacking
background in Russian history are strongly advised to obtain a textbook and
familiarize themselves with historical narrative and major issues within the
first week of the quarter. Class meetings will consist primarily of
discussion.

**Course requirements:**

All students must register for this course at the beginning of the quarter.
According to Departmental policy, prompt enrollment is the obligation solely
of the student. The Department Chair will not approve petitions to add the
course after the second week of classes.

Students are responsible for completion of all assigned reading and all
material presented in class. Class participation is an essential part of the
course, and will be figured into the final grade.

The following written assignments are required:

    
    
         Midterm Examination    30 %
         Term Paper             30 %
         Final Examination      35 %
         Class Participation     5 %
    

The midterm and final examinations will consist of a combination of short and
long essays, based on reading and class discussions.

The term paper will be an essay analyzing _The Domostroi_ in the context of
other assigned readings and class discussions. This essay should survey the
issues and differing historical interpretations, and be accompanied by an
annotated bibliography of the pertinent primary and secondary sources. Further
information on these paper assignments is appended to this syllabus.

Because history is conveyed verbally, the quality of the English prose is an
important factor is determination of the grade. Papers should be written in
formal, grammatical English. Sentence fragments, spelling mistakes, misplaced
modifiers, faulty punctuation, and colloquialisms (among other stylistic
errors) all distract and confuse the reader. Consequently, papers containing
an excessive number of these mistakes will be graded down by as much as two
full letter grades. Students who anticipate difficulties in producing error-
free papers are urged to contact the Writing Center at the beginning of the
quarter.

Make-up exams and extensions are granted at the discretion of the instructor
to those students presenting valid and verifiable excuses. Students who are
unable to take examinations or hand in papers as scheduled for family,
religious, and medical reasons _must_ contact the instructor by the due date
for the assignment. Work which is received late without just cause or without
a previously approved excuse may be graded down by a full letter per day late.
The pressures of other course work, employment, and extra-curricular
activities do not constitute valid excuses for late assignments. If the
instructor is not available to approve excuses, leave a message in the History
Department (106 Dulles Hall, 292-2674), which is open from 8:00-5:00 on
weekdays. There is no provision in this course for additional papers for extra
credit or to substitute for requirements.

A student who wishes reconsideration of the grade on an examination or paper
should submit it in its entirety to the instructor. The paper should be
accompanied by a _written_ exposition, explaining why, in the student's
opinion, the grade is not an accurate appraisal of the work. Appeals must be
initiated within one week after the papers were returned to the class. In the
course of reviewing a paper or exam on appeal, the instructor may raise the
grade, confirm it, or lower it.

**TERM PAPER ASSIGNMENT**

Primary sources lie at the base of any valid historical interpretation.
Historians recognize that sources contain both the essential information from
which to reconstruct the past and mistakes and biases that distort it. They
learn how to read primary sources critically, to uncover both the ideals they
promote and the reality they both reveal and disguise. _The Domostroi_ , a
manual for household management, contains a wealth of information about daily
life and the normative values that shaped it.

Your assignment is to write a paper examining one of the following topics--or
an approved topic of your own choosing--using _The Domostroi_ as your major
source.

  1. Describe the religious life of lay people. What religious observances did they keep? What kind of conduct did their religious principles require? What non-Christian behaviors were Muscovites instructed to avoid? 
  2. Describe the hierarchy in the Muscovite household. What places did husbands, wives, children, and servants have in it? What were the duties and expectations of each? 
  3. Describe the economy of the Muscovite household. What were the sources of income (in money and in kind) and what kinds of expenditures were made? What fiscal and management problems did the household face, and how could they be avoided? 
  4. How does _The Domostroi_ describe the relationship between the household and the outside world? What should good household managers do to bring prosperity and honor to their family? 

In addition to _The Domostroi_ , draw upon the other materials (both primary
and secondary sources) assigned for this course. If you wish, you may
undertake additional library research; the bibliography to _The Domostroi_
contains many worthwhile publications in English. Be forewarned: there are
some badly researched publications about Muscovy, so be sure to check with the
instructor before relying heavily on something you stumble upon. Also,
understand that further reading in secondary sources will not substitute for a
thorough analysis of _The Domostroi_.

Style matters a great deal in paper-writing. Organize your material carefully,
so that you make a coherent and convincing statement. Begin with an
introduction that states your topic and indicates your slant on it. In the
body of the paper, balance factual data and interpretation. A good rule of
thumb: for each generalization, provide at least one example. For each
example, provide a passage of equal length elucidating it and setting it in
context. Expect to include numerous quotations from Domostroi and the other
primary sources assigned for this course. Use quotations from secondary
sources sparingly--only when _how_ the authors say something is as significant
as _what_ they say. Save at least one page for your conclusion, where you
summarize your findings, reflect upon their significance, and state your
interpretation.

Some words of caution: 1) Analyze _The Domostroi_ for information on attitudes
and realities in medieval Russian society-don't just summarize the text. Make
sure that your paper is more than just a string of quotations; use quotations
and paraphrases to illustrate and demonstrate _your_ ideas, which need to be
fully enunciated. 2) Expect some ambiguities: questions you can't answer,
apparent contradictions, aspects of the topic that are not discussed at all,
widely divergent interpretations. Try to create a coherent picture, even if
some issues remain unresolved. 3) Remember that you are working with a
translation. It is dangerous to build your interpretation on single words or
phrases that might be misleading. 4) Avoid value judgments. Your task is not
to decide whether medieval Russian society was good or bad, advanced or
backward, but rather to explain it.

Some instructions on format: The essay should be no more than 3,000 words--
10-12 pages double-spaced, including notes, but not including the title page.
If you use a computer, do not alter the printing norms to squeeze more text
into the same number of pages; stick to 10/12 pitch and 60 lines (average) per
page (i.e. 30 lines of text, including running headers, page numbers, and
notes). Notes should be in the same font as the text; they may be single-
spaced internally, double-spaced between notes. Provide formal footnotes or
endnotes, and a bibliography, according to the model given in a collegiate
style manual such as Turabian. You need not footnote class discussions.
Failure to cite sources of direct quotes and paraphrases is plagiarism--a
serious offense punishable under university rules. Proof-read your paper
before turning it in. A few neat corrections in ink of the printed copy are
acceptable. The title page should include your name, the course number, and
the title of your paper. _Staple_ the pages together. Take out a 75 cent
insurance policy: make a Xerox copy of your paper, and retain it until the end
of the quarter.

Note: Papers that do not adhere to format requirements will be returned,
unread, for revision.

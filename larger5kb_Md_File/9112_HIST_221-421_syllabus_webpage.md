**TTh 9:25-10:40**  
**Professor Thal**

  
  
  
  

From the Sun Goddess to samurai, images from early history continue to shape
the way Japanese people think about themselves and their country. In this
survey of Japan from prehistoric times to the eighteenth century, students
will be introduced to the major religious and intellectual traditions, social
and political formations, and cultural and economic transformations of the
Japanese islands. Special attention will be paid to the changing intellectual
frameworks through which people have interpreted their present and their past.

NOTE: Students in third-year Japanese or the equivalent may also enroll for
the one-credit LSAC (Language Study Across the Curriculum) add-on to this
class, which will meet one additional hour per week. The LSAC section will be
devoted to further reading and discussion in Japanese of material closely
related to HIST 221/421.

Requirements:  
All students will be expected to attend lectures regularly, read the assigned
texts before each class and, based on those readings, participate actively in
classroom discussions (on all days, not just designated discussion days).
There will be 2 map quizzes, 2 projects and classroom presentations (see the
syllabus, Sept. 14 and Dec. 5), a midterm exam, and a cumulative, self-
scheduled final exam. Students may write an optional film review for up to 5%
extra credit (see Nov. 16). Students enrolled in HIST 421 will be required to
submit a paper (5-8 pages, double-spaced) on a topic decided in conjunction
with the professor. Requirements for students enrolled in the LSAC (Language
Study Across the Curriculum) section will be discussed separately.  


Grades will be calculated as follows:            HIST 221                HIST

**IMPORTANT: Final grades may be adjusted (up to one full letter grade up or
down) based on attendance, evidence of having read the assigned texts, and
classroom participation.  


Policy on Late Assignments: Because the two projects also involve classroom
presentations, it is imperative that they be completed and turned in on time
-- at the beginning of class on September 14 and December 5. Quizzes and exams
must be taken at the scheduled time. Late papers for HIST 421 will be
penalized 1/3 of a grade per day (e.g., A- to B+) in fairness to the rest of
the class. See me if you have a medical or personal emergency.

Statement Regarding Disability: Students with a documented disability and in
need of academic or other adjustments should speak with me during the first
two weeks of class. All discussions will remain confidential. Students with
disabilities should also contact the office of Disabled Student Services
(phone: 713-737-5841; e-mail: adarice@rice.edu) in the Ley Student Center.

Nov 16 - NO CLASS - Papers due in my box in the History Department by 5:00.  
                HIST 421 PAPER DUE   
                Optional extra credit film review due. You have been hired to write a   
                    review of Teshigahara Hiroshi's 1989 film, Rikyu, for the forthcoming issue of   
                    the new journal, History and Film. Your review should focus on one aspect of the   
                    director's interpretation of history: for example, his portrayal of the main   
                    characters (Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and/or Sen no Rikyu), his   
                    depiction of the tea ceremony and its aesthetics, or his portrayal of the   
                    relationship between military leaders and the imperial court. Which important   
                    scenes reveal the director's interpretive stance, and how? How does his   
                    interpretation agree with and differ from the interpretations of historians (i.e., the   
                    assigned texts as well as what you have learned in class)? Why do you think   
                    Teshigahara made the interpretive decisions that he did (in the late 1980s)?   
                    (Optional: What might the film look like if it were made based on a different   
                    evaluation of people, influences, or events?) The paper should be 3-5 pages,   
                    double-spaced.

                    such as the Kodansha Encyclopedia of Japan for information on the authors and   
                    their teachers (e.g., Dazai Shundai and Ogyu Sorai). Pull the paper together with   
                    introductory and concluding paragraphs setting forth your own conclusion about

                    stance of Inagaki Hiroshi's film, Chushingura, and/or a paragraph analyzing

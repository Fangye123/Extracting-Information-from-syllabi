| **Course Description**  
This course examines the economic, political, social, and cultural history of
the United States between 1900 and 1945. Through assigned readings,
discussions, videos, and in-class "workshops," we will learn about and gain a
better understanding of the people, places, trends, and events that
transformed American life during the first half of the twentieth century. One
theme of the course will be the multi-faceted process of "modernization"
during this period, the difficulties it posed, the opportunities it offered,
and the varied responses it provoked on the part of the nation's increasingly
diverse population. Questions of class, race, gender, and ethnicity will also
inform our study of the period. Topics to be considered include:
progressivism, World War I and its effects, the cultural conflicts of the
1920s, the Great Depression, the New Deal, and World War II and its effects.  
  
**Course Objectives**  
By the end of the course, you should be able to:  
\- describe the key economic, political, social, and cultural developments of
the Progressive Era, the 1920s, the New Deal Era, and World War II;  
\- compare and contrast the economic, political, social, and cultural goals
and experiences of those of different class, gender, and racial backgrounds at
different points in time;  
\- analyze and interpret common cultural productions of the period, such as
advertisements and photographs, as historical artifacts;  
\- write an historical argument that analyzes and interprets changes in
American society between 1900 and 1945;  
\- and use primary and secondary evidence to support historical description,
interpretation, and argument.

| **Course Requirements**  
_For three-credit-hour students:_ The course requirements include three 3- to
5-page essays (15% each), a final examination that consists of identifications
and two essays (30%); and class participation in the form of informal oral
reports, active discussion, and other learning activities (25%).  
  
_For four-credit-hour students:_ The course requirements include three 3- to
5-page typewritten essays (10% each), a final examination that consists of
identifications and two essays (25%); class participation in the form of
informal oral reports, active discussion, and other learning activities (20%);
and a 15- to 20-page independent research paper or extended review essay
(25%). Students choosing this option should submit a research project or
review essay proposal by September 25, a list of sources and sketch outline by
October 16, a first draft by November 20, and a final draft by December 13.
Deadlines for the proposal, sketch outline, and first draft may be extended
upon advance consultation with the instructor. Consult the "Guidelines for the
Four-Credit-Hour Project" for more detailed instructions.  
  
_Essays:_ There will be three essays due during the course. These essays
should be 3-5 pages in length, typewritten, and well-organized. Well-organized
essays almost always consist of:  
\- an introduction (in which you describe the problem and state your thesis,
or position, on the issue at hand),  
\- a body of several paragraphs (in which you make arguments, supported by
specific examples, that support or add necessary context to your thesis), and  
\- a brief conclusion (in which you summarize your main points and restate
your thesis).  
Essay topics will be provided about a week in advance of the due date.  
  
_Final Examination:_ There will be one final, comprehensive examination in
this course at a date and time set by the university. There will be a mixture
of essay and short answer questions on the exam. Some guidance to help you
prepare for the exam will be provided. Except in cases of emergency, requests
for make-up exams should be made no less than one week before the day of the
exam. Make-ups will be granted only in instances of illness or scheduling
conflicts deemed unavoidable by the instructor. You must take the final exam
to pass the course.  
  
_Participation:_ Timely completion of all assigned readings, regular class
attendance, and active classroom participation are essential to your success
in this course. It is your responsibility to allocate enough time to complete
the assigned readings before each class. You should come to class prepared to
share your understanding of the readings, relate the readings to other aspects
of the course, and to pose your own questions about the readings. Use the
attached "Guide to Critical Reading" to help you prepare to discuss assigned
readings.

**Academic Dishonesty**  
All work submitted for this course must be the product of your own
intellectual efforts. Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism (i.e., the
presentation of another's work, dead or alive, published or unpublished, as
your own or without proper citation), is not allowed and will be penalized.
This rule also applies to content copied from web sites. Internet plagiarism
is easy to detect! A grade of zero will be assigned to any paper or exam in
which an instance of academic dishonesty is detected. The zero will then be
averaged with the other grades to determine the final grade for the course.

Students who are disabled or impaired should meet with the professor within
the first two weeks of the semester to discuss the need for any special

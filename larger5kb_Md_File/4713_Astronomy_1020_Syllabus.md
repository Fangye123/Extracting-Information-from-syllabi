Note that I will not normally be in the office on Fridays this semester, as I
will be spending most weekends in Princeton, NJ with my family. If you need to
contact me over the weekend you can call me at home at (609) 683-3834; I will
be reading my e-mail frequently on Fridays and sporadically on Saturdays and
Sundays.

Required Textbook: E. Chaisson & S. McMillan, Astronomy Today, Third Edition
(2000), Prentice Hall.

**GENERAL INFORMATION:**

Chaisson  & McMillan is an excellent text, but will not include all the
material in my lectures (and of course, I will not cover everything in the
text). Many of you might benefit from looking at texts with different
viewpoints; other excellent books are: W.J. Kaufmann, Universe and T.P. Snow,
The Dynamic Universe.

All students are expected to be familiar with the [ Policy on Academic
Honesty](http://www.gsu.edu/~wwwreg/ugcat2000/academic/honesty.htm) and to
abide by it. Cheating will certainly earn you a zero on that quiz or exam, and
the penalties can be substantially more severe.

You are expected to be considerate and respectful of other students; talking
(other than to ask questions of me) or eating in class are obvious forms of
discourtesy. Cell phones and pagers are to be turned off (or at most, set to
give tactile, rather than audible, signals) while in class.

**COURSE GOALS:**

This is the second of two introductory astronomy courses which include a
weekly laboratory. Although nearly all students taking this course will have
had ASTR 1010 already, it is not an absolute prerequisite, and the most
important material covered in 1010 that is needed for this class will be
summarized in the lectures. We will study the nature of the entire universe,
beginning with a review of properties of light, since it is only through
radiation that astronomers can gather information about stars, galaxies and
the universe as a whole. The main topics are: the Sun as a star; what we know
about stars and how we have learned it; the formation, lives and deaths of
stars, including pulsars and black holes; the nature of our Galaxy and other
galaxies; active galaxies and quasars; the distribution of matter in the
universe; the entire history of the universe (in two easy lessons). Aside from
learning a significant amount of exciting and important factual material,
comprising a summary of our best current knowledge of astronomy, students
should come away from this course with an appreciation of the techniques and
thinking styles employed by scientists when they attempt to understand what is
going on in very distant places which they cannot actually visit to perform
experiments. Quantitative reasoning will be used frequently; however, only
introductory algebra and very simple geometry will be needed.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

You are responsible for all the material in the assigned readings and in the
lectures unless you are specifically told otherwise. While attendance at every
lecture is not required, it is expected, and it will be extremely difficult
for any student to get a grade of C or better if (s)he does not attend nearly
every class. If you must miss a lecture, you should be certain to hand copy
the notes of another student as soon as possible. It is expected that a
summary of most class notes, as well as assignments and answers to assignments
will be available through[ GSU
WebCT](http://webct.gsu.edu/webct/public/home.pl?action=print_home). These
abbreviated notes will not substitute for the need to attend (and pay
attention) in class, but they will allow you to check that you have not made
significant errors in your personal notes.

You are strongly encouraged to ask questions before, during or after class} if
something is not clear. If my office hours are not convenient for you, just
make an appointment to meet with me. I strongly urge you to read the assigned
sections before the corresponding lecture. As you do so, note the points with
which you have difficulty, so that if they are not clarified during the class
you can immediately raise questions. Soon after the lecture, carefully
(re-)read the corresponding text sections to reinforce the material.

There will be three one-hour exams, and a cumulative final, which will,
however, emphasize the last portion of the course. All of the questions will
be of a short answer (true/false, multiple choice, matching, fill-in-the-
blank, etc.) variety. No more than 25% of any exam will comprise questions
involving simple mathematics. The examination questions will stress the
material covered in class, so punctual attendance and careful notetaking will
be keys to doing well; however, there will typically be a few questions asked
that are covered in the text but not the lectures, so don't neglect your
reading.

The average student will do well in this course if (s)he devotes four to six
hours a week (outside of lecture and lab) to reading the textbook and
reviewing her or his notes. Be sure to answer the questions at the end of each
chapter to test your knowledge of the material well in advance of exams.

Of course, **modifications to the above schedule may be necessary.**

**GRADING:**

Each of the three hour exams will count as 15% of your grade, and the final as
20%. Two or three pop quizzes and a few assignments will comprise a total of
10%, and your lab work will count for the remaining 25%.

There will be no make-up exams; if you miss one of the hour tests the final
will substitute for that test and will thus amount to 35% of your grade. If
you miss two of them, you'll receive a zero for one, and the final will still
contribute a maximum of 35 out of 100 points. Therefore, don't get sick on
more than one exam date. If your final exam grade is better than any or all of
your hour exam grades it will substitute for the lowest exam score. There can
be no make-up for an unannounced quiz, so missing one yields a zero.

An average grade of 90% or better guarantees an A, an average grade of at
least 80% gives a B, 70% or better yields a C, and an average 60% or better is
enough for a D. If the mean class grade on an exam falls below 70% I will
`curve' the scores so as to bring the mean up to between 70% and 75%.

If you miss the final, you must contact me within 24 hours of the exam date,
explaining why you missed the exam, and providing a doctor's note and a phone
number where you may be reached. If your excuse is satisfactory, you will be
given a grade of I (incomplete), and the make-up final exam will be scheduled
during the first or second week of the spring semester. It will be of an essay
(not short-answer) type.

**THE LABORATORY COMPONENT OF THIS COURSE:**

When you registered for this course you automatically signed up for one of the
associated lab sections, to be held in Room 516 Kell. Before attending the
first lab you must have purchased the lab manual. If you have taken Astr 1010
recently, you do not need to purchase a manual, as the one you have contains
both sets of labs, though a supplementary packet of new material may need to
be purchased. Mr. John Wilson (Rm. 710 One Park Place, Ph: 404-651-1271), is
in overall-charge of the labs. Either Mr. Wilson or one of the Graduate
Teaching Assistants will be your lab instructor. If you have any questions
about the labs, be sure to ask your instructor first, then Mr. Wilson (if he
isn't your instructor); contact me in this regard only after speaking with
him. Computer number 1073 corresponds to a lab on Mondays from 9:00 AM--10:50
AM; 1075 to a lab on Tuesdays from 11:00 AM--12:50 PM; 1077 to Fridays from
9:00 AM--10:50 AM.

If you miss a lab during the first half of the course you will have an
opportunity to make it up at the middle of the semester; if you miss one in
the second half of the term, you can make it up at the very last lab meeting.
Any missed lab that is not made up (which includes any in excess of one per
half-semester) counts as a zero, and will have a substantial negative impact
on your lab grade, which in turn, is worth 25% of your course grade. You are
also required to attend an observing session, the schedule of which will be
announced in the labs. The smart student does this early in the quarter.
Finally, note that while you are expected to complete every lab you must
attend at least 7 labs and an observing session in order to get credit for
this laboratory science course (i.e., if you miss half or more of the labs,
you can't pass the course, even if you have a 100% average on the exams,
assignments and quizzes).

I trust you enjoyed Astr 1010 and hope that you will find Astr 1020 even more
interesting. Feel free to give me suggestions at any time (in person after
class, or via phone or e-mail) on how we might work together to make this
class better.

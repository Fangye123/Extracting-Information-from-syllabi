Course Description

**

This graduate level course will explore the field of Asian American History.
The category Asian American refers to people in the United States of Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, Filipino, South Asian, and Southeast Asian ancestry. The
readings selected represent both "classic" texts as well as new scholarship in
the field. The authors frequently incorporate interdisciplinary approaches to
enrich their understanding of history or use history to further their analysis
of contemporary issues. Through readings and discussion, we will examine
central concepts in Asian American History and ask how the experiences of
Asian Americans complicate existing understandings of American race relations,
gender roles, sexual norms, and national identity.

Course Requirements

**

1. Discussion facilitation and participation (30%). This is a discussion-based course. Its success relies on your ability to complete the readings before class and to enthusiastically engage in discussion. Each student will be responsible for leading discussion for at least one class session. Depending on the size of the class, you may be responsible for facilitating more discussions. You may want to provide a short (5 minute) presentation about the issues that you found most relevant in the readings and/or prepare a series of questions to facilitate discussion.

2. Four reading responses (2-3 pages) (30%). These responses are graded +/check/-. This is your opportunity to reflect on the main themes from the reading assignments, to articulate your reactions, and raise questions for discussion. These responses are intended to help you conceptualize the readings in a succinct and coherent manner. I recommend writing 1-2 paragraphs summarizing the main argument or arguments from the readings and an additional 2-3 paragraphs offering your critiques. These responses are due by _12:30 in my office, 152 Dulles_ , on the day that the readings will be discussed.

3. Final Project (40%). Select one of the following three options:

a. Historiography Paper. Write a 12-15 page paper analyzing the changes in
historical scholarship on a topic of your choice. You may want to focus on a
particular theme, such as immigration, family, or labor, or you could focus on
a particular Asian American ethnic group, such as Filipino Americans or
Cambodian Americans.

b. If you are working on a research project related to the topic of Asian
American History, you could complete a portion of your thesis/research paper
for course credit. The section that you submit must demonstrate how historical
approaches to understanding Asian American experiences relate to your subject.
If you desire, you may share your research with the class and gain feedback to
help you revise. You must sign up for a specific date and turn-in your work by
12:30, the week before the scheduled discussion.

c. Develop a syllabus on a topic related to Asian American History and write a
lecture for the course. Think about the students that you want to attract and
how to frame your topic. You could develop a survey course in Asian American
History or an interdisciplinary course in Asian American Studies. You could
also develop a more specialized thematic course, such as immigration in U.S.
History, Asian American politics, or Third World Feminism. The syllabus and
lecture must demonstrate how Asian American History contributes to the central
themes for the course.

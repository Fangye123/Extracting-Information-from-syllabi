**Course coverage** is approximately chronological. Lectures will concentrate
on the key episodes and years of United States foreign policy, war and peace
making in the 20th century through the Vietnam period which by now can be
viewed in perspectives of historical time. Concentration of coverage will
focus on: the world power status assumed after the Spanish-American-Philippine
War, Wilson and the Mexican Revolution, Wilson and the Entry into World War I,
the Treaty of Versailles, Isolation, FDR and the coming of World War II, World
War II itself and the Summit Conferences, the early cold war, Korean War, and
Vietnam War. There will be time at the end to consider and discuss some of the
turbulent and striking events of recent years, Irangate, Desert Storm, and
last but not least the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the uncertain
role of the US as  "the last superpower." Many lectures will include a certain
portion of audio-visual material.

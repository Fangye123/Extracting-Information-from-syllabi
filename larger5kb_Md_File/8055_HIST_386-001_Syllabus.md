> **Course Title:** The History of World War I

>

> **Course Description:** The Great War of 1914 to 1918, also known as World
War I, in its scope, its violence and, above all, in its totality, ushered in
a century of global war. Never before had a war absorbed so many combatants.
Never before had so many nations been involved in the fighting. Never before
had the slaughter been so comprehensive and indiscriminate. Never before had
the participants staked so much for so little. World War I changed the face of
modern Europe and the World. The war paved the way for the Russian Revolution,
World War II and the global turmoil that would consume the world for the rest
of the century. It is the purpose of this course to examine the History of
World War I to determine the significance and meaning of the conflict for this
generation of Americans.

The final exam is May 9, 2000.

critical review of two books related to the History of World War I. Your paper
may be handed in at any time during the semester. The final due date for your
paper is April 18, 2000. Students taking this option are required to take the
final exam but are not required to take the midterm exam.

contrast and compare your books. The average length of your paper should be
six to eight pages. Papers should be carefully read and corrected for mistakes
in spelling and style.

critically evaluate fictional/scholarly works concerning the history of World

your books. I do not want a simple summary of the contents of each book. The
main emphasis should be on a discussion of the author's thesis and your
evaluation of it.

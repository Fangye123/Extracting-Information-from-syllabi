**Stone Tool Analysis**

**Syllabus**

**This class is a detailed introduction to the method and practice of analysis
of archaeological stone tool technology. Students will be taught the rudiments
of flintknapping, principles of scientific methodology including how to set up
computer-driven analytical frameworks, and required to perform basic
technological and functional analysis of stone tools.**

**An innovative aspect of the course is liberal use of the Internet for
transmission of resource materials, information, and completion of assigned
exercises, quizzes and examinations. We will have required chatrooms once a
week, often with guest experts. Use of online resources combined with hands-on
practicums greatly accelerates student introductions to the subject of stone
tool technology.**

**Please remember that this course has a strong Internet component. Students,
instructors, guest experts and resource people will be transmitting
conversations, written materials, and images online. Student exercises,
quizzes and examinations, and performance evaluations will be accessible by
the instructor and the graduate assistant. Your conversations will be
accessible online as a permanent record. Your submitted assignments will be
kept for a period extending two weeks beyond the end of the course as a secure
digital archive. These materials will be expunged on a regular basis unless
formal permission is sought from you for long term archiving. Students should
keep copy files of all transmitted materials to ensure against errors in
transmission or record keeping.**

**Course Objective :**

**At the completion of this course, students will have a good basic knowledge
of archaeological analyses of stone tool production and use. Past students
have been able to join archaeological field and lab projects as lithic
analysts, responsible for basic design of lithic research and lab and analysis
protocols. Students are encouraged to pursue avenues of research highlighted
in this course, and to continue correspondence with researchers introduced in
our reading and in chatrooms.**

**Schedule :**

**We will decide on a schedule that is convenient for all students, which
requires attendance at one two-hour in-person meeting per week. There will
also be scheduled required online two-hour chatrooms every week. Selected
class resources will be available for purchase and online.**

**Grading :**

**Students will be graded based on: participation and attendance including
online chatrooms and information sharing (15%); completion of assigned
practical exercises (45%); completion of eight quizzes (15%) and two midterm
examinations (25%).**

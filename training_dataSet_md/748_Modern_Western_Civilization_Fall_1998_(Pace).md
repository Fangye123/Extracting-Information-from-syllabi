**_Attendance Policy_** :  
Attendance in the class is _REQUIRED_. Because much of the information in this
class comes from lectures and in-class discussions, absences will place the
student significantly behind, therefore, attendance records will be kept. If a
student arrives after roll is taken, it is the student's responsibility to
make sure his or her presence has been recorded AT THE END OF THAT DAY'S
CLASS. If a student's absences, both excused and unexcused, equal 25% of the
class days (for Section 02, that means nine classes; **for section 05, that
means _3_ classes!** ), the student will automatically fail the course (no
questions asked).

 Return to Table of Contents  


**_Make-up Policy_** :  
Make-up exams will be administered _only_ when students can show a valid
reason for their absence (this means confirmation from either the health
center or from the dean). Students must schedule the make-up exam with the
instructor within one week of the original exam. Failure to make such
arrangements will result in failure of the course.

 Return to Table of Contents  


**_Honor Code_ :**  
Students are expected to comply with the honor code on all work for the
course.  Cheating will result in an automatic "F" for the semester and the
student will be taken before the honor board.

 Return to Table of Contents  


**_On-line Quizzes and Document Reviews_**  
All chapter assignments should be read in the week that they are assigned.
After the student has read the chapter, including the documents placed
throughout the chapter, he or she will use the Internet and go to the Prentice
Hall Webpage for our textbook. Use the on-line instructions to go to the
appropriate chapter(s) assigned for that week. Students must make sure that
the instructor's email address
([rpace@longwood.lwc.edu](mailto:rpace@longwood.lwc.edu)) appears on the form
for the results to be sent to him. This can be accomplished through changing
the "Preferences" section on the page, or through typing the address after you
have submitted the quiz for scoring. Also make sure you click the buttons for
the chapter number and title to be included. Students will complete the
multiple choice quiz and the documents review sections of the page each week.
The due dates for these assignments are clearly marked above in the "Course
Schedule." No assignments will be accepted after the due dates, and students
will receive a "zero" for all assignments not completed in time.

**_Group Research Projects:_**  
Historians can only understand the vast information about the past through
making connections. Details about our history can seem overwhelming to even
the most accomplished historians without using analytical and critical
thinking skills to discern patterns and themes to help define the past. The
authors of our textbook have woven several themes throughout the work. I will
also follow these themes in lectures. Students will be divided into groups
that will spend the semester looking at these individual themes. There will be
six groups to look at three themes:

Groups 1 and 2: "The role of individual rights in relation to political
freedom, constitutional government, and concern for the rule of law."

Groups 3 and 4: "The shifting relationship between religion, society, and the
state."

Groups 5 and 6: "The growth of the impact of science and technology on
thought, social institutions, and everyday life."

After the group assignments have been made, these groups will have several
responsibilities:

A. Each week, we will have discussions in class over the textbook readings.
These discussions will especially focus on the documents in the textbook. All
students are required to read all assignments, but students will also think
about the chapter and document readings in relation to the theme of their
group. When we have the discussion in class, students will be first placed in
their groups and will have to decide, as a group, what aspects of the assigned
readings applies to their topic. Then, group representatives will explain to
the rest of the class any connections that the group has discerned. Some
weeks, we will be looking at one theme more than others, therefore, not every
group will have as much to say as others. All students will be expected to ask
questions of the other groups, or make points related to the other group's
topic, if that group seems to have missed something. At the end of the
semester, the group that the instructor deems to have made the most important
contributions to class discussions will receive five points added to their
final exam grade. The group that makes the second-most important contribution
to class discussion (in the instructor's opinion) will receive three points
added to their final exam grade.

B. The Project  
In addition to class discussions, each of the six groups will produce a 30- to
40-page project report on their topic. Each student in the group will be
responsible for at least five pages of the report. It is up to the group to
decide how the work will be divided. The report will consist of the following
components:

1\. Annotated Bibliography: Each group will produce an annotated bibliography,
which will contain at least thirty books that relate to their topic. In
addition to these thirty books, the bibliography should also contain at least
ten primary documents (those in the textbook should _not_ be included on this
list). For the primary documents, students may use the World Wide Web, but
make sure you cite the proper web address for any primary document you find on
the web. For this annotated bibliography, books should be listed in
alphabetical order according to the first author's last name. In addition, the
citation should include a three- to five-sentence annotation, discussing the
main thesis of the book, the main areas of discussion in the book, and how the
book relates to your topic. For example:  


**Ambrose, Stephen E. _Undaunted Courage: Meriwether Lewis, Thomas Jefferson,
and_**  
**_     the Opening of the American West_. New York: Touchstone Books, 1997.**

This work is Ambrose's attempt to frame Meriwether Lewis as a great scientist-
explorer, whose contributions to the exploration of the American west have
been underestimated. Ambrose provides background on Lewis' life, then uses
Lewis' diaries and other sources to describe, in detail, the great adventure
of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Ambrose also puts this expedition within
the context of the changes of the early American nation. This books best fits
the topic of _????????????_ because it deals with _????????????????_ , and
therefore explains _?????????????_ about the topic.

  
**Kornfeld, Eve. _Margaret Fuller: A Brief Biography with Documents_**.
**Boston: Bedford**  
**     Books, 1997.**

Annotation follows.

  2\. Narrative Argument: The project will also include a narrative
description of how the group's topic has influenced Western Civilization since
the seventeenth century. This narrative will propose a general thesis about
the topic, and then will discuss at least fifteen events in the history of
modern western civilization that have influenced, or have demonstrated that
thesis regarding the group's topic. These events should be discussed in
chronological order, unless the thesis is such that a more topical approach to
discussing the events would make sense.   3\. Biographical Sketches: The
project should conclude with five to ten biographical sketches of those
individuals your group decides were the _most_ influential in shaping your
theme throughout Modern Western Civilization. Choose these people carefully;
part of your sketch should be to justify that person's inclusion on the list.

**Please note that all information obtained for parts two and three should be
cited according to Kate Turabian, _A Manual for Writers. . ._. Sources should
be cited (in footnotes or endnotes) for all information. Failure to do so will
result in a significant reduction in the grade. Examples of the form required
can be found at <http://web.lwc.edu/academic/las/history/rp110syl.htm#form>

(This is part of a syllabus from last year, so don't get confused).

 ***All project reports should include a title page with all group members'
names included. The title page should also have the pledge of honor typed on
it and all members of the group should sign under the pledge.

_Grading for the Group Project:_  
As indicated above, the group project is worth 15% of the semester grade. ALL
STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE THE SAME GRADE FOR THE PROJECT. The instructor will give
the three sections of the assignment a separate grade, but because the second
part is the most comprehensive, it will be worth twice as much. The instructor
will also give a separate grade for citation form, writing, punctuation,
spelling, and grammar.

In addition, because there are a few individuals who refuse to "do their
share" in a group project, such as this, all students are required to grade
their classmates and themselves on this project. These grades will be given to
the instructor separately from the project, but are due on the same date. The
instructor will throw out the high and the low grade and average together the
rest. This student grade will be worth 1/6th of the project grade. In short,
grading will be determined as follows:

Annotated Bibliography------------------1/6  
Narrative--------------------------------1/3  
Biographical Sketches-------------------1/6  
Form, grammar, etc.---------------------1/6  
Classmate grades------------------------1/6  
    
This assignment is due in the Thirteenth Week of the semester. Section 05 must
turn it in on Tuesday, November 17, 1998; Section 02 must turn it in on
Wednesday, November 18, 1998. Ten points per day will be deducted from the
final project grade for every day the assignment is late.

**_Grade Posting:_**  
I will post exam grades on the door to my office for all students who wish to
learn their grade before I give the exams back to the class. If you would like
your grades to appear on this list, you must supply me with a four-digit
number that you can remember, and your grade will be posted next to that
number. Choose a number that has little opportunity of being duplicated (no
1111 or 0000).

Students needing accommodations for disabilities should contact the instructor
or Scott Lissner in the Learning Center.

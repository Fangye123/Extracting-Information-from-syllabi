*Also, please obtain an inexpensive calculator (one that allows you to do square roots easily). You will need to bring it to both class and discussion.   


**Course Description**

The objective of this class is to help you develop a deep understanding of
statistical concepts and their applications in psychological science. We will
focus on the role of mathematics and statistics in the development of
psychological theory with particular attention given to their role in data
collection, data analysis, and the evaluation statistical research claims.
This class will strengthen your critical thinking skills in the application,
analysis and interpretation of statistical tools and concepts.

Although you may not realize it yet, you already have a intuitive sense of
what statistics are and how we use them to evaluate our environment and make
predictions. For example, you are probably able provide some _estimate_ the
likelihood of seeing a "shooting star" at any one moment that you look into
the night sky (from very likely to very unlikely). This estimate or prediction
will most likely be based upon _your past experience_ and can be expressed as
a ratio of the number of the number of shooting stars you may have seen in
your lifetime over the total number of times you have looked up into the night
sky, perhaps on the order of 1/1000000. In most cases, you would have probably
replied that it was "not very likely", especially if you live in the city
where light pollution obscures the night sky most of the time. It is this type
intuitive statistical human reasoning that provides some of the motivation for
the more formalized types of quantification and analysis you will learn about
in this class.  


**Course Requirements**

_Attendance_. It is expected that you will attend every class. The lecture
will build upon and elaborate on the concepts presented in the readings. One
of the most common problems students encounter in statistics is 'falling
behind' and this will undoubtedly occur if you miss class.

_Reading_. It's a must. Your book was selected for its _readability_ and how
clearly its presents each concept. In addition, it focuses on providing
conceptual understanding rather than just simply presenting the mathematics.
It is expected that you will keep up with the readings (again, you don't want
to fall behind). It is to your benefit to read the relevant chapter **before**
you come to class. This allows you to get an idea of what was difficult for
you to understand in the chapter and ask questions. In addition, it prepares
you for the lecture since I will not be simply re-hashing the textbook but
instead elaborating and providing additional ways to think about material
covered in the text.

_Homework_. There will be a homework assignment every week. Homework is
fundamental to the learning process. You will not learn the relevant material
unless you _practice_ it. All homework will be test oriented. That is, what
you will be asked to do for your homework will be similar to what you will be
asked to do on a test. So again, it is in your best interest to keep up with
the homework and take it seriously - like a practice test. Homework will be
assigned at the beginning of each week and will be turned in at the
**beginning** of class on Friday. We will then go over the assignment in class
so it is best to bring two copies (the original and a photocopy), one to turn
in to me and and one to take notes on so you will know what errors you made.
Any homework turned in after the beginning of class will be considered LATE
and will you lose 2 points for each week day after (weekends do not count).
Homework will be returned the following Friday.

_Tests_. There will be a total of three tests given during the semester as
well as a final. Of the three tests, you only need to take two of them because
only two of the three will count towards your grade. This is done so there
will be **no need for make-up tests**. If you have an emergency and miss ONE
of the three tests, that test will be dropped and the other two tests will be
used to calculate your grade. Otherwise you may take all three tests and have
the lowest score dropped or, if you choose, you can skip ONE of the three
tests and count the other two towards your grade. HOWEVER, the final is
_mandatory_ and _cumulative_ covering material from the **entire** semester.
So you will have a total of three tests count towards your grade, two of the
semester tests and the final.

Tests will consist of multiple choice, fill in the blank, essay, and
computational questions. 50% of the test material will be from the book and
50% will be from lecture. Computations will be held to a minimum, but
calculators are allowed.  


**Grade Calculation**

Its easy, your grade consists of points from homework and tests.

Homework = 130 points (13 at 10 points)  
Tests = 200 points (2 at 100 pts each)  
Final = 100 points (1 at 100 pts)

430-387 = A    386-344 = B    343-301 = C    300-258 = D    257-Below = F  
This is based on a 100, 90, 80, etc. scale. You should keep track of your own
grades.  


**Cheating Policy**

I never expect to encounter any cheating, but in fairness to those who take
their education seriously, cheating in any facet of this course will not be
tolerated. Cheating includes giving or receiving information during a test, or
copying another student's homework, or handing something in this class that
was used in another class. Anyone caught cheating will receive a failing grade
on the assignment or test and potentially the class. For more information see
the university's academic dishonesty guidelines \-->

**College Drop Policy**

Students may drop courses without penalty during the first ten days of the
semester (through Friday of week 2) using UIC Express. Between week 3 and
Friday of week 9, undergraduates are entitled to a total of two optional date
drops for the duration of their enrollment in LAS. Optional date drops require
an appointment with an LAS advisor (996 - 3366). LAS advisors (third floor UH)
are also available on walk-in days (8:30 - 3:30 on Tuesdays and on Friday of
week 9).  


**Disability Services**

Students with disabilities who require accommodations for access and
participation in this course must be registered with the Office of Disability
Services (ODS). Please contact ODS at 312/413-2103 or 312/413-0123.

**Class Updates**

_Update 1/14/02:_   Check out the Schedule; week 4 and week 5 have been
switched around. We will now cover chapter three before exam 1\. This was done
in an effort to cover similar amounts of material on each exam. Thus exam 1
will cover material from Chapters 1-3.

_Update 1/20/02_ : The discussion section room has been officially moved from
BSB 237 to BSB 2057 (right down the hall from where we meet in 2019). We will
meet in 2057 on Fridays the remainder of the semester.

_Update 2/10/02_ : Grades link is now _officially_ active, has scores for
first three homeworks and EXAM 1. This link will be updated the weekend after
each exam. Check out the histogram, and descriptive statistics to see where
your scores fits into the distribution. Also soon to be active is the EXAM 1
answers, click on this link and view the answers for EXAM 1\. If you have any
questions on exam scores or answers please email me and set up an appointment
to stop by.

_Update 2/19/02_ : The answers for [homework 4](homework_4.pdf) will be posted
soon so check your answers against mine. If you still have questions please
email me and set up an appointment to stop by. **Class on Friday March 1st
will be moved from our usual room (2056) to 1076 BSB (right across from my
office).

_Update 2/27/02_ : Things are changing before your eyes. Check out the
schedule, EXAM 2 has been postponed until Monday March 11th. This will allow
us to spend an entire week on Chapter 7; examining confidence intervals and
t-tests with sample means. Also, notice the very next two classes will be
lectures on Effect Size and Statistical Power and the homework for chapter 8
is due the Monday _after_ Spring Break.

_Update 3/9/02_ : The [topic sheet](study_guide_EXAM2.pdf) for exam 2 and the
answers for [homework 7](homework_7.pdf) are now online.

_Update 3/15/02_ : Homework # 9 which is due **Monday** March 25th (the Monday
after spring break) is Chapter 8 problems 1, 3, and 6. Your scores and the
class statistics for EXAM 2 will be posted on Monday March 18th after 6pm. I
will also update the grades link with your current homework scores at this
time. Please check your scores and calculate your current grade in the course.
Have a good Spring Break.

_Update 3/19/02_ : Exam 2 answers are now online, click on this link and view
the answers for EXAM 2. If you have any questions on exam scores or answers
please email me and set up an appointment to stop by.

_Update 3/19/02_ : *** The table in number 3 set II for homework # 9 (Chapter
8) has a misprint. The upper case sigma in the second column under population
should be replaced with the lower case sigma (i.e., standard deviation). These
.5 values are the standard deviation. If confused look at  the table in
problem 3 set I.

_Update 4/02/02_ : Extra Credit 2. Another popular media / news statistic can
be turned in for 2 points extra credit. For this assignment you have to turn
in the statistic (e.g., article, advertisement, etc.) and a one paragraph
summary of what information is being communicated. Due Date: April 19th, 2002.

_Update 4/02/02_ : Extra Credit 3. Correlation Exercise worth 5 points.
Collect data on two variables that interest YOU. You need 15 observations for
both variables. Turn in a brief one page write up. Explain what you did? That
is, how did you collect the data? Why are the variables you picked
interesting? What is your hypothesis as to how these variables are related?
How did you come up with your hypothesis (e.g., prior research, informal
observation, intuition)? Use the [correlation
calculator](http://p034.psch.uic.edu/correlations.htm) (created by Dr. Chris
Fraley) to calculate the pearson R. What results did you get (e.g., degree and
direction)? How would you interpret these results?  
    What to turn in: (1) page that the correlation calculator gives you with the result and input given. (2) One page summary answering each of the above questions. Due Date: April 19th, 2002. 

_Update 4/02/02_ : Exam 3 prediction model. I will create a prediction model
for you to estimate your performance on the next exam. This model will be
based on two or three predictor variables including performance on previous
exams, performance on homeworks, and attendance. *Reminder* prediction models
are only as good as the correlations they are based on (i.e., strong
correlations indicate a more accurate prediction because the model can explain
more of the variance). Also of crucial importance is the role of _prior
assumptions_ in a statistical model. In this case, I assume people will treat
the third exam like exam 1 and 2 (e.g., study style, amount of study, etc.)
and that past performance and its relationship to exam scores are indicative
of future performance. Another important topic to think about is the role of
individual differences in prediction models. Do we capture the differences of
individual performance with our model?

_Update 4/12/02_ : The answers for [homework 10](homework_10.pdf) are now
online so check your answers against mine. If you still have questions please
email me and set up an appointment to stop by.  


_Update 4/22/02_ : Here is the prediction model for EXAM 3; Zscore _exam3_ =
(B1) (Zscore   _previous exams_ ) + (B2) (Zscore _homeworks_ ). Walk through
the following four steps to calculate your Zscore for exam 3\.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  
_Step 1_  
Calculate your Z score for both exams 1 & 2\. I know, I know, you say "HOW do
I calculate my Z scores for these exams?" Well, remember back to the
transformation equation we learned about early on in the semester? It is
relevant once again [Z = (X - M) / SD] . Take the general descriptive
statistics that I reported on each exam, i.e., the mean and standard deviation
(see [grade links](grades.html)) and use your RAW score on that exam to
calculate each Zscore. After you have calculated a Z for each exam take the
average of the two Z scores, add them up and divide by two (there are
alternatives to using this approach but since we are using standardized
measures this is one appropriate method).

_Step 2_  
Next, you will need to find your Z score for homeworks. To do this take your
average performance on homeworks up to this point (i.e., through homework 11).
Descriptive statistics for class performance on homework is the following: a
_MEAN_ of 8.14 and a _Standard Deviation_ of 1.30. Now you can calculate your
Z score performance on average homework performance through homework 11.

The final model looks like this:

Zscore _exam3_ = (.40*) (Zscore   _previous exams_ ) + (.62*) (Zscore
_homeworks_ )

_*Betas were based on correlations between previous class performance and EXAM
2._

_Step 3_  
Substitute your Z scores into the equation and calculate the predicted Zscore
for exam 3.

_Step 4_  
How do you interpret the Z score for exam 3? Well, it depends on the
performance of the class. You can use the EXAM 2 descriptive statistics as a
guide and the then transform this Z score back into a raw score based on the
performance on EXAM 2 descriptive statistics [X = (Z exam3) (SD exam2) +
M(exam2)]. This is assuming the performance on EXAM 3 will be like performance
on EXAM 2.

_Update 4/26/02_ : Exam 3 answers are now online, click on this link and view
the answers for EXAM 3. If you have any questions on exam scores or answers
please email me and set up an appointment to stop by. An updated grade sheet
will be posted by Monday the 29th which include scores on all exams (except
the final) and homeworks.

Update _4/29/02_ : The grades page is now fully updated with homework scores
from HW1-HW13 and all three exam scores. *Remember when figuring your grade I
drop the lowest of the first three exams. The only scores not reported is the
final and any extra credit points earned. If you are curious as to the amount
of extra credit earned make an appointment to stop by after the FINAL. Good
luck studying for the final!! Also remember that the person with the best
score on the final exam receives there very own copy of "The Lady Tasting Tea:
How Statistics Revolutionized Science" by David Salsburg (WOW!! how grand, now
that's statistically significant!!).

_Update 5/05/02_ : The final has been graded and posted. The [final
answers](FINAL_answers.pdf) are online as well, click on this link and view
the answers for the FINAL. The grades page is now fully updated with HW1-
HW13, the three semester EXAMS, the FINAL, and extra credit points. The FINAL
grades for the course have been calculated and are posted in the last column
in the Grades table. If you would like to come by sometime this week and pick
up your final exam please do I am in most days but if you want to be sure I'll
be around send an email first.

_Update 5/05/02_ : . . . .  And now for the winner  . . . or  . . . . should I
say WINNERS of the "Lady Tasting Tea", in no particular order are Amishi and
Hardik who both scored a 98 on the FINAL. Congratulations. Please stop by
sometime later this week (after Tuesday) to receive your prize.

HAVE A NICE SUMMER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

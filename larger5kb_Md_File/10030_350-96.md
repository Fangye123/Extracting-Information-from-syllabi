#### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

The course begins with the Franks who, under the leadership of Clovis, managed
to blend their barbarian culture with that of Late Roman Christianity to
produce the nation we have come to know as France. Next we move to the
Merovingians (the "Long-Haired Kings") and the world of Charlemagne, examining
the process of reform that marked the Carolingian Renaissance and the decline
that followed the Viking invasions. The Capetian dynasty (987-1328) becomes
the focus of the central portion of the course. We look at expanding horizons,
the creation of Normandy, an urban explosion, the rise of universities, and
cultural and social changes in the High Middle Ages, culminating in the
holiness of Louis IX and the arrogance of his grandson Philip the Fair. With
the coming to power of the Valois dynasty (1328-1498), we trace a pattern of
decline and disaster on all fronts. Finally, we examine the "militant miracle"
of Joan of Arc and the process of recovery that set France on the road to
royal absolutism.

#### COURSE REQUIREMENTS

:

  * 1\. Members of the class should familiarize themselves with the resources available to them in the computer lab. I will communicate with the class via a distribution list and will expect everyone to check e-mail frequently. Additional readings may be found on World Wide Web sites, such as ORB (http://orb.rhodes.edu) or other library collections. My folder on the Academic Volume contains copies of this syllabus, writing guidelines, and other helpful tips. Take time to discover what is available and use it to your own advantage. 
  * 2\. Each student in the class will be responsible for leading one class session based on an assigned text that supplements the reading done by the entire class. In addition, you will be expected to provide a brief summary of the book under discussion, which will then be posted to the class distribution list. Topics and books are listed below in the day-by-day class schedule. Performance as discussion leader will count for 20% of the course grade. 
  * 3\. There will be a midterm and final exam. Each will be in essay format and will count as 20% of the course grade. 
  * 4\. For students enrolled in History 350 for regular credit, the writing requirement will be a research paper, approximately 10 pages long, on some aspect of the development of medieval France. You will find a list of suggested subjects attached to this syllabus. The paper should include analysis of primary source material, if possible, as well as an extensive bibliography of secondary works. The purpose of your research is not merely to collect information; you must devote much of your effort to interpreting it. For example, you should not simply write a paper on medieval women, describing their status and experiences. Your paper should discuss, instead, why their status changed, for better or worse, over the entire period under investigation. The research project is to be an ongoing one, with three progress reports. Your research efforts and the finished project will make up 25% of the course grade. 
  * 5\. For students taking this course as History 450, which carries Senior Seminar credit, the writing requirement will be a 10-12-page review of literature on your chosen topic. Choice of a research area must be discussed with the instructor before September 27. Your due dates for Spring Semester include: 
    * Working draft of senior project due February 28 
    * Peer reviews, March 17-21 
    * Final 20-25-page paper due April 4 
  * 6\. The final grade for the course will be determined on the following basis: 
    * Midterm exam....................................................20% 
    * Discussion leader...............................................20% 
    * Research paper...................................................25% 
    * Class attendance..................................................5% 
    * Class participation.............................................10% 
    * Final Exam.........................................................20%

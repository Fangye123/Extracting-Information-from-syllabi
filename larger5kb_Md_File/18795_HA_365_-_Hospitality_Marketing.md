###  Course Description:

  1. The study of marketing, and its role in the hospitality industry. 

Major topics include:

    1. **Marketing Planning**
    2. **Marketing Information and Research (internal and environmental factors that affect marketing strategies)**
    3. **Consumer Behavior**
    4. **Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning**
    5. **Product Strategies**
    6. **Pricing Strategies**
    7. **Place (location) Strategies**
    8. **Promotional Strategies**

The basic purpose of this class is to give you insights into the various means
of improving a hospitality firm's image, its sales, and profit.

  2. Through your marketing plan project you will also be given the opportunity to practice developing marketing strategies and tactics. 
  3. What the course is not. There are simply too many important topics that need to be reviewed for this course to focus on training you toward competency in any one area. This course will help educate you in the fundamentals of Marketing. Training is what takes place on the job, through the repetition of the various Marketing tasks.

###  Course Objectives:

By the end of the course the student should have a working knowledge of
marketing in the hospitality industry, consisting of:

  1. Basic marketing theory.
  2. Analysis of potential consumer markets.
  3. Creating strategies, primarily; decisions on products (goods and services), pricing, place/location/distribution, and promotional strategies. 
  4. Preparing a marketing plan for any hospitality business.
  5. My Personal Objective for Students (Your Personal Development): 

To have our students recognized by their employers as effective problem
solvers with obvious advancement potential; and in this effort, to positively
differentiate our students from those of other hospitality programs. Being
recognized as a problem-solver (a doer, rather than an observer), will provide
you with many exciting career and personal opportunities. This skill is also
the primary differentiating point between those with average salaries and
those making in the $100,000 range or more.

Your semester project can be taken with you for your job interviews.

### Explanation of Assignments and Grading:

**Each assignment must be emailed to me
at[Allen.Reich@nau.edu](mailto:allen.reich@nau.edu)**

The value for the Review Questions and Strategy Reviews is 50% of your grade.

Your semester project counts as 50% of your grade.

  1. **Answer the Review Questions at the back of assigned chapters**

Use complete sentences. Grading will be based on the quality of the response.
It is not necessary to go into great detail. Normally one or two sentences
will be sufficient.

  2. **Strategy Reviews**  
Strategy revews that do not follow the guidelines provided below will not be
graded.

These are eight (8) typed summaries of an article related to:

    1. marketing research, 
    2. consumer behavior, 
    3. competitive behavior (This is information on a firm that competes for the same type of customer you will do your project on. If your project was going to be on a full-service restaurant, Chili's for example, you would prepare this strategy review on another full-service restaurant--TGI Friday's. For this strategy review, you should find an article that discusses marketing strategies for this competitor.), 
    4. products and services, 
    5. pricing, 
    6. place/location, 
    7. personal communication channels (sales/salespeople) and 
    8. non-personal channels (mass media). 

The minimum length is about two-thirds of a page of text (about 200 words),
the maximum is about one and a half pages of text. At least 3 of your sources
should be academic, peer reviewed journals (e.g., Cornell Quarterly, Journal
of Hospitality and Tourism Research, Journal of Hospitality and Tourism
Education, etc.). The remainder can be from the Internet, from trade magazines
(Restaurant Business, Hotel Management), and from newspapers. A maximum of 3
can be from newspapers (e.g., USA Today).

Contents and Format for Strategy Review:

    1. **Heading**

HA 345 Strategy Review  
To: Mary Wilson  
Title: Director of Marketing  
From: Your name  
Date: Due date  
Subject: Consumer Behavior

    2. **Review/summary - a separate paragraph**

A single paragraph for both the summary and opinion will receive a 30 point
deduction. This is a brief review of what is discussed (what the company is
doing, what the author researched, etc.). A single paragraph is generally
okay. Someone reading it must feel that the main point of the article has been
clearly communicated.

    3. **Opinion - a separate paragraph**

Your opinion of what was written--why you feel the firm is doing it (the
author is recommending it), potential alternative strategies, could it be
adopted by certain other hospitality firms, and general thoughts on the
article. Basically, what do you think can be learned, both positively and
negatively, from the firm's actions or the author 's ideas.

    4. **Reference**

Your source must be properly referenced. You do not need to use a separate
sheet of paper for the reference.

Association (APA) and is the most common format for business writing.):

that the main concepts of the article have been expressed); clarity (what you
have written is understandable); logic (Your opinion is moderately rational
and is supported); and grammar.

will be no tests.**

  3. **Marketing Plan - Individual Project**

[The Marketing Plan](MPlan.pdf)

  4.     1. You will prepare a brief marketing plan for the hospitality firm of your choice. If you are not an HRM major, you can do the plan on the business of your choice. Selecting a firm that you think you would like to work for can help determine if it is the right company and also prepare you for interviews. 
    2. Specific guidelines are on this site. 

The following is Very, Very, Important:

      1. Please make sure you follow the Marketing Plan outline/guidelinesprovided. A table of contents for your plan is provided in the guidelines. 
      2. After each detailed explanation of the sections of the plan (Internal Analysis, Environmental Analysis, etc.), there is a listing of the explicit requirements for that section (e.g., Objectives Requirement). This particular section also includes examples of what you will turn in. 
      3. If you read and carefully follow the material in the course project files, you should not have major problems completing it. Most students will however have questions on various topics. If you have any questions, I will be happy to help you.

customize your project to meet your needs.

###  Disabilities/Special Needs:

If any student has a special need, please see me as soon as possible so that

###  Honor Code:

form of academic dishonesty. The Honor Code will be strictly enforced in this
class (primarily, copying other students' or authors' work, allowing other
students to copy your work, signing someone else's name on a roll sheet, and
lying). All assignments submitted shall be considered as course work covered
by the Honor System. Honesty in your academic work will develop into
professional integrity and personal character. All students have a
responsibility to become intimately familiar with the Honor System and its
code. Ignorance of the Honor Code is not considered sufficient justification
for violating any aspect of the code.

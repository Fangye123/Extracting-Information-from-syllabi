# Philosophy of Science X303

## Syllabus, Spring, 1996

  

  

Dr. Rumsey, Knobview 200L  
Dr. Forinash, Physical Science 101  

This course begins with a careful look at a key period in the history of
science -- the Copernican revolution. We will spend almost half of the term
studying the activities of some of the key figures during that period:
Copernicus, Brahe, Kepler, Galileo, Newton and others. The rest of the term
will involve an examination of the views of a number of contemporary
philosophers of science, using what we have learned about the goings on during
the Copernican revolution to evaluate their claims about what doing science
involves.  

  

**Texts:**

  * Klemke, Hollinger, and Kline (eds.) _Introductory Readings in the Philosophy of Science_ , Revised Edition 
  * Kuhn, Thomas S. _The Copernican Revolution_ 
  

  

**Written and Oral Requirements:**

  * Everyone must write a short paper (4 - 6 pages, typed, double-spaced). The topic for this paper will be assigned shortly after the semester begins. This paper may be rewritten. If you do this, and receive a better grade the second time around, then that is the grade that will count for the paper. Before rewriting, however, you must see us and discuss the project. In addition to the short paper, you must do one of the following: 
    * Write two other papers of the same length (topics to be assigned later on in the semester), or 
    * Write a 12 - 17 page term paper.  Those who are taking this course to satisfy the research writing requirement must write the term paper. For others it is optional. If you elect to do this, you must make an appointment to discuss a topic with us shortly after the first short paper is returned to you. At that time we will also negotiate a date for you to hand in a first draft. The final draft of the paper will be due on the last day of class.

  * We consider the following questions in grading papers: 
    * Did the paper show a thorough understanding of the following: 
      * The portions of Kuhn and other readings in the history of science cited; 
      * The theses of the article in Klemke which was used. 
    * Was the assessment well done? 
      * Was the assessment interesting (non-trivial) and well thought out? 
      * Were theses in the article clearly supported or refuted by appropriate citation of Kuhn and others? 
      * Could a stronger case have been made by citing more? 
    * Were any organizational and mechanical (grammar, spelling, etc.) hindrances to the clarity of the paper mino, or were they so bad as to get in the way of communication? 

  * We would prefer that you turn in your paper in electronic form, either by email or on a diskette if at all possible, although there will be no penalty for submission in hard copy. 

  * You will be required to read and comment on the papers written by other students in the class. Your comments about the other students' papers will be taken into consideration in your final grade. To facilitate your reviewing the papers of the other students we will post each student paper will be anonoymously on the internet by code. A response page for commenting on the paper will be provided, also via the internet. The author of the paper will recieve the comments and may take these comments and the instructors comments into consideration when re-writing the paper. 

  * There will be a written final examination on Wednesday, April 24th, from 4:15 to 6:05 PM in our regular classroom. This examination will consist of essay questions which will have been handed out several days earlier. You will be expected to work out answers to the questions and then to write them in class without the help of books or notes. 

  * After the first week, we will ask students to take turns in heading up discussion of reading materials assigned. You should expect to do this perhaps two or three times during the semester. Nothing as formal as a paper is required: rather, be prepared to give an oral summary (10 or 15 minutes) of some of the major points in the reading, and have a few interesting questions to raise to get us started in discussion. 
  

  

**Readings:** The readings for the course are listed below. Excepting those in
Kuhn or Klemke, all are on closed reserve in the IUS library. The readings in
List 1 will be discussed in the order they are listed. Some of the readings in
List 2 may be interspersed with those in List 1 as we progress through it, but
for the most part they will be discussed after List 1 is completed and in the
order listed. You will be expected to have read assigned materials before we
discuss them in class (whether you are reporting on them or not). Some of the
readings will be hard going. We suggest that you read through an assignment
quickly, then go back and study slowly. Read actively: ask yourself questions
and jot down problems for class discussion. After the material has been
discussed in class, go over it again, this time using class discussion and
notes as aids. Whenever possible, do this the same day as the class discussion
so that your memory of the discussion will be fresh.  

  

##  List 1

  

**Ancient Astronomy and Physics:** Kuhn, Chapters I - III, pp. 1-99 For more
on ancient Greek astronomy, read the following in Young (ed.), _Exploring the
Universe:_ , Santillana, pp. 98-109 (Pythagoreans), Rogers, pp. 110-121
(Spheres of Eudoxus and Aristotle), Rogers, pp. 121-129 (Hipparchus and
Ptolemy)

**Transition from Aristotle to Copernicus:** Kuhn, Chapter IV, pp. 100-133

**Copernicus:** Kuhn, Chapter V, pp. 134-184. For a little more detail on the
Copernican system, read Rosen, _Three Copernican Treatises_ , Introduction,
pp. 34-53.

**Tycho, Kepler, and Galileo:** Kuhn, Chapter VI, pp. 185-228. On Tycho's
observations helping Kepler, and on the accuracy of his instruments and
observations, read Hall, "Kepler and Brahe," in Young, pp. 221-225, and
Christianson, "The Celestial Palace of Tycho Brahe," in Young, pp. 226-231. On
Kepler's struggle with the data, read Koestler, "Kepler -- Eight Minutes of
Arc," in Young, pp. 232-251. On Galileo's discoveries of 1609, read Cohen,
"Galileo's Discoveries of 1609," in Young, pp. 174-178, and Galileo, "The
Starry Messenger," in Young, pp. 174-178. On Galileo's troubles with the
church, read (in Young, pp. 190-201) Koestler, _et al._ , "The Battle with
Authority", "The Sentence of the Inquisition", and "The Formula of
Abjuration". For Galileo's stress on the importance of mathematics in science,
read Galileo Galilei, selection from _Il Saggitore_ entitled "Two Kinds of
Properties," pp. 27-32 in _The Philosophy of Science_ , Danto and Morgenbesser

**The Newtonian Universe:** Kuhn, Chapter VII, pp. 229-265. Kuhn does stress
the importance of "corpuscularism" in the evolution of the Newtonian
synthesis, but he does not discuss an important source of Newtonian views on
the structure of matter -- Robert Boyle's work. On Boyle's experiments with
pressure and volume of a gas, and his definition of an element, read Magie,
_Source Book in Physics_ , pp. 84-87 and Leicaster and Kilckstein (eds.),

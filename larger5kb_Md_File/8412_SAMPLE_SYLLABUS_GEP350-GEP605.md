**_Course Description:_**  
  
"Special Projects in GIS" has been developed to meet the needs of students
using Geographic Information Systems to conduct research in any of the natural
and social science disciplines, and who wish to apply more advanced GIS
techniques to their analyses. This course will enable the intermediate GIS
users to expand their knowledge of current methodologies, and to prepare them
to conduct more complex and meaningful analyses involving modeling and
simulation.  
  
This term, the course will explore in depth the topic of "GIS for Ecology and
Environmental Studies," and will give students the opportunity to design and
develop a major GIS project. Through a series of lectures, GIS laboratory
work, and the design of a GIS project, students will learn more advanced GIS
spatial techniques and their applications to environmental management, urban
planning, economic development, risk and hazard assessment, and other arenas
of public policy and decision-making.

**_NOTE:_** Students in GEP 350/GEP 605 have varying levels of GIS skills and
background knowledge. To ensure as far a possible that everyone is "on the
same page," and to minimize the effort required to understand the topics of
spatial analysis, simulation, and modeling to be covered in this course,
students are urged to review the following material, especially as necessary
to supplement any known or potential area of deficiency.  
All students will be expected to have a grasp of the rudiments of map
composition and chart design, a familiarity with general GIS theory, a
reasonable understanding of basic statistics, and a working knowledge of
ArcView GIS software and Windows.  
For general information on thematic mapping, map composition, and chart
design, review Cartography: Thematic Map Design, by Borden Dent, 1999, McGraw
Hill, New York, NY. See especially Chapters 13, 14, 15 and 18, regarding map
composition, use of color, typeface selection, and graphing, and Chapters 4,
5, and 7, regarding thematic mapping. Chapter 6 is an excellent overview of
GIS. This book is available on reserve at the Lehman Library.  
For an accessible and clear review of geostatistics, peruse An Introduction to
Applied Geostatistics, by Edward Isaaks and R. M. Srivastava, 1989, Oxford
University Press, Oxford, UK Concentrate on Chapters 1 through 4 on
descriptive statistics. On reserve at Lehman Library.  
For an introduction to GIS theory and concepts, consult Geographical
Information Systems and Computer Cartography, by Christopher Jones, 1997,
Addison Wesley Longman, Ltd, Essex, UK; OR An Introduction to Geographical
Information Systems, by Ian Heywod, Sarah Cornelius, and Steve Carver, 1998,
Prentice Hall/Addison Wesley Longman, Ltd.

**_STUDENT PROJECT PROPOSAL PRESENTATION:_**

Each student will individually prepare and make an oral presentation to the
class of his/her project proposal research and resulting paper. The
presentations will be made in Classes 13 and 14, and are to be 15-20 minutes
in length. The presentations should cover the following topics: the title of
the project; the purpose of the project (hypothesis, problem to be solved,
etc.); brief background of the issues; the data sets required; the methodology
to be used; the flow chart of operations; the data sets that have been
acquired or located; any preliminary mapping carried out; and what further
research may stem from this project.  
  
_**PROJECT PROPOSAL PAPER:**_

Each student will individually develop a term paper detailing a GISc project
proposal for independent research. This is to be a realistic project, one
feasible of being carried out by you for an independent study course, such as
GEH 490/GEP 690, Workshop in GISc Research. In Class 5, you will submit a
brief (one or two paragraphs) synopsis of your project concept, which I will
comment on and return to you. This should be developed further in the next few
weeks into a full draft, which should include the same topics as the oral
presentation (see above) as well as a literature review of related projects
done previously; an outline of your search for relevant data; and a rough
draft of a project flow chart. This first draft of your paper is due in Class
8, and will be returned with comments. The final project proposal paper is due
in Class 13, and should contain about 3,000-5,000 words.

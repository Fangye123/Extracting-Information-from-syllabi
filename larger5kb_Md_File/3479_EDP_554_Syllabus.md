## 2\. Background to Course

**

> Prerequisites:**

>       1. EDP 552 or a comparable course, competence in simple regression,
and exposure to multiple regression and ANOVA; understanding of the logic of
statistical tests and familiarity with simple tests such as t-tests for
comparing means.  
[yeah, yeah, Im sick of the jokes that follow too.]

>       2. Previous experience with computer use (or an ability to rectify the
deficit quickly).

>       3. Previous work in epistemology or philosophy of science OR
experience with the real world.

>       4. Previous work in research methods or statistics OR ever having
wondered why or if something was true or false.

>       5. Previous work in statistics or mathematics or a fear of either.

>       6. An attitude and set of behaviors that reflect valuing of
scholarship and understanding.

**

Goal:**

    The goal of this course is allow participants to be able to compute (via computer) and interpret multiple-regression and Analysis of Variance techniques and to begin developing competencies for planning research studies. Because the goal is to be able to do data analysis (and not just talk about it) we must do it in class, in homework, and on tests. The computer is likely to be your best friend. 
** Individual Differences:**

    Any participant in this course who has a disability that may prevent him or her from fully demonstrating his or her abilities should contact me personally as soon as possible so we can discuss accommodations necessary to ensure full participation and facilitate your educational process. 
**

> Philosophy:**

**

>       1. This course is about empowering **participants to take charge of
interpreting and assessing quantitative information. We live in a quantitative
world. The more you know, the less you can be manipulated by jerks who know
the language but may or may not know appropriate interpretation.

**

>       2. Participants must work like dogs** to learn this. Anyone I know
that understands anything well has worked their butt off to do it. This course
is no different.

**

>       3. Learning all the details is not enough**. Participants should ask
themselves about the bigger questions, seek clarifications, root out
contradictions -- use all the reasoning skills you would be expected to use in
any other class.

>       4. To be worthwhile, this must be connected to what you, or someone
you know, does or will be doing. **Only you can make it relevant to your
experience**. Ask and prod the instructor as needed.

**

>       5. This course is not about mathematics.** This course is about
rigorous thinking that uses the tools of mathematics. If you are too freaked
out by math to think straight in class, you should consider work through the
course once without a grade (auditing).

>       6. A good understanding can be had by almost all, an excellent
understanding takes a very special effort.

## 3\. Achieving Success

### How to Fail this Class:

>       1. Take a lot of other courses or obligations

>       2. Listen to your study group instead of your head

>       3. Memorize facts, avoid focusing on understanding or meaning.

>       4. Do not ask questions-office hours are only for nerds

>       5. Share your papers with a friend :)

>       6. Do not do more problems than what have been assigned

>       7. Wait till the weekend to think about the class

### Requirements:

>       1. Participation in Class (this includes joining the class listserve -
see below)

>       2. Completing homework assignments

>       3. Successfully complete 3 papers

>       4. Succesfully complete midterm and final

>       5. Participate in research activity or write 2 page summary of entry
in Encyclopedia of Statistical Science

### Grading:

> Participation in class and completion of assignments is expected, but not
graded. Grades will be based on scores on paper projects you hand in. Paper 1:
20 pts; Paper 2 & 3 each 40 pts, Midterm and Final each 50 pts.

> 93% or higher-----> Excellent--> A  
>  80 % to 92 %--> Good------> B  
>  70 % to 79 %-> Average----> C  
>  60 % to 69 %-> Passing----> D  
>  Below 60 %--------> Failure----> E

>  

> A grade of "I" for incomplete is only given for "illness or other conditions
beyond the student's control" (ASU General Catalog pg 45).

### Class Listserve

> To promote class discussion between class meetings, we will create a class
listserve. This email discussion group can be joined by send a blank message
to
[edp554-request@research1.ed.asu.edu](mailto:edp554-request@research.ed.asu.edu)
with the single word subscribe in the subject line. All students are expected
to participate by checking their mail weekly. Everyone that has an account to
use in class has email access.

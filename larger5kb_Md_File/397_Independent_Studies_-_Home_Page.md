![](images/s_sanderson_welcome.jpg) Dear Friends:  
  
Welcome to the Department of Independent Studies at Kendall Campus! Please
allow me to share with you some of the important features of our department.
Presently our department offers 56 college credit courses in a broad array of
academic disciplines, including the natural sciences and mathematics, the
social sciences and sociology, English composition and literature, business
and management, history and anthropology, humanities and music, and psychology
and education. Independent Studies course offerings include all general
education requirements, as well as academic electives and distribution
courses. We have courses that meet requirements for the Associate in Arts
degree, the Associate in Science degree, planned certificate programs, and
teacher certification/re-certification.  
  
The Department of Independent Studies provides the perfect delivery system for
many Miami-Dade students. Most of our courses require only four or five visits
to the campus for course completion, and dedicated faculty are available to
assist you day, evening, and weekend hours. You may also contact your
professors and receive timely responses via. e-mail and fax. A complete
syllabus is provided for each course. It includes a detailed description of
required readings and assignments, a calendar of suggested dates for testing
and the submission of your academic work, and other learning activities to be
completed according to your own schedule.  
  
If you are a busy person with a desire to earn college credits and you need a
flexible schedule, the Department of Independent Studies is for you. Please
see our current department information presented on this website. Once you
have familiarized yourself with our program, I think you will be convinced
that the Department of Independent Studies can meet your academic needs. For
additional information, come by Room 3306, call us at 305-237-2337, or e-mail
me at [ssanders@mdcc.edu](mailto:ssanders@mdcc.edu.) I welcome your inquiries
and look forward to your success.  
  
Sincerely yours,  
  
Sara Lee Sanderson, Ed.D.  
Chairperson, Dept. of Independent Studies

### How Does Independent Studies Work?

Once you have registered and paid for your Independent Studies classes, it's
time to look at the procedures you will follow to successfully complete your
courses.  
  
During the first week of the term you will come to the department, Rooms
3307-3309, to meet with your professor, sign a contract, and receive your
course syllabus. Current faculty schedules are listed under the Download
Center, and they are also available in our department office, Room 3306. Be
sure to come during scheduled hours.  
  
After you have signed a contract with your professor, you are expected to
adhere to all course procedures and test deadlines presented in the course
syllabus.  
  
Keep in mind that department professors are available only during scheduled
teaching hours for testing and other in-person assessments. They also provide
individual assistance and advisement during scheduled office hours. No
appointments are necessary during scheduled teaching and office hours.  
  
At the end of the term your professor will assign the final grade you have
earned. If you follow the procedures outlined above, I know you will be
successful.  
  

> **TIP:** To save time and avoid making unnecessary trips to the campus, keep
your instructor's scheduled hours, telephone/fax numbers, and e-mail address
handy so you can directly communicate on a regular basis.

  

####  Enjoy your journey!

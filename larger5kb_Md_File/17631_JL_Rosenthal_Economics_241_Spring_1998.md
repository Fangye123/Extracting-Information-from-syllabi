Economic History of Western Europe

Requirements: Each student will be responsible for two short in-class
presentations; in each case a one page summary must be submitted in writing,
there will also be a final paper. The paper (about seven pages) should
demonstrate your ability to write a creative criticism of part of the
literature. Paper topics must be submitted Week 7 of the quarter. Drafts
submitted before Week 9 will be read, annotated and returned promptly. All
papers are due the last day of classes. No extensions will be given !!! As
always class participation is essential.

The reading is organized broadly by week within sections and may change.

All required reading is marked with a ¡¤ , but it is unlikely that we will
cover all the sections of the syllabus. Other readings below the dashed lines
are optional. Readings marked with a + are general discussions or reference
works that have become classics.

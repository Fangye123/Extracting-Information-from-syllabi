_Description  
_ This course explores the making of the United States since 1877. We will
examine the profound transformations that the country has undergone since the
late nineteenth century. Departing from the post-Civil War failure of
Reconstruction and the nascence of the Gilded Age, we will trace events and
processes including the Spanish-American war, the reformist impulse of the
Progressive era, the complacency and domesticity of the 1950s, the
rebelliousness of civil rights movements in the 1960s, and conclude by taking
stock of the current economic boom of the "information" age. We will also
focus on continuous themes in United States history such as racism; struggles
over ethnic, social, and sexual identity; work and the family; contested
meanings and uses of land and the environment; and imperialism and involvement
in foreign relations.

_Course Requirements_  
1\. Attendance: Regular attendance and participation in class discussion is
exceedingly important, completely expected, and will be taken by the
instructor promptly at 8:05. In the sections, your TA will lead a general
discussion based on primary sources in the Documents Reader. Attendance will
count towards 20% of your evaluation or grade. If you miss more than two
classes and one discussion section, you will need to contact me and/or your TA
to provide an explanation for your absence.  
2\. [Weekly Response Papers](Assignments/index.htm): Most weeks you will
submit a 2-3 page paper responding to primary sources. The aim of these papers
is for you to contextualize voices from the past in the broader historical
moment. I will hand out questions on Wednesday and the papers will be due the
following Monday. These will count towards 20% of your evaluation or grade.
Late papers will not be accepted after Wednesday. NO ATTACHMENTS!  
3\. [Midterm Exam](Exams/25bmidterm.htm): Students will be required to hand in
a mid-term exam in the sixth week of class. You will answer a set of
definitions (5) as well as two fairly short essay questions (3-4 pages each
and you will be given a choice). This will count towards 25% of your
evaluation or grade. NO ATTACHMENTS!  
4\. [Final exam:](Exams/25bfinal.htm) Students will be required to hand in a
final exam by 5pm on Monday, March 19. You will drop your exam in a marked box
at Merrill Faculty Services. The exam will be cumulative, drawing from all the
course materials covered. You will respond to a set of definitions (5 out of
10) and three essay questions (3-4 pages each). This will count towards 35% of
your evaluation or grade. NO ATTACHMENTS!

### Description

_World Politics_ provides an overview of the field of international relations.
It is neither a review of contemporary international history nor a discussion
of current events. Rather, we survey a variety of perspectives, frameworks,
theories, and hypotheses which help to make sense of both history and current
events. Topics to be covered include state sovereignty, power and hegemony,
foreign policymaking, armament and disarmament, peacekeeping, international
political economy, international law, and war and morality. This is primarily
a lecture course, but class discussion will allow for further exploration of
the most interesting and controversial topics.

_World Politics_ is one of ten foundation courses in the [General Education
Program's](http://www.gened.american.edu/) Curricular Area 3, "International
and Intercultural Experience." You may complete the two-course sequence by
taking one of following second-level courses:

  * COMM-280, Contemporary Media in a Global Society 
  * GOVT-434, London Semester (Study Abroad) 
  * HIST-225, Russia: Past and Present 
  * HIST-260, To Arms: People and Nations at War 
  * IBUS-200, The Global Marketplace 
  * LFS-200, Russia and the United States 
  * LFS-210, Latin America: History, Art, Literature 
  * SIS-215, Competition in an Interdependent World 
  * SIS-372, Brussels Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * SIS-375, Berlin Seminar (Study Abroad) 
  * SOCY-225, Contemporary Arab World 
Each of these courses explores in more depth a topic introduced by _World
Politics_. You can enhance the learning experience of this foundation course
by further study in one of the areas you find most interesting.

  

### Requirements and Evaluation

Course grades are based in part on a midterm (20%) and a comprehensive final
(30%) examination. These examinations consist of questions requiring both
short answers and longer essays. You will also have two short research
assignments, both culminating in a 5-6 page [paper](papertop.html) (each worth
20%). The remainder of your course grade (10%) will be based on your
participation in class discussion. Attendance is required.

  

### Reading Materials

Readings are assigned from the following course books, available at the
[Campus Store](http://www.bookstore.american.edu/):

  * [ _International Relations_](http://gurukul.ucc.american.edu/goldtext/jghome.htm), third edition, by Joshua S. Goldstein (text). 
  * _At the Helm: Foreign Policy Choices in a Turbulent World_ , edited by Joshua S. Goldstein (reader). 

In addition to the text and the reader, you should be reading, on a regular
basis, the [_Washington Post_](http://www.washingtonpost.com/), the [_New York
Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/), or some other newspaper with thorough
international coverage. Your performance in the course will reflect your
familiarity with current international issues, and not just an understanding
of lecture and textbook materials.

  

### Academic Integrity

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, plagiarism, unauthorized possession of
examinations, and alteration of grades or markings on returned work. These and
other forms of academic dishonesty are discussed in AU's _Academic Integrity
Code_. If you are in doubt especially about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting,
or collaboration, please consult me. Any examination or assignment tainted by
academic dishonesty will automatically receive a _grade of F_. University
regulations _require_ that the incident be reported to the Dean of the School
of International Service, who will determine the appropriateness of further
disciplinary action.

## LECTURE & READING SCHEDULE

Lectures and assigned readings are both complementary and supplementary;
neither is a substitute for the other. Pages from the books should be read
prior to the lecture for which they are assigned. It is especially important
that you be familiar with articles assigned from the reader, since these will
often become the basis for class discussion. We will try to adhere to the
following schedule (but check the course webpage for changes):

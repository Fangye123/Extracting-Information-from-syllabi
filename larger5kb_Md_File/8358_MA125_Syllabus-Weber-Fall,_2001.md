# MA125 Elementary Discrete Mathematics  
Syllabus

## [Weber](http://www.muc.edu/~weberk)/Fall, 2001

### Course Description

There are many ways to categorize the topics falling under the main category
of mathematics.  One way to categorize the topics is by whether or not the
mathematics deals with **discrete** or **continuous** properties of things.
The number of steps I may take to walk from my office to the classroom is a
discrete value, whereas the distance in feet I would travel from my office to
the classroom is a continuous value.  Each step I take is distinct from all
other steps, and can be measured (or counted) in discrete, indivisible, units.
The distance, on the other hand, is a different type of value.  For example, I
can always imagine exactly half the distance from my office to the classroom
(even if I cannot in real life measure it exactly), but it becomes more
difficult to think of exactly half the number of steps it takes me to get from
my office to the classroom-what is half of 121 steps?  60 and one-half steps?
How can I naturally walk 60 and one-half steps?  Even if one could think in
terms of half-steps, the difficulty becomes clearer if you want to divide my
trip into 13 stages with the same number of steps in each stage.  How can I
take 9 and four-thirteenths of a step?  On the other hand, we can think
naturally of subdividing 121 feet into 13 stages, each  9 and 4/13 feet long.
Maybe we can distinguish between a continuous value and a discrete value by
asking whether or not it makes sense to subdivide it indefinitely.

The title of the course indicates that we will  be studying discrete
mathematics.  (Calculus is a course in which continuous mathematics is
studied).  Topics include

  * Logic and proof (how to write down the reasons you believe something is true in a careful way, so that you can convince someone else it is true) 
  * Combinatorics (how to count things in an organized way) 
  * Graphs and trees (ways of distilling the important facts of a complicated problem to dots interconnected with lines) 
  * Recurrence relations (simple self-referential formulas that produce complicated patterns of numbers)

These topics are actually useful in real life; they show up in computer
programming, drug design, and political analysis, among other human endeavors.

The actual catalog course description can be found by going to the [MUC on-
line catalog](https://neon.muc.edu/Student/CommAccess/CrsCatal.asp) and
searching for MA 125.

### **Goals**

The goal of the course is to introduce students to logic and proof,
combinatorics, graphs and trees, and recurrence relations, and that they will
be able to recognize situations in which they may be able to use these
mathematical tools to solve real-life problems.

### **Expected learning outcomes**

  * Students will be able to understand arguments given in logical form.
  * Students will be able to understand simple proofs of propositions in elementary number theory.
  * Students will be able to show that simple algorithms work correctly through the use of  pre- and post-conditions, loop invariants and mathematical induction. 
  * Students will be able to construct a graph to represent the facts of some real-life situation, then answer questions about the situation.
  * Students will be able to use simple combinatorics techniques to indirectly count the number of objects in some set.

Each of these outcomes will be assessed by tests given over the material in
question.

### Course Web Page

The course web page at <http://www.muc.edu/~weberk/Fall01/MA125/index.htm>
contains announcements, homework assignments, and other pertinent information.
It should be consulted regularly.

### Textbook

_Discrete Mathematics with Applications,_ 2nd edition, by Susanna S. Epp; PWS
Publishing. We will cover the following sections as time permits:

**Topic** | **Sections**  
---|---  
Logic  | 1.1-1.4  
2.1-2.3  
Proof  
| ~~3.1-3.4, 3.6~~   3.1, 3.3, 3.4  
4.1-2, 4.5  
Combinatorics | 6.1-3  
Recurrence relations | 8.1-2  
Graphs and trees | 11.1, 11.5  
  
### Homework

I will assign homework problems for each section from the textbook. In order
to do well in the course, they must be taken seriously.  Feel free to ask me
to check over any of these problems, but otherwise I will not expect you to
turn them in, and no grade will be assigned for these.

I will assign four sets of homework problems for which I expect you to turn in
written solutions.  You may work together on written homework problems; if so,
each person you worked with on a given problem must be mentioned in the
written solution of the problem.  (It is important that you **understand** the
solution; otherwise you may not do well on a quiz or test question.)  

A written homework assignment will **not** be accepted after the first quiz or
test over the topics covered on the assignment has been given.

Any assigned homework may be presented to the class for **extra credit** ;
each such presentation will be worth 10 points.  Any one student is limited to
3 presentations through the course of the semester.

A unique homework problem will be given each student during the last week of
class, and due at the final exam.  A complete correct solution of this problem
will be worth 30 points **extra credit**.

### Calculators and other aids

Calculators are certainly allowed, even on tests. I reserve the right to
prohibit calculators on some quizzes. In addition, for each quiz you may
prepare a study sheet of dimensions 5.5" x 8.5", and an 8.5" x 11" study sheet
for the midterm and final exam; each sheet must be less than 0.125" thick.
These sheets will not only help organize your preparation, but also may be
referred to during the test.

### Attendance

Each student is responsible for material covered and announcements given in
each class session. Attendance will not be recorded.

In order to make up the midterm or quizzes a reasonable excuse must be given.
The policy for making up final exams is very strict; refer to the College
Catalog.  The **final exam** for this course is scheduled for **Monday,
December 10, from 1 pm to 4 pm.**

### Evaluation

Final grades will be based on a raw numerical score obtained by weighting
grades on assignments and exams according to the following:

Four homework assignments @ 50 points each | 200 points  
---|---  
Three quizzes (25 minutes long) @100 points each | 300 points  
Test (50 minutes) | 200 points  
Comprehensive final exam | 300 points  
**Total** | **1000 points**  
  
Students who achieve at least 900 points will be guaranteed at least an A for
the course, 800-899 a B, 700-799 a C, and 600-699 a D.  I may choose to lower
the lower boundary on each letter grade, and also  reserve the right to award
plus and minus grades for borderline cases.  Extra credit points will be added
to the total scores **after** any adjustments to the lower boundaries are
done.

### Honors

This course may be taken for honors in Computer Science or Information
Systems.  An [application form](http://www.muc.edu/Honors/appendix.htm) must
be filled out and turned in by the end of the third week.  See the[ college
catalog](http://www.muc.edu/registrar/catalog/academics.html#hmp), the [honors
program home page](http://www.muc.edu/Honors/index.htm), and the instructor
for further details.

### Plagiarism

Although students are expected to work alone on in-class quizzes and exams, it
is useful and permissible to discuss homework assignments. **However, each
student must produce their own version of any homework assignment.**

Refer also to the section on academic honesty in the College Catalog.

### [Disability Support](http://www.muc.edu/cs/disability.html)

Any student with a documented disability needing academic accommodations is
requested to speak with Disability Support Services (Room 109 Hoover-Price
Campus Center) and the instructor, as early in the semester as possible. All
discussions will remain confidential.

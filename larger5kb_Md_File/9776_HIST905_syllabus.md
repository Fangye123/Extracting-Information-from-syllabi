II. **Weekly Essays.**

Each week's assignment will include a written essay. These will vary from week
to week and suggestions will be specified in the class prior to the week's
assignment. This will allow for adjustment according to the interests and
needs of the class. A typical assignment might consist of two parts: a one-
page outline of the political chronology under consideration and a two-page
commentary on the monograph assigned for the week. Sometimes one week's
assignment will entail an expansion or a revision of a previous assignment.
Some essays will be comparative in nature, allowing you to contrast the
approach of two or more historians to a single subject. The weekly essays will
be relatively short, generally three pages in length. Unless otherwise
specified, take three pages, double spaced, as the specified length.

III. **Final Project**

**Option I: An Outline for an Undergraduate Course.**

Many weekly assignments will include a task of creating chronological outlines
which will eventually come to be parts of a course outline. By the end of the
semester, these should be revised in a manner which results in a 15-week plan
for a course designed for the advanced undergraduate level: History of Europe,
1789-1890.

**_Organization_** : Each participant will determine the organization of
material which fits his or her best notions of what is important about the
nineteenth century. For the sake of congruity in the class, each syllabus
should consist of fifteen topics, one for each week during a semester. A
forthright attempt should be made to include the entire chronology, however,
choices will clearly have to be made about the particular subject matter used
to introduce students to the prominent issues. The decisions should be made
consciously, and they should be justified. It is expected that each syllabus
will have a particular focus, such as social history, political history,
gender-based history, or military history, but the goal is to offer a
comprehensive view of major developments of the nineteenth century.

Seminar members are encouraged to include one or more topics not emphasized in
the course, for example geo-political areas about which no monograph was
included in the course syllabus, such as the Hapsburg Empire, Russia or Spain.
Another example would be a technological development such as railroads, or a
cultural theme such as the development of compulsory education, which
significantly impacted the lives of nineteenth-century Europeans.

_**Specification of Content:**_ Each topic or unit should include a short
outline of the historical events to be presented. A simple and appropriate
guideline to use in creating the outline is the question, "what information
should students be asked to encounter in relation to this topic?"

_**Specification of Interpretation:**_ Each topic or unit must include a
statement indicating the major interpretation(s) the author of the syllabus
wishes to communicate to students in connection the particular subject. This
statement should make reference to historians' work on which it rests. A
guideline to use in connection with this part of the assignment is the
question, "how shall I help students make sense of this material?" This will
be answered by individual class members in very different ways. It is vital,
however, that each course outline be constructed with an awareness of modern
historical scholarship.

_**Bibliography**_. Each unit or topic must include a bibliography in two
parts: (a) works consulted in creating this syllabus, usually consisting of
those read in the course and (b) works you consider it important to read or
consult in connection with further preparation in this area. Frequently such
works will be cited in class sessions, but you should not limit yourself to
these. Bibliographies should include selected works which are important in
terms of methodology or interpretation.  

**Option II: Your individually designed project.**

A project which allows you to pursue your professional historical interests
related to nineteenth-century Europe. The project should be of a scope similar
to the one outlined as Option I. It should complement or supplement the
material of the course. Details to be agreed upon.

IV. **Grading and Participation.**

The primary factors in grading will be the weekly papers (combined, 75%) and
the comprehensive syllabus (25%). Attendance and active participation in
discussion are expected. The latter will constitute an informal element in
grading. Attendance will be a factor only in the case of three or more
absences. Three absences will lower a grade by a letter, and each additional
absence by an increment of one-third letter. Late papers will be assigned a
grade one letter lower than they otherwise would earn if handed in by the
third day after the due date, and grades will continue to decline by
increments of one-third letter for each additional day late. I hope and expect
that none of these negative factors will come into play for any class members.

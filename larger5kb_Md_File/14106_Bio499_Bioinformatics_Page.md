#  BIOINFORMATICS - BIOLOGY 499



**_SYLLABUS AND READING ASSIGNMENTS_**

** **

** **

**_Purpose and Prerequisites for this Course:_** **** This course presents a
broad overview and

introduction to the cell and molecular domains of the new field of
bioinformatics. It is part of an

intended three course series and so will not contain an introduction to the
field, ecological, or

phylogenetic domains of bioinformatics. We would like to acknowledge that a
grant from

CSUPERB (the California State University Program for Education and Research in
Biotechnology)

helped fund preparation for the course and purchase of the computer lab.
Although we will provide brief introductions, we recommend that students
already have a good foundation in genetics,

evolution, and a strong interest in computers and their use in computational
and systems biology

before taking this course.



** **

**_Lecturers:_** **** This first test offering of Bioinformatics will be team-
taught by five professors from three

departments, Biology, Chemistry, and Computer Science. They are:

，         Dr. Wei-Jen Lin (Microbiology)

，         Dr. Sep Eskandari (Physiology)

，         Dr. Chung Lee (Computer Science)

，         Dr. Dennis Livesay (Biochemistry)

，         Dr. Len Troncale (Cell and Molecular Biology)



Bioinformatics is a rapidly developing, rigorously interdisciplinary new
specialty, and we believe that

this team approach will result in better coverage. Each professor will present
two weeks of lecture. ****

** **

**_Place and Time:_** **** Lectures and lab exercises are Monday and Wednesday
from 6pm to 8 pm in

Building 4-2-451. The computer lab may be used at other times to complete
exercises if and when

supervision is available (most likely on Fridays). ****

**_Guiding Questions_** answered in this course include:

，         What is the history of bioinformatics and can we trace trends for
its future development from

study of its recent development?

，         How does bioinformatics incorporate and use the fundamental concepts
of genome, genetic

information transfer, the molecular biology of DNA, RNA, and proteins, and the
fundamental

principles of molecular evolution?

，         What is the present utility of bioinformatics to basic research in
medicine and biology?

，         What are the differences between genomics, proteomics, and
physiognomics?

，         What is the practical economic and professional development benefit
of student

specialization in bioinformatics?

，         How can a student use the techniques and tools of bioinformatics in
conducting their own

undergraduate or graduate research at Cal Poly Pomona?

，         Which are the main bioinformatic databases and what are their basic
features?

，         What is the meaning and significance of the plethora of acronyms
used in bioinformatics?

，         What are the most useful sequence analysis software tools and how
can I use them?

use them?

，         What are the most useful gene identification tools and how can I use
them?

，         How is bioinformatics used to build molecular phylogenies?

，         How is bioinformatics used to explore protein families,
superfamilies, and motifs?

，         How can we discover relationships between stereo structures or
simulate protein structure?

，         How do computer algorithms work to accomplish the searches and
comparisons of bioinformatics?

，         How do bioinformatic algorithms relate to SQL, JAVA, MS-Access and
other software domains?

，         What are the current research questions in comparative physiological
networks (physiological

genomics)?

，         What techniques and tools can I use to study interactions among
protein products and regulatory

elements?

，         What are the meanings of functional genomics and pharmacogenetics?

，         What are the biological uses of functional genomics and
pharmacogenetics?



**_Text Assignments:_** The textbook for this course is _Bioinformatics:
Sequence and Genome Analysis_ by D.W. Mount, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory
Press, 2001.  For students who cannot obtain the first text, or

for students who want to begin their own library we have also selected a
secondary text.

_Bioinformatics: A Practical Guide to the Analysis of Genes and Proteins_ ,
edited by A.D. Baxevanis

and B.F. Ouellette, 2nd Edition, Wiley-Interscience, 2001. This specialty is
so new that a definitive, or

even widely accepted text has not yet been written. We believe the first text
explains the material more

completely. Where possible professors will provide either handouts of their
presentation notes or will post

them on the Cal Poly Pomona Intranet CT-Website for the course.



**_Website URL:_**    Many of the links described in the course, as well as
copies of this syllabus, and

assigned exercises can be found at:

<http://webct.csupomona.edu/SCRIPT/bio499/scripts/serve_home>

This URL will require your e-mail name and SSN as a password. Only students
registered for the

class will be listed as users. Many other URL's will be assigned during the
course.



**_Reading Assignments:_** The following reading assignments are organized
according to the

progression of lectures by the team of professors. Since the assignments
follow the lectures,

reading assignments sometimes jump around in the text. Ideally, you should
read the text assignment

both before and after lectures on the topic, and you are encouraged to read
the entire chapter not just

the excerpt selected to understand the material according to the continuity-
in-context provided by the

author of the text.  Only the main subtitles of the lectures are included
here; the more complete

outlines can be found in handouts at lecture time, or on the course website.
Since this is the first test

offering of the course, please note that professor outlines are often still in
development. We welcome

suggestion for improvement. Every serious student should be familiar with
definitions of technical

terms covered in the presentations and found in the Glossary (pp. 533-546) by
the end of the quarter. ****

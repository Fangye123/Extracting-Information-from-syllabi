**Description**

This seminar explores the social, economic, and environmental implications of
suburbs and the role they play in American  
culture - past, present, and future.  Drawing from the disciplines of
sociology, economics, political science, geography, urban  
planning and design, we will consider such themes as the myth of the suburban
dream, racism and urban flight, the  
privatization of public spaces, the subsidization of suburbanization, media
depictions of suburbia, suburbia and the feminist  
movement, and proposed alternatives to suburban sprawl.

The first third of the course will cover the historical development of
suburbs, including the eras of streetcar suburbs and  
garden cities.  Many of the characteristics of today's suburbs can be traced
back to these earlier times.  The second third  
of the course will focus on the suburban boom that followed World War II, the
accompanying societal changes, and the  
growing outcry against suburbia.  The final third of the course will turn to
today's suburbs, exploring what they have become  
and what they might become.

Throughout the semester, we will consider the pros and cons of suburbia, the
arguments in favor of suburbanization and  
the criticisms against it, and how these have evolved over time.  We will
explore the forces behind suburbanization and  
the interplay between public policy and action, private enterprise and
speculation, and the consumers of suburbia.  We  
will reflect on the dynamic between the nature of place and the nature of
community, how people shape places and how  
places shape people.  Our goal is not ultimately to praise or condemn
Suburbia, rather to better understand both its causes  
and consequences.

**Requirements**

I expect students to complete all assigned readings, attend class, participate
in class discussions, and complete all writing  
assignments.

Three books are required for this course and are available at the Co-op:

Kenneth Jackson.  Crabgrass Frontier (1985)  
Ewen and Baxandall.  Picture Windows (2000)  
Ross Andrew.  The Celebration Chronicles (1999)

The following books will be on reserve in the Undergraduate Library:

Sam B. Warner.  Streetcar Suburbs (1962, 1978)  
Herbert Gans.  The Levittowners (1967)

In addition, the course reader is available at Jenn¨ªs Copies at 2200 Guadalupe
Street (473-8669).

The schedule of reading assignments and discussion topics is outlined below.
Each class day, I will provide students with  
discussion questions or short assignments for the next class.  I expect
students to come to class prepared for that day's  
discussion.  The format of these discussions will vary and may include small
group discussions, debates, or various other  
kinds of activities.  I expect students to speak and listen thoughtfully and
considerately.

I will hand out detailed descriptions of the paper assignments during the
semester.  In Paper 1 (3-4 pages), students will  
reflect on the communities in which they grew up and the ways in which their
communities shaped the persons they are  
today.  Students will submit a rewrite of Paper 1 after receiving comments
from me.  For Paper 2 (5-6 pages), students will  
choose an historical issue from the readings or class discussions.  The paper
must develop and support a clear thesis and  
must use at least two primary historical sources.  Students will also submit a
rewrite of Paper 2.  For Paper 3 (8-10 pages)  
students will choose a current issue about Suburbia and will conduct some form
of primary research on their issue, such as  
analysis of census data, a short survey, or observations of people or places.
For both Papers 2 and 3, students will first turn  
in a topic proposal describing their initial thesis and a progress report
describing the research they expect to use to support  
that thesis.

I will grade all three papers on the clarity and quality of the thesis or
theme, the logic of the argument (including organization  
and supporting evidence), and the clarity of language (including wording and
grammar).  Students must include citations for  
all sources using one of the standard citation formats (e.g. The Chicago
Manual of Style, available in the reference section of  
most libraries).  I expect students to turn in clean, well-formatted, spell-
checked print outs of their papers.

 The due dates for papers will be as follows:

Paper 1 First version  February 12  
  Rewrite  February 26

Paper 2 Proposal  February 19  
  Progress Report March 5  
  Final Paper  March 26  
  Rewrite  April 9

Paper 3 Proposal  April 2  
  Progress Report April 16  
  Final Paper  May 4

In addition, students will give a short (5-10 minute) presentation of their
Paper 3 to the class during the last week of classes  
(April 30 and May 2).  I expect students to prepare carefully for their
presentations, including practicing and timing their  
presentations.  I will grade presentations on the clarity of the thesis, the
logic of the presentation, and the quality of the  
delivery.

I will also give a short final exam during the scheduled exam period.  The
exam will test students on their comprehension of  
key concepts and themes from throughout the course and will ask them to
provide their own reflections on selected issues.  
The exam should not require extensive study time.

Rest assured that I will leave ample time in class to discuss and clarify the
assignments.  In addition, every student should  
come to my office hours at least once to discuss each assignment (i.e. at
least three times during the semester).

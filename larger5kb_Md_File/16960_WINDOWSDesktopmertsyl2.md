> **Revolution and American Identity**

>

> From 1776 on, the ideals and myths surrounding the Revolution have been
invoked repeatedly to explain American institutions and identity--or who we
are as a people. This course is an introduction to the principal writings and
interpretations of the era of the American Revolution from the early
eighteenth century to the ratification of the Federal Constitution of 1787.
Our weekly readings and class discussions will focus especially on eighteenth-
century American society and culture; the British Empire and its relationship
to the colonies; the ideological underpinnings of the independence movement;
the effects of revolution on women, African Americans, and Native Americans;
popular political actions; and the attempts to create new forms of government
in the aftermath of the war.

>

> Besides providing an overview of the Revolutionary period in America, the
course also seeks to train students in the arts and habits of critical thought
and expression. We will spend class time discussing current historical
interpretations and analyzing primary source material. This is not a lecture
course, though some essential background material will be provided. Class
participation is required.

> Courage! Honor! Intensity! Valor! Amor! Lances! Romance! Youth! = CHIVALRY
In these lectures, we study the development of chivalric mentality in
literature and thought from the Middle Ages to modern times. This course
starts with the flowering of chivalry in the twelfth-century West. Stories of
King Arthur form the central thread around which we weave studies of chivalric
education and variation, of chivalric rejection and renewal.

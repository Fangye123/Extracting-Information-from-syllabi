    GOVERNMENT INCLUDING PROBLEMS OF LEADERSHIP, TRIBAL POLITICS,
    INTERGOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS AND TRIBAL ENTERPRISES. 
    
    **COURSE PHILOSOPHY**
    
         TO PROVOKE INQUIRY AND ASSESSMENT OF THE ROLE OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS
    AS THEY FUNCTION WITHIN THE COMPLEXITY OF FEDERAL-STATE-TRIBAL
    RELATIONSHIPS AND POLICIES; PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH A BASIS TO STIMULATE
    FURTHER RESEARCH AND INVESTIGATION INTO THE AREAS OF INDIAN LAW,
    GOVERNMENT, AND POLITICS; AND ENCOURAGE STUDENTS TO THINK ABOUT THEIR
    CURRENT AND FUTURE ROLES AS CITIZENS AND THEIR INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE
    RESPONSIBILITIES. 
    
         TO FULFILL CONSCIENTIOUSLY ALL ASSIGNMENTS AND OTHER ACADEMIC
    OBLIGATIONS OF THIS COURSE.  TO BE REGULAR AND PUNCTUAL IN ATTENDANCE AND
    FOLLOW CLASS PROCEDURES.  TO MAINTAIN A SCHOLARLY ATMOSPHERE IN CLASS AND
    MAINTAIN ACADEMIC INTEGRITY.  ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT (CHEATING, PLAGIARISM,

    INSTRUCTORS AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE IF PREVENTED FROM KEEPING AN APPOINTMENT
    OR CARRYING OUT AN ASSIGNMENT.  TO DISCUSS WITH THE INSTRUCTORS ANY CLASS-
    RELATED PROBLEMS. 
    
         THE EMPHASIS IN THIS COURSE IS ON PARTICIPATION AND COOPERATIVE

    OF STYLE ARE SOME OF THE MORE POPULAR.  USE DOUBLE SPACING, ONE INCH
    MARGIN SETTINGS, AND 10 OR 12 CPI TYPE SIZE.  DO NOT STRETCH OR SHRINK
    SPACE LENGTH WITH THE SPACING OF THE TEXT.  YOU MAY USE A COVER PAGE, BUT
    PLEASE DO NOT USE TERM PAPER COVERS OR OTHER BINDINGS.  PLEASE SUBMIT THE

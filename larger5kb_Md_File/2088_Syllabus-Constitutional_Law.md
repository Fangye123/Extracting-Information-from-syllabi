**COURSE OBJECTIVE**

constitutional cases and concepts in areas such as judicial review,
federalism, the separation of powers, and checks and balances.  
  
  
**TEXTBOOKS**

  * _American Constitutional Law/Volume I: The Structure of Government,_ by Ralph A. Rossum and G. Alan Tarr (RT).

**CLASS HOME PAGE**  
  
My home page provides a number of resources that may prove useful to students.
These include copies of course syllabi, [Politics _Alive!_](polalive.html),
and various [Learning Resources](learning.html) to assist in the completion of
assignments. The address of the site is:

**COURSE CONDUCT, REQUIREMENTS, AND EXPECTATIONS**  
  

  1. This course will follow both the lecture and case study approach to constitutional law. Specific **reading assignments** will be made in class. Each student is expected to have read all assigned materials prior to class. Reading quizzes may be given if it becomes apparent that reading assignments are not being met.  
  

  2. **Participation** in class discussions is expected and will be figured in the final grade.  
  

  3. **Attendance** problems will be reported to the Dean of the College and may seriously affect the final grade. Excessive absences may result in my dropping a student from this course.  
  

  4. There will be two **examinations**. Each of the tests will consist of both objective and subjective questions. Unless otherwise directed, students will complete examinations independently. Failure to do so will result in the immediate failure of this course.  
  

  5. **Make-up exams** will be given only in accordance with Illinois College policy. If a make-up is given, I retain the right to modify substantially both the content and the format of the exam. If a student is unable to take an exam for a legitimate reason, he/she must contact me personally prior to the administration of the exam. **Without prior notification and approval, a make-up exam will NOT be given.** Messages left via e-mail or answering machines do not constitute contact, discussion, and decision. NO MAKE-UPS WILL BE GIVEN FOR QUIZZES.  
  

  6. I am happy to discuss the results of an exam or other assignment **twenty-four hours** after it has been returned.  
  

  7. All **written work** must be typed. Papers are to be double-spaced, with one-inch margins, and utilize a standard font size (e.g., 12). Each paper should include a title page and bibliography page (when applicable). When page lengths are assigned, they refer to the length of text only and do NOT include title and bibliography pages. All pages must be numbered. Pages must be proofread and neatly corrected. Unless otherwise directed, papers should be stapled rather than inserted into any type of folder. All students are encouraged to consult with the Campus Writing Center (early and often) in the design and completion of writing assignments. I am happy to work with any student in the referral process, although a referral is not required to make use of this valuable campus resource.  
  

  8. **Papers written for this class** cannot be used to complete a writing assignment for any other class. Papers previously written also cannot be submitted to complete requirements for this course.  
  

  9. **Late papers** will be penalized at the rate of one letter grade per day. Papers are due at the beginning of the class period, and penalties are assessed from that point.  
  

  10. **All assignments must be completed** to pass this course.  
  

  11. **Plagiarism** will result in the immediate failure of this course.
  
  
**WRITTEN ASSIGNMENTS**  
  
Students will complete several different writing assignments which are
designed to develop and strengthen the types of reading, thinking, and writing
skills important in the study of constitutional law.  
  

  * **Legal Briefs:** Each student will complete three (3) legal briefs. The first of these will be over the case, _Marbury_ v. _Madison_ (RT: pp. 75-78). The format for writing legal briefs appears on pages 42-45 of the text or students may refer to [Writing a Case Brief](brief.html) on the [ Learning Resources](learning.html) page of my web site. The second brief may be chosen from amongst those cases which follow on the list of cases. The third brief will be based on the Court's recent decision regarding the president's right to exercise the item veto in [ _William J. Clinton, President of the United States, et al., Appellants v. City of New York, et al.](http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/97-1374.ZO.html)_ The second and third briefs must be submitted by **November 16.**  
  

  * **Critical Book Review:** Students will write a critical book review of _Closed Chambers: The Rise, Fall, and Future of the Modern Supreme Court,_ by Edward Lazarus. Students may wish to consult [ Writing a Critical Review](review.html) on the [Learning Resources](learning.html) page of my web site. The review should be five pages and is due on **October 12.**  
  

  * **Biographic Leadership Essay:** Only sixteen persons have occupied the Chief Justiceship in the whole of American history. For a handful, their impact was negligible. But for others, their legacies are inextricably linked to some of the most important events and controversies that this nation has faced. According to Stephen L. Wasby, "the Chief Justice is expected to play a wide variety of roles. In addition to participating in the deciding of cases, writing a share of the Court's opinions, and serving as the Court's presiding officer, he serves as a circuit justice (for the D.C. and Fourth Circuits), and also is court manager, court defender, third branch chieftain, and statesman." Among his fellow justices on the Court, he may exercise key leadership in three areas: intellectual leadership, social leadership, and policy leadership. In this short essay (5-7 pages) students will select one of these chief justices and examine his effectiveness as leader of our nation's highest court. The following individuals have served as the Chief Justice of the United States:  
  

    * John Jay (1789-1795)  

    * John Rutledge (1795)  

    * Oliver Ellsworth (1796-1800)  

    * John Marshall (1801-1835)  

    * Roger Taney (1836-1864)  

    * Salmon Chase (1864-1873)  

    * Morrison Waite (1874-1888)  

    * Melville Fuller (1888-1910)  

    * Edward White (1910-1921)  

    * William Howard Taft (1921-1930)  

    * Charles Evans Hughes (1930-1941)  

    * Harlan Stone (1941-1946)  

    * Fred Vinson (1946-1953)  

    * Earl Warren (1953-1969)  

    * Warren Burger (1969-1986)  

    * William Rehnquist (1986-)  
  
Students will inform me of their choice of chief justice (first come, first
served basis). Students will share their research in class during the final
week of classes (December 11). The final draft of the paper will be due on
**December 15.**

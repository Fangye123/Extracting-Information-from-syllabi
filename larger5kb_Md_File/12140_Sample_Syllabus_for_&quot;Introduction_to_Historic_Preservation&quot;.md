>> **WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT**  
>  Historic Preservation is a way to put history to work in the real world.
Professionals in this growing field use a broad range of techniques to
encourage the renovation and re-use of historic buildings, structures and
neighborhoods. Preservationists may find employment with community groups,
museums, or government agencies.

>>

>> **Course Goals**  
>  Students who successfully complete this course will:

>>

>>   * Become familiar with the range of activities that make up the field of
Historic Preservation

>>   * Grapple with social and ethical issues: What to preserve? For whom?

>>   * Become familiar with preservation "tools," including inventories,
landmark laws, tax incentives, the National Register of Historic Places, and
the Secretary of the Interior's Standards

>>   * Know the private organizations and public agencies that assist in
preservation at the local, state and national levels.

>>   * Be able to fill out an Ohio Historic Inventory form

>>   * Develop analytical, writing and verbal skills through class discussion,
reading, and completion of an in-class report and a review essay

>>

**Lectures, readings, discussion and attendance**  
>  In this course, as in all graduate courses, you should plan on doing at
least two hours of reading and research for every one hour in the classroom.

>>

>> Readings for each session are indicated on this syllabus. Students must
complete all readings by class-time, and be ready to discuss the material in
class.

>>

>> Class participation is important. Discussion and questions are encouraged
at all times during the class period. _More than four absences will result in
the lowering of your final grade by 3 points_. Arriving late or leaving early
will count as 1/2 absence. Conversely, if you have no absences for the
quarter, I will increase your grade by 3 points.

>>

>> **Term projects**  
>  Four required exercises and one optional one will provide the opportunity
for deeper investigation:

>>

>> 1) QUIZZES:

>>      It is essential for preservationists in the field to be able to
explain to the public such basic concepts as the Criteria for the National
Register and renovation do's & don'ts under the Secretary of the Interior's
Standards. To give you practice, we'll have a "short answer" quiz after each
section of the course (5 total).

>> 2) OHIO INVENTORY FORMS:

>>      Complete an OHI form for two buildings in Downtown Youngstown. The
Mahoning Valley Historical Society and the Youngstown Central Improvement
Commission have asked us to research and inventory the downtown buildings that
the CIC owns. In addition to basic OHI research, students will comb the photo
archives at MVHS, and seek out other sources.

>> 3) RENOVATION TECH TOPIC REPORT:

>>      Read and report on a renovation topic -- restoring historic windows,
repairing plaster, stripping paint, conserving brick and stone, aiding access
for the disabled, etc. Read at least three **Preservation Briefs** or other
sources chosen in consultation with me. Write a 1-sheet summary of your
findings: I'll make copies for distribution in class. Then, on February 12 -
13, you will make a 7-minute presentation to the class.

>> 4) REVIEW ESSAY:

>>      Consult the bibliography "Graduate Readings in Historic Preservation"
(available the first week of class). Choose two books in consulation with me,
and write a 5 page "review essay." Grad students will meet together for one
hour during the week of March 10 or March 17 to discuss their readings. The
review essay is due at the beginning of that hour.

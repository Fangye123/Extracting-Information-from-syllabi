**Course Description:**

Although often studied as an abstract art, American music often finds itself
at the center of controversies involving race, politics, gender, and cultural
identity. This course will explore these intersections between American
cultural and musical life. Although the body of the course will focus on music
between the Civil War and the 1970s, we will investigate the role of music in
a wide variety of America's defining moments. These range from the role of
political songs before and during the Revolution, to the search for an
American opera in the nineteenth century, to Tin Pan Alley ethnic songs.  We
will also examine music's role in such movements as Prohibition, Abolition,
the Harlem Renaissance, and hip-hop culture. Students will be asked to
complete readings from a wide variety of scholarly sources and to demonstrate
their understanding of the course materials through class discussion, a
journal, reaction papers, and exams.  No prior musical background or training
is assumed or required.

**Course Objectives:**

We cannot possibly hope to cover all of American music history in one
semester, so this course will focus on a series of case studies, each of which
highlights a moment in American history where issues of identity intersect
with music (both classical and popular). Given that we will be exploring a
wide range of musical styles and historical topics, I expect there will be
something in the course of interest to everyone. Students are, of course,
invited to suggest other topics than those listed on the syllabus, and to
relate the topics we discuss in the class to those which affect your daily
lives. By the end of the course all successful students should:

  1. Be able to describe how American music has taken part in the defining moments of American history.
  2. Identify contemporary issues where music does, or might, play a role in issues involving race, politics, and identity.
  3. Be able to take part in an intelligent discussion of music, using terms and ideas that are common among musicians, and do so at a sophisticated level.
  4. Be able to easily identify a number of specific pieces of American music and musical styles.

**Course Materials**

Course readings and listening are available in the library. Most readings are
also available through Georgetown's electronic reserves. The listening CDs can
be found the Gelardin Center in the Library, and should be available on their
streaming server. Students are encouraged to go to the library early and make
copies of the assignments. Students must do the assignments before the class
period to which they pertain. As you can see, some weeks have very lengthy
assignments. Students are encouraged to look ahead on the syllabus and plan
accordingly.  If you are planning on not doing the assignments for this class,
or not doing them seriously, please drop the course now.

**Tips for Succeeding:**

Georgetown assumes that you will complete three hours of class time and six
hours of study time per course, per week. I will do my best to assign you four
hours of reading and listening per week, this means that you should be able to
spend at least two hours a week reviewing and thinking. If you squander this
time during the first few weeks of class, you will find the last weeks of the
semester busy and painful. If, however, you keep up on the readings and
listenings, you should have no problems achieving the aims of the course,
breezing through the exams and assignments, and still have a great time.

Since much of this course will be discussion based, it is vital that you not
only do the assigned readings and listenings before attending class, but also
spend some time thinking. Come to class with questions, comments,
disagreements, even out-right fights. The more you think, the more successful
the entire course will be, and the better grade you will earn. If you are
planning on not doing the assignments for this class, or not doing them
seriously, please drop the course now.

**Grading:** Your grade will be determined by four criteria:

  1. Attendance and Discussion: 10%  
All students are expected to attend all class meetings, and to do all
assignments **before** each class meeting. You should come to class prepared
to answer and to ask questions about the readings and music for that day.
Needless to say, you should do all assignments on time. But come to class,
even if you are unprepared. The core of this course is in what we do together
in class. Missed work can always be made up; a missed class is gone forever.
Excessive absences will result in a significant grade penalty. Let me say that
again, excessive absences will result in a significant grade penalty.
Students will be expected to follow the guidelines explained on the Course
Contract.

  2. Quizzes and Short Assignments: 15%  
Several quizzes (unannounced) will be given during the course of the semester.
The one lowest grade will be dropped. Assignments will include short class
presentations and attendance at one of Georgetown's Friday afternoon concerts.
A review of this concert will be included as part of the reading and listening
journal described below.

  3. Reading and Listening Journal: 25%  
For each reading and some listening assignments, students will write a journal
entry. This journal will be turned in twice  during the semester. See further
instructions.

  4. Exams: 50%  
Two exams will be given during the semester, each counting 25% of the final
grade. Student should expect objective questions as well as essays on the
exams. You should also be able to identify by title, composer, and date
(within five years on either side) any of the pieces you have been assigned.

**Warnings:**

  1. Unfortunately there is no textbook for a course of this type. That means that the music itself will be our principal text. Many students who have not had experience with critical listening forget that listening, like critical reading requires your full attention. You should take notes, re-listen, and discuss the music in the same ways you might take notes, reread, and discuss a reading assignment. In other words, do not assume that you can do the listening on your car CD player, or while cooking dinner. Give yourself plenty of time to do, and think about, each assignment. I advise doing each listening assignment at least twice. Listening cannot be rushed!
  2. Turning in late assignments makes it difficult for me to grade them and is unfair to the other students. The due dates and exam dates listed on this syllabus are not suggestions, but rather requirements. Please come to class on time, ready to turn in assignments at the start of the class period. Extensions will be given only in cases of real emergencies.
  3. Please look carefully at the topics listed on the syllabus.  Some students assume that a class of this type will primarily cover popular music of the last half century (1960s anti-Vietnam songs, hip-hop, etc.).  While these traditions will form an important part of this course, they are by no means the only types of music we cover (nor do they even make of the majority of our topics).  Students should be prepared to listen to, learn, and think about, not only popular songs, but also symphonies and operas.  Students interested only in popular music should not take this course.

_All that said I think anyone taking the class seriously will have a good time
and earn a good grade_.

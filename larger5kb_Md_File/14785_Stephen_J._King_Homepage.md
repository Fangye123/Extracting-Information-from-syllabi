_GOVT 475 The Politics of North Africa_ ([Syllabus](govt475S02.pdf))  
Politics in North Africa seeks to describe and analyze patterns of politics in
contemporary North Africa. Several topics will help us understand politics in
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. A central aim will be to explore the
nature of the Maghribi countries. Other topics that we will cover include
rural development, the relationship between state and society; the role of
organized religious groups in politics; democratization and the multipartyism;
the ways in which government authorities have tried to guide economic life;
and both regional and global economic integration.  
**  
Fall 2001** :  
_GOVT 404_ _Political Economy of Development_ ([Syllabus](govt404.pdf))  
This course will introduce students to major themes and issues subsumed under
the rubric of the political economy of development. It is designed partly to
survey development strategies and various patterns of politics and
stratification that are to some extent shared by Late Developing Countries
(LDCs). This course also exposes students to the main debates in the field of
economic and especially political development and underdevelopment (This is a
course taught by a political scientist). The emphasis is on the kinds of
questions scholars have asked about economic and political development and the
ways that they have answered them. The reading covers many of the classic
texts in the field but also gives students a sense of the frontiers of
research on the political economy of development. Although the emphasis is on
arguments, debates and analytical constructs, students will be exposed to case
material from Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia as it relates
to theories.

_GOVT 418 Political Economy of the Middle East and North Africa_
([Syllabus](govt418.pdf))  
This course explores themes in the literature on development and
underdevelopment. The focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA)
represents an attempt to integregate political economy research on MENA states
into general debates in the political economy of development. The survey of
case materials will be broad, although there will be more of a focus on
Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and Saudi Arabia. Particular attention is paid to
development strategies and links between economic and political organization.  

**  
Spring 2001** :  
_GOVT 475 Politics in North Africa_ ([Syllabus](govt475.pdf))  
Politics in North Africa seeks to describe and analyze patterns of politics in
contemporary North Africa. Several topics will help us understand politics in
Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia and Libya. Major works on each country were chosen
to illustrate different analytical approaches and substantive content:
political culture, corporatism, Islamism, and the rentier state. Two themes
will dominate the second half of the course. First, like other regions in the
world, North Africa faces general economic globalization; we will explore
issues of political economy from an international, regional, and comparative
perspective. Second, the Maghribi countries will be studied in the context of
their prospects for democratization.  

_GOVT 121 Comparative Political Systems_ ([Syllabus](govt121S01.pdf))  
This course will serve as a general introduction to comparative political
analysis. Individual sections will focus on different thematic issues and
regions. ****

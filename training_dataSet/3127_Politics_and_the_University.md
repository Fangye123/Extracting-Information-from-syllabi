The central idea of a liberal arts education is "know thyself," but we seldom
apply this dictum to the university itself. Indeed, considering how much time
we are now spending in a university, it's remarkable how little most of us
(faculty and administrators as well as students) know about the American
system of higher education. The purpose of this course is to develop a
perspective on higher education by comparing the American system to those of
other countries. An underlying assumption is that higher education systems
don't just happen; they are the result of chains of political decisions, so
the very different kinds of postsecondary educational systems found throughout
the world reflect significant political differences in the countries
concerned. Hopefully this perspective will allow us to ask what is good and
bad about our own system and perhaps develop some ideas about how to improve
it.

We will approach the question in several different ways. First, you will be
expected to do the reading on the syllabus before the class. This looks like a
staggering task, but in fact most of the material consists of fairly short
articles to expose you to different points of view fairly quickly. The reading
is central to the course. For each topic I tried to look at some general
arguments, move to some specific examples both in the U.S. and abroad, and
link them up to some current issues or problems at Rutgers. The required books
will be available at the Student Cooperative Bookstore on the Douglass campus.
All other materials will be available both on reserve at Douglass Library and
in a photocopy packet which you may purchase from Pequod Copies on 119
Somerset Street on the College Avenue Campus, next go Legends Bakery and
across from Greasy Tony's. (Pequod was used rather than Kinkos because it was
25% cheaper.) Unfortunately, the copyright rules for photocopying materials
for classroom purposes have been changed this year, and as a result we have
been unable to get permissions to reprint much of the materials in the Pequod
packet. Therefore, please do not go to Pequod. I will let you know when the
packet is available; in the meantime, we will have rely on the reserve
materials.

Second, I do not intend to lecture in class. You are expected to bring ideas
from your reading and elsewhere into the classroom for discussion. I will also
invite one or two visitors from the Rutgers community with specialized
knowledge or background to attend each class. However, they will not be asked
to lecture either; instead they have been asked to participate in a
conversation with the class (not with me). If you do not come to class
prepared to initiate and further this conversation, it will be embarrassing
for all concerned. Normally the conversation with the visitor will last
roughly for the first hour of the class; we will then take a break and return
for the balance of the period.

Third, you will be required to do a major research paper. The topic should be
approved by me by October 9. It will be due into me by November 27. The paper
should be at least twenty double-spaced pages long and have the usual research
apparatus of references, bibliography, etc. It may analyze any aspect of
higher education that you wish, either going into a topic we cover in more
depth or picking another area altogether. However, it must compare the
experiences of at least three countries in a systematic way.

Your grade will be calculated on the following basis:  
Final exam on scheduled date 40%  
Paper 40%  
Class participation 20%

REQUIRED BOOKS (paperbacks, in Douglass Bookstore):  
Burton Clark, Perspectives on Higher Education  
Henry Rosovsky, The University: An Owner's Manual

Comparative Study  
D. Bruce Johnstone, Sharing the Costs of Higher Education  
Arthur Hauptman, The Tuition Dilemma: Assessing New Ways to Pay for College  
William Taylor, Universities Under Scrutiny, OECD

A few copies of all other materials in the syllabus should be on reserve at
the Douglass Library. However, the Library's reserve policy is to put only a
few copies on reserve. Therefore I have arranged for Pequod Copy Studio, 119
Somerset Avenue, New Brunswick (across the street from Greasy Tony's) to sell
all these materials in a packet. (Pequod was chosen because it was
substantially cheaper than Kinkos; I would be interested in any comments on
the quality of their service.) Note that you are not required to buy these
materials. However, whether you buy them or use them on reserve, you are
responsible for having read all assigned materials before the class when they
are assigned. This packet will be expensive; you may want to share one with a
fellow student.

SHORTCUT TO [The Cyberguide to World Music](cybergd.html)  
  

**INTRODUCTION TO WORLD MUSIC**

  
This course provides an introduction to musics of the world. More importantly,
in this course, students will develop ways of approaching all musics, wherever
their origin, through an appreciation of musical expression as human activity.
We will do this by considering numerous case studies of musical expression in
a wide range of contexts, from the deeply spiritual, to the raucously
entertaining. We will examine how context and event impact the music itself,
as well as how music reflects the social and cultural preferences of the
people who make and consume diverse traditions of music.

**Humanities II**  
Spring 2002  
4 Hours; TTH  10:00 A.M.-11:50 A.M.  
CONV 102

We will explore Western civilization from the Protestant  
Reformation to the 20th century.  Any study of the human  
past requires an ordering principle to prevent drowning in  
a sea of disconnected facts.  Our ordering principle is a small  
set of defining characteristics of Western civilization as found within  
the study of seminal texts.  These defining characteristics include  
the growth and questioning of rational thought, constitutional forms  
of polity, and the tensions between religion, politics, and philosophy.

Our goals are to read, understand and analyze some of the greatest  
books ever composed; to investigate the most valued historical and  
philosophical ideas in each time period, and to practice history and
philosophy.  


**Texts**

Voltaire. _Candide_. Trans. R. Fitzgerald.  
Conrad. _Heart of Darkness._  
Perry. _Western Civilization; A Brief History, Vol. 2_

_Philosophical Classics From Plato to Derrida._ Ed. Kaufmann  
Paine.  _Common Sense_

Nietzsche. _On the Advantage and Disadvantage of History for Life_

**Grades**

Midterm: 20%, Final, 20%, Paper 1, 20%, Paper 2, 20%, class preparation  
and active participation, 20%.  The format and nature of the papers will be

discussed in class.  A first draft, worth half the paper's grade, is required

for each of the two papers.

**Policies**

Papers are due at the beginning of class.  Late papers are not accepted;  
you will receive an F for the assignment if you miss the deadline.  
Alternate exam times will be granted only in extreme circumstances.  
You must arrange alternate times in advance.

(NC = _Philosophical Classics From Plato to Derrida_ ; read all introductions

Course description
     Critical thinking about the diverse influences shaping the life
sciences.  Topics include evolution and natural selection; heredity,
development and genetic determinism; biotechnology and reproductive
interventions.  We interpret episodes in science, past and present, in light of
scientists' historical location, economic and political interests, use of
language, and ideas about causality and responsibility.  You address the course
material on a number of levels: as an opportunity to learn the science and
interpretive approaches; as models for your own teaching; and as a basis for
discussions about practices and philosophies of education, construed broadly as
a project of stimulating greater citizen involvement in scientific debates.

Assessment and Requirements
Your grade will be based on the components below, which are described in
more detail in the course packet and weekly handouts.  For each of the two
parts of the grade, completion of "basic work" (= 80% of assignments) gives you
an automatic B+.  To have a chance--but not a guarantee--of getting a higher
grade, "additional work" is taken into account (see course packet for details
and rationale).

Written assignments and presentations, 2/3
A.  Project:  This should concern critical thinking about the influences
shaping some aspect of the life sciences, past or current.  A sequence of 5
assignments (initial description, annotated bibliography, narrative outline,
class presentation, complete draft, and 2000-3000 word final report) is
required.
B.  Journal excerpts (see E. below) (submitted 5 times during weeks 2-12 = 5
assignments).
C.  Clippings packet: A compilation of items from current magazines,
newspapers, and websites (= 1 assignment).
Participation and contribution to the class process, 1/3.
D.  Prepared participation and attendance at class meetings.
E.  Journal with weekly responses/notes on readings, class discussions,
clippings, websites, and study questions.  Collected for perusal mid-semester
& end.
F.  Minimum of two in-office or phone conferences on your project and other
written work.
G.  Optional* End-of-semester Portfolio demonstrating the development of your
work (*for "additional work" grade only).
Texts and Materials
Course reader (xerox packet) in installments from PT.  Get a three ring binder
to hold the packet and other xeroxed handouts.
On reserve in Healey library:
     Folders of additional readings
     Binder of newspaper clippings
     Binder of previous students' assignments
Additional information about classes, assignments, and other tasks will be
provided in regular handouts (which will also be posted on the course
website).
You need a workbook/journal to carry with you at all times and an organized
system to store loose research materials (e.g., a 3 ring workbinder with
dividers and pockets, an accordion file, or file folders).
Additional cases and lesson plans (part of a text in development) will be
linked to the course website.
Recommended texts:
- as a guide to writing and revising: Elbow, P. (1981). Writing with
Power. New York: Oxford Univ. Press (also on reserve). 
- as a guide on technical matters of scholarly writing: Turabian, K. L. (1996).
A Manual For Writers of Term papers, Theses, and Disertations. Chicago:
Univ. of Chicago Press (also in library's reference section).

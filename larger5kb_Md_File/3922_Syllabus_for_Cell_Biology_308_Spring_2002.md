NOTE: This is syllabus is a working document that can and probably will change
as circumstances develop during the semester. This is especially true of the
schedule of activities and tests. It is probably not a good idea to print this
page. It is better to routinely refer to this online syllabus as the semester
proceeds for updates and changes.

#### Catalog Description for Cell Biology 308

308 Cell Biology (3 SH): A study of the cell as a biological unit. Analysis of
ultrastructure, macromolecular organization and function of cell components in
plants and animals is emphasized. Lecture only. Prerequisites: Principles of
Biology 241, 242 and Organic Chemistry 340 or Organic Chemistry 350. Offered
yearly.

#### Course Description for Cell Biology 308

This course is intended to help the student to develop an understanding of the
cell as the basic biological unit. Emphasis is placed on ultrastructure,
organization and function of cellular organelles, and the regulation of
selected cell activities. Many other topics in cell biology will be addressed
in subsequent courses including Genetics, Molecular Biology, Developmental
Biology and Biochemistry. The prerequisites for Cell Biology 308 are
Principles of Biology 241 and 242 and either Organic Chemistry 340 or Organic
Chemistry 350. The course will be taught with the assumption that the student
is fully responsible for the content of these four courses.

#### Instructor's Expectations and Policies

Adequate student preparation for the lecture is expected. Details discussed in
the lectures can not be fully appreciated or remembered if a student has not
first read and studied the appropriate topic in the text. Assessments of
student's preparation for class may be made through the use of unannounced
quizzes. Attendance at lectures is expected. Quizzes may be given and normally
there will be no make-up quizzes or exams. Under truly unusual circumstances
(serious illness or personal emergencies which have been excused by the VP for
Student Affairs or which can be verified by other means), course requirements
may be satisfied in other ways.

To receive credit for this course, students will need to demonstrate mastery
of the course content by earning the appropriate number of points on exams,
quizzes and a term paper as detailed under grading policy

#### Grading Policy for Cell Biology 308

Grades in this class will be determined on a non-competitive basis. It is
possible for every student to earn an "A" grade. The instructor will add the
scores earned on the best four (4) of the five (5) hourly exams (50 x 4 = 200
possible points), the score earned on the comprehensive final exam (100
points), all of the quiz/problem set scores except the lowest score (up to 50
points) and a [term paper](../TermPapr/termpapr.htm) worth a total of 50
points. Grades will be determined by evaluation of the distribution of total
points. Because only the best four of the five hourly exams will be counted
and because the lowest quiz/problem set score is thrown out, there will be no
makeup exams or quizzes in this class. All students must take the
comprehensive final exam to successfully complete this class. There will be no
makeup for the comprehensive final exam. The final exam will be given as
scheduled by official Winona State University policy. The instructor reserves
the right to raise or lower the points earned by any student up to a maximum
of 25 points based on the instructors subjective evaluation of the student's
class participation, attendence, preparation and/or effort.

  * Students earning 90% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "A". 
  * Students earning 80% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "B". 
  * Students earning 70% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "C". 
  * Students earning 60% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "D". 
  * Students earning less than 60% of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "F".

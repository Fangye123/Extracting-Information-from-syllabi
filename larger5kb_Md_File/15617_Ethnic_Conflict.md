Dr. Bernard Cook  
Office: Bobet 427  
Telephone: 2564

Required reading:

Mischa Glenny, The Fall of Yugoslavia: The Third Balkan War. Revised and
updated edition.

Suzanne Goldenberg. Pride of Small Nations: The Caucasus and Post-Soviet
Disorder.

Europa World Yearbook. In the reference section of the library.  For each
country as we discuss it.

Course Requirements:

Punctual daily attendance at class is required.  After the third absence, your
final grade will be lowered for each additional absence. You are expected to
be prepared to discuss the scheduled topic by reading the web site material
and consulting the Europa World Yearbook. Read Glenny for post-Yugoslavia
topics and Goldenberg for the Caucasus.

Paper:

A research paper is due on March 22.

You are to discuss your topic with me by January 22.  You are to bring to my
office a tentative bibliography and plan of attack by February 5\.

The paper must be typed, and neatly done.  I highly recommend that you use a
Mac in the computer lab.  Penciled or penned-in corrections are completely
unacceptable.  I will not accept anything less than a finished product.
Returned papers will be penalized.  Proper academic form must be followed.
Consult the research paper form sheet available in the History Department.
Correct spelling and grammar are expected.  You will be graded on these as
well as content and development.  Papers with misspellings and grammatical
errors, after an appropriate penalty, are subject to return.  The papers are
to be lucid, coherent, well thought-out, and well developed.  Plagiarism will
result in an F for the course.  Any paper shorter than eight full pages,
exclusive of endnotes, will be unacceptable.  No paper, exclusive of endnotes,
may exceed twelve pages. A "research paper" without indication of where
quotes, paraphrasing, or information beyond general knowledge were drawn from
will be assigned an F.

Do not use type smaller or larger than 12 point on a computer or pica on a
typewriter.  Make certain that your ribbon is not excessively worn.  I will
return papers which I deem too light to read.  Do not use margins in excess of
one inch.  Provide a separate cover page with your name and the chapter title.
The papers must be stapled in the top left hand corner.  The deadlines are
absolute.  In order to avoid problems, do not wait until the last minute.

Presentation:

Present a preliminary presentation on your research topic when it appears on
the syllabus or in the "other presentations" category.

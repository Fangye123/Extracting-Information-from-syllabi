> Course Objectives:

>

> Ecological Anthropology is concerned with describing the relationship
between the environment and the development of human culture. It is a highly
complex interaction and we shall approach understanding it from three
perspectives. The first of these is theoretical. We shall explore the history
of anthropological understandings of the relationship between humans and their
environment and current approaches to it. The second is adaptational. We shall
examine the ways in which humans have adapted to a variety of specific
environments. The third is geopolitical. The relationship between humans and
environment has profound implications for current societies. Some of these
will be explored in the final section of the course.

> Course Requirements:

>

> There will be two exams as well as a paper and an outline are required for
this course. The first exam will be in-class multiple choice. The second will
be a take-home consisting of one to three questions and will require a two -
three page typed response.

>

> The third section of this course is a seminar patterned after an academic
conference.   Each student will explore two of the ecological issues in
section three of the class as they affect the ethnic group or nation of their
choice.  Students will designate one of these topics as their "major" and the
other as their "minor."  Students will write a paper on their major topic.
Papers will require library research and are expected to be between five and
ten pages long. Students will write an informal outline on their minor topics.
Students will present their paper and their outline as parts of a seminar
modeled on an academic conference to be held in the last four weeks of the
class.  Papers are due on the day of the class meeting after they are
presented (for example, if you present on a Wednesday, your paper will be due
the following Friday).  Outlines are due at the time of presentation.   In
addition to this, students will have the opportunity to serve as discussants.

>

> Class attendance is required. No attendance will be taken the first week of
class (Jan 14 and 16). Thereafter, you are permitted to have two absences
during the semester. For each absence beyond these two, ten (10) points will
be deducted from your _attendance_ grade. No excused absences are permitted
for _any_ reason. If you attend all the class sessions, I will add 5 points
extra credit to your first exam grade.

>

> Tests, final examination, paper, outline, and attendance will be weighed as
follows to produce the final grade:

>

> First Exam | 25%  
> ---|---  
> Second Exam | 30%  
> Paper | 35%  
> Outline | Must be handed in.  
> Attendance | 10%  
>  
> Final grades may be curved to a normal distribution.

>

> Other Policies

>

> _Late exams and papers_ : Exams and papers are to be handed in by 5 PM on
the day they are due. HOWEVER, you must attend class on the days that tests
are due. If you do not attend class but do hand in a paper by 5 PM, you will
lose ten points on that paper. Late tests and papers will be accepted but will
be penalized ten points for each day they are late.

>

> _Archiving of papers and exams_. Written work in the possession of the
professor two weeks after the final exam date will be destroyed.

>

> _Required official stuff_ : students with special needs (as documented by
the Office of Disability Services) should identify themselves at the beginning
of the term.  The Department of Anthropology is dedicated to providing these
students with necessary academic adjustments and auxiliary aids to facilitate
their participation and performance in the classroom.  This syllabus is
subject to change.

**Office Hours and Consultation  
**  
For brief consultations, please see me just before or right after class. I am
also available for longer meetings during my office hours. E-mail is the least
preferred form of communication and should be used judiciously.  
  
If you have a physical, psychological, medical or learning disability that may
affect your ability to carry out assigned course work, I urge you to contact
the Office of Disability Services at 5453. The Coordinator of Disability
Services, Erin Salva (salvae@kenyon.edu) will review your concerns and
determine, with you, what accommodations are appropriate. After your meeting
with Erin Salva, please see me to discuss accommodations and learning needs.  
  
**I. COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
This course will explore Jewish life and thought in the modern world while
contexualizing this focus in the ancient sources of Judaism. It is assumed
that each of you has something to offer the course and that you are committed
to learning together, developing both as individuals and as a group. The
format of the course will be lecture and discussion with large emphasis placed
on student participation. No class meeting will be devoted entirely to a
lecture and many classes will be spent entirely in discussion. You are
required to bring questions to every class meeting to help prepare you to
participate in discussions.  
  
An excellent guide for background reading in history is Robert Seltzer's
Jewish People, Jewish Thought. For essays on Jewish texts, Barry Holtz's Back
to the Sources is recommended. In the reference section of the library are two
useful tools, The Encyclopedia of Religion (ER) and The Encyclopedia Judaica
(EJ). The contemporary journal, Tikkun, also found in the library, is one you
should peruse. Explore the periodical section of the library for Jewish
Studies journals.  
  
Assignment: During the course of the semester find and evaluate one web site
related to modern Judaism and evaluate one journal.

**Course Requirements and Grading**  
  
A. Regular attendance (one unexcused absence); timely completion of reading
and writing assignments and active participation in class discussions and
group assignments. (25%)  
  
B. Writing Assignments All writing is due on the date announced. Missed due
dates will result in grade penalties unless properly excused. I do not
consider e-mail requests for extensions and no extensions will be given for
items 1 and 2 listed below. Please plan accordingly. Carefully read and follow
my Guidelines, which will be distributed early in the semester, and review the
College rules on Academic Honesty (see pp. 24-27 in the Course of Study).
Please keep copies of all your writing until the end of the semester.  
  
1\. Come to class each meeting with 1-3 written questions or brief
observations on the reading. These will serve as a guide for discussion. They
will occasionally be collected.  
  
2\. There are 5 short writing assignments (response essays) due during weeks
designated in the syllabus. These 1-2 page, single-spaced, typed essays should
be immediate, yet polished, responses to the primary source readings under
discussion on the day you turn your essay in. DO NOT write about Fishbane in
these essays. Please number your essays. (5% each)  
  
3\. One Longer Essay or Book Review (7-8 pages with bibliography) (25%) Note
the schedule of due dates in the syllabus. All submissions should be placed in
the box on my office door. No e-mail submissions, please.  
  
With both options you are expected to explore issues that relate to the
course, but at the same time you should be extending yourself beyond the
assigned material. Books for the review option should be chosen from a list
that I will hand out soon. If you have another title in mind, please see me.

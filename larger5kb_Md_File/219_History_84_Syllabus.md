**Papers:**

The course has two required papers and one movie review. Please take the
requirements seriously. Start early in drafting your papers. Proofread your
paper; do not rely exclusively on computer spell checkers or grammar checkers.

Format: Typed, double-spaced, standard margins, 12 point type.

**Paper #1.** 3-5 pages. Answer the following question using primary and
secondary sources, lectures, videos or other sources:

**How did Christianity simultaneously unify and divide Latin America in the
colonial era (approx. 1500-1820)?**

Tie your answer to your sources. Indicate what those sources are by citing
them, using direct quotation and paraphrase.

**Movie review:** (2 pages) Write a review of one movie dealing with religion
in Latin America. You may choose one that is not on reserve, but you must
clear it in advance with me. In your review, discuss how the religion is
portrayed. How does the movie contribute to your understanding of religion in
Latin America? Is the movie portrayal historically accurate?

**Paper #2.** 5-7 pages. Formulate a question of interest to you for the
history of religion in Latin America and then answer it. You need not go
beyond the materials assigned for the course to complete this requirement.
Your paper can be on any period of Latin American history, but I encourage you
to focus on a topic in the nineteenth or twentieth centuries. Make sure your
paper is based on specific countries or regions in Latin America -- e.g.,
Brazil, Central America.

**N.B. Email me in advance of writing the paper what topic you are going to
discuss.**

Explicitly write the question. Examples might be:

  * Why did Protestantism become important in Latin American in the late twentieth century?

  * Why was liberation theology so important in Latin American history?

  * Why does "popular" or "folk" Catholicism continue to play to be a force in the lives of Latin America's poor?

  * Why were liberals hostile to the Catholic Church? What were the consequences in different Latin American countries?

  * What role has the Catholic Church played in twentieth-century Latin American politics?

CSCI 581 is the course number used for new, one-time, or special purpose
classes which do not have formal course descriptions.  
  
This section of this course does not appear in the published
class/registration newspaper. It has been created and offered because several
CS faculty members have left UM, and their fall classes need to be replaced
with something else. The registration code number is 4102.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Prerequisites:**  
The prerequisite for this course is general expertise in computing and
programming. Everyone who signs up for the course should have substantial
programming expertise and experience.

  * **Graduate student prerequisites:**
    * prior admission to the CS graduate program 
    * eligibility to enroll in 5xx classes 
    * prior completion of csci 211 or equivalent 
    * prior completion of csci 223 or equivalent 
    * prior completion of, or concurrent enrollment in, csci 450 or 503 or equivalent 
  * **Undergraduate student prerequisites:**
    * junior or senior class standing 
    * CS or MIS major (or some related field) 
    * prior completion of csci 211 or equivalent 
If you do not satisfy these prerequisites, then "consent of instructor" will

**Textbook:**  
Deitel, Deitel, and Nieto. _Internet and World Wide Web: How to Program_.
Prentice-Hall, 2000.  
ISBN 0-13-016143-8.  
  
I know that some of you purchased a copy of the book (the first edition)
during the summer, so we will use the FIRST edition of this book during the
fall semester. (The second edition is coming out on August 22, according to
the UM bookstore, but I have asked the UM bookstore to obtain copies of the
FIRST edition only.)  
  
Visit the [Deitel author's web site](http://www.deitel.com) for additional
information about the book. Information relevant to the course may also be
available for downloading locally: see the [download
link](ftp://sbs.cs.olemiss.edu/) at the bottom of these web pages.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Course goals:**  
The purpose of this course is to give each student an opportunity to organize
and extend his or her expertise in web and internet programming, and to
complete a significant internet programming project.  
  

* * *

  
  
**Applicability of CSCI 211 to degree:  
**  
CSCI 211 is the third required course in the B.S. and B.A. computer science
programs. It is also part of any minor in CS. Some other departments also
require or suggest CSCI 211 for their majors. Consult with your advisor if you
have any questions about the role of CSCI 211 in your program of study.

**[Sitting in on the class:](../sitting.html)**  
If you would like to "sit in on the class" without being enrolled in any way,
[click here](../sitting.html) to review my guidelines concerning this
practice.  
  

* * *

  
  
**[Lab facilities and Java software:](../software.html)**  
Students can complete programming exercises using lab facilities located in
the CS department in Kinard Hall. [Click here to go to the online account
application page,](http://www.cherry.cs.olemiss.edu/account/request.jsp) where
you can fill out an online form to obtain your personal logon account for the
Kinard Hall CS labs.  
  
Students who have access to their own PCs can use them for completion of
relevant exercises.  
  
All of the software needed for completion of the programming exercises can be
obtained at little or no cost. See the separate page concerning [Java
software](../software.html) for additional information.

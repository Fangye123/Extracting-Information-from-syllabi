>> This is a "generic" syllabus for this course, which I teach nearly every
semester. Please refer to the particular semester's schedule for the
particulars of that semester. This is a class with a high degree of peer
teaching and interactive learning, so if that is not your cup of tea, please
take a section taught by someone else.

>  We will utilize the UNOmaha CourseInfo system as an integral part of the
course work process in this class. All students are provided with an on campus

>

>> **Required Textbooks: (TBA)**

>>

>> **Also required:  
>  1.** One full-length novel to be chosen in consultation with instructor.  
>  **2.** Another full-length book on a particular tribe of your interest,
chosen in consultation with instructor. A selection will be available in the
bookstore.

>

> **Description of Course:**  
>  This course introduces students to many areas of study within the broad
interdisciplinary field of Native American Studies. Each student will focus on
one particular tribal nation to research in depth. The class will include a
broad survey of Native American history, consideration of current issues in
Indian country, and opportunities to learn about Native America in the Omaha
area. There are no prerequisites. This course can serve as a beginning course
for a minor in the Native American Studies area or can fulfil a distribution
requirement for cultural diversity.

>

> **Attendance policy:** Attendance is mandatory on days with group
presentations or guest speakers. Attendance will be a part of the daily grade
for days with in-class activities, whether announced in advance or not.
Attendance on other days will not be recorded, but you are responsible for
everything covered in class, whether you are present or not. If you have a
legitimate reason for missing class, an email in advance or as soon as
possible following will add considerably to my opinion of you as a responsible
adult.

>

> **" I encourage communication by email and usually will respond within one
day unless I am out of town or ill myself."**

>

> **Course Requirements:**  
>  Your grade will be based on a total of 500 points. I will utilize the
standard scale of 90% = A, 80% = B, etc., but reserve the right to bump the
entire scale downward (for example, 88% might end up = A) if I find that to be
a more appropriate indicator of performance.

>

> **Extra credit** can be gained by attendance at local Native American
events, speak with me about details.  
>

>

> **All assignments and requirements will be explained in detail in individual
handouts, further in this syllabus, and/or in the assignments section of the
courseinfo site.**

>

> **Tests and Exams:**

>

>   * **3 tests,** which will cover specific reading assignments.( topic
identification and short answer.)

>   * **Final exam** , will cover material and readings from the entire
course. (several essay topics and will probably be a take home exam, _provided
students apply themselves to all class work and attendance policy_.)

>

> **Group Project:**

>

>   * Choose an American Indian tribe/nation which still exists today (whether
federally recognised or not) and join with 2 to 3 others who share your
interest.

>   * It will be your responsibility to represent that tribe throughout the
semester, but especially when you give your oral presentation.

>   * Search for resources on the internet which inform about or represent
your tribe. (See further instructions for verifying and documenting internet
research, to be provided.)

>   * Search for resources in the UNO library and from interlibrary loan. Ask
the reference librarian for help.

>   * You must find one book which is completely about your tribe, preferably
coming up to the present day. It does not have to be an enormously long book,
but it must not be a children's book or exclusively a picture book. If you
have trouble, ask me for help.

>   * Choose one person, male or female, whose biography you can research.

>   * Your oral project is to present your tribe, using first person language,
to the rest of the assembled tribes, on the day assigned. (See detailed
suggestions for oral presentation and checklist for evaluation, to be
provided.)

>   * Following the oral presentation, you must turn in

>     * 1\. An annotated bibliography of all sources consulted for the
project.

>     * 2\. A biographical essay of approximately 3 pages on the figure you
chose, whether historical or contemporary. It will be best if you do not all
choose the same figure, but it is not a requirement for all of you to choose
different figures.  

>

> **Book Review:**

>

>   * Choose a full-length novel with a Native American theme and read it.

>   * You should verify the acceptability of your choice with me. You must
choose a novel intended for adults. It must not be a collection of short
stories. It must be by a contemporary writer.

>   * Write a review of the novel in which you address, in particular, the
approach to issues of Native American identity and culture presented by your
novel. See format to be used in assignments section of courseinfo site.

>

>  
>

> **Personal Journal:**

>

>   * You are to keep a personal journal in which you respond to everything
you read for this course. It should include brief responses to periods of web
browsing on behalf of the course also, especially when specifically assigned.

>   * The journal should consist of your personal responses, written in
paragraph form (or whatever other form you choose), after reflection on what
you have read. It will be most productive to write in the journal immediately
after completing your reading assignments. You may make comments, raise
questions, name points which you found interesting or with which you
disagreed, or whatever else you wish to say.

>   * There is no specified length required for each entry.

>   * You may use a notebook, loose-leaf paper, on-line entries which you
later print out, or any other form of recording which you prefer. I will look
at the journals one or more times during the semester and again at the end.
All of the points will be assigned at the end of the semester. The first check
point will merely be to see how you are doing and make comments if you seem to
be missing material.

>

> **" Indians in the News":**

>

>   * You are to watch for stories in the newspaper or magazines which address
contemporary Native American issues. You are encouraged to look at Native
periodicals and newspapers as well as mainstream ones.

>   * You are responsible for bringing in 3 news stories over the course of
the semester. You should photo copy, print out, or cut out (if it is your own
paper) the story and turn it in with your name and section clearly marked.

>   * Each day I will give an opportunity for one or more persons to report
their story to the class. You should make an effort to give at least one of
your stories aloud, but you do not have to give all three, nor will there be
time for everyone to give all three of their stories.

>   * If you happen to choose stories each time which are brought in by
multiple class members and you never get a chance to give one aloud, it will
not be counted against you. If you wait to bring in 3 stories all at the same
time at the very end and there is not time for you to give one aloud, you will
lose some of your points.

>

> **Due Dates**

>

>   * News stories should be spaced out over the semester; more toward the
beginning will be appreciated.

>   * Biography and Bibliography are due within 2 weeks after your group
presents.

>   * Journals will be checked when I have some time, and you will have
several chances to have yours checked but only need to take one of those
opportunities before the end of the semester. You will turn in your journal
with your final exam.

>   * Test dates and exam date given below.

>   * Book review can be turned in at any point in the semester, as long as it
is no later than November 15. I recommend that you be reading your novel as
you have time and that you write the review as soon as you finish.

>   * I am giving a flexible schedule for this assignment so you can balance
it with the date of your group project.

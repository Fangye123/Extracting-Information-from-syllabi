**PLAN OF THE COURSE**

Information networks, or computer networks, are at the convergence of two
important technologies: computing and telecommunications. This convergence has
resulted in local area networks (LANs), metropolitan networks (MANs), wide-
area networks (WANs), and internetworks, e.g., the Internet. Computer networks
were originally research experiments, both the object of study of and a major
means of communication for computer scientists, telecommunication engineers,
and other researchers. These scientific and engineering experiments, however,
have since become immense social experiments as well. The technical and social
character of information networks is the focus of this course, LIS 384.10
Information Networks.

The course is an exercise in neither information technology boosterism nor
technology bashing. Instead, it is an attempt to study computer networks from
a variety of practical and research perspectives reflecting the multi-faceted
nature of the technologies and their integration with social and
organizational practice. There are no formal prerequisites for the course, and
it is assumed that students have no special technical or mathematical skills,
experience, or background with computer networking beyond informed use of the
Internet and Web. Those students with advanced skills and interests are
especially encouraged to assume leadership in the classroom as appropriate and
to go beyond the minimum expectations in the assignments. As with all classes,
your success depends upon what you invest in the course, intellectually,
emotionally, and in terms of your time.

Among the goals for the course are:

  * Providing insight into the historical development of information networks as we now know them

  * Encouraging students to increase their technical understanding of computer networking, no matter what that understanding is at the beginning of the course

  * Allowing students to integrate technical concerns with social and organizational effects and problems

  * Helping students understand the role of networks in current and near-term future professional practice.

Information networks have brought many benefits. At the same time, however,
they have given rise to or exacerbated many problems as well. The semester's
work will allow students, both individually and in concert with others, to
consider these benefits and problems from a multitude of disciplinary and
conceptual perspectives.

As such, the course has three components:

  * Unit 1: **A technical perspective on networked communication** (6 classes), including discussion of the five-layer hybrid reference model of computer networks -- the physical, data link, network, transport, and applications layers. Among the topics will be first- and second-level effects of information networks, the telephone network, bandwidth and data rate, LANs, bridges, routers, and TCP/IP. This unit will also feature two in-class demonstrations by members of the GSLIS IT staff.

  * Unit 2: **Social, organizational, and other perspectives on networked communication** (6 classes)

    * the view from electronic commerce (EC)
    * the view from security and cryptography
    * the view from gender studies and information technology (IT)
    * the view from concerns with the Year 2000 (Y2K) problem
    * the view from scholarly communication
    * the view from the "future of the Internet," i.e., Internet2, the Next Generation Internet (NGI), Very High-Speed Broadband Network Services (vBNS), and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6)

  * Unit 3: **The Greater Austin Area Telecommunications Network (GAATN)** (3 classes), which will include study of the history and current features of GAATN, with student teams investigating individual GAATN principals. While each class session is designed to stand on its own, the integration of all facets of the semester's work is among students' primary responsibilities This responsibility is naturally a part of every class, but it is important that students keep this goal in mind from the very beginning of the semester. The assignments are designed to help accomplish that goal.

In addition to the topics covered explicitly in the semester, information
networks might be examined from a number of other perspectives. Students are
encouraged to consider these topics and perspectives according to their own
interests. Among the major topics NOT explored to any great extent in this
semester's work are:

  * Human-computer interaction (HCI)
  * Community networks
  * The sociology of work
  * The anthropology and ethnography of information systems
  * National and international regulation of telecommunications
  * The National Information Infrastructure (NII) and the Global Information Infrastructure (GII)
  * Digital libraries (DLs)
  * Open versus proprietary systems
  * The implications of computer networks for K-12 education, higher education, and vocational training
  * Information retrieval (IR)
  * Freedom of expression
  * Political organizing
  * Risk management.

As is obvious, information networks can be examined from many points of view,
partly because of the cultural meaning we ascribe to computing and
telecommunications and the central role that they play in politics, social
discourse, and commerce.

The literature on networking is multi-faceted, very large, and continually
increasing; thus, the reading load in this course is both heavy and wide-
ranging. While all students will find topics and readings of particular
interest to them, it is important that students take the initiative to
complete all readings as assigned as well as to go beyond the assigned
readings as their interests and skills dictate.

**EXPECTATIONS OF STUDENT PERFORMANCE**

Students in this class are expected to:

  * Attend all class sessions; if a student misses a class, it is his or her responsibility to arrange with another student to obtain all notes, handouts, and assignment sheets. All assignments, especially the exam, presume that students are familiar with all material discussed in class.

  * Read all material prior to class; students are expected to use the course readings to inform their classroom participation and their writing assignments. Students must learn to integrate what they read with what they say and write. This last imperative is essential to the development of professional expertise.

  * Educate themselves and their peers. Your successful completion of this class and your subsequent careers depend upon your willingness to demonstrate initiative, creativity, and responsibility. Your participation in the professional and personal growth of your colleagues is essential to their success and to your own. Such collegiality is at the heart of professional practice. The group presentation, the annotated list of print and electronic sources, the technical glossary, and the informal discussion questions posed throughout the semester are designed to encourage collaboration.

  * Spend at least 3-4 hours in preparation for each hour of classroom instruction; therefore, **EACH** 3-credit hour class requires 10-12 hours of work outside the classroom.

  * Participate in class discussions and occasional in-class and out-of-class assignments.

  * Hand in all assignments fully and on time -- **LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED** except in the particular circumstances noted below in the list of assignments.

  * Be responsible with collective property, especially books and other material on Reserve as well as GSLIS and other UT Lab resources.

  * Ask for any explanation and help from the instructor or the Teaching Assistants, either in class, during office hours, on the telephone, through email, or in any other appropriate way. Email is especially encouraged for informational questions.

**Academic or scholastic dishonesty, such as plagiarism, cheating, or academic
fraud, will not be tolerated and will incur the most severe penalties,
including failure for the course.** All individual work is assumed to be done
individually and responsibly. If there is any concern about behavior that may
be academically dishonest, please consult the instructor. Students are also
encouraged to refer to the UT _General Information Bulletin,_ Appendix C,
Sections 11-304 and 11-802 and the brochure _Texas is the Best . . .
HONESTLY!_ (1988) by the Cabinet of College Councils and the Office of the
Dean of Students.

**STANDARDS FOR WRITTEN WORK**

**Review the standards for written work both before and after writing; I use
them to help me evaluate your work.**

You will be expected to meet professional standards of maturity, clarity,
grammar, spelling, and organization in your written work for this class, and,
to that end, I offer the following remarks. Every writer is faced with the
problem of not knowing what his or her audience knows about the topic at hand;
therefore, effective communication depends upon maximizing clarity. It is also
important to remember that clarity of ideas, clarity of language, and clarity
of syntax are interrelated and mutually reinforcing. Good writing makes for
good thinking, and vice versa.

**All written work for the class must be done on a word-processor and DOUBLE-
SPACED, with 1" margins all the way around and in either 10 or 12 pt. font.**
If no word processing is available to you at home, please consult with the
staff of the GSLIS Lab on the fourth floor of the S anchez Building. Please
attach an **ADDENDUM** to each written assignment identifying the word
processing package used in its preparation and the hardware environment in
which the package was used (e.g., IBM or IBM-PC clone, MAC or other Apple
product, or mainframe). The goal is to help you develop the habit of archiving
and labelling your work.

Certain assignments will demand the use of notes (either footnotes or
endnotes) and/or references. It is particularly important in a professional
school such as GSLIS that notes and references are impeccably done. I would
recommend the use of APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern
Language Association), or Turabian standards. There are other standard
bibliographic and note formats, for example, in engineering and law, but
social scientists ordinarily use APA. The ADDENDUM stating which word
processor you used should also identify which bibliographic and note standard
you used and which source(s) you consulted to ensure your conformity with that
standard. Familiarity with standard formats is essential for understanding
others' work and for preparing submissions to journals, professional
conferences, and the like. I have placed the sixth and latest edition of
Blanche Ellsworth's English Simplified (1990) on Reserve at PCL; it is an
excellent resource for information on notes, grammar, punctuation, and so
forth. Harry Shaw's Errors in English and How to Correct Them (4th ed., 1993)
is also useful.

Use the spell checker in your word processing package to review your documents
but be aware that spell checking dictionaries: do not include most proper
nouns, including names; omit most technical terms; include very few foreign
words and phrases; and cannot identify the error in using homophones, e.g.,
writing "there" instead of "their," or in mistakenly writing one word for
another, e.g., "the" instead of "them."

It is imperative that you **proofread your work thoroughly and be precise in
editing it.** It is always helpful to have someone else read your writing
carefully, to eliminate errors and to increase clarity. Finally, each
assignment should be handed in with a **TITLE PAGE** containing your full
name, the date, the title of the assignment, and the class number (LIS
384.10). If you have any questions about these standards, I would be pleased
to discuss them with you at any time.

Remember, every assignment, unless otherwise indicated, must include:

  * An Addendum identifying the word processing software and hardware environment that produced the assignment

  * In the Addendum, identification of the note and bibliographic standard used and source(s) consulted for that standard; cite the source(s) using the appropriate citation standard; use only the latest edition of your source

  * Title page with the title of the assignment, your name, the date, and the class number.

**Stylistic and logistical reminders**

Since the production of professional-level written work is one of the aims of
the class, I will read and edit your work as the editor of a professional
journal or the moderator of a technical session at a professional conference
would. The reminders below will help you prepare work appropriate to any
situation. Note the asterisked errors in #'s 3, 4, 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 18, and
26 (some have more than one error):

  1. Staple all papers for this class in the upper left-hand corner. Do not use covers, binders, or other means of keeping the pages together.

  2. Number all pages after the title page. Ordinarily, notes and references do NOT count against page limits.

  3. Use formal, academic prose. Avoid colloquial language, *you know?* It is essential both in graduate work and in professional communication to avoid failures in diction -- be serious and academic when called for, be informal and relaxed when called for, and be everything in between as necessary.

  4. Avoid cliches. They are vague, *fail to "push the envelope," and do not provide "relevant input."* For this course, absolutely avoid words and phrases such as "agenda," "problem with," "deal with," "handle," "window of . . .," "goes into," "broken down into," "viable," "option."

  5. Avoid computer technospeak like "input," "feedback," and "processing information" except when using such terms in specific technical ways.

  6. Do not use the term "relevant" except in its information retrieval sense. Ordinarily, it is a vague and colloquial cliche, but it also has a strict technical meaning in our field.

  7. Do not use "quality" as an adjective; it is vague, cliche, and colloquial. Instead use "high quality," "excellent," "superior," or whatever more formal phrase you deem appropriate.

  8. Study the style convention that you prefer for the proper use of ellipsis*. . . .*

  9. Avoid using the terms "objective" and "subjective" in their evidentiary senses; these terms entail major philosophical, epistemological controversy. Avoid terms such as "facts," "factual," "proven," "proved," and related constructions for similar reasons.

  10. Avoid contractions. *Don't* use them.

  11. Be circumspect in using the word "this," especially in the beginning of a sentence. ***THIS*** is often a problem because the referent is unclear. Pay strict attention to providing clear referents for all pronouns. Ensure that pronouns and their referents agree in number. "Each person went to their home" is a poor construction because "each" is a singular form, as is the noun "person," while "their" is a plural form. Either the referent or the pronoun must change in number.

  12. "If" ordinarily takes the subjunctive mood, e.g., "If he were [not "was"] only taller."

  13. Put "only" in its appropriate place, near the verb if it modifies the verb and near the noun if it modifies the noun. For example, it is appropriate in spoken English to say that "he only goes to Antone's" when you mean "the only place he frequents is Antone's." In written English, however, the sentence should read "he goes only to Antone's."

  14. Do not confuse possessive, plural, or contracted forms, especially of pronouns. *Its* bad.

  15. Do not confuse affect/effect, compliment/complement, or principle/principal. Readers will not *complement* your work or *it's* *principle* *affect* on them.

  16. Avoid misplaced modifiers. It is inappropriate to write the following sentence: As someone interested in the history of Mesoamerica, it was important for me to attend the lecture. The sentence is inappropriate because the phrase "As someone interested in the history of Mesoamerica" is meant to modify the next immediate word, which should then, obviously, be both a person and the subject of the sentence. It should modify the word "I" by preceding it immediately. One good alternative for the sentence is: As someone interested in the history of Mesoamerica, I was especially eager to attend the lecture.

  17. It is imperative in graduate school to avoid careless use of the terms "valid," "parameter," "bias," "reliability," "issue," "significant," and "paradigm," except in limited technical ways. These are important terms and should be used with care and precision.

  18. Remember that the words "data," "media," "criteria," "strata," and "phenomena" are all PLURAL forms. They ***TAKES*** plural verbs. If you use any of these plural forms in a singular construction, e.g., "the data is," you will make the instructor very unhappy :-(.

  19. "Number," "many," and "fewer" are used with plural nouns (a number of horses, many horses, and fewer horses); "amount," "much," and "less" are used with singular nouns (an amount of hydrogen, much hydrogen, and less hydrogen). Another useful way to make this distinction is to recall that "many" is used for countable nouns, while "much" is used for uncountable nouns.

  20. Generally avoid the passive voice.

  21. "Between" is ordinarily used with two alternatives, while "among" is used with three or more.

  22. Generally avoid the use of honorifics such as Mister, Doctor, Ms., and the like when referring to persons in your papers, especially when citing their written work. Use last names, and dates, as appropriate for your note and citation standard.

  23. There is no widely accepted standard for citing electronic resources. If you cite them, give an indication, as specifically as possible, of:

    * responsibility
    * title
    * date
    * place to find the source.

See the _Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association_ (4th
ed., 1994, pp. 218 222) for a discussion of citing electronic material and
useful examples. Also see Gibaldi's _MLA Handbook_ (4th ed., 1995, pp.
151-167, 176-178, 250-252, and 254), although his understanding of electronic
sources, especially in his early chapters, is limited. Unfortunately, both the
APA manual and the MLA handbook cite Li and Crane's flawed _Electronic Style:
A Guide to Citing Electronic Information_ (1993). Li and Crane have written a
second edition with a slightly different title: _Electronic Styles: A Handbook
for Citing Electronic Information_ (1996).

  24. "Cite" is a verb, "citation" is a noun; similarly, "quote" is a verb, "quotation" is a noun. Use "online" (not "on line" or "on-line"), "email" (not "e-mail"), and "Internet" (not "internet") for the TCP/IP network.

  25. Following the advice of Strunk and White, rather than my own poor example, avoid the use of weak qualifiers such as "rather," "very," "little," and "pretty."

  26. *PROFREAD! PROOFREED! PROOOFREAD!*

  27. "As" does **not** mean the same as "because."

  28. Use "about" instead of the tortured locution "as to."

  29. In the context of analysis of social problems, the term "issue" is used in a technical way to identify sources of public controversy or dissensus. Please use the term to refer to topics about which there is substantial public disagreement, not synonymously with general terms such as "area," "topic," or the like.

**GRADING**

The grading system at GSLIS includes the grades of:

A+ Extraordinarily high achievement  
A Superior  
A- Excellent  
B+ Good  
B Satisfactory  
B- Barely satisfactory  
C+ Unsatisfactory  
C Unsatisfactory  
C- Unsatisfactory  
D Unacceptable  
F Unacceptable and failing.

Please see the synopsis, included in the new student orientation packets, of
the memorandum from former Dean Brooke Sheldon dated August 13, 1991, for
explanations of this system. The student is also encouraged to consult the
GSLIS Announcement and the Graduate School Catalogue for more on standards of
work at GSLIS. The University of Texas does not use the +/- grading system
that we do here at GSLIS; UT accepts only full letter grades. Therefore, for
example, final grades of B- and B+ at GSLIS both result in a final grade of B
at the University level.

A grade of B signals acceptable, satisfactory performance in graduate school.
In this class, the grade of A is reserved for students who demonstrate not
only a command of the concepts and techniques discussed but also an ability to
synthesize and integrate them in a professional manner and communicate them
effectively.

The grade of incomplete (X) is reserved for students in extraordinary
circumstances and must be negotiated with the instructor before the end of the
semester. See the Dean's memorandum of August 13, 1991, available from the
main GSLIS office.

I use points to evaluate assignments, not letter grades. Points on any
assignment are determined using an arithmetic, not a proportional, algorithm.
For example, 14/20 points on an assignment does NOT translate to 70% of the
credit, or a D. Instead 14/20 points is roughly equivalent to a B. If any
student's semester point total of 90 or above, then s/he will have earned an A
of some kind. If the semester point total of 80 or above, then s/he will have
earned at least a B of some kind. Whether these are A+, A, A-, B+, B, or B-
depends upon the comparison of point totals for all students. For example, if
a student earns 90 points and the highest point total in that particular class
is 98, the student earns an A-. If, on the other hand, a student earns 90
points and the highest point total in the class is 91, then the student earns
an A. This system will be further explained throughout the semester.

**TEXTS**

There are three required texts for this class and two recommended texts. They
can be purchased at the Coop and other bookstores on Guadalupe, except for the
reading packet available from only University Duplicating Services in the
Graduate School of Business, GSB 3.136 (471-8281).

The **REQUIRED** texts are:

Sproull, Lee,  & Kiesler, Sara. (1991). _Connections: New ways of working in
the networked organization._ Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.

Tanenbaum, Andrew S. (1996). _Computer networks_ (3rd ed.). Upper Saddle, NJ:
Prentice Hall PTR.

A packet of readings.

The **RECOMMENDED** texts are:

Cook, Melissa A. (1996). _Building enterprise information architectures:
Reengineering information systems._ Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall PTR.

Kling, Rob. (Ed.). (1996a). _Computerization and controversy: Value conflicts
and social choices_ (2nd ed). San Diego, CA: Academic Press.

Tanenbaum's _Computer Networks_ is the primary text for the first unit of the
course that focuses on technical characteristics of information networks. It
is a rich but challenging text, and we will move through it quickly. Please be
sure to read the text closely, sometimes more than once. At times Tanenbaum
uses concepts from calculus, modular arithmetic, Boolean algebra, programming
(in C), and graph theory. It is not necessary to be familiar with these areas
to follow his argument, so please read all the assigned parts of the book.
Naturally, the more familiar you are with his methods and telecommunications
and computing generally, the more you will take away from the book. But even
non-experts can profit from it.

Use the index while you read and realize that Tanenbaum often uses terms and
concepts before he defines them. It is essential that, no matter what your
level of technical experience and skill, you play the role of the active
reader. For those of you with technical interests and/or background, be sure
to look at the Problems at the end of each chapter and to go beyond the
sections assigned for class readings. You will find your initiative repaid
many times over.

**Biographical Sketch or Book Review (Due Tuesday, March 23, 1998; 5-6 pp.;
20%)**

For this assignment, students will write a well-integrated essay of 5-6
double-spaced pages about either a person prominent in networking and
information research or about an important book from the two lists below. Only
one student will be able to write about any particular topic, and all choices
must be made through the instructor no later than **WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 10.**
As might be expected, some of the persons in the list below are extremely
well-known and have had much written about them, while others are less well-
known.

Generally speaking, write for the non-specialist with an interest in
information networks, e.g., a classmate with no specialized technical
knowledge. Be sure to explain and clarify all technical concepts, acronyms,
organizations, and so on -- this is an important responsibility of writers and
information professionals addressing technically complex topics.

Whether you choose to write a biographical sketch or a book review, you may
want to look at a few models of each. I expect that the biographical sketches
will meet the standards of the best reference tools, while the reviews will
meet the standards of the best general interest/academic journals.

  * Feel free to refer to any other material with which you are familiar, whether read for this course or not, if you believe that it applies to your review. Be sure to document this other material fully and formally.

  * Put the book in the context of its **importance and/or connection to information networks** and the class as a whole. This section should be the longest part of your paper.

Simple summaries are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this
assignment. Your review must be analytic, evaluative, and, to the extent
appropriate, comparative.

**Group Presentation and Annotated Resource Guide (Various dates; 10% and
25%)**

This assignment will be done by groups of approximately the same size. Each
student will choose to be a member of a group responsible for leading a
discussion about one of six social, organizational, and other perspectives on
networked communication:  March 9| Electronic commerce (EC) -- be sure, **AT A
MINIMUM,** to address the topics of security, privacy, intellectual property
protection, and taxation  
---|---  
March 23| Security and cryptography -- be sure, **AT A MINIMUM,** to address
the topics of public and private key cryptography, privacy, intellectual
property protection, and restrictions on cryptographic exports  
March 30| Gender studies and information technology -- be sure, **AT A
MINIMUM,** to address the topics of feminist perspectives on IT, deskilling in
female-dominated professions, and IT as a means for political organizing  
April 6| Y2K -- be sure, **AT A MINIMUM,** to address the topics of adequacy
of technical fixes, availability of competent personnel, the "global economy,"
and interoperability of systems  
April 13| Scholarly communication -- be sure, **AT A MINIMUM,** to address the
topics of copyright protection, tenure and promotion, versioning, journal
pricing, and archiving  
April 20| Internet2, Next Generation Internet (NGI), Very High-Speed Broadband
Network Services (vBNS), and IPv6 (Internet Protocol Version 6) -- be sure,
**AT A MINIMUM,** to address the topics of what each of these initiatives is,
the general theme of evolution in information systems, public-private
partnerships, and important changes in IP protocols.  
  
The members of the group will conduct the 3-hour class for the particular date
and will be required to provide the following materials. Every student will
contribute to all phases of the assignment:

  * An annotated, critical, evaluative list of both print and electronic resources related to the topic. This list should include at least 25 sources, at least 2/3 of which should be in print. The annotations should be 4-5 sentences in length and should be distributed in print form in class.

  * A Web site that includes introductory material on the topic written by the students and links to appropriate sites. The critical "bibliography" noted above should also be included in this site.

Grades for this assignment will be determined in the following manner:

  1. The instructor will rate the group as a whole for the management of the class; this rating will be worth 10% of your semester grade, and every member of the group will receive the same grade. **Every member of the group must assume roughly the same amount of responsibility in conducting the class.**

  2. The remaining 25% of the semester grade for this assignment will be determined in this way:

    * The instructor will rate the quality of the print and electronic material generated by the students; this evaluation will be worth 15% of the semester grade, and every student in the group will receive the same grade.

    * Members of each group will rate their colleagues' contribution to the group work, and 10% of the semester's grade will be determined by these peer ratings. The form for this evaluation and its use will be discussed as the semester progresses.

In leading the class, the members of the group will define what is meant by
the topic to be discussed, introduce the topic, provide appropriate background
information (including major actors, works, and schools of thought), identify
major conflicts and concerns, and facilitate the discussion of the topic by
all members of the class.

The group should be certain to make clear in their presentation and on their
Web site what each perspective on information networks identifies as
appropriate research methods, research questions, and evidence for
understanding electronic communication.

The first part of the class (roughly from 12:00 N - 1:15 PM) might be used to
introduce the topic and other pertinent information. Handouts, overheads
(whether "stand-alone" or PowerPoint-based), and Web material are important in
that introduction. Presenters should not, however, think that digital bells
and whistles can replace analysis and skill in presentation.

The presenting team should distribute a print copy of an outline of their
presentation and discussion questions, along with a print copy of their
annotated resource list. The second part of the class (roughly from 2:30 -
3:45 PM) should be used for discussion and summary. Group members are to
facilitate, not dominate, the class discussion -- preparing 4-5 discussion
questions and distributing them to the class at least 3 days (72 hours) before
the class is an important strategy for facilitating this discussion.

**CONTRIBUTIONS TO CLASS WEB MATERIAL**

Each student will be expected to contribute to the class Web site. As a matter
of course, students should check the instructor's announcements section of the
Web site at least twice a week. The TAs and I will pose discussion questions,
questions of fact, suggestions for group work and additional readings, and
other material that will complement what we do in class. Students should also
feel free to pose questions to the class as a whole as well as to the
instructor.

More specifically, each student will be asked to make the following
contributions. These contributions will then be made publicly available
through the class and the instructor's Web sites. Each student should decide
if s/her wants his/her identity revealed when the work is attributed:

  1. The Spring 1998 Networks class generated a glossary of about 240 terms important to computer networking and telecommunications. Each student in the Spring 1999 class will add at least TWO (2) terms and definitions (in their own words) to the glossary. These terms and definitions should be sent to the instructor for review before integration into the glossary. If they are not found appropriate, the students will need either to find new terms or modify their definitions as suggested. Do not misappropriate other people's work, but do feel free to consult other textbooks, dictionaries, online glossaries, and so on for ideas and definitions.

  2. The overheads and annotated "bibliographies" from the various perspective presentations and the final reports related to GAATN will all be made available on the Web.

Again, all students must decide individually whether they want they specific
identities revealed for work they did on the Web or if they want a more
general attribution, e.g., Jill Hill, Joe Shmoe, and six students in LIS
384.10.

Please notify the instructor of your preferences for attribution before Spring
Break.

**THE GREATER AUSTIN AREA TELECOMMUNICATIONS NETWORK:  
THE PLAYERS, PROBLEMS, AND POSSIBILITIES **

**Draft due Tuesday April 20 (5 pp.) in class; be prepared for an informal
discussion of initial findings**

**Final version due by 5:00 PM Friday May 7, 1998 (20-25 pp., 30%)**

This assignment will consist of several parts. Generally speaking, GAATN is a
consortial arrangement among seven actors in the Austin area: the Austin
Independent School District (AISD), the city of Austin, Travis County, the
State of Texas through the General Services Commission (GSC), the Lower
Colorado River Authority (LCRA), Austin Community College (ACC), and the
University of Texas at Austin.

Each student will be a member of a self-selected team that will focus on one
of the agencies in the GAATN consortium; interviewing key agency and GAATN
personnel, whether current or past, should be considered for data collection.
Such interviews should, however, be coordinated through the instructor.

Each team will identify these characteristics:

  1. The lead person(s) responsible for GAATN in the agency.
  2. The ways in which GAATN is believed to support the tactical and strategic missions of the agency; material such as strategic plans for the agency and GAATN, as well as Web page material, will be especially valuable.
  3. Problems with the integration of GAATN into the agency's operations, including causes of these problems.
  4. Recommendations for alleviating or eliminating the problems identified in #3; these recommendations should include recommendations for the agency, for the GAATN consortium as a whole, and for any other actors you believe appropriate
  5. Specific technical characteristics of GAATN at the agency's various campuses using the hybrid five-level reference model as the initial means of analysis.

The results of each team's analysis be three-fold, including a report in two
stages:

  * The first stage will be a draft report of at least five (5) double-spaced pages indicating the study team's initial findings about the 5 characteristics of the agency listed above -- this draft should be as specific as possible, otherwise the final version of the paper will suffer.

  * Each team will then informally present their preliminary findings in class so that their colleagues can understand their methods and results -- a major goal here is also for all students in the class to gain more of an integrated overview of problems and potential solutions.

  * The final stage will be a formal report of no less than 20 nor more than 25 (20-25) double-spaced pages specifically addressing the 5 characteristics of GAATN listed above.

Papers will be judged especially on completeness of analysis, specificity of
problem and solution identification, integration of empirical findings with
concerns of the class and appropriate documents, and use of class readings as
appropriate.

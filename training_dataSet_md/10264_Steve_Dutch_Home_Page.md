## My Web Philosophy

  * **It's not so much surfing as Dumpster-Diving.** I used to wonder how bad it could be if we just let anybody publish their ideas. Now I know. _Real_ bad. 
  * **I like computers.** I am awed by them. I am delighted by what they can do. _But I don't trust them!_ Electronic storage is ephemeral and fragile. Not all of that is bad. The useful half-life of most information is a few years. But I do not assume I will always have a Web to access or even floppy disks to read. If I find some useful information, I download it. If it's really important, I may even make a hard copy. If a national emergency breaks down our telecommunications, the Web is history. If a rogue nation or terrorist sets off a nuclear weapon 100 miles above the U.S., most P.C.'s are history (check out something called EMP). I still have a slide rule. 
  * graphics? GRAPHICS? **WE DON' NEED NO STINKING GRAPHICS!** Too many Web pages are cluttered with useless graphics (eye candy). See this campus's web page for a case in point. See how long it takes you to figure out what classes we offer, where, and when. In case you're not aware of it, data storage and transmission capacity are finite resources. Given the spatial nature of geology and some of my avocational interests like geometry and polyhedra, I have a _lot_ of graphics, but I try to keep them to the necessary minimum in number and simplicity. Drawings are mostly 16-color, with no sound or unnecessary animation, to keep download time short and keep material accessible to users with low-end systems. Photos are standard JPEG format, 24-bit color. 
  * **Chunky, not creamy.** I figure if you're looking for information you want to get it, so my pages tend to be on the long side, rather than broken into short segments connected by links. It may take longer to download the page, but once you do, everything is there. 
  * **Links.** I know where my own stuff is. I have enough to do keeping track of my own pages without worrying if somebody else paid his Compuserve bill. I have had enough experiences chasing from one site to another, only to reach a dead end or have a crash, to conclude that links to remote sites are often useless. If I use them, they will go as directly as possible to the item of interest. Unless it's a stable site, like a government agency, I won't link to it. (Even some agency sites have shut down, and sites are being reorganized all the time.) In most cases, if I am aware of sites of interest, I will mention them so you can look them up with a search engine.

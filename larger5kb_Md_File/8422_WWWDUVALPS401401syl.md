**Course Description**

**General**

This course is designed to introduce the graduate student to the principle
method of empirical inquiry in the social sciences - regression analysis. The
overwhelming majority of studies which test hypotheses, empirically fit
models, produce predictions, or estimate policy impacts are based upon some
form of linear least squares analysis. This course will cover the range of
these basic linear models. The level of mathematical treatment is somewhat
more advanced than PS400, but will still be moderate. The course will not
dwell upon derivations. While it is desirable to have had some prior
coursework in regression analysis, this course begins with the basics.

The basic organization of the course is: (1) a general introduction to linear
regression, its use and interpretation, (2) the formal assumptions of the
model and what happens when these assumptions are violated, and (3) selected
special topics of particular interest in modeling policy behavior.

**Course Requirements**

The major course requirements are two in-class open-book examinations and a
seminar paper due the last day of class. Each will count 30%. The paper topic
must be arranged with me, with a preliminary outline/design approved by the
8th week of class. Need I add that it must use regression analysis? In
addition, there will be a few computer assignments. It is expected that the
student is at least moderately familiar with a statistical package such as
NCSS for Windows, SPSS, or SAS, and as such, the teaching of computer skills
is not an objective of this course. The assignments are for illustrative
purposes, and in exchange for not formally grading them, I expect you to
complete them. Thus the remaining 10% will be class participation/ computer
exercises. I would also suggest that each person obtain some data of interest,
including at least one time series of at least 30 observations. This data may
overlap with your paper, and may prove useful during the course.

**Additional Features**

A number of articles and books will be placed on reserve in 316 Woodburn. Most
notable are several other econometrics texts. It has been my experience that
perusing a variety of texts on any one topic has considerable advantages.
Since econometricians are notoriously poor writers, the overlap may well
facilitate understanding where the truth in the equations fails to shine
through. For the sake of brevity, the following is a list of several texts
some with required or recommended readings.

Instructor -- [Kathleen Waln](../../kathys_info.html), Office Rm. 116, ext.

#### _COURSE DESCRIPTION AND OBJECTIVES:_  
Our catalog states this course is a  "survey of dramatic art and production
from the Greeks to 1640. Application of historic principles and styles to
contemporary play production and criticism." (Actually, we will go somewhat
beyond 1640 to include some aspects of Japanese and Chinese theatre.)  
  
We will explore our theatrical history with several objectives in mind. First,
to introduce us to the cultures involved. Next, to expose us to the theatre
practices of these cultures as well as the people behind the theatrical
practices. Lastly, to give us a "taste" of the past and how that theatre
relates to ours today.

#### _COURSE PROCEDURE:_  
We will discover our rich theatrical past in several ways: a) reading your
text and plays; b) lectures; c) small group projects and discussions; d)
writing journals/short papers; e) in class exercises/readings and f) selected
portions of videos.

#### The reading for this class is often the student's greatest challenge. I
have attempted to cull the reading as much as possible to make it manageable
for the busy theatre student. Also, I will assign you to project groups. You
will have a separate handout for this aspect of the class. You will be graded
on the project groups, so it is important to read the materials assigned for
class, bring your books and participate in group work and class discussions.

#### _EXAMS:_  
You will have two exams; a mid-term and a final which will consist of take
home essay questions. I will give you the take home essay questions at least
one week in advance. You will turn in your first essay/exam in the sixth week
of class and the second essay/exam during final's week. ( [to schedule . .
.](th311_sched.html))

#### _PAPERS/PRESENTATIONS:_  
Upper division courses demand a greater academic workload which often
translates into a final term paper. You will all turn in two papers:

#### Library Research  
Group Presentation or Individual Research Paper

#### You will receive a separate handout for these assignments. ([to papers -
presentations. . .](th311_presentations.html))

#### _JOURNALS/PLAY READING_ :  
You will need to keep a _writing journal_ to use at home and in class. I will
give you assignments using the journal at any time, so make it a habit to
bring it along with your lecture notes. The journal can be kept in the same
binder as your lecture notes, however, the pages must be removable so that I
can collect an assignment as needed. You will also receive a separate handout
for this assignment. ([to journals . . .](th311_jrnl_plys.html))

#### _PRODUCTION ATTENDANCE:  
_ You are required to attend two productions this quarter:  
Moliere's _Tartuffe_ \--Cal Poly Pomona, CA  
Shakespeare's _The Winter's Tale --_ LA Women's Shakespeare Co.

#### You will be asked to comment upon these two plays in your journals, as
well as discuss them in class. Group rates/car pooling will be discussed for
the LAWSC production.

#### _GRADING:_  
Grading will be based upon your ability to involve yourself in class
discussions and group projects (this implies attendance), reading the
materials assigned and exams. I will specify criteria as you receive your
projects, journal handouts and exams. If you do not turn in an assignment when
it is due, you will receive a  "0" and it cannot be made up. However, if you
turn something in and receive a poor grade, you may resubmit the assignment
and try for a better grade. Resubmitted journals must be made up within one
week to receive credit. Below is a percentage breakdown for your final grade
in the class:  

#####  Writing Journals

|   **20%**  
---|---  
  
#####  Reading/Discussion

|    **10%**  
  
#####  Exams

|    **40%**  
  
##### Presentations/Papers

|    **20%**  
  
#####  Attendance

|    **10%**  
  
####  
A makeup assignment or exam will only be granted if arranged before you miss
class. _Remember, you are responsible for asking for notes or assignments
given if you miss a class._

#### _PLAGIARISM/ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:_  
I take the issue of plagiarism seriously. You must document your sources
properly, if not, you are stealing someone else's words. The consequences are
serious and ultimately, can result in your expulsion from the University. The
following is from the CPP 2001-2003 Course Catalog. Please refer to page 54
for more specific information:  " All forms of academic dishonesty at Cal Poly
Pomona are a violation of university policy and will be considered a serious
offense. Academic dishonesty includes, but is not limited to: 1) Plagiarism,
2) Cheating During Exams, 3) Use of Unauthorized Study Aids, 4) Falsifying any
University Document."

#### _ATTENDANCE_ :  
As with all classes, it is important that you attend. Need I say more? I do
understand, however, life has a way of getting in the way of our goals. You
are allowed two unexcused absences, but let me know if you can't make it to
class. After a third unexcused absence, your grade will be lowered a full
letter and will continue to lower after each absence. In such a case, I may
ask you to withdraw from the course.

#### Tardiness disrupts the entire class. If you are late four times, it will
be considered as one absence and thus, will lower your grade.

__Oedipus_ Sophocles  
_Medea_ Euripides

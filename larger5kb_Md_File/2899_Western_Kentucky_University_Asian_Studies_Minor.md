**Course Description**

This course examines how culture, economics, and history affect Asian
political development, both in terms of countries and as a geographic region.
The major theme of this course is political legitimacy and its relation to
economic growth, democracy, and culture.

We will examine the structure of power in many Asian societies, dissect it,
and analyze how legitimacy is crafted. When we mention legitimacy, we will
often confront the issue of democracy in Asia. What do we mean by democracy in
Asia? Is democracy or economic development an essential ingredient for state
legitimation? To what extent does the current Asian Economic Crisis undermine
or buttress democratic institutionalization and political stability. Social,
economic, and political changes have accelerated in Asia as the entire region
has become integrated into a global economy. Given the social and political
changes buffeting these nations, is democracy a wave of the future? For some,
the replica of the statue of liberty in Tiananmen Square signifies the power
of democratic ideals, by that implying a democratic destiny for all Asian
nations. For others, the ruthless repression of the Chinese student movement
signifies the intrinsically authoritarian nature of Asian governments. And yet
for others, including some Confucian scholars, democracy is incompatible with
"Asian" traditions and is therefore, undesirable. The fundamental question
remains: How do the enduring effects of Asian culture, historical experiences,
and economic organization affect the design of "Asian democracy?"



**Required Readings**

Readings for this course include four texts and several articles on reserve.
Students must do the readings for each class; reserve material is usually in
high demand, so please plan accordingly. The following are required books, to
be purchased from the bookstore:

Robert Compton (2000) _East Asian Democratization: Impact of Globalization,
Culture, and Economy_. Westport, CT: Praeger.

Orville Schell and David Shambaugh, eds. (1999) _The China Reader: The Reform
Era_. New York, NY: Vintage.

T.J. Pempel (1998) _Regime Shift: Comparative Dynamics of the Japanese
Political Economy_. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press.

Additional readings will be placed on reserve.



**Course Expectations and Requirements**

The course grade is based on the following:

15% Midterm

15% Final

15% First Paper

15% Rewritten Paper

10% Participation and Attendance

20% Two book reviews

10% Paper presentation

The midterm and final exams consists of both essay and short answer questions.
The exams test both concepts and mastery of essential details so that upon
completion of the course, you can discuss intelligently Asian politics.

Writing polished papers is a skill that you will have the opportunity to
develop in this class. You are to write a 12-15 page double spaced research
paper on an instructor approved topic. The paper will be graded for your
research, writing quality, and attention to detail. Remember that the art of
writing requires precision and thoughtfulness. Some say that writing is like
sculpting a statue; details are important. The paper will be turned in shortly
after mid-term for a grade and comments. The paper must be re-written and turn
in with the first paper attached. Failure to make the required changes will
result in a failing grade for both paper. This paper will be presented to
class during the last week. A guide to research papers can be found at my web
site.

Participation and attendance are important. I value highly thoughtful comments
that challenge the instructor and fellow classmates. Discussions about videos
are particularly good opportunities to participate. Each unexcused absence
over one will led to a 5 percent reduction in your final grade (maximum
penalty 25 points).

Students will also be required to write two four to six page book reviews. The
books selected _must_ be approved by the instructor. A sample book review will
be provided.

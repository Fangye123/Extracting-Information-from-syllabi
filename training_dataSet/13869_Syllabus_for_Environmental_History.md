    ENV-280.01							Joseph Siry, Ph.D.
    Fall 1998, T & Th, 2:00 - 3:15  p.m.		 		jsiry@rollins.edu;   646-2648
    
    Is humankind a parasite or a progressive agent of change on this planet? This class is an inquiry into 
    the extent and influence of ecological revolutions in our nation's history. We examine evidence to 
    answer better how humans adapt to climatic changes that alter vegetation and  landscape.  This 
    documentary analysis emphasizes how humans substantially transformed North America's diverse 
    geography over five centuries.
    
    The writers that we read contribute their evidence to the discussion of how well we know the past 
    threats to our ecological life support system,  its biological diversity  and the Earth's fragile human 
    freight.  Together each of you must answer how are the landscapes and resources on which our 
    technology and society depend threatened.

     All assignments are graded with careful attention to each of these criteria:  CLIFS.
    	1. clarity, coherence, spelling, grammar & logical consistency.
    	2. length & development of your arguments, ideas, or presentations.
    	3. information from the class texts, library research, or interviews.

    Etiquette: Class time is spent on comparing oral & written interpretations of the readings. Everyone 
    over the course of the term will be asked to orally interpret the readings and express their writings for 
    the rest of the class in a variety of informal and more structured formats. These activities, including 
    free-writing, group exercises, problem solving, answering questions or leading discussions, are done 
    to increase other participant's comprehension.
    
    
    My Intentions* when teaching and learning in this class
     * Goals of this course, relating to the D and T general education requirements
    
    1. To articulate verbally and reveal repeatedly in your writing the words, ideas, values and beliefs of 
    the authors about the historical process that you are reading. [Three essays to rewrite.]
    
    2. To express verbally  a description of cases and events based on the assigned readings.
    
    3. To read critically and record regularly in your notes the facts and opinions that form the basis of 
    discussions in the class with frequent references to documentary evidence from the texts.
    
    4. To demonstrate how you resolve differences between facts and opinions in terms of tone, rhetoric, 
    degrees of error and false witness, by orally  presenting your written ideas.
    
    5. To display how you organize your thoughts  in a recognizably chronological pattern when 
    describing the significance of documents, persons, places, events or evidence of historic interest.
    
    6. To orally interpret your readings in light of carefully listening to others and contrasting their notes 
    with your notes to more fully comprehend the readings and discussion material.
    
    7. To analyze definitions of key concepts in writing thereby demonstrating both very obvious and 
    more subtle contrasts between competing visions and among the cornerstone ideas of the class.
    
    8. To practice verbally and demonstrate frequently in writing a synthesis of opposing or competing 
    viewpoints as derived from primary and secondary works in the assigned readings.
    
    9. To argue orally based on written evidence from reading, research and listening for the importance of 
    protecting the earth's life support systems, human security and biological diversity.
    
    10. To find, examine, express verbally and reconsider in writing the persistent challenges facing our 
    social institutions, ethical ideals and means of subsistence given the recent decline of wildlife 
    resources, the increase in population and the historically crushing impact of consumption.

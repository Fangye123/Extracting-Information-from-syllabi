Course Description:

This course will introduce students to the major currents of European social,
political, and cultural history from the 18th century to the present. The
course will focus on two principal themes: Revolution, in its various forms,
and Race, Empire, and Ethnicity. Students will be asked to think critically
about what exactly "Western Civilization" represents and how various cultures
have interacted over the previous three centuries.

* * *

Suggested Reading:

Diane Hacker, _Pocket Style Manual_. This is a terrific guide to good writing
and would serve you well throughout your undergraduate career.

* * *

Required Films:

These films are on reserve at the Center for Alternative Media in the Library.
I will arrange a public showing for each film. If you are unable to attend the
showing, you are still responsible for viewing the film before the discussion.
I do not consider these films as merely an addition to the course but as an
important component in learning to work with various forms of historical
media, including film media.

_Jane Eyre_ , 1944, directed by Orson Welles.  
_Lawrence of Arabia_ , 1962, directed by David Lean.  
_East is East_ , 1999, directed by Damien O'Donnel.

**Schedule of Screenings:**

_Jane Eyre_ \-- Wednesday, Jan. 30, 7:00 PM, TORG 2150  
_Lawrence of Arabia_ \-- Wednesday, March 13, 7:00 PM, TORG 2150  
_East is East_ \-- Wednesday, Wednesday, April 10, 7:00 PM, TORG 2150

Course Requirements:

Your grade in the course will be based on:  
1\. Three hour-long exams: 20% each  
2\. Three 500-word reviews, comparing the film and novel assigned for that
segment of the course: 10% each  
3\. Attendance and class participation: 10%

* (The papers must be typed, double-spaced and use 12 point Times Roman font and 1" margins; they must also be submitted in electronic form _and_ in hard copy.)

* * *

Web Page Information:

This course will be utilizing Course Info/Blackboard to supplement in-class
lectures and discussion. Students will also be required to submit their paper
by using the Digital Drop-box function in Blackboard; the electronic papers
will then be made available to the entire class. If you are unfamiliar with
the Blackboard program, I suggest you visit the following site:

<http://www.edtech.vt.edu/blackboard/studenthelp.html>

If you have difficulty logging on, see the following web page:

<http://www.edtech.vt.edu/blackboard/studentportal.html>



The course textbook, _Civilization in the West,_ also has a companion web page
that may prove very useful:

<http://occawlonline.pearsoned.com/bookbind/pubbooks/kishlansky_awl/>

The site includes summaries of the chapters as well as self tests. These self
tests will help you get ready for the exams.



The CD bundled with the new books will also prove helpful. It contains not
only a complete, searchable version of the text, but also self tests and the
student study guide.

* * *

Some Policy Matters:

1\. Completion of all the assignments is required, even if you are taking the
course pass-fail.

2\. You are responsible for the material in lectures, including announced
changes in assignments, films, slides, and discussions. Please do not ask me
for my notes; it would be unfair to the rest of the class if I gave them to
you. If you miss a class, get the notes from another student.

3\. Make-up exams will be scheduled only with an official, documented excuse.
Late papers will be accepted, but students will lose ten points each workday
after the due date.

4\. **_Turn off all cell phones and pagers before you enter the classroom._**

* * *

Honor Code:

Virginia Tech has a stringent undergraduate honor code. The honor pledge
states: "I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this
assignment." If you are not familiar with the honor code system, I strongly
encourage you familiarize yourself with the code immediately; by attending
this university you tacitly agree to be governed by this set of rules. The
honor code constitution is available at the following URL:

<http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/const.html>

The honor code will be strictly enforced in this course. This includes both
exams, the paper, and quizzes. Any infractions will be reported to the Honor
System Review Board and could lead to a failing grade in the course, community
service, probation, or even expulsion from the university.

This page describes the requirements and other details for the Spring 2001
offering of Linguistics 001: Introduction to Linguistics at the University of
Pennsylvania. Specific questions should be directed to Prof. [Gene
Buckley](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~gene). See also [other
courses](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/undergrad/ugrad.html) in linguistics. (The
organization of this course is different from the [Fall
2000](/courses/Fall_2000/ling001/) offering.)

The other basic page for Ling 001 is the [course schedule](schedule.html),
which includes links to the on-line lecture notes and the homework
assignments.

* * *

Ling 001 is a general introduction to the nature, history, and use of human
language, speech, and writing. It is appropriate for any Penn undergraduate
interested in language or its use. Topics include:

  * sounds, forms, and meanings in the world's languages 
  * the biological basis of human language and other animal communication systems 
  * relations of language to cognition, communication, and social organization 
  * spoken versus written language 
  * the reconstruction of linguistic history and relatedness among languages 
  * dialect variation and language standardization 
  * language and personal identity 
  * language learning by children 
  * the neurology of language and language disorders 

The course has no prerequisites, and satisfies the [General
Requirement](http://www.college.upenn.edu/requirements/general.html%0Ageneral_requirement.html)
in Living World (Sector V). Although intended for a general audience, Ling 001
is also recommended as an introduction for students who plan to major in
linguistics.

**Readings**  
---  
  
There are two required texts, both of which were ordered at the [Penn
Bookstore](http://www.bkstore.com/upenn/) (at the corner of 36th and Walnut
Streets).

  * George A. Miller. 1996. _The Science of Words_ , Scientific American Library. W.H. Freeman. (Read [description](http://www.whfreeman.com/generalreaders/book.asp?disc=&id_product=1002002198&compType=BRIEF))
    * also available quickly (and at a 20% discount) from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0716760169/qid%3D980982227/sr%3D1-1/ref%3Dsc_b_1/107-7124123-0676557)  

  * OSU Department of Linguistics. 1998. _Language Files: Materials for the Study of Language and Linguistics (7th edition)_. Ohio State University Press.  (Read [description](http://www.ohiostatepress.org/f98/Linl7x.htm))
    * also available at the Penn Book Center, on 34th Street just north of Walnut.
    * also on reserve at [Rosengarten](http://www.library.upenn.edu/services/reserves/res-vanpelt.html?vanpelt); ask at the desk for "Personal Copy LAN" or "Personal Copy LAM". These are the 7th and 6th editions, respectively; the two books are, as far as I can determine, identical up until chapter 7. 
  
  
**Requirements**  
---  
  
You are expected to do the assigned readings and regularly attend lectures and
recitations, since these are necessary for you to understand the material
tested by written work. There are three kinds of assignments that will be
graded.

**Homework**

> There will be frequent homework assignments (handed out most Wednesdays, due
the following Wednesday in class); they give practice in applying the
principles studied in class and in analyzing particular writing systems. They
are graded on a scale of 0-10. When possible, the corrected assignments will
be returned a day or two later in the recitation section.

>

> Late assignments will be penalized by one point per day late, and will no
longer be accepted once the answer sheet has been distributed. Make-up
assigments will be provided only for students with proof of a medical or
personal emergency.

>

> Your lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester, and
will not figure in the calculation of your final grade. If you skip any
homework, that grade of zero will be dropped.

>

> If you ever miss a class and need to pick up the homework assignment or
other handouts, go to the Linguistics Department office, 619 Williams Hall,
and look in the box marked "Ling 001" on the front counter. In most cases,
however, the materials will be available on the web, from the links on the
[course schedule](schedule.html).

**Midterm**

> A midterm exam on Wednesday, March 7 will test knowledge of basic facts and
concepts covered in the first half of the course (weeks 1-8). It will take the
form of multiple-choice and short-answer questions requiring you to explain or
illustrate a particular concept in linguistics. See the [study
guide](study.html) for topics to be covered.

**Final**

> A comprehensive final exam will cover material from the entire course, with
more emphasis on the second half (since it was not included on the midterm).
It is [tentatively
scheduled](http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/roster/tfinals.html) for Wednesday,
May 9, from 8:30 to 10:30. Like the midterm, it will consist of multiple-
choice and short-answer questions.

In addition, a small portion of the grade is determined by **participation**
in the class, especially as indicated by regular attendance in recitation
sections with an active role in discussions.  
  
**Grading**  
---  
  
The final grade for the course will be determined according to the following
percentages.

> | Homework assignments | 50%  
> ---|---  
> Midterm exam | 15%  
> Final exam | 30%  
> Participation | 5%  
  
Interim grades are circulated by e-mail are various points in the semester.
You can also view information about [grade distributions](grades.html) for the
class overall.

**_Essay Make-Up Exam Policy_**

Please mark your calendar immediately with exam dates so that you know in
advance when your exams are scheduled. If you see a conflict immediately upon
receipt of the syllabus, it is your responsibility to inform the Office of
Student Support of the conflict and to submit a request for a make-up exam
with supporting documentation in order for your request to be considered. All
requests must be make prior to the scheduled exam. Generally, **make-up exams
are essay** in format so it is highly recommended that you arrange to take
your exam at the scheduled time indicated in the syllabus.  
  

**REVIEWS:** ****

Two review lectures will be given. Reviews will be designed to define and
clarify the issues, concepts, and information presented in the aired video
programs and reading assignments. Study sheets for exams will be handed out at
review sessions and are included in the back of the syllabus.  
  

**EXAMS: Two exams will be administered during the course.**

，                                 **The midterm exam will cover segments 1-10.
(Video 1-5)**

，                                 **The final exam will cover segments 11-18.
(Video 6-9)**

，                                 **Exams may include slide identification,
fill in the blank, short answer and multiple choice.**  
  

**HOW TO OBTAIN GRADES:**

Grades will be posted in the Student Support office, SVC 1072, within one week
of the scheduled exam for Tampa students.  Lakeland and Sarasota students
should see Susan Earl or Joan Wright respectively for grades. Grades will
_not_ be given over the telephone.   If you wish to have your grade mailed to
you, please provide the office with a self-addressed stamped envelope and mail
it to: Student Support office, USF, SVC 1072, 4202 E. Fowler Ave., Tampa, FL
33620.  Please include your name, your SSN, and which course(s) you are
enrolled in.  
  

**NOTE:**

Much controversy has been made about the teaching of traditional Western
philosophies and histories during the last 20 years or so. Feminists and other
groups have documented the fallacies and misconceptions of this approach to
history. I urge you to thoroughly enjoy and enrich yourselves with the
information given in this course but at the same time I encourage you to look
and read other histories outside the boundaries of the traditional Western
paradigm.

## METHODOLOGY OF COMMUNICATION RESEARCH I

* * *

### SCOPE OF THE COURSE

  
This course is one of two that is basic to all other graduate courses in the
Department of Communication at the University of Arkansas, and it assumes that
you have already taken an undergraduate research course and have had some
experience writing research papers. The purposes of this course are: to
develop an appropriate research orientation and attitude; to explain the
purposes and problems of various methods of communication research; to provide
an orientation to bibliographic, library, archival, and data base resources;
to survey the methods, procedures, and instruments available for communication
research; to familiarize students with the resources available on this campus
and at other research institutions; to develop skills in reviewing and
evaluating communication research; to help understand the characteristics of
important questions and how to ask them; and to strengthen the organizational,
argumentation, and writing skills necessary for presentation and publication
of communication research.

The primary focus will be on understanding the data collection methods for
legal, historical, and ethnographic research and on discovering the contextual
data necessary for good communication criticism. Neither critical nor
statistical methods of interpretation will be directly addressed in this
particular course--not because they are unimportant but because other courses
in the department focus upon rhetorical criticism, and statistical procedures
are offered in courses in several other departments--although you will find
interpretative schema necessary in writing your paper.

The course will be taught as a seminar. This means that you will be
responsible for your own learning, and I will be responsible for providing
direction and advice. It also means that you should consider our relationship
as one of equal colleagues, not as the traditional teacher-student one that
often prevails in undergraduate classes. I find communication research to be
an exciting process, much like a treasure hunt, and I hope that I can transmit
and you will share my enthusiasm for discovering data and gaining knowledge
about the communication process.

* * *

### REQUIRED READING

  
The reading materials for this course are on reserve in Mullins Library. You
are expected to read all assigned material before each class, become familiar
with the major journals in the field of communication and related disciplines,
and master the stylistic and documentation requirements of the MLA Handbook
for Writers, the American Anthrpological Association Style Guide, the Chicago
Manual of Style, and A Uniform System of Citation (Harvard Blue Book). In
addition, each student will subscribe to at least two listserv lists that deal
with your area of interest in this course.

* * *

### PROFESSIONAL RESPONSIBILITY

  
Any serious graduate student should be a member of at least two professional
organizations, and you should take advantage of the low student rates in
associations such as the International Communication Association, the National
Communication Association, the American Communication Association, Southern
States Communication Association, or related groups such as IABC, PRSA, WIC,
AEJMC, BEA, etc.

Several students have published articles and presented papers from this course
at international, national, and regional conventions, and you should consider
attending and presenting research at these conventions. The Department awards
the J. William Fulbright Student Research Prize in Communication Studies
($100) to students who present convention papers. Also, if your research deals
with free speech questions, it will be considered for the annual Richard
Sheppard Arnold Prize in First Amendment Studies.

* * *

### OFFICE HOURS

  
My office is in 704 Kimpel Hall. I am available for student conferences at
your convenience, by appointment, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, as well
as most evenings and weekends . I check my e-mail (Libertas@comp.uark.edu)
several times each day, and that is usually the best way to schedule
appointments or ask specific questions that need immediate answers. I seldom
do telephone and do not check voice mail.

* * *

### EVALUATION OF PERFORMANCE

  
Students will be expected to read all assigned materials before each class,
make quality contributions to the class discussions, present seminar reports,
critique scholarly articles, review current books and monographs in the field
of communication, prepare a grant or fellowship application, prepare an
annotated bibliography, and write a major original research paper.

Grades will be assigned primarily on the basis of seminar reports (10%), a
research proposal for grant or fellowship funding (30%), and a report of
original research which will be submitted for presentation at a professional
convention or for publication in a professional journal (60%). Grant proposals
that might be funded and papers that might be published will merit a grade of
A. If you receive a lower grade and your grant is funded or your paper
published, I will consider that a successful appeal and will change your
grade.

The general policy for this course is that no late work will be accepted and
that grades of incomplete will not be assigned. Although I am not always an
excellent example, your should learn early that funding agencies and editors
are serious about your meeting their deadlines.

All students should be familiar with the provisions of and expect to comply
with the academic ethics and honesty policies of Fulbright College and the
University as found in the current catalog.

* * *

### THE RESEARCH PAPER

should pose important research questions, present original research, offer
communication implications argued from solid data, be 4000-6000 words in
length (16-24 double-spaced pages of text), and be written according to the
stylistic and documentation standards of a standard guide (e.g. Chicago Manual
of Style, AAA, MLA, etc.). It is not just busy work. It should help you
develop original research skills and should illuminate both the specific
communication topic and communication in a larger context. Mere description
will get you a C at best; description and analysis will merit a B; and an A
paper will achieve some fairly sophisticated synthesis of data, analysis, and
argument about its implications.

General organization should be: (1) an introduction that frames the study,
states the specific research question(s), and explains why it is important;
(2) a review of the relevant literature on the topic or general subject that
puts your study in context of previous research and leads to your research
question(s); (3) an explanation of the methodology and procedures you employed
to collect the data, in enough detail to allow replication; (4) a narrative of
the results of your research; and (5) a discussion and argument about what it
all means--both what the reader should learn and what further research needs
to be done.

* * *

### INCLEMENT WEATHER POLICY.

  
The University requires that my syllabus have a statement about my inclimate
weather policy. If you think attempting to get to campus might cause any
damage to your vehicle or that you might injure yourself, do not come. We'll
work out a sensible way for you to make-up whatever you missed.

### Preparing an Annotated Bibliography

The assignment for this week is to prepare an annotated bibliography of all
relevant materials, both primary and secondary sources, for your research
project. This will give me an idea of how serious you are about research, and
it will be helpful to you in understanding the importance of the sources and
working toward the review of literature section of your paper. The links below
should answer most of your questions about preparing the annotated
bibliography. You may use either Chicago, Turabian, or AAA style guides for
this exercise; it might be helpful in your thinking to consider the style
required by the specific journal to which you plan to submit your research
paper.

### Historical Methods

Historical research offers perspectives on events, people, and phenomena that
are unavailable by any other methodological means. It can reflect the cultural
circumstances and ideological assumptions that underlie events and the roles
played by key actors, as well as an understanding of the long-term cultural,
economic, social, and political forces in play. Such rich insights often are
accompanied by limitations such a lack of quantitative measurement and
precision; however, the careful execution of historical methods can overcome
some of these limitations. A seven-step methodology is usually followed: begin
with clear questions, specify the parameters, gather evidence, evaluate the
evidence, determine patterns, tell the story, and write the paper.

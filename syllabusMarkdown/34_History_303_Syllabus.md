COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
This course is designed to develop a student's ability to research and write
an historical paper. Emphasis will be upon formulating a research topic,
learning library research skills, and practicing historical and
historiographical analysis, thesis formation, writing and organization, and
editing and revising. Members of the seminar will together, and in individual
research papers, examine the personal experiences of Americans who lived
through the Civil War. There will be no final examination.

COURSE OBJECTIVES:  
Students will--

  1. learn how to conduct library research. 
  2. practice the skills needed to write an historical research paper. 

The paper will be approximately 10 typed pages in length, excluding notes,
make a clearly stated argument, establish an historical and historiographical
context, grapple with issues of significance to professional historians, and
use both primary and secondary sources to support its analysis.

  3. become familiar with some of the major developments and trends in the history of the American Civil War. 
  4. learn more about the responsibilities of membership in a community of student researchers/writers. 

REQUIRED READING:

The following books have been ordered by the bookstore:

  * Anthony Brundage, _Going to the Sources, A Guide to Historical Research and Writing_
  * Divided Houses, Gender and the Civil War_, ed. Catherine Clinton and Nina Silber 
  * William Strunk Jr. and E. B. White, The Elements of Style 

REQUIREMENTS:

Your responsibilities as a seminar member include the following--

  1. Attendance and Class Participation 

Students are expected and required to attend and participate in **all class
meetings**. Participation includes informed and appropriate contributions to
class discussions, informal written assignments called reading notes designed
to facilitate such discussion, oral presentations, and other assignments which
contribute to the success of the seminar .

Prepare for all class meetings by reading the assigned material **before**
coming to class and taking notes which both summarize and analyze the readings
and which respond to specific questions which will be distributed in class.
These [reading notes](reading_notes.html) will be turned in at the beginning
of class on the day a specific assignment is to be discussed. **They will not
be accepted at any other time**. Students should plan to print a second copy
of their reading notes (or photocopy them) before coming to class. This will
enable you to refer to your notes during the class discussion that day.

Please note that, because of the nature of a seminar course, students who
arrive late will not be allowed to attend class that day. Should an absolute
emergency arise, one exception to this rule may be granted per student for the
entire quarter.

  2. Research Project (See Assignment Sheets.)
    * [Topic](topics.html)\--must be discussed with, and approved by, me in office hours by Tuesday, Week 3. Please allow sufficient time--i.e. 10 to 15 minutes on perhaps more than one occasion--to talk about your ideas for the research paper. 
    * [Research Proposal](research_proposal.html)\--due in class on Thursday, Week 4. 
    * [Introduction](introduction.html)\--due in class on Tuesday, Week 8.

    * Draft--due in class on Tuesday, Week 10. 
    * [Research Paper](research_paper.html)\--due on Tuesday, Finals Week. 

NOTE--All assignments are due on the dates listed on this syllabus. There will
be no extensions for reading notes and oral presentations. If you are unable
to submit formal written work when due, you may have only one more week to
submit it, and you will lose five points each day that it is late. **Research

### Course Descriptions 2002-2003

WESTERN CIVILIZATION I (REQUIRED)  
This is the first in a three-year required sequence offered by the Department
of History. The purpose of the ninth-grade course is to survey the development
of Western culture from its roots in the ancient Near East through late
medieval Europe. Special emphasis is given to the contributions of the ancient
Hebrews, Hellenic thought and institutions, and the Roman State. Although the
Western heritage will be the focus of the course, comparisons with
contemporaneous Asian developments will be introduced when appropriate. Along
the way, and by means of a variety of written and visual sources, students
will come to an understanding of the nature and variety of historical evidence
as well as to an appreciation of the importance of economic, social, and
cultural factors in studying the past. General evaluation is based on regular
quizzes, quality of participation in class discussions, and tests that include
both objective and essay questions. In addition, a short paper is required
which serves to introduce the student to the mechanics of historical inquiry.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

WESTERN CIVILIZATION II (REQUIRED)  
The second in the Department's sequence of required courses surveys the
development of Europe from the Renaissance through the Cold War. Students
build on the skills acquired in Western Civilization I as they begin to work
with the wider range of sources available for the study of early modern and
modern times. Balanced attention will be given to institutional history,
economic developments, social and political matters, and cultural affairs.
Students use a common textbook, but the supplementary materials are chosen to
reflect the particular interests and emphases of the instructor. During the
year, each student is required to complete a term paper assignment that
stresses the fundamental skills of historical research and scrupulous
documentation. General evaluation is done through quizzes, essay and objective
tests, outside papers, and oral presentations. Students who achieve high
honors in this course should plan to take the Advanced Placement examination
in European history, a test given in the spring. The department holds review
sessions for the students planning to take the exam. Successful completion of
this exam may earn college credit.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

AMERICAN CIVILIZATION (REQUIRED)  
The last in the Department's required sequence, this course analyzes the
national experience from its roots in colonial times to the present. More than
a political survey, the course considers American values, intellectual life,
and other aspects of American culture. The materials used in this inquiry
include American drama, fiction, and biographies as well as a unifying text. A
term paper requiring the use of primary sources is an essential part of the
year plan. Appropriate secondary sources are integrated throughout the
syllabus. Evaluation is done through quizzes, essay tests, outside writing
assignments, and oral presentations. Students who achieve high honors in this
course should plan to take the Advanced Placement examination in American
history, a test given in the spring. Successful completion of this exam may
earn college credit.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

HISTORY ELECTIVES

UNITED STATES HISTORY (ADVANCED PLACEMENT)  
This is equivalent to a college-level U.S. history survey course. Students are
required to master a large amount of factual material and to develop the
critical thinking skills necessary for sophisticated understanding of primary
sources and conflicting interpretations. There will be extensive reading
throughout the year. Students are expected to take the Advanced Placement exam
in May. Selection to AP U.S. History will be based on the following criteria:

  1. The recommendation of the sophomore history teacher
  2. The student's grades
  3. A one-page statement explaining why the student believes this AP course to be the right course for him
  4. One or two additional writing samples
  5. Significant summer reading, which will be tested at the end of the summer. 

(Year Course - 1 credit)

AMERICAN GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS (ADVANCED PLACEMENT)  
The AP Course in Government and Politics will give students an analytical
perspective on government and politics in the United States. Academically, the
course is equivalent to a college-level introduction to American Government.
The first part of the course covers the philosophical underpinnings of the
Declaration of Independence, Constitution, and Bill of Rights. This is
followed by a thorough study of those documents and the people who shaped
them. Students will become familiar with the variety of theoretical
perspectives that contributed to the framework of our government. Once the
structure of our government has been investigated, the course embarks on a
year-long analysis of how our federal system has adhered to or strayed from
its foundation. Along the way, we will also examine the American political
system - including parties, campaigns and elections, interest groups,
congress, the presidency, the judiciary, the bureaucracy, and the overall
policy-making process. AP American government students will be expected to be
able to analyze, interpret and critique historical and contemporary documents
and political writings. They will be required to write effective analytical
essays of various lengths on a variety of topics (e.g. civil rights and
responsibility), using scholarly sources as well as periodicals and
newspapers. In addition to papers and exams, students will be expected to
complete a field research report and take the AP exam in May. The course is
open to seniors only.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

PSYCHOLOGY (ADVANCED PLACEMENT)  
This course is intended to introduce the student to the history, principles,
and applications of psychology. The course will focus on psychology as a
science, including experimental method, perception, and learning, followed by
a concentration on child development and theories of personality. The final
portion of the course will be devoted to the study of personality disturbances
and their treatment. Evaluation is based on tests, experiments, and papers. At
the conclusion of the course, students will be expected to take the Advanced
Placement exam. The course is open to seniors only.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

ECONOMICS (ADVANCED PLACEMENT)  
Economics is the study of choices that individuals, firms, and societies must
make as they use scarce resources to provide for material well being. Economic
principles and the theoretical tools of both micro- and macroeconomics are
studied. Topics include the role of markets for products and inputs (labor and
capital), production theory, industrial structure, environmental issues,
income inequality and poverty, inflation, unemployment, economic growth, the
financial system, fiscal and monetary policy, and international trade and
currency issues. This college-level course prepares students for two Advanced
Placement examinations (Microeconomics and Macro-economics). Students are
asked to master introductory economic theory, take part in debates, write
position papers, and analyze the issues with some degree of sophistication.
Students may also participate in the Fed Challenge competition sponsored by
the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. The course is open to seniors only.  
(Year Course - 1 credit)

HISTORY OF CHINA  
Among the nations of East Asia, China occupies a unique position: The longest
continuously existing civilization on earth, its size and cultural fecundity
made it a powerhouse of influence on its neighbors and a fascinating object of
study in its own right. This year-long senior elective will survey the history
of China, concentrating on the pre-modern era (sometimes called Traditional
China) when the shaping institutions and philosophies of the "Middle Kingdom"
took form. Special attention will be devoted to the visual arts. In the latter
half of the second semester, the course will explore China's encounter with a
resurgent West, the decay of the dynastic system, and the tumultuous and
agonizing recent history of a China whose regnant philosophy became a species
of Western materialism.  
(Year course - 1 credit)

ADVANCED TOPICS IN U.S. SOCIAL HISTORY  
This course explores the unique social, political, economic, and human
transformations wrought by popular culture in contemporary America. We will
examine the impact of mass media-motion pictures, television, radio-from John
Wayne to MTV. Topics will include, of course, "Elvis Presley and the Civil
Rights Movement," "You'll never work in this town again: The Hollywood Ten,"
the original _Planet of the Apes_ , "Muhammad Ali and the Vietnam War,"
"Ronald Reagan: The Screen Actor's Guild in the White House," "Disco is The
Culture of Narcissism?" Elia Kazan's _A Face in the Crowd_ vs. Sidney Lumet's
_Network_ vs. Spike Lee's _Bamboozled_ , "Sinatra in Las Vegas/Kennedy in
Camelot," and "The House of Hip-Hop." Class meetings will involve lecture and
discussion. Student work will include quizzes of cultural literacy and
directed research projects.  
(Year course - 1 credit)

ETHICS AND RELIGIONS:  
A STUDY OF CURRENT MORAL DILEMMAS AND THE WORLD'S RELIGIONS  
Abortion, capital punishment, doctor-assisted suicide, environmental ethics,
famine relief, human cloning, social responsibility of corporations,
terrorism, and war: These are some of the issues we will discuss in the first
part of this course. For each issue, students will be exposed to the clashing
views of the opposing sides, and students will figure out what their own views
are.  
In the second part of the course, we will switch from applied ethics to
theoretical ethics. The questions we will discuss include: Do the ends justify
the means? What makes an action right or wrong? Are there moral absolutes, or
is morality relative to each culture, or to each individual? Why should a
person act morally at all? Our text will be _Ethics: Discovering Right and
Wrong_ , by Louis Pojman.  
In the third part of the course, students will be introduced to the major
religious traditions of the world. Specifically, we will study Hinduism,
Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Our text
will be _The World's Religions_ , by Huston Smith; we will also read primary
sources - ancient and modern - from each religion.  
After students have deepened their knowledge of the diverse religions
practiced by people throughout the world, we will end the course by discussing
some of the interesting questions central to the academic study of religion:
What does it mean for a person to be religious? What is the essence of
religion? Is there a common core to all religions or not? What role does
religion play in our world today? What is the future of religion?  
Overall, this course will introduce students to two very important academic
fields: philosophical ethics and religious studies. Students will be
encouraged to think for themselves and develop their ideas fully. They will
also be exposed to views that contradict their own, and this will, hopefully,
build their tolerance of diversity and ambiguity. Finally, through active and
thoughtful participation during our discussions, students will develop their
ability to express themselves and to listen well to others. This course will
be open to both juniors and seniors.

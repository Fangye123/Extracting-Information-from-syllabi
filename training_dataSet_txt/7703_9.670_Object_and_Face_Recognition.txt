Lecture Details
Location: E25-202
Times: Tuesdays and Thursdays 1-2:30
Description
Provides a comprehensive introduction to key issues and findings in object recognition in experimental, neural, computational, and
applied domains. Emphasizes the problem of representation, exploring the issue of how 3-D objects should be encoded so as to
efficiently recognize them from 2-D images. Second half focuses on face recognition, an ecologically important instance of the general
object recognition problem. Describes experimental studies of human face recognition performance and recent attempts to mimic this
ability in artificial computational systems. An additional project is required for graduate credit.

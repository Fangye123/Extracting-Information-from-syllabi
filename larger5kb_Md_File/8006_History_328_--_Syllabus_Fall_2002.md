**COURSE EVALUATION:**

I. Each student in the course will be expected to complete two tests which
will examine knowledge of the specific ingredients of the course. (Dates TBA)

II. Each students will be expected to complete three short (5-6 pages)
carefully researched and written essays which will approach (1) historic
methodology, (2) interpretation of controversial evidence, and (3) reliability
of primary evidence. Listed below are the assigned questions. Any student who
would like to substitute a question of similar type may propose said question
to the course instructor.

Essay no. 1 - The chronology of the Aegean Bronze Age is ultimately based on
the chronology of ancient Egypt. Investigate the process by which the Aegean
chronology was created and the ramifications of said process. (Date due TBA)

Essay no. 2 - The 1967 discovery of the bronze age town of Acrotiri on the
island of Santorini has sent scholarly shock-waves throughout the world of
Aegean and Near Eastern Bronze age scholarship. Investigate the nature of the
controversies which have arisen from Acrotiri, summarize the major established
but conflicting scholarly opinions concerning the controversies, and, based on
your evidence, suggest your own opinion. (Date due TBA)

Essay no. 3 - The originally oral tradition of Homer's epic _Iliad_ and
_Odyssey_ has preserved for us the primary pieces of evidence by which the
Greeks of the classical period remembered their ancient past. Investigate the
nature of oral history and analyze the process which historians must use to
evaluate such oral evidence. Based on your analysis, write about whether or
not an Ur text of Homer is possible and, if so, the realability of this Ur
text as a historic document. Finally, draw your own conclusions about the
nature of ancient Greeks' knowledge of their own history. (Date due TBA)

III. Each student will be expected to complete a general essay final
examination on the content of the class. (See final exam schedule)

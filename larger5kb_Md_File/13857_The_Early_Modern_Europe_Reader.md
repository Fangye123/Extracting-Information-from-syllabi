A _primary text_ is a document that was written during the period of history
which you are studying. Reading what people wrote in the past gives us a
window into what they thought and did. The texts correspond with the topics on
the syllabus (below).

When you read a primary text, try not to be confused or put off by the fact
that the writing may not sound like normal everyday English. Look for the
author's point of view and opinions and try to apply what you know about the
historical period to what you read in the document.

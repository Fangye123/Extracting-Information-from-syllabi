   American Political & Diplomatic History 1       American Political & Diplomatic History Part 1: The Age ofNationalism Honors Seminar **Note: This syllabus is still underconstruction. It may be altered. History 133Swarthmore CollegeProf. Bruce DorseyFall 1999 This seminar will explore majorthemes and topics in the political and diplomatic history of theUnited States from the American Revolution to the Philippine-AmericanWar ending in 1902. One might say the narrative we're exploring thissemester concentrates on how a nation emerged out of the grips of oneempire only to become an empire itself. The meanings of nationalismin American life, the historical impulses toward empire, and thesocial and political conflicts that defined nineteenth-centuryAmerican life and culture will be central themes in thiscourse. REQUIRED READINGS:  Thomas G. Patterson,   American Foreign Relations: A History, v. 1 To   1920. Thomas G. Patterson, Major   Problems in American Foreign Relations , v. 1. Gordon S. Wood, The   Creation of the American Republic, 1776-1787. David Waldstreicher, In   the Midst of Perpetual Fetes. Thomas R. Hietala,   Manifest Design. Tyler G. Anbinder,   Nativism &.Slavery. Jean H. Baker, Affairs of   Party The Political Culture of Northern Democrats. Eric Foner, A Short   History of Reconstruction. Robert McMath, American   Populism. Rebecca B. Edwards, Angels   in the Machinery. Walter LaFeber, New Empire   An Interpretation of American Expansion,   1860-1898.  COURSE REQUIREMENTS: It goes without saying that everystudent in the seminar will attend and participate actively in theseminar (Oh, sorry, but I just said that.) ReadingAssignments: Students are expected to purchaseand read the required readings for each week, complete the minimumreading assignment, and in most cases read all (or nearly all) of theadditional reading. Students will also be expected to becomeacquainted with the material for each week's topics for seminarpapers. If we are not prepared to discuss these topics, thenadditional written assignments will have to be added to the seminarrequirements. WrittenAssignments: You will write at leastfour papers for this seminar. Papers should be about 4-5(single spaced) pages (1,200-2,000 words) in length. The quality ofyour work, not the size of your paper, is our primary concern. A listof topics and readings is included within each week of thesyllabus. Seminar papers should be able tocritically analyze the arguments of historians, and concisely andconvincingly present your own assessment of an important theme ortopic in American political or diplomatic history. A good seminarpaper will bring the other members of the seminar immediately intothe heart of your argument, without excessive narrative ordescription. It will also present the most convincing evidence youcan find to substantiate your interpretation. Seminar papers mustinclude a bibliography of sources used. Seminar papers are due on theclass server no later than 24 hours before the seminar meets. Everymember of the seminar will be responsible for reading each other'spapers carefully prior to the seminar and offering comments on thepapers as a part of the seminar session. DiscussionLeadership: At least one student each weekwill be responsible for being the seminar discussion leader. Thediscussion leader will be responsible for having read book reviews ofthe major readings for each seminar paper, and for preparingdiscussion questions that both facilitate discussion for the seminarand also ask the authors of papers to relate their conclusions to thegeneral readings that week. A good discussion leader will try to keepthe discussion focused on a particular historical problem, and willbe often asked to summarize the seminar discussion at the end of theclass. Examination: All students will take a finalexamination.

### Course Description

The object of this course is to assess the challenges and opportunities in
working on projects which reach or involve people other than trained
historians in the creation of our collective history. How do we find the
information that no one chose to write down or thought important enough to
remember? How do we ask questions of informants that will elicit meaningful
answers? How can the historian play a constructive role in educating the
public about aspects of the past that continue to affect our individual or our
collective identities? How can we be sure that we are being "true" to the
past?

We will spend the first three weeks reading and discussing some of the
literature that deals with conceptual issues, methodologies, and resources for
carrying out research projects in public history. I make the assumption that
many of you will work on local history topics; in the process, you will need
to think creatively about the use of diverse materials to use in your
research. These readings will introduce you to possibilities, and will start
you thinking about interesting ways to combine research materials.

Your major goal in this course is to learn how to combine a variety of
unpublished sources in order to shed light on a topic that has not been
thoroughly documented. The major written products for this course will include
(a) a _research_ paper of about 20-25 pages (double-spaced) with footnotes (or
endnotes) and a full bibliography, and (b) the development of a prospectus of
about 3-5 pages that suggests how your research might be used in a public
context. When I evaluate your research paper, I will be looking at the clarity
of the argument, the substantive analysis, the quality of writing, and the
extent of the research. The prospectus will follow the model of a small grant
proposal, in which you specify the need for this study, the intended audience,
the way the information will be disseminated, and the projected costs for
implementing the design. You will need to submit a draft of each (paper and
prospectus) about a month before the products are due.

Discussion is a critical part of this course. I expect you to come to class
well prepared to exchange ideas about the readings you are doing. You will
need to think about major themes and issues in these readings and how they
might affect your particular project. Each week, one or more students will be
assigned the role of discussion leader. At the end of the course, we will be
discussing one another's papers, offering constructive criticisms, and you
will be evaluated on your commitment and ability to offer productive feedback
to your classmates.

Every student should have a contact beyond this class who represents the
"public" in some sense. This person will serve as your "client" for the
purposes of this project, and will help you to identify possible public
outcomes for your work. This person can also help you identify sources and
materials to explore. I will serve initially as the liaison between you and
this "client."

### Possible Topics for HIUS 401: Topics in Public History

The following topics are suggestions:

  * **Exhibiting Roadside America --** tied in with the current exhibit by David Plowden at the Bayly; work with local artist, David Rose, who is very interested in developing an exhibit to go along with his artistic models of old gas stations across America. This is an opportunity to work on a broad topic and to think about ways to use your research for potentially major exhibits that would travel to cities across America. 
  * **The Year the Governor Closed the Schools --** 40 Years of Desegregation -- The Albemarle County Historical Society will be sponsoring an exhibit on this issue which relates to Charlottesville's and Virginia's specific responses to the Brown vs. Board of Education court case. Opportunities to work with local residents through oral interviews, and to work with the ACHS in planning an exhibit that will take place this year. 
  * **William Faulkner and his years at UVA --** This is the centenary of Faulkner's birth, and UVA will have a number of events surrounding it, including talks by faculty, some connection with the film festival, a birthday party, etc. Special Collections has the largest Faulkner collection in the country as well. One possibility is to explore Faulkner's connections with the university, by reading his correspondence with his editor, agent, and with the English Department while he was in residence. There are also a set of tapes from his lectures. Anther resource would be to contact alumni who knew him to get peoples' impressions. 
  * **UVA's 20th Century History --** There are several topics that are currently being studied, and much remains to be done. The archives are rich with administrative detail, but working directly with alumni, current administrators, and faculty will yield a different kind of information. Topics underway include: 

> Student Leadership at UVA: a 50 year retrospective  
> UVA Alumnae from 1920-1970  
> The African-American community: its early years

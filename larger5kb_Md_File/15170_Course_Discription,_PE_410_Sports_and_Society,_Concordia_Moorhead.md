**Integration Requirement:**  
**As an integration course at Concordia, PE-410 students will be expected to
bring a variety of disciplines to the task of examining modern sport as it is
practiced and organized in the U.S. and internationally. Although thetext is
written primarily from a sociological and physical** **education perspective,
students will be expected to call upon such** **fields as economics,
physiology, psychology, the humanities, journalism,** **education, biology and
law in working through the issues addressed in the class.**

##  Informed Lively Discussion:

**The success of a student's participation in this class will be greatly
affected by her or his willingness to bring informed and thoughtful input to
the class discussions. That will require both preparation and a willingness to
engage in lively discussion onmultifaceted issues that can often stir strong
emotions, as well as honest intellectual differences of opinion. Students will
not be judged on whether or not they agree with the [instructor](pyle.html) on
any issue but rather on the substance of their scholarship and their
willingness to engage in a serious examination of competing points of view and
positions.**

Computer Law Spring 2001 Syllabus







Computer Law
          Prof. Mark Lemley
          Spring 2001





This is an advanced course on the law governing computer software. A 
        major focus of the course will be on intellectual property protection 
        for computer software, with some discussion of intellectual property on 
        the Internet as well. The course will also touch on contract and tort 
        problems in the licensing of software and digital information, and antitrust 
        issues in the computer industry. The course is designed for students with 
        some knowledge of intellectual property law who wish to do in-depth work 
        in the application of intellectual property law to computer technology. 
        No background in computer science is required, although students should 
        be willing to be exposed to some of the technical details of how programs 
        are written. At least one prior course in intellectual property law (or 
        consent of the instructor) is required.
The text for the class is Mark Lemley, Peter Menell, Robert Merges 
        & Pamela Samuelson, Software and Internet Law (Aspen Law and 
        Business 1st ed. 2000). The text is available in at the bookstore. In 
        addition, students may find a general intellectual property statutory 
        supplement helpful, although it is not required. One such supplement, 
        Merges et al., Intellectual Property in the New Technological 
        Age: 2000 Statutory Supplement, is available at the bookstore as well. 
        [Those of you who took Introduction to Intellectual Property in the fall 
        should already have a copy of this book]. Finally, because computer law 
        is a rapidly changing field, we maintain an update Web page for the book 
        at http://www.law.berkeley.edu/institutes/bclt/pubs/swbook/. 
        You should treat this Web page as part of the regular reading assignment, 
        and check it when you do your reading for each class.
There are two requirements for the class. The first is a final exam. 
        It will be an essay exam, and will cover general knowledge of the legal 
        subjects discussed in class, your ability to identify and analyze legal 
        problems, and policy considerations. Second, students are responsible 
        for class participation. Students are expected and encouraged to participate 
        in all sessions of the class.
The course will be graded primarily on the basis of the final exam. Overall 
        class participation will be graded on a "check-plus", "check", "check-minus" 
        basis, with emphasis on quality rather than quantity of participation. 
        Pluses or minuses will be used as tiebreakers to raise or lower your grade 
        in borderline cases. 
The class meets Monday and Wednesday from 11:10 a.m. to 12:25 p.m. My 
        scheduled office hours are Monday and Wednesday from 2:30 to 4:00 p.m. 
        in Room 347, in Boalt's North Addition. In addition, you should feel free 
        to stop by any other time I am in my office, or to call and schedule an 
        appointment. My office phone number is 643-2670. Finally, you can e-mail 
        me at mlemley@law.berkeley.edu

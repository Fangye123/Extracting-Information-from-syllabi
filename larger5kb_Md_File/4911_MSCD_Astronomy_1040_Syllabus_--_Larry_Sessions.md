##  COURSE SYLLABUS

_**Revised May 2002 -- All is subject to change with notice**_

**Metropolitan State College Department of Physics**  
PO BOX 173362, DENVER, CO 80217-3362  
NC3123 303-556-2454 or Instructor: (303) 691-2172 (home number, call only if
it is _really_ important!)

STUDENT RESPONSIBILITIES: First and foremost, _you_ must keep in touch with
the instructor. If, during the course of the semester, you do not receive an
email or some sort from your instructor for a week or more, something may be
wrong. In such an event you MUST contact your instructor immediately.
Otherwise you may miss important information or changes of schedule. this is
YOUR duty, not your instructor's.

You must read the material in the book and take notes, take the tests or
quizzes, and turn in the activity assignments before the deadline. Although
extensions are sometimes granted for the activities, the instructor is under
no obligation to do so.

There is a lot of material to cover in this class, and the textbook can be
intimidating to some students. Don't let that discourage you, as most students
find that the course is not as difficult as it first appears. Another
instructor suggests that students view the textbook as an "encyclopedia" used
to illuminate the classroom lectures or online notes. We will put a bit more
emphasis on the textbook in this class, but keep in mind that you will be
responsible for the most important material, not the minute detail. Virtually
any student who puts forth a genuine effort can at least pass the course.
Typically, those who receive "F'" are those who just give up. If you have
gotten this far in life, you have what it takes to do well in this
introductory class. All it takes is a little determination and effort on your
part.

However, if you fall behind or suffer some unexpected illness or emergency, it
is _your_ responsibility to seek help and/or withdraw officially from the
class. Deadlines for NC withdrawals are usually posted in the online schedule
and in the printed class schedule. DO NOT ABANDON THIS COURSE WITHOUT
WITHDRAWING OFFICIALLY. Incompletes are not granted in this course except
under extreme circumstances.

COURSE OUTLINE  
_SECTION I: COURSE IDENTIFICATION  
COURSE TITLE: _ ASTRONOMY 1040  
COURSE DESCRIPTION:  
A survey course concerning the history of astronomy, the tools of the
astronomer and the contents of the solar system; the Sun and stars; galaxies
and other objects; the history of the universe. This class includes simple
activities as part of the grade. These will be completed individually rather
than in a lab.

REQUIRED MATERIALS  **  
** Your textbook is _[The Cosmic
Perspective](http://occ.awlonline.com/bookbind/pubbooks/bennett_awl/), _ Brief
Edition __ by Bennet et al, Addison, Wesley, Longman, 2000, available in the
[bookstore](http://www.collegestore.com/default.asp?store_id=4008) Other
reading suggestions may be made from time to time, but this is the only
required text. I strongly suggest that you use a highlighter to emphasize
important material. This will make it much easier for you later. _It may be
helpful to have access to a pair or binoculars or a small telescope._

COURSE DESCRIPTION: This is a "survey" course in astronomy, intended to
introduce the student to basic concepts of both solar system and stellar
astronomy, as well as a brief introduction to cosmology. We will study the
planets, moons, the Sun, stars, galaxies, and the creation and evolution of
the Universe. **** In addition to class notes, each week, one or more sets of
class notes corresponding to the required reading assignment will be posted on
the World Wide Web site, along with other illustrative material, appropriate
links to other Internet sites, and other useful study material. The notes are
intended to illuminate the reading material, and in many cases to provide
background or otherwise interesting material in addition to the reading. Most
if not all of the project assignments will be listed. The student is
responsible for checking the site for new notes at least twice a week.

GRADING: Your final grade will be based on your total scores on tests, papers,
assignments and the final, according to the following percentages:

Tests: |  40% -- Each will likely consist of mostly multiple choice questions,
and will be available online.  
---|---  
Activities: | 35% -- Each will be graded on a basis of 10 points. The
aggregate total will be worth 15% of your final grade.  
Mid-term: | none this semester  
Final: |  25% - Comprehensive and both closed book and closed notes.  
  
  
GRADES: Grades are assessed on a "weighted percentage" basis. This means that
the three assessment areas (tests, activities, final) all carry different
percentages. Points for specific assessments (such as tests) do not carry the
same value as points on otehr assessments (such as activities). Therefore, you
cannot simply add up points totals for a grade.

_Percentage Grade_  
100 - 91 A  
90 - 81 B  
80 - 71 C  
70 - 61 D  
60 - 0 Failing

MAKE-UPS: **** There will be no make-ups unless you meet some very specific
criteria. These are:  
  
_* You are hospitalized or ordered to bed-rest during the time period in
question.  
* A spouse or minor child has been hospitalized during the time period in question.  
* You have experienced the death of a spouse, minor child or immediate parent during the time period in question._

These apply to tests, activities and the final.

INCOMPLETES: I strongly dislike granting incompletes, and they are generally
very difficult to get. If you find that you simply cannot keep up with the
work in this course, your best alternative is to officially withdraw before
the deadline. In order to qualify for an Incomplete, you normally must
complete two-thirds to three-quarters of the class-work. This usually means
that incompletes cannot even be applied for until after the last opportunity
to withdraw from the class. Furthermore, incompletes cannot be granted simply
because you have fallen behind, or because of most personal or financial
difficulties. Incompletes, when granted, usually go to students who have been
active in the class, but because of some unforeseen accident, personal illness
or major personal or family emergency cannot complete the course in the
current semester. Different schools have different policies, but my policy is
that any incomplete granted must be resolved by the end of the next full
semester. Otherwise the grade reverts to an "F." Furthermore, I reserve the
right to stipulate the conditions of completion, which may require a full or
partial retake of the class.

If you fit the criteria above and you feel that you want to apply for an
incomplete, you must have your faculty or academic advisor write me a letter
(not email) stating your case. Incompletes that arrive prior to the last
official withdrawal date will not be considered and will be discarded. Letters
may be sent to me at the school address above.

PREREQUISITES: **** There are no specific prerequisites for this course other
than the normal enrollment requirements for Metro. This is not a mathematics-
based course, but a few basic mathematical skills are required and will be
discussed in class or on-line.

COMPLAINTS AND SUGGESTIONS: There are a wide variety of backgrounds for the
people taking this course. I will try to match the course as closely as
possible to your needs. However, this approach undoubtedly will leave some
people feeling it is too hard, and others feeling that it is too easy. If you
have such a concern, please contact me and I will be happy to work with you to
make this course fit your needs as closely as possible. Please let me know
your complaints about or suggestions for this course. Complaints will not
adversely affect your grade in any way! If something is bugging you, I can't
correct it if I don't know about it. Also, I cannot guarantee what you learn.
I can only provide information and direction. What you learn is up to you, but
I am here to help in any way I can.

PLAGIARISM: Plagiarism is a serious academic offense. Policies relating to
plagiarism vary, but my policy is fairly strict: If I even suspect you of
submitting work that has been plagiarized, that work will automatically be
assigned a score of zero and you _may_ receive a grade of  "F" for the course,
depending on the circumstances. Plagiarism is any instance in which one person
passes off the work of another as his or her own, no matter how small. Any
time you include in any work as little as 5 words of another without proper
credit given to the original source, I will consider it plagiarism. If you
take material from an article or book or Internet source, always put it in
quotation marks and provide a reference (for example: _Sky & Telescope_, June
2000, page 198). The reference should come immediately after the quoated
material, and should also be included in the bibliography at the end of your
work. Even paraphrase quotes should be so referenced. For examples of
plagiarism and how to avoid it, there are many good references on the web.
While I am not a major stickler on the exact form of your references as long
as they have sufficient information. You also can find plenty of information
on making proper references on the web or in the library.

WITHDRAWALS AND OTHER POLICIES: See the Class Schedule for your school or
contact your academic advisor.

EXTRA CREDIT: **** While I reserve the right to change my mind, I am not
giving extra credit this semester. However, I will consider alternate projects
or activities. Contact me if you have questions.

EXTRA HELP: If you are having trouble or need extra help, contact me as soon
as possible. My first and best advice is to arrange your schedule so that you
have time for the course. The semester is too short and moves too fast to put
assignments off.

Center](http://clem.mscd.edu/~writectr/)

Some of the activity projects are designed to allow the student to complete
them independently. _No prerequisites or knowledge of science is required and
all projects are designed such that any student -- regardless of background or
preparation -- should be able to complete them successfully._ Complete
instructions will be given, which if followed exactly, will make these
projects easy. When the use of anything other than ordinary equipment, such as
telescope use, is required, the instructor will assist you. The project
assignments are constantly being refined, so I will not make the specific
assignments here. However, here are _some_ of the projects that likely will be
assigned.

1) Track the Moon and/or planets  
2) Track the Sun's shadow during the day  
3) Measure the diameter of the Sun through simple observation  
4) Analyze photos from the book  
5) Complete one or more of the activities or problems in the book  
6) Observe the planets and Moon (tba with instructor, weather permitting)  
8) other projects to be announced as needed. Most of the projects will be
posted on this web site and will be available for download.

  
PRIVACY: While you do not have to come to an on-campus classroom for this
course, you should nevertheless make an effort to interact with other
students. With this in mind, I may distribute email addresses of all students
to all other students. Just as would be the case in a traditional classroom,
students have the right to know who the other students are and to interact
with them. I encourage this, especially on the required activities. While I
consider student contact information confidential to anyone outside the
course, I do feel that it is necessary to make it available to other
legitimate students. If you have a concern about this, you must discuss it
with me no later than the first week of class.

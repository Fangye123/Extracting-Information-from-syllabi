## Course Description

This course introduces students to the processes and institutional contexts of
political competition in the United States. It places primary emphasis on
institutions (e.g., the Constitution, the Congress, the Presidency, the
Judiciary, the bureaucracy), modes of competition (e.g., elections,
policymaking, direct action), and mechanisms of interest aggregation (e.g.,
political parties, interest groups, the mass media, public opinion).

In the non-Honors sections of this class, the instructor seeks to provide
students the knowledge they need in order to become active, involved citizens.
In the Honors section, the instructor seeks additionally to introduce students
to the critical, scholarly literature on American politics and government, in
order to prepare them for leadership roles in society.

To that end, we will examine and discuss a traditional introductory college-
level text on American politics and government _plus_ the contents of three
scholarly works on the subject. All students will read every other students
review plus a published critical review, so that by the end of the semester we
will all have been exposed to the ideas in 60 or so books.

Each week is divided into two sections. In our Monday seminars, we will
discuss course readings assigned for that week. Students are expected to have
read the assigned materials from the main text and to be prepared to discuss
their contents. These are _seminar_ sessions, not lecture sessions. Our
purpose is to discuss the readings critically, not to sit passively while the
instructor fills our heads with dry facts.

On most Wednesdays, we will discuss student essays of major works on American
politics and government, as described below. Early in the semester, however,
we will focus solely on the main text, so that students will have time to
prepare their essays.

These essays will review the contents of books, cleared in advance with the
instructor, and their review in _The American Political Science Review (APSR)_
or some other scholarly journal. The _APSR_ is available in the stacks of Bird
Library, or online at [ http://www.jstor.org/](http://www.jstor.org/). The
JSTOR site is proprietary and inaccessible unless you use a syr.edu account.
You may access it using a commercial internet service provider by setting your
browser's proxy server to the library proxy. See [
http://libwww.syr.edu/lis/proxy/index.html](http://libwww.syr.edu/lis/proxy/index.html)
for instructions.

Review essays should assess the arguments of both the book author and the
author of the published review. Do their arguments cohere logically? Do their
judgments follow from the evidence they present? Do they consider all the
relevant evidence, etc. Your essays will be graded on these same criteria,
except that the fullness of your review, your writing abilities, and the care
you have taken in crafting your essays will also be considered.

Each student will prepare her essay as a web page. When the essay is available
on the web, students will submit a photocopy of the _APSR_ (or other journal)
review. On this submission, students will clearly identify the URL for the web
page where her review essay can be found. These submissions should be
delivered to the mailbox of John Eliasson, which is located in the workroom of
the Political Science Department, 100 Eggers Hall. _They must be submitted by
Wednesday noon, one week prior to their discussion in seminar_. The journal
reviews will be photocopied and delivered to all students at the next class
meeting. _All students are expected to read every other student's essay and
the corresponding published review_. Students should come to class prepared to
discuss their contents.

Students who do not already know how to author web pages should consult
Computer and Media Services' instructions at [
http://cms.syr.edu/web/](http://cms.syr.edu/web/).

## Texts

Two texts, listed below, have been been assigned for this course. However,
additional readings may be placed on reserve at Bird Library or distributed in
class, as appropriate. The following texts are required purchases:

  * Benjamin Ginsberg, Theodore Lowi, and Margaret Weir, _We the People: An Introduction to American Politics_. 2d ed. New York: W.W. Norton, 1999. 
  * Susan Herbst, _Numbered Voices: How Opinion Polling has Shaped American Politics_. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993. 
The Ginsberg et al. is a standard college-level introductory text, in that it
covers all the typical topics for a course like this one. The focus of the
Herbst book is sharper. It concerns the effects of public opinion research on
American political life.

Both should be eventually be available at the Orange Student Bookstore in
Marshall Square. The Herbst book may not be available at the beginning of the
semester, as it was ordered late. This should pose no special problem, as we
will not be discussing it until late March.

## Grading Criteria

Fifty percent of final grades will be assigned on the basis of performance on
two of three examinations. The lowest of these three grades will be dropped.
On the penultimate class day, April 29, the instructor will announce the names
of students who need not take the third examination, as they will receive an A
grade no matter their performance on that examination. The instructor
considers this a just reward for the demonstration of excellence. It is not
necessarily the case that all students required to take the third examination
will not receive an A grade. Often. a student's strong performance on the
final examination frees her from the albatross of a poor grade earlier in the
semester. Because the instructor drops the lowest grade, _there will be **no**
make-up examinations_. Students who fail to appear for an examination, for
whatever reason -- legitimate or otherwise -- will receive a _zero_ grade.

Review essays will count for 30% of final grades. The remaining 20% will be
assessed on the basis of attendance and the quantity and quality of
participation in seminar.

## Course Schedule

**Bulletin Description:  
** Computer graphics hardware and software, including displays, hardcopy
devices, graphics packages, transformations, projections, scan conversion and
clipping, 3-dimensional viewing, hierarchical object modeling, and rendering.

**Prerequisites:  
** Quarter prerequisite: CS 3620, 3710, Semester prerequisite: CS 2511, Math
1297 or #, or the equivalent if you are a transfer student. **Important
note:** The computer science program at UMD is accredited by CAC (the
Computing Accreditation Commission). One of the CAC requirements is that all
students _must_ satisfy the prerequisites in order to be admitted to a course,
so if you have not passed the prerequisite courses, you will be asked to drop
this course (if you have any questions about this, please see the instructor
after the lecture or during office hours).

**Course Objectives and Content:  
** This course provides an introduction to 2- and 3-dimensional computer
graphics, including basic algorithms and the mathematics behind the
transformations and viewing operations.

The following is an outline of the material to be covered in the course. We
will start with an introduction to computer graphics, followed by a simple
(2D) raster graphics package and its algorithms. Then we will cover
geometrical transformations and viewing in 3D, and use them with a 3D graphics
package. Finally, we will cover material from solid modeling, the theory of
colored light, visible-surface determination, and illumination and shading.

**Equal Opportunity:  
** The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons
shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without
regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital
status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual
orientation. As instructor, I am committed to upholding University of
Minnesota's equal opportunity policy. I encourage you to talk to me in private
about any concerns you have related to equal opportunity in the classroom. To
inquire further about the University's policy on equal opportunity, contact
the Office of Equal Opportunity, 255 DAdB, [

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have any disability (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect your ability to perform in this class, please inform me at the start of
the quarter. I may adapt methods, materials, or testing so that you can
participate equitably. To learn about the services that UMD provides to
students with disabilities, contact the Access Center/Disability Services 138

**Text:  
** _Introduction to Computer Graphics,_ by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, Hughes, and
Phillips, Addison Wesley, 1990, 1994. ISBN: 0-201-60921-5

Or:

_Computer Graphics: Principles and Practice,_ by Foley, van Dam, Feiner, and
Hughes, Addison Wesley, 1990, 1996. ISBN: 0-201-84840-6

**Course Directory:  
** There is additional, important information, including information on the
graphics packages we will be using, in the class directory:  
**`/opt/local/studata/COURSES/cs5721`**  
There is a **`README`** file in that directory that explains what is in the
files and subdirectories.

**Course Requirements:  
** You are responsible for reading assigned text material and for material
covered in class, including:

  1. doing the reading assignments from the text 
  2. the material covered in the lectures 
  3. obtaining assignments and handouts 
  4. turning in programming assignments and homework  

If you are unable to attend a class meeting, it is your responsibility to
obtain class notes, assignments, and extra copies of handouts from your study
partner. **Note:** all assignments are due at the _beginning_ of class on the
due date. Assignments will be docked 25% per day if turned in late.

**Assignments:  
**

Except for the first assignment (which may be done in any language), the
software that we will be using for this course requires that programs be
written in C or C++. The programming assignments should adhere to the [
Computer Science Lab Report Format ](labinfo/labformat.html)

**Examinations and Grading:  
**

There will be a midterm exam, worth 100 points and a final exam worth 180
points. These exams are closed book. The final exam will be comprehensive.
Exams will _not_ be given early, and makeups must be justified by dire
circumstances described to the instructor _before_ the time of the exam. It is
Department of Computer Science policy not to return final exams, however they
are kept and you can look at your exam in the instructor's office.

**Exam Schedule:** **Exam**|  **Points**|  **Date and Time  
---|---|---  
Midterm Exam |  100 points  |  Wednesday, October 24, 1-1:50 pm in HH 302  
Final Exam |  200 points  |  Wednesday, December 19, 4-5:55 pm in HH 302  
  
Scores and total points will be posted periodically on the "` Grades`" page of
the class web site:  
[
http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs5721/grades](http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs5721/grades)  
using the last four digits of your student id number. If you wish to have your
scores posted using a number other than your student id, you may email your
request to the instructor.

**Grading Procedures:** Final grades are based on total points distributed
approximately as follows:

  * Lab assignments (approx. 300 points) 
  * Midterm Exam (100 points) 
  * Final Examination (200 points) 
Grades are assigned based on a percentage of the total points.

  * The A- cutoff is 90% 
  * The B- cutoff is 80% 
  * The C- cutoff is 70% 
  * The D cutoff is 60% 
  * Below 60% is an F 
These percentages may be lowered slightly but they will not be raised.

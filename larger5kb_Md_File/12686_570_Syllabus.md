### **COURSE SYLLABUS** ** **

**ED 570:   Voice, Diversity, Equity and Social Justice**   **
**3 units **_ _**

#### **_Prerequisites_** **:**  

ED.492 & ED.401 or concurrent enrollment.  Acceptance into a credential
program. _ _

#### **_Catalogue Description_** **: **

This course focuses upon the disenfranchised of California's schools,
including females, the disabled, nonwhite children, and the poor, with
particular emphasis on the unique challenges such diversity brings to the
classrooms.  Emphasis is given to the history, culture and expectations of
these groups as they apply to teaching and counseling through the lens of the
History/Social Science Framework.  Fills requirements for the Multiple,
Single, Special Education credentials and CLAD certificate. Authentic
experiences in the field will be required for a minimum of 15 hours.

#### **_ASSUMPTIONS AND METHODOLOGY UPON WHICH THIS CLASS IS BASED_**

1.   Addressing the needs of today's diverse students requires dramatic changes in the way we have approached education in the past.  All students will be better supported if a team of people collaboratively share in the responsibility of education.  Each individual has unique skills/abilities/ experiences to offer, and therefore is a respected and valued team member.  In sustaining a collaborative work culture the need for flexibility is a "given."  This will require creative use of personnel and alternative structures.

2.   Teaching is not a matter of transmitting stored information, concepts, and patterns of thinking from one person to another; rather it is a way of working with students to facilitate their acquisition of information, attitudes, and skills so that they may understand and cope with their environment.  Meaningfulness is personal and depends on the amount of participation and willingness to take a risk.  Risk-taking requires venturing into new arenas and learning to living with a degree of ambiguity.

3.   It is impossible within any course to anticipate, examine, and find answers to every problem that will face you as a teacher.  Many questions have no "correct" answers.  Problems and perplexities of teaching in a diverse classroom require the combined efforts of many so that at least partial and tentatively useful approaches may be developed.

4.   Classroom experiences will provide specific content as provided in this syllabus and model instructional strategies and practices that we encourage students to use in their future teaching experiences. While this class is not a methods course, both content and process can be learned and used.

#### **_COURSE OBJECTIVES_** **:**

1.   to introduce the concepts of social justice and the teacher as an empowered professional able to facilitate equity in the classroom.

2.   to facilitate a beginning knowledge of the immigrant experience in the U.S. and California, including the history and culture shaping the experiences of Asian, Hispanic and nonwhite children in the public school. To step into the other's shoes and identify with that person's thought patterns and value structure.

3.   to introduce the History-Social Science Framework (or other subject area framework for single subjects)  and make empowering connections.

4.   to deconstruct observed lessons and re-construct plans that exemplify cultural understanding, equity and inclusive participation. 

5.   to grapple with the issues of culture, class, disability and gender as they influence teacher expectations, curriculum, teaching styles and classroom structure.

6.   to recognize and identify elements of discrimination in school settings/curriculum and to facilitate the development of equity and promote social justice within the school and community.

7.   to value parent and community involvement and bring minority and/or impoverished families into the school as equal partners with the educational community.

8.   to begin to thoughtfully envision ways to create a learning environment of respect where students from varied backgrounds and with varied abilities can make meaningful personal choices while feeling supported and challenged.

9.   to introduce effective practices that encourage acceptance of ALL children within the classroom without loss of individual voice, cultural identity or at the expense of others.

10.  to begin the process of identifying and labeling effective instructional strategies for use with diverse learners.

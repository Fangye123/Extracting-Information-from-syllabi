Purpose and Structure of the Course**_

This course will introduce some of the basic concepts in the study of world
politics. It is a survey course and assumes no prior knowledge or experience
in the study of International Relations. The first half of the course will
focus on the traditional perspectives in world politics; the second half of
the course will emphasize new challenges to the study of world politics. The
course will be run as a lecture, although questions, comments, and discussion
are always welcome.

**_Course Requirements_**

There will be a weekly quiz on the readings, discussions, lectures, and
current events.    I will take the ten highest grades from these quizzes
(which means you can miss some or I will drop some low grades).  The quiz
grade will constitute 50% of your final grade.

There will be an exercise in [navigating the World Wide
Web.](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/navigate.htm) The [project
](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/project.htm)will count for 50%
of your final grade. If you wish to see examples of last term's projects,
click [here.](http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/webs99.htm)  Jennifer
Shupe, 02 [(jlshupe@mtholyoke.edu](mailto:\(jlshupe@mtholyoke.edu)) will be
the student assistant for the web project.  She will be available for
consultations in 101 Skinner Hall on the following days:  Mondays, 3-5;
Tuesdays 3-5; and Wednesday nights, 7-9.

**_Procedural Matters_**

The readings in the syllabus highlighted in blue and underlined are on the
Internet and can be accessed at
<http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pol116/fall99.htm>.  There are no books
to purchase for this course.  However, you are required to keep abreast of
current events in world politics, and I strongly urge reading a prominent
daily newspaper.  A subscription to a newspaper would be highly recommended. I
will choose questions for the weekly quizzes from the _New York Times_ Online
edition which can be accessed at <http://www.nytimes.com>.  The _New York
Times_ requires you to choose a user name and a password, but there is (as of
yet) no charge to read the paper online.

My office is 103 Skinner, and my office hours are Monday nights, 7-9 and
Tuesday mornings, 10-12. I can also be reached on e-mail:

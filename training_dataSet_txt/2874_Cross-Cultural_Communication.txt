Chin Office: Nebraska Hall, Rm. 336 Office Hours: Mondays 5- 6:30 pm, Tuesdays 1- 4 pm & Wednesday 11:20 AM - 2:00 PM Tel #: 202-885-1823 Cross-cultural communication 33.140 is a foundation-level course in The American University's General Education Program, Curricular Area 3 AThe International and Intercultural Experience.@ Successful completion of the requirements for this course allows you to take one of the following second-level courses: 03.210 Roots of Racism 03.220 Living in Multicultural Societies 12.200 The Global Marketplace 33.255Japan and the United States 33.372 Brussels Seminar (Study Abroad) 33.374 Buenos Aires Seminar (Study Abroad) 37.210 Latin America: History, Art, Literature  Each of these second-level courses will provide opportunities to build on the concepts and ideas introduced in this foundation-level course. The main focus of each of these subsequent courses is on the interaction between and within cultures. In this curricular sub-field, you can focus on cultural concepts, cultures of specific regions, or even study abroad (Belgium, Argentina). Finally, the specific goals of Curricular Area 3 are to help you to understand those habits of thought and feeling that distinguish cultures from one another. Course Description & Objectives In this course, we will examine different conceptualizations of culture, and some of the consequences of cross-cultural communication and interactions. We will compare and contrast cultures in terms of values, thought patterns, and styles of communication. The approach at times, will be historical, and also necessarily interdisciplinary with particular attention paid to cross-cultural communication at the interpersonal, intranational, and international levels. The course, which is taught within the School of International Service, will examine the worldviews of Americans and and peoples from different countries, together with the cultural bases of institutions such as the domestic/Aglobalized@ workplace and mass media. This course is designed to help you  better understand your own cultural values and unstated cultural assumptions which, at times, may and can cause conflict in communication with members from another cultural and/or national group(s). Understanding the dynamics of cross-cultural communication, interaction, and institutions, should facilitate the reexamination of rules that proscribe and prescribe behaviour, and also generate effective ways to bridge seemingly immutable differences.  II. Requirements Class Discussions: 10% of Final Grade Attendance is MANDATORY. A letter from the Dean's office or a medical note is required if the student is unable to attend class. Unexcused absences will be reflected in the final grade. At every class, students are expected to have completed the required readings for that class, and are prepared to discuss key concepts found in the readings.  Team presentation on History of Immigration in US: 10% of Final Grade Each team will conduct research and present their findings on the immigration of a particular racial-ethnic group in the US. Group Debate: 15% of Final Grade Groups, topics, and schedule of debates will be arranged within the first few weeks of classes. Each group is expected to conduct research on the assigned debate topic. Mid-term: 20% of Final Grade The in-class mid-term exam is scheduled for Wednesday, Oct 14.  Students are expected to answer 4 out of approximately 5 essay questions that focus on applying/analyzing cross-cultural concepts discussed in class lectures and readings. Journal: 15% of Final Grade Throughout the semester, students are expected to keep a journal (typed, not hand-written) on  critical reflections of readings, class discussions, debates, and team work. The instructor will periodically ask students to turn in the journals. Completed journal is due 12:00 PM Friday, Dec 11 in SIS Faculty Services Office. Please ask the receptionist to stamp and sign the cover sheet. Journals are expected to be well-written (syntax, grammar, etc) and to have specific references to readings (students are expected to complete every reading assigned in the course) in addition to class discussions (e.g., cultural observations tied to the readings). Team Paper: 20% of Final Grade Presentation of Team Paper: 10 % of Final Grade The class will be divided into teams of 4-5 students (depending on class size). To the extent that is possible, the teams will be multicultural. The study of cross-cultural communication does not merely involve reading books and listening to lectures. A key objective of the model of team-led research projects is to encourage male and female students from different classes, racial-ethnic groups, and religious affiliations to work together in pursuit of a common goal. The processes of conducting team research and the final product of the team research will more than likely depend on how team members are able to negotiate  differences, and subsequently cooperate to produce a well-researched and well-written team paper.  The possible research topics are:  (a) Interracial/ Interethnic relations (e.g., Black/White relations or ethnic conflict in Asia, Europe, etc.) (b) Multiculturalism at the workplace (c) Intergender relations (d) Religion and Politics (e.g., Islamic revivalism, Christian Coalition, etc.) (e) Culture and the Media I (e.g., news media and international crisis) (f) Culture and the Media II (e.g., entertainment industry and the production of culture) During the early part of the semester, members of each team should get together and decide on the most appropriate manner in which to pursue the research topic, and also to determine the division of  labour among team members. Each team is required to meet with the instructor at least twice during the semester. The paper outline, with suggested bibliography, is due on Wednesday, September 16.   ***On Wednesday September  23, every team should submit a report that outlines the duties and responsibilites of each member within the team re: debates and research paper. At the end of the semester, every team will be required to submit a final report on the productivity of each member and the entire team. The instructor will take into consideration the reports when assigning final grades.*** The final paper is due at 11:20 AM, in class, on Wednesday December 9. The paper should be approximately 15 - 20 pages in length, type-written, double-spaced with complete footnotes or endnotes and bibliography.  NOTE: The final paper must reflect group effort as opposed to a compilation of individual papers.   Members of each team will be asked to evaluate his/her team members= performance. Evaluation sheets will be handed out within the first few weeks of the course. First set of evaluations will be due at mid-term. Final set of evaluations will be due on the due date of the final team paper. The evaluations will focus on attendance, defining and meeting objectives, cooperation, and so forth. Presentations of research projects will take place on  11/4, 11/18, 12/2, and 12/9. Each team should be prepared to take approximately 30 minutes for the presentation and 15 minutes for questions afterward. Creative methods of presentations such as the use of audiovisual devices and so forth are encouraged. DO NOT repeat what is already written in the team papers. Rather, the goal is to present the material in a manner that engages the audience. Presentations will be graded on team members=ability to present their work in an articulate, engaging, and timely manner. The entire class will be asked to submit evaluations of each team=s presentation and the evaluations will be considered in assigning the grade. This course has been designed to give students ample time to conduct research, and to write-up the final team papers. PLEASE NOTE: I WILL NOT ACCEPT ANY TEAM PAPERS THAT ARE HANDED-IN AFTER  WEDNESDAY, DECEMBER 9. It is the responsibility of each team to keep me informed of the progress and/or problems encountered during the semester.  ***With the exception of emergency cases that are confirmed by the Dean's Office, no incompletes will be given in this course.*** Required Texts  Hall, Edward.

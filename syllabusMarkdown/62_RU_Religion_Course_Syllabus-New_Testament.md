_**  
Purpose**_ : This course will review the early history of psychoanalysis in
America. We will chart the changes that take place in psychoanalytic
theorizing as the field moves further from its European roots. We will pay
special attention to the interest in religion on the part of many of the first
generation of analysts in America and situate the early dialogue between
psychoanalysis and theology in its historical context and address as well as
the ongoing interest in psychoanalysis and Buddhism.

_**  
Requirements**_ : This class will be conducted as a seminar and so it is
expected that students will have done the reading and will come to each class
prepared to participate. Class participation will be a major part of the final
grade. To facilitate discussion, students are required to hand in two, brief
(4-5 page) critical reviews of readings before the two weeks devoted entirely
to discussion. They are due by the start of class on 2/27 and 3/27. _No
extensions will be given_. In addition, an essay of 8-10 pages is due by noon,
one week after the last day of class, on 5/13/02, on the following topic:
Drawing on the relevant figures from this course, discuss some of the
implicit assumptions about human nature and human understanding found in
American psychoanalysis. How do these assumptions both open up and limit the
dialogue between psychoanalysis and religion? _No extensions will be given._

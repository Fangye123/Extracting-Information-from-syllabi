the history and historiography of the last half or the Twentieth Century.

class will be responsible for reading the common (core) assignments.  Most of
you will be responsible posting a brief, 3-5 page commentary on these
readings.  At least two or three of you will be responsible for posting (and

>   * **H-DIPLO ROUNDTABLE REVIEW**

>  
> On February 1, a group of U.S. diplomatic historians began a roundtable
discussion of a recently published book on Lyndon Johnson's decision to
escalate the Vietnam War: Fredrik Logevall, _Choosing War: The Lost Chance for
Peace and the Escalation of War in Vietnam_ (University of California Press,
1999). I have posted the core of this discussion on our Lotus Notes class
database.   If you want to follow the discussion that followed, which included
a number of additional historians (including David Kaiser, whose new book on
Kennedy, Johnson and Vietnam has just appeared), you may do so by clicking on
**[HDiplo Roundtable on Logevall](http://h-net.msu.edu/cgi-
bin/logbrowse.pl?trx=lx&sort=3&list=h-diplo&month=0002&week=&user=&pw=) ** and
scrolling down to Loyd Gardner's introduction to the Forum.  (It takes a long
time to load, so be patient.)

>

> In the essay you post for Monday's discussion, focus on what the debate over
Logevall's book reveals about the current state of the historical literature
on the Vietnam War.

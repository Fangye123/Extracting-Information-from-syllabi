Course Description:  
This course examines the major means by which teachers have tried to teach
second/foreign languages. It introduces the basic theoretical issues in modern
language teaching and, as such, provides a bridge between the theory of second
language acquisition and second language classroom practice. It is
specifically designed to help you gain an understanding of the major teaching
and research issues in the field of second/foreign language pedagogy so that
you have a firm foundation for f urther development as a professional language
instructor. It will provide you an opportunity to examine and integrate your
past and present teaching and learning experiences with an understanding of
the theory of language learning and teaching.  
The course has two themes. One is a historical overview of trends in language
teaching, and an analysis of the theories of language and language learning
that form their bases. The other theme of the course is an exploration of
issues and an evalu ation of materials for second language instruction in the
basics of grammar and vocabulary, as well as the four skill areas, i.e.
reading, writing, speaking and listening. Integration of the skills in task-
based learning, project work, and content-based instruction will also be
explored.  
(Note: A continuation of this course, Linguistics 446/546 Second Language
Teaching Practice, is offered during the Spring term in the Linguistics
Department. In that class you will learn how to apply the principles you learn
this term.)  

* * *

  
Course Goals: By the end of this course, you should be able to  
1\. identify, compare, and contrast differing models of language teaching, and
apply such knowledge to an increased understanding of your own teaching
practice;  
2\. understand and discuss intelligently the pedagogical literature on the
teaching of grammar and vocabulary, and the component language skills of
speaking, listening, reading and writing across the second language
curriculum;  
3\. articulate a rational basis for the design, development, implementation,
and evaluation of instructional materials for second language learning;  
4\. gain the ability to analyze language teaching techniques and materials for
their strengths and weaknesses and for the teaching situations to which they
are most suited;  
5\. identify relevant resources for future research reference and professional
development in the field of second language teaching and learning, in
particular learning how to access resources available through the internet.

Materials:  
A. There are two required textbooks:  
1\. Richards, J.C., & Rogers, T.S. (1989). Approaches and Methods in Language
Teaching. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  
2\. Nunan, D. (1991). Language Teaching Methodology. London: Prentice-Hall.  

* * *

B. There is one optional textbook and an optional (but highly recommended)
dictionary:  
1\. Larsen-Freeman, D. (1986). Techniques and Principles in Language Teaching.
New York: Oxford University Press.  
2\. Richards, et. al. (1987). Longman Dictionary of Applied Linguistics.  

* * *

C. There is a (small) required course packet:  
1\. Ling: 445/545: Observation module materials  
Requirements: A basic philosophy of this class is LEARNING BY DOING.
Therefore, the class format will be as experiential as possible:
demonstrations, analyses, and critique. Because what goes on in class is meant
to involve you as a language learner/t eacher, class attendance is extremely
important. Furthermore, the ability to intelligently analyze and critique what
we do in class is dependent on your maintaining your background reading
schedule. You are responsible for information in the reading ass ignments even
if we haven't discussed a particular point in class. Be sure to ask about
anything you find problematic in the reading or anything that you feel
conflicts with what you hear in class.

Evaluation:  
1\. Observation reports (two) 20% Due March 2, 4:00, in-class  
2\. Midterm examination 30%  
3\. Project 50%  
Oral presentation 10% Due March 9 or 11, in-class  
"Written" presentation 40% Due March 20, 1:00, 257 Straub  
(NB you will provide both hard copy and diskette copy of your project. We will
be working on developing a website for the materials you produce--if you'd
like to help with this effort, let us know.  
Description of the observation reports: You will learn how to do this
assignment in the discussion sections, where a great deal of time will be
devoted to training you to become a skilled classroom observer, i.e. a person
who is able to observe with und erstanding. As part of this training you will
view videotapes of real classes, fill out observation sheets, and discuss and
compare your observations with your classmates and GTF. When you go to actual
classes to observe, it will be important for you to remember that you will be
an outsider who has been granted permission to view the workings of a "mini-
culture." Therefore, it will be very important for you to respect that culture
; consider this a cross-cultural experience. Jong-Bai will facilitate your
observations through the different language departments, and you will be
carefully instructed on how to be a good cross-cultural observer.  
  
  

* * *

Description of the midterm: This will be a rather late in-class, closed-book
exam, given during the 50-minute discussion section. The purpose of the exam
is for you to review and synthesize the historical backgound, methods, and
teaching principles we w ill have covered, and to make sure you are reasonably
conversant with the special purpose vocabulary of this profession. The exam
will consist of some objective, yet analytic, questions. The questions are
designed to get you to think about how various m ethods and techniques relate
to a given issue or problem in language teaching.  
  

* * *

Description of the project: We will be introducing the options you will have
for satisfying this requirement in the internet orientation sessions during
the first week of class. The overall goal for the projects is to familiarize
you with CALL and the r esources available on the internet for language
teachers. The options essentially consist of:  
1\. a traditional paper, but using some resources from the internet (see
descriptions below)  
2\. development of a multimedia teaching unit based at least in part on
resources available on the internet  
3\. an extended observation/participation in an AEI CALL course (+ write up).  
(Note: If the scope of what you want to do is quite large, we can consider the
option of a team/group project. See me if you want to take up this option.)  
  

* * *

Paper option for 445 students: This paper is an opportunity for you to read
more in-depth on a topic in second language teaching that is of special
interest to you. The topic might or might not be one that we touch on in
class, but should be centrally lo cated in the area of second language
teaching. You will focus on a particular issue in second language teaching
(please don't feel confined to the list of suggested topics below), and frame
a question or questions in your area of interest that your paper will seek to
answer. Questions might be historical in nature, e.g. How has the place of
pronunciation teaching changed with changes in language teaching approach? Or
they might be synchronic, e.g. What are the principles guiding English for
Specific Purposes curriculum development, and how are they operationalized?  
Please have your topic "cleared" by Jon-Bai or me to make sure it meets the
intent of the assignment.  
Your paper will clearly indicate the question(s) you plan to explore and why
you chose this area (for example, some experience in your own language
learning history), responses that the literature has provided, and your
reactions to the literature, i ncluding what you see as useful to you as a
teacher, and the areas that you believe need more attention and/or research.  
Your paper will be a maximum of ten double-spaced pages (with normal margins
and 12-point font). You must read 5 to 8 articles from reputable applied
linguistics journals (see suggested list) or collected works volumes,
INCLUDING AT LEAST 2 RESOURCE S YOU GET FROM THE NET. If you want to read in
another type of book, estimate a fair equivalent or negotiate with one of us.
Of chief importance is to gain a wide variety of perspectives, so don't plan
on reading only one or two authors. Please use the APA format for your
citations; see any recent TESOL Quarterly article as a model. Include a
WEBLIOGRAPHY of your internet resources The oral presentation will take place
in class. Essentially you will prepare a visual representation (i.e. poster)
of your report and be prepared to give a short orientation and answer
questions on your topic. You can consider it to be an oral firs t draft of
your paper.  
  

* * *

Paper option for 545 students: As with the assignment for 445, this paper is
an opportunity for you to read more in-depth on a topic in second language
teaching that is of special interest to you. However, as a graduate student it
is important that you b egin to focus on the research side of language
teaching, too. If this were a 14 week class, I would ask you to actually
design and carry out a research paper; since this is only a 10 week course I
am asking you to design a project, but you will not carry it out (...this
term. I hope you will at some future date.) The topic might or might not be
one that we touch on in class, but should be centrally located in the area of
second language teaching. You will focus on a particular issue in second
language teaching (please don't feel confined to the list of suggested topics
below), and frame a question or questions that your research proposal is
designed to answer. Please have your proposal "cleared" by me to make sure it
meets the intent of the assignme nt.  
Your paper will have 4 parts:  
1\. 100 word abstract: should summarize the proposal's discussion of points
2-4 below.  
2\. Conception and definition of the project: describe the specific research
planned, including an explanation of the basic ideas, problems or questions to
be explored.  
3\. Plan of work and methodology: outline the plan of work or research
methodology appropriate to your project. Address if applicable: What are the
stages to be carried out and what is planned for each stage? Where will the
study be conducted? What k inds of data analysis will be conducted? What
performances, products or other outcomes can be expected.  
4\. Significance of the project: emphasize the significance of the proposed
work and its anticipated contribution to the state of knowledge or practice in
the field of second language learning and teaching.  
Your paper will be a maximum of fifteen double-spaced pages (with normal
margins and 12-point font). Take some time to browse through recent journals
and collected volumes (several are on reserve in the library) to see what
questions second language professionals are asking and how they are attempting
to answer them. You must read 8 to 10 articles from reputable applied
linguistics journals (see suggested list) or collected works volumes,
INCLUDING AT LEAST 2 RESOURCES YOU GET FROM THE NET. If you want to read in
another type of book, estimate a fair equivalent or negotiate with one of us.
Of chief importance is to gain a wide variety of perspectives, so don't plan
on reading only one or two authors. Please use the APA format for your
citations; see any recent TESOL Quarterly article as a model. Include a
WEBLIOGRAPHY of your internet resources The oral presentation will take place
in class. Essentially you will prepare a visual representation (i.e. poster)
of your proposal and be prepared to give a short orientation and answer
questions on your topic. You can consider it to be an oral first d raft of
your paper.  
Options 2 and 3: These are less traditional options for a grade and therefor
not as easily described. To keep in the spirit of the assignment, the end
product should essentially represent an effort equal to or greater than what
is expected for the 445 a nd 545 paper options described above. To make sure
that you are in compliance with this expectation, establish and maintain a
dialogue with Jong-Bai and me regarding your work.

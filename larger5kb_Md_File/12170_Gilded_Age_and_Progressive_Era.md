1\. COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course examines the social, political, economic, and cultural changes
that occurred in the United States from the end of Reconstruction to the end
of World War I.  Taken together, the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era
comprise one of the most critical periods in American history.  As one texts
explains, "Between 1877 and1919, our country's population, physical size, and
gross national product all doubled.  America changed from a fundamentally
agrarian to a largely urban and industrial society.  Immigrants flooded in to
man the expanding factories, while burgeoning rail and shipping industries
made it easier for families to relocate.  Housing preferences, consumer
choices, educational standards, religious beliefs, political parties,
recreational pursuits, and lifestyles also underwent a profound
transformation."  In sum, the four decades covered here mark the transition to
"modern" life as we know it today.

2\. COURSE OBJECTIVES  Upon successful completion of this course students will
be able to:

 1) identify and explain the significance of key individuals, events, and
terms to the period under consideration;  
 2) discuss the relevance of these individuals, events, and terms to our
understanding of life in the United States today; and  
 3) demonstrate improved critical reading, writing, and thinking skills.

3\. TEACHING METHOD   (lecture, laboratory, audio-visual, clinical experience,
discussion, seminar, tutorial)

This is an upper-level course designed for advanced undergraduates interested
in mastering a specific era in American history.  It will mainly consist of
guided discussions based on common readings.  Mini-lectures will be included
as necessary.

4\. GRADING POLICY  (i.e., number of graded assignments, weight given to
each). Your grade for HI345 will be based on the following:

> _Attendance, evidence of preparation, and participation: 15%_.   Because
discussions are such an integral part of this course, your presence and active
participation are required.  I expect everyone to complete the assigned
readings beforehand and to come to class prepared to discuss them
intelligently.  Note that I take attendance every day and grade comments in
terms of quality as well as quantity.  If you have more than two unexcused
absences, your grade for this portion will be severely compromised.  If you
have more than six unexcused absences, then I will fail you for the course.  
>  _Mid-term exam: 20%_.   Short identifications and essay format.  
>  _5-6pp critical book review on L. Frank Baum, The Wizard of Oz: 15%_ _._
Due in class on the date specified below.  Late papers will lose a full letter
grade per day.  Visit [Dr. M's Oz Page](oz.html) for further information.  
>  _Research project: 30%._ There are two options.

>

>> A) 10-12pp research paper designed to expand on a topic related to this
course.  
>  B) Webpage designed to expand on a topic related to this course.  Students
who choose this option will be held to the same scholarly standards of
research, analysis and writing, but can be more creative in terms of
presenting the material (fonts, images, links, etc).

>>

>> Either way, please note that your work should be more analytical than
descriptive, and it must have the following:  
>      1) an intro paragraph that states your thesis clearly.  
>      2) endnotes/footnates that follow a formal, academically-accepted style
(History majors must use Chicago Style).  
>      3) a minimum of five primary and eight scholarly secondary sources.
One of each must be taken from Fink, Major Problems.  
>      4) my approval.  
>  Projects are due on the date specified.  Late projects will lose a full
letter grade per day.  No exceptions save for personal illness or Acts of God.
Just for the record, last-minute computer and/or printer problems are not Acts
of God. See the Research Project Page Link, above, for more info.

>

> _Final exam: 20%_.   Not cumulative.  Same format as mid-term.

6\. REQUIRED OR SUGGESTED READINGS OR AUDIO-VISUAL MATERIALS

_  DISCLAIMER:_  If you haven't taken the second half of the U.S. survey, then
you will have difficulty succeeding in this course.  I recommend that you skim
through a standard textbook to get thoroughly familiar with the period from
1877-1917.  I have several in my office, and there are others in the History
and Politics library.

> **Course Description**

>

> This course explores selected themes in modern world history. We will focus
particularly upon cultural, political, and economic exchange between the
world's great peoples.

>

> The major themes of the course will include:

>

>> The role of slavery in the world economy  
> The rise of capitalism and industrialism  
> Colonialism and Imperialism  
> The emergence and spread of nationalism  
> The legacy of the great modern political revolutions

>

> This course is required for History, Politics, and Law majors at Webster
University. Beyond our substantive goals, the aim of the course is to help
students develop the reasoning and analytic skills which are required for
success in other departmental courses. For this reason, we may take time to
work on strategies and tools for effective writing and argumentation.

>

> **Requirements**

>

> **_Reading_**  
>  Readings must be completed by the dates indicated on the syllabus. Not all
readings will be discussed in class, but every text will be important for
framing our discussions, filling in details, and helping you to think
creatively and analytically about world history.

>

> **_Study Questions & Quizzes_**  
> You will frequently be assigned study questions on the required readings.
The links to study questions can be found online, organized by date. Your
responses are due by Wednesday at noon, either in my department mailbox or via
email.

>

> Study question responses must follow the rules of proper grammar and
punctuation: Do not submit notes or lists. Your responses may be as long or as
short as you feel is necessary to adequately answer the questions. They will
not be graded but will count toward your class participation grade.

>

> If sending your responses via email, I would prefer that they come as an
attachment in WORD or WORD-PERFECT. Please write "world systems" on the
subject heading of these emails. My email address is wrosenbl@webster.edu

>

> For those dropping off hard (printed) copies of the study question
responses, my box is in mailroom on the second floor of Priest House.

>

> On days where there are no study questions due, there will probably be an
in-class, multiple choice quiz. If possible, I will  post "review questions"
for these quizzes on the website.

>

> **_Attendance and Participation_**  
>  Attendance and participation in class discussion are mandatory. _NO
distinctions will be made between "excused" and "unexcused" absences._ You can
receive partial credit for a missed class by submitting a 3-4 page paper the
following week. Make-up papers will be on a topic of your choosing. The paper
should demonstrate your engagement with the readings assigned for the missed
class. The more thoughtful and interesting the make-up paper, the closer you
will come to getting full credit for the absence.

>

> Students who miss more than two classes -- unless they have made special
arrangements -- should expect to fail the class.  
>  
>

> **_Exams_**  
>  There will be two take-home exams and an in-class final. They will be
scheduled as follows:

>

> Take-home Essay Exam 1.  Due Week 3. Nov 7  
> Take-home Essay Exam 2.  Due Week 6. Nov 28  
> Final Exam. Week 8. Dec 12

>

> The take-home exams will require that you answer one or two questions in
essay form. They are essentially papers, differing only in the sense that I am
_somewhat_ less concerned about originality and style and somewhat more
concerned with seeing thorough, comprehensive, and direct responses to the
questions.

>

> The final exam will will include questions requiring short written responses
and a multiple-choice section. Check the [study
guide](http://www.webster.edu/World System - EightWeek
Version/Exam_Final_Study_Guide.htm) for more details.

>

> **_Reports_**  
>  You will be required to make one short oral report on a contemporary issue
or event somewhere beyond the borders of the United States. Reports must be
based upon information gathered from two or more sources listed on my
[homepage](http://www.webster.edu/~wrosenbl/www.webster.edu/~wrosenbl) under
the heading "News on Politics & International Affairs."

>

> Reports should be 5 to 15 minutes in length. You will summarize a piece of
international news and then discuss the issues it raises within a relevant
historical context. The historical focus can be of your choosing and may or
may not draw upon materials we have discussed in class.

>

> For example, if you are discussing the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations, you
may provide the class with a bit of background on the history of Zionism, the
history of Arab nationalism, or the history of international diplomacy and
imperial conflict in the Middle East. You could also combine all three topics.
The key is to use history to illuminate the origins and the meaning of an
event, a conflict, or a controversy.

>

> Reports may be given during any week in the semester, but you will be
expected to commit to some date by week 3.  
>  
>

> **Grades**  
>  The final grade will be computed more or less as follows:

>

>                 Class Participation: 20%  
>                 Take-home Exams 1-2: 40%  
>                 Final Exam: 40%

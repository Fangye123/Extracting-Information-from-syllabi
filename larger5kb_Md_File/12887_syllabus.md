**URBAN THEORY (3 credits)**  
Spring 1996  
**  
Objectives**  
This course provides an introduction to theories and concepts of economic,
social and cultural factors that shape the spatial structure of our cities and
regions. What we call urban theory in the planning practice today encompasses
interdisciplinary explanations offered by urban geographers, urban
sociologists, urban economists, and urban historians. While maintaining strong
methodological links to their respective disciplines, these interdisciplinary
formulations focus on the built environment as their main subject of
investigation and their analyses inform planners' professional practice.

The course will start by looking at cities in a historical and comparative
perspective. Part I: City in History will provide a comparative survey of
cities in different cultures, places and time periods, and in the imagination
of utopians. The relatively recent history of the city planning profession
will be discussed.

Part II of the course will review theories of the spatial structure of cities
and metropolitan regions. The early representation of cities as marketing
centers for a range of goods of urban geographers, as the outcome of economic
competition for space by urban sociologists, and in terms of spaces where
agglomeration economies for firms can be achieved by urban economists will be
reviewed. The limitation of these theories in explaining the changes observed
in large metropolitan areas over time such as the emergence of suburbs and the
decentralization of employment will be discussed. Alternative perspectives in
understanding the spatial structure of metropolitan areas will be explored.

Part III of the course will introduce the role of political dynamics in
shaping the built environment. The role of different stakeholders in shaping
urban development and redevelopment will be examined. Using these case
studies, special emphasis will be given to the politics of urban renewal in
the 1960s in the U.S., urban redevelopment projects in the early 1980s in
creating segregated and economically polarized communities.

Part IV will discuss the underlying reasons for the emergence of new forms of
cities such as edge cities and new towns, and new types of residential
development such as gated communities.

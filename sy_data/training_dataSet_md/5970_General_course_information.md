## Purpose of course

This course will cover three subjects:

### Data structures

Methods for organizing data in computer memory. How to choose the best ones
depending on properties of the data and requirements for access and updates.

### C++

Building data structures out of C++ arrays and pointers. Using classes and
objects to stay organized and create reusable software.

### Productivity tools

An integrated editing-compiling-debugging environment and project management
software. We will use such tools in a Unix environment.

## Staff

There are pictures.

### Instructor

## Grading policies

### Due dates and late policy

_Assignments are always due at midnight. You loose  20% of the points for each
day of being late._ (You lose the whole 20% at the stroke of midnight.) A
weekend counts as one day.

### Assignments

[Note added later: The term "Do-It-Yourself" assignment was later replaced by
"Take-home exam," which seemed clearer.]

There are a total of seven programming assignments. Two of them, Assignments A
and B, are of the "Do-It-Yourself" kind: You must do them by yourself. The
other five, Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, are of the "Learn-With-Others"
variety: On these assignments you are encouraged to collaborate.

### Lab exams

There will be three "lab exams," where you will be asked to do some
programming in your recitation by yourself and turn in your work
electronically at the end of the recitation.

### In-class exams

There will be one midterm and a final. These are held in the classroom.

### Points and grades

The seven assignments (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, A, and B) are worth 65 points each. The
three lab exams and the midterm are worth 100 points each. The final is worth
200 points. Thus there is a total of 1055 points. [ _Note added later: Lab
exam  3 was cancelled and its 100 points were added to Assignment 5, making
Assignment 5 worth 165 points._]

Getting 900 or more points guarantees you an A, getting 800 or more points
guarantees you at least a B, getting 700 or more points guarantees you at
least a C, getting 600 or more points guarantees you at least a D, getting
less than 600 points may get you an F.

+/- grades will be given to raise some grades. The extent to which this is
done may differ among recitations since their lab exams may turn out to be of
slightly different levels of difficulty (which we try to avoid but which can
happen).

## Collaboration

_You are very much encouraged to collaborate on the "Learn-With-Others"
assignments (Assignments  1, 2, 3, 4, and 5). The two "Do-It-Yourself"
assignments (Assignments A and B) you have to do by yourself._

The recommended mode of collaboration on the "Learn-With-Others" assignments
(Assignments 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) is to write your own program but feel free to
discuss any and all aspects of your program with anyone else, including
details of the code. Naturally, simply copying someone else's code does not
teach you anything except how to use the copy command, which is not a strong
foundation for an illustrious career in the software field. Also be aware that
these "Learn-With-Others" assignments only add up to a fraction of your total
grade. Use them to learn how to do the work so that you can show your
programming competence on the "Do-It-Yourself" assignments and on lab exams.

[A clarification of this policy was posted later.]

_On the "Do-It-Yourself" assignments (Assignments  A and B) no collaboration
of any kind is acceptable._ Treat them like take-home exams that you are
supposed to do by yourself. If you get caught violating this rule you get an F
in the course just as you would if caught copying on an exam.

Obviously the rules of academic honesty as published in the catalog apply
(except for the "Learn-With-Others" assignments as described above). The rules
spelled out above apply to Sections 020 and 030 of CSCI 2270 (taught MWF
1-1:50PM in ECCR 200). Section 010 (taught MWF 11-11:50AM in ECCR 245) has a
different instructor, different assignments, and probably different rules.

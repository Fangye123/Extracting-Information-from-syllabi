#  Geography 3812  
The Geography of Middle and South America

###     Spring Semester 2001  
   Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2:00 p.m. To 3:15 pm.  
   Guggenheim 2

* * *

### Course Purpose

The purpose of this class is to review the processes of economic, political,
social and cultural transformation that have occurred during the second half
of the twentieth century across Latin America. The class will leave
participants with a sensitivity for, and understanding of, critical themes in
Latin American society and development. As such it aims not only to engender a
sense of interest in and passion for the region, but also to develop skills
that will be of use as students move into other upper division courses on
Latin America, international development, environment and development, and
political economy.

* * *

### Course Themes

In the most general sense, Latin American political economy in the 20th
century is punctuated by two moments of transition. The first, at the end of
the 1920s and early 1930s was that of the Great Depression. The impact of the
Depression on Latin America was profound and marked the beginning of a
significant shift in economic policy that ran through to the 1970s and 1980s -
this period was marked by strong government involvement in the economy, and
the beginnings of a progressive urbanization of the region (which carries on
to today). This was also a period of increasingly authoritarian governments
under which human and civil rights were abused. This political context gave
rise to a number of revolutionary movements, some of which were successful
(Cuba, Nicaragua). Others, though less successful, did mean that a number of
countries have been at war with themselves for significant periods of time.
The geography of this political violence has to be central to how we
understand socio-political and cultural change in the region.

A second shift of policy came in the 1980s - related to changes in economic
thinking and to the mounting debt crisis that came to a head in the same
period. In this period, policy became increasingly neo-liberal: that is to
say, increasingly favorable to international and national business and open
trade. It has also been a period of increasingly rapid cultural
"modernization" (or better said americanization). The 1980s and 1990s have
also, though, seen their fair share of oppositional movements - political,
feminist, environmentalist and so on. These movements, as much as national
policy, continue to shape the geographies of the region.

Over the semester we will aim to understand the nature of the transformations
that have occurred in the context of these two broad periods. We will consider
their socio-political, economic and cultural implications, and - importantly -
their geographical form and substance. The most obvious geographical changes
perhaps pertain to urban-rural relationships, and the use of environmental
resources. But beyond these are a host of other geographical patterns and
processes - related to, _inter alia_ : the geographies of protest, civil war
and Marxism; the micro-geographies of gender and culture; the geographies of
religious change; and the geographies of development.

We can talk of these different transformations as both **_combined_** and
**_uneven._** They have been combined in that they have been causally related
to each other, and to the more deeply seated political economic shifts in
Latin American societies. And they have been uneven in the sense that the
forms they have taken have been differentiated, across space and across social
groups. We will aim to develop a sense of this process of change - as both
combined and unequal - by reviewing a range of topics, some of which are
normally touched on in geography classes (like development, political economy,
natural resources) and others which are less normally treated in geography
classes (such as religion, terrorism, and violence).

While the class will be organized by themes, we will keep coming back in class
to examples from four countries as reference points to illustrate our thematic
discussions: these countries will be Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala and Mexico.
Likewise, over the course of the semester class participants will work on
country specific projects and I will ask you to talk about on-going findings
in these projects as the class develops.

* * *

### Course Materials

The course will use different materials to convey its concerns. Much of the
class will revolve around lectures, with discussion time at the end of each
lecture. We will also make good use of films, videos and slides - this will be
important in conveying a visual image of the themes we are addressing. We will
also have occasional guest lectures, in order to bring in points of view and
experiences that differ from my own.

A final and on-going in-put into the course will be the country project that
each of you will work on. While the class is organized by themes, I will ask
each of you to take responsibility for researching those themes as they
pertain to particular countries (see below for more information on the country
project). In the course of the class I will call on you to address the theme
we are discussing from the particular vantage point of your country.

### Course Text and Readings

There is just one text you need to buy for this class. This is a book edited
by Bob Gwynne (a British geographer) and Cristobal Kay (a Chilean political
economist), and it includes chapters by geographers, economists, cultural
studies scholars and sociologists. It therefore gives a nice
interdisciplinary, but still geographical, overview of contemporary
transformations in Latin America. It is:

R. Gwynne and C. Kay (eds.) 1999 _Latin America Transformed: Globalization and
Modernity_. London. Edward Arnold.

It can be purchased in the book store.

In addition to this book, several other readings will be placed on reserve in
the Norlin library on a 2 hour borrowing limit. These include:

The assigned reading load for this class is low (unlike my usual requirements,
which generally involve a great deal of reading). This is not because I expect
you to read little. Rather it is because your country projects will require
significant research and reading from you. I have therefore left space for you
to do this research work.

* * *

### Class Requirements

  1. Class attendance and participation; completion of readings and ability to comment on them in class

* * *

I expect you to attend all classes, unless for reasons of ill health of _force
majeure_. I also expect you to participate in class discussions. I don't
expect this to be too onerous a participation, but I will ask for some
involvement. Likewise I expect you to have read the readings for a given class
prior to its meeting time. I will call on you at times to comment on the
readings. This participation will count for 10 percent of your grade.  
  

  2. Short thought paper

* * *

After the second class you will write a short 2 page double-spaced thought
paper, based on the film The Garden of Forking Paths: Dilemmas of National
Development, and Chapter 1 of Gwynne and Kay. This will count for 6 per cent
of the final grade. Guidelines will be passed out with this syllabus and on
January 18th.  
  

  3. Two mid-term examinations

* * *

There will be two mid-term examinations, each of 60 minutes length. The first
will assess your knowledge of material covered in weeks 1 to 6; the second
will assess your knowledge of material covered in weeks 7 to 13. Each mid-term
will count for 20 percent of the final grade.  
  

  4. 2 short quizzes

* * *

There will be two short quizzes administered in class. These will last only 15
minutes and will assess your knowledge of lecture, reading and visual material
covered prior to that class. Each quiz will count for 7 per cent of the final
grade.  
  

  5. Country project. Done individually but coordinated with a group of students

* * *

While the class is organized by themes, I will ask each of you to take
responsibility for researching certain dimensions of processes of political,
economic, social and cultural change in a particular country in Latin America.
This will mean that over the course of the semester you will build up a sort
of dossier on the country that you chose to work on. At the end of the
semester I will ask you to submit a 6 - 8 page (double spaced) paper that
summarizes your findings on the most important political, economic and
cultural transformations that have occurred since 1950 in your country of
choice. This paper will take the place of the final examination, and will be
handed in on the last day of class. As you do your country projects you can
chose among the following countries:  
  

    * Brazil 
    * Chile 
    * Costa Rica 
    * Jamaica 
    * Nicaragua 
    * Mexico 
    * Peru 
    * Venezuela 

If people feel passionately about a different country we can discuss its
possible inclusion.

As you do these projects there will be 4 or 5 of you working on the same
country, and I will ask you to collaborate as a group and share ideas.
Likewise when at the end of the semester we have presentations on countries,
groups will present together. We will meet prior to these presentations to
discuss what you will say.

The final paper that I will ask of each of you will however be an individual
one - so your grade will not depend on other people. I will give more detail
on these projects early on in the semester. The paper will count for 30
percent of the final grade.

* * *

Short thought paper  
Guidelines**  
  

Assignment: The film, "The Garden of Forking Paths: Dilemmas of National
Development," which you will watch on January 18th, addresses a series of
quite complex relationships between history, politics, culture and economy.
Though it is specifically about Argentina, many of the general issues it asks
us to think about are relevant to much of Latin America and will accompany us
throughout the course.

After seeing the film, I would like you to write a short essay (of 2 pages,
double spaced) discussing what seem to you to be especially important and
interesting themes raised by the film. In particular, I want you to consider
how the film asks us to think about the relationships between economic change,
political change and notions of national identity - and how these
relationships might differ for different social groups living in different
parts of Argentina. How does its approach to these relationships compare with
your own prior thoughts on these relationships in Latin America? Also as you
write, refer to any theme raised by the film that surprised you.

Obviously, at this early stage of the semester you will be writing this essay
somewhat cold and without much information on Latin America. This is fine. I
don't want you to chase up other references or sources to compensate for this
- indeed I want your only source for this essay to be the film itself (though
you may also draw on chapter 1 of the text book if you wish). The essay will
serve as the focal point for our individual meetings on January 31st and
February 2nd. As the semester progresses I will refer back to your essays and
ask you to think if and how your thoughts on these relationships between
economics, politics, culture and history have changed (or not) in the light of
our later readings and discussions.

Date due: Hand the essay in at the end of class on January 23rd.

Length: 2 pages, double spaced, 12 point font, normal margins (use just one
sheet of paper, front and back). Do not go over 2 pages. I want this to be a
short, pithy essay.

Grade: this will count for 6 per cent of your final grade. I will be looking
for clarity of thought and argument, clarity of style, and creative insight as
I mark it. I will mark it out of 10, and if you hand it in late, I will deduct
a mark for each day it is late.

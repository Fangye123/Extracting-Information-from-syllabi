The love lyric ( _ghazal_ ) of the Middle East has been central to Arabic,
Hebrew, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu traditions. It has also had, since the time
of the Troubadours, a strong influence on European conceptions of love and
love lyric. This course will give special attention to the "remembrance of the
beloved" as a cross-cultural symbol from medieval Andalusia to India. Poems
will be read in modern English translations. We will follow the love lyric as
it moves across several cross-cultural genres. Special attention will be given
to the relationship of _imitatio_ to creativity and intercultural competition
in poetic love-poetry, and to the often deliberately obscured relationship
between sacred and profane love. Students with knowledge of one of the
original languages will be encouraged to translate a love poem or _ghazal_. At
the end of the course, each student will be encouraged to compose a
"contemporary American _ghazal_." (These exercises will not be graded, but
credit will be given for particularly strong performances). The Bosnian Love-
Lyric, which draws simultaneously upon Slavic, Arabic, Turkish, and Persian
models will be read as an example of the dynamic interaction among the various
ghazal traditions.

A central problem of interpretation will be the line between sacred and
profane love, and the way the poetic traditions deliberately blur that line;
the relationship of poetry to mystical inspiration and sanctity; and the
poetic tradition as a "counter text" to the Biblical and Qur'anic discourses.

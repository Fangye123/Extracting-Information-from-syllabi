Description:** This course introduces you to major political, economic, and
social changes in the United States from the time of European "discovery" to
the Civil War. It will help you to develop analytical skills [not just what
happened, but some of the reasons why] as well as learning how to articulate
your ideas both verbally and in writing. We will look at major events such as
the American Revolution, the Market Revolution, and the growth of sectional
tensions from the point of view of the ordinary American.

At the end of this course students will be able to:

  * _Summarize_ the major events in American history through 1865
  * _Analyze_ primary source documents
  * _Articulate and support_ (on exams, papers, and in class discussions) a sound position on an historical topic
  * _Compare_ historical events from the perspective of different groups and account for any variation

**

Requirements:** You will have 5 assignments on class readings other than the
Brinkley text. 3 of these assignments will be short 1 page papers. Some will
be done in class, and some will be done at home and turned in at the beginning
of the class period, they will be based on the Primis readings. The 4th
assignment is a short quiz on _Charlotte Temple._ The 5 th is paper based on
one of the slave narratives, it will be a 2-3 typed pages. These assignments
will prepare you for class discussion as well as the exams. **You must
complete all of these assignments in order to pass the class** , however, only
the 4 highest will be used to compute your grade.

There will be 2 in-class exams and a final exam.

Course Policies**: You are expected to attend all class meetings (as per new
university policy, attendance will be taken) and to complete the readings
before the first class meeting each week. Attendance and participation are
assigned as a part of your grade. After three absences you will begin to lose
points. If you will be gone for job related requirements, sporting events,
doctor=s appointments, illness, etc. use these three Afree@ absences.

Any absences after three will only be excused at the instructor=s discretion
and in extreme circumstances (hospitalization, death in the family, etc.) and
with appropriate documentation. Please do not e-mail me telling me you will be
absentBthat is why you get three freebies. After three absences, if you feel
that you have extenuating circumstances warranting an excuse, please come and
see me in person during office hours. **More than 6 absences will result in an
F for this class**.

Response papers assigned as homework are due at the beginning class. Late
assignments will lose one-third of a grade for each day they are late,
including weekends and holidays. Make-ups and late papers are allowed only in
exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation. Students who for
extraordinary reasons cannot meet a deadline should discuss their situation
with the instructors **before the due date**.

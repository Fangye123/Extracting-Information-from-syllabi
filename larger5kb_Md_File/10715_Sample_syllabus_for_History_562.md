### History 562  
History of American Medicine



Students are expected to have in hand in class the following:

  1. Duffy, _From Humors to Medical Science_ (paperback edition, 1993) 
  2. Fox, _Power and Illness_ (paperback edition, 1995) 
  3. Packet of xeroxes available at Bricker Hall Cop-Ez Center. 
  4. Handouts that will be passed out in class from time to time. The assignment sheet will not list all handouts: watch for announcements of ADDITIONAL ASSIGNMENTS. 

Readings may be discussed in class on the day due or any subsequent day (up to
40 additional points for in-class discussion performance: Duffy is a narrative
account and will not be discussed in class, although it will be included in a
major way in examinations). Please note that the reading load will vary much
from time to time; please be sure to read ahead if necessary so as to have
completed each assignment on time.

Attendance is required in this course (not all types of learning can be tested
on an examination). More than three unexcused absences will be penalized at
the rate of 5 points per day.

All students must be officially enrolled in the course by the end of the
second week of the full quarter. No requests to add the course will be
approved by the Department Chair after that time. Enrolling officially and on
time is solely the responsibility of each student.

All students except those graduating will take the final examination at the
assigned time. Students graduating this quarter must notify the instructor by
February 12; the Registrar's office no longer does so in a timely way.

Graduate students will have an additional term paper, arranged individually
with the instructor; a summary report will be given orally on March 13, and
the written final version will be due with the final examination.

**Overview and Objectives**

**This course describes and analyzes the history of America's greatest crisis,
from its origins in the early nineteenth century through the abandonment of
Reconstruction in 1877, with some attention to sectional reconciliation and
the various ways in which the crisis is remembered. It interweaves the
political, military, social, economic, and cultural dimensions of this
experience in roughly equal proportions, with emphasis on the linkages between
them.**

**Students will achieve an understanding of the main developments of the Civil
War and Reconstruction era, the ways in which these developments reflected or
shaped developments in general American history, and the main interpretations
advanced by scholars who have studied this subject. They will also hone their
skills at critical writing and analysis, and will gain greater insight into
the way historians explore the human condition.**

**Enrollment**

**All students must be officially enrolled in the course by the end of the
second full week of the quarter. No requests to add the course will be
approved by the department chair after that time. Enrolling officially and on
time is solely the responsibility of each student.**

* * *

**Make-up Exam Policy**

**If for any family or medical reason you find it absolutely necessary to miss
an examination, you must provide written documentation to substantiate the
request in order to take a make-up. Whenever possible, notify me in advance.
Make-up exams are administered by the department at certain scheduled times
during the quarter. If you take a make-up, it will be at one of these times.**

**Please Note: An on-going family, personal, or medical problem will not be
considered a valid reason to miss more than one examination or quiz. If you
are unfortunate enough to be experiencing such a problem, you are advised to
drop the course instead. If you remain in class, I will assume that you have
made a well-considered decision to remain despite the problem, and that you
accept the consequences of your decision. I will not make exceptions to this
policy, so be forewarned.**

* * *

**Student Deportment**

**Please do not come to class late. If you do, please enter as unobtrusively
as possible. Similarly, if you know you will need to leave early, please seat
yourself close to an exit so that you can leave without distracting other
students.**

**You should also be aware that quizzes are unannounced and will be given
promptly at the beginning of class. If you are late, you will be deemed to
have missed the quiz. In short, I have no sympathy whatever for students who
cannot get to my class in a timely fashion.**

**How To Survive History 557.03:  
A Guide for Undergraduates**

**Introduction**

History 557.03 is an upper division course taught at an advanced level. It is
also an elective. I therefore assume that students have chosen to take it
because they are interested and motivated to learn the material. I also assume
that students have an appropriate background in American history, which is why
I strongly encourage you to have at least taken History 151 (American
Civilization to 1877) before attempting this course.

The course requires about 200 pages of reading per weekÂ—sometimes more, seldom
less. If you accept this reality at the outset you will be all right. If you
assume you can pick up everything from lecture or from a light skimming of the
texts you will not do well. It's as simple as that. But don't assume that you
can blow off the lectures, either. For one thing, paying attention to the
lectures will help keep you on track, so that you don't overemphasize some
issues while ignoring others. For another, good attendance helps generate a
certain good will between instructor and student, because it more or less
demonstrates that the student is trying. That good will can come in handy if
you fall down on the mid-term and need a little extra help. Finally, there is
almost always a strong positive correlation between good attendance and good
course performance. So while lecture attendance is not required, it is
strongly encouraged. Similarly, I encourage you to take full advantage of my
office hours and those of the teaching associates. As a practical matter, you
may wish to visit them in preference to myself, since they will be grading
your examinations.

A NOTE REGARDING _BATTLE CRY OF FREEDOM_ : I selected _Battle Cry of Freedom_
as the main text for the course because it is currently the standard one-
volume work on the Civil War. Don't be daunted by its length. For one thing,
the book is a pleasure to read. For another, much of it is composed of
extended accounts of military operations. In most cases, these can be skimmed.

However, if you feel yourself absolutely unable to handle a book of this
length, you may substitute Brooks D. Simpson, _America's Civil War_ (Harlan
Davidson, 1996). This book contains only 219 pages of text and covers most of
the same ground as _Battle Cry of Freedom_. It can be ordered from any book
store, though I recommend that you order it from SBX, which always handles
these matters promptly and professionally. When ordering a book, it is helpful
to have the ISBN. In the case of _America's Civil War_ , it is 0-88295-929-8.

A NOTE REGARDING _MOTHERS OF INVENTION_ : I selected this book in order to
give students some exposure to the significance of the Civil War for gender
relations; that is, the roles that men and women chose to play or were
expected to play. The second take-home exam will be based exclusively on
_Mothers of Invention_ , so be sure to read it carefully.

A NOTE REGARDING _A FOOL'S ERRAND_ : This is the thinly-disguised
autobiography of a Northerner who attempted to make a new life for himself in
the postwar South. It contains some of the most vivid illustrations of the
nature and ultimate failure of Reconstruction. I have assigned it in
preference to a regular textbook because from past experience I have learned
that students find textbooks on Reconstruction more confusing than helpful. Be
sure to read it with care. Questions based on _A Fool's Errand_ will figure
prominently on the final exam.

**Quizzes**

I administer quizzes weekly in order to test whether students have done the
assigned reading. The quizzes are not announced in advance. They consist of a
few (typically four) multiple choice and fill-in-the-blank questions. The
questions are drawn from the most important arguments and historical
developments discussed in the readings. If you have absorbed the major points
of the assigned reading, you should do well. If not, not.

You cannot make up a quiz if you miss class or even if you arrive in class
while the quiz is underway. Your lowest quiz grade will be dropped, which
means that you can miss one quiz without penalty. Each additional missed quiz
will result in a zero for that quiz. BE SURE YOU UNDERSTAND THIS!

**Take Home Examinations**

On Thursday of the quarter's fourth week and again during the sixth week, you
will receive a take-home exam that requires you to write a 5-page essay on one
out of three possible questions. (The exam questions will also be posted on
the Web.) The essay should be typed, double-spaced, free of misspellings or
grammatical faults. The essay is due in class the following Tuesday. NO LATE
PAPERS WILL BE ACCEPTED barring a serious emergency. **_Computer or printer
problems do not constitute an emergency and will not be accepted as a
legitimate excuse._**

2\. Essay

On Thursday of the quarter's fourth week you will receive a take-home exam
that will require you to write a 5-page essay on one out of three possible
questions. (The exam questions will also be posted on the Web.) The essay
should be typed, double-spaced, free of misspellings or grammatical faults,
and consistent with the guidelines set forth in Strunk and White's Elements of
Style. The essay is due in class the following Tuesday. NO LATE PAPERS WILL BE
ACCEPTED barring a serious emergency. Computer or printer problems do not
constitute an emergency and will not be accepted as a legitimate excuse.

An essay exam is mainly concerned with the student's grasp of the overarching
concepts of the course and how these concepts organize and give meaning to the
historical facts. Students frequently assume that the essay is just another
way for them to demonstrate what they know about the material that has been
presented in class. In fact, an essay principally tests your ability to think
analytically and to explain your analysis on paper. This involves, in turn:

a. an ability to write clearly, so that the reader is not baffled by
misspellings, grammatical faults, run-on sentences, etc.;

b. an ability to articulate a thesis; in other words, to assert a point of
view concerning the question being discussed;

c. an ability to prioritize. What issues are most important in answering the
question? What is the most logical order in which to present them? What
examples most clearly illustrate these critical issues?

d. an ability to avoid the irrelevant: everything you write should relate
directly and explicitly to the question posed;

e. an ability to write an essay that is proportional to the length allowed. If
asked to write a 5-page essay, you must tailor your depth of coverage so that
you cover the whole question in 5 pages, without omitting important points or
overemphasizing one point to the detriment of another.

**Final Examination**

The final examination will be partly a take-home examination and partly held
in class. The question for the take-home portion will be handed out on the
last day of class and will address only material covered since the seventh
week of the course. It is due at the beginning of the in-class final
examination hour. The in-class portion of the examination will be an objective
(i.e., multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, matching, etc.) test covering the
entire course.

**Course Description**  
This course is an introduction to the theories, histories, and narratives of
Atlantic spaces, using the trope of travel.  Here, travel is studied in a
variety of forms -- free, forced, for various purposes -- that always result
in transformations.  We will examine how travel has transformed the Atlantic
as a fluid space of economic, cultural, and political exchanges.

We begin with the imaginary Atlantic and the invention of land and peoples
within medieval European belief systems, complemented by critical readings on
maps and exploration.  Our journey then takes us to the initial encounters of
Portuguese voyager Gomes Eannes de Azurara in Guinea and the formation of the
imperial discourse of Atlantic space.  We analyze the Columbus letter
alongside contemporary critical texts with particular view to theories of
encounters and exchanges in general.  The class then turns to Walter Ralegh's
(Raleigh) text on the discovery of Guiana accompanied by critical readings on
gold, gender, and the discourse of empire.  From there, we visit Shakespeare's
_Tempest_ and its critical travels, along with Caribbean re-imaginings of the
play.   Our next unit analyzes Montaigne's essay on cannibalism and Jean de
Lery's narrative of his voyage to Brazil.  These texts are further studied
through Michel de Certeau's writings on historiography.  We contrast this view
of the Enlightenment with narratives of contemporary enslaved Africans.  This
unit is followed by Paul Gilroy's theoretical text on the Black Atlantic read
in the context of excerpts of African-Atlantic travel narratives.  We then
examine the development and persistence of African cultural expressions in
Brazil.  Our next session studies the impact of Alexander von Humboldt's
travels and writings on the "re-invention of the Americas." We then turn to
women voyagers to Latin America and Africa and their participation in the
discourses of empire and nation.  Our final session is devoted to oral
presentations of their student research for papers.

Theories of Atlantic Cultures is an introduction to a signifying metaphor that
has resonance well beyond the texts studied in the class.  As a first view of
an emerging field of study, students will have the opportunity to participate
in shaping a theoretical language to describe the imaginings, narratives, and
cultural exchanges through Atlantic spaces.  As an introductory course, we do
not reach the twentieth century per se, but rather study texts that are
essential to an understanding of more contemporary works.  The creation of an
imaginary Atlantic continues; this course is about some of the major issues
that shape its beginnings.

All class lectures, discussions, and assigned readings are in English since
this is a cross-listed seminar.  Students may read primary material in the
original.  Papers and other written assignments may also be completed in
English, Spanish, French or Portuguese.

**Requirements**  
Students should complete all readings for the session listed in the syllabus.
Individual students will be assigned specific texts for the week to prepare
short  presentations.  There will be take home mid-term questions and a final
paper (15 pages).  The paper topic is decided in consultation with the
professor.  Students are asked to complete research and writing for the paper
in various stages B abstract, bibliography, prospectus, oral presentation,
final paper.  After the final paper is turned in, students will meet with the
professor to discuss comments, etc.

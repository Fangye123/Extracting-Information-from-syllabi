_Student Atlas of World Geography_ , 2nd edition, John L. Allen, 2001---should
run you about $10-$15.  What a bargain.

**_Objectives_**

The main objective of the course is to broaden and strengthen the individual's
interest in the world at large; to consider how/where/why physical and
cultural forces shape and define the earth we live on. Geography 1014 is a
world regional survey designed to acquaint undergraduate students with a
variety of geographic, historic, environmental, demographic, religious and
economic characteristics of various areas of the world. The world is a big
place, filled with trillions of facts and figures, billions of people,
hundreds of thousands of places, and lifetimes of experience: we can only
cover so much. Readings, lectures, slides, and films will be employed to
promote interest and highlight geographic themes, but are not intended as
exhaustive regional surveys.

**_Requirements_**

\--Grades will consist of three exams (worth 25%, 25%, 25% respectively; 75%
total), and the remainder (25%) based on movie review assignments..

\--MOVIE REVIEW ASSIGNMENTS: Each week a movie will be shown in McBryde 100\.
Click on the **[MOVIES](MOVIES/main.htm)** button on the main web page to take
you to a list of the regions we will view movies from, and the movie selected
from that region. Each movie title button will then take you to a description
of the movie, questions to be addressed in your review, and several internet
links related to the film.   You DO NOT have to attend ALL of the films--
select five movies that interest you the most and come and watch them.  We
will even have guest speakers for many of the films who specialize in the
region that the film is from, available for questions and clarifications about
the film's content.   I highly recommend taking notes during your viewing.
Then you will type up a 2.5 to 3 page 'review' which will be turned in during
the Tuesday class period following the film viewing.

I will discuss the format of this review in class, and you can click here to
refer to the **[FORMAT](MOVIES/format.htm)** list. You are required to do five
of these exercises during the course of the 14 week semester.   HOWEVER,
whatever movie we have watched for the week will be due the following Tuesday
--at which time you are allowed to turn in ONLY THAT REVIEW; meaning you
cannot wait until the last due date to turn in several, or all five, at the
last minute.  This policy is strictly regulated and enforced. If you are not
able to attend the weekly viewing of the films, I will have them on reserve at
Newman Library in the Center for Alternative Media (CAM).

**NO HANDWRITTEN, NO E-MAILED FILES, AND NO LATE WORK ACCEPTED.   EVER.**

**_ADDITIONAL NOTICES_**

CONCERNING MISSING EXAMS:  
(1) If you cannot take the exam due to personal emergency, the instructor must
be notified before the examination in person or message left with the
Geography departmental secretary (231-6886). Messages by email or messages
left on an answering machine do not constitute prior notification.

(2) Credible proof of the personal emergency in the form of a doctor's note or
a letter from the Dean of Students must be demonstrated.

These criteria will be strictly enforced. Only in such cases will a make-up
examination be granted. If neither or only one of these conditions is met,
students shall receive zero points. ALL MAKE-UP EXAMS WILL BE ESSAY FORMAT. NO
EXCEPTIONS.   **My advice:** Unless showing up for the exam will result in a
painful death, I would not miss it.

CONCERNING MOVIE REVIEWS:  
The University Honor system is in operation throughout this course. This
applies especially to the individual component of your grade performed outside
of class. ALL WORK DONE OUTSIDE OF CLASS IS TO BE CONDUCTED INDEPENDENTLY!!!
Any 'sharing' of movie reviews or extensive 'borrowing' from the web will be
considered a serious violation of the University Honors system, and will be
dealt with judiciously.

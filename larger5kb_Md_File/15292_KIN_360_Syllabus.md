    _Coaching Demonstration_ : 

    Each student is required to conduct a coaching demonstration lasting between 8-10 minutes.  The   
    demonstration should be performed as if you were actually in practice with your own sport team.  You   
    choose the sport and the skill/drill to be demonstrated.  You will have a full-court gymnasium space in   
    which to conduct your demonstration.  Thus, your sport must be one that can be demonstrated on the   
    court (although you can pretend it is a football/ softball field, golf range, etc. - swimming would not be   
    appropriate).  You must use the students in the course to "practice" the skill _after_ you have thoroughly   
    demonstrated it.  This will allow me to grade you on the feedback you provide to your "players".   
    Please note that you will be graded according to the principles of effective demonstrations reviewed   
    in class - **not** on the actual content of the demonstration.   There are positively **no makeups** should   
    you miss class on the day you signed up to perform your demonstration.  Immediately prior to your   
    scheduled demonstration, you are to hand in a typewritten "Practice Plan" which includes the following: 

    1\. Title page   
        a) Skill to be demonstrated   
        b) Intended audience (age, sex, level of expertise, number, etc.)   
        c) Your name   
        d) Date   
    2\. Objectives   
        a) Physical   
        b) Psychosocial   
    3\. Justification (i.e., what are the benefits of learning this skill?)   
    4\. Equipment list   
    **5\. Outline of key elements of movement including verbal and visual cues to be utilized**   
    6\. Attention/motivation strategies   
    7\. Miscellaneous (pictures, drawing, etc.)

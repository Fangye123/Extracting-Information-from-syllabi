##  Who Are You?

* **Your Status**   
The College of St. Scholastica Library exists to serve all CSS students,
whether on-campus or not. We are the only library which is dedicated to
serving the information needs for your academic program. While libraries in
your home area may have resources which can assist you from time to time, we
can and will serve all the needs of our students.

**The first step** is to be a _registered student_ at CSS. You will do this
through your department or program, through Admissions, or through the
Registrar. This information is automatically transferred to the Library's user
information system. A registered student is considered "active" in our system.
All students become "inactive" at the end of each semester unless enrolled for
the subsequent semester.

*Be on time: when students register during the normal advisement and registration schedule (usually, four weeks before the end of the current semester), they remain activated automatically.

*If you register late, you may need to contact the Library directly in order for us to renew your active status.

*If you are not formally enrolled for courses during a semester but need library services for your program, you will need to contact the Library directly in order to remain activated.

**The second step** is to have a _CSS ID_. Even off- campus students need an
ID. Your department will arrange to issue CSS IDs. On the ID is a bar code: it
always begins with 20116 with 9 more digits.

*The major library system used at CSS and accessible off-campus is PALS. To use PALS, you need an ID/bar code number and a _password_. Your _password_ is your _last name_.   
Example: bar code: 20116000099999  
password: smith

**The third step** : _Before you use the Library (on or off- campus) for **the
first time**_ we must create a _link_ between your registration information
(using your social security number) and your bar-code. Either you or your
department will need to furnish the Library with your name, social security
number, and CSS ID barcode number.

**Your Program**  
The College supports several different off-campus programs. Each program has
different requirements, different schedules, and different funding
arrangements.

Many of the services the Library provides are the same for all students.

However, for _special cost_ services such as photocopying articles or mailing
books, you will need to indicate which program you are in: some programs have
special fees, others have access to special grant funds. Also, when you have
_reference questions_ it is often useful to know what program you are in so as
to provide more specific answers. When you contact the Library it will be
easiest always to _identify your program_ : for example, "Brainerd Nurse
Practitioner Program"  

* * *

  
What Can We Do For You?  
A library can do two things for you.

*We can help you **identify** resources that address your needs. Some basic guidance on this is given below, for books, articles, and "documents." If you have any other questions, we will provide _reference_ services to help you. See below on "Contacting the Library."

*We can **deliver to you** the resources you need. Some items are available full text through PALS (meaning you can print the entire article on the printer attached to your home computer), others will need to be requested.

##  The ROVER Service

##  The **Rover** service "fetches" books and copies of articles for you.

(Notice:  Requests for photocopies must comply with U.S. Copyright Law.
[(legal notice))](http://www.css.edu/library/requestingphotocopies.html)

_First, **identify** exactly what you need_ :

For books: author, title, publisher, place of publication, publication date,
edition if specified.  
Example: Ahronheim, J.C., Moreno, J., and Zuckerman, C. _Ethics in clinical
practice_ Boston: Little, Brown, 1994

For articles: full periodical (journal or magazine) title, volume,
number/issue, date, page(s); author(s) and brief article title.  
Example: Wong, Donna. "Using local anesthetics to control procedural pain."
_American Journal of Nursing_ Jan 1997, vol. 97, no. 1, p17.

_Second, **send** your request to the Library_

E-mail is easiest:  library@css.edu.  Also see below, [How do you contact
us?](contact)

Include _full information_ about yourself: name, CSS bar-code, program,
address

Example:  
Jane Smith  
20116000012345, Brainerd Nursing  
1002 Pitcairn Lane  
Crosby, MN 55555

* **CAREFUL** When on PALS (see below), you can use the "Interlibrary Loan" button.   If you do, **be sure to include a note (Optional Notes), ROVER PATRON**. If you do not, we will not know that you are an off-campus student, and when the book arrives, it will sit on our shelves waiting for you to visit and pick it up.  E-mail to the Library is easiest and best.

_Third, **receive** and use your materials_  
Photocopies will be yours to keep.  
Books _from the CSS Library_ are due at the _end of the current academic
semester_ (for graduate students; for undergraduates it is 4 weeks) unless
other arrangements are made. You must mail them back (first class or UPS) to
CSS by this date.  
We can _recall_ a CSS book from you: if you have had it for more than four
weeks and another patron needs to use it, or at any time, if a faculty member
needs it for a class. If you receive a _recall notice_ in the mail, you will
need to mail the book back immediately.

Books borrowed through Rover but from _other libraries_ (through the MINITEX
Interlibrary Loan system), have their own due dates. _They must be returned
quickly_ and renewals are usually not available. Please be sure to use these
books right away.

**Note: Rover is for items you yourself identify. Some courses have materials
listed in a bibliography in the class syllabus, and often copies of these
items can be obtained **directly** from your professor or your program or
department coordinator.

How Do You Contact Us?  
Fo **r** Rover the easiest method is **e-mail** :  
library@css.edu  
or by fax,  
1-218-723-5948

By **phone** use:  
1-800-447-5444

Ask the Campus Operator for the Library, then when the Library phone is
answered ask for either the **Rover** service (you need specific items) or
**reference librarian** (you need advice on identifying items, or have other
questions).

We are also happy to call you back at a time of your convenience.

Our **mailing** address is:  
Library  
College of St. Scholastica  
1200 Kenwood Avenue  
Duluth, MN 55811

##  Who Are We?

At the Library, all the personnel work together so that all patrons receive
the services they need as quickly as possible. Unless you are in the middle of
a series of questions with a particular person, you do not need to wait for
"Rachel" or "Todd" to be available; someone else can usually help you: ask for
the "reference librarian" or "Rover."

But we have names:

_Librarians_ : all of these people can answer _reference_ questions  
*Rachel Applegate, Director of the Library   
(218) 723-6143  
*Todd White, Reference Librarian   
723-6473  
*Kevin McGrew, Periodicals/ILL Librarian   
723-6198

_Staff Personnel_ : these people, plus the librarians, can assist you with
Rover or other questions  
*Karen Ostovich, Circulation Supervisor (evenings, weekends), Rover Coordinator   
723-6140  
*Julie Soule, Circulation Supervisor (mornings)   
*Barb Werner ILL Clerk   
723-6178  
Many student workers, and our other non-public service staff personnel, also
help make the library run.

##  At a Local Library

What to expect from a local academic library:

What libraries are available?  
The CSS Library (as well as others) has a reference source: _American Library
Directory_. Using this we can tell you the closest academic libraries, how
large they are and what special collections they might have. This includes
medical schools and other specialized health science libraries.

Can I use their collections?  
Almost all academic libraries are open to the general public to use their
materials within the library, and all will have photocopy machines.

Can I check materials out?  
*In most libraries, some materials cannot be checked out at all: reference books, magazines and journals (for almost all libraries), and audiovisual materials (for nearly all non- student users).

*If the library is a PALS member, you will be able to use your normal CSS ID to check materials out. Due-dates, fines and other limits are those of that institution, not CSS.

As of 2001, PALS included all Minnesota State Colleges and Universities
(MnSCU) institutions (state universities, community colleges and technical
colleges), as well as St. John's University, the College of St. Benedict, the
University of Minnesota-Crookston, Concordia-Moorhead, North Dakota State
University (Fargo), Bethany Lutheran College, Gustavus Adolphus, and St.
Mary's University.

This unfortunately does not include the University of Minnesota and its
Biomedical Library, the University of Minnesota Duluth, or the library of the
Mayo Clinic.

*If the library is not a PALS member, you may ask their Circulation Department for non-student borrowing privileges. This is controlled only by that institution and may include fees and restrictions.

Can I use their indexes?  
*In all libraries you will be able to use their _printed indexes_.   
*In PALS libraries, you will be able to use the _PALS online catalog and periodical index files_ from terminals in their libraries.   
*Some libraries have indexes in _CD-ROM format_ ; they are usually available at PC workstations dedicated to that purpose. Normally, you will be able to use CD- ROM indexes, but you should be sure to defer to their own student users if the workstation is busy.   
*Some libraries have _computerized indexes_ available through their online catalog system (similar to the files on PALS). From a terminal in their library, you may be able to use these indexes. However, if the system requires a password, you will not be able to use them.

Can I use their computers?  
Most colleges organize their personal computers with a network which requires
password access. Only their own students will be issued active passwords.

Can I use their interlibrary loan /MINITEX service?  
If you want an item which is not in that library, you must use the **Rover**
system to request the book or article. Only students, faculty and staff of a
particular college can use that institution's interlibrary loan system. There
are two reasons for this: first, interlibrary lending involves significant
costs, and each institution (including CSS) budgets to address the needs of
its own students. Second, federal copyright law imposes certain per-
institution restrictions on borrowing, and these restrictions should benefit
their own students.

What to expect from a local public library:

Are public libraries and academic libraries the same?  
No. Every library is unique, reflecting the needs of the community it serves.
An academic library has a responsibility of supporting the curriculum offered
by its school. A public library has a responsibility to the needs of the local
community (which provides the tax base to support the library). Every
community is unique. Public libraries in larger cities, such as Minneapolis,
obviously have more resources than a smaller public library, such the Hibbing
Public Library. As a rule of thumb, it is reasonable to say that scholarly
journals and medical information aimed at health professionals will not be
found in a public library. However, they may be a good place to explore what
health information is available to consumers; many public libraries pride
themselves on being resources for their public patrons.

What libraries are available?  
The CSS Library (as well as others) has a reference source: _American Library
Directory_. Using this we can tell you the closest public libraries, how large
they are and what special collections they might have.

Can I use their collections?  
Yes. All materials are available for your use _within_ the library. All public
libraries should have photocopy machines.

Can I check materials out?  
*In most libraries, some materials cannot be checked out at all: reference books, current magazines, and journals. However, each library sets its own policies.   
*As a resident of your community you should be able to apply for a library card free of charge. Your local library may also be part of a larger 'system' and you may have borrowing privileges within the system. For example, residents of Grand Marais, one hundred plus miles north of Duluth, can use their Arrowhead Library System Card to check out books from Duluth Public Library. However, if they do, they must return the books to the Duluth Public Library by their due date and not to their local library (if they had requested that same book through interlibrary loan at Grand Marais Public Library, they could then return them to Grand Marais, and not Duluth). On the other hand, residents of Superior, Wisconsin, 1/2 mile away from Duluth, cannot check out books from the Duluth Public Library without paying a $35-a-year special borrowing privilege fee. Please check with your local public library as to what borrowing privileges you have.

Can I use their indexes?  
*In all libraries you will be able to use their printed indexes.   
*Some libraries have indexes in CD-ROM format: they are usually available at PC workstations dedicated to that purpose. Normally, you should be able to use CD-ROM indexes.

Can I use their computers?  
Yes, if the library has computers available for the public and dependent on
individual library policies. Often libraries cannot supply the staff to teach
patrons individually how to use a computer. Computers may be available, then,
but with no assistance provided in using them. If you are unfamiliar with
using computers, check with your local Community Education programs for
possible introductory classes.

Can I use their interlibrary loan / MINITEX service?  
Yes, if you have borrowing privileges at that library. However, CSS, as your
academic library, offers you ROVER for your interlibrary loan needs. CSS
should be able to process your request just as fast, if not faster, than a
public library, and deliver the articles to your home. (please take into
consideration a lag time for mailing materials). PALS is currently offering an
increasing number of full text articles available for you to print out from
your home computer. For more information see the [Articles](articles) section.  


What to expect from a local special library

What is a special library?  
In general, a special library is simply not an academic or public library: it
serves a very specialized audience. Hospitals and very large clinics, schools
and school districts, private companies such as utilities or manufacturers,
and research institutes, all may operate small, specialized libraries..  
**Focus: Health Special Libraries**

What libraries may be available to nurses?  
Many larger hospitals (150 beds and up) have libraries. Health science
librarianship is a recognized specialty and many hospital librarians have
great experience and expertise. Many times these libraries have become used to
filling doctors' requests for information supporting patient care or research,
but there is a growing understanding that nurses and other professionals can
also receive benefits from professional literature.

What are the advantages of using a special library?  
An important resource will be that library's personnel, a health sciences
librarian or information specialist. That person is likely to have knowledge
about resources that are immediately applicable to your professional needs. He
or she will be familiar with your working environment, and may be able to
connect you with other nurses or people with similar interests.

The special library exists to serve your work-related needs. It may have
computer workstations, internet access, and book and periodical collections
that you can use without charge and which are tailored to medical personnel.

What are the disadvantages of using a special library?  
First, many special libraries work with extremely limited, and sometimes
undependable, budgets. (You can help remedy this by making sure administrators
understand the value of the library, or its potential value if it were
adequately funded. Invisibility often leads to under-funding). When money is
available, it may be targeted at resources that do not meet your own needs.

Second, many hospital libraries may not be able to participate in local, state
or national **free** interlibrary lending arrangements. This would be
particularly true of for- profit institutions. In this case, obtaining copies
of articles from journals not owned by the hospital would involve a
significant expense (a typical charge is $10.00) to the library or to the
patron. In addition, hospital libraries may not be able to handle the volume
of requests that a nurse taking coursework would generate. The rhythms, and
demands, of academic work are different from those of a special library.

Please feel free to work with your local health services librarian, but the
College of St. Scholastica Library is fully ready to serve your needs. Contact
us directly, or encourage your local librarian to contact us if he or she has
any questions or concerns.

In general, the more your own research questions fall directly into the
mission of your special library, the more likely it is that it will be able to
assist you. If for CSS classes you wish to explore more wide-ranging topics,
it will often be speedier and more efficient for you to use the Rover service
through the CSS Library to meet your needs.  

* * *

##  What Do You Want?

Books  
**Locating Books on a topic:**

In order to find books on a topic, you need to work with three concepts and
categories: the **catalog** of books (how books are described in either an
automated or paper-based system), the **subject terms** used to describe the
contents of books, and the different **systems and commands** used to actually
locate good citations to books.

**The Catalog**

All American academic libraries, most larger public libraries, and many
special libraries, use the same format and rules for describing books (called
"MARC"). This means that roughly the same information is available about each
book:

*Author or authors (including "corporate" authors if a group such as the Minnesota Board of Nursing produces a book or report), as well as editors or compilers.   
*Title of the book as a whole.   
*Publisher information: place of publication, publisher, date, and edition.   
*A description: how many pages, how tall, whether there is a bibliography or notes or pictures.   
*Contents: for newer books, and for larger libraries, contents may be listed: the short stories in a collection, or individual chapters in a book with only a general editor.   
*Subject: _see below:The Subject Terms_.

This information means that in most computerized systems you can search for a
book by author or editor, and sometimes--but not always--by individual chapter
information. Publisher and size information is rarely searchable.

_When you hear that a library "is on the Internet" or "is on the Web," this
usually means that its **catalog** is accessible through the Internet. You can
find descriptions of books, but not the books themselves._

Note: What is a "book"?

Think broadly. A "book" is nearly anything that is not an audiovisual item, or
a journal or magazine article. Many government reports, and pamphlets such as
those published by the National League for Nursing, are considered "books,"
are listed in library catalogs, and can be searched for and retrieved by
patrons.

**The Subject Terms**

There is one specific list of "authorized" terms used to describe subjects in
academic and public libraries in the United States. This list is maintained by
the Library of Congress and is called the _Library of Congress Subject
Headings_ (LCSH).

The purpose of such a **controlled vocabulary** list is to **group together**
all books on a topic no matter what words the authors have used in the titles
of the books. Thus, all of these books:  
_The case for consultation in nursing_  
_Entrepreneuring : a nurse's guide to starting..._  
_The nurse as an individual, group, or community_  
_Peer consultation in a group context : a guide_

have the authorized term: **Nursing consultants** as part of their catalog
description.

It is much easier to search using the correct authorized subject term for your
topic than to guess what each author has titled his or her book.  
  
To **find** the correct subject heading--one way:

_Step one_ : Try to **find** at least one book on your topic; you may know a
specific book already, or you can look for a book with the "term" or "keyword"
or "title" word with your topic. For example, even though "patient
communication" is not an authorized (correct) subject term, the words are
likely to be in the title of at least one book on that topic.  
Search: title term search: patient communication  
Find: _Nurse-patient communication_

_Step two_ : **Look** at the subject terms attached to that book.  
See: Communication in nursing

_Step three_ : **Use** that subject term in a specific subject search.  
Use: Communication in nursing  
Find: In CSS Library, 14 books, including:  
_Talking points_ and  
_The helping interview_

These books do not have "patient communication" in their title, but are about
this topic. If you _only_ do a keyword search, you will not find them.  
Keep **repeating** these steps. Most books have more than one subject term
describing them; every time you see a new one, consider whether it is a topic
you are interested in, and try using it in a search.

You can also try these methods:  
*Some libraries have printed copies of the LCSH available: they are very large books, and are usually in red volumes.   
*When using the PALS system ( _see below_ ) there is a specific LCS file available for searching. Try doing a "term" search for your topic in it.   
*In some systems you may be able to "browse" or view a list of subjects used in that library. This list may include notes such as "Death Penalty: See Capital Punishment."   
*Call the CSS Reference Desk. We can give advice about subject term selection.

_Important:_  
*Many medical libraries use a **different** list called _MeSH_ or "Medical Subject Headings," maintained by the National Library of Medicine. These terms are usually both more specific and more technical than those in LCSH: LCSH uses "Brain--Cancer" while MeSH uses "Brain Neoplasms."

_LCSH should only be used when looking for books_  
*Systems for **citations to articles** from journals or magazines (periodical indexes) _use different terminology_ ; for medical topics, this is often (but not always) MeSH. ( _see theArticles section below_ )

**The Systems and Commands**

Fifty years ago all libraries had the same kind of catalog (a card catalog),
following the same searching rules--but no one could search a library without
standing in front of the actual catalog.  
With computerization, many (most academic and many public) libraries can be
searched through the Internet, but these libraries often use different
automation systems, so different search commands are needed for different
libraries.

_The College of St. Scholastica belongs to the **PALS** system_

Within Minnesota, there are currently (2001) twomain automation systems (and
many smaller ones):

**The [MnLINK](http://www.mnlink.org/) Gateway, which provides a common
interface to access most public libraries, and all academic libraries, within
Minnesota.  
** _[PALS](http://www.pals.msus.edu/webpals/), which is the **P** roject for
**A** utomated **L** ibrary **S** ystems_ includes all MnSCU institutions:

*all state universities: Bemidji, Mankato, Southwest State, etc.   
*all community and technical colleges: Vermilion, Hibbing, Fond du Lac, etc.   
*all state agencies: the Legislative Reference Library, the Dept. of Health, etc.   
*many important separate libraries: the Minnesota Historical Society, the Hill Reference Library, etc.   
*many private colleges: CSS, Concordia-Moorhead, St. John's, St. Mary's, etc.

Using PALS  
Access PALS through the Web:  
*direct address:[ www.pals.msus.edu](http://www.pals.msus.edu/)   
or, *go to the CSS Home Page, to On Campus Now, then in the upper right corner
click on Library, then see PALS.

On the PALS Home Page:  
*Choose: Search PALS   
*If you wish to search non-PALS libraries, click on "Link to Other Internet Resources."

On the PALS Select Library and Resource screen:  
*The _Resource_ for books is:  The Library Catalog   
*The _Library_ : click on the arrow to display the list. If you want anything on a topic, go to the top and choose "all PALS libraries." The results you get will indicate if CSS owns an item. If we do not, we can borrow it from another library (see the Rover service information above). If you are going to visit a particular library, you can select it from the list to see if it has a particular book or topic.

On the Search the Library Catalog screen you can choose to search by:

Title, exact (omit initial article)  
Title, Keyword  
Author (last-name, first-name)  
Subject Heading, keyword  
Subject Heading, exact  
Keyword

If you are looking for a _specific book_ , choose the **Author** or **Title**
searches. With **Title, exact** you must give the entire correct title, e.g.
_Gone with the Wind_. With **Title, keyword** you can put in one or more words
from the title, in any order, e.g. _wind gone_.

To look for any books on a _topic_ :  
*if you know the correct LCSH subject heading, choose **Subject Heading, keyword** , or **Subject Heading, exact**. With the latter, you need to have the terms in the subject heading exactly right: _Brain Cancer_ , not _cancer and brain_

*if you do not know the correct LCSH subject heading, try a **Title, keyword** , or a **Keyword search** on your topic. Look at the subject lines of a book on the topic, then either click that term directly, or return to the search screen and do a search with it.

Saving your results:  
*If you have a group of good citations to books on your topic, you can click on the **print to e-mail** button; the list will be e-mailed to the address you supply.   
*You can also use your browser's copy-and-paste function to put individual citations into a wordprocessing document: use your cursor to highlight the information you need.   
*IF YOU USE the **Patron Interlibrary Loan** button, be sure to put the word ROVER in the Notes box.   
If you use this, the book will be sent to the CSS Library. If you do not
indicate ROVER, we will not know that you are an off-campus student, and it
will sit on our shelves waiting for you to visit and pick it up.  
USE THE ROVER SERVICE. Use copy-and-paste to gather good citations, then
e-mail these requests to library@css.edu along with your own personal
idenfication. With this method, we best can retrieve, keep track of, and mail
the books you need.

###  Articles

To find articles from magazines and journals, one needs an appropriate index.
Each index has its own scope (what periodicals it includes) and arrangement
(what subject terms it uses). There are **three main medical indexes.**

**CINAHL**  
The _[Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health
Literature](http://www.css.edu/depts/library/Proxytest.html)_ is the premier
resource in its field.  
If you are accessing CINAHL from off-campus, you must use our "proxy server."
Databases such as CINAHL require libraries to pay large licensing fees, and
you need to be identified as one of our students. Instructions on setting up
proxy access can be found at the [proxy
databases](http://www.css.edu/depts/library/OFFCAMPU/settingupproxy.htm) page.  
Once you are into the Ovid CINAHL system, use the options and controls listed
at the top and **bottom** of the screen. Normally, you will _search_ , perhaps
_limit_ your results, and then _view_ them.  
To save good citations **do not** use the **print** option. Instead, select
**Save**. Follow the instructions and supply your e-mail address; your
citations will be "mailed" to you.

_Advantages_  
First, CINAHL has **very wide scope**. It covers **all** nursing journals,
even very specialized and foreign titles. It also covers nearly all physical
therapy and occupational therapy journals. Especially in recent years, it also
includes many nursing-related articles from more "medical" journals such as
the _Archives of Internal Medicine_. It extends more than twenty years into
the past.  
Second, CINAHL is of **very high quality**. It uses its own list of authorized
terms; the medical terms are the same as MeSH, and it adds a wide range of
nursing- specific concerns. Categorization of articles by topic, format
(research? clinical? survey?) and aspects (human? elderly) is thorough and
reliable. The Ovid computerized search system allows easy searching for
related (broader and narrower) topics.  
CINAHL is so comprehensive that a nurse who does a thorough search in it needs
no other resource for nursing information. The only reason to use another
index is to obtain non-nursing material: for example, articles on depression
written for psychologists, or for the lay public.

_Disadvantages_  
First, for most journals, CINAHL only has citations to articles. To obtain
copies of the articles themselves, you will need to visit a library or use the
Rover service. (the "Nursing Collection" includes only 20 journals whose full-
text articles are available.)  
Second, CINAHL is, in a sense, too comprehensive. It is sometimes not possible
to obtain copies of articles from smaller foreign journals (no one in
Minnesota may own the periodical), or to borrow some pamphlets, dissertations
and other odd material indexed in CINAHL.

**Medline**  
The National Library of Medicine produces a very large index of citations
(database): (printed) Index Medicus, (computerized) Medline, Grateful Med,
PubMed. (All of these names refer to the same database).  
Because this is a taxpayer-supported, government-produced database, it is
available through several different mechanisms. The main address on the World
Wide Web is:  
[http://www.nlm.nih.gov](http://www.nlm.nih.gov/) (that's "enn ell emm dot enn
eye aych dot gee oh vee")  
On this page, click on "Free Medline" and then choose "PubMed."  
To search for article citations, follow the screen directions.  
Two features will be of special assistance. First, try to use MeSH ("Medical
Subject Headings") terminology for your topic. For example, use "colonic
neoplasms," not "bowel cancer." To find the correct wording, use the "Find
MeSH Term" button.  
Second, consider limiting your search. The search procedure, either the basic
one or if you choose "Advanced Search," can confine your results to those just
involving humans (many studies have rat or mice as subjects), or to various
aspects such as therapy or epidemiology, or to English-language articles.

_Advantages_  
Like CINAHL, Medline has a **very broad scope** and is of a **very high
quality**. _There is no serious medical journal literature which is not
included in Medline_. Medline covers nearly all related disciplines such as
psychology and psychiatry, nursing, physical therapy, occupational therapy and
many others.  
There are approximately 25 journals which have on-line versions and to which
the NIH Medline database will automatically connect in order to show full-text
articles; this number will increase over time.

_Disadvantages_  
Medline can be overwhelming. Try limiting your results to English-language and
human subjects; also consider limiting by date.  
MeSH terminology is designed for medical (physician and clinical researcher)
use. Sometimes it is not as detailed as someone in an allied health profession
would like. For nursing topics, the terminology used in CINAHL is often more
detailed and precise. In addition, MeSH wording is sometimes geared towards
conditions (and then treatments), making it awkward for researchers interested
in a particular treatment (used with several conditions).  
You will still need to obtain copies of journal articles through Rover. Many
Web sites which offer Medline access (such as Healthgate (www.healthgate.com)
and the National Library of Medicine itself) will allow you to order copies of
articles, but there will be substantial fees for this ($15.00 and up). Rover
is free of these charges.

Special Note: "Full Text"  
Most library users would like to see the full text of journal and magazine
articles appear on their screens.  
Most publishers do not want to provide free or very-low-cost copies of
articles in their journals. Actual printing and mailing costs make up only
15-20% of the price of a periodical. Paperless Internet distribution would
thus leave 80-85% of the costs in place.  
Many full-text periodical articles are available through PALS, and CSS pays
for these as a part of PALS. A few have been made available through CINAHL and
Medline. Some are available directly from publishers, particularly
professional organizations.  
Others are available free-of-charge to you via our interlibrary lending system
(copyright law allows a limited amount of sharing between libraries, but it is
not supposed to substitute for one's own subscription).  
Most article services on the Web will charge $5 - $15 in royalty fees which
compensate publishers.

**The Health Index**  
The Health Index is available through PALS  
From the PALS Select Library and Resource page click on the button by the
Health Index choice. (The top of the Select screen will show the "library" as
the "College of St. Scholastica" but this does not matter with this index;
your results are not confined to CSS).  
You will be asked to logon. Your ID is the 16 digit barcode from the back of
your CSS Student ID. Your password is the first 8 letters of your last name.  
The list of results from your search will include the dates, titles, and
authors of the articles. _At this point_ if you click on the  Print to e-mail
button you will receive a bibliography of citations: abstracts, but not the
articles themselves.

When you choose to look at a specific article from this list (click on its
number) you will see its citation and abstract. If there was an asterix (*) by
the article's date on the list, the _full-text_ of the article is available.
At the bottom of the abstract, you will see a button for "View Article," and
here also you can "print" the full-text of the article to e-mail. (caution:
some charts and graphs are omitted. If you need these, use interlibrary loan).  
IF YOU USE the "Request ILL" button, be sure to include ROVER in the Notes
box.  These articles will be sent to CSS Library and unless you indicate
ROVER, they will be placed on our "hold" shelves because we will not know that
we should mail them to you. Use the Roverservice.

_Advantages_ **:**  
Because the Health Index is on PALS, it is very easily accessible, and the
commands used to search it are the same as in other PALS resources.  
If an article is available full-text, it is immediately available, and you do
not need Rover.

_Disadvantages_  
First, the Health Index has a **limited scope**.   It focuses on mainly
"medical" publications, intended for doctors: it includes only a few nursing
journals.  It also has many articles from consumer, not research, publications  
Second, the Health Index has **limited quality**. It sometimes uses MeSH
terms, and sometimes not, and terms are sometimes applied inconsistently.  
There are often **better alternatives** : Medline and Cinahl.

What other computerized periodical index resources would be helpful?

A health professional may have reason to look for subjects outside of "health"
as such. For example:  
in Health Information Administration, computer records and patient privacy  
in Occupational Therapy, regulations concerning workers' compensation  
in Physical Therapy, strengthening patient's muscles after stroke  
in Exercise Science, aspects of cardiac rehabilitation  
in Education, how parents and schools approach sex education/prevention of
STDs.  
PALS includes many databases (resources) which can address these topics. At
present, use the following from the PALS Library and Resources page:  
For articles on business and management, use the Business Magazines.  
For school, education, and children's issues, use ERIC.  
For psychology, economics, social work, and nearly all other social science
and humanties, look under General Magazines. For popular magazines, click
Magazine Index, for scholarly journals, choose Expanded Academic Index.  
Also see our [Online Databases ](../Proxytest.html)page.

##  Facts and Other Information

Journal articles and books are best accessed through the above-described
methods. However, there is a wealth of other information which may be of use
to you: teaching materials, factsheets, guidelines, statistical data,
addresses, etc.  
The Internet can be a means of access for this sort of information. To find
and use this information, however, it is very important that you keep in mind
a few guidelines. Consider the topic "breast cancer." A search of the internet
for this subject will retrieve hundreds of thousands of possibilities.

_What follows gives some examples but is written in general terms. Because Web
and Internet resources change features, content, and addresses so often, it is
more important to have a general understanding of principles than specific
directions. For a listing of specific resources, see our[Health](El-healt.htm)
page in the Library's Gateways to the World Wide Web._

**First: Think: what information are you interested in**?

All information has its purpose; you need to match the purpose of the author
of the information to your own.

*Do you need to know if a particular treatment works?

All reliable medical research is published in medical journals, which are
indexed in Medline. If you define "works" as "has demonstrated safety and
efficacy in clinical trials" search your topic in Medline.

Much information on the Web about particular treatments are likely to be
advocacy (or anti- advocacy) testimonials: an individual or an organization
which believes a particular treatment works (or does not work). Web resources
are very seldom neutral or two-sided.  
*Do you want to know current guidelines? Ask whose guidelines you would trust, then search for that publisher, organization or agency. Examples include the Merck Manual ( [www.merck.com) ](http://www.merck.com)then choose "Publications"), the National Cancer Institute ( [wwwicic.nci.nih.gov](http://wwwicic.nci.nih.gov) ), and the Mayo Clinic ([www.mayohealth.org](http://www.mayohealth.org/home))

*Do you want to know what your patients may have heard?

This is where a general search of the internet will retrieve general
information about what is generally thought, spoken about, or rumored about a
topic. Chat rooms, listservs and discussion groups all provide this
information.  
There are several search engines you can use.  [Yahoo](http://yahoo.com/) is
very good as a directory:  you can "drill down" as detailed as you like.  For
searching,[ Google](http://google.com/) often gives the highest-quality
results, and it does not alter their listing according to payments, as most
other search engines do.

###  **Second: Search: Choose an appropriate searching method**.

Several steps can make this easier:

*When using a **search engine** be sure to combine your terms correctly. A "search operator" is a way of combining terms using AND (both or all words must be present) or OR (either word must be present). In PALS, the default operator is AND: "breast cancer" will retrieve items which have both words.

On many search engines if you choose multiple words, they are combined with an
OR operator. This means "breast cancer" is read as "anything having the word
breast OR the word cancer," thus retrieving cosmetic breast implants, and skin
cancer.

A common way to specify AND is to use a + plus key: +breast +cancer. For each
search

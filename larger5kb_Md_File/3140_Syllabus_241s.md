**The Foreign Policy of Russia and the Successor States**

**Russian Studies 241s, Spring 1998**

  
Since the collapse of the USSR in 1991, dramatic changes have taken place on
the Eurasian continent. Western powers have to contend with an entirely new
geo-political configuration in Central and Eastern Europe. Old paradigms in
foreign policy and the role of international organizations are being radically
reassessed. What, for example, is the role of the UN, NATO and the World Bank
today in relations with the newly created Commonwealth of Independent States?
This course will examine major themes and developments in Soviet Foreign
Policy since WW11, the impact of the collapse of the Cold War, and look at the
foreign policies of the new states which have emerged in Eurasia since 1991.
We will investigate both the domestic and international factors which shape
foreign policy in Russia and the new states, such as ideology, the military,
the economy, leadership struggles, history, the geo-political environment and
the arms race. There will be somewhat of an emphasis on US-Russian relations.  
  
Requirements:  
  
You must read all the required texts, attend classes regularly and hand your
assignments in **on time** (proven sickness is the only excuse). You will make
individual presentations in class on a regular basis. In addition there will
be one mid-term (a take-home book review), a paper (6 pages), a final
examination and some group presentations in the last 4 weeks of the semester.
This will be explained to you in class but briefly, each group \- to be
created among yourselves by the second week of classes - will analyze an
aspect of the foreign policy of one of the new states within the CIS. Themes
could include relations with Russia, or a look at US policy toward the new
states, or an analysis of domestic constraints on the new states' foreign
policy. You will decide as a group and in consultation with me, how you will
present your case study. To help you, we will set up an email connection with
a group of students in the Georgian Foreign Ministry, and you can consult them
on a regular basis about your ideas and questions regarding all three
republics. (You can see the names and email address of your correspondents in
Georgia at the end of this syllabus)  
  
You will be assessed on the basis of attendance, participation, your
presentations and your written work. A book review is due 13th March and a
paper April 20th. You should regularly consult newspapers and journals on
foreign policy as well as the Web. You must keep a file of cuttings which l
will look at periodically. You are STRONGLY encouraged to bring any new
information you find in your reading of contemporary events in Eurasia to the
class for discussion at any time. l will also be showing two feature films.

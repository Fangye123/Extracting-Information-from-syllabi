<http://usinfo.state.gov/usa/infousa/facts/history/toc.htm>  
Sarah Louise Delany, _Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years_

**Course Overview  
** This course is a survey of United States history from 1877 to the present.
The course will explore the growth of the U.S. into an economic and world
power. The course will provide the student with an outline of the contours of
the past 130 years in the United States. It will ask the student to deal with
the political, social, economic, and foreign policy problems to which every
American must respond.

**Objectives  
** As a result of taking this course, the student:

A. Understands that history must be studied in perspective---time, space,
dimension, cause and effect---to be adequately understood.  
B. Becomes familiar with some of the main interpretations of the institutional
development of American civilization.  
C. Develops an understanding of the conflicts and tensions among the various
cultures and institutions of American civilization.  
D. Is aware of the fact that movements and developments of history are always
part of a global situation.  
E. Develops a critical attitude to the developments and institutions of the
modern United States.  
F. Has begun to develop the skill of analyzing historical perspective.

**Attendance  
** Students are responsible for attending all scheduled classes and completing
all course requirements. Seven absences will result in the student's
withdrawal from the course. Since the instructor will present material not
found in the textbook or modules and participation will be an integral portion
of the final grade, regular attendance is expected of all students.

**Setting the Scene  
** Each unit will contain lectures that will provide a context for
understanding the unit material and a review of the important terms and issues
from the unit. In addition, a video(s) for each unit will cover either the
entire history of the unit or focuses upon a specific topic or subject within
that unit. Students will be expected to discuss the points/issues raised in
each video.

**Quizzes  
** Quizzes will be scheduled after every two units. Quizzes will be objective
in nature and will be based on the information from the on-line textbook and
the instructor's lectures. See Semester Calendar for tentative dates of
quizzes.

**Primary Source Modules  
**<http://www.cuw.edu/history/amercivII_modules.htm>

On the CUW History Department website are primary source modules dealing with
specific topics in American history. Each module contains a group of related
documents and specific assignments. Students must complete one of the
assignments for Module #1, then all of the rest of the module assignments. See
the semester calendar for the due dates of each module assignment. All
students should be familiar with each module for purposes of class discussion
on the assigned dates. No late assignments accepted.

**Book critique  
** Each student will be expected to read the Delany sisters' book in its
entirety. Students should write a 3-4 page paper that compares and contrasts
the experiences of the Delanys with the information provided in lectures, on-
line textbook readings, videos and modules. This assignment requires more than
simply a summary of the book. Students must choose specific periods, events,
and issues to compare. Any paper that is simply a summary of the book will not
receive a passing grade.

**Grading Policy  
** The final grade will be determined as follows: module assignments, quizzes,
book critique, and class participation.

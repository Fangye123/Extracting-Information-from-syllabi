**COURSE EVALUATIONS:  
**  
The following assignments will be used to assess the student's academic
standing in SLS 2105. Students must inform the instructor of conflicts prior
to scheduled examinations and project/assignment due dates. Failure to do so
may result in rejection of work submitted late as rescheduling/accepting exams
and/or projects are at the discretion of the instructor.  
  
**Professional Development Portfolio (10%)**  
Development and submission of the Professional Development Portfolio is
expected of each student enrolled in SLS 2105. A preliminary copy is to be
submitted on 11/1/00 with a final document to be submitted on or before
12/6/00. Students successfully submitting acceptable Portfolios on the
assigned dates will receive 10 points.  
  
**Exams (60%)**  
As indicated within the attached Course Content Schedule three (3) exams will
be administered. All exams will consist of short answer/multiple choice style
with all material discussed prior to the scheduled exam date available for
examination purposes. A progressive point value has been assigned each exam
with the first exam (10/4/00) worth 10 points or 10% of the student's final
grade. Subsequent exams are worth 20 points (11/1/00) and 30% (12/13/00).  
  
**Class Participation (10%)**  
Students will be awarded points based on attendance and participation at each
scheduled class meeting.  
  
**Informational Interviews (5%)**  
Students are expected to arrange and conduct two (2) interviews with
professionals within the field of sport and leisure. It is highly recommended
that students attempt to interview one experienced veteran and one newcomer
within the chosen field. A two-page summary of the discussion is to be
submitted for credit to be granted. The following questions are provided for
student's use as icebreakers, however an additional six-(6) questions are to
be drafted by student interviewers.  
(1) How did you get started in the sport/leisure field?  
(2) What do you think are the key skills necessary to make it in this field
today?  
(3) How do you suggest for someone like myself to break into this field?  
(4) What trends do you foresee emerging within this field within the nest 5-10
years?  
  
**Poster Presentation (15%)**  
Working in pairs, students are to compose a poster presentation on a sport
and/or leisure-related topic approved by the course instructors as described
below.

**INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO**

A significant experience within SLS 2105 is initial construction of the
Professional Development Portfolio, a "scrapbook" of information indicative of
the student's professional preparation. To be included in the Portfolio are
logs, records, certifications, citations, and references that accurately
describe the student's professional activities. It is suggested that a three
ring binder be used for the Portfolio with included information organized into
the following sections:  
  
Professional Resume

> Personal Information  
>  Education  
>  Professional Experience  
>  Other Work Experience  
>  Relevant Skills  
>  Professional Memberships  
>  References

Experiential Activity Log

> Volunteer activities  
>  Credited practical experiences (field experiences)  
>  Professional conference attendance

>

> Professional Certifications/Licenses  
>  Coaching  
>  CPR  
>  First Aid  
>  Education: Seminars/workshops  
>  Professional conference attendance

General Letters of Reference

> Direct supervisors  
>  Professors

Professional Projects

> Class projects  
>  Proprietary projects

Academic Records

> Academic advising log  
>  Official transcripts

  
The fundamental purpose of the Professional Development Portfolio is for the
student to possess a single document to be shared with interested parties
(e.g. prospective employers, internship supervisors) that comprehensively but
accurately represents the student's professional growth and ability. It is
anticipated that the Portfolio will be used for academic advising, field
experience placement, job interviews, and personal reflection.

**Instructions for Poster Presentations**

**Abstracts**  
Students should submit one hundred (100) word abstract describing the proposed
presentation by 3/16/02.  
  
**Size**  
Your complete poster should not exceed an area four feet high by eight feet
wide.  
  
**Title & Abstract**  
Prepare a title for the top of your poster space indicating the program number
of your abstract, its title and your name. The lettering should not be less
than 1 inch high. A copy of your abstract (typed in large type) should be
posted in the upper left-hand corner of the poster board.  
  
**Organization**  
Organize the information into conventional patterns recognized by your
discipline. For example for the sciences and social sciences, this might
include sections entitled: Introduction, Methodology, Results, Discussion, and
References. If the presentation is not describing an empirical study, develop
some other group of logical headings.  
  
**Composition**  
This is the visual structure of the poster. It should aid not interfere with
comprehension. The purpose of composition is to make visual ideas flow
smoothly and logically from one to another, to visually subordinate those
things, which are less important, and to draw attention to those things, which
are of greater importance. A poster cannot be "figured out" the night before
the presentation. It is usually presented for several hours, often amid
crowded conditions, and with many other competing presentations. It is
essential that it contain no nonessential visual elements. Edit ruthlessly! A
good composition has a substantial amount of blank space, ideally close to
50%. This space can be used to highlight section breaks. A "full" poster does
not always make its point. It is often too chaotic to follow easily. Use a
scale model to facilitate composition.  
  
**Suggestions for composing material visually**

> 1\. Groups of related information function best if tightly composed with a
clear surround.

>

>> 2\. Long visual lines help organize groups of information:  
>  o align X or Y axes in groups of graphs;  
>  o align edges in groups of photographs;  
>  o align headings and text material.

>

> 3\. Close positioning of an illustration and its text makes a visual unit.  
>  4\. Use photographs to add realism and impact and to give detailed
orientations. Don't choose photos on the basis of availability. That is, don't
use them just because you have them on hand. Bad photos or photos that mess up
your emphasis are worse than no photos at all.  
>  5\. Use simple line drawings and clear diagrams to identify parts in
relation to a whole and/or  
>  to show functional relations. Use tables and charts to allow for quick
comparative analyses of data.

  
**Text  
** The text, hierarchically organized, must integrate with illustrations,
photographs and tables. Use headings and sub-headings extensively. Main
headings carry essential content and should provide a complete "take home"
message. Designed to be read from 6 - 8 feet away, type must be at least 1/2
inch high. Supporting text follows main headings. It should be visible at 3-4
feet, with type approximately 1/4 inch high. Headings should describe each
figure in sufficient detail to support its significance and relationship to
the main headings. Details, also designed to be read at 3-4 feet, should be
subordinated to supporting text by placement, type weight or background color.  
Consider the following:

> 1\. Caps and lower case are easier to read than all caps.  
>  2\. Serif styles (those type faces characterized by cross-strokes at the
ends of most letters - the font used in this hand-out is a serif font called
Times) read more easily than sanserif styles, especially in long passages.  
>  3\. Type in uneven length lines (flush left, ragged right) reads more
easily than justified (even line length) type.  
>  4\. At all costs, avoid thick blocks of unbroken prose. Wherever possible
(but especially in methods and in the conclusions) use lists (either bulleted
or sequential).

**  
Summary**  
A poster with visual clarity can be produced successfully by:

> o Assembling illustrations and text with a scale model layout plan  
>  o Editing text for brevity, hierarchical structure and efficiency  
>  o Introduction: a few brief sentences  
>  o Methods: a list or flow chart (we did this and this and this)  
>  o Results: illustrations, tables, figures or graphs  
>  o Discussion: a list or summary paragraph of conclusions  
>  o Integrating text with illustrations  
>  o Composing in long visual lines and tight groups with adequate negative
(blank) spaces  
>  o Flow of information: vertical or horizontal. Consider numbering panels  
>  o Keeping consistent scale in text and figures  
>  o Making the poster foldable and portable. Consider designing it in
sections or panels.  
>  o Try elevated mounting of components on foam-core board.

  
**Final questions to ask:**

> o Does the poster communicate effectively?  
>  o Is each element tied together by a central focus or theme?  
>  o Does the design and placement of elements attract viewer attention?  
>  o Have you proofread every element a final time?  
>  **

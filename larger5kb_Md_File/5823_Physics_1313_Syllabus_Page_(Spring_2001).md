**Textbook:**  
**_         _**Lillian C. McDermott, **_Physics by Inquiry,_** Volume  I, John
Wiley and Sons, New York, 1996.  ISBN:  0-471-14440-X.  
        Lillian C. McDermott, **_Physics by Inquiry,_** Volume II, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1996.  ISBN:  0-471-14441-X.   
  
**Prerequisites:**

  
        None.  Some students have expressed an opinion that English Composition I would be valuable as a prerequisite due to the emphasis placed upon composition skills.   
  
**Course Description:**

  
**         PHYS 1313 (L, N) Inquiry-based Physics**. Lab 3. Properties of
matter, motion, light and color, electrical circuits and energy conservation.
Recommended for elementary education majors as model course to learn and teach
science.  
  
**Course Structure and Requirements:**

  
This course is essentially a lab course that meets 2 hours each Monday,
Wednesday, and Friday.  Attendance during the class is **mandatory** and
contributes to the student's participation grade.   There will be **_NO
LECTURES_** ; instead, the student is guided through a tightly-structured
inquiry by the text.  The requirements for the course are that the student
**must** take the Midterm and Final Exams, submit a Semester Project,
Participate in the inquiry, and submit weekly Homework assignments for
successful completion of the course.   Portions of three modules of the text
will be covered by the course:  Properties of Matter (Volume I), Astronomy by
Sight (Volume I), and Electric Circuits (Volume II).  
  
**WWW Content:**

  
**The course homepage will be the student's most valuable resource for
information regarding the course**.   All late-breaking course developments
and information will be disseminated via the web for widest and most immediate
availability.  The course pages reside within the Physics Department website
at <http://www.physics.okstate.edu/chasty/spring2001/physics1313-main.html>.
This will be __the method__ of communicating homework assignments, exam dates,
and any special announcements for this course.   **Be aware and visit
regularly**!  
  
**Course Component Weighting:**

  
The student's course grade will be based on _Homework, a Midterm Exam, the
Final Exam, a Semester Project, and Participation,_ weighted as follows:  
Homework |  20%  
---|---  
Midterm Exam |  20%  
Semester Project |  20%  
Participation |  20%  
Final Exam |  20%  
  
**Grading Scale:**

  
The student's final grade in the course will depend upon his or her scores in
each of the 5 equally weighted evaluation areas:  Participation, Homework,
Semester Project, Midterm Examination, and Final Examination.  The Final
Course Grade will be calculated according to a sysem similar to that used in
calculating student GPA scores:  "A" scores are assigned 4 points, "B"'s 3
points, "C"'s 2 points, "D"'s 1 point, and "F"'s zero points.  These scores
are then summed and averaged, with the student's final course score assigned
according to the following table:  **Final Grade Calculations** Average of 5
Course Scores |  Final Course Grade  
---|---  
4.00 - 3.50 |  A  
3.49 - 2.50 |  B  
2.49 - 1.50 |  C  
1.49 - 0.50 |  D  
0.49 - 0.00 |  F  
  
**Homework:**

  
Homework sets will be given weekly, and will typically include 3-5 problems,
one sun-plot and two moon observations.  With the exception of the first
Homework assignment, Homework will be collected on Fridays at the beginning of
class, and returned the following Wednesday at the end of class.  Each
Homework problem will be graded on a letter scale ("A,B,C,D,F").  Individual
problems whose grades are "D" or "F" may be corrected and resubmitted for
regrading to earn a maximum grade of "C".  _Resubmitted problems must be
stapled to the original graded problem, and submitted with the following
homework assignment_ (allowing 2 days for corrections to be made).   Each
Homework problem will be equally weighted, with the sun-plot and two moon
observations counting as one problem each.  At the end of the semester, the
final Homework score will be calculated by the "GPA" method outlined above.  
  
**Exams:**

  
Midterm and Final Exams will be given to assess student performance.
Examinations will be open book, meaning that the student may use the Physics
by Inquiry text(s), his or her own bound laboratory notebook(s) including
recorded data and comments from in-class work, and the student's own Homework
assignments.  The better the student notebook and Homework are done, the more
helpful they are for Examinations.  Examinations will typically consist of
three problems having equally weighted subquestions, and will be allotted the
full class time for solution.  Each problem portion will be assigned a letter
score in the same manner as Homework problems.  The Exam scores will be
calculated using the "GPA" method outlined above.  
  
**Semester Project:**

  
A major Project will be assigned based on class work.  The instructor
anticipates reviewing a draft of the Project and giving comments before the
final draft is prepared.  Details of this Project will be given at the
appropriate time in the Properties of Matter material, **after the Midterm
Examination**.   The Project will be graded according to a published list of
equally weighted criteria, each of which is assigned a letter grade in the
same manner as a Homework problem.  The Project score will be calculated using
the "GPA" method outlined above.  
  
**Participation:**

  
The Participation score for each student will be influenced by many factors,
including but not limited to:  participation in group discussions and
investigations, willingness to work in groups with other students, tardiness
or absence, willingness to offer explanations, willingness to be "incorrect",
and willingness to self-correct erroneous thinking.  Students should see the
Participation page for additional details.  
  
**Course Policies:**

**Attendance:**

         Attendance during the class is **mandatory** and contributes to the student's participation grade.
  
  
**Make-Ups:**

     Missed class periods must be made up during office hours **_within one week of the absence**_.   **Students are expected to make up every class period missed**.   To be eligible to make up the absence, the student must notify the instructor (either in writing or via phone) within 24 hours of the absence or forfeit the right to make up the absence.
  
  
     Unexcused or excessive absences, or absences that have not been "made up", will directly impact the Participation score: 3 unexcused absences will result in a letter grade deduction from the student's Participation score.  Five or more unexcused absences will result in an "F" Participation score for the semester.  Excessive absences (numbering more than 8) **for any reason** will result in an "F" COURSE score for the semester.   Remember:  an absence affects all members of the student's group - Be Considerate!
  
  
     Excessive tardiness is also something which may affect the Participation score.  Tardiness of between 5 and 30 minutes will be treated in the following manner: more than 3 will result in a deduction of one letter grade from the Participation score, as will each tardiness thereafter.  Tardiness of 30 or more minutes will be treated exactly as an absence.
  
  
     No "make-up" work for missed assignments will be given.  With a timely (within one class period) and acceptable _written excuse_ presented to the instructor, **one Homework set or sun-plot** may be dropped at no penalty.   Excuses normally will be accepted for _personal illness_ or _serious family emergencies_ **only** , and **_require immediate (within 24 hours) notification of the instructor_**.
  
  
     No provisions are made for missing the Midterm or Final Exams, excepting a Doctor's written verification that the student was unable to attend due to serious injury or illness.   This verification _will_ be confirmed.
  
  
     The Semester Project will be collected as stated; there are no non-medical circumstances allowing late submission.   Semester Projects may be submitted early, of course.
  
  
**Cheating:**

     Under no circumstances should any two homework sets (or any other assignments) be identical or overtly similar.   Group work is encouraged; however, every person must present their own work for credit.
  
  
     OSU policies on Academic Dishonesty and Academic Misconduct will be strictly followed.
  
  
**Withdrawals:**

     The last day to drop with an automatic "W" is Friday, 13 April 2001 (no petition required).
  
  
     The last day to drop **all** courses with a "W" or "F" is Friday, 27 April 2001 (by petition only).
  
  
     The University Withdrawal Policy will be strictly followed.
  
**Consumable Materials Fee:**  
The students in Physics 1313 will be assessed a $6.00 consumable materials fee
to be used in replenishing supplies used in the course.  
  
**Office hours:**

  
Students are encouraged to visit their TA or the instructor as needed and as
office hours permit.  We will be sharing our class room and therefore office
hours will probably be constrained.  Office hours will be held in the
classroom or in Chuck's office, as indicated on the top of this page. .
Students may use this time to do additional experiments, address questions
which have arisen, continue with the classroom work, or to make up for a
missed class.  We do this because we want the class to move along, but not at
the expense of undue time pressure.  Of course, students may ask questions and
consult with the staff on any matters at this time.

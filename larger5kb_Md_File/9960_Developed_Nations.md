The Course: Developed Nations is a course that focuses upon selected aspects
of the geography of the technologically advanced countries of the world,
including the European nations; the C.I.S. (former Soviet Union); Japan; the
United States; Canada; and a few others. Emphasis will be placed on Western
Europe and the U.S.A., however.

Grading, attendance procedure and assignments:

Six quizzes or equivalent (2O points each) will be given during the term.
_These may or may not be announced. They will be based upon reading material,
class notes, map work and questions in outline syllabus._ One quiz _may_ be a
take-home type. It is possible, therefore, to earn 120 points on quizzes.
Quizzes, if missed may not be made-up without legitimate excuse. There will be
_one_ major exam (1OO points) at the end of the course. The exam will be
reasonably comprehensive. Quiz grades will account for 6O% of your grade while
the exam will be 4O% of your total grade. _Class participation will be a
consideration when a student is borderline between letter grades._

The open cut system is practiced and as such _you will not be allowed to make
up quizzes without a legitimate excuse for absence_. If a quiz is missed
without an excuse simply consider it dropped. _It is, however, to your
advantage to attend regularly. There is a positive relationship between
regular attendance and good grades._

_Since there is no traditional text your in-class notes are vital for good
grades._

Grades are kept cumulatively and added to the end of the term.

At that time the total points earned are taken as a percentage of the possible
number of points. the following grading system is used and _you should keep a
record of your grades:_

89.5% - 1OO% | = A  
---|---  
79.5% - 89.4%  | = B  
69.5% - 79.4%     | = C  
59.5% - 69.4% | = D  
Below 59.5% | = F  
  


Assignments are usually confined to reading in your Atlas and working on map
work which accompanies each topic country or groupof countries. Occasionally a
reading assignment will be placed on reserve in the library or distributed as
a class handout. _When reading you must read carefully for concepts (ideas)
and not for a grocery list of details._

_Atlas maps suggested in parentheses throughout the course outline are to be
considered as assignments for you to examine and analyze in conjunction with
related concepts._ The Atlas you are referred to is the _Goodes Atlas_. _The
approach employed should keep memorization to a minimum while maximizing the
developemnt of your ability to analyze geographically._

_It is expected that you will put forth some effort and come to class prepared
to participate meaningfully in class discussion._

If at any time you are experiencing difficulty please feel free to contact me.
After a period of five or six weeks a listing of students who agree to serve
as tutors will be distributed.

Course Description  
  
Development of American librarianship from Colonial times to the present, with
special reference to the relationship of library institutions to their
contemporary social, economic, cultural and political enviornments.

Purposes of the Course  
  
This course is intended to provide students with a general overview of the
development of American librarianship.  
  
By the end of the course, students should be able to:

  1. Recognize the essential facts and developments relative to the evolution of American librarianship.
  2. Identify the societal frame in which this evolution took place.
  3. Conceptualize and identify the causal factors which have assisted or impeded librarianship in the United States.

Format of the Course  
  
This class will operate as lecture/discussion. Most of the class sessions will
be lecture-based; part of each class, however, will be set aside to discuss
assigned articles.  
  
As the semester progresses, students will find it useful to keep the following
questions in mind:

  1. What were the characteristics of libraries in each of the chronological periods and/or type of libraries being examined? What kinds of materials did they contain, how were they managed, who used them and for what purpose, what were their major service goals?
  2. What unique contributions or developments (either technical or theoretical) characterize each period and/or type of library.
  3. What societal conditions appear to have had a significant influence on library development at different times and places? Consider, for example, changing financial conditions, differing theories about American government, developments in formal and state sanctioned education, social conditions.
  4. What individuals, groups or libraries are clearly pivotal in the development of American librarianship? How did their influence stamp itself on the profession, in both positive and negative ways? Who are the "invisible" heroes? Why are they invisible? 

  
Evaluation  
  
_Examinations_ : Two examinations will be given. They will consist of four or
five essay questions each, two of which the student must answer. Each will
count 25% of the final grade.  
  
_Book Critiques_ : Students must submit two book critiques on any book on
American library history. OBTAIN APPROVAL OF YOUR SELECTION FROM YOUR
INSTRUCTOR BEFORE SETTLING ON YOUR FINAL CHOICES. Critiques are due on the day
identified on the syllabus. Students should follow the "Guidelines for
Critical Analysis of Scholarly Words" (see below). Each of the critiques will
cout 20% of the final grade.  
  
_Class Participation_ : Because a substantial portion of class time has been
set aside for discussion of readings, class participation will count 10% of
the final grade.  
  
  
  
Require Reading List  
  
(Materials are on CLOSED reserve in the SLIS Library)

"Guidelines for Critical Analysis of Scholarly Works" Read and review
critically any book BASED ON RESEARCH published since 1978 that deals in some
way with librarianship and that represents a professional contribution to the
literature on the subject. (Because your grade for this assignment will in
part be determined by your ability to judge whether the work you select is
indeed based on research, you will not need my approval for the title you
choose.)

The book critique should be wordprocessed on 8 1/2 by 11 inch paper (no
plastic covers please) stapled once in the upper left hand corner, and be
about 1,000 words in length (about four pages, double-spaced type, number the
pages). It should, if possible, include a paragraph describing the author's
background (education, field of specialization, other publications, etc); a
_short_ summary of the content of the book; and a longer critical evaluation.
In the critical evaluation, students should consider the following questions:

1) What is the author's thesis or argument? Does it conflict or support theses
or arguments presented in other books (or important articles) on the subject?

2) What are the author's conclusions? Are they valid? Substantiated? Explain
and defend.

3) Was the author sympathetic or hostile to his/her subject? Offer
illustrations.

4) Are the author's organization and style effective? Do they add or detract
from the impact of the book? In what ways?

5) Of what value is the book? Would you recommend it to others? Why, or why
not?

Above all, do not, DO NOT, simply rehash the contents of the book. As your
instructor I am interested in what _you_ think of the book, and how you see it
fitting into the field of American library and information science literature.
That is the primary reason for writing the review.

Hand in _two_ copies of the review to your instructor on the day identified on
the syllabus. Do _not_ identify yourself by name as author of the critique;
instead, list your student identification number on a cover sheet which also
should contain a full bibliographic citation of the work you are critiquing. I
will hand one of the copies back with assigned grade, and will retain the
other copy for my permanent files.

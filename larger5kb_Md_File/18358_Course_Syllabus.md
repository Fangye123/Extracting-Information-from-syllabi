**Course Goals**  
This course will familiarize students with:

  * the definition and concepts of visual literacy;
  * the impact of visual images on our culture;
  * the creation and use of educational visuals;
  * the inclusion of visuals in instruction; and
  * teaching critical viewing skills to various audiences. 

  
**Course Objectives** (hyperlinks are to corresponding course assignments)  
This course familiarizes students with visual media and helps students develop
the ability to critically analyze and produce visual instruction. Students
will:

  * review and define the concept of visual literacy;
  * analyze visual communications;
  * identify and utilize design (and production) elements in visuals;
  * review visual learning research and apply it to specific projects;
  * examine and understand the development of critical viewing skills;
  * review and utilize current technology through "visual literacy eyes";
  * explain/apply/situate concepts of visual literacy into instructional technology practice and/or settings.

_**Course Assignments**_

_**15% - analyze visual communication**_

1\. a. Participate in class assigned readings, discussions.

> b. Develop a personal visual symbol, and select 5 colorful pictures which
describe a particular characteristic of you (each picture a different trait).

>

> c. Communicate electronically with instructor and classmates, as needed; all
students must activate their NIU e-mail account.

>

>> > > >  

_**15% - identify and utilize design elements in visuals**_

> 2\. Select one visual presentation item (commercial or educational), print
advertisement, photograph or Web Page, and utilize visual design criteria to
discuss and critique the visual presentation, focusing on visual design
characteristics. Copy the visual and make two new visuals changing one design
element in each. Written critique (at most, one page per visual) presented in
class in small discussion groups. (Can be print or electronic.)

_**20% - review visual learning research and apply it to specific projects**_

> 3\. Review at least three related articles or chapters from the IVLA
__Readings__ or others as recommended (see list). Summarize the articles in a
written review paper (approximately 5 pages) in which you discuss the ideas,
and examples of the ways the information could translate to the design of a
project, development of instruction, etc. Prepare to share your ideas in a
group, including examples if available. (Doctoral students should use research
reports as sources.)

**20% \- review and utilize current technology through 'visual literacy
eyes'**

> 4\. Review, critique, and explain the content and design of an educational
or commercial segment of a current motion technology such as a film, a music
video, an advertisement, a video, a World Wide Web site or a CD-ROM. Choose
two or more elements from the definitions of visual literacy presented in
class to focus your review (maximum of 3 pages). Copy your segment or material
and bring to class if possible for a presentation in small groups (may be done
with a partner or small group).

_**30% - explain and apply the concept of visual literacy as situated into
Instructional Technology setting**_ s

> 5\. Individually, or in partners or small groups, develop a final
project/presentation for class. Select an area of interest related to visual
literacy as it applies to your profession, i.e., business, higher education,
K-12 education, etc. (Most people choose a topic related to their earlier
paper)

>

> a. Define/discuss visual literacy in the context of your professional
application

>

> b. Explain how your chosen component of visual literacy is situated in your
area and in Instructional Technology. Visualize your definition and discussion
by providing an example developed for your setting.

>

> The written component (a., b.) should be 2-4 pages in length.

>

> c. This presentation should be highly visual, with visual materials you have
either produced or selected, such as overhead graphics, slides, a PowerPoint
presentation, a Web site, or video, for example. This is the final classroom
presentation in lieu of an exam, (and may be done in small groups).

_**Course Particulars:**_

> This course is fairly introductory and somewhat a "survey" of issues in
visual literacy. It is designed to engage learners in a variety of experiences
which should help them develop their own visual literacy skills and provide
them with ideas/activities to build visual literacy into their own practice.
Engaged learning requires participation, active learning, and often
cooperative learning in groups, through technology. Participation is assumed;
learning will not be effective if students cannot/do not take responsibility
for their own and others learning.

> Grading criteria will be included in the class discussions of assignments;
assignments should be on time and presentations/discussions in class are an
important part of the learning experience. Being a thoughtful and successful
class member includes listening as well as viewing skills.

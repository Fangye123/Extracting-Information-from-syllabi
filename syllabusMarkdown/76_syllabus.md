**Description/Objectives**

Course Description: COM 3332 presents new information and communication
technologies by describing their role in, and how they are shaped by,
contemporary society.

Course Goals: At the end of this course you will be able to:  
\- Summarize the history of, and future trends in, the development and use of
information and communication technologies.  
\- Describe the national and international connections among economics,
politics, the "information society," and information and communication
technologies.  
-  Identify the dynamics shaping, and implications of, the "convergence" of information and communication technologies.   
\- Discuss key consumer, social, ethical, and work issues related to the
design and use of new information and communication technologies.  
\- Summarize the theoretical approaches to understanding new information and
communication technologies.  
    
**Requirements**  
    
Lectures, readings, class discussion participation, and student online
contributions are critical components for successful completion of this
course.  Completing the assigned readings before their corresponding lectures
and discussions allows you to raise relevant questions, and to improve your
learning experience and your class participation experience.

Readings, Lectures, and Activities: On average, you should plan to spend an
average of nine hours per week on this course.  It should take:  
\- three hours per week to attend classes;  
\- two to three hours for readings and their related assignments and
questions;  
\- one hour for reading web materials and posting to online discussion groups,
and;  
\- two to three hours for the preparation of longer assignments or review for
tests.

Participation and Practice Exercises: Attendance and active participation in
class sessions and discussions is an important part of the course.  Class
participation counts for five percent of your grade.

Short Assignments: There will be five short assignments and postings to be
completed throughout the term (September 5, September 12, October 5, October
12, and November 30). These are based on readings, examples, and discussions.
These short assignments together count for ten percent of your grade.

Essay Assignments: You will complete three essays during the term (September
19, October 19, and November 16). These will be approximately five to six
pages (double-spaced) or 1,200- 1,500 words in length.  The first essay counts
for ten percent of your overall grade, while the second and third each count
for fifteen percent

Papers should use a standard citation format.  Assignments, unless otherwise
noted, are to be submitted electronically and in paper format in class.  Late
assignments lose one letter grade per day (or ten percent of the numerical
grade). The criteria for grading include: use of course materials; research;
organization; style and presentation, and; analysis and insight. Spelling,
punctuation, grammar, and clear writing will influence your grade as part of
the "style and presentation" criteria.  If you haven't read it, William Strunk
& E.B. White's The Elements of Style, is a great writing primer and costs
under five dollars.  
Specific assignment instructions and questions will be distributed in class
and will be available on the course web site.

Tests: You will take three tests (September 28, November 2, and December 13),
composed of multiple choice and essay questions, drawn from assigned readings
and lectures. These tests will cover the material listed in each section of
the course (and will not be cumulative). Each test counts for fifteen percent
of your final grade.  
    
Readings:  The main textbook for the course is:

Joseph Straubhaar and Robert LaRose, Media Now: Communications Media in the
Information Society (Second Edition) (Belmont, California: Wadsworth
Publishing, 2000).  ISBN 0-534-76295-6.

Two supplemental texts provide additional concepts and arguments for use in
discussions and essay assignments.  They are:

Roger Fidler, MediaMorphosis: Understanding New Media (Thousand Oaks,
California, Pine Forge Press, 1997). ISBN 0-8039-9086-3.

Andrew Shapiro, The Control Revolution (New York: Public Affairs/Century
Foundation, 1999). ISBN  1-891620-19-3.

Additional readings and activities will be posted on or linked to the COM3332
course website.

E-mail and World Wide Web: You will need an FSU e-mail account and familiarity
with searching and navigating the World Wide Web for research and
communication during this course.  You can arrange to forward your FSU e-mail
to another account, but automatic inclusion in the course distribution list
and access to some FSU library materials only works for FSU accounts.

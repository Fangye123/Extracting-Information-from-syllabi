This syllabus is designed to keep you updated with course requirements and
expectations. Included in the syllabus are the course goals, objectives for
learning, various reference sources and information about the course grading.

Powerpoint presentations for lectures, as well as other miscellaneous
material, may be accessed via the Web Board

**_COURSE DESCRIPTION_**  
  
---  
  
Students study the relationship and application of clinical biochemistry to
the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of human disease. Lecture and
laboratory integrate theoretical principles and the application of analytical
techniques of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, enzymes, electrolytes, nitrogen
metabolites, inborn errors of metabolism, therapeutic drug monitoring, and
toxicology.

**_COURSE GOALS_**  
  
---  
  
This course will introduce the student to the theories and techniques of
clinical biochemistry. In addition, the course will expose the student to the
knowledge, skills and abilities required to build confidence in the practice
of clinical biochemistry. Achievement of these goals will lead to the
production of an accomplished and well-rounded clinical biochemistry
professional.

**_COURSE EXPECTATIONS_**  
  
---  
  
This course of study is structured in such a way as to provide you the
opportunity to understand and learn the art and science of clinical
biochemistry. Learning and understanding of materials taught will be made
possible by attending class, following directions and instructions, asking
questions and participating actively in the learning process. To complete the
course requirements and pass the course successfully, you will have to be
fully committed to the learning process. To this end, you must adhere to
course policies and requirements.

**_COURSE POLICIES AND REQUIREMENTS_**  
  
---  
  
**Attendance:** Tardiness, leaving class, or not being present in class
reduces your learning opportunity and consequently affect your grade. Absences
may result in missed laboratory exercises and lost opportunity to obtain
needed information. All of these will result in point deductions. However,
unusual circumstances resulting in tardiness and absences will be considered
on a case by case basis by the instructor. The circumstance must be
communicated to the instructor as soon as possible in the cases of tardiness
or within twenty-four hours from the class time missed in cases of absence.
You will have to negotiate make-up work with the instructor in the cases of
excused absences.

**Assignments:** Assignments such as reading and laboratory reports must be
completed _before_ class. The Laboratory Policies handout may be accessed by
following this link.

**Management of resources:** You must prioritize class time, follow
instructions, and ask questions when you do not understand.

**Academic integrity:** The instructor abides by the FGCU policy on academic
integrity.

**Grading:** Based upon the following scale:

> A= 100-90%  
>  B= 89-80%  
>  C= 79-70%  
>  D= 69-60%  
>  F= <60%

**_Lecture:_** | **65%** | **_Laboratory:_** | **35%**  
---|---|---|---  
  | 30% Two Exams; 15% each |   | 35% Laboratory Exercises  
  | 15% Unannounced Quizzes |   |  
  | 20% Comprehensive Final Exam* |   |  
  
*Note: a minimum score of 70% is required on the comprehensive final exam for an overall course grade of B or higher. The +/- grading system will _not_ be used.

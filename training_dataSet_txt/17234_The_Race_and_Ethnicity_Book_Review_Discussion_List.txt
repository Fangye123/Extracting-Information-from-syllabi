POS334-L is a discussion list constructed for the Race, Ethnicity and Social Inequality seminar (formerly numbered POS302) held each spring semester at Illinois State University. Subscription to the list is open to all faculty and students at any University or College. The discussion on the list consists
of book reviews and commentaries on book reviews submitted by the subscribers. The purposes of the list are to provide an audience for the work of the students in the seminar, to provide the seminar with an external source of opinion and insight on the readings under discussion, and to provide all subscribers
with an public forum for the discussion of contemporary books on race, ethnicity, and social inequality.


The list is hosted by the Matrix center at Michigan State University.
              


Graduate and Undergraduate students are especially encouraged to submit book reviews to the list and to participate in the discussions.  Faculty are encouraged to use this list with their classes.
              


The discussion list is open for reviews of books on race and ethnicity at any time, including books that are not on the class schedule.

FORMAT AND CONTENT OF COMMENTARIES:
            



The POS334-L aims for serious and thoughtful academic discussion, it is not a forum for stating personal opinions. PLEASE REFRAIN FROM SENDING SHORT SPONTANEOUS REACTIONS TO A BOOK OR REVIEW TO THE LIST. Commentaries should be at least 100 words in length and should reflect a reading of the work or other
works of the author. Note that automatic replies to messages sent from the list will normally go directly to the original sender, messages to the list must be addressed to POS334-L@H-net.msu.edu




MODERATION:
            



Many of these works are controversial and the subject matter concerns a topic that sometimes provokes heated exchanges in other settings. Rather than having a formal set of standards for decency and good taste, the members of the class at Illinois State will act as referees, upon majority vote of the
class, I will kick anyone off the list whose messages do not contribute to its general educational purposes.
              





Please remember at all times that many of the people on this list are students, that students are people, that they are trying to learn, and that they will make mistakes and say things that are wrong. We learn from our mistakes. It is just as important not to take offense as it is not to be offensiv

*If I were asked to designate the most thrilling years...from the year of my birth in 1873 to the present year, 1950, I would say the years between 1900 and 1914. Life was full of hope and freedom. Great movements were starting everywhere. In the United States, the loudest voice in the land was that of the liberal. Everyone was fighting for something. Everyone was sure of victory.* 

\--Unpublished writings, quoted in American Women in the Progressive Era,
1900-1920 by Dorothy Schneider and Carl Schneider, p. iii.

This course will examine the exciting, optimistic, frustrating, inspiring, and
incredibly complex period in our nation's history known as the Progressive
Era. Our goal is not *just* achieve an understanding of this elusive period,
but to have that understanding illuminate our current political and social
views.

According to a Chinese proverb:  
I hear and I forget  
I see and remember  
I do and I understand.

Therefore, your grade for the course will be determined by:  
Participation 50%  
Research Paper 25%  
Weekly Papers 25%

The first thing you'll want to do is to subscribe to Society For Historians of
the Gilded Age and Progressive Era (SHGAPE) list on H-net. SHGAPE is a very
dynamic resource that includes three major programs: the daily e-mail
discussion list, the website, and the book review program. Take advantage of
all three.

To subscribe to the daily e-mail discussion list, address your message to
[Listserv@msu.edu](mailto:Listserv@msu.edu)

then send this one-line email message:  
subscribe h-shgape firstname, lastname, Santa Clara U.

If you don't get a response within a day or so, notify me. Once you are on the
list you will be sent a welcoming message that contains important information
(like how to get OFF the list at the end of the quarter) so make sure you
print and/or save that message.

The SHGAPE Website address is: <http://h-net2.msu.edu/~shgape>

To go directly to resources:  
<http://h-net2.msu.edu/~shgape/resources.html>

I cannot exaggerate the wealth of valuable information available through this
website. You can examine the syllabi of progressive era courses being offered
around the country--and consult extensive bibliographic materials, including a
number of fine historiographical essays. Don't overlook this invaluable
resource as your prepare to research your selected topic. A former colleague
of mine who used to go to great pains to personally compile the most
comprehensive source list possible now simply refers them to the Web.

In a seminar, informed discussion is everything. This is a very rigorous, time
consuming course. Although each week's combined reading is *only* 200 pages
(or less), the articles are, for the most part, sophisticated and challenging,
requiring not just a quick skim through but careful reading and thoughtful
reflection. Look over this syllabus (and the handout on paper requirements)
carefully and make sure that you have sufficient time and energy required by
this course. I guarantee that your *investment* will pay off handsomely, not
only in subsequent history courses but across the disciplines and in
professional life. (I eschew false modesty)

This is your opportunity to develop a number of important skills in a
friendly, comfortable atmosphere. Here there are no *dumb* questions (well,
very few, anyway) and students can examine and debate a variety of
interpretations as they explore a complex subject. Critical thinking,
curiosity, and enthusiasm are vital elements we all must bring to the table if
the course is to be a success.

Each week's readings include both primary and secondary sources. All readings
have been selected to present you with a variety of views on the particular
week's topic. They are arranged in the order that I anticipate the discussion
will naturally flow, but you may approach them in whatever order makes the
most sense to you. This is your seminar. The readings are designed to
facilitate discussion: my job is direct that discussion, not dominate it.

To further facilitate thoughtful discussion, a brief (2 page) paper on each
week's readings will be due, in my box in O'Connor 17, by 10:30 the Wednesday
morning of each class day. Late papers will NOT be accepted except in case of
verifiable emergency. Make sure to bring your own copy of your paper to class.
Each week's paper should begin with a general question (or two or three) the
combined readings have evoked. The remainder of the paper will be your attempt
to answer that question based on the most persuasive of the various views of
the week's authors.

The two books required for the course are *The Tyranny of Change: America in
the Progressive Era 1890-1920* by John Whiteclay Chambers II and *Amusing The
Million* by John Kasson. All other readings are organized into weekly files
and can be found on reserve in the library. If your budget allows, I strongly
recommend that you photocopy these readings. This not only allows you
unlimited access, you can mark passages you find troubling, inspiring,
confusing, profound, etc., etc., and refer to them in class.

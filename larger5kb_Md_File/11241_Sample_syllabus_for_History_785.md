Unlike most graduate courses in American history, our course will not focus on
the history of a particular period, but on rival approaches to and
interpretations of the general course of early American history. Our goal is
to learn to read historical interpretations critically, to understand the
historical circumstances in which they appear and gain prominence, and to
consider why one interpretation succeeds another. We will spend the first
weeks of the course discussing critical theory and the history of
interpretations of American history, rather than the history of early America.
Next, we will use our knowledge of criticism and historiography to examine
recent attempts to articulate a new "grand theory" of American history:
Wiebe's SELF RULE and Greenstone's LINCOLN PERSUASION. In the final weeks, we
will turn to seven recent monographs and readers. We will consider whether we
are indeed on the verge of another interpretive shift and explore the
possibility of a democratic re-interpretation of American history.

Mah, or other critics of historical discourse. The second will focus on a
particular theme in the work of an author or pair of authors we discuss (e.g.,
Dowd and Frey on the politics of multiculturalism; McGaw and Bensel on the
role of institutions in a democratic society).

COURSE SYLLABUS

  
  
  
  
  
  
  

_Description_

An examination of the history and development of historic preservation law in
the United States. Through an analysis of significant national, state and
local preservation laws, ordinances and cases, this course will introduce
students to the basic concepts involved in the newly emerging specialty of
historic preservation law. The goals of the course include: (1) establishing a
basic understanding of legal concepts; (2) promoting a sense of familiarity
with legal principles and case law; and (3) providing a framework for students
seeking careers in the preservation field.

_Requirements_

1\. Assigned readings and participation in class

Every student is expected to come to class prepared to discuss the reading
assignment. In order to develop a full understanding of the material students
should read all assignments carefully! Students must realize that when dealing
with legal materials a single reading is usually not sufficient; multiple
readings are necessary in order to fully comprehend reading assignments.

Students must _bring assigned reading materials to class_.

2\. Case Research Assignment

Each student will be asked to conduct an on-line LEXIS-NEXIS search to locate
a preservation case. Case citations, assigned by the instructor, will be
distributed in class along with detailed instructions outlining how to use the
LEXIS-NEXIS database. Each student will also be asked to answer a list of
questions regarding his/her assigned case.

3\. Test 1 - Constitutional Law

4\. Test 2 - Federal Framework

5\. Local Ordinance Analysis

Each student will be required to obtain a local historic preservation
ordinance (along with any relevant regulations or other guidelines). Any local
ordinance is acceptable to use _except_ the City of Fredericksburg, VA
ordinance (a sign-up sheet will be circulated to avoid duplications).
Students interested in analyzing an ordinance from Virginia may want to use
the Virginia Local Preservation Reference Collection, an online database
available through the Center for Historic Preservation web site.  Each student
will be asked to analyze his/her local ordinance in terms of its content and
perceived effectiveness based on material covered in reading assignments and
class discussion.

6\. Special Topic Presentation

Each student will be asked to research and prepare a presentation on a legal
or public policy issue of interest that will not be covered formally in class.
Every student will submit a special topic presentation proposal (a typed
paragraph outlining the topic as well as research resources) on the assigned
date so that the instructor and student can mutually agree on a topic.  Each
presentation should be between 7 and 10 minutes in length and give the
audience an introduction to, as well as an explanation of, the topic.

7\. Final Exam (cumulative)  


_Grading Criteria_

The course requirements will be graded on a point system in order to enable
students to keep track of their progress easily. The point system is as
follows:  
  100 | Class discussion and participation  
---|---  
50 | Case Research Assignment  
50 | Test 1 - Constitutional Law  
50 | Test 2 - Federal Framework  
100 | Local Ordinance Analysis  
50 | Special Topic Presentation  
_100_ |  Final Exam  
500 | Total Points  
  


Individual Assignments  


For individual assignments, each student will be given a point value. The
percentage can be calculated by dividing the point value by the total number
of points available. For example, if an assignment is worth a total of 50
points and a student receives 44 points, the equivalent percentage is 44/50 or
88% (a B+). The instructor will typically give students both the point value
and the equivalent percentage when handing back assignments.  


Grading Scale (reminder: the new plus/minus system goes into effect this fall)  
  For individual assignment grades | A | 100% - 94%  
---|---|---  
| A- | 93% - 90%  
| B+ | 89% - 87%  
| B | 86% - 83%  
| B- | 82% - 80%  
| C+ | 79% - 77%  
| C | 76% - 73%  
| C- | 72% - 70%  
| D+ | 69% - 67%  
| D | 66% - 60%  
| F | below 60%  
  
  For Course grades | A | 500-470  | points  
---|---|---|---  
| A- | 469-450 |  
| B+ | 449-435 | points  
| B | 434-415 |  
| B- | 414-400 |  
| C+ | 399-385 | points  
| C | 384-365 |  
| C- | 364-350 |  
| D+ | 349-335 | points  
| D | 334-300 |  
| F | 299 or less | points  
  


**Note:** No passing grade can be achieved in this course without the
completion of _each and every_ course requirement.  


_Assignments_  


All assignments _must be pledged_. In the event an assignment is turned in
without being pledged, the instructor reserves the right to withhold recording
a grade until an assignment is pledged and resubmitted. Students are expected
to abide by the provisions of the MWC Honor Code when completing all
assignments.  


All assignments must be stapled or paper clipped and are due on the assigned
date at the _BEGINNING_ of class unless specified otherwise by the instructor.
**There will be a 5 minute grace period at the beginning of class while the
instructor collects assignments. Any assignment that is turned in after the 5
minute grace period will automatically be marked down the equivalent of one
letter grade (no exceptions!). Thereafter, for every _hour_ the assignment is
past due the equivalent of one letter grade will be deducted.**  
    


_Make-up Tests_

A student who has an excused absence for either test will be allowed to take a
make-up test during the last week of classes. _Make-up tests will not be given
on any other date_.  


_Computer Problems_  


When completing all assignments, students are expected to allow sufficient
time for computer-related problems, including printing. However, every student
in the course is allotted one (1), and _only_ one, computer "freebie" for the
semester with respect to late assignments. This "freebie" will constitute an
exception to the late assignment policy stated above; provided that the
student notifies the instructor _before_ class of the technical problem.  


_Classroom Behavior_  


Each and every student is expected to be respectful and attentive when other
students are making comments or asking questions. In order to maintain an
atmosphere that is conducive to learning and participation, rude and
disruptive behavior will not be tolerated. Additionally, while the instructor
encourages class participation from everyone, students with a tendency to be
outspoken are asked to keep their participation to a reasonable level so that
they do not monopolize class time or intimidate other students.  


_Cell Phones and Pagers_  


Out of respect for all students, cell phones and pagers must be turned off
during the time that class is in session. If a student has an emergency,
please ask that someone call the department main number (654-1041) and Judy
Brushwood will see that a message reaches you.

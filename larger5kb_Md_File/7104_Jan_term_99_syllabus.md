**Course description:**  
    
This course will introduce students to a genre of history known as
"microhistory."  Microhistory  
began to appear in the early 1980's, and has become one of the most
influential (and best selling)  
forms of historical writing.  A typical work of microhistory consists of a
detailed narrative of a striking -- even bizarre -- event from the past, often
an event in the life of an obscure or humble person who would not, until
recently, have been considered an appropriate subject for serious historical
study.  
    
In this course, we will read, discuss, and write about several of the most
respected works of  
microhistory that have appeared in the past two decades.  Our goal will be to
understand why  
historians have come to believe that the strange stories they tell are
important, and why the obscure lives that they bring to light deserve our
attention.

**Requirements:**  
    
20%    Paper #1       due as assigned  
20%    Paper #2       due as assigned  
20%    Exam #1        January 15  
20%    Exam #2        January 27  
20%    Participation in discussions and in-class writing assignments

The papers will be short book reviews, 3-4 typed pages in length.  Topics and
due dates will be  
assigned on the first day of the course in such a way that roughly one third
of the class will be writing on each of the major works that we will be
discussing.  Papers will be due at the beginning of class, and no late papers
will be accepted.  Exams will consist of short "identification" questions.
The second exam will not be cumulative.  Grades for all assignments will be
based primarily on the signs you show of having given serious thought to the
readings.  In calculating your final course grade I will give credit for
improved performance.  Feel free to consult me about how you are doing.  
    
**Attendance:**  
    
Attendance is required at all class meetings.  Students who miss more than two
class meetings for  
unacceptable reasons will be dropped from the course.  I will advise you and
your mentor if and  
when your next absence will have this result.  If you have a valid reason for
missing class, please  
inform me in writing (or by e-mail) as soon as possible.  Students who are
egregiously or habitually late to class, or who come to class unprepared, will
be counted as absent.

**Makeups and incompletes:**

Makeups for exams and papers will be given only in case of conflicts with
scheduled college activities (please inform me in advance) or in case of
documentable emergencies clearly beyond your control.  Incompletes will be
assigned only in cases of documentable emergency.  
    
**Academic integrity:**  
    
All work in this course will be governed by the Academic Integrity Policies of
Austin College.  By  
enrolling in the course, you agree to inform yourself of these policies and to
abide by them.  Although you are encouraged to discuss the course material
with other students outside of class, the work you submit must be your own.
In particular, when you submit a paper, it must contain your own ideas in your
own words.  Ideas or information that you get elsewhere -- from a friend, a
professor, a textbook, a book from the library, or any other source -- must be
acknowledged specifically.  This is true whether you are quoting directly or
not.  Paraphrasing another person's ideas does not make them your own.

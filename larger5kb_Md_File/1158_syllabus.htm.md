                                                                    \--Basil Bunting

  
  
  

**_Required texts_** :

1.  Matthews and Platt, _The Western Humanities_ , Vol. 1: Beginnings through the Renaissance (4th edition) 

2.  Matthews & Platt, _Readings in the Western Humanities_ , Vol. 1 (4th edition) 

**_Course Description_** :

        This course will track the development of the arts and ideas of Western Culture from prehistory and the ancient world to 1500 and the beginnings of the European Renaissance.  Discussion of history, politics, philosophy, science, and religion will form the background for an examination of the artistic, architectural, literary, theatrical, and musical heritage belonging to contemporary Western societies such as our own. 

**_Course objectives_** :

        Among the specific objectives are: to acquire a familiarity with the breadth and depth of the Western cultural heritage and a greater appreciation for the connections with our own aesthetic and ideological conditions, both societally and individually; to learn basic concepts important to the study of culture; and to gain skill in the critical evaluation appropriate to this endeavor.  More general objectives include: to enhance and enlarge aesthetic and perceptual capacities; to improve critical thinking skills; to improve communication skills; and to stimulate creativity. 

**_Course requirements_** :

        Students will be expected to be well prepared for class: to field questions concerning the assigned topics, and to engage in discussion.  Attendance is mandatory; more than three absences will count against the final grade, 2 points for each.  There will be five in-class tests (multiple choice) and no final exam. **NOTE WELL:** Make-up tests will be scheduled only in cases of true emergency, and only for those students who provide legitimate documentation AND contact me NO LATER THAN the day of the test.   Do NOT come to me at the next class, or a week later, and say, "Dr. K, I missed the test.  Can I take a make-up?"  And do NOT just leave me a phone message, or an email message, and hope that I get back to you.  It is YOUR responsibility to talk with me directly.  ALL make-up tests will be given on the last day of class. 

        Grades for this course will be assigned on the basis of combined test scores, 20% for each.  Homework and valuable class contributions can bump your final score either up or down 1 to 2 points. 

        The grading scale, which I follow strictly, is as follows: 

        A 92-100; A- 90-91; B+ 88-89; B 82-87; B- 80-81; C+ 78-79; C 72-77; C- 70-71; D 60-69; F  below 60\.

>  V. Academic Integrity  
>  
>  
>  
>  The very nature of higher education requires that students adhere to
accepted standards of academic integrity. Therefore, Oakton Community College
has adopted a Code of Academic Conduct and a statement of Student Academic
Integrity. These may be found in the Student Handbook. You may also find a
summary of the Code of Academic Conduct in the College Catalog. Among the
violations of academic integrity listed and defined are: cheating, plagiarism,
falsification and fabrication, abuse of academic materials, complicity in
academic dishonesty, falsification of records and official documents, personal
misrepresentation and proxy, and bribes,  
>  favors, and threats.  
>  
>  It is the student's responsibility to be aware of behaviors that constitute
academic dishonesty.  
>  
>  Pursuant to the due process guarantees contained in the Policy and
Procedures on Student Academic Integrity, the minimum punishment for the first
offense for a student found in violation of the standards of academic
integrity is failure in the assignment. In addition, a disciplinary record
will be established and kept on file in the office of the Vice President for
Student Affairs for a period of three years.

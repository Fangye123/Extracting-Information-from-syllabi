specialized speech styles (chant, prayer, speaking in tongues, etc), sacred
texts and translation thereof, etc.

2\. Learn various ways religions use language to implement religious tasks and
religious ideals.

3\. Learn something about unfamiliar religious, although studying the beliefs
of specific religions is only a secondary goal.

mentioned below:

###  Wk 2.  Jan 14.  Phonetics and **Language Change**

**          Read:** _  Linguistics for Beginners _ (online text)

* _[3\. History of English](http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb8/misc/lfb/html/text/3frame.html)_
* _[4\. Middle English](http://www.uni-kassel.de/fb8/misc/lfb/html/text/4frame.html)_
* [How to Create New Words](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/creating.words.html)
* [Some Neologisms in English](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/newwords.html)
* [English Bible translation for 1000 years.](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/bible.english.html)

  
**_Conclusion_ :** Languages inevitably change. In 100 years, it is barely
noticeable. In 200 years (think of the _Declaration of Independence_ ) it is
easy to see. In 400 years, intelligibility is very seriously impaired (think
of the _King James Bible_ and Shakespeare). In 1000 years, quite impossible to
understand without lots of   training (think of Chaucer).

**Wk 3.   Jan 21.  What is a Religion? The case of Shinto.**

* **[Homework 1,](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/homework_1.htm) due Monday Jan 28, midnite.  New version posted Jan 24.**
* **Read** :

> * [What is
Religion?](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/whatisreligion.html)

> * [What is
Shinto?](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/shinto.sketch.html)

> * **_On Common Ground_.** [Section of 3 essays on
Shinto](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/shinto.ocg.fixed.html).
For this week, I have prepared the OCG 3 essays about Shinto into a text file
(called `` _The Way of the Kami'', ``Shinto Comes to America'_ ' and ``
_Purification: Wand or Waterfall'_ '). I still recommend using the OCG CD
since it has a variety of pictures as well.  I do not plan to do this for the
other religion sections, however, since it was quite time consuming to
prepare.

>  
>        In general, for each religion in Section 2 of OCG, the display has
the following list across the top:  ` _Files, Resources, Bookmark, Contents,
Religions'_ and then the name of the religion in this section, like ` _Shinto_
'. If you click on this last word, you will see the titles of the essays about
that religion.

 Recommended web resources about Shinto. Some have interesting photos.

* [Shinto page](http://www.religioustolerance.org/shinto.htm)at `ReligiousTolerance.org'. A nice quick summary of many features. (about 5 pages)
* [An Introduction to Shinto](http://fefadmin.org/archive/readers/601_shinto.htm). by Meredith Sprunger (3 pages)
* [Shinto, ](http://www.jinja.or.jp/english/s-0.html)with many good pictures if you keep looking but the text is full of English errors and typos.
**_Conclusion_ :**  Christianity, Judaism and Islam share many features.  All
three provide answers to as similar set of questions (about one's fate
following death, about what kind of behavior God wants to exhibit, about the
origin of life and our world, etc). But not all religions deal with these
issues. For example, Shinto addresses quite a different questions.

####  **Week 4.   Jan 28.  Religious Speech Styles: Chant and Rhythmic
Speech**

> **Read:**

> * [Rhythmic Speech, Chanting and Rhythmic Action
](http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~port/teach/relg/chant.doc)by R. Port (9 pages).
This article is an expansion of the lecture materials.   The logical
progression of the paper is from _periodic patterns  _ to _oscillations_ as
the basis for them.. From oscillation to the _entrainment or coupling_ of
several oscillators (eg, mother's body and child-on-swing), to _self-
entrainment_ (coupling one oscillating part of the body with another
oscillating part of the body, such as the two hands), to _meter_ as two or
more coupled, self-entrained oscillators with _integer ratio frequencies_.

**_Conclusions_ :**  Humans _love to talk rhythmically_ and seem almost unable
to avoid it.    In particular, language employed for religious purposes is
frequently chanted, sung or preached in a strongly rhythmical way.  Chant
appears to be psychologically calming  and, when performed in unison, actively
symbolizes group solidarity and unity.

####  Week 5.  Feb 4.  Hinduism: Role of Chant in the _Bhagavad Gita_.

> **[Homework

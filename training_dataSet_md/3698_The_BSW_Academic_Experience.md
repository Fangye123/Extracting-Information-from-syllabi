**THE BSW ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE**

The Curriculum Policy Statement of the Council on Social Work Education that
guides this curriculum appears in the Appendix. An accredited Bachelor of
Social Work Degree requires a well-designed, broad liberal arts base similar
to that required of many other professional disciplines. In addition, courses
are required in the following professional areas: Human Behavior and the
Social Environment, Social Policy, Social Research, and Generalist Social Work
Practice, including a semester-long internship during the final semester.

**_The Advising Process_**. Students should arrange appointments with the
advisor as soon as the advisor is assigned upon the student's declaration of
social work as a major. The advisor will maintain a permanent folder as a
record of the student's individualized course of study. This record is updated
at each semester's advising period or as needed.

Advisors post office hours and are available by phone and E-mail. However, it
is the student's responsibility to initiate appointments. As indicated in the
University catalog, the ultimate responsibility for taking prescribed courses
belongs to the student. Students who choose to make independent changes in
schedules after having been advised are at risk for late internships and
delayed graduations.

The advisor's signature is essential for a priority registration Personal
Identification Number (PIN) which gives access to the telephone registration
system. Priority registration is important in order to gain placement in
required classes.

**_Academic Requirements_**. Some basic academic requirements include:

  * While some social work courses may be used as electives by non-majors, only social work majors may enroll in practice courses and/or the internship. 
  * Social Work does not offer a minor. 
  * A minimum of C is required in each social work course. 
  * No social work course may be repeated more than one time. 
  * No social work course may be attempted until all prerequisites are completed. 
  * All lower division requirements must be met before one may enroll in SW 436 or SW 437, the senior practice courses. 
  * All other course work must be completed before enrolling in the internship (SW 495); permission of faculty is also required. 
  * Since so much of the social work skills and knowledge base must be acquired experientially from interactions with faculty and other students, attendance is a very important issue. Students are allowed four absences for which there will be no penalty (two for those classes that meet only once a week). This includes absences for illness or family situations. Any additional absences for any reason will result in a deduction of two points from the final grade for each absence. Students who for any reason miss more than one third of class sessions in any social work course will fail the course, regardless of their grades. 
  * Many social work courses contain a great deal of experiential learning. Students are expected to be prepared for class by reading all assigned materials prior to the class session. 
  * Social work students are expected to demonstrate college level verbal and written communication skills. Writing skills will be considered in grading of all written assignments. 
  * Critical thinking is basic to social work education. This involves energetic analysis of material, questioning information and positions of others, identifying and examining one's own biases, and assuring that one's conclusions accurately follow the information being considered. 
  * Honesty and integrity are essential elements of the academic environment. Any dishonest behaviors will be addressed by the course professor and MAY result in failure of the course. See the campus M BOOK for a complete statement of the University policy on dishonesty. (A copy of this policy appears in the Appendix.) 
  * No academic credit is given for life experience, including volunteer experiences,  
employment, or courses from non-accredited schools.

**_Transfer courses_**. Social work courses will be accepted for transfer if

(1) the courses were taken at another institution accredited by Council on
Social Work Education, * AND

(2) the catalog description or syllabus is consistent with the University of
Mississippi syllabus.

**_*senior practice courses and the internship must be taken at the University
of Mississippi_**

The only exception to the above rules is that SW 315: INTRODUCTION TO SOCIAL
WORK may be transferred from community colleges or other regionally accredited
institutions, provided the course syllabus is consistent with the University
of MS syllabus. The articulation agreement between the Institutions of Higher
Learning (College and Universities Board) and the System of Community Colleges
requires that certain courses, including Introduction to Social Work, be
accepted for transfer.

**_Permission to take courses at other colleges or universities_**. Students
who wish to take courses at other schools should discuss with the academic
advisor as to whether social work courses can be accepted for transfer. Actual
permission to take these and other courses must be obtained from the Office of
the Dean of Applied Sciences. WITHOUT SUCH APPROVAL, TRANSFERRED HOURS MAY NOT
BE ACCEPTED. It is not permissible to be enrolled at another school at the
same time one is enrolled at the University of Mississippi.

**_Academic Support Services_**. The University adheres to the guidelines of
the Americans with Disabilities Act. Services are offered through the Office
of Disability Services for Students in the Lucius Williams Learning Center on
campus, 232-7128. Faculty members are able to make recommendations about
possible tutors and support services in the community, such as the Oxford-
Lafayette Literacy Council.

All faculty members are qualified by education, training, licensure, and
experience to engage in personal counseling to address matters that are
affecting the academic experience. Faculty will make referrals to other
sources on campus if it appears that there is a possible conflict of interest
in counseling one's own students or if it appears that the situation will
demand more time than the professor has to contribute. To avoid conflicts of
interests, counseling will be limited to academic concerns.

For personal and confidential counseling, students may also contact Student
Health Services, 232-7274, or the Psychology Clinic at 232-7385.

**_Academic Appeals/Grievance Procedure_**. The Department of Social Work
supports students' rights to appeal any grade that is believed to have been
awarded arbitrarily or unjustly. The Department subscribes to the university's
academic appeals procedure that is open to any student who receives a course
grade which is believed to have been based on prejudice, discrimination,
arbitrary or capricious actions, or other reasons not related to academic
performance. Procedures and time tables are carefully detailed in the
University M BOOK, as referenced in the appendix to this handbook.  
  
The student, who holds responsibility for burden of proof, must first appeal
the grade with the course instructor. If agreement is not reached at this
level, the appeal may progress through the Department Chair, to the Dean of
the School of Applied Sciences. Either the student or the instructor may
appeal a decision at the Dean's level by making a written request for a review
by an Academic Appeals Committee. The decision of the Academic Appeals
Committee is final.

A final grade is the instructor's evaluation of the student's work and
achievement throughout a semester's attendance in a course. Factors upon which
the grade may be based are attendance, recitation, written and oral quizzes,
reports, papers, final examinations, and other class activities as required in
the course syllabus.

The M Book specifies time lines for each phase of the appeal. If either party
fails to respond within the allotted time, the disposition of the case made in
the last previous step shall be final.

**_Structure of Curriculum and Sequencing of Courses_**. The BSW curriculum is
purposely structured to provide a strong liberal arts base to support the
professional courses. Sequencing of courses is designed to maximize the
horizontal and vertical integration of the general education core and the
professional core. It is therefore mandatory that courses be taken in
appropriate sequence. Minimal flexibility is allowed at the discretion of
faculty advisors.

Students may use the department's "Sequencing of Courses" and "Checklist of
Graduation Requirements" sheets as checking devices to note progress through
the curriculum. The student's transcript in the Office of the Registrar is the
official record of progress toward graduation. Students should check this
transcript periodically, particularly in reference to any grade changes,
transferred credits, etc.

**_Social Work Internship_**. The final semester in the BSW experience is the
internship, SW 495: SOCIAL WORK INTERNSHIP (9 hours) and its companion seminar
SW 496: INTERNSHIP SEMINAR (3 hours). The internship carries a Z or pass-fail
grade; the seminar carries a letter grade. After collaborations among
students, agency staff, and faculty, assignment of the grade is the
responsibility of the Department of Social Work faculty. THE INTERNSHIP IS FOR
SOCIAL WORK MAJORS ONLY.

Internship settings throughout Mississippi and in Memphis, Tennessee, are
chosen based upon the setting's compatibility with the mission, goals, and
objectives of the Department of Social Work. The setting must provide an
educationally-directed field experience, directed by qualified field
instructors who will facilitate the student's learning according to the
student-university-agency learning contract.

Key points to remember about the internship:

  * All other degree requirements, including GPA of 2.0 must be met prior to beginning internship. 
  * The field coordinator and faculty liaison will arrange for the placement; students DO NOT initiate their own placements. 
  * Internship is a thirteen-week, forty hour per week experience for a total of 520 hours. 
  * Internships may be completed in any approved setting in Mississippi or in Memphis, TN, with consideration for the professional interests and geographic needs of the student. 
  * Oxford has VERY FEW placement opportunities. Priority for Oxford area is given to physically challenged students, non-traditional students with children, and other local residents. 
  * Having a lease in Oxford is not reason to merit a placement in Oxford. 
  * Malpractice insurance and automobile liability insurance are required (if auto is to be used in internship). Malpractice insurance is available through National Association of Social Workers membership. Acquiring same is explained in SW 450 prior to the internship. 

The process of arranging for the internship is as follows:

  * Apply for NASW membership no later than second semester, junior year. (Applications are available in departmental office.) 
  * First semester, senior year, complete application for degree. 
  * Semester prior to internship, in SW 450, file request for field of service and preferred geographic location and submit application for malpractice insurance. 
  * Toward end of semester prior to internship, faculty will arrange for preplacement visit with agency. 
  * Student will make all arrangements about relocation, living, paying of tuition, etc. 

Process and Procedures during Internship. The internship usually proceeds as
follows:

  * Preplacement visit and signing of contract 
  * First day or week - orientation at the discretion of the agency 
  * Agency staff will model agency activity and procedures 
  * Student will gradually enter into agency activity 
  * Regular conferences with agency field instructor 
  * Three evaluation conferences with field liaison 
  * Student will submit weekly written reports to liaison 
  * Other written assignments as described in Internship Manual
  * Periodic integrative seminars on campus 
  * Final evaluation and grading

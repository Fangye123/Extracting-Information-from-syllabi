  |       The second semester of Western Civ., called "Modern World
Civilization: History and Literature," carries the course through the 19th and
20th centuries into current events. During these last two centuries the world
and the west have been transformed economically, politically, socially, and
intellectually. The political revolutions of the 19th and 20th centuries have
altered forever the ways we see ourselves politically. Economic changes
brought about by the Industrial Revolution hold the promise of material plenty
for all and the threat of ecological destruction as well. Increasingly, social
equality has come to replace the idea of a natural aristocracy as the key to
civilized society. Finally, the intellectual world has broadened and
fragmented, raising the question of whether there is now or can ever be a
unity of world view among westerners, let alone among all people. Thus men and
women in the late 20th century face an increasingly complex world without many
of the old intellectual assurances that their fathers and mothers took for
granted. This course also looks at these themes with an increased emphasis on
the North American perspective of the aspects of these phenomena. Thus, we as
North Americans can place our own history more completely in the context of
the west. | ![](CivB2.JPG)

Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries saw the opening up of new
worlds of knowledge. Alongside geographical exploration, the people of this
age witnessed a transformation in what was known of the universe and a
considerable expansion in available information about nature. In this course,
we examine the factors that made this a period of turmoil and change in the
cultures of knowledge in Europe. We shall look at the impact of printing, the
challenges to traditional academic philosophies, the conflicts between learned
and popular systems of belief, and the continuing vitality of religious and
magical thinking. As we shall discover, this was a period in which
recognizably modern ways of thinking were still entangled with beliefs in
magic, astrology, prophecy, and witchcraft. The syntheses and the struggles
between these outlooks make this a particularly fascinating period in the
history of ideas.

Assignments:** We will use a combination of lectures and discussions in this
class. Certain sessions will be set aside for discussion of the assigned
readings, and everyone will be expected to be properly prepared and to
participate. In a small class such as this, absences will certainly be noticed
and _repeated absence will adversely affect your grade_. To facilitate
discussion, you will be asked to write a short report on the assigned reading
and bring it to class. Each report will be handed in for comments but will not
be graded immediately. Instead, you will have the opportunity to revise the
reports and submit them in the form of a journal toward the end of the
semester to receive a grade. In addition to this, undergraduates will take a
midterm test and write a final research paper (using sources beyond those
assigned for the class). Graduate students will write an essay-review for the
mid-term and a final research paper, but will not take the mid-term exam. All
students will take the final exam: for undergraduates this will comprise
short-answer questions and one essay; graduate students will write two in-
class essays.

Grades will be calculated according to the following proportions:  
**654** : 6 reports on reading (30%); mid-term test (20%); final paper (20%);
final exam (20%); class participation (10%).  
**854** : 6 reports on reading (30%); monograph review (20%); final paper
(25%); final exam (25%).

> According to a study conducted by [Lilly Wong Fillmore
](http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/jwcrawford/fillmor1.htm)(1982),
language use patterns, organization for instructional activities, and the
student composition of classrooms interact to produce either high levels or
low levels of language learning. Factors stemming from the way in which
classrooms are organized for instruction are within the control of the
teacher. Situational variables, such as classroom composition, affect the
ability of students to learn a new language. Classroom composition may depend
on [program placement decisions](../Pages/SEIvCanadian.htm) or may be due to
de facto segregation or patterns of mobility and residency within communities.
Wong Fillmore found the following to be salient characteristics of classrooms
that [promote L2 learning](../LangAssessmtMMdl/Default.htm):

>

> _

>

> _![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)In classes with a wide
range of language abilities, the students were [grouped by language
ability](../ThemePlanningMMdl/Default.htm) for instruction within their
classroom. These groupings were flexible and temporary, changing according to
[learners' growing language proficiencies.](../NatApprTheory-Eng/Default.htm)

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif) Some subjects were
taught in the unfamiliar language L2, while others were [taught in familiar
language the L1](../SpanRdgPPT/Default.htm).

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)When the unfamiliar
language was used as the medium of instruction, the [teacher made special
efforts](../Pages/4X4Guidelines.htm) to use the language in a way that made it
possible for the children to [understand the content](../Lng-
Concept/Default.htm).

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)Numerous occasions each
day were provided for members of each group to [interaction with each other in
large and small group activities](../Pages/4x4activity.htm).

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)Classes were [organized
around highly-structured, teacher-directed
activities](../CsrmOrgMMdl/Default.htm). Both whole group and small group
activities were nearly always teacher directed.

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)Lessons were conducted
[_either_ in the home language _or_ in the second
language](../TransitionMMdl/Default.htm); a single lesson rarely included both
L1 and L2.

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)Students were called on
frequently to respond, either as individuals or as a group.

>

> ![reader.gif \(241 bytes\)](../Pictures/reader.gif)Teachers used the L1
occasionally during [instruction in English to explain
concepts](../ConceptsTch.htm) that could not be demonstrated non-verbally and
would otherwise be difficult to understand in L2. The home language was used
for explanation, not for translation.

> In a study of L2 learning in bilingual classrooms involving Asian and
Hispanic LEP students (Fillmore, 1982) the following were found to be
characteristics of classrooms where well over one-third of the non-English
speakers [ failed to learn English:](../SAT9analysis.htm)

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)Students
engaged in largely individualized learning activities each day.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)Learning
activities were in English, but children were interacting with one another in
their first language, using little or no English in the classroom.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)Students had
little or no direct contact with any English-speaking classmates.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)Students had
only brief, and for some students relatively infrequent, contact with the
English-speaking teacher.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)During
interaction with the teacher, students seldom said much but were able to
communicate their needs by nonverbal means.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)When
unsuccessful in communicating with the teacher, student generally turned to a
teaching assistant who was able to communicate with them in their L1.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)Students who
were unable to initiate interactions with English-speaking teacher or English-
speaking classmates generally had a hard time learning English.

>

> ![color3circls.gif \(289 bytes\)](../Pictures/color3circls.gif)When there
was a 50-50 mix of LEP and fluent English speakers, teachers modified language
input somewhat but not enough to allow children who did not know the language
well to figure out what was being said. The consequence was that the English
used instructionally was not very [useful to learners as input
data.](../TheoryBEMMdl/Default.htm)

> Assessing Language Development Programs  
>  Examining Underlying Assumptions

>

> 1\. Can the program be identified with a particular body of theory? If so,
what elements of this body of theory do you see being implemented as a
component of the program? Do you believe the program is a "faithful"
interpretation of the theory?

>

> 2\. What assumptions are made in the program about how language is best
taught to children? How is it best learned by children? At what age or stage
of cognitive development?

>

> 3\. If the program is a bilingual or L2 program, what assumptions are made
in the program about how long it takes children to acquire a second language?
What degree of proficiency are students expected to attain? For what purposes?

>

> 4\. Does the language program reflect the values and beliefs of the school
community? Does it reflect patterns of language use within the community? Does
it seek to involve parents and families in activities to support and promote
language development in the home?

>

> 5\. Within the language development program, how is language used by
teachers in the classroom? How is the language used by students? What types of
interactions are encouraged between teacher and students and/or among the
students? How are these interactions structured?

>

> 6\. Is the focus of the language program on oral language or on literacy
development or both? What is the balance between these forms of language use?
If the focus is on language in literacy, what types of instructional materials
are provided to support and enhance this type of language learning?

>

> 7\. What challenges, problems, and issues surround the language program
implemented at the district, school and/or classroom level? Are these academic
issues, program continuity issues, and/or political issues, or other type of
issue?

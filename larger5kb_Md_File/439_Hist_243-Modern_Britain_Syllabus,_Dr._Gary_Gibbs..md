![King George VI](george6.jpg)**Course Description:**

This course is a survey of the history, society, culture, and religion of
Great Britain, with a focus on England. Beginning with the advent of the Tudor
dynasty, we will examine those events and trends that led Britain to build and
lose a world empire. Readings will be based on handouts and texts available
from the internet. There is no text book assigned for this class

**Course Objectives:**

  1. To foster critical and analytical skills.
  2. To improve communication skills through class discussions and written assignments.
  3. To develop an appreciation for diverse cultures (English, Scottish, Irish, and Welsh) and their histories.
  4. To Make students aware of the evolution of British History.

** ![King Edward VIII](edw8.jpg) In order to achieve these Course Objectives,
there are the following Course Requirements:**

  1. Class attendance is **mandatory**. Excess of 3 absences will result in a lowering of the final course grade (one letter grade for each absence).
  2. There will be three in-class tests.
  3. Students are required to take a Final Examination on Friday, 11 December 1998, from 2:00 to 5:00 PM. Please note that this time slot is the LAST one in the Roanoke College Final Examination Schedule. Students should plan their holiday travels accordingly. There will be no early exams administered.
  4. Each student will deliver an oral book report to Dr. Gibbs. I will be grading for the student's ability to identify and state the author's thesis; to discuss sources and methodology; to critique the validity of the author's interpretation; and, to support their own analysis with specific facts and information.
  5. Participation is a requirement in this class. Students are expected to be engaged and interested. You are not a part of the class dialogue if you are silent. There will be occasional unannounced quizzes to test student's mastering of the readings, and the occasional homework assignment to further aid students in mastering reading assignments.
  6. In order to pass this course, all assignments must be completed.

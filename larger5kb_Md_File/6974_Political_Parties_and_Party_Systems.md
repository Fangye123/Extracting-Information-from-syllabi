**Fall Semester 1996  
G8406 Colloquium on Political Parties and Party Systems  
Professor Gerald L. Curtis  
Wednesday 2:10 - 4:00 **

This course is an intensive survey of major themes in writings about political
parties and party systems in contemporary democratic states. Course
requirements include participation in class discussions and the writing of
four essays. Students who want to receive seminar credit will be required to
write an additional seminar length research paper.

The attached syllabus includes the basic suggested readings. Students are
expected to read more widely in the relevant literature. At the beginning of
the semester students will be assigned to lead discussions of particular
topics. Details will be discussed at the first session of the course.

The themes of the four essays and the dates they are due are discussed below.
The specific focus of the essays is up to the students. These themes can be
approached in a number of ways, as we will discuss in class. Essays must be
submitted on the due date; late submissions will not be accepted. They should
be no longer than 2000 words plus bibliography.

The essays should relate to:

\--the impact of electoral system change on political party systems (due
October 2)

\--whether technological and economic developments have rendered obsolete the
conventional conception of the "modern" political party (due October 30)

\--whether parties are in decline (due November 13)

\--the role parties play in government policy making (due November 27)

Readings are on reserve in the Lehman library. A second set of readings is
available outside my office, 915 IAB for students who want to make
photocopies.

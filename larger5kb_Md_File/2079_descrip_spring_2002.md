**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
  
---  
  
Over the century and a half since California was forcibly incorporated into
the United States, it has  exercised a powerful role upon the imagination and
reality of every generation. California has been, at once, the golden gate of
opportunity and the grapes of wrath of the downtrodden, social mobility and
the policy of incarceration, the glamour of Hollywood and monotony of tract
housing, the high-tech of Silicon Valley and the high-sweat of agricultural
labor, the eden of natural bounty and the ecological disaster of sprawl and
smog. From the beginning, California's complex interplay between historical
image and reality has been heavily racialized.

This course concentrates on the historical role that categories of race have
played in defining by whose means, to whose benefit, and in whose image
California's wealth would be produced and consumed. As an intermediate-level
history course, California Dreams, California Nightmares offers a mix of
primary and secondary sources, emphasizes the interaction of multiple causal
factors, and encourages students to interpret and to write analytical
historical arguments. It is also designed to fulfill the Temple University
Studies in Race requirement. In addition to discussion, lecture, and common
readings, methods of instruction in the course include use of a computer-
assisted classroom to provide image and text projections, video clips, and
internet linkages.

California history and examines their consequences in social terms with
particular emphasis upon matters of race and class:  the Gold Rush; national
incorporation via agribusiness and urban-industrial growth; World War II;
postwar mass consumer and entertainment society; and the era of
cybercapitalism and globalization.

**Writing**

Students will write five three-page essays based upon the course reading and
classes throughout the semester as well as one five-page take-home final exam
essay.  Students may write more than five of the three-page essays, in which
case the highest five will count toward the course grade.  
---|---

**Classroom Work**

Through the medium of a computer-assisted classroom, the course will place an
emphasis upon integrating visual perceptions of California with the historical
issues raised in reading, lecture, and discussion.  Films, advertising, and
photography have long offered depictions of California life that the course
will examine, comparing stereotypical imagery with historical social
realities.

**Grades**  
---  
  
Attendance and participation together make up a fifth of the course grade.
Attendance at all classes and regular participation in class discussion are
essential, both for the life of the course and for obtaining a desirable
grade.  Missing more than two classes for whatever reason may make it
impossible to complete this course.  The five three-page essays count 50
percent of course grade while the final is weighted at 30 percent.   Students
must complete all assignments in order to gain credit for History R164/LAS
R138.

Blackboard

This course will operate through Temple's Blackboard computer system, using
the following parts:

  * Course Information--this descriptive document;
  * Announcements--a place where Prof. Schmidt will post announcements from time to time;
  * Course Documents--the sequences of class topics, internet links, and tasks that the course follows across the semester; Course Documents includes a Class Archive, a repository of material from different classes that may be reviewed again later (PowerPoint software desirable);
  * Assignments--where Prof. Schmidt will post the three-page paper assignments and the final;
  * E-mail and External Links allow communication among members of the class and reference to outside internet sources.

_Important note:_ Students must have a Temple astro e-mail account in order to
become enrolled in Blackboard. (Once they enrolled in Blackboard, students may
then modify its settings so that they can participate through another account
--e.g. aol).  Students without an astro account should obtain one immediately
via the Computer Center in Wachman Hall or on-line (go to
**<http://www.temple.edu/cs>** and click on  "Activate Account" under
"Accounts" in the left margin).  In either case, an astro account is both easy
to acquire and free of charge.  Students can find a guide to Blackboard at the
Computer Help Desk in Wachman or on-line at
**<http://www.temple.edu/cs/blackboard/studentguide.html> **.

Students should be aware that Blackboard, like all computer systems, has its
moments of failure. To provide backup, both Course Information and Course
Documents are also located on Prof. Schmidt's website:
**<http://astro.temple.edu/~arturo>** . Students should be aware that the
malfunction of any aspect of computer systems cannot be accepted as a
legitimate excuse for incompletion of any course requirements.

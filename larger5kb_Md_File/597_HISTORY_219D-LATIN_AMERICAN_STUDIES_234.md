###  **Course Description**

HIST 219D/LASC 234 is an interdisciplinary introduction to the peoples and
cultures of Latin America. Using the multimedia _Americas_ series, the course
will explore the complexities of Latin American civilization as lived by Latin
Americans, and the various ways in which Latin American civilization can be
studied in an academic setting.

HIST 219D/LASC 234 is crosslisted with SPAN 234/PORT 234. All courses fulfill
CORE requirements for CORE Humanities (HO) and Diversity (D). The course also
fulfills the requirements for the Latin American Studies Certificate Program.
For additional information on the Program, visit their website at:

<http://www.inform.umd.edu/LAS/program/certificate.html>  
    


**Course Organization:**

There are three main components to the course:

1) Two weekly lecture-discussions devoted to problems raised in the assigned
readings  
2) One weekly discussion section devoted to problems raised in the video
screenings  
3) One weekly video screening

All students are expected to fully participate in all aspects of the course.  
    


**Course Requirements:**

A pass/fail **Map Quiz** will be given in class on Wednesday, September 15,
1999.  (Revised) You will have up to three opportunities pass the map quiz
(seven or more correct identifications). See the [Map Quiz Study
Sheet](http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/ARHU/Depts/History/Faculty/DWilliams/Fall99/HIST219D/mapstudy.html)
for more information.

Each Monday, from Week IV through Week XIV, all students will be required to
turn in a brief (1-2 page) **Critique of the Weekly Video Assignment. The**
critiques will be graded pass/fail. The videos will be screened on Dial Access
in Hornbake Non-Print Media the week prior to the due date. (Example: the
video to be discussed in Week IV, _The Conflict of the Gods,_ should be viewed
some time during Week III.) For more information, see the [Video Screening
Schedule](video.html").

The [Take-Home Midterm](midterm.html), due at the beginning of lecture on
Monday, October 25, 1999, will cover the materials presented during the first
half of the course. The midterm questions will be distributed in class one
week prior to the exam.

The **Final Project** , due Wednesday, December 15, will be an internet-based
assignment in which you develop a multimedia unit using materials from the
_Americas_ series and outside materials. For more information see the Final
Project
[webpage](http://www.inform.umd.edu/HIST/Faculty/DWilliams/Fall99/HIST219D/finalproject/index.html).

A two-hour **Final Examination** will be given on Wednesday, December 22, at
10:30am. The final will cover materials presented during the second half of
the course. The study questions are available on-line, Cleck
[here](final.hthl).  
    


**Grading** :

Final grades will be determined by the following formula:

5%       Map Quiz  
10%     Video Critiques  
20%     Midterm Examination  
25%     Final Project  
20%     Final Examination  
20%     Participation*

With the exception of legitimate excuses, late papers may be penalized one
full grade for every day late. Late video critiques will not be accepted.

All University regulations concerning academic dishonesty will be strictly
enforced. Violation of these codes may result in a failing grade and/or
referral to a University disciplinary committee. Should you have _ANY_
questions or doubts about citation and attribution, please see the professor.

*Attendance is mandatory. Excessive absences will lower your participation grade. Active participation in discussion section, on the other hand, will work in your favor should your final grade fall on a borderline.

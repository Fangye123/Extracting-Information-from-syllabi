"If you are a political person 
      and do not study history, your politics will provoke chaos, anarchy and 
      repression. If you are a political person and study history, your politics 
      will provoke disillusion, apathy and cynicism. So the question is: whether 
      to ignore history and be jailed or learn its lessons and be impotent. What 
      a choice!"
Jules Feiffer



What follows is a list of courses, with brief descriptions, that I teach at 
  Oberlin College. They are not all taught every year. Clicking on the title will 
  take you to the current or most recent syllabus with a longer course description, 
  requirements, class schedule and readings. Most of the information for courses 
  I am currently teaching can be found on Blackboard. 
  There you can find another copy of the syllabus, announcements and alerts for 
  changes in the course, assignments, and links to some useful web sites. Similarly, 
  readings for all my classes are on ERes 
  (electronic reserve), where you will need a password to access material that 
  has been scanned into portable document format (PDF). For both the documents 
  in CourseInfo and the readings on ERes, you will need the Adobe Acrobat Reader 
  installed on your computer. You can get it free from Adobe. 
  Lastly, clicking here will take you to an annotated 
  list of links that are often useful supplements to my courses. 


Politics 114. West European 
    Politics: Left and Right in Transition 
 This introductory course surveys contemporary politics in four European 
    countries: Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. Attention will be given both 
    to the ways in which the character and content of politics is shaped by particular 
    patterns of historical development, and to recent political changes in each 
    country, such as German unification. The course will also examine the process 
    of European political and economic integration, and the structures and institutions 
    being created at the European level. Limit: 60. No prerequisite. Three credit 
    hours. Next taught: Fall 2001.



Politics 111. Colloquium: 
    What's Left? Left Governments In Power in Europe And North America

 Currently, political parties of the center-left are in power in much of 
    Western Europe and North America. These governments have sought to distinguish 
    themselves from earlier Left governments using labels such as "New Democrats," 
    "The Third Way" and "Die Neue Mitte." This course examines 
    the experience of the contemporary Left in power, in order to evaluate what 
    Left governance means today. Students will write research papers and undertake 
    class projects using online resources. Limit: 15 No prerequisite. Three credit 
    hours. Next taught: 2002-2003.



Politics 213. Theory and Practice of the European 
    Left 
 This course focuses upon the different forms of left-wing parties and movements 
    in Western Europe. It is concerned both with the theoretical and ideological 
    underpinnings of left-wing political action, and concrete cases of political 
    organization in opposition to the dominant economic and political structures 
    of capitalist democracy. The course will examine socialism, social democracy, 
    communism, identity politics, and new social movements through the study of 
    various political parties and social movements in Europe. Limit 30 No prerequisite. 
    Three credit hours. Next taught: unknown.



 Politics 216. The Political 
    Economy of Advanced Capitalism
This course is an introduction to comparative political economy, broadly 
    defined as the ways in which the triangular relationship between the state, 
    labor and capital differs from one advanced capitalist country to another. 
    The course will examine the political economies of Britain, France, Germany, 
    Sweden, the US, and Japan, and it will focus upon a number of important themes 
    such as the welfare state, urban political economy, and the globalization 
    of the world economy. Limit: 30. No prerequisite. Three credit hours. Next 
    taught: Fall 2001.



Politics 219. Work, Workers 
    and Trade Unions in Advanced Capitalist Societies   
 This course examines the nature and organization of work in capitalist societies, 
    and the forms of labor organization created by workers. It is a comparative 
    course, looking at Western Europe, Japan, and the United States. Among the 
    topics covered are: conflict and cooperation in the workplace, the intersection 
    of race, class and gender at work, types of trade unionism, the labor process, 
    the role of the state and employers in industrial relations, and labor politics. 
    Limit: 30. No prerequisite. Three credit hours. Next 
    taught: 2002-2003.



Politics 310. Seminar: 
    Topics in Comparative Politics (team-taught)
How should we study politics in other countries? What tools exist for doing 
    so? Which are most appropriate for studying particular problems? Readings 
    and discussion will focus on the leading approaches, including political economy, 
    political sociology (class, gender and race), institutionalism, culture, and 
    history. Students will apply these tools by writing and presenting a research 
    paper on a topic of their choice. Faculty will present their own research 
    in progress. Limit: 15. Prerequisite: consent of the instructors. Three credit 
    hours. Next taught: Spring 2002.



Politics 315. Seminar: 
    The Future of Organized Labor 
This seminar examines the challenges facing labor movements in advanced capitalist 
    societies today, and the ways in which workers and trade unions are responding 
    to those challenges. We will look at organized labor in Western Europe, the 
    United States, and Japan, and explore issues such as economic restructuring, 
    new management strategies, free trade, changes in the composition of the working 
    class, particularly the feminization of work, and new union organizing and 
    political strategies. Limit: 15. Prerequisite: consent of the instructor. 
    Three credit hours. Next taught: Spring 2002.

 **1.** ** _Student Profile_** - **3 points**  
  
Each student will complete a student profile of a student they are working
with. The profile will contain: demographic information (first names only); a
brief description of the student (including functioning level, likes/dislikes,
any other observed information that may be helpful in the development of the
student's IEP); any assessment data that you may want to include (not

Each student is required to write a lesson plan. With the emphasis on
coordinating the instruction of students with disabilities with the Standards
of Learning, the lesson plan will be directly linked to a specific SOL. For
example, you may cite Grade 1 Mathematics, Number and Number Senses, 1.1 - The
student will count objects in a given set containing between 10-100 objects
and write the corresponding numeral. Then you would develop a lesson
addressing this SOL. Your lesson must be consistent with the format presented
in class.

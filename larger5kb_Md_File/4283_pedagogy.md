Professor elin o'Hara slavick \- Office/Studio: Hanes 312, 962-0216  
ART 068, SPRING, 1997 Hanes Art Center, Photo Studio, 316, Tu +Th: 2:15-4:50

This class is designed for serious art majors who wish to pursue their own
projects through a close analysis and exploration of black and white
photographic processes, formally and conceptually. The use of all technically
possible and theoretically appropriate media is encouraged. We will organize a
group exhibition  of the class work towards the end of the semester. We will
have several group critiques and many slide/video/film presentations of
historical and contemporary photography and art that deal with issues
surrounding documentary and art photography, the body, sexuality, dreams,
identity, politics, memory,  narratives, race, class, gender, and
psychoanalysis. I will meet with each student individually on Tuesday,
February 25, during a  lab class. Feel free to sign up for additional
meetings. My undergraduate office hours are Wednesdays 3:00-5:00 and the sign
up sheets are posted on the bulletin board across the hall from my studio. You
must sign up by Tuesday at 5 p.m.  There will be required readings on reserve
in The Sloan Art Library which we will discuss in class. Please keep the
reserve folder in order. If you plan to make copies of the readings, please
copy ALL of the readings at one time and return them to their proper order. I
have numbered the readings with a bold black marker from start to finish.
There is also a suggested/recommended reading list at the end of this
syllabus. **On Photography** , by Susan Sontag, **Camera Lucida** by Roland
Barthes, and **Two or Three Things I Know For Sure** by Dorothy Allison are
the   required book purchases and are available at The Internationalist
Bookstore, 405 W. Franklin. 7 copies of Carol Mavor's Pleasures Taken are also
at the Internationalist, for this class as recommended reading.  
    
 You will have a mid-term exam based on the readings and on in-class
slide/video/film presentations.  
**    * Mid-term exam - Tuesday, March 4. ***  
 As a final exam you are required to respond to at least two of the readings
AND two photographer/artists with one of the following, due on Tuesday, April
15:  
 1) a 4 page, typed, double-spaced paper. Good reproductions are required.  
 2) a 15 minute presentation. Good slides are required.  
 3) a photographic project in response  
    
 You are strongly encouraged to bring in relevant visual and reading materials
to class. We will see an exhibition, collection and/or performance/film as a
group and will try to have a visiting artist come to one of the critiques.
Your grade will be based on your participation in all group discussions,
attendance, your approach to and completion of all  
assignments, including exams, your close reading of all assigned readings, and
your contribution to the class as a whole. I grade each project, both exams,
and every class discussion individually. If you are concerned about your
grade, it is your responsibility to  sign up for a meeting. If you must miss a
class due to an emergency, please notify me before class. More than two
unexplained absences will result in the lowering of your final grade by half a
grade.  
Your grade: Projects: 50%.  Participation: 30%.  EXAMS 20%.

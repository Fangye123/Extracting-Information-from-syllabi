Aim:

To enable the students to understand the history and development of technology and material culture.

Learning Outcomes:

Upon successful completion of this course, the learner will have demonstrated the ability to:

8. Know the origins, sources, processing, products, manufacture, construction methods, fabrication and design of the materials and objects made of wood, leather and proteinaceous materials.

9. Know the origins, history and development of the technologies and manufacturing processes of objects made of wood, leather and proteinaceous materials.

10. Research objects, materials and technologies of wood, leather and proteinaceous materials using a variety of media and methods.

Course Format:
This course is one of four courses listed in the "super module" of Conservation and Material Science II.  Courses in this frame work are linked tightly together, are interdependent to each other, and are foundation courses for the program.

This course will consist of 1 hour of scheduled lecture per week.  Lecture time may be subject to occasional adjustment in order to fit in with field trips, community based projects, group projects or guest lectures and/or workshops.

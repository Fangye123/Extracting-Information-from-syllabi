**Class Participation**

You are expected to arrive in class on time and be prepared to enter into
discussion of the previously assigned subject matter. Attendance _per se_
should not be equated with class participation. "Class participation" is
active, knowledgeable, thoughtful and constructive contributions to the
subject matter assigned and/or under discussion. Lack of attendance would
necessarily lower the "class participation" grade since one cannot make the
forgoing contributions when not present. Excessive absences, disruptions of
the class or a failure to contribute to the class will result in a
significantly lowered participation grade and perhaps even failure of the
course. Class participation should be viewed as an opportunity to learn
important workplace skills such as teamwork, public speaking, persuasive
writing and the presentation of thoughful ideas.

**Quizzes and Mini-Projects**

You will regularly have "five-minute" quizzes on class work assigned for or
covered during the class period and in-class assignments for which there will
not be any make up. However, your lowest quiz grade will be dropped in
computing the final average. Additional quizzes or assignments may be
delivered on-line over the web.. There will be a few mini-projects such as
interviewing an entrepreneur and writing a case history of the entrepreneur's
company, analyzing an opportunity and assessing a colleague's business plan.
Also, you will be expected to keep an Ideal Log book that will be turned in
twice during the course upon request of the instructor.

**Business Plan Project**

Students will work in teams of two to develop a comprehensive 12-15 page
business plan for an innovative high-technology product or service. The
product or service selected for your team's business plan must be approved
(initialed) by the instructor in advance. The final product must be delivered
to the instructor by 5:00 PM on Monday, April 15 so that your business plan
can be posted on a web page for assessment by your peers. A video-taped
presentation of the business plan by your team will be part of the grade for
this project. See _**Projects**_ on the left side of the CSIS 4490 Home Page
for more details.

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY**

Every KSU student is responsible for upholding the provisions of the Student
Code of Conduct as published in the Undergraduate Catalog. Section 11 of the
Student Code of Conduct addresses the University's policy on academic honesty,
including provisions regarding plagiarism and cheating, unauthorized access to
university materials, misrepresentation/falsification of university records or
academic work, malicious removal, retention or destruction of library
materials, malicious/intentional misuse of computer facilities an/or services
and misuse of student identification cards. Incidents of alleged academic
misconduct will be handled through established procedures of the University
Judiciary Program, which includes either an "informal" resolution by a faculty
member, resulting in a grade adjustment, or a formal hearing procedure, which
may subject a student to the Code of Conduct's minimum one semester suspension
requirement. Two incidents of academic dishonesty will result in an automatic
F in this course.

Belligerent, abusive, profane, threatening and/or inappropriate behavior on
the part of a student is a violation of the Kennesaw State University Student
Conduct Regulations. Students who are found guilty of such misconduct may be
subject to immediate dismissal from the institution. In addition, these
violations of state law may also be subject to criminal action beyond the
University disciplinary process.

**STUDENT EVALUATION OF COURSE**

A standard questionnaire (described below) will be administered during the
last two weeks of the semester in all classes. Additional questions developed
by the college or instructor(s) may be included as well. It is important that
each student provide meaningful feedback to the instructor(s) so that changes
can be made in the course to continually improve its effectiveness. We value
student feedback about the course, our teaching styles, and course materials,
so as to improve our teaching and your learning. At a minimum, the following
two questions will be asked: 1) Identify the aspects of the course that most
contributed to your learning (include examples of specific materials,
exercises and/or the faculty member's approach to teaching and mentoring), and
2) Identify the aspects of the course, if any, that might be improved (include
examples of specific materials, exercises and/or the faculty member's approach
to teaching and mentoring). Additionally, in the context of the Learning
Outcomes for the course, you will be asked how well these were accomplished
and in what ways were the Learning Outcomes not realized? Also, I will want to
know if you would recommend this course to another student in your degree
program and whether you would recommend this instructor to another student in
your degree program.

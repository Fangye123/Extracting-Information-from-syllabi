**PLA options and contact for this couse:**

**Academic Responsibilities:**

**Mandatory Requirements**

1\. The Art Conservation Laboratory is to be locked at all times, when not in
use. Failure to lock the lab will result in the loss of unscheduled access.

2\. Students will work in the laboratory with at least one other person (i.e.
the "buddy" system).

3\. Eating, drinking and smoking are not permitted in the laboratory.

4\. Students will not be allowed access to the laboratory under the influence
of alcohol and narcotics.

5\. EACH STUDENT HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF PRACTISING SAFE LABORATORY
PROCEDURES.

6\. Artifacts and course supplies will not be permitted to leave the
laboratory.

7\. It is the student's responsibility to label and identify any personal
equipment or related belongings.

8\. Students are required to store personal belongings such as coats, boots
etc. in their lockers.

9\. Students will respect all artifacts and projects thereby not handling any
treatments in progress, other than their own, unless given permission to do
so.

10\. Students are not permitted to use personal property as projects to be
evaluated.

11\. Students will record unscheduled time spent in the laboratory in the "lab
log". Attendance will be monitored during scheduled lab time, failure to work
under the direct supervision of faculty may result in the suspension of lab
privileges.

**Course Policies**

Projects will be evaluated upon the successful completion of the artifact
treatment, and when all written and photographic documentation is submitted.
Failure to provide all necessary documentation will jeopardize the evaluation
process. Students must complete all course assignments in order to receive a
passing grade.

Late assignments will be penalized 10 % per day. The instructor reserves the
right to remove artifacts from students if a treatment is not progressing
consistently, a grade of zero will be given. The CCM program has adopted the
attached policy on late assignments. Exceptions may be granted due to
circumstances beyond the student's control, provided that the student contacts
the instructor promptly upon return to the College to discuss alternate
arrangements.

**_Collections Conservation and Management_**

1\. _Presentation_

Written assignments must be:

  * typed or word-processed
  * double spaced
  * proofed for spelling and grammatical errors
  * enclosed with a single cover sheet which includes student name, title of the assignment and date of submission
  * stapled in the top left hand corner (unbound) and
  * include a bibliography (where appropriate)
  * use a recognized method of citation (eg: MLA or Chicago)

**_2\. Re-writes_**

Faculty may request a re-write of a submission if the criteria for assessment
have not been met. Late penalties will apply if the assignment is not re-
submitted the following day.

**_3\. Penalties for Late Submissions_**

The Collections Conservation Management Program recognizes the departmental
policy developed by Community Services.

**_Completion of Term Work_**

All assignments must be completed in order for students to achieve a passing
grade.

**_Late Assignments_**

Late assignments receive the following penalty:

Marks will be deducted at the rate of 10% per day for three days after which
assignments are marked at zero.

Faculty are not obliged to provide feedback on assignments marked at zero.

**_Oral Presentations_**

Oral presentations and/or practical or projects for evaluation must be
delivered on the day scheduled. A 'no-show' will be graded at zero unless
adequate explanation is provided.

**_4\. Academic Integrity_**

Plagiarism is a serious breach of academic integrity and the college has a
strict policy on this issue (see Academic Regulations).

It is a student's responsibility to ensure that all written submissions
include an appropriate method of in text citation as well as an accompanying
bibliography.

Seminar and oral presentations should be supported by a bibliography and
sources should be referred to during the presentation.

**_5\. Make-up Tests_**

In valid circumstances (ill-health, personal crisis), a student may be given a
make-up test to compensate for one missed in class-time. Students must contact
the instructor within seven days of the original test in order to request a
make-up.

**_6\. Extensions & GDFS_**

An extension may be granted to an individual student based on need and
circumstance. Medical grounds should be substantiated.

The revised due date will be recorded and signed by both parties.

The entire class may be given an extension, at the discretion of faculty.

Incomplete and Grade Deferred marks at the end of the semester must be
negotiated between student and faculty (see Academic Regulations). Note: these
are a privilege to be granted under special circumstances, not used in order
to compensate for poor planning.

**_7\. Site Work_**

Students must agree to work within the parameters of the guidelines
established for site work. Failure to comply, may result in the termination of
project and suspension of the privilege of access.

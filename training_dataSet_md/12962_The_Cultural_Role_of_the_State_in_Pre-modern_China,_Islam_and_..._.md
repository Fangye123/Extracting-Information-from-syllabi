1\. Schedule

     We meet as a weekly seminar on Fridays from 1:30 to 4:20 (except that we will have to fix an alternative time and perhaps place for Friday February 26).  We'll have a ten-minute break around 3:00. 

2\. Scope of course

     It is sometimes said that pre-modern states practiced "minimal government", and they undoubtedly tended to exert much less power over their societies than typical modern states. Nevertheless, they were remarkably varied in the authority they exercised over their subjects, and in the aspects of their lives which they made it their business to shape or control.   
     This course is concerned the extent to which pre-modern states exercised authority over the cultures of their societies. To make the subject manageable, we will limit our primary focus to three exemplary cases: T'ang China (seventh to ninth centuries), the Caliphate (seventh to tenth centuries), and the Roman Empire (Augustus to Justinian).  The aspects of culture which will mainly concern us are law, historiography, belles lettres, and religion.   
     As we proceed, a pattern of strong contrasts between our three cases will emerge.  The problem, to which I do not at this point have an answer, is to explain these contrasts. 

3\. Course requirements

     (1) Class participation (25%).  We will spend a good deal of time in close discussion of texts you have read in advance, and of wider issues raised in the reading and lectures.  Your preparation and participation is vital. 

     (2) Oral presentation (20%).  After the first couple of   
weeks, I will assign each of you to make one or more oral presentations.
These will be short (10 to 15 minutes), and will typically involve reading up
on an issue of which the class will already have some background knowledge.  A
good oral presentation does not ramble or repeat itself, and does not present
undigested facts one after the other.  It is tightly organized and strongly
focussed; listeners know exactly where you are going during the presentation,
and are left at the end with a clear idea of what you have said.

     (3) Three short essays (30%).  An essay should be about 1000 words long; use a normal font-size and double-spacing.  Late essays will be heavily penalized (a grade a day).  For a schedule of essay questions and deadlines, and some guidelines for writing essays, see below. 

     (4) Term paper (25%).  This paper should be about 5000 words long; you should concentrate on delivering the goods, in a concise and organized fashion, and avoid prolixity.  Topics are a matter of negotiation between student and instructor.  On or before Friday April 2, you must submit a one-page statement of your proposed topic.  A topic should be comparative, and should involve independent research taking you more deeply into some part of the ground covered in the course; in exceptional cases, the focus of the paper may be on places and times not covered in the course, provided always that the themes are those of the course.  The paper is due by the Dean's date in May. 

     There is no variance of the course requirements for Seniors. 

4\. Required reading

     All the required reading for the course is contained in the HUM 430 Sourcebook, which will be available at the beginning of the semester at Pequod (6 Nassau Street).   
     The table of contents of the Sourcebook tells you what you have to read when.  The gross amount of reading is not that much; what is essential is that you read closely, think about what you read, and are ready to discuss it in class.  Where short texts from primary sources are included, you should pay particularly close attention to them.   
     If you are able to purchase the Sourcebook before the beginning of the semester, it would be well worth your while to read the introductory historical surveys which serve as background to the periods and places we will be concerned with.   
     Note that there is reading to be done for the first meeting.

6\. Essays: questions and deadlines

1\. Due February 26

     From the topics you have studied so far, what patterns of similarity and difference emerge with regard to the cultural role of the state in T'ang China, the Islamic world under Caliphate, and the Roman Empire? 

2\. Due March 26

     Does the material you have studied so far suggest that there are some aspects of a culture which a pre-modern state is more likely to attempt to shape or control than others, and, if so, why is it so? 

3\. Due April 16

     What explanation can you offer of the differences between T'ang China, the Islamic world under Caliphate, and the Roman Empire with regard to the cultural role of the state? 

     The essays presuppose that you have done the reading for all previous seminars, together with that set for the seminar at which the essay is due. 

     Here is a check-list of some of the key points to consider   
before you hand in an essay:

     (1) Have you answered the question (and not some other question, or no question in particular)?   
     (2) Have you organized your argument in the most effective way you can (or does it meander all over the place?)   
     (3) Have you backed up every general claim you make with a concrete example?   
     (4) Have you made effective use of the primary sources to the extent that they are available in the Sourcebook?  (You should normally use short, pithy quotations, rather than long displayed ones.)   
     (5) Does your opening paragraph give the reader a clear sense of the way you see the question and how you are going to set about answering it?   
     (6) Does a reader who looks through the body of the essay reading only the first and last sentences of each paragraph get a clear sense of what each paragraph is about and what it achieves?   
     (7) Does your concluding paragraph effectively sum up what you have done to answer the question?   
     (8) Have you said at least two things in the course of the essay that are passably smart? 

7\. Communication

     You can e-mail me at any time (mcook@princeton.edu).  My office is 101A Jones Hall, and I will post my regular office hours there at the start of the semester.

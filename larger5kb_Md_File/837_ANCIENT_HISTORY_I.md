.   **THE COURSE.  ** During this semester, we will study the development of
western civilization from its humble beginnings in Near Eastern farming
villages more than 10,000 years ago to the opulent Hellenistic civilization
fostered by the conquests of Alexander the Great.  We will start when
humankind emerged from cave shelters to sow crops and domesticate animals, to
build cities, and to devise the complex system of social relationships we call
civilization. We will see how the invention of writing allows us to observe
the systems of government, society, and laws of the ancients. We will note the
formation of states, nations and empires in a repeating cycle that recurs with
infinite variations over and over throughout the brief period of humankind's
recorded history. There will also be a strong emphasis on the art and
archaeology of the ancient world--the physical and visual evidence which each
civilization has left behind--and what they tell us about that society's
tastes and beliefs. This course will try to demonstrate how similar we are in
many ways to our ancient relatives, and how our basic characteristics as a
species remain unchanged. Due to the span of time we examine, we will be
moving quickly from one period to another, and the effect may at times be
confusing.  Ask questions...let me know what is baffling or overwhelming.  The
ancient world is at once familiar and mysterious, and the gaps in our
knowledge of it allow for broad interpretation. I hope that this course will
get you to think and to analyze, to question "facts" and to develop your own
opinions, for these are the true benefits of studying history.     **This
course satisfies the General Education requirement in Historical
Perspectives.**  
---  
.   **THE BOOKS.  ** Our basic modern texts for this course are:  
**_     Knapp = _**A. B. Knapp. _The History and Culture of Ancient Western
Asia & Egypt. _4th ed., Chicago, 1988.  
**_     Martin = _** __ Thomas Martin. _Ancient Greece.   _Yale Univ. Press.
1996.  
We will also examine original sources from:  
**_     Bailkey = _**N.M. Bailkey. _Readings in Ancient History._ Lexington,
Mass. 5th ed., 1996.  
---  
.   **INTERNET RESOURCES:** During this semester you should become familiar
with the course Web Page
(http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~murray/classes/ah/ah_01f.htm).   The syllabus,
supplementary readings, study aids, and study guides for the exams will be
posted on the web page.  In general, I will also use the web page to
communicate with you between classes and to post changes in the course
schedule and assignments.  It would be a good idea to check the course web
page regularly for updates.  Bookmark it!  
---  
.   **REQUIREMENTS:** There will be **three exams**. Exam #1 =20% of your
grade, Exam #2 =20%, Exam#3 =40%.   In order to "help" you keep up with your
reading assignments, there will be **brief quizzes** at the beginning of
selected class periods (roughly once a week). The quizzes will be of a general
nature and **will cover material from the readings assigned in the syllabus
_for that week._**   Quizzes and class participation account for 20% of your
course grade. Attendance forms a significant portion of the grade and is a
vital part of your commitment to doing well in this course, as there are
important concepts and issues that will be presented only in class.  
---  
.   **POLICY ON MAKEUP EXAMS:** Students who miss an **exam** will be allowed
to make up the exam only if they provide the instructor with acceptable
documentation explaining their absence. The student must inform me _prior_ to
the time of the exam, unless extreme circumstances prevent this (you may do
this by e-mail or by leaving a voice-mail message at the above number,
specifically directed to me).   The makeup exam must be taken during the week
following the missed exam, except under extreme circumstances. Makeup exams
are typically more demanding than regular exams.  **Quizzes** may be made up
with an excused absence, at the instructor's discretion.   To be eligible to
make up a quiz, contact me (preferably by email) as soon as possible and prior
to your return to class.  You must take the quiz at the _beginning_ of the
next class you attend (or by prior arrangement).

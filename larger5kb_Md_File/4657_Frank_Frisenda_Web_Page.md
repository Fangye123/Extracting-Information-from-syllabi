### Personal Information:

Hello, I am the co-ordinator for the General Science Studies (GSS)and the
Multi-Disciplinary Science (MDS)courses here at Nassau. If you need any
information regarding these courses, please do not hesitate to contact me. You
may visit me during my office hours. I can also be reached in the Academic
Advisement Center on Thursdays from 1-215. In addition, I teach the following
courses, "Science of Our World" (GSS111)and "Multi-Disciplinary Science - A
Macroscopic Approach" (MDS101). I think these courses offer an interesting
alternative to the traditional science courses. They are both 4 credit lab
sciences that satisfy NCC graduation requirements and transfer to other SUNY
campuses as Gen-Ed requirements.

### Professional Information:

I have my Master of Science degree in Technological Systems Management from
SUNY Stony Brook. That is a fancy way of saying, "use the computer for
modeling various environmental systems to get a better understanding of "what
if" scenerios and use the Internet to evaluate the credibility of information.
To get a better understanding of my life, you can see below that I am the
faculty advisor for several clubs on campus including:  

####  Concrete Canoe Club:

We have students from all across the campus. We build and race canoes made of
concrete and steel in competions with other colleges that do the same. Hmmm!
In addition, we go on both autumn and summer wilderness canoe / camping trips.
So come along.  

#### Environmental Technology and Awareness Club:

This is intended for students that want to participate in a variety of
environmental or outdoor activities including camping, hiking, conoeing,
birdwatching, recycling efforts. We even maintain our own bird sanctuary here
on campus.  

> So, needless to say, I am an outdoors enthusiast and I participate in the
NYS Wildlife Rehabilitation program.

### Course Syllabus

Science of Our World: GSS 111  
This is an introductory laboratory science course designed for the
nontechnically oriented student who desires an understanding of the
capabilities, characteristics and methods of our modern technological society.
Contemporary problems and issues are discussed as follows:  
1\. History of Science: Indo-European vs. Semite/Christian, Greek, Roman,
European  
2\. Modern Science: Scientific methodology, Epidemiological vs. Controlled
experiment  
3\. Demographics/Decision Making:  
* Population dynamics, resource use, explore gender/ethnic roles  
* Darwin, genetics, resources, predator/prey relationships  
4\. Principles of Ecology:  
* Protons, Neutrons, Electrons, etc.  
* Heat and Thermal pollution  
* Formation of the Universe, Forces, Galaxies, Stars, Planets  
* Formation of Water - to modern day water quality issues  
* Formation of Atmosphere - to modern day air quality issue  
* Formation of Continents - to modern day plate tectonics, modern day tertiary issues  
* Decision making, evaluate gender/ethnic relationships within the social construction of wilderness and ecology  
5\. Labs: Wet lab and computer simulations are used for the lab component.

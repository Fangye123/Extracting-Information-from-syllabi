# **INTRODUCTION TO HUMAN POPULATION**

Sociology 222b, Spring 1993  
Department of Sociology and Anthropology  
Bowdoin College

Meeting times: MWF 11:00-12:00  
Location: Cleaveland 123  
Instructor: **Nancy Riley**  
Office: 2nd Floor, Ashby House Ext: 3636  
Office hours: MW: 3-4:15 PM ; T: 1:30-3:00 and by appointment  

This course will introduce students to the study of human populations from a
sociological perspective. The course will deal only very superficially with
demographic methods and I assume no previous training in statistics. Although
we will touch on the consequences of population change, especially as we
discuss population policies, the course will focus on the processes of
population change -- fertility, mortality and migration -- and on the reasons
for demographic change. We will read a number of classic and more recent
readings from the population field, as well as selected critiques of
population research and policies.

What's new at this site.

        1. New Resource Page for Environmental Justice and Ecological Education created by Leanne Jablonski and Jennifer Mansfield of the Marianist Environmental Education Center, <http://www.udayton.edu/~meec/ESAEJ2.html>

        2. HELP Improve This Page! Here are some things I would like YOU to consider committing to do: 

          1. **WWW Ecology Course Syllabus Exchange.** Volunteer to contribute the URL to your ecology course web page, or volunteer to search the web for the pages of your colleagues' pages (and get their permission...). Interested? 

          2. **What constitutes Ecological Literacy?** Can we articulate the set of learning goals and curriculum objectives that "students should be able to do" if they are _"ecologically literate"_? What guidance or generalities can we provide, if any, to the teachers of millions of college and pre-college students in easy reach via the www AS WELL AS those who lack the privilege of ample www access? What have other groups of educators concluded (such as the NAAEE, NISE, NAS, AAAS, NSTA)? Interested in participating in this effort?  
  
     Ken Klemow has proposed "A FIRST CUT" of "ELEVEN BASIC ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS" that students should understand (see site1:<http://wilkes1.wilkes.edu/~kklemow/basic-lit.html>) or (see site2:[http://pop1.science.widener.edu/~grant/esa/edweb/resources/kens-basic-lit.html](edweb/resources/kens-basic-lit.html)). What do you think?

          3. **Ecological Educator Mentorship Program.** We need a way to create a network of skilled ecological educators willing to mentor novice teachers (from pre-college, to graduate students, to assistant professors, to others who find themselves teaching ecology with little if any ecological background). There are over 500 Education Section members - can we organize and calibrate mentors from our ranks? Interested?**

          4. **Ecology 101 on the EdWeb.** I need someone commit to navigating the ESA main site four times per year and organizing and annotating a bookmark and cached file list of the Ecology 101 articles that Harold Ornes has been collecting, editing and publishing in the Bulletin faithfully for years - thanks Harold. I would then link to your page from the EdWeb. Interested in taking this on? 

          5. **Textbook and Environmental Education Curriculum Reviews.** When the Section was founded, there was tremendous interest in ecology textbooks. I would like to see this issue resurrected and organized - especially for pre-college books and ecological educational materials. Interested?

          6. **Ecological Educational $Development Resource Page.** A page that summarizes all of the major funding opportunities (public and private, national and regional) for ecological education would be a great resource. Interested?

          7. **Ecological Educational Research Resource Page.** Bibliographic, descriptive, and exemplary research resource page to help faculty get educated about how understand and design educational research projects to evaluate our teaching innovations. Interested?

          8. **Outreach to Pre-College Ecological and Environmental Educators.** I don't really know what this should look like, but it seems to me that we can do a better job organizing our human and materials resources to help the thousands of teachers charged with the education of our youth. The benefits are obvious, the need is dire, and the task is monumental. Interested?

          9. **Ecological Education for Persons with Disabilities.** I would like help in developing this page. Susan Musante and I have gotten started but this job will need a volunteer. Interested?

          10. **Education symposia/talks/posters/workshops/discussions at the annual meeting.** I need someone commit to navigating the ESA main site during the early summer when the annnual meeting program goes up and creating a detailed list of all of the education related activities (with links to abstracts) organized for easy access by ESA members. Then following the meeeting, speakers need to be contacted to get e-versions of any handouts and other materials from their talks that they want posted. Interested in taking this on? 

          11. **The Annual Education Section Election.** For the last 2 years I have undertaken the task of holding an email election. Given our membership of 500 or so, we save a huge amount of Ed Section cash (>$350 ballot round trip) and we avoid the environmental costs of snail mail. However, email ballots suffer from a regrettable lack of confidentiality. The remedy is to create a CGI/PERL, JAVA, or some other web script utility that creates a web based confidential voting form (I bet other ESA Sections would be interested, too). There are lots of details to work out. Anyone interested? 

          12. **By-Laws revision.** The 1988 Education Section By-Laws written by Ken Klemow are a remarkable and farsighted work - thanks Ken! We really need to update a few things (such as the Committee structure we want, the officers we need, and their terms of office) and considering a few revisions (e.g. 2 year term for the Chair), etc. Interested in helping out? 

          13. **Education Section Archive.** Lest we doom ourselves to the struggle to re-invent what the Section has previously accomplished, we need to better document, archive, and make accessible our Section's history. In addition, tucked away here and there is a decade of ideas, projects, collaborations, and remarkable accomplishments. Interested?

          14. **Please, send me more ideas about what you would like on this page.**

If you are interested in ANY of these jobs please don't hesitate - send me an
email describing how you want to help (not just the number)! I will then put
you in touch with others who have volunteered along similar lines. Even if you
don't have a specific thing, hey I will be happy to suggest one!!! email to:
[grant@pop1.science.widener.edu](mailto:grant@pop1.science.widener.edu).

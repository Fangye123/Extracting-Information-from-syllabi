German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer once opined that "it has been granted to
the Americans less than any other nation on earth to realize the visible unity
of the church of God." What is religion's role and function for a society as
religiously pluralistic as the United States? Bonhoeffer's striking
observation reflects upon American expressions of the Christian tradition
only. Yet a countless variety of other traditions can be found throughout the
United States. Our survey of religion in America will address this question of
pluralism vs. cultural identity by reference to the historical development of
religion in the U.S. We will begin with a careful examination of the European
religious traditions transplanted into the seventeenth-century American
milieu. We will also investigate the development of traditions indigenous to
the North American continent and examine the underlying American consciousness
of "manifest destiny," "sacred space," and the pervading characterization of
Americans as a "chosen people."  
  
**_Requirements:_**

_Three Book Reviews_ (45%) Students will read all books listed below and
provide a succinct and coherent analysis of their content along with an
objective assessment of each book's significance for the study of American
religion. The length of these evaluations should not exceed five double-spaced
pages (1250 words). The Hudson-Corrigan text is required reading but is not
assigned for review. Late papers are assessed a 10% per day reduction.

  
_On-line Book Review_ (15%) Students will read Thomas Paine 's _The Age of
Reason_ at http://libertyonline.hypermall.com/Paine/Age-Of-Reason-Part-1.html
and write an objective review following the guidelines found above. Late
papers are assessed a 10% per day reduction.

  
_Comprehensive Final examination_ (30%) will be administered on April 27 at
6:00 p.m.

_Class participation_ (10%) Student attendance and participation is important
to the success of any class. The instructor may add up to 10% to the student's
final grade for solid attendance and active participation in discussions in
class _and_ on the course list service which will be linked with another
American religion class at Arizona State University. The instructor will also
subtract up to 10% of the student's grade for poor attendance and
participation. The instructor will take regular attendance, and _more than
one_ unexcused absence will affect the student's participation grade by 5% per
absence. If a student must miss class for a valid reason he or she must
contact me _before_ the missed class to receive an excused absence. Excused
absences normally involve documented medical emergencies, death in the
immediate family, unavoidable government obligation such as military service
or jury duty, and a university-sponsored activity that requires the student's
participation in an athletic event.

When grading reviews and evaluations, the instructor will pay particular
attention to the topical content of the paper along with the conventions of
grammar, spelling, punctuation, and the rhetorical devices of style and logic.
Assessment of the student's writing is based on the Chicago Manual of Style,
and grading will follow the criteria established by the University's English 1
program. Students may also wish to consult William Strunk and E.B. White, The
Elements of Style. 3rd ed. New York: Macmillan, 1979. For your convenience, an
electronic version of Elements of Style is available at

### Course Description

From the perspective of our modern world, we look upon the ownership of human
beings as an odd practice and certainly as an evil one. But the sad fact is
that the domination and control of human beings for whatever purposes the
owners might wish has been a rather widespread practice in most societies in
the world's history. In this course we shall be looking at one of the few
societies that is justifiably categorized as a 'slave society' in the sense
that its economic, social, and even political institutions were critically
shaped by the institution of slavery: the society of imperial Rome. In order
to understand the background to the development of slavery in the Roman world,
we shall first consider the development of the unusual type of slavery
(usually labelled 'chattel' slavery) that was typical of Roman society -- a
system in which the slave was treated as a commercial commodity. We shall
trace the origins of this peculiar type of slavery in the world of the Greek
city states, whose economic and political development preceded that of Rome by
a number of centuries. Consideration of the historical case of slavery in the
Greek world will provide us with a base-line against which to compare the
development of slavery in the Roman empire.

Even in a limited and well-defined social and historical context such as that
of the Roman empire, however, the institution of slavery was so complex that
we will only be able to 'scratch the surface' in our understanding of it. The
instructor will attempt to give as even a coverage as possible to the major
aspects of slavery during the time of the Roman empire. The main themes of
Roman slavery with which this course will concern itself are: the development
of the slave system, how the system was maintained, and the problems faced by
a society and a state that depended on chattel slaves for its wealth and
power. We shall also attempt to understand the ways in which the holding of
slaves affected values and attitudes in this world -- including those of
slaves who rejected their status and resisted it in many different forms,
including outright warfare. Finally, we shall try to understand how and why
the system of chattel slavery changed during the transition from the Roman
empire to the kingdoms of the early mediaeval period in western Europe.

As the instructor will repeatedly emphasize, a huge absence in the records
from Roman times is the almost complete lack of testimony from the slaves
themselves. This is a critical void in the evidence that must always be borne
in mind when we are considering any of the claims made by modern-day
historians about slavery in this period.

### Course Requirements

#### 1\. Research Paper (30%)

(a) One requirement for completion of the class (in addition to the
examinations, see below) is the submission of a written research paper. To
begin, you should choose a specific aspect of slavery on which you would wish
to pursue some independent research. Since there are aspects of slavery in the
Roman world which, though very important, are not very well documented, you
should clear your idea/choice of subject with the instructor as soon as
possible. The instructor will then assist you with some bibliography and
suggest some ways in which you might begin your research.

(b) Since slavery is a social institution that transcends the precise Roman
case that we shall be considering, one important way of pursuing an historical
analysis is to consider the main characteristics of Roman slavery when they
are compared with other slave systems known in the world's history. In order
to understand aspects of slavery that were peculiar to Roman society, perhaps
the best tactic is to use the method of comparative history. Take the
particular subject that you have selected to investigate on slavery in the
Roman world (e.g., slave rebellions and wars, slave labor, female slaves,
servile status, family life, freedmen, religion, latifundist or plantation
agriculture, philosophies or justifications of slavery,or the slave trade) and
take one good comparative case from another slave system in world history. Try
to show what the main similarities and differences are between the Roman case
and the comparative case that you have selected. Your textbook _Slavery and
Social Death_ by Orlando Patterson should be helpful here, since Patterson is
attempting to discover the basic general characteristics that were common to
many different slave systems. Finally, you should try to give some
explanations about why the two systems you are considering (the Roman one and
the case that you are using for comparison) exhibit important differences. **

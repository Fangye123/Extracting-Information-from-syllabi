(__) 1% onto your term grade for providing a photo for your 3x5 card by the
end of January.  
If you don't want to give me a photo, see me for alternatives like an office
visit.

  
**Description, policies:**

**Contact me any time and way you like**. Much of the class is one-on-one, so
I hope to speak with you personally. My home phone is 312-8885. When you email
me to ask for a meeting, be sure to tell me some times that are good for you!
The later you talk to me about a problem the less I can help, but better late
than never. Talk to me (but not to each other) during lectures, because I
value your questions and opinions.

  
**Special needs:** If you have any, contact both me and Services for Students
with Disabilities (864-2620) right away. I will work to accommodate them as
much as possible, but it is your responsibility to come to me, and to check on
it.

  
**Missed class** : Get lecture notes from a fellow student, read up in your
textbook, and see me with questions. I do not give out my notes. Absences
count as excused only for religious holidays, or with a doctor's note that you
were too sick to come (not just that you scheduled a doctor's visit during
class). If late to class you will miss quizzes, announcements, roll. See me
afterward if you missed roll.  
**Grades, penalties** : 2% penalty for no staple. Late assignments: 1/3 grade
penalty (A to A-) per class. You must put a late assignment in my hands, not
just leave it for me somewhere. Never miss a quiz/test without calling me
first!

**Grading scale:**

100-98 A+

97-93 A

92-90 A-

89-80 Bs

97-70 C

,69-60 Ds,

59-0 F.  
**Keep your papers** and exams till grades come out. Keep paper sources if
possible.  
**Academic misconduct:** For cheating, plagiarism, or inaccurate citation of
sources, expect at least a zero for that assignment and a record on your
transcript. Penalties range from there to expulsion. Consult me or the student
handbook with any question about avoiding improper behavior, especially in
writing theses.

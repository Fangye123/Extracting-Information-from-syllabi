**Description:** This course will focus on the history of Rome as it expands
from a small village in the 8th century BCE through the period of increasing
control in the Mediterranean up until the death of Julius Caesar in 44 BCE.
Although there is special focus on the evolution of Roman political dynamics,
we will also be looking at material culture, polytheism and mythology, social
mores, sub-elites and women, and the dynamics of cultural interaction in the
ancient Mediterranean. Students will concentrate throughout on the primary
evidence and the ways in which historians use literary and material
documentation to support different perspectives on the Roman past.

**[Final](finalprep.html):** Friday, December 14, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.

**Participation:** Students are required to attend class, listen thoughtfully,
and take part in classroom activities. The purchase of a pack of 3" x 5" lined
index cards is necessary to help in the documentation of participation.

**Source Analyses** focus on the ancient evidence available for specified
topics, considering such issues as agenda, rhetoric, bias and credibility of
the ancient author and how the treatment of material affects our historical
awareness. Guidelines and protocol will be circulated in advance. Due
September 28, November 5,  & December 3, by 5 p.m. in professor's mailbox,
Social Sciences 217.

**Examinations:** midterm and final will each be a combination of
identification and essay; you will choose several identification terms and one
essay topic among several presented to you. Study guides will be distributed
in advance, consisting of a number of essay topics from which those appearing
on the exam will be selected. Terms for identification will also be drawn from
these essay topics, in order to allow you to focus your preparation better. A
successful essay must present a thesis and well-organized supporting
arguments, making use of primary sources as documentary evidence; a successful
identification must give the meaning of the term, place it in the appropriate
chronological, geographical, and historical context and explain the
significance of the item for the history of the Roman Republic. Final
examination will NOT be cumulative.

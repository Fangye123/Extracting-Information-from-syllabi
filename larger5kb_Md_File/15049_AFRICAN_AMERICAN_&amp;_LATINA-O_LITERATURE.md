##  An Example of a Conjure Story collected by Zora Neale Hurston in "Hoodoo

         But Aunt Judy was not unsung. The people had not forgotten how 
    
    she fixed Horace Carter.
    
         Horace was a husband eternally searching for love outside his home. He 
    
    spent every cent he could rake and scrape on his clothes, on hair pomades and 
    
    walking sticks, and the like.
    
         When he brutally impressed his wife with the fact that there was 
    
    nothing, absolutely nothing she could do about it, she said to him one Sunday 
    
    morning in desperaration: 'Horace, if you don't mind your ways I'm going to 
    
    take your case to Aunt Judy.'"
    
         He laughed. "Tell her, sell her; turn her up and smell her." He went on 
    
    about his business.
    
         She did tell Aunt Judy and it is said she laid a hearing on Mr Horace. 
    
    He had a new suit in the post office. (It is customary to order clothes C.O.D. 
    
    from mail-order houses, and they remain in the post office until paid out.) He 
    
    was bragging about how swell he would look in it. An out-of-town girl was 
    
    coming over the first Sunday after he got his new suit out to help him switch 
    
    it around. That was the next Sunday after he had laughed at his wife and Aunt 
    
    Judy.
    
         So he got his suit out. He had a hat, shoes and everything to match.
    
         He put the suit on and strolled over to the depot to meet the train, 
    
    but before it came, he took sick. He seemed to be vomiting so violently that it 
    
    was running out of his nose as well as his mouth. His clothes were ruined and a 
    
    great swarm of flies followed him. Before he could reach home, it was 
    
    discovered that he was defecating through his mouth and nose. This kept up, 
    
    off and on, for six months. He couldn't tell when it would start, nor stop. So 
    
    he kept himself hidden most of the time. 
    
         Aunt Judy said,"The dirty puppy! I'll show him how to talk under my 
    
    clothes! Turn me up and smell me, hunh? I'll turn him up, and they'll sho smell 
    
    him."
    
         They say he paid her to take it off him after a while.

##  O Black and Unknown Bards James Weldon Johnson 1908

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    O black and unknown bards of long ago,
    
    How came your lips to touch the sacred fire?
    
    How, in your darkness did you come to know
    
    The power and the beauty of the mistrel's lyre?
    
    Who first from the midst his bonds lifted his eyes?
    
    Who first from out the still watch, lone and long,
    
    Feeling the ancient faith of prophets rise
    
    Within his dark-kept soul, burst into song?
    
    
    
    Hearth of what slave poured out such melody
    
    As "Steal Away to Jesus"? On its strains
    
    His spirit must have nightly floated free,
    
    Though still about his hands he felt his chains.
    
    Who heard the great "Jordan roll"? Whose starward eye
    
    Saw chariot "swing low"? And who was he
    
    That breathed that comforting, melodic sigh,
    
    "Nobody Knows de Trouble I See"?
    
    
    
    What merely living clod, what captive thing,
    
    Could up toward God through all its darkness grope,
    
    And finfd within its deadened heart to sing
    
    These songs of sorrow, love, and faith, and hope?
    
    How did it catch that subtle undertone,
    
    That note in music heard not with the ear?
    
    How sound the elusive reed so seldom blown,
    
    Which stirs the soul or melts the heart to tears.
    
    
    
    Not that great German master in his dream
    
    Of harmonies that thundered amongst the stars
    
    At the creation, ever heard a theme
    
    Nobler than "Go down, Moses." Mark its bars,
    
    How like the mightly trumpet-call they stir
    
    The blood. Such are the notes that men have sung
    
    Going to valorous deeds; such tones there were
    
    That helped make history when Time was young.
    
    
    
    There is a wide, wide wonder in it all,
    
    That from degraded rest servile toil
    
    The fiery spirit of the seer should call
    
    These simple childer of the sun and soil.
    
    O black slave singers, gone, forgot, unfamed,
    
    You--you alone, of all the long, long line
    
    Of those who've sung untaught, unknown, unnamed,
    
    Have stretched out upward, seeking the divine.
    
    
    
    You sang not deeds of heroes or of kings;
    
    No chant of bloody war, no exulting paean
    
    Of arms-won triumphs; but your humble strings
    
    You touched in the chord with music empyrean.
    
    You sang far better than you knew; the songs
    
    That for your listeners' hungry hearts sufficed
    
    Still live--but more than this to you belongs;
    
    You sang a race from wood to stone to Christ.

    Lift every voice and sing

    Let our rejoicing rise
    
    High as the listening skies,
    
    Let it resound loud as the rolling sea.
    
    Sing a song full of the faith that the dark past has taught us,
    
    Sing a song full of hope that the present has brought us.
    
    Facing the rising sun of our new day begun,
    
    Let us march on till victory is won.
    
    
    
    Stony the road we trod,
    
    Bitter the chastening rod,
    
    Felt in the days when hope unborn had died;
    
    Yet with a steady beat
    
    Have not our weary feet
    
    Come to the place for which our fathers sighed?
    
    We have come overa way that with tears has been watered,
    
    We have come, treading our path through the blood of the slaughtered,
    
    Out from the gloomy past,
    
    Till now we stand at last
    
    Where the white gleam of our bright star is cast.
    
    
    
    God of our weary years,
    
    Good of our silient years,
    
    Though who has brought us thus far on the way;
    
    Thou who hast by Thy might
    
    Led us into the light,
    
    Led us into the light,
    
    Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
    
    Keep us forever in the path, we pray.
    
    Lest our feet stray from the places, our God, where we met Thee,
    
    Lest, our hearths drunk with the wine of the world, we forget Thee
    
    Shadow beneath Thy hand,
    
    May we forever stand.
    
    True to our God,
    
    True to our native land.

    Naked woman, black women
    
    Cloth with your colour which is life, with your form which is beauty!
    
    In your shadow I have grown up; the gentleness of your hands was laid over my
    
       eyes.
    
    And Now, high up on the sun-backed pass, at the heart of summer, at the 
    
         heart of noon, I come upon you, my Promised Land,
    
    And your beauty strikes me to the heart like the flash of an eagle.

         Wind's eager caresses
    
    Carved tom-tom, taut tom-tom, muttering under the Conqueror's fingers
    
    Your solemn contalto voice is the spiritual song of the Beloved.
    
    
    
    Naked woman, dark woman
    
    Oil that no breath ruffles, calm oil on the athlete's flanks, on the flanks of
    
          the Prices of Mali
    
    Gazelle limbed in Paradise, petals are stars on the night of your skin
    
    Delights of the mind, the glinting of red gold against your water skin
    
    Under the shadow of your hair, my care is lightened by neighbouring suns
    
    of your eyes.
    
    
    
    Naked woman, black women,
    
    I sing your beauty that passes, the form that I fix in the Eternal,
    
    Before jealous Fate turn you to ashes to feed the roots of life.

##  To the Young, White Man Who Asked Me How I, An Intelligent, Well-Read
Person Could Believe in the War Between Races Lorca Dee Cervantes(b. 1954)
1981

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
         
    
    In my land there are no distictions.
    
    The barbed wire politics of oppression
    
    have been torn down long ago. The only reminder
    
    of past battles, lost or won, is a slight
    
    rutting in the fertile fields.
    
    
    
    In my land
    
    people write poems about love,
    
    full of nothing but contented childlike syllables.
    
    Everyone reads Russian short shories and weeps.
    
    There are no boundries.
    
    There is no hunger, no
    
    complicated famine or greed.
    
    
    
    I am not a revolutionary.
    
    I don't even like political poems.
    
    Do you think I can believe in a war between the races?
    
    
    
    I can deny it. I can forget about it
    
    when I'm safe
    
    living on my own continent of harmony
    
    and home, but I am not
    
    there
    
    
    
    I believe in relolution
    
    because everywhere the crosses are burning
    
    sharp-shooting goose-steppers round every corner,
    
    there are snippers in the schools...
    
    (I know you don't believe this.
    
    You think this is nothing
    
    but a faddish exaggeration. But they
    
    are not shooting at you.)
    
    
    
    I'm marked by the color of my skin.
    
    The bullets are discrete and designed
    
    to kill slowly.
    
    They are aimeing at my children.
    
    These are the facts.
    
    Let me show you my wounds: my stumbling mind, my
    
    "excuse me" tongue, and this
    
    nagging preoccupation 
    
    with the feeling of not being good enough.
    
    
    
    These bullets bury deeper than logic.
    
    Racism is not intellectual
    
    I can not reason these scars away.
    
    
    
    Outside my door
    
    there is a real enemy
    
    who hates me.
    
    who yearns to dance on rooftops
    
    to wisper delicate lines about joy
    
    and the blessing of human understanding.
    
    I try. I go to my land, mt tower of words and
    
    bolt the door, but the typewriter doesn't fade out
    
    the sounds of blasting and muffled outrage.
    
    Every day I am deluged with reminders
    
    that this is not 
    
    my land
    
    
    
    and this is my land
    
    
    
    I do not believe in the war between the races
    
    
    
    but in this country
    
    there is war.

##  Kansas I (collected in Heath Anthology of American Lit, Vol II) 1860's An
example of a Corridas -Sp. Am. narrative ballad rooted in medieval Spain

    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    When we left for Kansas with a great herd of cattle,
    
    ah, what a long trail it was! I was not sure I would survive.
    
    
    
    The caporal would tell us, as if he was going to cry,
    
    "Watch out for that bunch of steers; don't let them get past you.
    
    
    
    Ah, what a good horse I had! He did nothing but gallop
    
    And, ah, what a violent cloudburst! I was not sure I would come back.
    
    
    
    Some of us asked for cigarettes, others wanted something to eat
    
    and the caporal would tell us, "so be it, it can't be helped."
    
    
    
    By the pond at Palomas a vicious steer left the herd.
    
    and the caporal lassoed it on his honey-colored horse.
    
    
    
    Go tell the caporal that a vaquero has been killed;
    
    all he left was his leather jacket hanging on the rails of the corral
    
    
    
    We got to the Salado River, and we swam our horses across;
    
    an American was saying, "Those men are as good as drowned."
    
    
    
    I wonder what the man thought, that we came to learn, perhaps
    
    why, we're from the Rio Grande, where the good swimmers are from.
    
    
    
    And then Kansas came in sight, and the caporal tells us,
    
    "We have finally made it, we'll soon have them in the corral."
    
    
    
    Back again in San Anonio, we all brought ourselves good hats,
    
    and this is the end of the singing of the stanzas about the trail drivers.

    curious, to meet the humming moons we rode
    
    in this gully, without grass or stars. Our footprinrs
    
    were foreign to him. He understood the light
    
    and paused before the right front wheel, a shadow               _SOE_
    
    of the mineral earth, pine tar in his fur.
    
    Such dogs avoid our eyes, yet he recognized and held
    
    my gaze. A being both so terrible and shy
    
    it made my blood desperate
    
    for the space he lived in:
    
    broad water cutting terraced canyons,
    
    and ice gleaming under hawthorne like a floor of scales.
    
    Thick river, remember we were light thanking light,
    
    slow music rising. Trees perhaps, or my own voice
    
    out of tune. I danced a human claim for him
    
    in this gully. No stars. He slipped
    
    by us, old as breath, moving in the rushing dark
    
    like moonlight through tamarack,
    
    wave on wave of unknown country.
    
    Crazed, I can't get close enough
    
    to this tumble wild and tangled miricle.
    
    Night is the first skin around me.

    Because we live in the browning season
    
    the heavy air blocking our breath,                     _SOE_
    
    and in this time when living
    
    is only survival, we doubt the voices
    
    that come shadowed on the air,
    
    that weave within our brains
    
    certain thoughts, a motion that is soft,
    
    imperceptible, a twilight rain,
    
    soft feather's fall, a small body
    
    dropping into its nest, rustling, murmuring,
    
    settling in for the night.
    
    
    
    
    
    Because we live in the hardedged season,
    
    where the plastic brittle and gleaming shines
    
    and in this space that is cornered and angled,
    
    we do not notice wet, moist, the significant
    
    drops falling in perfect sheres
    
    that are certain measures of our monds;
    
    almost invisible, those tears,
    
    soft as dew, fragile, that cling to leaves,
    
    petals, roots, gentle and sure,
    
    every morning.
    
    
    
    
    
    We are the women of the daylight; of clocks and steel
    
    foundries, of drugstores and streetlights,
    
    of superhighways that slice our days in two
    
    Wrapped around in glass and steel we ride
    
    our lives; behind dark glasses we hide our eyes,
    
    our thoughts, shaded, seem obscure, smoke
    
    fills our minds, wisky husks our songs,
    
    polyester cuts our bodies from our breath,
    
    our feet from welcoming stones of earth.
    
    Our dreams are pale memories of themselves,
    
    and nagging doubt is the false measure of our days.
    
    
    
    Even so, the spirit voices are singing,
    
    their thoughts are dancing in the dirty air.
    
    Their feet though the cement, the asphalt
    
    delighting, still they weave dreams upon our
    
    shadowed skulls, if we could listen.
    
    If we could hear.
    
    Let's go then. Let's find them. Let's 
    
    ride the midnight, the early dawn. Feel the wind
    
    striding through our hair. Let's dance
    
    the dance of feathers, the dance of birds.

    Perfection   Kahil Gibran (Lebenon) 1951        _The Treasured Writings
    
                                                        of Kahil Gibran_ 
    
     
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    
    You ask me, my brother, when will man reach
    
    perfection. Hear my answer:
    
    Man approaches perfection when he 
    
    feels that he is in an infinite space and a sea
    
    without shore.
    
    An everlasting fire, an unquenchable
    
    light.
    
    A calm wind or a raging tempest, a thundering sky
    
    or a rainy heaven,
    
    A singing brook or a wailing rivulet, a tree abloom
    
    in Spring, or a naked sammpling
    
    in Autumn,
    
    A rising mountain or a secending valley,
    
    a fertile plain or a desert.
    
    
    
    When man feels all these, he has already
    
    reached halfway to perfection. To attain his goal
    
    he must then perceive
    
    that he is child dependent upon his mother,
    
    a father responsible for his family,
    
    A youth lost in love,
    
    An ancient wrestling against his past,
    
    A worshipper in his temple, a criminal in
    
    prison
    
    A scholar amidst his parchements.
    
    An ignorant soul stumbling between the darkness of his
    
    night and the obscurity of his day,
    
    A nus suffering bewteen the flowers of her faith and
    
    the thisles of her loneiness,
    
    A prostitute caught between the fangs of her
    
    eweakness and the claws of her needs,
    
    A poor man trapped between his bitterness and 
    
    his submission,
    
    A rich man between his greed and his conscience,
    
    A poet between the mist of his twilight and the rays of his dawn.
    
    
    
    can experience, see, and understand
    
    things can reach perfection and 
    
    be a shadow of God's Shadow.

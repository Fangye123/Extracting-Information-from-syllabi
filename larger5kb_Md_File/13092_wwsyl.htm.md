**HISTORY 2341**  
  **(World War II)**

**Dr. Allan Purcell**

![](rada.gif)

**COURSE OBJECTIVE:** This course will acquaint the student with the basic
facts of United States participation in World War II using a textbook,
classroom exposition, outside readings, computer-assisted instruction, and
audio-visual techniques. Although the coverage of the material is
comprehensive, there will be an emphasis on political, constitutional,
military, and economic history.

**TEXTBOOK: ** Robert Leckie. _Delivered From Evil_.

![](Sargent.gif)

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

**1\. The material in _Delivered From Evil_ is to be read and studied**
according to the attached schedule.

**2\. Punctual and regular attendance is required**.   Any student
accumulating three (3) or more UNEXCUSED absences MAY be dropped from this
course.  This is at the discretion of the instructor.

**3\. The quality and quantity of the work done by the student determines
his/her final grade:**

  **For the grade of "A"** , the student must complete all four unit exams
with an overall average of 90 or above AND write two analytical book reviews
(at least one of which must be graded **"EXCELLENT"** and the other
**"ACCEPTABLE"** ) AND pass the course map test.

  **For the grade of "B"** , the student must complete all four unit exams
with an overall average of 80 or above AND write one analytical book review
(which must be graded at least **"ACCEPTABLE"** ) AND pass the course map
test.

  **For the grade of "C"** , the student must complete all four unit exams
with an overall average of 70 or above AND pass the course map test.

  **For the grade of "F"** , the student who fails to take all four unit exams
or who fails to maintain an overall average of 70 on these four unit exams or
who fails the course map test or who commits any act of scholastic dishonesty
will earn the grade of "F".

**  For the grade of "I"**, the student must have a medical excuse certified
by a physician. Otherwise there will be NO Incompletes.

**UNIT EXAMS:** Each of the four unit exams may be taken twice.  The first
time will be in class on the day mentioned in the attached semester schedule.
If the student wishes to retest, they may take the exam one more time in the
Testing Center.  However, there are two restrictions on the retest: first,
**the HIGHEST GRADE POSSIBLE ON THE RETEST IS 70** and second,  **THIS RETEST
MUST BE TAKEN WITHIN ONE WEEK OF THE TIME THE UNIT EXAM IS GIVEN IN CLASS.**
The higher of the two grades will be the one recorded for the student for that
unit exam.   (If a student misses the unit exam in class for good cause- as
determined by the instructor- they may then take the unit exam in the Testing
Center for the first time with no restrictions on the grade.) **CAUTION:
STUDENTS TAKING OR RETAKING UNIT EXAMS IN THE TESTING CENTER SHOULD RETAIN THE
TESTING CENTER "FEEDBACK" SHEET AND PRESENT IT TO THE INSTRUCTOR AT THE NEXT
CLASS MEETING.**  
   The unit exams consist of multiple-choice questions covering the textbook
material and classroom exposition as highlighted by the learning objectives
issued for each chapter.

  **AL'S SPECIAL DISPENSATION:** If I have scheduled my unit exam on the same
day on which you are already taking one or more exams, you may take my exam a
day or two earlier or later (in the Testing Center), PROVIDED THAT YOU TELL ME
BEFORE THE EXAM DAY.

**MAP TEST:** Because World War II history is shaped and influenced by the
geography of the conflict, it is imperative that the student knows the basic
facts of World War II geography.  Therefore the student will be required to
pass a geography map test.  This test will require the student to locate on an
outline map of the world twenty of the features named on the attached list.  A
passing score is 80. The test will be taken in the classroom on an outline map
provided with Unit Exam #1.  This map test must be passed by the mid-semester
point.

**COMPUTER-ASSISTED INSTRUCTION:** This is entirely voluntary.  All of the
learning objectives for this course have been programmed on selected computers
in the CBI Lab, as well as in the accompanying internet computer tutorial.
Further instructions on the use of this material as one means of learning
course material will be provided during an in-class demonstration period at
the beginning of each semester.  I wish to make two important points
concerning computer-assisted instruction: first, this is completely voluntary-
the student is **NOT** required to use computer-assisted instruction, however
experience has shown those students who do use it tend to score higher on the
unit exams and second, computer-assisted instruction supplements but **DOES
NOT REPLACE   CLASSROOM INSTRUCTION**.  Even if students use computer-assisted
instruction, they must still attend class.

**ANALYTICAL BOOK REVIEWS:**  
**Rationale:** This analytical book review will critically examine an
important scholarly book covering some aspect of United States participation
in World War II.

The purpose of this review is twofold: first, to acquaint the student with a
classic volume of historical scholarship and second, to allow the student to
think critically about an important facet of American history and then to
organize your thoughts in clear, cogent prose.  You should not view this
simply as a hurdle which you must overcome in order to earn a grade of "A" or
"B" in this course, but rather approach it as an opportunity to expand your
creativity in thinking and writing, two very important aspects of any
individual's necessary life skills.  Therefore, be advised that I consider
this a VERY important aspect of this course and your reviews will be read and
graded VERY carefully.

**Form:** Each book review will be approximately 1500 words long, although
this is a general guideline and not an absolute requirement.  The main
objective of this analytical book review should be to comprehensively cover
the three sections of the following book review outline:  
  **Part I:** This is a brief outline of the contents of the book.   In the
space of one or two paragraphs you should be able to convey the parameters of
the book's contents.  DO NOT simply reproduce the book's table of contents.  
  **Part II: ** Here is the place for a careful summary of the author's
thesis.   The thesis is the primary idea the author is trying to prove and
convince the reader to accept.  You must first identify the thesis and then
show how the author either substantiates or fails to substantiate this thesis.
This will undoubtedly take you a page or two to do a good job.  
  **Part III:** This is the most important part of your book review.   Here is
where you describe your reaction to the book.  Some of the questions you must
answer include: Do you agree or disagree with the book's conclusions?  Why?
Did the book support or contradict what you read in your textbook on the same
subject? (You **MUST** quote some of the relevant passages from both books.)
Did you detect any biases on the part of the author?  What was the author's
background and why did he or she write the book?  How in your opinion could
the book have been improved?  You must be specific and keep in mind there are
NO perfect books.  Did you enjoy reading the book? Why or why not?  Would you
recommend it to others?

**Grading:** The book reviews will be graded **"EXCELLENT"** , **"ACCEPTED"**
, or **"NOT ACCEPTED"**. The second book review, required only of those
seeking the grade of "A", must be graded **"EXCELLENT"**.    The first book
review, required of those seeking the grades of "A" and "B", must be at least
**"ACCEPTED"**.   Any **"NOT ACCEPTED"** books will be returned to the student
to be rewritten.  


**Due Dates:** The first analytical book review is due at mid-semester. This
is required for those seeking a "B" or "A" in the course.  
The second analytical book review is due one week before the end of the
semester. This is required only of those seeking the grade of "A" in the
course.

**Books:** The following books may be read for the analytical book review.  If
you wish to substitute another book for one of these, **YOU MUST RECEIVE THE
INSTRUCTOR'S PRIOR APPROVAL**.   All of the following books are found on the
shelves of the RGC Library.

**ADDITIONAL BOOKS FOR BOOK REVIEW:** There are many other excellent books
written on subjects concerning World War II that are not in the ACC LRC at
RGC.   You may find them at the Austin Public Library or at one of the UT
Libraries.  If a particular subject or topic mentioned in the textbook appeals
to you, check the textbook bibliography and then see if the book is in one of
these libraries.  If you select a book not on the list on page 4 of this
syllabus, please show me the book BEFORE you begin to read it.

### Broad-Focus Sites

These are sites which provide access to a wide variety of general resources in
literature and the humanities.  

#### Specialized sites

  * [The Labyrinth](http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/labyrinth-home.html): An indispensable source for medieval studies on the web. Certainly the most extensive collection of resources currently available. (Georgetown U.) 
  * [ORB: Online Reference Book for Medieval Studies](http://orb.rhodes.edu/): A valuable and well-organized reference site, with a growing array of resources. 
  * [Internet Medieval Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/sbook.html): A useful and wide-ranging collection of resources, although not especially strong on Middle English.. 
  * [Netserf](http://netserf.cua.edu/): Very useful and extensive collection of links to resources for medieval studies.
  * [Argos](http://argos.evansville.edu/): A limited-area search engine for the study of the ancient and medieval worlds. Selective (sites are peer-reviewed) and very useful.  (Evansville U.)
  * [History of the English Language Website](http://ebbs.english.vt.edu/hel/hel.html):  A useful collection of links for the development of the language, from Old English to modern English.  (Virginia Tech)

#### General Sites

  * [Voice of the Shuttle](http://vos.ucsb.edu/index.html): A general humanities site rather than one which is primarily literary in its focus. Perhaps the most valuable site on the web for locating texts and other resources in the humanities.  A clearinghouse rather than a separate collection; includes material drawn from a wide variety of other online collections. See especially its [English Literature Page](http://vos.ucsb.edu/shuttle/english.html). (U.C./Santa Barbara) 
  * [The English Server at Carnegie Mellon U.](http://english-server.hss.cmu.edu/):  A collection of links to sites for literary, rhetorical and cultural studies.  Probably the web's best clearinghouse for matters related to English studies.  
  * [The Human-Languages Page](http://www.june29.com/HLP/):  A clearinghouse for sites concerned with  linguistic and literary matters in a wide variety of languages.

### On-line Books

This is a small and fairly selective sampling of the sites which provide texts
free for download.  

####     Specialized Collections

  *  [Luminarium](http://www.luminarium.org/lumina.htm):  Valuable and elegantly designed site. Excellent collection of links to major early English texts, as well as to online articles, graphics, audio clips, etc. Covers Middle English through seventeenth century works.
  * [Online Medieval and Classical Library](http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/OMACL/): Useful online collection of ancient and medieval texts. Covers a variety of European literatures.  (UC/Berkeley)
  * [Internet Classics Archive](http://classics.mit.edu/index.html):  The best online collection of classical Greek and Latin texts.  Useful for exploring the rich classical background of medieval and early modern literature.  (M.I.T.)
  * [Christian Classics Ethereal Library](http://ccel.wheaton.edu/):  A very impressive collection of Christian theological and devotional texts.  Includes complete sets of the Church Fathers, etc.  Useful for exploring the religious background and references of early modern literature.  (Wheaton)

####     General Collections

  * [Literary Resources on the Net](http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Lit/): Not a books page, but a selective (and very good) guide to other books pages on the Internet. (Jack Lynch) 
  * [The Online Books Page](http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/): The best single source for free online books of all kinds. A clearinghouse rather than a separate collection; includes books drawn from a wide variety of other online collections. (U. of Penn.) 
  * [The ERIS Project](http://www.vt.edu/vt98/academics/books/AABookIndex.html): A fairly sizeable collection of "classic" texts, primarily from literature and philosophy. (Virginia Tech) 
  * [University of Toronto English Library](http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/index.html):  A valuable collection of "selections" from a wide variety of authors.  Especially strong on poetry.

  * [Project Bartleby](http://www.bartleby.com/): A good but limited collection of "classic" books (named after Herman Melville's "Bartleby the Scrivener"); "classic" is stretched a bit to include writers like Agatha Christie. (Columbia Univ.) 
  * [Electronic Text Center](http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/): A good collection of literary texts. Includes texts in English and at least a dozen other languages. Not all texts are accessible to the general public, but it is still a very worthwhile resource. (Univ. of Virginia) 
  * [Project Gutenberg](http://promo.net/pg/): One of the original online books projects. Includes "classics" (like Homer and Shakespeare), as well as more popular texts (like Jules Verne and Edgar Rice Burroughs) and a miscellany of other texts (on sometimes rather odd subjects). 
  * [SparkNotes](http://www.sparknotes.com/):  For those who want a little help with reading a difficult or unfamiliar work.  Includes background, character sketches, plot summaries, etc. on a variety of works.

### On-line Journals

There is a growing number of scholarly journals which are fully online or have
significant online components.  The following list includes only those which
provide free public access to full-text articles or abstracts, and which are
concerned at least in part with medieval or early modern literary studies.

### Bibliographies

These are bibliographies which cover more general subject areas.  More
specialized bibliographies, such as those on Chaucer or _Beowulf_ or on Anglo-
Saxon studies, are listed in the appropriate sections of this website (see the
navigation frame at left).

  * [University of Kansas Index of Medieval Studies Bibliographies](http://kuhttp.cc.ukans.edu/ftp/pub/history/Europe/Medieval/bibliographies/):  Includes dozens of specialized bibliographies.  A gopher index (with filenames but no descriptive titles), and so a bit cumbersome to use.  Worth exploring for the useful material it contains.
  * [Women Writers of the Middle Ages](http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/womenbib.htm):  Extensive bibliography from the Robbins Library at the University of Rochester.  Includes well-known writers like St. Catherine of Siena, Christine de Pisan and Hildegard of Bingen, as well as a host of less well-known figures.  (U. of Rochester)
  * [Medieval English Drama](http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/playbib.htm):  A somewhat less extensive bibliography from the Robbins Library; still very useful.  (U. of Rochester)
  * [ORB Bibliographies:  Later Medieval England](http://orb.rhodes.edu/bibliographies/late-eng.html):  A "suggested reading list" for medieval historical studies.  Not literary in its focus, but useful for background.

all, they provide useful background and reference material for understanding
medieval and early modern texts.

  * [The Perseus Project](http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/):  An impressively rich resource for the study of Greek and Roman literature, history, arts and culture.

Useful for exploring the rich classical background of medieval and early modern literature.  (Tufts U.)

_20TH CENTURY GERMANY_ (Syllabus)

This lecture course will present and analyze central aspects of the German
history from 1900 to 1989, including: *World War I and the 1918 Revolution in
Germany; *the attempt to establish a democratic state, 1919-32; *the Third
Reich and the Holocaust, 1933-1945; *the diverging paths of East and West
Germany from division to unification, 1945-1989.  
  
The main purposes of this course are: 1) to familiarize you with the main
contours of the history of one of the most dynamic nation-states in the 20th
century; 2) to examine the creation, resilience, breakdown, and recreation of
political culture and social structures; 3) to demonstrate how evidence can be
used to explain complex historical developments in different ways.

**Qualitative Research Methods**  


_Course Goals_  


The central goal of the seminar is to enable students to create and critique
methodologically sophisticated case study research designs in the social
sciences. To do so, the seminar will explore the techniques, uses, strengths,
and limitations of case study methods, while emphasizing the relationships
among these methods, alternative methods, and contemporary debates in the
philosophy of science. The research examples used to illustrate methodological
issues will be drawn from international relations, comparative politics, and
American politics. However, the methodological content of the course is also
applicable to the study of history, sociology, and economics.  


The seminar will begin with a focus on the philosophy of science, theory
construction, theory testing, causality, and causal inference. With this
epistemological grounding, the seminar will then explore the core issues in
case study research design, including methods of structured and focused
comparisons of cases, typological theory, case selection, process tracing,
congruence testing, and the use of counterfactual analysis. Next, the seminar
will look at the epistemological assumptions, comparative strengths and
weaknesses, and proper domain of case study methods and alternative
approaches, particularly statistical methods and formal modeling. The fourth
section of the course will methodologically critique examples of case study
research within defined research programs. These examples will be selected in
part based on the interests and input of seminar participants. The final three
weeks of the seminar will be devoted to student presentations of case study
research designs and constructive critiques of these designs by seminar
participants. Presumably, many students will choose to present the research
design for their thesis, though students could also present a research design
for a separate project or edited volume.  


_Requirements_  


**Mastery of assigned readings and active participation in seminar
discussions.**  


**One short essay critiquing the assigned readings for one week.** Each
student will be required to write one 1500-1800 word critique of the assigned
readings for a given week. This critique can focus on one or several of the
readings for the week, or on one or a few cross-cutting themes. It need not
address all of the readings or discussion questions for a week.  


**Research Design Paper and Presentation.** Students will be required to
submit copies of a research design paper to all seminar participants one week
in advance of presenting this design in the seminar. Each student will present
their design in the seminar for a constructive critique of a half-hour or so,
with a short introduction from the student and/or advance reading questions
suggesting issues or methodological dilemmas upon which participants should
focus.  


Research designs should address all of the following tasks (elaborated upon in
the Bennett-George paper, "Research Design Tasks," in the assigned readings
below): 1) specification of the research problem and research objectives, in
relation to the current stage of development and research needs of the
relevant research program, related literatures, and alternative explanations;
2) specification of the independent and dependent variables; 3) selection of a
historical case or cases that are appropriate in light of the first two tasks,
and justification of why these cases were selected and others were not; 4)
consideration of how variance in the variables can best be described for
testing and/or refining existing theories; 5) specification of the data
requirements, including both process tracing data and measurements of the
independent and dependent variables for the main hypotheses of interest,
including alternative explanations.  


There is no minimum length limit, though most designs will probably be around
7,000-9,000 words and should be shorter than 11,000 words.

**Follow-up memo on refinement of the research design.** While students are
not expected to revise fully and resubmit their research designs by the end of
the course, they will be required to submit a memo of about 1500 words on the
modifications they think are necessary, and the dilemmas that are still
unresolved, in light of the critique they received in the seminar.  


_Grading_

30% mastery of the readings as evident through participation in class
discussions

20% short essay

50% written research design, presentation of research design, and follow-up
memo

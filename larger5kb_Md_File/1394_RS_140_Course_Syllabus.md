### COURSE DESCRIPTION:

This course explores the context, teaching, and influence of two great
traditions: Judaism and Islam. My goals are:

First, an introduction to each tradition on its own terms. These traditions
have logics and beauty all their own, which must be appreciated in order to be
understood. This course is an opportunity to think theologically and
philosophically, systematically and occasionally, long and hard, at two
traditions that have been immensely influential and durable. Both seek to
glorify the God of Abraham and Jesus. Both have taught us at many points how
to be better Christians. Both have also suffered at Christian hands, and
sometimes Christians have suffered at theirs.

Second, the experience of studying two traditions according to the methods of
rival traditions relatively foreign to both: Enlightenment historiography, and
Christian faith.

Third, improved facility in reading, thinking, writing, and speaking
(preferably in that order), particularly regarding the traditions' holy texts.

This is not a "king of the mountain" apologetics course that knocks down all
rivals to the intellectually superior Christian faith. Christians may indeed
judge all things according to the Gospel. But when we do it too soon, we often
find ourselves criticizing a straw man and embarrassing the Lord we intended
to serve.

### COURSE FORMAT:

Sleepy students, beware: This is a seminar, not a lecture course. Doing the
reading is crucial (and there is a lot of it). I will introduce each faith,
but class time will concentrate on student presentations and discussions. Like
you, I will interrupt, ask questions, mount my soapbox, and go off on what
look like (and sometimes actually are) tangents. You will be responsible not
only for the content of your own presentations, but also for your colleagues'.

Having trouble understanding the reading? I will be posting [introductions to
readings](readingnotes.html) in advance. If even these do not help, then I
leave you with the Talmud:

> If someone tells you, "I have labored but not found," do not believe him. If
he says, "I have not labored, but I have found," do not believe him. But, if
he says, "I have labored and have found," then believe him ( _Megillah_ 6b,
quoted in Elliot N. Dorff and Louis E. Newman, eds., _Contemporary Jewish
Theology: A Reader_ [New York: Oxford, 1999], 17).

In other words, giving up on difficult material is not an option.

powerful, just as your writing will need to be. If you cannot identify (for

appositive on sight, or confuse "its" with "it's," then consider this book
required._ **

### ASSIGNMENTS AND OPPORTUNITIES:

1\. **Attendance** at class sessions and participation in discussions is
required. If this is true of lecture courses, it is even more so in seminars.

2\. Each of you will give one in-class **presentation** on that day's
readings. Here you will provide helpful context for other students, make
observations, and raise questions for us to discuss. These may take several
forms: Recitation of a text for discussion, lecture, or some other format (the
choice is up to you, in consultation with me). A typical discussion text
amounts to 2-3 _tightly written_ , single-spaced pages. Please distribute
copies to your classmates on the day of your presentation. Your presentation
will count as 25% of your final grade. As you write, please
[refer](../../../material/writing.html) to my suggestions for writing papers
for helpful suggestions, cautions about Internet "research", ultimata
regarding late papers and plagiarism, and so on.

3\. Everyone who is not presenting that day will bring a 1-2 page typewritten
**brief** that (1) summarizes the reading, and (2) asks at least one
thoughtful question for discussion. These should be in prose-outline form
([see](../../../material/readingnotes.pdf) my rationale and example), well
written. _If your briefs do not conform to the requirements, I will hand them
back and you will need to resubmit them._ I do not normally accept late
briefs, though I do accept briefs _ahead of time_ for absences. I will collect
these after class, and grade them as follows:  "+", "-", "U" (unacceptable),
or "0" (absent). They will comprise 35% of your final grade.

4\. You will write four reports: (1) A report of either a visit to a
[synagogue](http://uahc.org/ca/cbb/jewish_sb.html) service or a substantive
personal interaction with a group of Jews. (2) A report of either a visit to a
[mosque](http://www.geocities.com/worshipallah/) or a substantive personal
interaction with a group of Muslims. (3) An analysis of a holy text (Tanakh or
Quran) as interpreted within its tradition. (4) A reflection on the Jewish or
Muslim tradition (or both) from your own perspective (which may be one of
Christian faith). Each report should be 3-4 double-spaced pages. It will need
to draw explicitly on the course materials. _Reports will be circulated to the
class._ Each report will count as 10% of your final grade. Reports are due
April 22 (Monday of the last week of class), but I encourage you to submit
them throughout the semester.

5\. Outside of class, we will occasionally screen films that bear upon the
Jewish or Muslim faith. These are _entirely extracurricular_ and involve no
written assignments.

6\. To stimulate discussion, this class will have its own **e-mail**
discussion group you will use to take class discussions into and out of class
sessions. This is a place for you to post questions and thoughtful answers to
the questions of others. I will lurk, responding and posing questions only
when I consider it necessary. Send e-mail to
[rs140@westmont.edu](mailto:rs140@westmont.edu).

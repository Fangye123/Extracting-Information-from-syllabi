107\. After Evil: The Political Morality of Survivorship and Recovery

Instructor: R. Meister  
Office: Kresge 228, Phone 459-4563  
Office hours: Th 1:15 - 2:15

What does it mean to live in the aftermath of a morally unacceptable past? Is
peace among the survivors of evil inevitably (and merely) a compromise between
the grievances of former victims and the fear on the part former perpetrators
and their beneficiaries that reprisals will occur? Would a just peace require
the continuation of a morally legitimate struggle by other, less violent,
means until the ongoing effects of evil have been eradicated? Or is
reconciliation itself the morally appropriate response to an evil that has
been defeated?

The course will draw on a variety of sources to understand better the
metaphors of both war and peace as potentially appropriate attitudes toward
evils past and present. Building on this foundation, we will explore the moral
logic of the "human rights culture" that is the stated goal of liberal
transitions in post-traumatic regimes. Our focus will be on relations between
the continuing beneficiaries of past evil in such societies and those who
claim to speak for the victims. Does the achievement of consensus that past
was evil require an implicit agreement that evil is now past, and hence that
its beneficiaries may be allowed to keep their gains? What are the moral and
constitutional constraints placed on "nations in recovery" by the public
commitment to create an official version of a past that must be remembered so
that it will not be repeated? Is it possible to make a meaningful distinction
between paranoid and reparative forms of national recovery?

The prime historical examples we will consider are post-apartheid South
Africa, the post-slavery US, post-genocide Rwanda, and Post-Holocaust Germany,
Israel, and the US. In conjunction with particular issues we will also touch
upon post-authoritarian Latin America, post-Soviet Eastern Europe, and post-
militaristic Japan. Our overall approach, however, will be to use particular
national histories to explore the implicit moral logic of the promised
"Century of Never Again."

**Supplemental Readings and Resources:** Neil Kritz, ed., _Transitional
Justice,_ 3 vols., provides an essential compendium of documents and country
studies relevant to this course. Another useful resource is Naomi Roht-
Arriaza, _Impunity and Human Rights in International Law and Practice._ Rather
than assign these very costly books, I have included reference to the relevant
sections under the category of "Further Reading." The website for South
Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission (www.truth.org.za/) has debates
and speeches by the major participants, full transcripts of important
hearings, all official documents of the Commission, submissions by the major
SA political parties, links to their websites, and links to major South
African newspapers. The best searchable version of the TRC Report is available
at [www.struth.org.za/](http://www.struth.org.za/), which is maintained by the
original webmaster of the TRC site.

For students interested in other issues the Internet has vast in the field of
human rights and transitional justice. The following websites are excellent
places to start your research: University of Minnesota Human Rights Library
([www1.umn.edu/humanrts/](http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/)); Diana
([www.law.uc.edu/Diana/](http://www.law.uc.edu/Diana/)); UN Human Rights site
([www.un.org/rights/](http://www.un.org/rights/)); International Court of
Justice ([www.igc.org/cij/](http://www.igc.org/cij/)); European Court of Human
Rights ([www.dhcour.coe.fr/](http://www.igc.org/cij/)); Coalition for
International Justice ([www.icj-cij.org/](http://www.icj-cij.org/)); and AAAS
Science and Human Rights Program (<http://shr.aaas.org/dhr.htm>). The United
States Institute of Peace ([www.usip.org](http://www.usip.org)) sponsors
conferences and publications in this area. For a primer on human rights
research, see
([www.law.harvard.edu/programs/HRP/Publications/research.html](http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/HRP/Publications/research.html)).

**Requirements:** Attendance at lectures and sections is mandatory. Two formal
papers will be required (in addition to informal presentations in section).
The first essay (c. 5pp.) will be on some topic related to the
_conceptualization_ of transitional justice. As a final paper, students will
be expected to critically analyze the means by which some particular nation
has dealt with the issues addressed in the course. If you wish to write on
some relevant topic or nation not covered in the syllabus, please consult me
or your TA for approval and references. (I have a large indexed database of
bibliographical materials, and may be able to save you considerable time as
you begin your research.)

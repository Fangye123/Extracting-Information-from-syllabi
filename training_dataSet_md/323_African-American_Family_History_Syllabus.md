In this upper level seminar, we will explore selected topics in African
American family history from the formation of families during slavery to the
current debates about the structure of black families in urban ghettos.
Throughout the semester we will discuss different models for understanding
African American family history and the various debates that have
characterized the interpretation of that history. The course will examine the
conditions under which black families had to function during different
historical periods, how families adapted to difficult circumstances, the
diversity among families within the African American community, and the affect
of larger demographic, political and social changes on African American
families.

Throughout the semester we will focus on the project of undertaking historical
research on the family. What types of sources exist for writing histories of
African American families? How can we uncover the historical voices of peoples
who have often been silenced? Can we generalize from one person's experience
to a more inclusive history of family development? This is a work-intensive
course. Each student is required to write a significant research paper of
20-25 pages. There is also a reasonable amount of reading each week. The
readings have been chosen with three goals in mind: 1) To introduce students
to the history of African-American families; 2) To familiarize students with
the major historiographical debates in the field; and 3) To demonstrate the
various kinds of research methodologies that can be used to study family
history (from quantitative demographic studies to qualitative case studies of
single families).

Course Requirements:

  1. Attendance at the weekly class meetings and participation in class discussions is mandatory. If you must miss a class, you are expected to turn in a 4-5 page paper based on the readings for that week. If you miss more than one class without a medical excuse, you will be dropped from the class list. 
  2. Each student will be assigned two weeks during the semester to write short papers (no more than three pages) on the readings. These papers are due the Monday before class meets at 4:30 p.m. I will make copies for the class which will be available by Tuesday morning. All students are expected to read the papers on that week's topic before coming to class on Wednesday afternoon. These papers will serve as the launching point for our discussion. Students not writing 3-page papers are required to submit a reading response at the beginning of each class. These responses should be your informal reactions to the readings and should be no more than one page. They might focus on the connections between the readings, issues the readings raised for you, or questions that you felt the readings did not address or answer. Guidelines for these papers will be handed out in class. 
  3. The main requirement for the class is the 20-25 research paper on a topic of your choice related to African-American family history. These papers must be based on primary source research. As a class we will discuss how to do historical research and how to find secondary and primary sources on a given topic. Part of one of our class meetings will take place at Olin Library, where students will be introduced to the tools available for doing primary source research. In addition, there will be a variety of deadlines associated with the research paper throughout the semester: 

October 15: A prospectus for your research paper is due in class. This should
be a short statement of the you topic you will explore in your paper. We will
discuss the prospectus more in class.

November 5: A bibliography for your paper (including both secondary and
primary sources) is due in class.

December 3: Drafts of research papers are due in class. All students are
required to give a short oral presentation about their research in class
either on December 3 or December 10.

December 17: Final drafts of research papers are due by 10:00 a.m.

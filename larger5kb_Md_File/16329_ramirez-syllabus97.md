Welcome to the Chicano and Latino Literature Web page at UT. I think some
background history may help us to understand the terms "Chicano" and
"Latino,"how they differ from one another, and where they overlap. The history
of the word "Chicano" is both social and economic, and bears heavily on the
identities that we will be addressing in selected literature. First of all,
Mexicans living in what is now the Southwest became U.S. citizens after the
U.S.-Mexico War. In 1848, both countries signed the Treaty of Guadalupe
Hidalgo, which stated that Mexico would cede the Southwest to the United
States for $15 million. The U.S., in turn, promised to respect the cultural
and property rights of Mexicans living in the territory.

In spite of this agreement, more than a century passed, and most Mexican-
Americans remained in the same vexed position they were immediately after the
War--without land. During the 20th-century, Mexican Americans embarked on a
renewed struggle for land with the United Farm Workers Movement. Fighting
against diverse forms of discrimination and institutionalized racism, Mexican
Americans, many of whom who by the 1960s identified themselves as Chicano,
created both grass roots and national organizations to reclaim their property
rights and, in many ways, their cultural heritage.

At various points in time, Mexican-Americans have been called Hispanic,
Chicano and, on Census forms, "other." The word Chicano, in particular, has
become celebratory and a term of resistance, but it also marks differences
between older Mexican Americans and a younger, more political generation.

If the term Chicano refers to a political and cultural movement,then the term
Latino may be considered a more general term that includes immigrant and many
kinds of Spanish-speaking populations. Latinos may be Mexican Americans, or
Cuban-American exiles, Puerto Rican translocators, Guatemalen political
refugees, or even South American immigrants, such as my family and myself.

As we shall see in this course, the debates over land, class, language, and
self-expression continue for both the Chicano and Latino people. In order to
acknowledge the complexities of Chicano and Latino writers, and especially
their complicated engagement with mainstream American culture, I first situate
the syllabus within a Latin American context. The course is then divided
thematically into four parts. **Part I: The Americas** offers critical
perspectives of Spanish colonialism and points to the constructed nature of
history. In **Part II** , we read the work of Peruvian writer Jose Mariategui
and Cuban critic Roberto Retamar in order to explore how issues of race,
class, and land are manifest in selected literary texts. In **Part III** , we
look at representations of gender in the home and in the community. This
section is especially important because it shows similarities and differences
among Latino cultures-- Mexican-American, Cuban-American, and Dominican-
American.

We "conclude" the course in **Part IV: BORDERS REAL AND IMAGINED**. Students
complete two main projects: the family narrative and research essay. The
former gives rhetorical validity to personal experiences and individual
voices; the latter offers students an opportunity to participate in a pre-
existing discourse about Chicano and Latino subjectivity.

A packet of readings available at Pennysaver Press, 177 Margaret Street,
563-0100.  
**Course Objectives** |  After taking this course students will be able to:

  * Describe the political nature of mathematics and mathematics education.
  * Describe gender and race differences in mathematics and their sociological consequences.
  * Examine the factors influencing gender and race differences in mathematics.
  * Critically evaluate eurocentrism and androcentrism in mathematics.
  * Describe the role culture plays in the development and learning of mathematics.
  * Give examples of the historical role of women and people of color in mathematics.
  * Critically evaluate research on the relationship of gender and culture to mathematics and mathematics education.

  
  
**Course Requirements**

**Attendance** |  Students will be allowed 2 absences only. Each absence over
2 will lower a student's final grade by 2 percentage points. To have an
absence excused a student must receive permission from me either before the
absence, or in case of emergency, _before_ the next class. It is then the
student's responsibility to ask for extra work to make up for the missed
class. Excused absences will count for 1/2 absence  
---|---  
**Online Discussion Forum (5 points each week)** |  Each student will be
required to take part in an online discussion forum available though the
course website. The purpose of this discussion forum is for you to express
their thoughts and feelings about the course and the material you are
learning, to maintain communication among the instructor and the members of
the class, and to facilitate discussion of the issues raised by the class.

Your discussion post should focus on the reading and class discussions, giving
your personal reactions to the material. You are expected to read the majority
of the postings on the discussion list. You may choose to reply to any
posting.

Postings totaling 15 lines are required from each student by Friday midnight
of each week.

In your first posting, tell a bit about yourself, such as, why you are taking
this course, what expectations you have of this course, what are your
interests in this course, etc.  
**Reading Quizzes (5 points each)** |  Each class will begin with a short
reading comprehension quiz covering all the readings assigned for that day.
Notes may be used for these quizzes. Discussions of the readings will be based
on the quizzes.  
**Group Activities (20 points each)** |  Students will be placed in groups of
3-5 people four times throughout the semester. These groups will be given
problems that require the development of a mathematical solution. Each group
will then derive a solution and write a summary describing their solution and
the process they went through to derive the solution. Each student will also
write an individual 2-3 page reaction paper to the group problem solving
process. More information on the required paper will be given later.  
**Math Auto-  
biography  (20 points)** | Write a 2-3 page paper describing your experiences
with mathematics throughout your life. Begin with your earliest memories of
mathematics and continue up to the present. Think about your experiences both
in and out of a formal classroom setting. Do not just describe what courses
you have taken but also how you felt about and experienced mathematics.  
**Biography Presentation (20 points)** | Choose a mathematician (or cultural
group of mathematicians) who are not white male. Research their lives.
Prepare a one-page summary of your paper to use in a 3-5 minute presentation.
Your summary must contain a bibliography of all sources you use.  
**Ethno-  
mathematics Research Papers (20 points each)** |  During the semester you must
research and read six articles that give examples of ethnomathematics. You
will then write a 2-3 page summary and critique of each article you read. More
information on the requirements for the critiques will be given in a separate
sheet. Due dates for the six article critiques are as follows: | First Article
Critique | February 13  
---|---  
Second Article Critique | February 27  
Third Article Critique | March 27  
Fourth Article Critique | April 10  
Fifth Article Critique | May 1  
Sixth Article Critique | May 10  
**Ethno-  
mathematics Project  (20 points)** | This project will require you to make or
do and explain some form of ethnomathematics for presentation in class. This
must be an example of mathematics in a non-academic setting. For example you
may wish to look to your own daily life and present the ethnomathematics
within some aspect of your own culture. Or you may wish to recreate or adapt
one of the ethnomathematics concepts developed within this class. Your example
of ethnomathematics will be presented in class. You will be required to write
a 2-3 page paper describing your project. More information on the required
paper will be given later.  
**Midterm Exam (40 points)** | Take home midterm.  
**Final Exam (80 points)** | Take-home final exam. Due at final exam period.  
**Note** |  All papers, including the midterm and final exams, must be typed
and will be graded for proper written English and spelling. All citations and
references must be given in APA style. See the bibliography at the end of this
syllabus for examples. In addition, with the exception of the final exam, you
may earn a rebate of up to 50% of the points taken off on any such assignment.
To do this you must rewrite the entire assignment and resubmit it along with
the original graded assignment. This must be turned in within one week of the
date that the original assignment was returned to you. The rewritten
assignment will then be graded. One-half of the difference between the scores
on the rewritten work and your original work will be added to your score for
that assignment.  
**Letter Grades** |  Grades will be determined according to the following
scale: | Grade | A | A- | B+ | B | B- | C+ | C | C- | D+ | D  
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
Percent | 90 | 87 | 83 | 80 | 77 | 73 | 70 | 67 | 63 | 60

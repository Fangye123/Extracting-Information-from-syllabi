**DEVELOPMENT OF A SYLLABUS**

  
This module is designed to take the place of a formal presentation in the
Instructional Effectiveness Program (IEP). It is available free for use by all
faculty, students, and staff at Oklahoma State University. All participants
who wish to obtain credit or a certificate for IEP and who wish to count this
module, as part of their work must complete the activities related to this
module.  
  
**Participation Requirements** : Access to a computer, which has Internet
access, and email capability is necessary. All IEP modules are product based
so you should expect to create products as the result of completing this
module.

Questions about your teaching philosophy  

**DEVELOPMENT OF A SYLLABUS**  

  
**Purpose of a Syllabus:** The syllabus is like a good  "Owner's Manual" which
provides answers to many of the questions which students will have about how
they are to proceed in the course. It also sets the tone for interaction by
showing how you expect students to respond in class. At least implicitly it
provides an indication of the instructor's philosophy of teaching and view of
students in the learning process. The syllabus provides an organizer for the
content in the course and shows how the material in the course logically flows
together. It provides information to students about rules and procedures for
the conduct of the course and serves as a contract between the instructor and
the students related to the instructor's expectations about performance an
behavior in a number of roles and settings. The syllabus should contain all of
the required components which are applicable to the course. These components
may be included in a list distributed annually by the administration. Include
all that the institution requires. You should try to include as much
information as is possible in the syllabus if you wish students to be fully
informed and if you wish to decrease the number of interpretations of policy
you will have to make in office hours as the semester progresses.  
  
The next three items and the attachment at the end of this document are
policies of Oklahoma State University and should be followed in the
development of syllabi.  
  
MEMORANDUM  
  
TO: General Faculty and Other Teaching Staff  
  
FROM: Marvin S. Keener  
  
SUBJECT: Distribution of Semester Course Plan  
  
The Policy Statement on University Academic Format urges all faculty  
members "to provide students with a semester course plan showing the schedule  
of examinations and other requirements, as well as details of the grading
system  
which will be used in the determination of final grades." Distribution of
written  
plans at the beginning of a course may alleviate some of the communication  
problems which occur between faculty and students concerning course  
requirements, examinations, grading procedures, and other matters.  
  
If you are not in the habit of doing so, I strongly urge you to adopt the  
practice of distributing a semester course plan in the first meeting of each
of your  
courses. Included in this booklet is a brief semester plan format recommended
by  
the Faculty Council. Additionally, the Student Government Association has  
requested that all instructors include a copy of the drop and add policy in
their  
syllabi. I would also encourage you to include the list of important dates for
the  
Spring 1997 semester that are listed on page 4 of this memorandum.  
  
Let me thank you in advance for your cooperation in providing students with  
this information. Do not hesitate to contact my office should you have
questions  
or concerns. Best wishes for a productive semester.  
  
MSK:mdh  
  
**Prefinals Week** :The Prefinals Week Policy(Policy & Procedures Letter
2-0210) is strictly enforced. Any deviation from this policy requires the
approval of your Department Head, Dean and the Executive Vice President. The
applicable regulations follow:  
1.01 Final examinations are scheduled at the end of each semester and are  
preceded by prefinals week which shall begin seven (7) days prior to the first
day  
of finals.  
1.02 During prefinals week, all normal class activities will continue;
however, no  
assignment, test, or examination accounting for more than 5% of the course
grade  
may be given; and no activity or field trip may be scheduled that conflicts
with  
another class. This excludes make-up and laboratory examinations, out-of-class  
assignments (or projects) made prior to prefinals week, and independent study  
courses.  
1.03 During prefinals week no student or campus organization may hold  
meetings, banquets, receptions, or may sponsor or participate in any activity,  
program, or related function which requires student participation.  
  
  
**Freshman Progress Reports & Keeping Students Informed**: According to the
OSU Catalog, "The faculty will report grades for all freshmen on the dates as
printed in the official University Calendar." For the ______semester, these
grades are due to the Registrar on________[dates and semesters will vary].
Faculty are also encouraged to give all students a reasonable indication of
their progress by this date. It is also very important to communicate to your
students, preferably in writing, any changes in the semester course plan.  
  
**Table of Contents** : If the syllabus is long you should provide a table of
contents. This allows the student to easily access the material that he/she
needs. Listed below are the possible components of a regular syllabus in table
of contents form. Each of these components will be described and some examples
will be provided. Note that the starred components are required and the
unstarred components are optional. Note also that the presentation sequence is
arbitrary.

Summary  
Syllabus attachment  
Questions about your teaching philosophy  
  
  
**Components of a Traditional Syllabus**

  
**COURSE INFORMATION**  
  
**Name of University, Year, and Semester:** This is valuable to the students
if they have to refer back to the course when applying it to a degree
elsewhere. It is valuable to you so that you can look back and see how you
have developed a course over the years. This is particularly important for the
teaching portfolio.  
  
***Course Prefix, Number, and Title:** The course prefix, number, and title
tell the student that he/she is in the correct course. Numbers may be the same
across departments, but prefixes will change. It is always important to insure
that the student knows what document he/she is in, particularly if there are
many similar documents available on the university server or if the student is
taking a number of courses in the same department. Some universities use a
common syllabus format and template and it is difficult to distinguish one
course from another except by the course number and prefix.  
  
**Building and Room Number in which the Class Meets:** It is a continual
amazement that many students cannot find their way back to the classroom after
the first day of class. If the building and room number are on the syllabus it
increases their chances of showing up for the second and following classes.  
  
***Prerequisite, Co-requisite, and Support Courses:** The students should know
right at the beginning if there are other courses which they should have had
before they attempt the course or if there are courses in which they should be
concurrently enrolled. Be sure to list both those in the catalogue and those
that you assume that they have had, even if they are not required. The latter
are sometimes important because you may assume knowledge, which is not
available to some of the students  
  
**INSTRUCTOR INFORMATION**  
  
***Instructor's Name, Office Address, and Office Hours:** The instructor's
name and office hours tell the student who the teacher is and when he/she can
be contacted. Office addresses are important when students are unfamiliar with
the campus. If you office is well hidden, you may want to provide a map so
students can find you. In some courses with some students, the instructor may
also need to spend some space convincing students that coming to office hours,
in person or by telephone, does not brand them as slow. Learners, in our
competitive society, needing help or assistance may see the receipt of that
help as a sign that they are weak or incompetent. To avoid this stigma they
may not seek help when it is needed. Note that if you are the instructor for
the class and also a teaching assistant you should list the name, phone, and
office number of your supervising faculty member. Specify if appointments
needed during office hours or if they are on a first come, first served basis.  
  
***Telephone Numbers (Office and Home):** Students should be able to contact
the instructor in his/her office or leave a message either with a secretary or
on voice mail. You may also wish to include your home telephone number. An
example telephone statement might say,  "Please feel free to call me during
office hours with any questions you have about the course, homework, readings,
or any other problems that you have. I will treat these calls like any other
office visit (If I am with someone, I will call you back). Please also feel
free to call at other times if you have a pressing problem. If I am not in you
will get my secretary [or voice mail] and I will return your call as soon as
possible. You will notice that I have included my home telephone number. You
may call between 8 AM and 10 PM if you have pressing problems which will not
wait for office hours, e.g., you need information for the exam tomorrow. If I
am not at home you will get my voice mail [answering machine]" If you do not
have an answering machine or service be sure to note this. If you are not
provided with a university phone, provide a number where students can leave
messages for you. This will usually be with the departmental secretary. You
will probably want to include your personal or departmental fax number,
particularly if you have deadlines for the receipt of papers, homework and the
like and you have nontraditional students in the class who may want to send
papers from work.  
  
**Email Address:** We assume that instructors will also provide email
addresses. The more frequently the instructor is available, the lower
students' stress levels will be and the less delay they will experience in
developing the materials, which are needed for completion of the course.
Remember that a question unresolved usually means that the student is stuck
until resolution. List days (Saturday and/or Sunday) when email will not be
checked so students will know when to expect a response. You may also want to
list your home email or you may want to set up a separate mailbox or account
for each class. If you do this indicate how often you will check the mail.  
  
**Expectations (Instructor)** : The instructor should spell out any
expectations, which are held about the behavior of students or the development
of products. The more the students know about what is expected the more likely
the instructor is to get it and the more likely the students are to feel that
they are successful. This means that requirements, formats, styles used,
problem structures, report formats, etc., must be spelled out in detail. When
possible provide a checklist if the process contains many steps. The better
the product is described the happier the instructor will be with the eventual
result. Teachers should make participation expectations clear and model
responsiveness. The expectations can be set either by the teacher or during a
brainstorming session where the students talk about what must be done to set
up an environment in which all can be optimally productive.  
  
**Typical Amount of Work Expected in the Course:** You should expect students
to invest, on average three hours of out of class time for each hour of in
class time. Students should be informed of this expectation. For example,  "It
is expected that you will need to spend about nine hours per week outside of
class preparing for this three credit course. Some will find that this amount
of time is not adequate because they are slower readers or writers than others
in the class. The homework and readings have been designed to be accomplished
in about that amount of time."  
  
**COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
  
**Course Purpose/Preamble** : The course purpose or preamble is a statement
which describes why a course exists in terms which can motivate the learners.
It should include answers to the following questions:  
， Why does this course exist?  
， Where does it fit into the curriculum?  
， Is it related to accreditation standards? [For whom?]  
， How does the course fit into the goals of the program?  
， How does the course support the university's mission?  
， Who are the students who usually take the course?  
An example preamble follows, "This course, the Psychology of Learning, is
designed to provide you with both the developmental history of learning theory
and the most current applications of that theory in classrooms, organizations,
and therapeutic settings. The course should be at least your fourth in
educational psychology at the undergraduate and graduate levels. It is one of
several courses taken by teachers to further understanding of the ways in
which children and adults learn in classroom settings .It is also taken by
those who conduct training in corporate settings to help them, plan learning
opportunities for both short and long term training. The course is taken by
psychologists who will use it's content in schools, agencies, and therapeutic
settings. Psychologists who are seeking liscensure will recognize that this
course meets APA requirements for breadth in psychology. Finally the course is
required for all in the educational psychology track. This course therefore is
a service course for many and a requirement for a few. Because of this we will
focus our explorations on the needs and interests of those who are enrolled in
the class."  
  
***Course Objectives:** In a typical syllabus where the teacher determines
what the students will learn, the course objectives should be stated and an
outline of the content to be covered should be presented. This is helpful for
the student as it shows clearly what the course is supposed to be about.
Objectives usually are called goals and are more general in courses where
students have some control over the content that they will explore. Control
based systems will have objectives, usually based in Bloom's Taxonomy (Bloom
et al. 1956). Choice based courses will list the purposes for which the course
was created so that learners can have some direction in selecting among the
offerings. Typically, choice based learners will not partake of all of the
purposes unless they are highly interested.  
  
***Course Outline:** The course outline is a linear sequence of the major
topics which will be examined in the course. It will probably also develop a
rationale for the sequence as it has been developed.  
  
***Style/Mode of Teaching (Course Structure)** : No matter what kind of course
is presented the instructor needs to spell out how the course will be
conducted. Instructors need to specify very precisely what the structure is
(unless it is the computer is used as a lecture vehicle), because the learners
are unlikely to be familiar with all the other approaches. A good approach
here is to write a clear and succinct description of what the learners will be
doing, and then have all of the difficult words/concepts or those that the
learners might not know in the description, linked to definitions or
explanations.  
  
**Purpose of Class Meetings** : There are a number of purposes for holding
classes. You should describe your intent either in a separate section or as
part of the section on course structure. Class meetings can be conducted to do
any of the following singly or in combination [note that this list is not
exhaustive]:  
， Teach information  
， Provide background for readings/projects/experiments  
， Extend readings  
， Clarify readings  
， Apply readings  
， Create products/projects  
， Demonstrate skills  
， Perform (music, plays, etc.)  
， Conduct experiments  
， Participate in activities  
  
**List of Key Concepts:** The list of key concepts is like a glossary of
terms. It defines the terms and provides a set of examples. Concept lists are
helpful because learners do not have to pose questions to the group or the
instructor when they do not understand. This saves time and insures that the
shy students will have some idea of what the terms mean.  
  
**Statement to Cover Possible Changes in the Syllabus:** The syllabus is a
contract between the instructor and the students and therefore it will not be
modified except in writing. The teacher should not modify the syllabus in any
way that will make the students at risk, e.g., changing exam dates, number of
assignments, etc. unless the change reduces the amount of work for the
students and it has been discussed in class. An example statement (Appleby,
1994),  "The above schedule and procedures in this course are subject to
change in the event of extenuating circumstances." Any changes will be provide
in writing and will be posted on the bulletin board for those who are absent.
You should check the bulletin board if you are absent.  
  
**Instructional Technology Access and Prerequisites** : What kinds of
computers, calculators, etc., must the student have access to? What must the
student be able to do technologically to succeed in the course, e.g., use the
Internet, use SPSS-X, use EXCEL, etc.  
  
**Course Calendar:** The course calendar is a daily or weekly schedule which
lists all of the events which relate to the course. It should list the class
meetings, discussion meetings [if you have discussion sections], review
sessions, laboratory sessions, field trips, special events [e.g., go to here a
speaker on campus at a non-class time], holidays, drop dates, etc. Vacation
days (fall and spring breaks), known times that the instructor will be out of
town, deadlines for projects, papers, homework. A sample course calendar is
illustrated below.

**INSTRUCTOR EXPECTATIONS/INFORMATION**  
  
**Educational Beliefs** : What are your educational beliefs about:  
， Students  
， The purpose of education  
， The role of teaching  
  
**Expectations of Scholarship** : What are your expectations for scholarship
among your students? The level of expectations will vary from regular to
honors classes and from upper to lower division classes. Graduate classes
should have even higher expectations. It is a good practice to articulate your
expectations to the students so that they can conform to your desires.
Remembers if you have expectations and the students do not live up to them it
is their fault, if and only if they knew what your expectations were.  
  
**Special Instructions:** There are many special instructions which you may
want to give to students which would have them do things which are not
regularly required. For example:  
， Permission of the instructor is required for enrollment in this class  
， All students are to come to my office at least once during office hours in
the first three weeks of class  
， Students need to consult with me before a project is selected.  
， Paper topics need to be cleared with the instructor before the paper is
written  
， Laboratory projects need prior instructor approval  
， Students are responsible for arranging their own transportation to the
designated or assigned site [Always include this unless the university has
agreed to provide liability insurance. This agreement should be in writing or
a university vehicle should be used.]  
  
**Required Special Events** : If there are special events which you want
students to attend these should be listed in the course calendar and also
separately so that they will stand out for the students. Special events are
any events which are required but are not during the regularly schedules class
time. These might include:  
， Field trips  
， Special lectures or presentations at times other than the class  
， Conferences on campus  
， Judging events  
  
**INFORMATION ABOUT** **ASSIGNMENTS**  
  
**Explanation of the Purpose of Projects or Assignment:** What should the
students gain from these? How do the projects/assignments relate to things
that the students will do in the real world when they get jobs in the field?
Are there direct correspondences between class work and job or between class
work and what will be done in later classes? Can this learning be referred to
on a resume? You should be able to provide justification for all projects,
exercises, homework, etc. and you should be able to do this up front in the
syllabus (at least in general terms) and when the projects are presented to
the students in more detail. There are a number of questions that the teacher
should try to answer when developing assignments (Roe, 1985). What is the
purpose of the assignment? Is the assignment the best or most appropriate way
of developing the skill? Are the students aware of the purpose of the
assignment? The students will do better and will work harder on an assignment
if they know why it is used, what they are supposed to gain from it, and how
this will help them in the real world. Is learning expected from the
assignment, or is it merely practice over material which is already known? If
learning is expected, do the students know what it is that they are supposed
to learn? How can the teacher insure that learning takes place? Are the
expectations clear? Do the students know the point value of the assignment and
how this relates to the overall grade in the course? What assistance will the
instructor, provide? Is there reference material available if it is needed for
the assignment? Are the assessment criteria clear, or is self-assessment used?  
  
**Guidelines for Writing Reports. Papers, Reviews** : At a minimum include the
style manual you want them to use. A more detailed description might look like
this:

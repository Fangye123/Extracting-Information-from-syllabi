# Overview

**Texts**

**Required**  
1\. **_But is it Art? A Very Short Introduction to Art Theory_ ** , Cynthia A.
Freeland. **Good News! The books arrived and were in the bookstore as of the
afternoon of 1/15/02. I checked there myself. So you can get one there. You
can also get it on BarnesandNoble.com. And, a student reported that he got it
at Rother's and they had two or three left there, too.**  
For some selections, see [the sample
page](http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/aesth/OUP.html). Published Spring 2001 by
Oxford University Press; paperback version forthcoming in around March 2002.
The book can be ordered, and a number of pages sampled, [on
Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0192100556/qid=1008859997/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_14_1/104-1453971-5719951)
(Sometimes they advertise cheaper used copies on there). Chapters listed on
syllabus from "Freeland" are from this book. You will be among the first group
of students to use this new book.

2\. **_Aesthetics: The Big Questions_** , (ABQ), ed. Carolyn Korsmeyer
(Blackwell, 1998)

**Recommended**  
**1\. Robert Cumning, _Art: The World's Greatest Paintings Explored and
Explained_ , DK Publishing, 1995.** (This book is recommended to give you an
excellent introduction to the interpretation of meaning and symbolism in
paintings, with detailed studies of a number of great paintings in western art
history.)

**2\. Carol Strickland, John Boswell, _The Annotated Mona Lisa: A Crash Course
in Art History_ , Andrews McMeel Publishing, 1992. ** (This book is highly
recommended to give you a clear introduction to western art history from
ancient Egypt up through modernism and post-modernism. If you don't know the
difference between Impressionism, Expressionism, and Abstract Expressionism,
but would like to, this book is for you.)

**Warning**  
Some art to be shown and discussed in class may offend some students. This
includes artwork that addresses themes about religion, race and racism,
sexuality, violence, and gender identity.

**Requirements and Grading**  
Grading is done on a scale based on 100 points total. No in-class exams or
final.

**Explanation and comments:**  
Participation: Quality, quantity; but note, lots and loud is not necessarily
"good." Attendance is also relevant to this score. While class attendance is
not required, if you miss a class you are most likely to miss seeing or
hearing some illustrations that are relevant to the assigned readings and
essays, and this is quite likely to hurt your performance.

pages, marked on grammar and spelling as well as content, topics announced 1

**Topics and Course Plan ** For details of schedule and assignments, refer to
the [Class Schedule](Schedule.html).

  * ####  Chapter 1. Blood and Beauty 

[See also Art Links1 page.](ArtLinks1.html) Aesthetics is not just a study of
pretty, safe, and established museum art; it involves interpreting and
evaluating the live arts as they happen today.

  * #### Freeland Chapter 2. Paradigms and Purposes 

[See also Art Links2 page](ArtLinks2.html) This chapter is an overview of the
history of aesthetics focusing on key paradigms of art that have been offered
by philosophers over the centuries (tragedy, gardens, operas, Andy Warhol's
"Brillo Box," etc.).

  * #### Freeland Chapter 3. Cultural Crossings 

[See also Art Links3 page.](ArtLinks3.html) Cultural expression in the arts
has always reflected cross-cultural contact, so the "global society" is not as
new as it is sometimes made out to be.

  * #### Freeland Chapter 4. Money, Markets, Museums 

[See also Art Links4 page.](ArtLinks4.html) We shall examine the relation
between aesthetic value and other forms of recognition in the art market and
the museum, considering aesthetic, commercial, and spiritual value.

  * #### Freeland Chapter 5. Gender, Genius, and Guerrilla Girls 

[See also Art Links5 page.](ArtLinks5.html) In looking at an artwork, is the
gender or sexual orientation of the artist important?

  * #### Freeland Chapter 6. Cognition and Creation 

[See also Art Links6 page.](ArtLinks6.html)  
If art has meaning, then can we sum up that meaning in words? How?

  * #### Freeland Chapter 7. Digitizing and Disseminating 

[See also Art Links7 page.](ArtLinks7.html)  
We can tour the Louvre on CD-ROM and visit many major museum exhibitions on
the Web, but is there a difference between the real and the virtual? What?

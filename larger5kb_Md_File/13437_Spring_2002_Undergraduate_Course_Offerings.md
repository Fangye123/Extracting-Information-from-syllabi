Do they really exist? What do we mean by "civil" rights? This course will interrogate the concept of rights and explore concepts of freedom and conscience. We will read, discuss, and respond in writing to some of the important historical texts of political freedom and discuss their applicability to civil rights issues. Basically the course will be a history of ideas that approach the concept of rights, including discussions of current issues of human rights around the world.

The assignments for this portion of the course are based on the premise that to be a good fiction writer one must first be a perceptive reader and critic. The class will gradually evolve into a workshop, with student stories-in-progress providing the primary material for discussion. Each student will write and revise two short stories. One story will be narrated in first person, the other in third person. Only the final drafts will be graded. The remainder of your grade will be based on your performance in workshop. Workshop includes both class discussion and written critiques of each student author's manuscript. Critiques and story drafts will be included in a portfolio submitted at midterm and again at the end of the course. Authors will also receive private manuscript conferences with the instructor.

**ENGL 463 Introduction to Poetry Writing**  
Section A: MWF 11:30--C. Cokinos  
    This semester-long course will explore the essential elements necessary to creating and crafting poems. No previous experience in writing poetry is required. By the end of the course, you will be expected to have mastered such techniques as imagery, figurative language, slant rhyme, iambic pentameter, and other "language tools." We will proceed from two basic assumptions: 1.) that you are writing for others, not just for yourself; and 2.) that, even if you have written poetry before, you are interested in exploring new techniques. Take those assumptions to heart, and you will find the class challenging, rewarding--and fun. One of our hallmarks will be variety: we'll mix lectures, in-class writing, class discussions, guest readings, workshops, and field trips. You'll be expected to complete several poems, some assigned, some "open" format/subject--and most of them will be revised for improvement. As well, you'll be expected to complete reading and homework assignments on time and to participate energetically in class.  
    For those beginning the craft of poetry writing. A practical introduction to poetry. A prerequisite for all 600-level and above poetry writing courses. Prerequisite: ENGL 125 or 200.

**ENGL 463 Introduction to Poetry Writing**  
Section B: TU 2:05-3:20--E. Dodd

The course is an INTRODUCTION to poetry writing, and will include exercises, much reading of contemporary poetry, occasional quizzes over terms and vocabulary, and specific assignments to give students practice in the fundamentals of writing poetry. While no particular experience in writing poems is necessary, students should genuinely enjoy reading and writing. We'll focus on topics such as imagery, metaphor, meter, tone, concrete detail, and other elements vital to good poetry.

**ENGL 470 English Bible: Reading the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament**  
Section A: MWF 1:30--L. Behlman  
    The Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament) is a main source text not only for three major religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - but also for world literature. This class will introduce a range of literary and non-literary approaches to reading the Hebrew Bible (in translation) in order to account for its extraordinary richness and variety. Reading assignments will divide evenly between selections from critical sources and readings in the Hebrew Bible itself. The critical sources will include literary essays on formal aspects of the Bible, historical essays, linguistic criticism, and feminist criticism. Although our focus will for the most part be fixed firmly on the Hebrew Bible in its own historical context, we will spend some time near the end of the term addressing later Jewish, Christian, and Muslim ways of reading the Hebrew Bible.  
    Required Texts: Tanakh: _The Holy Scriptures_ (The JPS Bible), Robert Alter, _Genesis: Translation and Commentary_ (1996), Hershel Shanks, ed., _Ancient Israel_ (1999), Richard E. Friedman, _Who Wrote the Bible?_ (2nd ed., 1997), and a coursepack.  
    Requirements will include dedicated participation in class discussion, a 4-6 page paper, a 6-8 page paper, a mid-term, and a final exam.

**ENGL 620 Readings: 17th Century British Literature**  
Section A: MWF 2:30--M. Donnelly  
    This course presents a comprehensive survey of the literature, dramatic and non-dramatic, prose and poetry, of one of the most fruitful and varied periods of literary production in whole span of English literary history. Major figures include Donne and Jonson, Webster and Middleton, Sir Thomas Browne, Sir Francis Bacon, Robert Burton, Andrew Marvell, Dryden and Congreve. The literature of the period will be set in the context of social, cultural, and political developments in this particularly tumultuous time of social change, the century in which England seems to conclusively pass from the remaining forms, practices, and intellectual habits of the Middle Ages to the incipient culture and attitudes of the Early Modern Period, from Renaissance and Reformation to Enlightenment and Rationalism. Critical issues such as the problems of periodization, schools and influences, canonical and non-canonical texts, and historicism and New Historicism will be touched upon, as will the literature of "High Culture" and the Courts vs. an emerging popular literature (Bunyan, Civil War pamphlets) giving a voice and articulate sense of identity to social elements hitherto silent, marginalized, or spoken for in quite different works from the same periods is an unusual feature of the course, as well. An excellent opportunity to read works by some of the best and most influential writers in English (favorites of the Romantics and major writers of the American Renaissance, and central texts for Modernism through T. S. Eliot and F. R. Leavis's patronage), and to explore some central theoretical questions for literary history and criticism.

**ENGL 645 Readings in 19th Century American Literature: 19th-Century
Fiction**  
Section A: MWF 9:30--J. Machor  
    This course will examine the wide and diverse range of American fiction from the nineteenth-century, including selected works by canonical writers such as Hawthorne, Melville, Poe, Twain, Norris, Chopin, and James. Since important short stories and novels were written by figures less know today--often minority and women writers such as Charles Chesnutt, Mary Wilkins Freeman, Cahtherine Sedgwick, and Harriet Wilson--we will also be devoting attention to such neglected fiction both for its impact on the transformations in nineteenth-century fiction and its connections to the "major" writers. While attending to literary form and content, we will seek as well to place these texts within their larger social contexts to reach some understanding of the relation between cultural conditions and the changing contours of American fiction. Undergraduates will take a mid-term and a final exam and do one short (3-5 pp.) paper and one longer (8-10 pp.) paper. Graduate students will take the final, do an 8-10 page paper and a longer 15-20 page paper, and have one additional requirement determined by mutual agreement.

** Section A: W 4:30-6:50PM--I. Ward  
    This course introduces the history and major concepts of rhetorical theory. Rhetorical theory is closely linked to literary theory. It also explores the "art" of producing texts and tends to focus on "how" a text reveals meaning and less on "what" a text means.

**ENGL 799 Problems in English**

**ENGL 825 Seminar/Medieval Book**  
Section A: TU 2:05-3:20--G. Keiser  
    This course will make use of the library's rich collection of facsimiles, microfilms and early printed books to study the medieval book, primarily though not exclusively the English book, as an artifact of cultural history. The course will begin with some preliminary instruction in palaeography (i.e., learning to read medieval scribal hands), and then we will look at specific manuscripts and printed books to learn about their production, both the physical process and the exercise of judgment that went into the choice and variety of works copied into the books. All manuscripts are unique, and each tells us something, often a great deal about the interests and taste of the individual compiler and about the community of readers of which the scribe was a part. In the case of printed books, though they are mass-produced (in relatively small quantities), the fact is that the choice of texts is often a result of patronage and thus also a matter of the taste and interests of an individual and a larger community of readers. Among the areas of concern for the course are the transmission and circulation of writings, including those of Chaucer and Malory and the company their writings keep in manuscripts; the growth of readership among the middle classes, especially women; the burgeoning interest in devotional literature and in practical writings, such as works of medicine; the post-medieval preservation of medieval learning and culture despite the determined destruction of it by Protestant reformers; the fascination with the early book among antiquarians and printers in modern times; the challenge of editing texts from early books. Our culture is built in great part on the book, and it has been since its earliest days. By studying the book at a critical moment in our culture, that moment at which the need for printing led to its invention, we can learn a great deal about the foundation on which modern culture is built and its connection with its classical and medieval, secular and spiritual heritage.

**ENGL 825 Seminar in Nineteenth-Century American Literature and Culture:
Ideas, Activism, and the Arts**  
Section B: U 3:30-5:50--G. Eiselein

The reading includes long and short works by writers such as Jacobs, Stowe, Emerson, Bronson Alcott, Thoreau, Fuller, Peabody, Hawthorne, Whitman, Lazarus, Addams, William James, Louisa May Alcott, and Norris. The seminar will emphasize the careful, critical reading of literary texts in their social, cultural, and historical contexts. Course Requirements: active participation in seminar discussions, a class presentation, and a critical paper of 20-25 pages.

**ENGL 890 History of the English Language**  
Section A: T 3:30-5:50--T. Murray  
    This course provides a detailed survey of the many ways the English language has changed and developed over the past 1500 years. After acquiring the tools necessary to study linguistic change, we will first discuss the pre-history of English and how English is related to other of the world's languages, then turn our attention to the phonology, grammar, and lexicon of English as they have been influenced by forces both inside and outside the language. We'll also discuss the development of American English; the role prescriptivism has played in the development of the language; writing systems; and other related topics. Requirements for the course will include at least three exams, a longer written project (probably accompanied by an oral presentation), and occasional homework and in-class exercises.

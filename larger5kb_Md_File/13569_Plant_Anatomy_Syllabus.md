####  Objectives of the course:

  * To provide students with skills necessary to section and stain fresh plant material in preparation for study of plant anatomy.
  * To train students in the proper use of the compound light microscope and to give them experience in interpreting images that they see through the microscope in terms of how plant structure is related to function.
  * To instill in students an appreciation for the complexity of tissue organization that exists within plant bodies that allow plants to develop and live as integrated organisms in diverse environments.

####  Ways that this course can fit into your program:

  * This is a 3 credit hour laboratory course which:
    * Fullfills requirement V.C.  for A. B. degree in Botany.
    * Fullfills requirement V.C.  for B. S. degree in Botany.
    * Fullfills requirement V.C.  for B. S. with Environmental Science Emphasis degree in Botany.
    * Fullfills requirement IV.C. in Environmental Management and Forestry Duke-Miami Cooperative Program
    * Fullfills requirement e. in the Botany Minor with a theme of Conservation and the Environment
    * Fullfills requirement c. in the Botany Minor with a theme of Molecular Processes
  * Can be taken for graduate credit if you agree to all of the following additional requirements:
    * Enroll for at least 1 additional hour of BOT 700 or BOT 800 linked to this course
    * Complete an independent project that is **_pre-approved_** by **_the instructor_**

  * **Course Objectives (short version).**

Critical Thinking is an activity in which we all already engage. Most of us do
it in a fairly unskilled and erratic manner. This course is aimed to help
students become more reflectively aware of critical thinking and to practice
some of the basic skills needed to practice it well.

Note that I say I aim:

    * to make you more reflectively aware of thinking critically 
    * to practice some skills 

I consciously avoid claiming that I can TEACH this skill. I believe the
critical thinking "teacher" is sort of in the same position as a coach in a
sport. There are basic skills which most serious players will have seen and
tried, often adapting some version of these skills into their game. The coach
tries to point out, even name the various skills or "moves" and then works
with the players to practice the skills. But some will get them and some not,
and while discipline, commitment, seriousness of purpose and such things are
great virtues and help in considerable measure, critical thinking, like
sports, is not something at which a teacher/coach can guarantee success.

I say a good deal more about the details of these skills in a longer essay. [

  * **Readings**

We will read a several short pieces by Corbett about various critical skills,
and a three essays which are NOT about critical thinking, but which we will
use for practice. [ I will post all readings to my web site ](critical.html)
and you will not have any materials to purchase.

  * **Course Requirements and Grading**

Grading: While I will grade each individual assignment, the grade of the
course will not be merely the sum of the individual grades. Rather, I will
take into account an overall sense of quality in the general tone of one's
work. However, the sum of one's individual grades will certainly be a strong
indication of where one stands. In a rough sense the assigments will be valued
in this fashion:

Grading

    * Attendance: This will be only a negative possibility. You begin will full credit. 
      * If you miss more than 2 class your grade will be lowered one full letter grade. 
      * If you miss more than 3 classes your grade will be lowered two full letter grades. 
      * If you miss more than 4 classes your grade will be lowered three full letter grades. 
      * If you miss 6 classes you will receive a grade of F. 
      * Special note on being late:  Our class begins at 10 AM, sharp. That doesn't not mean 10:01 or after. I will count everyone present who is in the room at 10 AM when we begin. Others will be counted as late. Were a person to be more than 10 minutes late then they are regarded as having missed the entire first hour, and will be counted as having missed 1/2 class. Three grades of late (that is, late at all, but less than 10 minutes late) will count as having missed an entire 1/2 class. 
      * Special note on breaks.I will give a TEN MINUTE break near mid-class. I have had serious problems in classes in Vienna in starting up again after 10 minutes. At EXACTELY 10 minutes after the break begins I will once again take attendance and the same policy will be used as at the beginning of class. More than three times being at ALL late in return, counts as having missed an entire 1/2 class, and being more than 10 minutes late from break also counts as having missed the entire hour and will thus count as 1/2 missed class. 

IMPORTANT NOTE: Given that this is a class in which a great deal of the work
is done in class sessions of discussion and working on essays in common, if
you are not a student who can be on-time for class and in returning from 10
MINUTES break, or who cannot attend class always, the PLEASE, spare yourself a
lot of difficulty and do not take this class.

    * General work required and graded 
      * Questions on the texts: 30% 
      * Paper on Corbett's essays: 10% 
      * Analytic papers: 20% 
      * Critical papers: 20% 
      * [General contribution to class discussion: 20%](class-participation.html)
      * total: 
      * ......................100% 

Three important additional notes:

    * I will only give a grade of incomplete in a very unusual circumstance, one in which the student was doing all work in a timely and acceptable fashion and then some major catastrophe strikes, one for which the student can give evidence of and which is seriously debilitating. Even then, an incomplete would be negotiated toward the shortest reasonable time to fulfill the work with no extensions. In only the rarest occasions would a grade for a fulfilled incomplete ever be higher than a C. 
    * Alternative grading procedure is possible:  Were any student unhappy with the above grading procedure, the student is welcome to begin discussion with Corbett toward forming an alternative grading procedure. This would take an initial discussion with the Corbett which would be initiated by the student. Were an agreement reached then the student has the responsibility to write up the new grading contract and have it signed by both Corbett and the student. Such a contract would have to be signed and finished, and a copy given to Corbett, before the third week of classes had ended. 
    * A statement on plagiarism. Plag1arism is turning in any written work as one's own which was written by someone else. This is a completely unacceptable behavior in the academic world and is counted as a clear case of cheating. Any student caught plagiarizing in this class will be given an F for the entire course. No second chances will be given. The policy is firm and absolute.

taught, papers are critiqued mid-term, and students are able to rewrite.

Prof. Spitzer, chair, reports that all of the courses, with the exception of
language courses in Hebrew and Yiddish, require a good deal of writing -- from
short essays to long research papers. Students generally receive substantial
feedback on their work, both about content and writing. Please check out the

arguments.

longer self-analyses. Course syllabus specifically addresses

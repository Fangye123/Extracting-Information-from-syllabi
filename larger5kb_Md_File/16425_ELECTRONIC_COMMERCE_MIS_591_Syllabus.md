## Class Project

Each class participant is required to develop a home page for a unit of an
organization (the unit should not currently have a home page). This page
should perform at least one specific function, for example; customer support,
marketing, etc. You may contact any private or public sector organization
about the possibility of developing their home page. Potential units could
also include a unit of the University, such as an academic or a business unit.
This home page should be accessible from your own home page.  
  
There are many examples of home pages from various businesses for you to
browse before you start this project. Different state agencies have also
developed home pages. For example, you may want to browse the [Illinois
Environmental Protection Agency](http://www.epa.state.il.us/) or the [State of
Illinois](http://www.state.il.us/) Home Pages.  
  
To allow maximum creativity, no other restriction is imposed on this
assignment by the instructor. However, note that this project will be
evaluated based on its quality, quantity, and your creativity. Please

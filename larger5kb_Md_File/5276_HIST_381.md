### Contacting the Professor

**Office Location:** 221 Randall Hall.

**Office Hours:** Tu Th 3:30-4:30, _and by arrangement_. You should not feel
confined to my scheduled office hours. An efficient means of arranging
appointment times is by emailing me, at
[Megill@virginia.edu;](mailto:megill@virginia.edu) but because it is sometimes
hard for me to connect to email from off grounds, it is best to email me a day
or two in advance. **Note:** Sometimes I may have to cancel office hours
because of other obligations. It is helpful, therefore, to contact me ahead of
time even if you plan to come during regularly scheduled hours. _

**_Telephone Numbers:** office, 924-6414 (voicemail after several rings if
there is no answer); home, 971-8744 (answering machine after several rings;
you shouldn't hesitate to phone me at home--if we are otherwise occupied we
generally don't answer the phone; but avoid 5 pm- 8 pm, and don't phone later
than 10:30 pm).

The schedule is based on previous offerings of the course, especially those of
fall semesters 1992 and 1993: but the course will likely be quite
significantly modified in practice, because in the interim I have done a great
deal of additional thinking about the subject matter. I should note in
particular that the timing of reading assignments is subject to change. Hence,
you cannot rely on this schedule to determine with certainty when a particular
assignment will actually be made.

The course requires thinking, not the mere regurgitation of lecture material:
_what I most look for is evidence that you have directly struggled with the
readings_. Usually I avoid giving simple, merely historical information in my
lectures. You can get the story of Marx's life from David McLellan, _Karl
Marx: His Life and Thought_ (unfortunately out of print, but available on
reserve). The standard, even indispensable survey of German history in Marx's
period is James J. Sheehan, _German History, 1770-1866_.

### Syllabus

**1/Th Sept 4/97**. Introduction. Why study Marx now? After all, Marxism as a
practical political force has collapsed. And there seem to be at least two
problems with Marx's theory: (a) he underestimated the importance of politics;
and (b) he rejected the market, without providing a satisfactory alternative.
So why study Marx? Several answers will be provided.

Some crucial passages in Marx: On freedom: _The German Ideology_ , _Marx-
Engels Reader_ , pp. 197, 200; _Socialism" Utopian and Scientific_ , _MER_ ,
717. Against "anarchy of production," _MER_ , 717. How to tie together
commitment to freedom and commitment to planning? Marx's conception of
rationality.

First reading assignment and "think" question: _Marx-Engels Reader_ , 3-6
("1859 Preface") (also in _Early Writings_ , 424- 28). What are the main
concepts that Marx mentions in the 1859 Preface, and how do they fit together?
Note that p. 5, l. 6, "can be determined with the precision of natural
science," is better translated as "can be observed with natural-scientific
objectivity." **Copy Collected Works (reserve HX39.5.A16 1975), vol. 1, 10-21,
84-87, 109-17, 195-202, 211-14.**

**2/Tu, Sept 91/97**. Marx's relation to Hegelian philosophy, sketched out
briefly. His doctoral dissertation (ca 1839-41) was on the philosophies of
nature of Democritus and Epicurus: significance thereof? Embedded
rationality/embedded progress. Criteria of rationality: universality,
necessity, predictability, progress by contradiction. Marx, too, wants to
grasp the universal. He started out as a law student, aiming toward a
bureaucratic position (at least, that was his father's hope); but his real
interest was philosophy. (Later, you might wish to read relevant course-packet
material.)

Now to the 1859 Preface. Its concepts; its tone. How does it differ from _The
Communist Manifesto_ (if you have read it)? Prinz article, _Journal of the
History of Ideas_ , 1969: Article 20 of the Prussian Constitution: guaranteed
the freedom of science and of the teaching of science. Article 100 of the
Prussian Penal Code set an up to two-year prison term for inciting class
hatred, and authorized the confiscation of works inciting class hatred.

Read _MER_ , 700-17 (3rd part of Engels, _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_ ,
on the materialist conception of history); also go over "1859 Preface" again.

**3/Th, Sept 11/97**. Continued analysis of "1859 Preface," coupled with a
glance at Hegel's conception of the history of philosophy. Note that the
materialist conception of history appears to be a theory of _pre_ -history:
what are the implications of this fact? Set of social categories; theory of
change; metaphysic of history; expression of faith. Relation between
categories; issue of determinism (Megill should re-read Resch on Althusser's
view). Distinction between ontological, ethical, and historical senses of
"materialism." Marx, mathematics, and nonlinearity. (For interest's sake, see
Engels's amazing letter to Joseph Bloch, September 21-22, 1890, all but
demolishing "the materialist conception of history, excerpted in Marx and
Engels, _Basic Writings on Politics and Philosophy_ , ed Lewis S. Feuer
[HX39.5.A224 1959, reserve], pp. 397-400.) Some German terms:
_gesellschaftliche Bewusstseinsformen_ ; _ideologische Formen_ ; _juristischer
und politischer uberbau_; _Produktionsverh altnisse_; _materielle Produktivkr
afte_. Read: _MER_ , 694-70 (2nd part of Engels, _Socialism: Utopian and
Scientific_ , on German idealist philosophy); compare with _MER_ , 7-11 and
with _Collected Works_ , vol. 1, 10-21 (Nov. 10-11, 1837 letter from Marx to
his father), and 84-87 (part of 1841 doctoral dissertation). For interest's
sake: see Engels, _Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German
Philosophy_ , in Feuer anthology, 195-242. ****

**4/Tu, Sept 16/97**. Continued analysis of "1859 Preface." Some essentials
for talking about causation. Sufficient vs. necessary cause. Economic vs.
technological determinism. But hidden is the relation of determinism back to a
Hegelian conception of (logical- historical) necessity (for later: course-
packet material). See Descombes on Hegel's philosophical rationalism, _The
Barometer of Modern Reason_ , ca. 84. The Aristotelian analysis of causation.
Marx's metaphysic of history, leading us to Hegel and beyond. Ideology as
"appearing" more advanced than empirical relationships (GI, in _MER_ , 195).
Here or earlier: similarities and differences between Engels, in _MER_ ,
700-17, and Marx. In brief: in what specific ways does Engels's conception of
historical materialism differ from Marx's as articulated in the 1859 Preface?
Engels on freedom; the prehistory/history distinction. The "anarchy of
production" (709). Why can't one predict the market? For interest's sake: why
the market is unpredictable: Marx, _Poverty of Philosophy_ (1847), _CW_ , 6:
137. Read: _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_ , 1st part, _MER_ , 683-94, on
"utopian socialism."

**5/Th, Sept 18/97**. Continued analysis of "1859 Preface." Marx's theory of
change, metaphysic of history, statement of faith. "Idealist" implications--
history as a rational process. Transition back to Marx's earliest period.
Read: McLellan, _Karl Marx: His Life and Thought_ , chap. 1, soon [on
reserve]. Types of idealism and materialism, so you'll avoid confusion. What
is "ideology"? Economic vs. technological determinism. A more difficult issue:
What is "dialectic"? Maybe around this point we shall get into some of Megill,
"Marx and History," section 1; also Sciabarra, ca. pp. 3-4, although that may
be premature right here. Problems of "ought" and "is." Read: if not done
before, _Collected Works_ , vol. 1, 10-21 (1837 letter), 84-87 (dissertation
[see also _MER_ , 9-11]), 109-17 (censorship discussion of February, 1842
[premature?]).

**6/Tu, Sept 23/97**. Problems of freedom vs. determinism. 18th century
theology of nature (divine intention underpinning nature). David Hume; his
disturbing effect on Kant. Pierre Laplace's formula, envisaging a
deterministic universe. Rousseau and the general will; Kant's ethics. We can
think, here, as young Marx certainly did, of a conflict between "ideal" and
"real," freedom and determinism, that we can see German idealism as trying to
resolve. Hegel and Hegelianism. Marx and his friends: Progressive
intellectuals in a backward state. Hegelian version of "embedded rationality":
history and dialectic. Read (parts of) Megill, "Marx and History" draft,
section 1. Laplace's formula. Perhaps I might also mention something of Marx's
family background, although McLellan should serve as the main source for that.
READ: _Collected Works_ , vol. 1, 109-17 (censorship). Possibly read Ruge
letters: _EW_ , 199-206 (also, 3rd letter is in _MER_ , 12-15): What is Marx's
program, and why?

**7/Th, Sept 25/97**. Why Hegel's philosophy mattered to Marx and his friends,
and what they tried to get from it. "The real is the rational, and the
rational is the real." How this could be variously interpreted. See Engels,
_Ludwig Feuerbach and the End of Classical German Philosophy_ ," in Lewis
Feuer anthology (HX39.5.A224 1959), 198-99. Epimethean vs. Promethean view of
Hegel's philosophy. What did Marx get from Hegel (according to Engels?
according to your own reading of the very early Marx?). Discussions of
religion and theology in 1830s. (For "deep" background, there are good books
by John E. Toews [ _on reserve_ ] and Harold Mah.) The question: how is
freedom possible? Re-read Engels, _Socialism: Utopian and Scientific_ , part
2, _MER_ , 694-700 (on idealist philosophy); now definitely read _EW_ ,
199-206 (letters to Ruge, 1843); Toews, _Hegelianism_ (on reserve), 356-69 may
be useful, especially for review. _Possibly_ read _EW_ , 211-34, maybe also
235-41 ("On the Jewish Question," part 1); _Collected Works_ , 1, 211-14 (Marx
on Gruppe on Bauer).

**8/Tu, Sept 30/97**. Perhaps I'll develop Marx's distinction between
"prehistory" and "history," if I've not done so yet (see relevant passages in
_MER_ 160, 193, 717). More on religion and theology. Perhaps I'll use the
Heine quotes, which Toews employs as epigraphs to one of his chapters. The
role of religion in the German state (cf. Confino; cf. James J. Sheehan's
book). Marx's own attitude: his father's conversion; Lessing and the three
rings. Epicurus as a religious rationalist. The idea of a _critical_
philosophy; cf. Engels, later. David Friedrich Strauss. Bruno Bauer (need a
graduate student to write a dissertation on Bauer). ( _I may actually say less
about religion than I have done in earlier versions, because there is more
material along a "rationalism" line to be considered._ ) What is the _basic
point_ of "On the Jewish Question"? Humanism. Political emancipation vs. human
emancipation. Various ways of conceptualizing freedom. Read Avineri, 13-22
(the state in Hegel and Marx) and 31-38 (democracy in Marx). Read: _EW_ ,
235-41 ("On the Jewish Question," part 2). Also read _Collected Works_ ,
195-202 (July 14, 1842 article, on whether philosophers ought to discuss
religious matters in newspaper articles).

**9/Th, Oct 2/97**. "The real [actual] is the rational and the rational
[actual] is the real" needs glossing, if that's not been done already. For
Marx at this time: where is the revolutionary agent (in, e.g., Marx and
Engels, _Collected Works_ , 1: 195)? Reactions to "Jewish Question," part 2?
Bauer's take on Judaism, and his position generally: "the terrorism of true
theory." Bauer sees the "mass" as corrupting theory; Marx looks for a bearer
for his radical hopes. Marx as idealist and (incipient) materialist. On Marx
and _Judentum_." At some point I shall discuss the structure of the German
states, basically out of James Sheehan ( _German History, 1770-1866_ :
excellent book). Out of the letters to Ruge, what does it mean to "interest a
great party in practice"? Some discussion of the distinction between "estates
system" and "representative system." Read: (some of?) Feuerbach, _The Fiery
Brook_ , 54-55, 96-101, 128-31, 152-43, 176-77, 202-05, 224-27, 240-45 (or, we
may forego reading Feuerbach, and I'll read passages in class from _The
Essence of Christianity_ and other works). Read Avineri, 48-64, on bureaucracy
and proletariat. Read: Perhaps puzzle through some of _EW_ , 18-28, 84-90,
105-109, 112 of "Critique of Hegel's Doctrine of the State." Read also:
"Introduction to the Contribution to the Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of
Right," _EW_ , 243-57. _TQ_ : what's new in "Introduction"? Read: Avineri on
Hegel and Feuerbach, 8-31. [Reminder: the _actual_ reading will be what I
assign in class.]

**10/Tu, Oct 7/97**. Around this time or before, I should bring in David
Friedrich Strauss, _The Life of Jesus_ (1835-36), to indicate what his
argument was. Strauss timid; Bauer much less so--sees philosophy as having
superseded Christianity (and Judaism) (a good entry to Bauer is via _Collected
Works_ 1: 211-14). Bauer's _venia legendi_ was removed in early 1842; that was
the absolute kiss of death for Marx's academic hopes also--thus Marx's turn to
journalism (get French collection of Bauer's writings). Bauer a kind of
reductio ad absurdum of Hegelianism, against which Marx could eventually turn.
Discussion of "Introduction to the Contribution to the Critique . . . .": what
is your reaction to this work? What are the fundamental differences between
"Jewish Question" and "Introduction"? Hegel on the state. His conception of
bureaucracy. Feuerbachian critique of Hegel's conception of the state.
Universal class. Workers in Paris; Silesian hand-loom weavers. Tension between
descriptive and activist dimensions of Marx's project. Read: Avineri, 48-64,
on proletariat; maybe James Mill excerpts, _EW_ , 259-78; maybe "estranged
labor" section of EPM, _EW_ , 322-34, but certainly material leading up to it.

**11/Th, Oct 9/97**. On alienation and other matters. (Actually, I suspect
that we'll run a little slow: we may still be discussing "On the Jewish
Question" and "Introduction to the COntribution to the Critique of Hegel's
Philosophy of Right" at this date.) _In re_ "Introduction," what do you make
of _EW_ , 257, last sentence? Marx as radical is well represented in the
"Introduction": by what literary device, primarily? Silesian handloom weavers:
cf. Judith Coffin book: more complicated than the simple ousting of small-
scale hand production. READ: _Perhaps_ we shall start reading "Economic and
Philosophical Manuscripts," with a concentration on the "Estranged Labor"
section, _EW_ , 322-34 around now; perhaps compare with start of "James Mill"
excerpts. But this material may be premature for the moment. So: probably _EW_
, 322-34; also read Avineri, chapters 1 and 2, and selection on praxis,
124-34.

**READING HOLIDAY: SATURDAY, OCTOBER 11 THROUGH TUESDAY, OCTOBER 14, 1997.**

**MOST LIKELY MIDTERM TEST DATE: PERIOD 14, THURSDAY, OCTOBER 23, 1997.**

**12/Th, Oct 16/97**. Marx's "discovery" of the proletariat. The Franco-German
connection--Marx now in Paris. Perhaps go through some Feuerbach passages.
Engels: his origins and character, his contributions to Marx's development.
Adam Smith. How Marx's account differs from Engels's. Engels's moralizing and
logical critiques of the present order. Engels as clear writer, polemicist,
interested in portraying concrete specifics, not in digging deep. "Excerpts
from James Mill." Marx's reading in 1844 of Smith, Ricardo, and Say. The
excerpts actually _follow_ the EPM. Detailed discussion in Megill, "Marx and
History" draft, on "Marx and the market." Differences between Marx's and
Engels's critiques of political economy. Certainly by now read "estranged
labor" section, _EW_ , 322-34.

Engels and Feuerbach together guide Marx into political economy.

**13/Tu, Oct 21/97**. Perhaps, around this time, I should discuss _activity_
in Marx, which could be done via a discussion of Hegel, Fichte, and Feuerbach.
I MIGHT ALSO DISCUSS DIFFERENT CONCEPTIONS OF FREEDOM. Types of alienation.
Relation between alienation and private property. A problem here: why did Marx
want the aboliton of private property? I may introduce my business about "why
Marx hated the market" here, or I may defer that and concentrate on alienation
and on Marx's conception of human nature. READ: possibly _EW_ , 345-58 (on
communism). (Or: both "Private Property and Communism" and "Needs.").

**14/Th, Oct 23/97: Probable date for midterm test (50 minutes)**.

**15/Tu, Oct 28/97**. Actually, in the last teaching of the course it was only
in this session that we got to the "Estranged Labor" section in a serious way.
Marx's view of human nature in EPM. "Alienation" in broader perspective,
before and after Marx. Ambiguities in Marx's exposition. Some criticisms of
Marx's position. Habermas on reduction of human interaction to labor. If the
real problem is estranged labor, why worry about private property and the
market at all? Read, EPM, _EW_ , 358-79 (need, production, and division of
labor). Further discussion of alienation, communism, and related notions.
Marx's internal (but deeply analytic) critique of political economy. Adam
Smith's three factors of production. An unresolved issue in EPM: the issue of
history. Also read "Excerpts from James Mill," especially the beginning and
the end. Possibly read "Critique of Hegel's Dialectic," _EW_ , 379-400.
Perhaps also Berki article, _Political Theory_ , 1979.

**Note that the "RETRICTED TERM PAPERS" are _rigidly_ due on MONDAY, DECEMBER
1, 1997, by midnight (practically, that means by 9 am the next morning).**
Monday, December 1 is the first day back from the Thanksgiving Recess.

**16/Th, Oct 30/97**. In the previous two versions of this course the range of
material presented by this point in the semester was so extensive that it is
quite hard to see how it can be fitted into this one version. Some highlights
gleaned from several lectures: (1) An account of the two different critiques
of political economy in "Excerpts from James Mill," at the beginning, _EW_ ,
259-60. A discussion of unpredictability (or see "Marx and History").
"Chance": _EW_ , 283, 287. (2) discussion of "activity" in Fichte and others,
with link to praxis. (3) Crucial passages in Feuerbach, relating to activity,
love, community (quoting from _The Fiery Brook_ ). (4) The four aspects of
estrangement [or alienation] in "Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts," and
how they are related. (The notion of activity, and the question of how,
causally, the four aspects of estrangement are related, are connected, I
contend.) READ: _EW_ , to 358 (end of the "types of communism" discussion).

**17/Tu, Nov 4/97**. Again: various topics related to the EPM. P. 359: notion
of the "wealth of human needs." Three forms of communism. P. 353: the
transformation of the senses. "Nature 1" and "Nature 2." "Geist" enters into
the constitution of Nature 2. Proudhon's objective focus vs. Fourier's
subjective focus: and the synthesis in Marx )ca. 345). Marx's "unitarism."
(ca. 349, 357). In short, there are many richly suggestive passages. P. 357:
on world history, the primacy of labor, different conceptions of labor in Marx
(Berki); vs. Habermas's neo- Marxian critique of the primacy of labor in Marx
(Habermas wants to have three elements, language or symbolic representation,
interaction, and labor, resisting what he sees as Marx's reduction of
everything to labor (but he may be inaccurate about Marx, at least to some
degree--see 365, 379). ( **Habermas will be speaking at UVa this semester.** )
Relation between theory and practice in Marx. Aristotle on theory and
practice. Hegel's position: integrates history into his account of knowledge,
unlike Aristotle. Marx then reinterprets Hegel's "Geist" as "abstract mental
labor" ( _EW_ , 386). Further, there is a great stress on _activity_ in the
"Critique of Hegel's Dialectic": a "Fichteanizing" of Hegel? In any case, Marx
clearly stresses the _active_ subject. And he sees philosophy as below the
level of natural science _EW_ , 356). Read: EPM, in _EW_ , more carefully:
_now_ , definitely, read "Critique of Hegel's Dialectic." __

**18/Th, Nov 6/97**. Marx's double attitude toward need ( _Bed urfnis_), both
positive and negative. An aesthetic dimension in Marx's view of human life.
How does Marx link individual and society? Also, some passages scattered
through EPM may be worth discussion together--passages where Marx suggests
things that _don't_ seem reducible to labor. Through the concept of need.
Critique of Hegel's Dialectic: negativity, self-creation, objectification--all
require discussion. Where did Hegel go wrong, according to Marx? Read: _EW_ ,
421-23 ("On Feuerbach"); perhaps start into _The German Ideology_ , _MER_ ,
146 ff.

**19/Tu, Nov 11/97**. How "On Feuerbach" (or "Theses on Feuerbach") and _The
German Ideology_ respond to questions raised but not answered in the Economic
and Philosophical Manuscripts. Marx's orientation to "hitherto existing
materialism." How does he depart from Feuerbach, and with what justifications?
Marx's view of science. Marx uses Feuerbach to critique Hegel, then uses Hegel
to critique Feuerbach. (We can to some extent use "The German Ideology" to
fill in gaps in the "1859 Preface.") Read: Finish _The German Ideology_.
**Handout listing crucial passages of _Capital_.**

**20/Th, Nov 13/97**. What can one make of this passage: "consciousness can
sometimes appear further advanced than the contemporary aempirical
relationships, so that in the struggles of a later epoch one can refer to
earlier theoreticians as authorities" ( _MER_ , 195). Also, there are some
other crucial passages--most importantly on p. 160, but other passages as
well. On the division of labor: division of labor vs. no division of labor,
natural vs. voluntary division of labor, and old (structural) vs. new
(personal) division of labor. Three conceptions of labor in Marx: general and
neutral; negative; positive. Various matters involved in Marx's transitions
1843-45. The political dimension. Does Marx overreach himself? Does he not
assume that there is _one right view_? Why not two _contradictory_ "right
views"? Moreover, Marx's concern with praxis naturally drives him to seek a
single view. READ: _MER_ , 236-46, 439-40 (Grundrisse).

**21/Tu, Nov 18/97**. Stages in Marx's consideration of economics. Althusser's
argument for an "epistemological break." "Theses on Feuerbach," again. On the
notion of the abolition of labor. _Grundrisse_ , one-page handout. _MER_ ,
441, also 290, also 240-41--Marx's somewhat conflicting views on "labor":
abolish it; reduce it to a minimum; or make it deeply enjoyable. Read: From
now on in, the main reading will be selections from _Capital_ , vol. 1 (I
shall hand out a list of what we shall be reading from the work). We shall
also look at pieces from _Wage-Labor and Capital_ and from the so-called
_Grundri¡ìe_ (see _MER_ , 236-44 and 244-487). Also look at _MER_ , 441 (realm
of necessity v. realm of freedom). [I SHALL NO LONGER LIST READING ON THIS
SCHEDULE: from here on in .]

**22/Th, Nov 20/97**. The method of _Capital_ : Marx's essentialism. Hegel's
_Logic_. We shall consider carefully a couple of _Grundrisse_ passages. Holism
vs. methodological individualism in Marx's view of social reality. Relation to
holism to Marx's conception of revolutionary change (Shiell article, on
reserve). The "fetishism of commodities." Around this time, I shall begin
discussing the actual economic argument of _Capital_. Use value/exchange
value/Value distinction.

**23/Tu, Nov 25/97**. Possibly this session I shall simply go through some
crucial passages in _Capital_ (listed in the _Capital_ reading handout), to
give people an idea of the overall shape of the work (since the "restricted
term paper" is due next week). A crucial initial issue: what is the "fetishism
of commodities"? Marx's eesentialism. Labor theory of value. Surplus value.
Marx as scientist v. Marx as revolutionary. Marx's conception of labor, as
indicated in various texts from 1844 through _Capital_ (some _topoi_ ,
including one suggested by Berki).

THANKSGIVING RECESS: THURSDAY NOV 28 THROUGH SUNDAY NOV 30.

**"RESTRICTED TERM PAPER" DUE ON MONDAY, DECEMBER 1, BY MIDNIGHT (PRACTICALLY,
THAT MEANS BY 9 AM NEXT MORNING).**

**24/Tu, Dec 2/97**. The optimistic Marx v. the disabused Marx. How _Capital_
differs from _Wage-Labor and Capital_. The labor/labor-power distinction, et
al. Or, more likely, a discussion of economies of scale, and of individualism
vs. holism in his view of capitalism. Perhaps, too, his conception of
alienation could be contrasted with the Heideggerian and Sartrean views--in
the latter instances, the world is not assumed to be rational, that is, there
is a rejection of even covert assumptions of some sort of rational
intentionality underpinning the world. This makes a difference.

**25/Th, Dec 4/97**. Diseconomies of scale--linked to some "chaos theory"
arguments (which Marx would find strange). On the unpredictable character of
innovation. Helps explain his hostility not only to the market, but also to
politics. Read Avineri, 117-23 and 174-84, on "fetishism of commodities" and
on the "dialectics of change" in capitalist society (now, if not earlier).
Three conceptions of history in Marx. Why we shouldn't expect to find a
consistency in _Capital_.

**26/Tu, Dec 9/97**. More on _Capital_.

**27/Th, Dec 11/97**. More on _Capital_. Conclusion

CLASSES END DECEMBER 12.

**FINAL EXAM** : MONDAY, DECEMBER 15, 9 AM TO 12 NOON.

### Course Subject and Rationale:

 **** The course carefully surveys the thought of Karl Marx (1818- 1883), and
in lesser degree makes links to subsequent social and political theory. The
topic is significant from a number of different perspectives. Marx was one of
the most important social thinkers of the nineteenth century, and study of his
major works casts light on modern European intellectual and social history
generally. He is an important philosopher, and the course may be of interest
to philosophy majors and others who wish to study in detail how one original
and sophisticated mind worked. Thirdly, since much in twentieth-century
history from 1917 to 1991 was done in Marx's name, there is some interest in
seeing what he actually said. Finally, some Marxian concepts are still
relevant to historians', sociologists', and political scientists'
understanding of society. The course focuses on what Marx said, what he meant
in saying it, and why he meant it as he did. We shall also devote some
attention to the question of the coherence and validity of the theory, always
keeping in mind a crucial question: how was it possible that a theory
articulated in the interests of freedom came to serve as a justification for
unfreedom? There will be heavy emphasis on how Marx's position emerged from
assumptions that were widely held by nineteenth-century intellectuals--
although Marx's working out of those assumptions was more rigorous than was
the case with almost any of his contemporaries.

By the end of the semester, you will know Marx with considerable thoroughness.
Emphasis will be on the writings of Marx himself (and on some of Engels's
writings) rather than on the more recent history of Marxism. Nonetheless, I
shall refer to subsequent theoretical developments where these seem
particularly relevant to understanding Marx. I have been working actively on
Marx lately (resuming work set aside several years ago), and so students can
expect to learn some things that are not at all generally known. Marx was not
always a Marxist (some would say that he never was), and we shall devote a lot
of time to the emergence of the theory. Accordingly, we shall look very
carefully at the early writings, especially those of 1843-45, devoting more
than half the semester to them. In the final third or so of the semester, we
shall pay serious attention to _Capital_ , vol. 1. We shall pay much less
attention to Marx's more tactical and occasional writings. Students read the
texts, which are then explicated and discussed in class. The readings are
often short, but almost always difficult. That is why they need explication.

I last taught the course in 1992 and 1993. I do not anticipate teaching it
again for _at least_ three semesters.

### Course Requirements:

(1) In order to give a focus to the reading and to encourage you to keep up, I
assign "think" questions based on the reading and requiring informal answers
in a short paragraph. There will be 8-10 of these over the course of the
semester. They will be marked on a pass-fail basis (however, I do take note of
"think" questions that are especially good). _**It is absolutely crucial that
the reading be done on time, so that you read it before I explicate it in
class.**_ If you do the reading only after I have discussed it, you will never
know the truth _for yourself_ , and it will show.

(2) There will be a midterm test, 50 minutes long, almost certainly to be
given on Thursday, October 20, 1997. Consider it as counting for about 20% of
the grade; but see (5) below.

(3) In this type of course, which introduces you to sophisticated new
material, I have found that for the vast majority of undergraduates a
traditional term paper is not a good idea. Instead of such a paper, students
will be required to make up, toward the end of the semester, a "restricted
term paper" for the course, formulating and answering, in not more than six
single-spaced typewritten pages, a question or questions chosen by you with an
eye to demonstrating your understanding of the material as a whole. I shall
mark the "restricted term paper" on a letter-grade basis. To allow for their
marking and return before the end of classes (so that you can benefit from
them in studying for the exam), **the due date is Monday, December 1, by
midnight** (that is, the day classes resume after Thanksgiving Recess). For
reasons of fairness, this is a _rigid_ deadline, and exceptions will be
granted only under the most unusual circumstances. Also, _students are
expected to retain a copy of their paper, and of their working notes and
drafts, until after the end of the semester_.

**Note** : A few students with prior background may prefer to write a more
standard, research-oriented term paper, perhaps focusing on problems in the
interpretation of some of Marx's less prominent writings (the more prominent
writings have been commented on almost to death, and I doubt that I would
learn much from term papers on them). If anyone is interested, discuss the
possibility with me early in the semester. Rightly, very few students opt to
do a research-oriented paper; most find the "sample exam" exercise invaluable
in helping them to integrate the course material. (4) There will be a final
exam, of the traditional three-hour closed- book type. It will be held on
**Monday, December 15, from 9 am to noon.** __ (5) Note that the "restricted
term paper" and the final exam count about equally for the final grade. The
midterm test may marginally influence the grade when there is some doubt in my
mind as to what, exactly, it should be. The number and quality of the "think
questions" also has some marginal influence on the grade. _

**_Graduate Students:** Graduate students are welcome to sit in on the class,
but they are generally not supposed to say anything during the class period.
Quite often graduate students audit the class, while pursuing some well
defined term paper project under another number.

Professor Brosnan joined the University of Tennessee Department of History in
August 1999. Her research focuses on the intersection of environmental, urban
and legal history in the western United States. Dr. Brosnan completed her
Ph.D. with honors in 1999 at the University of Chicago, where she was the Von
Holst Prize Lecturer in History and a Lecturer in Environmental Studies. Her
book, _Uniting Mountain and Plain: Urbanization, Law and Environmental Change_
, will be published by the University of New Mexico Press. She has published
articles on the Illinois & Michigan Canal and curriculum materials on the
American Frontier. Dr. Brosnan has presented papers at the meetings of the
American Historical Association, the Organization of American Historians, the
Western History Association, and the American Society for Environmental
History and participated in numerous seminars and symposia on environmental
and urban history.

Professor Brosnan's new research project focuses on the culture of California
wine and its impact on land, law, labor, and education.

In addition to the U.S. History survey, Professor Brosnan teaches The
Environment in U.S. History, Environmental History of Urban America, The
American West, and the United States, 1877-1933. Her graduate seminars in
environmental history adopt a bioregional approach. During graduate school,

Michigan Canal Corridor National Historic Landmark Project for the National
Park Service and on exhibits for the Newberry Library and the American Library
Association.

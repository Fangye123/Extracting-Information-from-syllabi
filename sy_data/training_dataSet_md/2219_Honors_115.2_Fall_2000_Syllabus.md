**Description:** Welcome to Western Experience II.   Since this is an Honors
course, we're going to approach world literature a little differently than
some classes:  we're going to concentrate on literature of the twentieth
century.  Much of the history of the western world is the history of empires
and colonies (the United States can be included, of course), and the twentieth
century saw massive changes in the ways people viewed imperialism.  We'll
focus, then, on how the experiences of colonization and decolonization have
affected writing and thinking in the last one hundred years.  We'll also
examine each piece with an eye for the following additional themes:  the
creation of the self and its relationship with society as well as the
alienation of the self in society; the definitions and roles of the hero; the
concept of the journey; and various others as they emerge.

This class will require a great deal of reading, writing, and participation,
but I hope that you won't be intimidated:  I've attempted to find readings
that are thought-provoking and, I hope, enjoyable.  Do not expect to be a
passive member of the class.  You'll read for almost every class, and
frequently you will have to write about that reading.  I expect you to do the
reading, write about it some of the time, and participate in--and even lead--
class.  In addition, you will have two brief essays (3-5 pages each).  You may
seek my help or the Writing Center's help (see below) at any time.  Two
quizzes will also be given:  one at midterm and one during finals week.

**Responses:** You will write ten one-page responses for readings of your
choice; in each response, you must analyze the reading and discuss a
meaningful aspect of the reading (theme, character, symbolism, etc.).   I do
NOT want you to summarize the reading.  Short responses must be one page each,
typed or LEGIBLY handwritten.  Since you're selecting the readings to which
you will respond, in effect, you're creating your own due dates.  Two caveats,
though:  (1) Each response is due BEFORE we discuss that particular reading
(late responses will NOT be accepted), and (2) you'll need to pace yourself
and plan ahead.  Early work will be accepted.  Responses will be graded on a
check system based on both the quality of response and meeting the length
requirement.

**Oral Reports:  ** You'll sign up for topics early in the first week of
classes.  Don't forget to mark your choice on your copy of the schedule of
events.  Please see me at least a week before your report to determine the
scope of your project.  You may see me as often as you would like for
guidance.  This report is a research project in which you present helpful
background information to the class, and you should have a minimum of two
sources.  You may use any introductions found in our class texts, but do NOT
rely on them.   Each report must be ten to fifteen minutes in length.  You may
bring in audiovisual aids (clips, pictures, etc.), but they may not replace
more than 25% of your minimum speaking time.  Let me know early if you need
audiovisual equipment.  The reports will be graded on a combination of
quality, based on the report's usefulness and relevance to the class, and
meeting the minimum requirements in research and length.

**Leading Class Discussion:**   During the first week, you'll also sign up for
a day of leading discussion.  Don't forget to mark your day on your schedule
of events.  As with the oral report, please see me at least a week in advance
to discuss your plans.  I'll be happy to offer direction as often as needed
before your discussion day.  When you lead class, you will be responsible for
bringing up issues and asking questions for the entire class period.  I'll
jump into the discussion only as necessary.  Grades will be based on the
quality of the questions posed and the organization of the issues.  If your
efforts spark a good discussion that day, your grade will benefit accordingly.

**Essays:  ** More information on the essay requirements will be distributed
in the upcoming weeks.  Please note that late papers will be penalized one
letter grade per class day late.

**Participation:** Class participation will affect your grade in the following
way:   If you offer meaningful, constructive participation often in class,
your grade may rise by one mark (e.g., B+ to A-); if you contribute to the
class sometimes, no change will be made; if you participate rarely, not at
all, or if you ask questions that could, for example, be answered by the
nearest dictionary, your grade may drop by a mark (e.g. A- to B+).

**![](screechunblocked.gif)Writing Center:**   The wonderful service that the
Writing Center provides is free.  It's there for any writer, no matter your
skill level:  ANY writer can become a better writer.  You may take in any
writing for the class (except quizzes) for the benefit of having another
reader provide you with feedback.  You may also use our Online Writing Lab to
send your papers to the consultants--from the comfort of your own home or dorm
room!  The Writing Center is located in FDH 240 (phone 895-3908).  I will look
MOST FAVORABLY on visits to the Writing Center.  (I consider visits to be a
form of participation.)

**Disability Resource Center:**   If you have a documented disability that may
require assistance, you will need to contact the Disability Resource Center
for coordination in your academic accommodations.  The DRC is located in the
Reynold Student Services Complex, room 137, phone 895-0866 (TDD 895-0652)

**Attendance:**   Be punctual.  You must attend class to hand in responses and
to participate.  For absences due to...

![](bulletcompass.gif) | Religious holidays, see the Fall 2000 Class Schedule
for procedures.  
---|---  
![](bulletcompass.gif) | University-sanctioned events, have your coach or
activity advisor write a note on university letterhead listing the date(s) you
will miss.  
![](bulletcompass.gif) | Medical reasons, bring an excuse written by a doctor
on his or her office stationery.  
  
**Ethics and Plagiarism:**   You must do your own original work in this class.
If you use others' ideas, words, phrasing, and so on (whether on paper or from
the Internet), you must document your use.  Failure to do so is plagiarism, a
form of stealing.  If you plagiarize, you will receive an F for the assignment
and possibly for the course as well.  If you have any questions about whether
or not to cite something, just ASK ME.

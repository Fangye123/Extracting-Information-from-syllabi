**Course Goals and Purpose**  
  
The focus of this course is the scientific and anthropological study of the
origins, evolution and biological adaptations of humans. We will be using
numerous lines of evidence to put together a coherent conception of human
evolutionary biology. First, we will examine the mechanics and the process of
evolution and study living nonhuman primates to see how they inform various
understandings of ourselves. Then we will examine the human fossil record,
learning about the actual beings that may have proceeded our species, _Homo
sapiens sapiens_. Using prehistoric archaeology and studies of human
adaptation to diverse environments, we'll explore the current diversity of our
species. Throughout the course we will engage each other in discussion of
issues such as evolution versus creationism, public perceptions of
evolutionary theory, and the nature of scientific investigation and theory-
building.  
  
**Administrative Details**  
  
**Course Web Page**  
[ http://www.unc.edu/~akakalio/anth43](http://www.unc.edu/~akakalio/anth43)  
  
**Required Text**  
Boyd, Robert and Joan B. Silk, 1999. _How Humans Evolved_ , 2nd Edition.
Norton.  
  
**Other Readings**  
Various brief readings on the World Wide Web will be assigned throughout the
semester - to be announced.  
  
_Readings should be completed before the day they are to be discussed._  
  
**Course Requirements**  
One's grade in a class shouldn't be determined by tests alone. Thus, there are
a number of ways you can do well in this course...  
  
**Attendance and Participation - 5%**  
Attendance in class (and discussion) is a fundamental requirement for success.
Questions are always welcome and encouraged. You can earn an easy 5% of your
grade by asking questions, coming to office hours and stimulating class
discussion.  
  
**Online Forum Discussion - 20%**  
During the semester it will behoove you to visit the web page often. One of
the features of the page is a discussion forum. There are two main topics for
discussion - Creationism vs. Evolution, and General Announcements, information
and questions. You are required to post _at least_ once on each of these
discussion boards. If you go to the main home page at
<http://www.unc.edu/~akakalio/anth43/index2.html> and click on the "Discussion
Forums" picture (lower left), you will find the discussion forums. The first
posts will be by me and will outline the ground rules for the discussions.  
  
**Research Paper - 25%**  
You will be required to write a research paper on a topic or controversy in
human evolution and/or human adaptability. I'll provide a list of topics and
library journal and text resources for you. The paper should be 5 to 7 pages
long, and there will three due dates - one for the topic/outline, another for
a rough draft and one for the final copy (see the table below). A more
detailed list of guidelines for the paper will be handed out in class.  
  
**Exams - 50%**  
Two non-cumulative midterm examinations will be held after each section of the
course. A **non-cumulative** final exam is scheduled for May 11 at 8:00am.
Make-ups will be granted for appropriate emergency medical or family excuses.
Any other excuse (I missed the bus!) is not acceptable. Exams will be
primarily objective - multiple choice, matching, and true/false - so come
prepared with a scantron exam sheet and a no. 2 pencil. Make-up tests will be
more challenging than their in-class counterparts, so make every effort to
take the test on the designated date.  
  
Each "midterm" exam will be worth 15% of your final grade, with the final exam
counts for 20% your final grade.  
  
**Extra Credit**  
There will be various opportunities to pull in some extra credit throughout
the semester. If you want to go the extra mile, you should have every
opportunity to do so. See [The Extra Credit Page](xcredit.html) for details.

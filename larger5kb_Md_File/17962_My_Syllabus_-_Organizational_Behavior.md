| **CLASS ACTIVITIES**  
---  
|  This course is experiential.  Case analyses, role-plays, and other
involvement exercises will be used to demonstrate concepts presented in the
text and lectures.  Much of the class time will be devoted to these activities
in place of lectures. We will use breakout rooms on the first and second
floors for group activities.  
  
  
**TEAM PROJECTS**  
---  
|  During the second class meeting, teams of five to six people will be formed
that will last throughout the quarter.  The teams will work on minor and major
projects in the following sequence:  
  
  
**Team Project #1 - Case Analysis Report**  
---  
|  This is a case analysis paper worth 20% of the course grade.  It is due at
the beginning of class on 10/12/00.  
  
Teams will analyze a case (to be assigned) and will develop a case report that
is maximum 6 pages long, double-spaced, typed.  The report should address the
most important issues and offer expert advice concerning improvements.  
  
In drafting the report, follow your "group success" guidelines, along with the
case analysis methodology provided by the instructor.  These will be covered
in detail during class.  
  
Criteria used to judge/grade Project #1 reports include:  
  
a.  Organization, flow, clarity 30%  
b.  Quality of case analysis 30%  
c.  Quality of recommendations 30%  
d.  Appearance of the finished report 10%  
    (typing, attention to detail, etc.)   
  
  
  
**Team Project #2**  
---  
|  Your task is to create an organization development program for a specific
organization assigned by the instructor.  The product is worth 20% of the
course grade, and is due 11/9/00 in class.  
  
Project #2 requires all team members to become knowledgeable about the field
of organization development (OD) and also knowledgeable about OD methods and
interventions.  While this topic is covered in class and in the textbook,
significant outside investigation of OD is required, Workforce 2020 should be
strongly considered.  Some materials are on reserve in the library under BUS
387-06, Battersby; other resources will be identified in class.  The team will
then write a paper on the assigned organization, containing:  
  
1\. A summary diagnosis of the state of the company.  
2\. An ideal stepwise O.D. problem with several (6-8) interventions linked
together and described in detail.  
3\. A section covering possible barriers.  
4\. Integration of Workforce 2020 predictions and practices.  
5\. Forecasting and using your creativity reengineer the company as you would
see it in 2015.  
6\. Conclusion - brief: The project #2 product is to be a maximum of 15
typewritten double-spaced pages, not including exhibits and appendices.  
  
Grading Criteria  
  
a. Organizational flow and clarity 10%  
b. Use of course theory, O.D. concepts, 2020 & performance material 10%  
c. Quality of O.D. program 10%  
d. Conclusions and relearnings 20%  
e. Video Presentation* 50%  
  
*Each team will put together a 10-12 minute video (socio drama) based on the results of projects 1 and 2.  The video will be filmed in a studio setting in Building 2.  It must be well rehearsed as there will be no retakes or editing.  Tentative date is November 28.  Prof. Battersby will announce more details.   
  
  
  
**INDIVIDUAL TERM PAPER - TEAM EFFECTIVENESS**  
---  
|  Each student will write a short paper on team effectiveness theory and its
application to the two team projects.  The paper will be based on student
observations of team activities (a journal of observations is required) and
diverse ratings of team effectiveness completed during the course. Papers are
limited to four pages (not including attachments such as a journal).  Papers
are due November 30, 2000.  The term paper is a substitute for the final exam
and is worth 10% of the course grade.  
  
Criteria for grading individual papers:  
  
Organization, flow, clarity 30%  
Use of course theory 30%  
Back-up data (journal, ratings) 20%  
Conclusions, learning's 20%

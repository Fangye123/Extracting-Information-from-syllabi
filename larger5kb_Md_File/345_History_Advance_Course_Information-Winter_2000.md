The following is an old syllabus for the course. There will be some modest
changes for Winter, 2000, but the essential character of the course and its
requirements will be as set forth in this syllabus.

This course is intended to provide an introductory overview of Roman history
from 753 BCE, the legendary date of the city's founding, to 476 CE, the date
traditionally marking the collapse of central administration in the western
Roman Empire. The course will focus on social and cultural history, but will
also provide exposure to other aspects of ancient history and associated
methodologies such as archaeology and art history. While material remains such
as architectural ruins, works of art, and inscriptions are invaluable, their
interpretation depends heavily on literary works, which remain our principle
sources for understanding virtually all aspects of Classical antiquity.
Consequently, course readings will focus on ancient literary works in
translation.

TAs for Winter, 2000 will be Helmut Langerbein and Philip Whalen.

Section times and places will be announced in the Schedule and Directory.

_Course Requirements  
_ 1) You will be expected to attend lectures (3 per week) and discussion
meetings (1 per week) regularly. If you don't think that you're likely to be
comfortable with this requirement, _do not take this course_.

2) You will be required to take daily quizzes beginning with the fourth class
meeting. These quizzes will be based on the previous class lecture and on the
reading assigned for that day in the syllabus. Each quiz will consist of four
questions of which you will be expected to answer two. Each of the two answers
will be scored on a scale of 0 to 2. _You will have to_ ** _average_** _a
score of 4 on each quiz to pass the course_. You get two free misses.
Otherwise a missed quiz will be graded as zero. There will be no make-up
quizzes in the case of missed classes, unless you make an arrangement with me
_before_ the date of the original exam that you expect to miss or in the case
of a family emergency or a formal medical excuse.

3) You will be required to write three five-page papers based on assigned
readings discussed in discussion meetings. These papers will be due most
likely during the 3rd, 7th, and 10th weeks of the course; the exact day will
depend on what section you attend.

4) In order to pass the course, you will have to do passing work on _each_ of
its requirements: i.e., each of your three papers and your over-all quiz score
must all be passing.

**Note: Papers are due at the beginning of class on the dates assigned. They
will be accepted as late papers up to 24 hours later. Thereafter they will not
be accepted and you will automatically be assigned a No Pass for the course,
except in the case of a family emergency or of a formal medical excuse.**

Office: 33 Merrill  
Phone: 459-2927



### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is designed for freshman and sophomores. It offers an introductory
survey of the history of what would eventually become the United States of
America. It covers the years stretching from the beginning of the seventeenth
century through the end of the Civil War era (usually identified with the year
1877). Juniors and seniors may well find such a course insufficiently
intensive and demanding.



### ASSIGNED TEXTS (Tentative list)

Paul S. Boyer and others, **THE ENDURING VISION: A HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE** (Houghton Mifflin), vol. I.

Benjamin Franklin, **THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY AND OTHER WRITINGS** (Signet).

Theda Purdue and Michael D. Green, **THE CHEROKEE REMOVAL** (Bedford/St.
Martin's)

Henry Louis Gates, ed., **THE CLASSIC SLAVE NARRATIVES** (Mentor/Penguin).
This quarter, we will read Linda Brent is AIncidents in the Life of A Slave
Girl,@ which is included in this collection.



### COURSE REQUIREMENTS

All students are expected to attend all lectures, all discussion section
meetings, and to be up-to-date on all reading assignments. Attendance will be
taken in both lecture and discussion sections. Any student missing more than
three lectures or three discussion section meetings will automatically be
dropped from the course. Participation (and not merely attendance) in
discussion section is expected of all students. There will be two full-length
exams -- a midterm and a final. The mid-term exam will cover the first five
weeks of the course. The final exam will cover the course as a whole. Both
exams will be take-home exams.



### LECTURE & READING SCHEDULE

Below are listed the lecture themes for each week. Lectures will rarely be
neatly paired with readings and will often cover material not included in the
text. But familiarity with the text will make the lectures far easier to
understand and will be essential to passing the exams.

**WEEK ONE:** THE OLD WORLD AND THE NEW

**WEEK TWO:** THE COLONIAL SOUTH

**WEEK THREE:** THE COLONIAL NORTH

**WEEK FOUR:** THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION

**WEEK FIVE:** THE NEW REPUBLIC, 1789-1815

**WEEK SIX:** THE ANTEBELLUM SOUTH: KING COTTON  & HIS SUBJECTS

**WEEK SEVEN:** THE ANTEBELLUM NORTH: FREE-LABOR SOCIETY

**WEEK NINE:** POLITICAL STRUGGLES, 1800-1860: DEMOCRACY, ECONOMY, AND SLAVERY

History 196G:  
THE CIVIL WAR ERA , 1820-1877:  
SELECTED THEMES AND PROBLEMS

Professor: Bruce Levine

E-mail: [blevine@cats.ucsc.edu](mailto:blevine@cats.ucsc.edu)  
Office: 33 Merrill  
Phone: 459-2927

### DESCRIPTION:

The Civil War, broadly conceived, is generally acknowledged to be the most
important turning point in U.S. history. During the last thirty years, the
output of scholarly writing on the Civil War era (from the origins of the
sectional conflict through the end of Reconstruction) and its multiple facets
and implications has been enormous. New questions arise and controversies
proliferate steadily. This colloquium will aim at a critical, in-depth look at
selected topics in the historiography of this pivotal era.

The structure and content of this course assumes a familiarity with the basic
chronology and themes of the Civil War era. Previous enrollment in one of the
following courses is a necessary pre-requisite: The Origins of the Civil War
(History 180), The Civil War & Reconstruction (History 181), or The Second
American Revolution (History 22).



### ASSIGNMENTS

Students are expected to attend and actively participate in each week's
discussion of readings. Over the course of the quarter, each student will
write five brief essays (i.e., one every other week). Each essay will be
approximately five pages in length and will discuss issues raised in the
week=s reading assignments. The purpose of the essay is not so much to
demonstrate your mastery of the historians= opinions. Rather, you are asked to
summarize and evaluate those opinions in order, in the process, to clarify and
sharpen your own views about the issues in dispute.

Course evaluations will place approximately equal weight on seminar papers and
verbal contributions to seminar discussions.



### Weekly Reading & Discussion

_In the past, weekly reading & discussion topics in this course have
included:_

The Nature of Slavery and Relations between Masters and Slaves

Relations between Large Planters and Other Southern Whites

The Antislavery Movement in the North

The Role of Gender in the Politics of the Civil War Era

The Civil War as a Spur to the Development of American Capitalism

The Origins of the Republican Party

Southern Secession from the Union and the Northern Response

Why the North Won, Why the South Lost

How Slavery Was Destroyed

What Came after Slavery and Why?

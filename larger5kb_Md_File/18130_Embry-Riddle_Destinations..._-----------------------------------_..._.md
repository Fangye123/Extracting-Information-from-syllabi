**Academic Honesty:**

Embry-Riddle policies are in effect. Academic honesty is required of all

grades or expelled from the University.  
  
Plagiarism -- the appropriation of imitation of the language or ideas of
another person and presenting them as one's original work -- sometimes occurs
through carelessness or ignorance. If you are uncertain about proper
documentation of sources, please e-mail me. If you quote or paraphrase someone
else's work you must give the source credit through a footnote. Ignorance is
no excuse.

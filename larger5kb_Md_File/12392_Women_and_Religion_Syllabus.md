How This Course Works

This course will analyze women's relationship to religious ideologies,
spiritualities, and institutions from the early colonial period to the
present. Because you will need time to find a topic, complete the research,
and write a lengthy paper, we will not have time to explore every issue
concerning women and religion in American history. Instead we will concentrate
on a few themes and examine the ways in which women of different faith
traditions have dealt with these concerns. The themes include women,
witchcraft, and witch-hunting; women, reform, and politics; women and
ordination, evangelicalism, feminism, and sexuality. While the history of
institutional change will be considered, emphasis will be placed especially on
the history and practice of lived religion, as well as on the meaning of
religious identity and culture for women in the past and in today's world.

You will have the opportunity to explore further any of the topics we discuss
in class or any issue that has not been included here. If you're interested in
a specific faith tradition, you might want to see how that institution has
struggled with a particular problem. If instead you are interested in a
individual group of religious women (progressive nuns or utopian religious
women), then you are free to explore their history. It is up to you, as long
as you pursue a historical topic (anything before 1980) in America. In the
past students have looked at Catholic attitudes towards sex education in the
1950s, female responses towards Mormon polygamy in the 19th century, and
Reform Judaism's ordination of women rabbis in the early twentieth century,
just to name a few examples.

Course Requirements

Each student will formulate an individual research project, which examines in
depth a particular topic concerning women and religion in American history.
Students will write an original essay, based on research in primary sources
(approximately 20-25 pages). You are required to submit a typed preliminary
description of your project, outline, and bibliography on the assigned dates.
These all "count" in the final assessment of your grade. Drafts of essays will
be circulated and critiqued collectively by the other members of the seminar,
allowing time for revision before final submission at the end of the course.
We will meet in small groups to critique the papers; I will formulate the
groups based on shared interests. Evaluation will be based on all of the work
of the seminar--the quality of discussion and paper critiques as well as the
final essay, though the paper will count most heavily (approximately 75%).
Students will be responsible as well for preparing an outline of major
questions and issues for one week's readings to help facilitate class
discussion.

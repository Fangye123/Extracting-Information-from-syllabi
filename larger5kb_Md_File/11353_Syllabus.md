Course Description:

We will examine metropolitan growth and development in large cities that have
risen rapidly in the twentieth century.  We will compare the physical,
economic, political, and social circumstances that account for variations and
similarities in metropolitan form.

Our primary examples will be drawn from all comers of the globe:  in the
United States, we will consider Denver;  in Canada, we will look at Toronto;
in Australia, we will examine Melbourne;  and in South America, we will
explore Brasilia.  In addition, there will be single-lecture presentations
about other cities in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

_Course Requirements_ (and % of grade assigned to each):  
  
1) Writing Assignments, 4-5 pages each (10% each, 30% total)  
       a) Choose any large city in the world (population over 1 million and outside of the United States).  It should not be one of the cities covered in class lectures.  Summarize how it has changed over the course of the twentieth century.  Include basic demographic information (at the very least, population figures from 1900, 1950, and 1990 or 2000), and describe important political, economic, physical and social changes between 1900 and 2000.  
       b)   A two-part assignment based upon the computer simulation program SIMCITY 3000, by Maxis.  Click [here](simcity.htm) for details.  
  
2) Participation in Discussion (10%)  
        a) Participation in  [the course's bulletin board](https://www1.columbia.edu/sec/bboard/011/urbs3525-001/threads.html)  (10%). You will be expected to participate regularly (you should post at least one message every two weeks) in this virtual discussion.   With your help, it will be a thought-provoking and wide-ranging (but intellectually disciplined) conversation about modem urbanism around the world.   
  
3) Exams (60%)  
       a) Mid-Term Exam (25%)  
       b) Final Exam (35%)  
Exams will be based primarily upon materials presented in lectures, although
you will also be responsible for everything posted on, or linked to, the
course website. The exams will consist of both short-answer identifications
and short-essay questions.  
  
_Note: It is expected and encouraged that in the spirit of intellectual
exploration students will discuss their work in this class with each other.
However, the written work for this class, including the assignments described
above and any messages posted on the course newsgroup should not be the
product of collaboration. Exams will be given under the Barnard College Honor
Code, which states that students do not ask for, give, or receive help in
exams and do not use papers or books in any manner not authorized by the
instructor.

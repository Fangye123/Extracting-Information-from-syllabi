**Prerequisites and University Studies Fulfillments**  
Human Geography has NO pre-requisites.  Human Geography partially fulfills the
General Education Program requirements for Curricula 3.  Human Geography is a
second level course and must be paired with either Culture:  The Human Mirror
or The Global Majority to receive full credit for Curricula 3.

**Goals and Objectives:**  
This course is designed to fulfill three roles.

> 1.  First, Human Geography is designed to introduce students to the
importance of place.  Throughout history people have imbued certain places
with special meaning.  Places come to have special meaning for individuals and
groups.  These meanings can last for centuries.  Jerusalem, for example, has
been a sacred place for Muslims, Christians, and Jews for thousands of years.
Indeed, each of these groups has at one time or another gone to war in an
effort to control how the city is defined, and thus its larger meaning.

> 2.  Second, Human Geography is designed to introduce students to the
processes that link places together, and how these linkages effect individual
places.  Understanding such processes is crucial if we are to understand how
events in one part of the world have effects in other parts of the world, and
how these effects play out on the landscape.  The implementation of NAFTA, for
example, has led to a clustering of economic development along a narrow swatch
of land along the US/Mexico border.  Other places in Mexico have actually
experienced economic declines since the passing of NAFTA.

>

> 3.  Third, Human Geography is designed to introduce you to the discipline of
Geography and how this discipline is important in a liberal arts education.
My hope is that you will leave with an understanding of the discipline, its
place in the Social Sciences, and basic geographic skills that can one day
help you get a job.

  
**Basic Expectations:**  
American University is a community in which students, faculty, and staff
pursue intellectual growth.  To facilitate this pursuit of knowledge American
University has established a Rights, Responsibilities, and Code of Conduct
guideline for its members.  These guidelines can be found in the University
Catalogue.  Students should familiarize themselves with all of these
guidelines.  I would like to highlight some of these and other guidelines that
I think are especially pertinent to this class:

> **1.  ** **No Cheating or Plagiarism**.   The university takes these
offenses seriously and so do I.  If you are found cheating on an exam or
plagiarizing in a paper, you will receive an automatic F on that assignment.

>

> **2.   Be On Time**:  Coming to class late is DISRUPTIVE and RUDE to both
the instructor and your peers.  If you can not make it to this class on time,
then you should consider dropping the course and adding one that you can get
to on time.

>

> **3.  ** **No Newspapers**.   If you want to read the newspaper during class
time then do it somewhere besides this room.

>

> **4.  ** **Proper Notification**.   Students are entitled to an excused
absence for the purpose of observing major religious holidays.  The student
must, however, notify me IN WRITING well in advance of the date of the
holiday.  In addition, if you need to miss an exam or assignment, you must
notify me prior to the due date, and provide appropriate verification for why
you can not be present (e.g. doctor's excuse).  In cases of emergency students
should obtain proper documentation (e.g. accident report) as well as notify me
as soon as possible.

>

> **5.  ** **Open Dialogue.  ** During the semester unexpected things might
happen to you (girlfriend or boyfriend breaks up with you, crazy roomates,
existential angst, etc.) that will affect your performance in this class.  I
understand these difficulties and am willing to work with you to overcome
them.  I can only do so, however, if you let me know about it WHILE it is
affecting you.  If you come to my office at the end of the semester and tell
me that the reason you failed the first exam is because you had a personal
problem, there is nothing I can do for you.  If you come to me before the
first exam and tell me what is going on, I can try to help you.

> _Exams_ combine multiple choice questions, definitions, short answer
questions, and one essay.   Exams will cover material from the lectures and
the textbook.  Exams are NOT cummulative

>

> _The Project_ is designed to give you the opportunity to apply knowledge
learned in this class to ''real-life'' problems.   I will announce the
specifics of the project assignemnt during the semester.

>

> _The Map Test_   is designed to test your knowledge of the location of
geographical features.  For this test you will be expected to mark the
location of physical (rivers) and social (cities) features on blank maps.  You
will also be responsible for certain factual information pertaining to these
features.  One week before the test I will provide you with a detailed list of
the features you are expected to memorize as well as blank maps for
practicing.

#  Christian Mysticism

###  Fall 2001: Wednesday 3:10-5:00

###  Div 138

This course will focus on the tradition of Christian asceticism and mysticism,
beginning with the cult of the martyrs and moving through the development of
monasticism.  
    Bernard McGinn's _The Presence of God: A History of Western Mysticism_ will serve as a general introduction and guide to the subject matter.   Volume 1: _The Foundations of Mysticism_ and Volume 2:   _The Growth of Mysticism_ are available through the bookstore.   Individual sections of these volumes will be suggested for each meeting of the class but students should use the texts as a general resource.   


###  Seminars

After the introductory meeting, a short lecture will conclude each class,
providing an introduction to the topic and readings for the following meeting.
The students will then read primary materials in English translation and
prepare a short written report the readings for that week, which will then be
distributed through the electronic mail list for the class to the other
students prior to the class meeting.
[DIV322B@list.vanderbilt.edu](mailto:div322b@list.vanderbilt.edu) This paper
should not be a summary of the reading or an attempt to provide an
comprehensive analysis of it.  Rather it should concentrate on one point or
two at most which the student regards as particularly important for
understanding the viewpoint of the author of the development of mystical
theory and practice.  
    Students will then engage in class discussions.  Attendance at the weekly meetings of the class is mandatory and notice should be provided of any anticipated absence.   
    Some of the readings will be available as texts to be purchased through the bookstore, others will be downloaded from the website, through the schedule of readings below.  Students are not required to purchase the textbooks; they may use copies from the Vanderbilt or other libraries. 

###  Research Paper

A research paper of about twenty pages on one topic or author will be
required.  The subject matter may come from the readings for the course.  
    The topic for the research paper must be submitted by October 10.   
    A preliminary outline or draft which clearly indicates the scope, method and materials to be used for the paper must be submitted by November 7.   
    The final version of the paper must be submitted by December 19. 

###  Grading

Grading will be based upon the three forms of student participation in the
course:  the reading reports, contributions to the discussion, and the
research paper.  The research paper will be counted for no more than 50% of
the grade.  


###  Communication

The students in the course may communicate with each other and the instructor
by means of the electronic mail list for the course.  All mail sent to this
list will be automatically distributed to everyone registered for the course.
This means should be used for distributing the weekly reading reports, no
later than noon on each Wednesday, in advance of the meeting. Students may
also use this means to continue the discussion of the seminars and to assist
each other in interpreting the texts.  
    Regular updates of the syllabus will be made throughout the course, with suggested readings from McGinn and additional resources for the topics under consideration.  Students should check the web version of the syllabus often.

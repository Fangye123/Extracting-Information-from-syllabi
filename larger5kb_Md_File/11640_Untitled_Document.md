# The Aim of this Course:

**The aim of this course is to present a synthesis of current views and
understanding of urban problems in a comparative perspective, with a special
focus on the question of diversity. The issues of class, ethnicity, gender,
and lifestyle diversity are particularly poignant today in major American
cities. Conflicts arising from racial discrimination and residential
segregation, income polarization, and more recently, lifestyle choices have
plagued American cities for some time. Recently the diversity issue has become
more critical with a growing influence of immigrant cultures. The visible
presence of a Third World workforce manning the low wage jobs, of the Third
World entrepreneurs driving the local service or the high-tech economy, and
their adaptations of urban space and landscape in the form of Chinatowns,
Koreatowns, and Little Saigons, have prompted the popular media to liken major
American cities as Third World cities. Thus we hear such characterizations
like Los Angeles as the "Capital of the Third World," or New York as a
"Calcutta on the Hudson." There is an inescapable sub-text to these Third
World City metaphors. To a large extent this is also a reference to the
perceived decline of quality of life, and to the images of expanding poverty,
hunger, homelessness and welfare dependency in American cities.  
It is appropriate therefore to examine the issues of class, ethnic, gender and
lifestyle diversity of Los Angeles and other American cities against the
historical and contemporary development of selected Third World cities. There
are two very compelling reasons why such a broad and historic approach is
essential for understanding issues in diversity. For one, much of our
contemporary conflicts among classes and racial groups will be shaped, and
exacerbated in some instances, by the emerging global economic order. To take
two obvious aspects of this change -- increasing labor mobility and
international immigration, and the ever-expanding influences of American
consumerism and pop culture facilitated by the revolutions in information and
entertainment technologies -- have already made them major sources of
conflicts here and abroad. Such popular themes as Third-Worldization of
America, on the one hand, and "Jihad vs. McWorld" on the other, capture these
tensions inherent in the changing global economic order and hegemonic
relationships between countries.  
For another, it can be argued that almost all of traditional social conflicts
that we consider a problem of class and ethnicity cannot be fully understood
without a critical knowledge of the changes in the world order through
centuries of colonial expansion and underdevelopment. A historical perspective
at a macro level is critical for this understanding. Recent crisis in Rwanda
and Zaire is a case in point. The rivalry between Hutus and Tutsis, who used
to live in peace for many years, and seemingly unconcerned about their ethnic
differences, is simply an artifact of colonial exploitation of those people.
Those familiar with the British rule of India are also aware of the similar
strategy used by the colonial Raj by playing Hindus against Muslims in a
classic Machiavellian fashion.  
Finally, the class will focus on the theories and models of Third World
urbanization and development that are particularly meaningful in developing
alternative perspectives and understanding of diversity issues relevant to the
domestic context. Some of these ideas will be presented as arguments, others
as possible models, but always in a comparative frame of reference. Thus the
"Third World" metaphor will be pressed deliberately to provoke the students,
to stimulate them to branch out, to challenge them to see the relevance of
these concepts and to explore on their own the transferability of the Third
World experience to conceptualize diversity issues in the domestic context.
The following are some specific examples:**

**(1) The Question of Tastes and Preferences: Students may consider the visual
appearance of the ethnic and immigrant neighborhoods from an understanding of
the origin of the respective cultural landscapes. They may appreciate the fact
that the slightly curved eaves lines, blue-tiled roofs, front porches painted
in red, or controversies over tree removal, curb cuts and placement of fire
hydrants in some suburbs of Los Angeles are actually being dictated by the
ancient principles of "Feng Shui." They should learn that what seems to be
"weird" or "strange" adaptations in the physical context of American cities,
are in fact expressions of a cultural belief system that values correctness of
one's bearing in a metaphorical landscape.**

**(2) Social Conflicts: Understanding of the nature of family and house forms
in the Third World context should help students to understand the cultural
basis of some of the social conflicts that are common in immigrant
neighborhoods. Multiple but related families sharing one house in a single-
family neighborhood may be a violation of the zoning code, but it is also an
extension of an established lifestyle in a different cultural context. Garage
conversions, "mansion houses" may simply be adaptations of a different concept
of "family," albeit alien to the nuclear family culture of the West.**

**(3) Homelessness: Students will be encouraged to explore the transferability
of some of the concepts relevant to squatters and pavement dwellers -- i.e.
"spontaneous settlements," marginality, and the like -- to analyze the growing
phenomenon of homelessness in American cities.**

**(4) Dualism: As the polarized economy of Los Angeles leads to a partitioning
of urban space into a service-dependent "public" city and a free-market
"privatized" city, the concept of dualism commonly used in describing Third
World cities and economies offers an appropriate model. An assignment
requiring a walk (and photo documentation) along Broadway and Figueroa in
downtown Los Angeles might make the concept of a dualistic city all too
palpable in the domestic context.**

**(5) Human and social costs of gender inequality: The Third World development
experience has documented the enormous human and social costs of gender
inequality in education, in health, in income, in occupation, in mortality and
morbidity, and the like. Examples of chronic neglect and cruelty toward women,
including female infanticide will be presented in this class. The
understanding of the cultural roots of institutionalized neglect of women in
many Third World countries should sensitize the students about the gender
issues in the domestic context.**

**(6) Marginality and internal colonialism: Models of colonialism are used not
only to describe the Third World urban development, but also to model the
emerging social ecology of the American metropolis. Students might be asked to
consider whether the American suburbia could be seen as having a colonizing
relationship with the derelict inner city, for example.**

**(7) Informal economy: The nature of informal economy and its linkages with
the formal sector economy is a major topic to be explored in this class. This
is also a useful concept to describe and categorize certain aspects of the
highly diverse economy of the Los Angeles region.**

**(8) Rural-urban migration: Migration is a common theme in describing the
growth of Third World cities. But the human dimensions of the rural-urban
migration are relevant in describing the multi-ethnic diversity of the Los
Angeles area. Typically we show the first part of the film, "El Norte" to
illustrate the experience of rural-urban migration. With the diversity
requirement the whole film (despite its length) will be apropos since the
journey of the two Salvadoran siblings terminates in Los Angeles.**

**(9) Dependency: Dependency is another concept that can be taken from the
Third World development context and applied to social and economic
relationships between income classes within the American city. The crowded
quarters and neighborhoods of poor and undocumented workers who are
permanently dependent on the formal sector economy for livelihood and
protection can be presented as a spatial outcome of this process.**

**(10) Culture of Poverty: This is a classic concept that has been used
historically to justify the marginalization of the urban poor in the Third
World, and also to blame the inner city minority groups of American cities.
Enduring public policies of "benign neglect" have been created and legitimized
by this model in both worlds. Comparative discussions should be enlightening
for the students.**

**Paper Assignments:  
Students will be required to write a research paper focusing on a Third World
city, to be selected from a list of cities. Each student in effect will adopt
a city for the duration of the semester and become a class expert on that
city. The general aim of this paper is to examine in detail the history and
evolution of the spatial structure and urban form of the city, and how the
city is being affected by forces of globalization today.  
The assignment has three distinct parts: (a) background research; (b) history
of the city's development; and (c) an aspect of recent change in the city's
economy, physical development, population growth, or urbanism. focusing on
issues of diversity or globalization in a comparative perspective.  
(a) Background: The students will receive an interim bibliography as soon as
they choose the cities. In the next five weeks, students will be required to
supplement the initial bibliography with additional library research, and
develop a more comprehensive bibliography, including web sites relevant for
research on their respective cities. <due: 9/21>  
(b) Development History: The first half of the paper will focus on the history
of the city's growth and development, discussing various phases of its growth
or decline, supplemented by historical maps, charts, and the like. <due:
10/12>  
(c) Contemporary Condition: The second half of the paper will discuss how the
city is being affected by the challenges of social and cultural diversity,
and/or forces of globalization. These topics can be addressed in a comparative
perspective, using Los Angels or another American city as a frame of
reference. <due: 11/30>**

**Total length of the paper is expected to be between 2500 to 3000 words (10
to 12 pages of double-spaced text, not counting bibliography, illustrations,
and tables), each half being 1250 to 1500 words long. Papers must draw from
the concepts and themes discussed in class and/or included in the required
reading materials. In addition students will be expected to present materials
from their research in class discussions.**

|  GRADUATE READING LISTS: U.S. FIELD LIST #2

EARLY AMERICA: THE AGE OF REVOLUTIONS

Drafted by Tom Slaughter and Jan Lewis; updated by Paul Clemens, 7-20-2000

Reading List and Bibliography

This list was completed for the Fall 2000 offering of PDR-II; it includes
works assigned in Fall 1998 (*) or Fall 2000 (*) as well as those recommended
as additional works.

This colloquium provides an introduction to major historical and
historiographical problems associated with Anglo-North America from roughly
1700 into the 1820s. The syllabus and bibliography incorporate a variety of
methodological and philosophical perspectives on early American history --
politics, culture, law, ethnicity, economy, geography, society, race,
religion, philosophy, ideology, and gender are represented in the readings.
There is also a mix of older and more recent writings. We will attempt,
individually and collectively, to synthesize specialized studies into larger
understandings of causality, continuity, and change.

The American Revolution, as an event and as a process, will be a central focus
of the course, especially as seen within the larger contexts of "the age of
revolutions" and historiographical controversy. The Revolution will be
considered as a social, cultural, economic, political, and ideological process
with profound consequences for the American people. We will discuss the
Revolution's meanings for common folks and for those living at the fringes of
economic subsistence and political power, in addition to considering the
ambitions of the founding fathers. The long-term preconditions for revolution
will be explored within the contexts of international political and
intellectual influences reaching back to the seventeenth century; and the
consequences of the Revolution looking forward into the nineteenth century
will also be discussed. We will put special emphasis on the comparative
context of the American Revolution by considering 17th-century English
revolutions and 18th-century revolution in France, Haiti, and Latin America.

We have also tried to place British North America in an Atlantic context. This
will occasion reading on the British empire, Africa and the slave trade, and
Latin American colonial development.

The reading list is intended to be a general selective introduction to the
history and historiography of the chronological period covered in the course;
and it is used in preparing the Early American questions for the Masters and
Ph.D. qualifying examinations in American history. If your major field is
Early American/Early Modern European history, you should have a general
familiarity with all the titles on the list. If you are preparing for the
Ph.D. qualifying examination in American history, you should have read at
least two books and several articles or more from each of the fourteen weeks
on the list. As one book and several articles from each week will be assigned
in the course, this means you are essentially being asked to read on your own
at least one additional book and an article or two for every book and article
assigned in class. The amount of reading is not, of course, a sufficient index
of how well prepared you are for the qualifying examination; these lists are
simply meant to provide common ground for those studying Early American
history. Your ability to discern and address the themes and questions that
this literature raises is the most significant indication of how well you
understand the field.

Note: books preceded with a star (*) have been used in the one of the last two
PDRs. Classic works and especially valuable source books are listed at the end
of each section. Overviews of a topic are listed first.

are responsible primarily for how the British empire developed in North
America.)

**Examinations**

There will be three examinations in this course. All examinations will consist
of a combination of essays and short-answer questions. Each examination will
count 25% of the course grade. Exam I will cover the Thompson book and pages
1-102 in Dziewanowski. Exam II will cover pages 103-285 in Dziewanowski. Exam

Exams I and II cannot be made up. For students who miss any of these
examination(s), there will be a comprehensive make-up examination administered
in lieu of Exam III, and this examination will count for Exam III as well as
for any examination(s) missed. Students must receive credit for all
examinations in order to receive a passing grade in the course.

A 6-8 page term paper will count 20% of the course grade. The paper will deal
with the general theme "The Promise of the Revolution." All papers must
conform to specific format requirements; see checklist at
<http://www.ipfw.edu/ipfwhist/home/hints.htm> for these requirements

**Class Participation**

While no specific grade is awarded for in-class participation, such
participation can be a factor in the determination of the course grade. Credit
can be earned for contributions to class discussions. Students are encouraged
to ask questions and make observations before and during lectures. The
assigned readings are intended to supplement and expand upon the lectures, and
not all materials in the readings will be covered in lectures. Therefore, if
the readings require explanation, students are expected to avail themselves of
the discussion periods to seek clarification. As much time as necessary will
be devoted to these discussions.

  
**Recording Devices/Students with Disabilities**

Department of History policy prohibits the use of recording devices in the
classroom unless there is a special need. Students with such needs should
consult with the instructor.

If you have or acquire a disability and would like to find out what special
services and accommodations may be available to you, contact Services for

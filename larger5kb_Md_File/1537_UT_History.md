I. Introduction to the Course**_  
The Honors Readings Conference is built on the close, intensive reading and
discussion of important texts. Students in Section 03 read works from the late
Renaissance through the late twentieth century.

This section has several goals, among which are:  
1\. to acquaint students with a variety of landmark works from several
different cultures  
2\. to encourage students to see and understand these texts in their
historical and literary contexts  
3\. to promote debate and the exchange of ideas among well-prepared students  
4\. to sharpen skills in research, writing, speaking and analysis. _ **

II. Reading List**_  
There are seven virtues, seven deadly sins, seven wonders of the world, but
eight books for this section.

Niccol o Machiavelli, _The Prince and the Discourses_  
Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, _Essays_  
William Shakespeare, _Othello_  
Henry Louis Gates, ed., _Classic Slave Narratives_  
Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, _The Communist Manifesto_  
Sigmund Freud, _Dora: Analysis of a Case of Hysteria_  
Leslie Marmon Silko, _Ceremony_  
Toni Morrison, _Beloved_ **

III. Course Requirements**  
The Honors Readings Conference provides a valuable opportunity for the
exchange of ideas among a small group of well-prepared students. Students
should come to class ready to take the lead in discussion of the week's
reading. The instructor's role is to moderate discussion, provide background
when needed, and raise questions. Only regular, thoughtful participation from
all class members will ensure a worthwhile experience. It is therefore
essential to keep up with the reading! In preparing for discussions, students
should think beyond the narrative of each text. They should become sensitive
to more profound issues, including ethics, the author's intentions, why the
work is considered  "great," thematic links with other texts, and so on. On
several occasions, the class may divide into pro and con sides for a formal
debate on issues raised by the readings; on other occasions, a team of
students may be assigned to lead the days discussion.

Attendance at class is required except in the case of illness. Repeated
unexcused absences will result in a failing grade even if a student has
completed the written work.

There are _five_ writing assignments for this section. _

First and second_ , students will write two short formal essays on the
readings. The ground rules for these two assignments follow.

1\. You may write on any reading you wish, but you must turn in the first
paper by Thurs., Feb. 5. The second is due no later than Thurs., Mar. 19.

2\. The essays can discuss any important theme in the reading; _must be typed
and double-spaced with standard margins and font size_ ; should be 3- 4 pages;
and must properly footnote all references and quotations. Be sure the essay
has a descriptive title.

3\. The essay should display clear, concisely written prose free from jargon,
grammatical errors, and other weaknesses.

4\. The instructor will read and comment on these essays and return them with
a grade. Students are encouraged to seek constructive criticism of their ideas
and their writing from the instructor and from the Writing Center in advance
of submitting their papers.

The _third_ writing assignment takes the form of an ongoing journal in which
you record your reactions to each reading assignment. In a minimum of two
paragraphs, engage the work you have been reading. You may like to write an
answer to one or more of the following questions:

What themes in this work echo the themes I've seen in the readings from fall
semester? (such as: human will; ethics and morality; freedom and enslavement).

What is most confusing about this reading? Be precise! What is most inspiring
about this reading? Again -- be precise! What in this reading makes me angry
(or uncertain, or skeptical, etc.), and why do I respond that way?

Does this work belong in the Honors Readings Conference  "canon?" Is it a
great work? Why or why not?

Bring these journal entries to class each week. They will serve as the basis
for part of our discussion of the works in question. You may also find that
you get ideas for your papers from your journal entries. You may type these
writing assignments if you like, but you are not required to do so. You may
also take the notes on your computer and submit them to the instructor via
e-mail provided you bring a hard copy to class. The instructor will
periodically check that the assignments have been completed and return them to
the students.

The _fourth_ writing assignment is to send the instructor at least two e-mail
letters during the semester. You can send anything you like, such as comments
on the reading, questions about a paper, observations about politics, the
weather, whatever. The purpose is to make each student aware of the ease of
communicating by e-mail. The instructors address is at the top of the
syllabus.

The _fifth_ writing assignment is a 10-12 page paper due anytime during the
semester, but no later than Tuesday, April 28, in class. Please note that
since this is the last possible time the instructor can accept papers and
grade them on time, she will not grant extensions. Your assignment here is to
write an essay in the style of Michel de Montaignes essays. The ground rules
are as follows:

1\. You must choose a topic of significance on which to write, although you
may approach this topic in a variety of ways.

2\. You must follow the rules of the essay as Montaigne devised them: clear
writing and organization; appropriate references to accepted sources of
wisdom; examination of oneself and of ones assumptions. Your citations must
come from the works themselves and not from collections of quotations (such as
Bartletts).

3\. There must be a philosophical coherence to your essay.

4\. You must fully document, using standard footnote and bibliographic forms,
all materials you consult.

The instructor urges you to discuss this exercise with her before you commit
yourself to a topic. She further recommends that students take this and all
other papers to the Writing Center for feedback during the writing process.

The _approximate_ value of each exercise in the computation of final grades is
as follows:

First paper: 10%  
Second paper: 20%  
Journal and e-mail: 10%  
Final paper: 30%  
Participation in class discussion: 30%

The instructor looks very favorably on improvement in calculating the final
grades. _ **

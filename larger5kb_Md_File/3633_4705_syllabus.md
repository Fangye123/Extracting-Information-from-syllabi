![course requirements](requirements.gif)  

**All written work** **must be typed and double-spaced** unless otherwise
noted. You must use at least a 12-point font for all assignments. Attach all
pages with either a staple or paper clip. LATE ASSIGNMENTS will be accepted
_at the discretion of the instructor_ , and _will_ carry a "late fee".
Assignments will be considered late if they are incomplete in any way (and
must be handed back ungraded), including, but not limited to:

  * Lack of peer review (if required).
  * No name on the assignment.
  * Using a smaller font than 12-point.

**_Gateway:_ In order to pass this class** with a grade of **C** or better,
each student must demonstrate the ability to write clear, meaningful
behavioral objectives. This will be determined by performance on lesson plans
or on additional assignments given by the instructor.

**Do Three Before Me:**

In order to assist students in taking more responsibility for their own
learning, students are required to do at least _three_ of the following things
before asking a question of the instructor. (This obviously does not apply to
class discussions!):

  1. Read the syllabus.  

  2. Look at the course webpage.
  3. Ask a peer.
  4. Read the textbook.
  5. Look in the course packet.
  6. Read your notes.
  7. Read the directions.
  8. Go to the library.
  9. Look at a reliable Internet site.
  10. Read comments on previous assignments.

_Specific requirements:_

1.Attendance is mandatory. Your grade will be lowered by 10 points for the
second and each subsequent absence. Two tardies equal one absence. I know that
parking is difficult on campus. It has been that way since at least 1955. Plan
for it. If you must be absent, then you are responsible for getting any missed
work from your classmates. (See "[ Important
Concepts](http://pm.appstate.edu/%7Emamlinnl/concepts.htm) " on my homepage)

2.Participation in classes is also mandatory, and is part of the grade. All
reading assignments are to be completed by the date shown on this schedule.

3.Completion of various in-class activities and occasional brief homework
assignments will be expected beyond what is currently listed in the syllabus.

4.Quizzes on-line. Students will be required to complete six on-line quizzes
available on the textbook webpage ([
http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mercer/](http://cwx.prenhall.com/bookbind/pubbooks/mercer/)
). Quizzes are due in my email box on the days indicated. Your "sent" time
should be no later than 8:30a.m. to receive credit. Please send the file to me
as "attached html". **30 points**

5.A [ portfolio](http://pm.appstate.edu/%7Emamlinnl/portfolio.htm) , described
in detail on the course homepage, will demonstrate your mastery of course
content in relationship to your internship, the rest of the block, and/or
other assigned experiences. There are various due dates for different parts of
the portfolio, but the entire portfolio is due at the first class meeting
after the internships are over. **375 points**

6.Upon return from the internship, each student will prepare a [
poster](http://pm.appstate.edu/%7Emamlinnl/final.htm) which will synthesize
the events of the semester. This will be explained in more detail later in the
semester and on the course homepage. This presentation will be worth **40
points** .

7.Listerv participation: Each class member is expected to contribute a total
of ten times- at least four times prior to the internship and on at least a
weekly basis during the internship. The messages must relate to course content
or special or general education issues. Instructors may initiate the
discussion early in the semester if necessary, but expect students to take the
lead in bringing up issues important to them and the class. **50 points.**

8.It will be in your best interest to use assignments from this class (and
other block classes) to meet your [advanced technology
competencies](http://www.dpi.state.nc.us/tap/advance.htm) . When you have an
artifact and rationale that you want me to check for you, please turn it in to
me. You must have all 24 competencies met prior to receiving certification and
passing student teaching.

9.All items handed in for a grade prior to the internship must be reviewed by
a peer before they will be graded. Peer checksheets are in the packet from
SOS. Each class member should serve as a peer reviewer on at least 5
assignments. There must be "proof" of the peer review in order for the peer to
receive credit. Proof can take the form of a draft and revised assignment
being handed in, or of the reveiwer's marks on the copy handed in. **15
points** (for peer reviewer) .

  
The following assignments and forms are detailed on my homepage. Please print
them from there. If you have any questions about them, please bring them up in
class or on the listserv.

>> Students who have taken this course/the block in the past will tell you
that there is a lot of work to do in a short amount of time! However, if you
stay organized and keep track of what is required, I am confident that you can
get everything done! Even though it may not seem so now, I have only included
assignments that I think are essential to help you in your careers as
teachers.

>> Teaching, and perhaps especially teaching students in special education
classes, is a complex, demanding job. It is also one of the best- and you can
do it!

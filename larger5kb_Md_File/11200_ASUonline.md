1. | Which topics in educational technology are of most interest to you?  
  |

Streaming media/video is my main interest. It's been amazing to see drastic
improvement in the quality of the tools and software over the last few years.  
  
2. | Which aspects of your education apply to what you do with Distance Learning and Technology?  
  |

Both my formal education, a masters in educational technology, and the OJT
that comes with every job (on-the-job training) have helped me to be effective
in this position. I always enjoy utilizing new media tools and technology to
create engaging online instruction/training. You learn from each project and
use this knowledge to make the next project better, either technically,
pedagogically, or both.  
  
3. | What are your areas of expertise?  
  |

Video production, streaming media, front-end analaysis, and project
management.  
  
4. | What do you feel is the most useful technology available today to online instructors and students?  
  |

In my opinion, I think the narrated PowerPoint slides are by far the best.
They're relatively easy to create and update/edit. One of the better lecture
on-demand tools.  
  
5. | Briefly describe your idea of a well-designed online course?  
  |

Naturally it must present material that covers the objectives of the course -
but beyond that, it should be engaging, to the point that students want to
participate, and that means interaction with the course's facilitator (not
necessarily it's author). Well designed also means that it is evolving and
improving with each semester's course evaluations and feedback - non-stagnant.  
  
6. | List 3 publications related to educational technology that you read on a regular basis.  
  |

Wired, T&D; (training and development), Syllabus  
  
7. | What work-related listservs or newsletters do you subscribe to?  
  |

These aren't all ed tech, per se, but all have implications/applications.
Wired, TechTV, New Scientist, Syllabus, OLNews, E-Learning Newline, EdTech
(ASU), eBiz Strategies, TRIZ Journal, DV News and Views, etc.  
  
8. | What professional organizations do you belong to?  
  |

ASTD (American Society for Training and Development)  
  
9. | What books related to web site design and development, educational technology, computers, the Internet, etc., would you recommend?  
  |

I enjoyed reading the "Victorian Internet". It's about the telegraph's
development and deployment. It draws very interesting parallels between the
telegraph and the current Internet. A very practical book that I've read is
"Teaching Oline". Excellent book for first-time online instructors.  
  
10. | What is your core software toolset?  
  |

Final Cut Pro 3, Cinestream, (Media) Cleaner 5, Microsoft Media Encoder 4.1.
These are all media editing and encoding tools.  
  
11. | What advice would you give an instructor who is new to online teaching?  
  |

The best advice I could recommend would be to talk to several other faculty
who have taught online.  
  
12. | Which workshops do you facilitate?  
  |

I've done several workshops about streaming media.

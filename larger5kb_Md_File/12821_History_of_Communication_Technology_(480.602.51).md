Throughout history, human beings have devised artifacts and practices to
create, transmit, store, and manipulate information. The introduction of new
communications technologies is often associated with periods of rapid cultural
development, as well as social conflict and dislocation. This course provides
a historical perspective on the role new communications media have had in the
evolution of western culture. We will explore questions such as: How, why, and
by whom are new communications systems created? What social and technical
functions do they perform? In what ways do new information technologies
challenge existing practices, social arrangements, and distributions of power?

We will begin by defamiliarizing two basic communications practices--writing
and painting--by uncovering the social meanings these new techniques had in
the very different contexts of post-Norman Conquest England and Renaissance
Italy. We then consider the impact of new communications technologies such as
the printing press, telegraph, telephone, and phonograph. Moving on to the
20th century, we will examine the evolution of broadcast media (radio and
television) and finally discuss the origins and prospects of today's digital
multimedia.

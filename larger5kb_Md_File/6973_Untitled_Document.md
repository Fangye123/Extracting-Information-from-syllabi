**_PROCEDURE:  
_**  
The purpose of the course is to assess the origin, durability, and intensity
of representative and influential ideas in the development of the American
ethos from the colonial period to the present. Close attention will be given
to individuals who defined ideas as well as to the social and cultural context
of ideas. A chronological approach will be used with additional emphasis on
ideological issues whose tenure transcend historical periods.  
  
Regular class attendance, completion of reading assignments, and participation
in discussion are strongly urged. The instructor can lower course grade by as
much as one letter for unexcused absences. There will be a midterm and final
exam as well as a term paper, the nature and scope of which will be determined
after the course begins. A term paper of 12-15 pages will be due **NOVEMBER
26**.  
  
In addition to books to be purchased and on reserve additional reading
material, identified as a  "Xeroxed Selection" will be distributed to each
student a week before their scheduled appearance in the syllabus. Thus
procedure is necessary in order to extend the range of sources without the
necessity for buying the books from which they are derived; a nominal charge
will be made to defray the cost of reproduction. Some of the readings on the
reserve list, moreover, are found in D. Hollinger and C. Cooper, The American
Intellectual Tradition , Volumes I and II. There will be five (5) copies of
each volume available to allow ready access to these materials designated (AIT
I or II) in the syllabus.

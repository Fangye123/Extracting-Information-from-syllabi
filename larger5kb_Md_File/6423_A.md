SEMINAR REQUIREMENTS

1\. Regular class attendance. Thorough reading of assignments. Spirited and
scholarly class discussion of your reading.

2\. Eleven 1-page papers, single-spaced. Ten Response and/or Position Papers
(at least two must be Position Papers) and one background research paper.
**Limited to 1-page each** , single-spaced. Bring 4 copies to class. These
will help you focus the material and your ideas and will facilitate seminar
discussion. Include (1) **Two questions** , either sincerely looking for an
answer or designed to see what others have to say, and (2) **Your comments
about the readings**. Some weeks you may have a Response Paper only (very
loosely organized reactions). At least twice you will write a Position Paper
(well-organized statement about a literary, theoretical, or cultural issue
about which you can articulate your view). Other weeks you may wish to combine
Response and Position. For one week you will have signed up to do some
background research on the material discussed for that seminar (bring copies
for all members of the seminar).

3\. **Critical Paper**. 12-15 pp. Precise MLA format.

  * Research one or two critical, theoretical, or cultural issues of pluralism in literature. Formulate a focused argument. You may expand any of your Response/Position Papers.  
OR  

  * Write a critical paper on any literary work(s) outside the Western European mainstream. You may use texts from the course syllabus if your approach is mostly outside of class discussion. You may expand any of your Response/Position Papers if appropriate. Refer to the views of other critics of the work(s) and make evident how your argument fits into the critical dialogue. Formulate a focused argument. 

Although you may re-work a short paper or presentation from another course,
using one project to fulfill requirements for two courses is not acceptable.

You will present your findings to the class informally (15 minutes, not
reading your paper).  
  

* * *

It is recommended that you sign up for a due date for the first draft of your
paper and meet with the professor before or after class, during regular office
hours, or by appointment, before turning in your final draft.

* * *

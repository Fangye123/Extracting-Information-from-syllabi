**_Course Description_**  
This course is organized around reading about and discussing the social
history of twentieth century American popular music. The goal of the course is
to explore important themes in American social and cultural history through
the study of popular music. During the semester students will critically
analyze the influence of technology, ideology, class, gender, and race on
various genres of music -- jazz, country, rhythm and blues, rock and hip hop.
Emphasis will be placed on understanding the social and cultural contexts of
the various music forms rather than on a rigorous understanding of the musical
forms themselves. No musical background or skills will be expected of students
in the course. (In other words, the course is a history course, not a music
course.)

Classes will operate in a discussion format, with brief lectures/comments
introducing the various weekly themes. In addition to participating in class
discussion, each student will prepare and deliver a 20 minute class
presentation.  On the day of their presentation, each student will submit a 7
page essay derived from their presentation. The major assignment for the
course is a 20 page research essay, due in the History Department office on
**_APRIL 30, 2002 AT 4PM_**.   In the closing weeks of the semester, each
student will be requested to deliver a brief presentation on the topic of
her/his research.  The topic for your research essay may include a study of a
specific genre of or theme in 20th century popular music.  You may discuss the
influences on, events related to, and impact of the genre or theme that you
select. Or you may submit an "annotated compilation" which provides an
organized history of the evolution and larger cultural/social significance of
the genre in question as well as a list of appropriate musical examples of the
genre. The aim of the research project is to encourage each student to apply
in a creative manner some of the critical ideas developed in the class to an
important genre of music or theme in the history of 20th century American
music.

**EVALUATION**

You will be evaluated in this course on the basis of your performance of the
work of the course.

The work of the course includes:

Class Participation: including weekly question submissions and quizzes and
exercises which may or may not be announced in advance of class (20% Assigned
Reading  
2 one hour exams and the final examination (40%)  
3 Short papers(40%)  


I assume you all to be mature adults of personal and scholarly integrity who
are here to learn.  This means that you have a strong desire to do the work of
the course to the best of your ability.  In turn, I have the responsibility to
present the work of the course to you as clearly and sensibly as possible.
If, at ANY time, you do not understand what you are being asked to do or to
know, please ask me to clarify the assignment.  While I always think I have
defined the work in an unambiguous way, past experience has taught me that
some of you will interpret what I have said differently from the way in which
I intended. It as ALWAYS better to discover these differences before the work
is complete than after.  Many of you will be reluctant to ask for further
explanation in class.  Get over it.  I can GUARANTEE that at least one other
person (usually more) has the same question and, rather than thinking you
dumb, they will be extremely grateful that you asked.  I will certainly not
think you dumb but rather an intelligent and conscientious student.  Or, at
least, one with a reasonable concern for his or her grade.

In this context, please remember that grades do not measure what you know or
can do.  They measure what you know or can do in relation to what I think you
should know or be able to do.  In this sense any grade is not an absolute but
a communication between me and you.  When I evaluate your tests and papers, I
do not take points off, I add them on.  It is important to me that you
understand what the letter grades used in the course mean.

C  is the base-line grade.   On an objective, 100 point scale, it means that
at least 70% of the information you have given is correct.  It means you have
satisfied all the requirements in an acceptable manner. This is not bad work.
It is the basic expectation of the course.

B  indicates above average work (80-90%).  It means that you have shown
qualities of thought and/or performance that exceed basic expectations.

A  indicates exceptional work  (90-100%).  It means that you have shown
qualities of thought and/or performance that far exceed basic expectations.
(We do well to remember that there is relatively less exceptional work in the
world.)

D  indicates below average work (60-70%).  This means that you have not
satisfied all requirements in an acceptable manner.

F  indicates work well below average (less than 60%).  It means that you have
failed to satisfy all the requirements in an acceptable manner.

If, at any time, you have questions about requirements, expectations or
grades, please come and see me.  My office hours are set aside to answer your
questions and to help you with your work as the assignments progress.  You
will find that questions arise after you begin the writing assignments and, if
this is not the night before the paper is due (a serious mistake, by the way),
you will learn more and improve your performance if you discuss your concerns
with me.  If you cannot come by during office hours, please contact me to make
an appointment at another time.

If you have any disability which would prevent your satisfying the
requirements of the course, please see me as soon as possible so that
accommodation can be arranged.

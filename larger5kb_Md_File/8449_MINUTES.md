instructor of Mathematics; the research award was given to Larr y Duffy,
professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry; and the service award went to Jim
Douglas, 4-H agent with the UAF Cooperative Extension Service. All the
nominees were given a round of applause. Chancellor Lind thanked the
Usibelli's for their contribut ion and continued support of the university. It
provides an opportunity to recognize the outstanding work that is done by our
faculty. Becky Phipps indicated that it is pleasure to come and see the
recipients. The awards are in their tenth year and na med for Emil Usibelli,
who had a dedication to education. Rewarding the faculty for their excellence
is an honor. \par \par \par \tab B.\tab Announcement of Emeriti Faculty Awards

\par IV\tab Comments from Chancellor, Marshall Lind - \par \par Chancellor
Lind spoke about the commencement ceremony that will take place this weekend.
Honorary degrees will be given t o four recipients including Corey Flintoff,
John Burns, David Salmon, Jaroslav Nesetrill. Commencement activities will
take place in our other communities at other dates. \par \par Chancellor Lind
indicated they are in the final stages for the IAB Director. The Athletics
Director is in the final stages. They have completed phone interviews and hope
to have finalists on campus within the next week. They are in the screening
stage for the Dean of Enrollment Management. The Registrar's recruitment is
underway. And, the Deanship of SALRM should be finalized within the next week.
\par \par Chancellor Lind spoke with representatives in Juneau to find out the
latest in terms of the budget. It is still to early to tell. There are
indicators that something might happen to the general bond issues. They
include the bioscience building, the West Ridge Research Building, and Lena
Point. Another bond issue speaks to the deferred maintenance needs, especially
in the rural locations. It might also include some money for helping TV C in
the event of a relocation. It is a good possibility there will be some general
obligation bond opportunities up for the voters. \par \par We are also
watching the work of the conference committee for the operating budget. There
are two figures--one from eac h side--$0 and $8 million dollars. Hopefully the
$8 million dollars will prevail. It is a long way from the $16.9 million that
we need. \par \par Chancellor Lind was asked about the initiatives for FY04.
They are waiting to see how the FY03 initiatives are funded. SAC has been
given the charge to look at this as soon as we see what the budget turns out
to be. \par \par We are moving ahead on the West Ridge Research Building. We
are going to be paying for it ourselves with some of the overhead cost
recovery. In addit ion we hope for $2 million dollars from the legislature. We
need the building and hope to open in October 2004. The Music department will
relocate to Harwood Hall during the renovation of the Fine Arts Building.
There will be a rededication of the Broo ks Building in September. They hope
to move into it this summer. \par \par There is a challenge to find additional
dollars for two projects that have gone out to bid. The costs came in so high
that we can't deal with them with the existing dollars. One is the cla ssroom
addition for the Bristol Bay campus. The other is a Learning Center at Fort
Yukon. We will be looking at other sources of funding. \par \par \par }\pard
\fi-720\li720\widctlpar\adjustright {\tab Guest Speaker - Craig Dorman, Vice
President for Research \par \par }\pard \widctlpar\adjustright {Craig Dorman
indicated that he has had the opportuni ty to meet a number of faculty and
appreciates the opportunity to address the Senate today. He would like to meet
informally with anyone else. He has spent a large amount of time in research
and education. He has been in Alaska for two months. As a me mber of statewide
he had been to Anchorage and Juneau to meet with faculty. \par \par The direct
responsibility for management of research and education lies with the
individual MAU's and faculty members. He will be working through the
administrations to assist them in helping faculty do their jobs better. He
does believe in strategies and planning. There is an opportunity for enhanced
collaboration. It is better for all of us if we are working together. To that
end, he has taken a couple of steps. He has asked the three provosts for
nominations for a systemwide research advisory council. He hopes that a
council of that nature can advise him on what the needs are for research and
what some of the concerns are including research climate, support for research
, the need for facilities, positions, how we manage and handle our indirect
cost recovery, etc. There is a whole range of issues. \par \par The second
reason for doing that is because of a resolution before the joint state
legislature. It talks about a jo int federal-state research and development
plan. It will put the university in a position to help define in terms of both
state and federal initiatives those items we should be spending our time on
most directly to help the state. \par \par His personal philosop hy is that in
a major research institution, such as the University of Alaska, it is
important to focus first on the need of the science itself. Part of that means
providing facilities, maintaining excellence in areas that are appropriate and
unique to th e nature of the institution, maintaining the capacity to support
science as a whole. Secondarily, its important for a state university to be
very responsive to the needs and interests of the state. \par \par }\pard

Tremarello said working with the Faculty Senate over the years has been very
rewarding for her. Retention is going to be very important for UAF over the
next few years. Faculty are so important for retention. What makes the
difference is the teachi ng and learning that students get here--the
individual attention. She emphasized that the faculty are the reason for
student retention. Ann Tremarello recognized Gayle Gregory as a driving force
in the work of her office. \par \par Colleen Abrams, Coordinator of On-line

{V\tab Governance Reports \par \par \tab A.\tab ASUAF - D. Miller \par \par
Derek Miller said that they have finalized the budget for ASUAF of
approximately $400,000. It includes three major items including the KSUA-TV
station. This will be a student run television station. Also included is
increased funding for the Sun Star newspaper. They are looking at adding color
and increasing the quality. A student assistant Leadership Coordinator
position has been established for next year. For the first time ever, they
were able to include items for TVC such as coffee and tutors. \par \par The
blood drive was very successful with 162 people participating and 116 unit
collected. They were happy to provide that service. \par \par The student
senate passed a resolution supporting the curriculum, advising, and program
planning (CAP). This will be presented to the Chancellor and the Provost. A
copy will go to the Faculty Senate leadership. They also passed a resolution
making Joe Hayes the first ASUAF president-emeritus. He has done so much for
ASUAF, for students in general at UAF, and the whole university. He has
continued his support for the university. \par \par ASUAF will be hosting a
retirement reception for Dean Kirts at 5:00 p.m. today. \par \par \par \tab
B.\tab Staff Council - S. McCrea \par \par Scott McCrea was not available for
a report. \par \par \par \tab C.\tab President's Comments - N. Swazo \par \par
Norm Swazo asked who had received a letter from former faculty member Mr.
Sengupta. He responded to M r. Sengupta denying his request for a resolution
from the Faculty Senate. He did so having investigated the U.S. Supreme Court
disposition and the Alaska Supreme Court decision. The University of Alaska
prevailed on all counts forward from the initial g r ievance procedure hearing
through the litigation to the Supreme Court. There was clearly no basis in
Senate policy and procedure, no basis in university policy and procedure for
the Senate to take action. A letter has been transmitted to Mr. Sengupta in
forming him of that decision. \par \par The evaluation of administrators has
been ongoing. This is the first time we are using the new policy on review.
The review of the Dean of the Graduate School Joe Kan has been completed. The
Provost has meet with the ad h oc committee and the Faculty Appeals and
Oversight Committee and he is preparing his own final supervisor's comments.
Dean Kan has announced his retirement at the end of the next academic year.
\par \par The second dean undergoing review is Dean Vera Alexander. It is
moving slower and they hope to have their review completed later in May. Norm
Swazo expects that since members of the Faculty Appeals & Oversight committee
may not be present to meet in joint session with the ad hoc committee
conducting that review, the Provost may choose to meet with the Administrative
Committee when that report becomes available. \par \par Provost Reichardt is
due to be reviewed next year. \par \par Godwin Chukwu spoke about the current
evaluation of Dr. Kan and indicated that the process is still on going. He
pointed out that the process and guidelines that were put together last year
are working very well. \par \par Norm Swazo, on behalf of the Faculty Senate,
presented to Sheri Layral a certificate of appreciation for outstanding
service during academic year 2001-2002. Godwin Chukwu and Jane Weber presented
a gift certificate and card. \par \par \par \tab D.\tab President-Elect's
Comments - G. Chukwu \par \par Godwin Chukwu thanked the senators for their
support over the past year. One remarkable achievement was the establishment
of the UAF Senate newsletter. It has worked well; it has been very informative
and we have used it to reach a lot of faculty. We want to use it as an
information forum with things related to the Faculty Senate. We hope to have
continued contribution next year from all the senate members about their
colleges/schools. \par \par Godwin Chukwu asked for approval of the following

an employer has their own site, there will be a link. All the on-campus
recruitment's are also posted on the job board. It's a hot item now for
student jobs for the summer. The second items is an update on Career Expo. It
was the largest emp l oyer event on this campus. There were 70 employers and
1,150 applicants. The Faculty Senate co-sponsor a reception for the employers
and faculty and staff. This provided a great opportunity to network with
employers. Employers said they had three top skills they are looking for when
recruiting at UAF: communication, work ethics, and a positive attitude.
Technical skills are further down the list. They want someone they can teach,
that they can talk to, and that is going to have the right attitude a nd work
ethic. \par \par Tonya Trabant is looking for input in two areas: the on-

\par Other Than Assignment of Grades \par }\pard \ri720\widctlpar\adjustright
{\cf1 \par \par I. Introduction \par \par The University of Alaska is
committed to th e ideal of academic freedom and so recognizes that academic
decisions (i.e., non-admission to or dismissal from any UAF program) are a
faculty responsibility. Therefore, the University administration shall not
unduly influence or affect the review of acad emic decisions that are a
faculty responsibility. \par \par The following procedures are designed to
provide a means for students to seek review of academic decisions alleged to
be arbitrary and capricious. Before taking formal action, a student must
attempt to reso lve the issue informally. A student who files a written
request for review under the following procedures shall be expected to abide
by the final disposition of the review, as provided below, and may not seek
further review of the matter under any other p rocedure within the university.
\par \par \par II. Definitions \par \par }\pard
\fi-360\li360\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 A. As used in the schedule for
review of academic decisions, a class day is any day of scheduled instruction,
excluding Saturday and Sunday, included on the academic calendar in effect at
the time of a re view. Final examination periods are counted as class days.
\par \par B. "Department Chair" for the purposes of this policy denotes the
administrative head of the academic unit offering the course (e.g., head,
chair or coordinator of an academic department, or divi sion coordinator or
program chair if the faculty member is in the College of Rural Alaska). \par
\par C. The "dean/director" is the administrative head of the college or
school offering the course or program from which the academic decision or
action arises. For s tudents at extended campuses the director of the campus
may substitute for the dean/director of the unit offering the course or
program. \par \par D. The next regular semester is the fall or spring semester
following that in which the disputed academic decision wa s made. For example,
it would be the fall semester for a final grade issued for a course completed
during the previous spring semester or summer session. The spring semester is
the next regular semester for an academic decision made during the previous
fall semester. \par }\pard \ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 \par \par III.
Procedures \par \par }\pard \fi-360\li360\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 A.
A student wishing to appeal an academic decision other than a grade assignment
must first request an informal review of the decision. \par }\pard
\li720\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 \par }\pard
\fi-360\li720\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 1. Notification must be
received by the Provost within 15 days from the first day of instruction of
the semester in which the decision takes effect. \par \par 2. There may be
extenuating circumstances when the deadlines cannot be met due to illness,
mail disruption, or other situations over which the student may have no
control. In such a case, upon request from the student, the Provost, after
review of supporting documentation provided by the student, may adjust the
deadlines accordingly. An extension of the deadline will be limited to one
semester but every effort should be made to complete t he appeal process
within the current semester. \par \par 3. The Provost will request the
appropriate department chair to conduct an informal review of the decision.
The Department chair will determine whether the original decision should be
overturned or changed in any way. The department chair will submit his/her
recommendation to the provost through the dean/director within 10 days. In the
event that the department chair is directly involved, the provost can ask the
dean/director to conduct an informal review and submit his/her recommendations
directly to him. \par \par 4. The Provost will consult with the student on the
department chair's recommendation. If the student does not find that
recommendation acceptable, he/she may request the Provost to conduct a formal
review. \par }\pard \li720\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 \par }\pard
\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 B. The formal review will be conducted as
follows. \par \par }\pard \fi-360\li720\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 1.
This formal review is initiated by the student through a signed, written
request to the Provost. \par }\pard \li720\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1
\par }\pard \fi-360\li1080\ri720\widctlpar\adjustright {\cf1 a. The student's
request for formal review may be submitted using university forms specifically
designed for this purpose and available from the Office of the Provost. \par
\par b. By submitting a request for a review, the student acknowledges that no
additional mechanisms exist within the university for the formal review of the
decision, and that the universit y's administration including the college
dean/director can not influence or affect the outcome of the formal review.
\par \par c. The request for a formal review must be received no later than 10
days after the student has learned the outcome of the informal review (IIIA4).
\par \par d. The request must detail the basis for the allegation that the
decision was made on a basis other than sound professional judgment based upon
standard academic policies, procedures and practices. \par }\pard

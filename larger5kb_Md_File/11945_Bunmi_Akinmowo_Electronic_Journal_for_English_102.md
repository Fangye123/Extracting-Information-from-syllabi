Dear Journal,

    In my first week of English 102, I have learned much more than what I expected to to. When entering the class, I assumed that it would be a somewhat boring class, based on nothing but an abundance of literary reading and writing, but fortunately I was wrong. In the very first day of class, I learned that not only English, but also computers would be a subject that I would learn more about.

    In my very first class of English 102, I was told how the class would predominantly be based on computers. When hearing this, I was somewhat nervous because my only computer experience is America Online and Microsoft Word/Excel. I knew that I had about a week or two to decide whether I should drop the class or not, so instead of being scared by the first day of a new experience, I decided to do some research on Dr. Crew. After asking a couple of upper class men, my results were 50% of them saying that I should drop that class immediately, and the other half telling me that I it was an interesting but hard class, and that should stick with it. Even though I was nervous, after what I have presently learned, I have now chosen to stick with the class. So far, I have fortunately had the chance to learn how to create my very own personal home page, which is something that I have wanted to do for a very long time. In the very first class, I was able to learn step by step, how to create and publish my home page by using my pegasus account.  In my home page, I have been able to do things such as change its' color, and create links to my e-mail address and to other pages. Another page that I was able to create is my very own personal english web journal. In my journal, I was able to learn how to make tables, and links/targets for quick and easy reading.

    Although English has always been my worst subject since I am not a very good reader or writer, I think that this English 102 class, will change my opinion on how I feel about English. In my senior year of high school, I was fortunate enough to take AP English 102 (through Seton Hall University) which has hopefully prepared me somewhat for English this semester.  After looking at the syllabus, it seems like it will be a very interesting, yet challenging class. Due to the fact that all work and assignments will be done by computers, it will be very hard for me to ever get restless or distracted during class, which is a good thing. I also know that computers are a play a major role in society, therefore it would do me good to try to start getting accustomed to using one. I have read that there will also be guest speakers and audio poetry that we will listen to in the near future. Overall, it seems like it will be a hard and fast paced class with a lot to learn from. I know that in order for me to earn a good grade in this class, I will have to try my best to attend every class and pay close attention. This spring semester 2000, I will hopefully be fortunate enough to learn much more about English literature and poetry, and also computers.

   Dear Journal,  
    In my last English class, there was a guest speaker, Patrick Ssenjovu, an actor from Uganda. After an experience like that, I was happy that I was able to attend the class and did not chicken out and drop it, even though I thought about it.

    When I first started this English 102 class, I remember overlooking the syllabus, to see what I could expect. When looking at the course description, Thursday 1/22 had caught my attention. One reason why that specific day had interested me was because I had to continue to remind myself that we would be meeting in the regular classroom that day, and not in the computer lab. Even though I continued to remind my self, on Thursday when 4:00 p.m. came, and it was time for English class, I  still went straight to the lab and finally remembered at last minute that I had to go upstairs. The second reason why that specific day caught my attention was because I noticed not only that he was African, like me, but also that he was an actor. When I think of actor, I always think of fame and fortune, even though I know that is a big stereotype on actors/actresses. Since the name Patrick Ssenjovu was not familiar to me, I knew that he wasn't going to be a superstar, but I was still excited to meet him, and hear what he would have to say to a group of college students in an english class.

    When entering the class, and first seeing Patrick Ssenjovu, he looked like he an interesting person. He first started by introducing himself, and telling us about his career as actor. When telling us about his country, his facial expressions and body were in full effect, witch helped me to focus my attention on him. Another thing that I enjoyed about Patrick Ssenjovu was that he was very interactive with the class. He did things such as asking for volunteers, and trying to remember the names of people in the class. He also had us sing with him when demonstrating to us how acting in Uganda is different from acting in the United States. Instead of explaining how acting in Uganda is different from acting in the United States, he showed us with examples. I learned how in Uganda, actors/actresses do many things at once with a great amount of movement and rhythm involved. On the other hand, most actors/actresses here in America perform there scenes choreographed or just standing  on stage for an audience. This contrast made me stop and think about how the few African movies that I have seen compare to the American movies that I have seen.

    The thing that I like most about Patrick Ssenjovu was that he was an honest man. One of the first things he said about himself was that he was talking a voice class in order to lose his Uganda accent. He even did a demonstration on how actors are typecast by the way they talk walk, and especially the way they look. He was also honest, and encouraged the rest of the class to be honest, about who are truly good actors, and he even named a few actors the he thought he just terrible, such as Keanu Reeves and soap opera's. He did not try to say in any way that he was better than them or that they did not deserve their job, he was just letting us truly try to see what it means, and what it takes to be an actor. He made it a topic for us to give our opinion about what we assumed when we first saw him, and how he now knows that his past work in Uganda was trash compared to the actors and shows in America.

    Overall, I truly enjoyed having Patrick Ssenjovu as a guest speaker. He seems to be a very polite and outgoing man. Because of him, I will no longer take the hard work of actors for granted. Even though his family did not appreciate his decision to become an actor, he still went after his dreams. I wish that as I grow, I will be as ambitious as he is, and go after my dreams. By the way he presented himself in class, and the plans that he has for himself, I know that he will succeed in his acting career.

Dear Journal,

    A major topic in English 102 this week was phallic literature, and the "Snake," by D. H. Lawrence.  Both of these new topics were two ideas that I found to be very interesting and worth while.

    When first reading D. H. Lawrence's, the "Snake," I was very confused. It seems as if it was a good story, but do to the type of language and word choice that was used in it, I could not fully understand it. When first reading it, I assumed that it was about manhood. When stated, "And the voices in me said, If you were a man, you would take a stick and break him now," I thought that Lawrence was trying to explain how society, which was the voice, continues to influence the need for masculinity and strength in men. I felt that Lawrence was explaining how man was taught that he should not have to be kind to a poor stranger (which was the snake), or allow him to have a drink of his water. But, instead of the man treating the poor stranger, or snake, cruelly, he liked him, and allowed him to have a drink of his water. I thought that the man felt like a coward and embarrassed because he did not kill the snake. But, as I read further on into the story, I realized the word use that D. H. Lawrence was using, such as, "Was it perversity, that I longed to talk to him? Was it humility, to feel so honoured?" did not match my assumption for the meaning of the story. Fortunately, I was able to learn the true meaning of the "Snake" in class.

    The true meaning of the "Snake," by D. H. Lawrence, is much ore interesting than my interpretation of the story. I learned that Lawrence, who was a British writer, wrote the short story in the 1920's as a response to the Victorian Period. The story was somewhat of a rebellion against the boring sexual standards of society which he greatly disagreed with. In class, I came to realize that it was ot truly a snake that was bothering the man late at night. The snake is merely a symbol for a phallic, or  the male penis, which was a great surprise to me. In the "Snake," Lawrence was trying to express how people felt guilty when having sex, or even thinking about it. Dr. Crew explained to us how he was "trying to get rid of the separation between sexual life, and real/spiritual life." In the "Snake" Lawrence states, "I thought how paltry, how vulgar, what a mean act! I despised myself and the voices of my accursed human education." After committing his so called sexual crime, the man now feels guilty. From a young age, he has been taught that sex is wrong, and he now feels bad about breaking his "accursed human education."

    I personally enjoyed reading the "Snake," by D. H. Lawrence. From the reading I was finally able to learn what a phallic is, which is a term that I have heard in the past. The story also made me reflect on how I was raised, and the ideas that I have been educated with. Due to the fact that I attended a Roman Catholic grammar school and High School, I can somewhat relate to how the man in the "Snake" felt. Lawrence's story strongly encourages me to continue to try to have my own personal opinion on how life should be lived.

  A Response Poem to the Grecian Sculpture:

For my poem, "Warriors," I somewhat tried to describe the half man half horse
(freak), and then the human. Since I am not a good poetry writer, I mainly
tried to give my reaction and opinion concerning the Grecian sculpture.  
    
    
  

_Warriors_

![](IMG0090s.jpg)

Oh freak of nature  
With weak heart and soul,  
A body broken and bruised  
Not a human, nor a horse.  
Fighting an eternal battle with thyself  
And with mankind,  
Only to gain so little  
And lose so much more.  
Having a need for love,  
But an even greater want for destruction!  


That of mankind,  
Weak in heart and soul.  
A body in loss of breath,  
Yet in a desperate in search of victory.  
Wanting to prove his manhood,  
or is he nothing but a boy in hiding.  
Fighting a battle for self and the human race,  
With no chance of true victory in the future.  


Warriors,  
Living life with a goal to hopefully destroy others,  
Before destruction of self.

  
  
  
  

Week 5

Dear Journal,

    After five long weeks, I feel that I have somewhat gotten the hang of this English 102 class. Although I am always continually somewhat behind in this class, I now have very little, or no, regrets about entering this class. I'm happy that I have learned how to create and edit my own personal web-site/homepage. Even after I have completed this class, I will definitely try to continue editing and adding new features to my web site. I know that in the future, I will benefit from my experience in this class.

 Dirty Sex Poems

     A major topic in class this week was "Dirty Sex Poems." Since a young age, I have always been interested in poetry, and presently, sex poetry is a topic that will always gain my most interest.

     "To His Coy Mistress," by Andrew Marvell, is a one of the sex poems that was focused on in class this week. Since I read the poem in my senior in high school, I was somewhat prepared and aware of the meaning of the sex poem. Although the language in "To His Coy Mistress" was somewhat hard for me to fully understand, I still find the poem to be sexual, and interesting. "She Being Brand New" was another sex poem which was focused on this week. The poem, which was written by E. E. Cummings, is much more modern than Marvell's poem. I found the Cummings' poem to be more humorous and easier to understand than "To His Coy Mistress." Out of all the various sex poems focused on in this weeks class, I enjoyed "She being Brand New" the most. I liked the way Cummings compared a brand new car, to a virgin girl. Although some people may find his comparison offensive or dirty, I found it interesting.

     When dealing with dirty sex poems this week, I was not only assigned to read and analyze various dirty sexual poems, but also to choose one that I find offensive. When doing this assignment, I used various search engines and found numerous sex poems, none of which I found dirty, or offensive. Due to the fact that I felt that all sex poems do not offend me, and some are just more graphic than others, I came to the conclusion that I would use a sex poem that I know many people would find offensive. Therefore, I chose a song from the group Silk, which is one of my favorite R and B artists. Since a majority of there album full of dirty sex songs, I randomly chose "Let's Make Love." So far, out of all the projects that I have done this semester in English 102, I found this one interesting, and not as difficult.   


Week 6

02/22/2000

    Dear Journal,

"Envoys," by Corrina Wycoff is a story about the fear of time, separation, and
society. In the short story, she describes how two life long close
friends/lovers have unfortunately grown apart. She explains how the two are
somewhat forced to continually go their separate ways.

    In "Envoys," Wycoff explains the thoughts of a woman in fear of the how her and her friend are slowly growing apart. The woman, who seems to be older, realizes the fact that time waits for no man. It seems as if the woman rarely ever sees her dear friend, so they "went to the quarry so she could swim and talk about her former lovers." The quarry is their lifelong personal place,  where they could talk about their new life, show their true feelings for each other, or choose to sit in silence and reminisce together. The woman only wishes that time could come to a standstill so that they could spend more time together, but she realizes how her friend "wore no wristwatch," yet she turned the hands of her own watch back half an hour. The calm friend does not express any feelings of sadness or worry. When she is questioned about her life and their friendship, she reacts negatively with great anger that is shown in the cornea of her eyes, which are the cats hissing. The nervous woman does not like how her friend has changed her personality. She dreams that she could be have the same character that she initially had when they first met "on the day of the winter's first snow." Even though she realizes that her friend is somewhat now inferior to her, she will continue to wait for her true personality to return, "and for her skin to grow warm." As she waits for her train, she reminisces on their past, and how they were always together, side by side, arm and arm, as her "friends hung from her sleeves." She acknowledges the fact that time brings growth, and they can no longer be together all the time. She feels that "it is always less expensive to get to her than it is to leave" because it is so much easier to say hello to a friend, than good-bye. The two woman both seem to be deeply in love with each other. They have both continuously rejected each others relationships and mates, only because they were jealous. They seem as if their desperately want to be together, but fear public reaction. The visiting friend believes that it is "pure to love a girl," and she wants them to be able to express their affection and feelings for each other in public. On the other hand, her friend cannot even look in the face as they wait for the train. Her sadness increases as she watches the other "waiting passengers ... hugging and kissing those who waited with them," but her friend only continues to hum "and still does not look at [her]." The sad friend feels that she deserves a kiss good-bye, but the eyes, or "cats", of the woman "cautioned" her that she will not show public affection. As the train comes she realizes that she must be strong enough, and have the courage to fight the reaction of others, and the ignore the eyes of her friend. In her moment of courage, her "bones do not protest." Before entering the train, she then gives her friend, or lover, a passionate  good-bye kiss to take with her. Because of the kiss, she "then knows that [she] can be with her always now."

    Corrina Wycoff short story, "Envoys," depicts how some people fear living life to the fullest. She shows how time and society are able to influence our true thoughts and actions.  In a sad and secretive way, Wycoff explains how the friends, or lovers, continue to wish for a life that they are so capable of having.

My Opening Paragraph of "Envoys"

    As she does not have the courage to look at me, I only wish for her to see the my cat eyes light up like a flame of love. We stand together, only holding hands, as we wait for the her train. As we share our final moments together, we believe that the train will take her home, but I know that her home is truly here with me, because I am where her heart is. She only continues to look at her watch, almost impatiently waiting for her departure from me.

    I feel that this paragraph shows how the visitor and friend have now switched roles. The visitor does not have the courage to look her friend in the eyes. The speaker, who is now the other woman, desperately wants them to be together. She knows that "home is where that heart is," and she wants her friend to stay with her. The visitor now fears the their love for each other, and the public reaction. She is running away from what she wants, and needs in her life.   


Week 7

03/04/2000

Dear Journal,

     I am now almost half way through English 102, and half way through with my first year in college. Although I have to admit that  I personally feel that I could have done much better this year, I know that I still have somewhat of a chance to improve because the year is not yet completely finished.

     As for this English 102 class, I still feel that I am usually somewhat behind in class. When the time comes that I surprisingly do get caught up with the class syllabus, I end up having to face an assignment that I completely do not understand, such as composition #2. Composition 2 (which is an assignment that presently has 50% chance of being completed late) is a project that continues to cause a lot of confusion and stress when I even attempt to work on it. Although I do enjoy this class, and have to admit that  have learned a lot, I still feel that I will probably never be capable to write a correct prospectus.

     As I try to stay strong, and balance my job, and school work, I always look to see what the coming future holds. As I look at the schedule of assignments for English, I notice some good things, and also some bad things. I am happy to see that we will soon start doing much more reading and listening on the computer, and less analyzing and research assignments. But I am sad to see that the type of reading we will be doing is literature such as "Hamlet" which I have always found interesting, but extremely confusing, especially when I read it alone. Since I previously read Hamlet my senior year in high school, I will hopefully try to refresh my terrible memory, and remember the interpretation, and meaning of the acts in the story.

     I know that this week I will have to try my best to stay focused on school work, which is very hard to do living on campus. Along with my completion of composition #2, I will have to concentrate on my Tuesday Biology lab exam, and my music and Human Sexuality exams on thursday, and also continue to go to work in between all the studying. As I go through this week trying not to pull all of my hair out, I will stay calm only because I know that soon I will have a time of freedom. I will be patience as I count the days until this time period freedom arrives. Although I call the 7 days freedom, it is well know as "Spring Break," which equals friends, fun, and 8 hours of sleep daily. Even though I will definitely try put schoolwork at the end of my daily list of things to do, I will definitely try to use a small part of the break to make an effort to try to catch up in my work for all of my classes, especially this English 102 class.   


Week 8

03/12/00

Dear Journal,

    As time goes buy in English 102, I suddenly find myself slowly falling even more behind that I expected to. Luckily, this weeks assignment was somewhat easy, and less stressful compared to the previous english assignments.

    The two major assignments this week were to read "The Tell-Tale Heart," by Edgar Allen Poe, and "Old Mother Savage," by Guy Du Maupassant.  Although the assignment of reading "The Tell-Tale Heart" required me to do some analyzing of the story, I still enjoyed doing it. Out of all the stories that I have read throughout this confusing semester of English 102, "The Tell-Tale Heart" is one that I sit down relax, and enjoy reading. Since I have previously read the story before in my high school AP English class, I was prepared and aware of the topic and strange contents of the story. I have to admit that I am more of a watcher that a reader; therefore, I am able to recognize and acknowledge very few, if any, well known authors or writers. But, Edgar Allen Poe, is one name in writer that I am aware of. Unlike many readings, his stories are the only ones that interest me and that I may take time out to read. Overall, I enjoyed, and most importantly relaxed during this specific English assignment.

    "Old Mother Savage," is new story to me which I have never heard of before. Even though I am not interested in reading, Guy Du Maupassant is a name that did not ring a bell in my memory of English. Because of the title and the somewhat long  length of the story, I was not to anxious to read it, but I knew I had to.

Week9

    03/26/00

Dear Journal,

    This week in English 102 contained both positive and negative experiences. The positive thing was that we have now started reading Hamlet, by William Shakespeare. Luckily, I have previously read the story in the past and also watched the movie, therefore I have some memory of the theme and concept of the story. The negative side was that I got my evaluation for my present work in English 102, which was not what I expected.

    Even though I find the story to be somewhat confusing, I do have to admit that I always enjoy reading it. It seems as if overtime I read "Hamlet," I notice something, or find out something new, that I did not realize before. Sometimes the type of language used in the play confuses me because I am not familiar with the words, but at other times the meaning of the unfamiliar words are obvious. Luckily, I went to a Roman Catholic school for a majority of my life, therefore, I am somewhat able to understand most of the writing in the play. So far, we only had to read act 1 and 2, which is where the story is just warming up. The excitement doesn't really happen until act 3\. One important thing that I can not remember about the story, even though I have read it before, is the ending. I know that I have a bad memory, but I cannot seem to remember if Hamlet killing King Claudius, I only remember him killing Lord Polonius somewhat by accident. Since I can't remember this, I could even see myself going ahead in the readings for once.

    This week, I am also happy about the fact that the assignments are mainly reading. I am far enough behind in publishing and analyzing many other past stories in English 102. So this week I get to relax and just read a story that I find interesting; without having to worry about writing about it or analyzing it (knock on wood :->).

    In my life, for every good side of the story, there is also a bad. The bad side this week was the my evaluation for English 102. I thought that my work was good, but I guess not. After trying to work hard and putting the very little spare time that I have after work and school to go searching to find a computer with Netscape, I ended up with nothing but an even bigger headache. Even if I do bad in this class, at least I know that I tried my best and I also got a chance to learn something about computers. Unfortunately I am not a reader nor a writer, but in the next month or so of this class, I will try my best to be one.   


Week 10

04/01/00

Dear Journal,

    In class, we have now finally finished reading Hamlet. After reading the play, I have noticed some new things about the play, and also remembered some aspects and scenes which I forgot about. Like I assumed, we will be have a quiz/test on the entire story when we next meet.

    As I mentioned before, I think that reading Hamlet was one of the best assignments that we have had this year. It was not only interesting, but we also had a sufficient amount of time to read it. Although I wished that after completing the story, we would be able to discuss it in class, but unfortunately we did not. I understand that the assignment was so easy/comfortable, that many students did not feel motivated or obligated to  read it, therefore we were not able to discuss it. Due to the fact that we could not hold a discussion because a majority of the class did not read it, I somewhat knew that the right thing for him to do would be to assign some type of assignment or quiz based on the reading.

    When Dr. Crew told us that he will be giving a quiz, I was happy yet also nervous. I was happy because I stayed up late reading Hamlet, and trying to understand the difficult language, while many other students probably never even looked at the classic play. I thought that a quiz would be a fare way to show how some people try to do their work, and others could care less. I assumed that the quiz would be given to us written, therefore we would use pen and paper. The fact that we would be stepping away from the computer and being tested on an actual assignment would give me a chance to prove that I truthfully try to do my English work. I was nervous because although I like Hamlet, it is still a hard play for me to read due to the type of language used in it. Since we did not fully go over the entire play in class, I knew that I was in for a hard time. It is obvious that any assignment from Dr. Crew, especially a quiz, will be a challenge. When it I I am giving a certain amount of time to write a large amount, I usually never finish, and if I do, I always know that I could have done better if  I just had twenty more minutes.

    In conclusion, my plans and goals for this weekend are to go to the village in New York, study for music my music quiz on tuesday, reread Hamlet for the quiz also on Tuesday, and start my Human Sexuality and English Composition 3 papers. In about five more weeks, my nightmare  will come to an end :-).

Week 11

04/08/00

Dear Journal,

    I got my English Hamlet quiz back. I guess I got a decent, or good grade compared to some other people, but I am still not happy with my 80. Compared to the previous assignments, quizzes and test that I have taken this semester, I think that my 80 in English 102 just might end up being my highest grade :-(.

    In my opinion, Hamlet is a story that will be taught in many English and literature classes for years to come. The tragic play has been drilled in my head for the past three years, and has now hopefully come to an end as being a part of my life. The day of the test, I walked into the room so prepared and confident about knowing the play inside and out, but I guess I was wrong. It is not that I thought I received a bad grade, it is just that I know that on a topic like Hamlet, I could have done better. Although some of the quotes and questions on the test, were so specific, and confusing, I think that overall, the test was graded and presented fairly for me and my fellow students. I was happy that we reviewed the tests when they were returned to us. Since Dr. Crew noticed that a lot of the people that failed, or did very poorly, on the test are the same people that are doing quite well on the computer assignment; he will hopefully take that into consideration when trying to assign grades fairly. I will now look on the bright side and think how things could be so much worse.

    Another thing that I was happy about this week is the English assignment. I think that it is almost every teenagers/students wish to have a school assignment that requires you to watch television. When I heard that we had to watch a television comedy, I knew that it was to good to be true. After I read the assignment, I realized that we also had to write an essay on the comedy show that we choose to watch. I guess having to watch television and write about it isn't too bad, besides things could always be worse.

    Since I have nothing else to write about English or Hamlet, I will now talk/write about my trip to the NY Village. I didn't only make this trip because I personally wanted to, but also because it was a requirement for my Human Sexuality paper. I went on Saturday night, around 10:00 pm, took the train to New York and met up with my sister who lives in Harlem.  She showed me around the Village and Christopher Street, which was nothing like I had imagined. Unlike I assumed, the majority of people and couples there were middle and upper class Caucasian gay males. I thought that I was going to see a whole bunch of gothic looking gay couples, or lesbians showing public affection, but I was wrong. Now that I think about it, the very few lesbian couples which I saw were young black females. I think that the best part was the many different sex shops that I went into, even though I'm underage. Although though there were signs on each and every store door saying that customers had to be age 21 and over to enter, the owner/workers didn't care how old I was and still helped me look around. After all the different toys and devices that I saw, now I know why some people don't mind being single. I had so much fun at the Village that I plan to return there another day, and maybe next time I just might by something.   
    


Week  12

04/15/00

Dear Journal,

      I now know feel that I am just about lost in this English 102 class. The year is coming slowly to and end, and I have so much to do, but so little time

    When I first started this English class, although it seemed hard, which it is, I chose to stick with it. I definitely do not regret my decision to stay in this class because I know that I tried. There is just about one week left, and about three weeks amount of work left for me today. I sit and wonder if it is humanly possible for me not to sleep for the next 4 days so that I could attempt to complete all of my assignments. I also wonder what my possible grade will be in this class since we had our evaluation a while ago, and have also only taken one quiz.

    Sometimes, when I am doing an assignment I reach a long stage of writers block, I often look at others people English work pages to see if I am the only one trailing behind. When I look at my fellow classmates work, I realize that there are a few right beside me, very little that are doing worse, and the others have almost finished the race. If I only had Netscape, or even a computer in my room at that, I probably could've done better, but it's to late now; the class will soon come to an end.

    Since I don't feel like complaining about how bad I think I doing in English, and just about every other class that I am taking this semester, I will now talk about my birthday. My day of born was this past Tuesday, April 11, also know as 4-11. On that day I had four classes, including this one, which didn't leave me to much time to celebrate it. I did get some two flowers (from family members) delivered to my dorm room, which made me feel special. The night of my birthday, me and my first went to the movie theaters, but it was closed by the time we got there :-(, so we all went and did things that a bunch of college kids do when they bored. The age of nineteen does not really call for a big celebration anyway, compared to things such as sweet sixteen, and driving at age 17, or even turning 21\. But what is can I possibly do at age 19 anyway. In order for me to be able to get into clubs, ladies have to be either 18 and over, or 21 and over.  I still can not drink for another three years, not that I even want to drink anyway. Now, it is going to take me a week to get used to telling people that I am 19, and not 18. Hopefully this increase in my age will encourage me to finally go and get my driver's license, although it is quite comfortable sitting on the passenger side of a car. I personally think that age 19 is just a warning that I am getting closer to adulthood.  But I look at the bright side and thank God that I am finally 19 years old.

Dear Journal,

    This weeks assignment on Rufus Wainwright was one that I surprisingly enjoyed doing. We did not only have to do some research on his music, but also our personal music choices also. When I first read the assignment, I thought that it would be really hard and time consuming, but fortunately, I was wrong.

    Rufus Wainwright is a name that I have never previously heard before in my life. To find some information on him and his music, I used the search engines "Yahoo," and "Lycos." To my surprise, the search results that came up were more that what I needed. I started reading some of the articles about him and his life, and found out that he has somewhat been through hell. I found out that he did not only have a rough life, but he is also gay, which could be a hard lifestyle to live these days. I read a couple of the lyrics to his songs and tried to have an open mind. Before reading Wainwright's musical lyrics, I assumed that it would be something that was somewhat confusing or boring. To tell the truth, I started reading them with a negative opinion of dislike, but luckily, my opinion has changed. To my surprise, his music has a lot of deep meaning to it, unlike the many other shallow songs of the world today. Although I found a lot of his musical lyrics to be very interesting, the three songs that I chose which caught my attention the most were, "Foolish Love," "In My Arms," and especially "Imaginary Love." These three songs all effected me emotionally and made me sit and really think about life and love. Most of his songs are his real life stories put into music, which adds more effect to it. I have still not  actually heard any of his music yet, but I plan to in the future so that I could match the rhythm and beat with his poetic lyrics.

    Another positive thing about this assignment was the fact that it was not a one sided look at music. Although Dr. Crew, and other people, may enjoy and listen to the music of Rufus Wainwright, other people may not have shared that the same interest in him. Therefore, in the assignment, we were fortunately able to include  a total of three songs of our choice. When asked to do this, I knew that my girl Eve had to be one of my three choices. Since the songs had to be recent releases, I chose to put my two present favorite songs, "Happily Ever After," by Case, and "Where I Wanna Be," by Donnell Jones. I love just about all of Eve's music, but since my other two choices were already based on a love them, I then decided to choose her song, "Gotta a Man," which is also based on the topic of love and relationships. These songs were a little easier to analyze compared to Rufus Wainwright's music, but I still enjoyed trying to explaining them all equally.   


Week 14

Dear Journal,

    When I first read William Werc's , "The Day That Eulene Tried to Commit Suicide," I did not fully understood the true meaning of the story. After reading the story a second time, believe that Werc is trying to explain how somehow life is always worth living.

    The actual story of "The Day That Eulene Tried to Commit Suicide" is a young boy, named Billy, memory of how he almost lost his friend and role model. Throughout the story, Billy mentions how Ms. Eulene had such a positive influence on his life. She was not just BIlly's maid, or cook, she also did things for him such as teaching him how to write, and how to do arithmetic. The day when Ms. Eulene suddenly handed Billy her suicide note, he feared for the loss of not only his maid, but also his childhood companion. In the story, Billy continually praises Eulene, and explains how she was "lean and smart woman," and not fat, or stern like his mother. I assume that Eulene, who had many scars on her face and neck, must have lived through a very hard life full of struggles. Before she even made her suicide attempt, her drastic decision to take Billy to her home could have caused her to lose her job, and also could have caused he to get into a lot of other trouble. The sick and injured boy , Junior, is another example of how Eulene was living a hard life. She could have possibly been the person in her home educated enough to take care of everyone in her house, then also have to care for Billy, and herself. Actions such as this made Billy gain respect and admiration for Ms. Eulene. the way she treated Billy also made him feel somewhat older, and mature. Fortunately, Eulene did not die from her suicide attempt of consuming DDT. She also realized that Billy and her family highly appreciated and needed her in their lives. She explains ask for God's forgiveness for her actions, and explains how "you don't know how much you like life until you think you will die."

    Overall, I think guess that in "The Day Eulene Tried to Commit Suicide," William Werc is trying to explain how life is a struggle worth living. I personally feel that sometimes suicide is taking the easy way out of situations.   
    


Week 15

_The Final Ordering of My Work for English 102_

    After almost five long months, my, experience in Dr. Crew's English 102 class is finally coming to an end. In this class, I have learned about English, and also about many other things that I could ever imagine. This experience and this class is a college memory that I will probably never forget.

    I will first explain the bad, or my negative views, about my English 102 class. The main thing that I didn't like about this class is the fat that every thing was done by computer. It was so heard for me to get access to a computer when I needed to do certain assignments. At this present time, I know sit in Dana library which will be closing in about 45 minutes, and as usual, I will then I to patiently wait until tomorrow to finish the rest of my work. Another bad thing was how I somehow was doing something wrong and a couple of my pages would often erase, and I would have to do them all over again. The assignment that was most difficult would definitely have to be ["Composition #2,"](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/comp2.html) on "Literary Structures." After completing Composition #2, I still do  not feel that my work was done right, but since there is no immediate grading in this class, I will have to wait until the end of the semester for the grade. Another assignment that I found confusing was the how I had to evaluate the sites for the potential as resources for lovers of [fiction, poetry, and drama](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/sites.html). I did not fully understand what this assignment was acquiring me to do, therefore this is another assignment that I was not 100% sure about. Although there ar a lot of things that I did not like about this class, there are twice as much positive aspects about why experience in English 102.

    One thing that I like the most about this class is the syllabus. On the very first day, Dr. Crew presented us with the entire course [syllabus](http://newark.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/102descS00.html#schedule) which was easy to follow and well organized. The syllabus itself had effected my choice to stay in this English 102 class. Although  have to admit that this English class required more writing in a class that I have ever experienced, about 50% of the work we had to do was our own personal opinions and analization on topics. An assignment that I enjoyed doing was the [music](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/music.html) assignment. Music, is very important part of my life, and somewhat a necessity for me in living. In this assignment, I had a chance to express, my feelings on music I like, and music that I don't like. Another assignment that I enjoyed a lot would definitely be analyzation of  ["Envoys,"](http://www.io.com/~crberry/DuctTape/Archive/23_fic_wycoff.html) by Corrina Wycoff ([journal entry week 6](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/journalS2000.html)). I feel that out of all the short stories that I have read in English 102 this semester, "Envoys' was my favorite. Since I had such a great interest in the the short story, I put a lot of time an effort into writing my analysis of it. When I was told by Dr. crew that we had to keep a [weekly journal](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/journalS2000.html), I was upset at first. After thinking about the journal assignment, I now realize that it was a good way for me, and my fellow classmates, to freely express our opinions on every and any subject. Since I am a terrible typist and writer, the journal was a way for me to somewhat write how I felt and spoke, without using perfect grammar. Out of the four compositions that I have done in English this semester, the most interesting on that I actually 100% enjoyed doing was [composition #4](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/comp4.html). The fact that we had to write about a contemporary community seemed hard at first, but fortunately, it really wasn't. The choice of a community was left for me to decide, therefore I chose the interesting topic of homosexuality. Composition four, was a project that I worked hard on, and also contained my own personal opinions on the subject.

    Overall, my experience in English 102 was positive. Due to the types of writing assignments, I learned not only how to create a home page, but also about [phallic images](http://pegasus.rutgers.edu/~ba59/snake.html) and what a prospectus is. I have gained patience, and lost my hasty and rush full old ways. I have to admit that this experience has definitely improved my weak writing skills.

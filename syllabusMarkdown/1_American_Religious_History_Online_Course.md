![Image of US Map with symbols of several religious
tradtions](religionsUS.gif) German theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer once
remarked that "it has been granted to the Americans less than any other nation
on earth to realize the visible unity of the church of God." What is
religion's role and function for a society as religiously pluralistic as the
United States? Bonhoeffer's striking observation reflects upon American
expressions of the Christian tradition only. Yet a countless variety of other
traditions can be found throughout the United States.

Our survey of religion in America will address this question of pluralism vs.
cultural identity by reference to the historical development of religion in
the U.S. We will begin with a careful examination of Native-American religion
and the European religious traditions transplanted into the sixteenth- and
seventeenth-century American milieu. We will also investigate the development
of traditions indigenous to the North American continent and examine the
underlying American consciousness of "manifest destiny," "sacred space," and
the pervading characterization of Americans as a "chosen people."  
  
**Requirements:**  
Three book review responses (30%) Students will read all books listed below
and respond to a short series of questions that demonstrate the their
familiarity with the primary themes of the books and the students' ability to
assess each book's significance for the study of American religion. The
Hudson-Corrigan text is required reading but is not assigned for review. Since
there are four required books in addition to the Hudson-Corrigan text,
students may select one book that they need not review.

When grading book reviews, the instructor will pay attention to the topical
content of the paper and will also evaluate grammar, spelling, punctuation,
and the rhetorical devices of style and logic. Students may also wish to
consult William Strunk and E.B. White, The Elements of Style. 3rd ed. New
York: Macmillan, 1979. For your convenience, an electronic version of Elements
of Style is available at
[http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html](http://www.bartleby.com/141/index.html).

**Quizzes (30%)** Students complete five of six objective on-line quizzes. If
you elect to take all six quizzes, the instructor will drop the lowest grade.
Quizzes may be taken at any time before the deadline. _However,_ if you fail
to take the quiz by the scheduled deadline, it will no longer be available at
the WebCT site and the student will receive a zero for that quiz.  
  
**Comprehensive Final examination (25%)** will be made available during the
week of April 27-May 3. You may take the exam at any time during the week, but
once you begin you must complete it within 3 hours.

**-OR-**

**Web-Based Term Paper (25%)** Students may opt out of the final examination
by submitting a web project to be published at the [ American Religious
Experience ](http://are.as.wvu.edu)Student Center Site. If you choose this
option, you must inform the instructor by e-mail before March 15. In addition,
students must inform the instructor of the topic of their web project on or
before April 13. Web projects must be submitted on or before April 29.  
  
**Class participation (15%)** Student attendance (even _virtual_ attendence)
and participation is important to the success of any class. Active
participation in the course discussion area will count 15% toward the final
grade. Each student must post _at least_ 25 messages to the course discussion
string before the end of the semester. Messages are evaluated based on content
quality, so they should reflect familiarity with lecture material and/or the
readings. Please note that like many of our students, the instructor work
other full-time jobs. Consequently, response to e-mail queries may be slow at
times. The instructor will respond to e-mails only in the evening and
Saturdays.  
  
**Tardy work** A largely  "asynchronous", seminar-level course, American
Religious History on-line provides students with significant flexibility with
assignment completions. Assingment will be posted and made available for
several days, and students may elect the time most convenient for them to
complete each one within the scheduled time window. Only under the most
rigorous circumstances may a student obtain permission to submit late work.
Such circumstances might include a medical emergency attested to by a medical
doctor or a documentable death in the student's immediate family.

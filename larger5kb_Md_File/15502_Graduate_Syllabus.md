    AIMS OF COURSE  To examine, understand and explain the traditional
    lifeways and prehistory of the Indians of the South, including and
    emphasizing those who lived in Arkansas.
    
    Indians of Arkansas and the Southeast is a "double numbered course" which
    means that there are common elements for undergraduates and graduates but
    graduate students also have some additional responsibilities.  Graduate
    students are expected to attend regular class sessions, take the regular
    hour exams and do a book report.  Graduate students have an additional
    text book Cultural Encounters in the Early South compiled by Jeannie
    Whayne.  The graduate research paper requirement is more substantial than
    for undergraduates.  It is detailed in a separate handout.
    
    RESOURCES FOR CONDUCTING THE COURSE.  The course draws on varied sources
    including reading, lecture, museum exhibits, artifacts brought to class,
    video and audio tapes, slides and films.

    COURSE RESPONSIBILITIES.
    There are three examinations, including a non-comprehensive
    final , each counting 100 points.  In addition there are a book report (30
    points) and a research paper(200 points).  Thus, for graduates there are
    530 points possible in the course.  Grades will be assigned generally on
    the basis of 90% or more for A, 80% for B 70% for C,60% for D and under
    60% for F.  Separate handouts will outline the requirements for the book
    report and research paper.
    
    Please see the undergrad syllabus for TOPICS,  ASSIGNMENTS AND APPROXIMATE
    DATES
    
                                  RESEARCH PAPER INFORMATION
    Fall 1998
    
    Research Paper.  Graduate students in the class are required to do a
    significant research paper on a topic described below.  Each student will:
    
         1. Attend a short meeting for graduate students during the week of
    Aug. 31-Sept. 4
         2. Make a choice of topic by Monday, Sept. 21, and clear it with me
    so there will not be duplication.
         3. After consulting with me and  about relevant references, submit a
    preliminary bibliography and Outline by Oct. 19.
        4. Submit a first draft of the paper to me by November 25 which I will
    critique and return for revision.
         5. Attend special class sessions for 20 minute oral paper
    presentations during the week of Dec. 2-4. 
         6. Submit final paper Dec. 9.                                         
    
         The paper is worth 200 points.  Its length should be from 10 to 20
    pages.  Use professional anthropological journal style (See the journals
    American Anthropologist or American Antiquity for illustrations of the
    style).  Include  an abstract, text reference citations, references cited
    (bibliography), and appropriate maps or other illustrations.
    
    There are three topical options which you may choose from for the paper.
    Each of them provides an opportunity to do original, worthwhile research
    which might lead to a paper at a meeting or a publication.
    
         Option 1. Gender relationships in myth and traditional culture of a
    Southeastern Tribe.  Last spring semester, senior (and now graduate
    student) Lorna Beard wrote a provocative honors thesis ("The Way It Is?
    Patterning Gender Differentiation in Myth) which examined the congruence
    of gender relationships in myth and traditional culture of three Native
    American groups (Caddo, Oglala Sioux, Navajo). She used a structural
    approach.  Students writing papers in option 1 will ask the same questions
    and use the same approach as Lorna with a Southeastern tribe in which
    there is sufficient information and compare and contrast their findings
    and analyses with hers. The southeastern  or Arkansas tribes which may
    have sufficient information include the Choctaw, Chickasaw, Cherokee,
    Creek, Yuchi, Shawnee, Osage, Natchez and perhaps Tunica.  If you are
    interested in this option, read Lorna's thesis, pick a group and let me
    help with the bibliography.
    
         2. Option 2.  Arkansas  Historical Regional Images of Indians,
    prehistory, archeology and anthropology.  Recently, I had a really good
    time writing a paper, Ancient Races of Giants, Moundbuilders, and Hero
    Collectors: Newspaper Accounts of Arkansas  Archeology, 1870-1930, to be
    published in the Dan Morse Festschrift.   In it, I drew on Arkansas
    newspaper accounts  about archeology and prehistory of the 1870-1930  era
    to appraise the usefulness of such data.  Students who did this option
    would take a section of the state, collect all the newspaper data about
    Indians, prehistory, archeology and anthropology and relate it to
    newspaper (and local folk) perspectives of a particular era using my paper
    as a guide,  Logical divisions of the state are; 1) Northeast, the
    Mississippi  Alluvial Valley above Pine Bluff; 2) Southeast, the valley
    below Pine Bluff and part of the coastal plain ; 3) Southwest, including the Ouachita Mountains and the Red River valley;
    4) Central, the Arkansas River valley from Little Rock to Forth Smith; 5)
    Northwest, the western Ozarks;
    and 6) Northcentral, the central and eastern Ozarks. The University
    Library has  complete microfilm sets of all Arkansas newspapers, but with
    a few exceptions they are not indexed, so the research would be hard on
    the eyes.  I have a great hoard of photocopies of articles which would be
    available and useful.  A copy of my Giants paper is in the ANTH Library
    (Main 332) with ANTH 3263 materials.
    
    Option 3. An Appraisal of the Value of the Central States Archeological
    Journal for Arkansas Archeology.  The CSAJ is a journal for and by private
    collectors which has been around for at least 50 years.  Arkansas has been
    the source of many of the pictures and articles throughout the 50 year
    period.  To my knowledge no one has ever attempted the compilation ;of
    Arkansas-related photographs and articles so that would be a task of a
    student doing this option.  Another would be to discuss the usefulness or
    lack of usefulness of such data.  I have thought about doing this from
    time to time but probably never will, so I hope someone will have at it.
    The public library subscribes and I have a long run from the 50's and
    60's.  Local collectors could make their past volumes available also.
    This could be a long paper if all the photographs and articles were
    photocopies and included as an appendix.  It might have potential as a
    thesis.

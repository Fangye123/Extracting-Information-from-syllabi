**DESCRIPTION AND GOALS**  
This graduate colloquium introduces recent historical work on men, women, the
body, and sexuality across the globe and from antiquity to the recent past. As
such a description shows, our common reading cannot address all histories,
regions, cultures, or topics. But because history and many of its allied
disciplines are fundamentally comparative in nature and increasingly concerned
with matters of gender and sex, it may be worthwhile to consider how
contemporary Western historians of various times and places treat these
subjects, and thereby ask what the range and limitations of "gender" as a
category of historical enquiry may be. In short, we'll need to keep asking
"How?," "Why?," and "So what?". Another part of our collective agenda will be
to consider how gender studies are situated within current theoretical debates
among historians. To what extent does gender history draw on the "mode of
production" (Marxist) and "mode of information" (postmodernist) approaches to
the past? How is "gender" like "class" or "race," and how does it intersect
and interact with those categories and their construction? Is there a social
history of sexuality?  

Our tasks are to read, talk, and compare observations in oral and written
form. The attached handout, "Reading Historians," suggests techniques for
analytical reading of historical literature that may be useful as you prepare
for the weekly discussions. To counter the centripetal tendencies of the
syllabus, each participant will undertake a bibliographic survey on a specific
subject of particular interest and present their finding on recent scholarship
in the form of an essay. Although each of us will inevitably come away from
the course with rather different ideas and conclusions about the nature and
value of gender as a historical subject and a category of analysis, we will
have all participated in a common project of reading and discussion of what
are meant to be provocative approaches to understanding gender in its various
historical contexts and relations. .  
**REQUIREMENTS**  
  
  
  * Mastery of weekly readings and readiness to discuss and engage one another about them in our seminar discussions. 
  * Five **VERY SHORT** (200-300 words) papers on some aspect of the week's reading, **to be submitted by noon Tuesday,** the day before our meetings. You should complete two of these in the first three weeks of the term and complete the set by Thanksgiving if not before. 
  * **Supplementary presentation and review essay.** Each member of the colloquium will, at some point in the term, give a ten minute summary of a book other than the common reading for the week to further discussion of the larger subject at hand. A review-essay of 6-8 pages, comparing the two books discussed in a given week, will be distributed to all members of the colloquium **no later than two weeks after oral presentation.**
  * **Final comparative essay of 10-15 pages.** Here you will review and compare the approach, methods, and conclusions of several recent book-length studies on whatever topic within gender studies is of most interest to you. **FIRM due date: Monday, December 23rd.** 
  
**SCHEDULE OF READINGS AND REPORTS**

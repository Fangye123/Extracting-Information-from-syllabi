**OVERVIEW AND OBJECTIVES** : This course reviews the general history of the
West from its beginnings around 3000 bce to approximately 1600 ce and allows
students to reach a basic understanding of the roots and characteristic
features of the West. The course also helps students to develop an
understanding of the academic discipline of history and supports the general
educational goals of historians and the college. Grading in the course is
based on written assignments and on class work that demonstrates critical
thinking. It is expected that students possess college-level writing skills.
It is recommended that students should have already taken (or be taking)
English composition.   **BOOKS** : The text for the course is Perry, _Western
Civilization_ (Volume 1), which comes shrink-wrapped with Rand-McNally,
_Historical Atlas of the World_. There are a number of short paperbacks
required: _Gilgamesh_ ; _Song of Roland_ ; Chaucer, _Canterbury Tales_ and
Machiavelli, _The Prince_. (Any editions are acceptable).   **ONLINE ITEMS** :

## Women and Religion

This course investigates women's religious practices and beliefs in a number
of established religions, focusing on patterns observable in a wide range of
religious traditions, ancient and modern. Religions considered this semester
include Buddhism, Caribbean zar, Christianity, Dionysian devotion (ancient
Greece), Hinduism, Islam, and Judaism. We are concerned both with the
description of women's religions, and with the development of some theoretical
models to help us understand the nature and functions of women's religious
beliefs and practices. We pay special attention to the interaction of religion
and culture, and the ways in which religion helps form women's roles in
different societies. Issues raised will include the impact of the women's
movement and feminist thought on the religious life of women in particular
contemporary societies, and the development of contemporary woman-oriented
spiritual movements and religious practices.

### Course Requirements:

1\. **Attendance at all lectures.** If you are sick, or away from school for
an emergency, please try to let us know in advance if at all possible. You may
send us an e-mail message, or call Professor Kraemer's office, or the
department office (898 7453).

2\. **Attendance and participation in all weekly discussion sections.** See
above regarding absence from section. In addition, each student will be
expected to take responsibility for opening discussion in section at least
once during the semester, normally by preparing a short response to the week's
readings and lecture(s) and making it available to other students sufficiently
in advance of section. E-mail is an efficient way to do this.

2\. **Timely completion of the weekly reading assignments.** Due to the nature
of the material, the readings for some weeks will be heavier than others, so
you should plan accordingly. On average, you should expect to devote 6-8 hours
per week in class preparation and related work.

3\. **Weekly journal.** All students are expected to keep a journal of your
responses to class readings. You may also include responses to lectures,
discussions and videos. Journals may be hand-written or word processed, and
should be done **at least once a week.** Journals must be submitted three
times during the semester. Normally, they should be handed in at section of
the week they are due: **Feb 5; Mar 5; Apr 23.**

4\. **Two short papers/critical book reviews.** Further information will be
available later, but normally one of these will be a critical review of
Margaret Atwood's novel,  The Handmaid's Tale. Papers/projects are due by
section the week of **Feb 16 and March 20.**

5\. **Final papers.** The final paper for the course will be a research paper
on a topic of your own choosing, subject to the approval of your section
leader. Topics and bibliography must be submitted in advance. The due date of
the paper will be announced later in the semester.

### Grading Policies

To receive a passing grade, students are expected to satisfy **all** course
requirements, as described above. Failure to meet **any individual requirement
may** be grounds for receiving a failing grade for the course.

For purposes of determining your final grade, course work will be weighted as
follows:

Weekly journals 30%; Short papers 20%; Final Paper 25%; Attendance and
participation (particularly in section and electronically) 25%. Total: 100%.

Papers are due as noted or announced in class or electronically. Students who
submit papers after the deadlines, without having made prior arrangements,
should expect to be penalized in the grade they receive.

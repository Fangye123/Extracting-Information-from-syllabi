**Course Description**

This CORE course examines the art and architecture of Western Europe and the
United States from the Early Renaissance to the present. The course offers an
introductory survey of a selection of major artistic monuments and invites
students to understand and interpret these monuments in historical and visual
contexts.



**Required Textbooks**

1. Kleiner, Mamiya, and Tansey,

_Gardner's Art Through the Ages_ , **11th edition** , **Volume II**

2. Joshua Taylor, _Learning to Look_ (1957; rev. ed. 1981)

The two textbooks and the course syllabus are available at the University Book
Center; the two texts (but not the syllabus) can also be purchased at the
Maryland Book Exchange.



**Course Requirements:**

1. two mid-term examinations;

2. one 4-6 page (typed, double-spaced) paper (see "Paper Assignment" and  "Questions To Ask," pp. 5-7 of syllabus);

3. final examination;

4. regular attendance at lectures and regular participation in discussion sections  conducted by assigned TA

**Make-Up Exam Policy:** Make-up exams will be scheduled in cases where valid
medical and/or personal reasons for the missed exam can be demonstrated. Only
**ONE** make-up exam (for each of the semester's three tests) will be
administered. You must contact your TA within 48 hours of the originally
scheduled exam to insure your place in the make-up exam.



**Percentage Breakdown of Course Grade:**

Mid-Term #1: 20%

Mid-Term #2: 20%

Paper: 20%

Final Exam: 30%

Participation: 10%



**Testing Procedures/Exam Preparation** :

Mid-Term Exams will be designed and administered by the TAs for their
individual sections. The Final Exam will be designed and administered by the
professor with the assistance of the TAs.



To prepare for the mid-term and final it is critical that you attend lectures
and discussion sections. In the lectures, the professor will discuss and
illustrate works of art; those works that appear in **BOTH** the lectures
**AND** in Gardner will be referred to as  " **KNOWNS** " for examination
purposes. We will, in other words, assume that you **know** them. For the
purposes of course examinations, works of art that appear in **EITHER**
lectures **OR** your textbooks but not in both, **AS WELL AS** works of art
that you have **NEVER** seen in either lectures or your textbooks, will be
referred to as  " **UNKNOWNS**. " All three examinations will require you to
intelligently discuss both KNOWNS and UNKNOWNS.

**FINAL EXAMINATION: Tuesday, December 18, 10:30-12:30, Art/Soc. 2203**

  

  

**EXAM FORMAT--for both Mid-Terms and for Part I of the Final:**



I. **Definitions** (5 at 5 points apiece, 2 min. each); you will be given five
terms, names,  or events and asked to define/describe them.



II. **Slide Identification** (5 at 5 points apiece, 2 min. each); you will be
shown four KNOWNS and one UNKNOWN; you will be asked to identify the KNOWN
slides by providing the following information:

1. name of artist or architect

2. title of the work

3. date of the work

4. stylistic period

5. the country in which the artist worked

The UNKNOWN work will closely resemble some KNOWN work(s); when the UNKNOWN
work is shown, identify it **_by analogy_** to KNOWN works it resembles. You
may actually be able to provide almost as much information as for a KNOWN
slide.



III. **Slide Comparison/Essay** (50 points, maximum of 30 minutes):

You will be shown two slides at the same time. First, identify each slide as
in Part II (above). Then write an essay comparing and contrasting the two
images in terms of their subject matter; form, composition, or visual
characteristics; style; content; historical context; and function.



**EXAM FORMAT--for Part II of the Final:**



The Final Exam will be held in the usual lecture hall on **Tuesday, December
18, from 10:30 to 12:30**. You will need the full two hours. The first hour of
the Final Exam will be identical in format to the two Mid-Terms (see above)
and will constitute 50% of your Final Exam grade. This first part of the Exam
will cover only material presented between the second Mid-Term and the end of
the semester.



Part II of the Final Exam covers the **ENTIRE** semester and will be
constituted by short identification of 25 UNKNOWNS (worth 2 points each). Here
you will be asked to provide for each UNKNOWN not a full identification, but
your best estimate of the following information:

1. stylistic period

2. century

Part II of the Final Exam is worth 50% of the Final Exam grade.





  

**PAPER ASSIGNMENT--VISUAL ANALYSIS--due November 28 in Lecture**



This assignment is about looking and about writing. It depends on your own
visual observations and not on research in the library. You will not need to
consult any book (although you may find Joshua Taylor's _Learning to Look_
helpful).



At the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., select any European or
American painting dated between 1400 and 1996. The painting must be currently
on display and you must work at the Gallery in the presence of the original.
Select a work that you like; spend at least two hours looking at this image.
Then, using the notes you have made of your observations, write a polished
essay. The set of "Questions" below is intended NOT as an outline for your
paper, but as a way to get started; you need not answer every question.
Furthermore, your paper MUST be organized as a formal essay of **_four to six
typed, double-spaced pages_** , and may NOT be presented in outline form.



When you hand in your paper, please include a reproduction of the image (a
postcard is fine); the National Gallery gift store in the West Building sells
inexpensive reproductions of many images in its collection. You may want to
check to make sure they have a reproduction of your image before you begin
working on the project. If you have selected an image for which no
reproduction is available, please check with your TA to make sure that she/he
knows the image or has a reproduction of it her/himself. DO NOT REMOVE IMAGES
FROM BOOKS to hand in with your assignment.

**VISUAL ANALYSIS**

(SOME QUESTIONS TO ASK WHEN LOOKING AT WORKS OF ART)

Adapted, with permission, from Julius S. Held, "Pictures Will Answer if You
Ask Them the Right Questions."



Visual analysis or formal analysis concerns the visual components and
qualities of an image, the material evidence, the issues raised by the object
itself and its material composition. Answering these questions, which deal
with principles of artistic selection, omission, and arrangement, will help
you to analyze how the artist used the formal elements of art to create the
work of art you are considering. (Most of these questions, while they can be
rephrased in relation to three-dimensional objects such as sculpture, are
conceived in relation to painting.)



**Frame and pictorial area:** What is the actual size? Proportion of height to
width (and, in sculpture, depth)? What is the relation of shapes to frame
and/or to space. Harmonious or discordant? Are shapes respected by the frame
or cut by it?



**Technique:** What materials are used for support? Wood, canvas, cardboard,
paper, etc.? What is the medium applied to the support (oil, tempera,
watercolor, pastel, etc.)? How is the paint applied (in strokes or layers?
Spots? Thickly or smoothly? With a fine or coarse brush or otherwise?) Is the
paint transparent or opaque? Other materials? If sculpture, what is the
medium? Additive or subtractive? How does the sculptor handle the medium,
exploit the characteristics of the medium?

**Organization:** Simple or complex? Geometrically ordered or free and
seemingly accidental? Do some forms dominate over others? Is there symmetry or
assymetry? Does the artist organize forms around a central axis? How do the
proportions of the forms relate to each other? Do they seem harmonious or
jarring? If figures are used, does the scale of the figures seem appropriate
in relation to the setting? How are the figures arranged in relation to each
other? Does the organization of forms seem dynamic or static? How is your eye
led into the painting; how is your eye invited to engage the work of art? Is
the organization of forms crowded or spacious? Does variety or repetition
receive more emphasis? Balance? In sculpture, open or closed form?



**Individual units (objects):** Many or few? Large or small (both in relation
to the human world and to the picture area)? What range of sizes? Regular or
irregular shapes? What kind of pattern do the shapes form? What proportion of
solid and "broken up" areas? Emphasis on central or marginal areas? Degree of
ornateness?



**Lines:** Does the artist adopt a "linear" approach, which emphasizes
contours and the edges of things, or a "painterly" approach, which builds up
form with brush strokes and patches? Does the artist emphasize vertical,
horizontal, or diagonal lines? How do the lines of the composition relate to
each other and to the composition as a whole? Do they point out beyond the
frame or are they carefully contained within it? Are they rhythmic or jarring?
Clear or obscured? Subservient or assertive? Angular or curved? If both, in
what proportion or relation? Are there lines at all?



**Colors:** Bright or subdued? High or low saturation? Pure hues or mixed?
Many colors or few? Any one dominant? Warm or cool? Dark or light? Moderate or
extreme contrasts? Large areas or small patches? Repetitions or echoes?



**Light:** Is there a consistent source? Inside or outside the picture, or
both? Strong or muted contrasts? Degree of clarity? Shadow? What is the
function of shadow (clarifying/obscuring form, emphasizing mood, etc.)?



**Space:** Shallow or deep? Open or screened off? Emphasis on solids or voids?
Is three-dimensionality suggested? If so, how is this accomplished (e.g.,
linear perspective, foreshortening, aerial perspective, overlapping, color
dynamics, position on the picture plane, relative size of objects and
intervals between them, modeling, cast shadows)? If linear perspective, where
is the vanishing point? What about the horizon line? If the work is a
sculpture, are you intended to look at it principally from one side or does
the artist want you to walk around it? If the latter, what devices are used to
achieve this effect?



**General observations:** How consistent is the structure of the whole? What
degree of variety or sameness? Does the work seem spontaneous or calculated?
Carefully planned or improvised? What is the viewer's response to the image
and how is that response evoked visually by the artist?



*****Remember that you must be able to justify your conclusions with
observations that can be checked by others. Tell us what you _see_.** Avoid
reading into the image qualities which come from your own attitudes,
convictions, sympathies. In other words, distinguish between the data given
visually and your own associations. Consider alternate choices that the artist
might have made and how they might have affected the character of the work?
Try to notice not only what has been shown, but also what has been omitted.



CONSIDERATIONS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF SUBJECT MATTER



**Portraits:** How much of the figure is shown? How large is it in relation to
the frame? Disposition of form? What kind of background or setting? What kind
of action? Any indication of trade, professions, class, etc.? Relationship
established between spectator and person portrayed? Intimate or aloof? What
visual means does the artist use to create this level of engagement or
disengagement? What kind of clothing? Proportion of figure to face? What
aspects are stressed? How? Exaggerations or deviations from norm?



**Figural scenes:** Quiet or dramatic action? What kind of staging? Does the
staging imply some sort of narrative? Do any visual cues identify the nature
of the narrative? Many figures or few? Small or large in relation to the size
of the picture? Full length or cut? What kind of setting? Indoors or out? What
role does the setting play? Main action stressed or obscured?



**Landscape:** Proportion of earth to sky, water to land, plain to elevation,
etc.? Is a large area or a small area visible? Degree of human involvement in
the landscape? What is the general character (calm, stormy, forbidding,
intimate, monumental, attractive, etc.)? What elements determine this impact,
in other words, how does the artist arrange the painting in order to induce
this response?

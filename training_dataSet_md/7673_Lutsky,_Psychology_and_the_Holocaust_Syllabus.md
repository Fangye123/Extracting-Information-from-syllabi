**Organization and Requirements:**

The seminar will examine the Holocaust and its relationship to the broad field
of psychology. What roles did social scientific thinking, psychology, and
psychologists play in the Holocaust? What does psychology contribute to our
understanding of the Holocaust, of the behaviors and experiences of victims
and perpetrators of evil? How has psychology tried to make sense of the
Holocaust, and how has psychology been influenced by the Holocaust? What are
our obligations as citizens of the world in which the Holocaust and other acts
of genocide have occurred?

This seminar is a group and interdisciplinary effort. I expect that each of us
will take responsibility for the conduct of each class meeting. Please read
carefully, consider topics and readings seriously before class, identify and
develop questions for class discussion, and participate in class discussion
actively, thoughtfully, and critically. Each seminar participant will be
especially responsible for shepherding one class discussion during the term,
and he or she will be expected to do some additional reading on the topic of
the day. Please meet with the instructor prior to the class to discuss your
session. Everyone in the class will also be expected to read parts of one of
the works listed for January 31 on "Clinical and Other Studies of
Perpetrators." Finally, the course will require a major paper on a topic
related to Psychology and the Holocaust. This paper will be due Monday, March
7, at 11:30AM. We will discuss these papers during the week of March 7. Your
final grade will be based on the quality of your class contributions, your
discussion leadership, and your final paper.

Please remember that I would value talking with you about course-related
issues outside of class time and invite you to stop by my office to do so.

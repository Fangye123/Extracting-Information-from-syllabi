### **THE EXPANSION OF INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY**

This is the required, introductory, sophomore-level course for the major in
International Studies.(1) It has two main objectives: (1) International
Studies majors (and other students) will acquire a common basis of knowledge
about the evolution of our modern world system, as some prefer to call it, or
our contemporary international society, as this course labels it. No one-
semester course can cover all aspects of the evolution of our international
society; this course chooses as its subject the relations between the imperial
powers and the peoples they colonized from the sixteenth century to the
present, emphasizing particularly the wave of Spanish colonization,
nineteenth-century colonization, and twentieth-century reactions by the
colonized peoples to imperialism. The economic, political, and cultural forces
that propelled European imperialism will be explored as will the cultural,
religious, social, political, and economic consequences of imperialism.
Considerable attention will be paid to the emerging international society of
the twenty-first century. Alternative disciplinary approaches and alternative
social science paradigms that consider these issues will be assessed. (2)
Students will focus on the country or region in which they plan to study for
their junior semester or year abroad, thereby gaining specific knowledge of
that country or region before going there to study. This focus will be
acquired through a research paper, the major assignment for the course. Those
who have already studied abroad or will not have the opportunity to do so will
also be able to learn more about one other country or region through this
assignment.

* * *

**Requirements**. A  [ **research
paper**](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/PSci/Inst21/PAPER_How_to_Write.htm) of
about fifteen pages in length is the most important writing assignment in this
course. It will count as 30 percent of the final grade and will be due on
April 25. The objectives of the research paper are twofold: (1) to allow
students to learn something in detail about the country in which they will
study next year (or might wish to study at another time, for those who will
not be studying abroad next year), and (2) to help students learn how to
acquire information about other countries and international affairs generally
in the library, especially in light of the explosion of electronic sources of
information in recent years. In fact, we will pay special attention to
studying ****[**resources**](researchexercises.htm) produced in a variety of
media that reflect the interdisciplinary and international goals of the
course. ([INST 201 library resource guides](../instinfo/infoinst.html))

Therefore, there will be a series of [**research
exercises**](researchexercises.htm) and a [ **final
examination**](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Psci/Inst21/final.htm). The
research exercises will be worth 20 percent of the grade and the final will be
worth 30 percent. The final is scheduled for **Saturday** , **May 11 at 1:30
p.m**. Consider this date when you make your travel plans, so that there is no
problem at the end of the semester

There will also be a [ **map
project**](http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/PSci/Inst21/map_assignment.htm) for
the course to help acquaint you with world geography. You will be provided
blank continent maps for your area of concentration. With these you will
produce a contemporary map and a historical map. The elements mapped need not
be political boundaries, but might be some other crucial aspect of the
societies, cultures, demographies, or economies of the continent in question.
Thus, you are being encouraged to be creative in the making of your maps. You
will produce a two-page description of the changes being illustrated between
the historical and the contemporary map. This will be due February 23. The map
project will be worth 10 percent of the grade.

Finally, **class participation** will be worth 10 percent of the final grade.
Class participation will involve attendance and participation during class
sessions. Generally, we will reserve Fridays for class discussion. Our
discussion will focus on the books assigned for the course, the videos
presented, and short documents, some of which are printed in the main textbook
for the course, others of which will be handed out to the class or made
available on the course website.

* * *

**Summary of final grade components:** Research Paper  | 30% |  
---|---|---  
Research Exercises  | 20 % |  
Final Exam  | 30 % |  
Map Project | 10 % |  
Participation | 10 % |  
**Total** | **100 %** |  
Separate documents will be distributed and made available on the website which
describe the process of writing research papers and bibliographic sources
available in the Kenyon libraries which should be used in writing research
papers. The books assigned for the course are available at the Kenyon College
Bookstore. Most will also be on reserve in Olin Library.

* * *

**A note on the agenda**. This course will rely extensively on videos, both
documentaries and feature films. In order to make sure that we are able to
discuss those videos adequately, I have scheduled one class period per week
(usually Friday) which will be devoted to discussion of the video of the week,
to the documents I mentioned above, and perhaps to another reading. The videos
will be scheduled for a time outside of the regularly scheduled class period.
We will jointly determine times for watching these videos during the first or
second class session.

This course is labeled a lecture course, which means a lecture-and-discussion
course. Discussion is always welcome. It will frequently be expected as an
integral part of a class session even if that class session is not labeled a
discussion. Please come prepared by having read the assigned material.
However, please be aware that frequent interruptions of lectures can be
disruptive for your fellow students and that part of a good discussion
involves allowing other students to participate too.

This class will be conducted by means of web-based projections of the class
outline or questions for discussion, illustrations, and many other materials,
including some of the reading assignments. The links will operate through this
syllabus. It is available at
http://www2.kenyon.edu/depts/psci/inst21/syllabus.htm. The syllabus will fill
up with web links as the semester progresses. Please let me know if and when
this technology becomes dysfunctional for your learning in the course.

* * *

**Three Important Announcements**

First, if you have a disability and therefore may have need of some type of
accommodation(s) in order to participate fully in this class, please feel free
to discuss your concerns in private with me and also self identify yourself to
Erin Salva, Coordinator of Disability Services, at PBX 5453 or via e-mail at
[salvae@kenyon.edu](mailto:salvae@kenyon.edu).

Second, The Kenyon College _Course of Study_ has defined plagiarism in this
way:

Learning from another artist or scholar is commendable, but to use the ideas
(written, oral, graphic or artistic) or the phraseology of another person
covertly, so as to represent the material as one's own, constitutes
plagiarism.

The [_Course of
Study_](http://circle.kenyon.edu/academics/cos/2000-01/administrative/027.phtml)
has an extensive discussion of academic honesty which you are responsible for
reading and understanding. If you have any questions, you should feel free to
ask your instructor or members of the Academic Infractions Board. Different
disciplines have different needs and accepted methods of referencing, and
faculty can help you determine what is proper, but it is the student's
responsibility to be aware of Kenyon's policy on academic dishonesty.

Third, my office hours for the semester are 9:30-12:00 on Mondays and
Wednesdays. If you need to reach me by e-mail

The International Relations Concentration is an interdisciplinary program for
undergraduate students enrolled in any of the seven Cornell undergraduate
colleges. It provides a structured yet flexible program for undergraduates to
take advantage of the vast resources available at the university for studying
the politics, economics, history, languages, and cultures of the countries and
regions of the world.

Graduates of the program have gone on to pursue further education in fields
such as political science and anthropology and to successful careers in
international law, economics, agriculture, trade, finance, and government
service. They have worked in international and nongovernmental organizations,
in cross-cultural affairs, in journalism, and in education.

The IR Concentration is not a major or a department, but rather a program
offering a selection of courses reaching across colleges and departments.
Students pursue the Concentration in addition to their regular degree.
Concentrators have majored in such fields as anthropology, city and regional
planning, communications, government, history, natural resources, industrial
and labor relations, and computer science. International coursework and
language study add a global and cross-cultural dimension to those majors. Some
students even design an independent major in some aspect of international
relations or comparative social or cultural studies. Spending a semester or
year of study abroad can contribute to meeting the course requirements of the
IR Concentration, including the language requirement.

**Course Requirements**

These requirements are designed to expose students to a broad range of
perspectives in international relations while allowing them to tailor their
course selections to specific interests.

Courses throughout the university are grouped into four subject areas:

  * International Economics and Development 
  * World Politics and Foreign Policy 
  * Transnational Processes and Policies 
  * Cultural Studies 

Courses within these four subject areas are designated as "core" or
"elective." Students must complete eight courses selected from the four groups
according to one of two strategies.

> **Option A** emphasizes the politics and economics of international
relations.

>

>   * One core course from each group  
>

>   * One elective from each group

>

> **Option B** puts greater stress on culture.

>

>   * One core course from each group  
>

>   * One elective from either Group 1 or Group 2  
>

>   * One elective from Group 3, one elective from Group 4, and one additional
elective from either Group 3 or Group 4

>

In choosing either option, students should ensure that they acquire
familiarity with more than one geographic region or country.

All courses used to fulfill the concentration requirements, including language
courses, must be taken for a letter grade.

**Language Requirements**

IR Concentrators are expected to complete additional language study beyond the
College of Arts and Sciences degree requirement of "proficiency." For most
languages, proficiency is attained by completing a course at the 200 level, by
which point the basic grammar and structure of the language will have been
covered.

The requirement can be fulfilled in one of two ways:

  * Demonstrated proficiency in two foreign languages, or
  * Demonstrated facility in one foreign language (proficiency plus one course that uses the language to explore some aspect of a foreign culture, such as literature or film)

All language courses must be taken for a letter grade.

**Study Abroad**

IR Concentrators are strongly encouraged to study abroad to bring a practical
dimension to their expertise in international issues. Those who choose this
option will find the requirements for the concentration highly compatible with
courses taken abroad. To learn more about programs available for study abroad,
consult [Cornell Abroad](http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/CUAbroad), and contact
the Administrative Coordinator of the IR Concentration to discuss how your
study abroad program can help fulfill the concentration requirements.

**Enrollment**

Students may enroll in the International Relations Concentration at any point
but are encouraged to do so early in order to be put on the email list for
announcements of news and activities of the program. There is no penalty for
withdrawing from or not completing the Concentration. To enroll, please
contact the Administrative Coordinator.

**Completion**

Transcripts reflect successful completion of the requirements for the
Concentration. In addition, students receive a certificate and a letter of
confirmation signed by the Director of the International Relations
Concentration and the Director of the Mario Einaudi Center.

**Advisory Committee**

Students are welcome to consult with members of the advisory committee to help
shape their programs, get advice on particular courses, and learn of
opportunities for study and internships abroad.

**Course List**

The course list includes all of the core courses for each group, whether they
are offered during the current semester or not. [Courses enclosed in brackets
are not offered during the current semester.] The electives list, which is
regularly updated, is intended to be representative but not exhaustive so
includes only those courses offered during the current semester. Please note
that some courses, especially in Group 1, have prerequisites and others have
limited enrollment.

Be aware that these course lists may not be complete. If you are interested in
a course that is not on this list but which you believe has substantial
content relevant to the IR Concentration, please make an appointment to see
the Administrative Coordinator and bring along the course description and the
syllabus, if possible. Although a single course may be listed under more than
one group, it can only be counted once toward fulfillment of the Concentration
requirements.

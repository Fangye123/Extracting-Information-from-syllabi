**COURSE DESCRIPTION** :  This course examines the major theoretical paradigms
within academic archaeology and the tenets upon which they are based.  Course
content emphasizes 20th century developments in American archaeology,
especially its shifting and sometimes tenuous relationships with anthropology.
Readings are chosen from the older, seminal writings as well as more current
essays on theory. This literature is approached in both topical and
chronological order to assess the major theoretical developments in their
historical context and to comprehend how ideas emerged in relation to existing
or earlier issues.  
 The emphasis is placed more on the key constructs and problems in archaeology
as a social and historical science, and less on specific "schools" of thought.
Nevertheless, there have been major disagreements--even schisms--in
archaeology, some of which still exist.  The literature we read may seem like
endless bickering about old ideas; yet, there is a constancy of underlying
themes as archaeologists struggle to define and validate what they do.  The
resulting dialectic is referred to in different ways--as "history vs.
anthropology," "general vs. specific," "science vs. interpretation,"
"objectivity vs. subjectivity," and also "theory vs. practice."    These
debates and disagreements demonstrate archaeologists' abiding concern to
grapple with the intellectual foundations of their discipline.  Despite the
return of old questions and concerns thought to have been put to rest long
ago, archaeology has--precisely through this process of debate--developed in a
productive way as a discipline, and continues to strive towards its basic
objective: to increase our cumulative knowledge of humanity's past--especially
the global diversity of societal configurations and the transformations they
underwent over time--and thus our knowledge of ourselves.

**COURSE DESIGN** :  This course has been designed for advanced undergraduate
Anthropology majors, especially those with a keen interest in archaeology
and/or in the epistemological issues of anthropology.  Students in History and
Classics may also find this course of interest.  Students with a strong
background in archaeological methods and techniques, as well as the prehistory
of at least one major world area, will be better prepared to deal with the
abstract nature of the contents of this course than will students without this
background.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES AND STUDENT GOALS** :  Students are expected to gain a
strong foundation in the major social science concepts and problems upon which
anthropological archaeology is based, relating empirical research to
underlying abstract ideas and attitudes.  They should become familiar with the
history of American academic archaeology, specifically: the different
perspectives and approaches to the past that have waxed and waned in
popularity during the 20th century, the tenets upon which these perspectives
are based, and the strengths and limitations that they pose.  They should
learn how to critique theories and their applications to data, and reflect on
how knowledge of the past has been constructed and interpreted.

**REQUIRED READINGS** :   No textbook or reader adequately covers all the
topics examined in this course.  Thus, required readings are drawn from
journal articles, chapters in anthologies, or excerpted from longer books.
They have been organized into a single course packet, available for purchase
at Custom Copies, 309 NW 13th St (across from Krispy Kreme).  Assigned
readings for each class meeting are given in the course outline that follows.
It is important to read the assignments before that class, in order to follow
the lecture and participate in any discussion.

Take notes on every reading and bring the notes to class.  For example:

>   What is the author's main point(s)?  
>   What are the key concepts?  How are key words defined?  
>   What are the author's assumptions, both explicit and implicit?  
>   How does this author criticize other authors' works?  
>   How does this author propose to overcome those alleged shortcomings?  
>   With what other readings would you align this work?  
>   To what other readings does this author seem to be opposed?

Handouts and other assignments are also considered required readings.  Bring
your readings to class.

**COURSE FORMAT** :  IMPORTANT: This course combines lectures with group and
class discussions!  Specific portions of class time are set aside for
discussions and written assignments in which everyone is expected to
participate and to be prepared.  Even during the lectures, students are
expected to ask/answer questions about the material.  You cannot simply sit
back and be passive; you must actively participate.  You are being asked to
think and reflect on complex and abstract concepts, and to apply them
yourself.

**CLASS PARTICIPATION AND ATTENDANCE POLICY** :   Because the course is
designed around lectures and in-class discussions of rather complex readings,
missing class will prove deterimental to your understanding of that material
and ultimately to your final grade.   If you must miss class, it is YOUR
responsibility to obtain the lecture notes from a classmate. Attendance is
taken every class period, and together with class participation (discussion
and written exercises) counts towards 10% of the final grade.  Only
involuntary absences will be excused, and documentation must be presented to
support your request for an excused abasence.  Failure to be prepared for the
discussion is not much different from being absent and will also be noted.

**PANEL PRESENTATIONS** :  Special topics that cut across the shifting
theoretical paradigms are explored in the latter half of the semester, with
discussion led by a panel. Panel members will research their assigned topic,
prepare a joint annotated bibliography for distribution to the class, give a
brief presentation or lead a discussion on that topic, and prepare a short
reflective essay.  Potential topics include the culture concept, evolution,
forms of  explanation, style, the social contexts of archaeological theory,
and the relationships between academic and applied archaeology.  Work on the
panel constitutes 10% of the final grade.

**EXAMS** :  Your grade in this class is based primarily on your mastery of
the course material as demonstrated on the exams, which cover lectures and
readings. Two in-class midterms and a cumulative final exam will be
administered.   They consist of short- and long-answer essays.  The two
midterms are each worth 25% of the final grade, and the final is worth 30%,
for a total of 80%.  Missed Exams may be made up ONLY if you have a valid
excuse for an involuntary absence during the scheduled exam period AND if you
(or someone on your behalf) has informed the professor before the exam begins
that you have a valid excuse.  Missed exams should be made up within one week
of the original exam period at the instructor's convenience.

**GRADES** :  All grades in this course are earned, not negotiated. Grading is
based on mastery of the course material as determined from the performance on
the exams(80%), plus class participation and panel presentations (total 20%).
Letter grades are assigned only at the end of the semester, according to the
following scale: 90-100% = A (minimally 270 out of 300 points), 80-89% = B
(240-269 points), 70-79% = C (210-239 points), 60=69% = D (180 points needed
to pass).  There is no "extra" credit.   Federal privacy regulations prevent
the release of scores and grades over the phone or by email.  Please do not
ask for your test scores or letter grades by these means.  If you want to know
your final grade early, give a stamped, self-addressed postcard or envelope to
the professor during the final exam period.

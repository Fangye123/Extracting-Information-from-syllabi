> **Course Description** :  Course will update the research information on the
phytochemicals and describe their role in human diet. There are many
biologically plausible reasons why the consumption of fruits and vegetables
help slow or prevent the initiation of cancer and other chronic diseases.
Fruits and vegetables contain a myriad of phytochemicals or bioactive
compounds shown to have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antitumorigenic and
healing effects.  Besides being the main source of dietary fiber and vitamins,
principal compounds found in fruits and vegetables include: carotenoids (beta
carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene and cryptoxanthin), flavonols
(quercetin, kaempferol, and myrcetin), flavones, flavonones, tocopherol,
elenium, dithiolthiones, isothiocyanates, indoles, phenols, protease
inhibitors, organosulphur compounds, limonoids and plant sterols. The
multidisciplinary faculty involved in this course hold international
recognition in phytochemicals research, education, World Wide Web (WWW),
evaluation and dissemination.  The course will utilize interactive video,
electronic mail, and WWW to develop and disseminate instructional material to
participating students.  Syllabi, course schedules, curricula vitae, slide
sets and lecture notes will be made available on the web site for student
downloading.  The course will be compatible with educational goals and will
feature student, peer, and faculty assessment opportunities. The course will
be evaluated by formative and summative methods. The course will also discuss
the toxic effects and sources of phytochemicals.

>

> **Course Objectives:** The primary goal of the course is to provide
opportunities for students to acquire knowledge in the various disciplines of
agriculture, food science, nutrition, biology, chemistry, medicine, and
toxicology as they relate to the effect of fruits and vegetables on human
health.

>

> **Requirements:** Undergraduate students should have higher GPR (either
senior   or non senior) and are required to take 3 tests and final. Graduate
students are required to write a manuscript in compliance with journal
specified by the instructor based on the topic, and are required to take 2
tests and final and as well as a paper.

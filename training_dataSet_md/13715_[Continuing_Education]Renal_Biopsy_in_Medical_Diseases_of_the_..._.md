**_Program Description & Objectives_**

Renal Biopsy in Medical Diseases of the Kidneys** is an intensive 3 1/2 day
course designed for pathologists, nephrologists, internists and other
physicians interested in both a systematic review and an update on advances in
diagnostic problems in medical renal diseases.

The course should be of special interest to physicians who are preparing for
their specialty Board Examinations in Pathology and Clinical Nephrology. At
the conclusion of the course, participants should be able to better understand
the pathophysiology and clinical apects of the major parenchymal diseases if
the kidney, with emphasis on clinical-pathologic correlations and the role of
renal biopsy.

The format includes lectures, question-and-answer sessions and the study of
case problems. An optional four hour Renal Pathology Laboratory exercise is
available on Saturday afternoon after the conclusion of the formal lectures.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

Read these requirements closely, because they tell you all you need to know
about the operation of the class and the requirements for your paper.  Don't
read these once and then forget them, because you'll be judged on the basis of
them.

_ATTENDANCE_ : I only take attendance on Fridays, partly to get to know
students' names, and partly to make sure people give sufficient importance to
this part of the course.  Part of your discussion grade is also a grade for
attendance -which means showing up for lecture on time.  If you happen to be
late for lecture once during the semester, I'll overlook it.  If you're
someone who makes a habit of walking in after I begin lecturing then you'll
feel the impact quite significantly in your semester grade.

_READING_ : All students must complete the reading for the course.  (Note that
several of the books are heavily abridged and are much shorter than they
appear).  Weekly assignments are indicated in the syllabus.  It is very
important for you to complete the reading in time for the Friday discussion.

_DISCUSSIONS_ : On Fridays, class will be devoted to a discussion of the
issues raised in lectures and in the reading.  You will not be able to do well
in the discussions if you haven't kept up with your reading.  It is expected
that you will have finished the week's reading assignment by the time of the
Friday discussion.  As much as possible, the discussions will be a friendly
exchange of ideas and opinions.  The discussions are intended to be fun and
enriching, not threatening.  Don't feel intimidated by a lack of background in
history; often there is no one "right" answer to the questions being
discussed, and undergraduates always do as well as graduate students in these
sessions.  **Part of your grade for the semester will be based on your active
participation (talking) in the discussions, so it is important to show up and
take part.**   Their purpose is to give you practice speaking about and
challenging ideas, instead of just memorizing them.

_PAPERS_ : For undergraduates, there will be one paper, 8 pages long, **DUE IN
CLASS ON MONDAY NOV 26**.   All papers must be double-spaced, and type-written
or printed by computer.  Handwritten papers will not be accepted.  Papers
should be stapled together; please do not use paper or plastic folders to bind
them.  Papers should be submitted with a separate title page on the front,
with a title, the student's name, and the name of the course.  Do not put your
name inside the paper, as each will be read with the title page turned back in
order to assure an objective, neutral reading of the essay.  This way your
performance in class discussion should not influence your paper grade.  No
paper extensions, even in the event of a nuclear war.  For every day the paper
is late, it will drop a full grade (for example, from a B+ to a C+).  These
papers are to be "think papers" instead of research papers.  I want to know
your perceptions and ideas.  The papers will be graded on the strength of
their ideas, their ability to advance a thesis or interpretation, and on how
well they are written (their use of language, spelling, punctuation, and
syntax).  Naturally, any plagiarism (having someone write the paper for you,
or copying it from another source) will result in an immediate failure of the
entire course.  Use endnotes to indicate page numbers for any quotes you use,
or to tell the reader when you have borrowed ideas from another author.

The paper should be written on the following topic: Discuss the ideas of one
of the other authors in relation to Emersonianism.  Choose one writer or
figure (for example, use Winthrop, Franklin, Tocqueville, Whitman, Douglass,
or Lincoln) and indicate the way in which their ideas either agree with or
contradict Emerson's outlook.  Is there a way in which they partake somewhat
in Emersonianism?  Or, conversely, do they provide a challenge to
Emersonianism?  What is Emersonianism, anyway?

_STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES_ : Students with disabilities covered by the
Americans with Disabilities Act should follow these steps: 1) Provide
documentation of your disability to the Office of Disabled Student Services
(08 Kellum Hall, 644-9566).  2) Bring a statement from the Office of Disabled
Student Services indicating that you have registered with them to your
instructor the first week of class.  The statement should indicate the special
accommodations you require.

_EXAMS_ : There will be two exams during the course of the semester -a midterm
and a final.  Both of the tests will be a combination of ten short
identifications and one essay question.  As in the papers, the exams will be
judged on the strength of their ideas, their ability to advance a thesis or
interpretation, and their use of language, spelling, punctuation, and syntax.
Make sure to write legibly enough to be understood.  Bring blue books for the
exam.  Put your name on the front, but not inside--to insure a neutral
reading.

_GRADES_ (FOR UNDERGRADUATES): Each of the four components of the class will
count 25% toward the final grade: the two exams, the paper, and class
discussion.

_COURSE WEB SITE_ : This course has its own page, linked through my web site
at: http://mailer.fsu.edu/~njumonvi . Hey, come to think of it, you're already
here.

_OFFICE HOURS_ :  Fridays 11-12 in Johnston 239.

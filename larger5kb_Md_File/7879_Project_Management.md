Course Description (Syllabus follows):  
  
Managers are increasingly being involved in and assuming responsibility for
the management of projects. These projects may involve the development of
information systems, new products or processes, single or multi-purpose
systems, infrastructure or other development projects for the public or
private sector in developing or developed countries, and host of other
applications.  
  
Project management is widely used in business to accomplish unique outcomes
with limited resources under critical time constraints. Many managerial
problems are associated with planning, directing, and controlling resources to
meet the functional, cost, and time constraints of projects. This course
focuses on various quantitative and time-cost tradeoffs, multi-project
scheduling, resource constrained scheduling, budgeting, cost control, project
monitoring, and human aspects such as biases.  
  
On completing this course, the student should have a thorough understanding of
the complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional issues in project management.  
  
Besides the exams, the students will be expected to complete and present a
group paper and project. Also, the students will be expected to learn on their
own a project management software e.g. Microsoft Project for Windows - in
solving related problems.

Course Description

Project management is widely used in business to accomplish unique outcomes
with limited resources under critical time constraints. Many managerial
problems are associated with planning, directing, and controlling resources to
meet the functional, cost, and time constraints of projects. This course
focuses on various quantitative and qualitative areas of project management,
such as project scheduling using PERT, time-cost tradeoffs, multi-project
scheduling, resource constrained scheduling, budgeting, cost control, project
monitoring, and human aspects such as biases.  
  
On completing this course, the student should have a thorough understanding of
the complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional issues in project management.  
  
Besides the exams, the students will be expected to complete and present a
group paper and project. Also, the students will be expected to learn
Microsoft Project for Windows on their own and use it for scheduling their
groups' project and paper.

Rules for Class Administration  
  
1\. GMU's honor code (see
<http://www.gmu.edu/departments/unilife/honorcode.html> for details) is in
effect throughout the course. No "assistance" of any kind is permissible
during exams. Project and Term paper are a GROUP effort.  
  
2\. Exams must be taken at their designated times. The only exception is an
emergency that you can document and I can verify. It is your responsibility to
note the dates and times of all exams.  
  
3\. ALL course deliverables (see schedule below) MUST be handed in at the
specified time, NO EXCEPTIONS, so plan accordingly.  
  
Grading  
  
1\. DO NOT ASSUME THAT I WILL CURVE. At the end of the course, based on your
total numerical score I will assign a final grade (A, A-, B+, etc.). Grading
based on a curve is an instructor's privilege NOT a student's right.  
  
2\. You may ask for a re-grading of your exam. Any such request must be made
by the end of the NEXT class after the exam is handed back. Reevaluation may
result in an increase or decrease of your score. After this period, the grade
for the exam is final and may not be changed.

Project Information  
  
1) You must be present during the second class to be assigned a team OR you
might be dropped from the class! Contact me before class if you cannot make
it.  
  
2) Groups will consist of 4-6 members. Team members distribute the workload
however they wish. Each group must designate one person as the team
representative to act as my POC to the group. The first task of the team rep
is to provide a list of team member names, phone numbers and email addresses.
I might merge groups based on the dropout rate.  
  
3) Each group will recruit a customer. The customers' project management
operations OR a specific project will be critiqued (positive and negative)
along the chapters covered in the book. You need to understand the projects'
attributes (e.g. org. level, function, size, complexity, etc.) and HOW & WHY
things are done they way they are.  
  
4) The purpose of the project status discussion is to INFORMALLY review where
groups are in terms of Status, Issues, Group Assignments, Next Steps, and
Lessons Learned.  
  
5) MS Project updates are due at regular intervals (see schedule) to update me
on your project and paper AND to demonstrate your knowledge of MS Project
functionality. Each update should be accompanied with a Word document
identifying what has changed from the previous update. First schedule should
contain a PLAN (baseline) and the remaining updates will contain ACTUALS.  
  
5) Final presentations will consist of a FORMAL presentation (in Powerpoint)
of the project and paper findings. Each group will have 30-35 minutes.  
  
6) The project score will be based on the analysis complexity, the quality of
the documentation, and the proper use of the English language. The SAME score
will be assigned to ALL group members. The report should NOT identify the
customer.  
  
  
Term Paper Information  
  
1) Same project groups work on the paper.  
  
2) Each group will be assigned a topic from the list below:  
  
Project Management Institute www.pmi.org  
Association for Project Management www.apmgroup.co.uk/theapm.htm  
Software Engineering Institute <http://www.sei.cmu.edu/>  
Malcolm Baldridge Award  
Total Quality Management  
ISO9000  
Datawarehouse  
  
3) For each topic above discuss the following:  
  
Definition or purpose or services  
Examples or case studies  
Pros/Cons  
Applicability to Project Management  
"Cost" of adapting in an organization for PM (use your customers' if you'd
like)  
  
4) The paper body should be no more than TEN pages long, excluding references
and other packaging material.  
  
5) Proper referencing and attribution is a MUST. For some guidance see
<http://www.uvm.edu/~ncrane/estyles>. You will be severely penalized if I
cannot trace your content to a source. Here's an example of a paper with
proper referencing
<http://www.cs.umbc.edu/~cikm/iia/submitted/viewing/iassr.html>  
  
6) The term paper score is relative to other groups and is based on
BREADTH/DEPTH and QUALITY of content (technical, layout, and proper use of the
English language). The SAME score will be assigned to ALL group members.  
  
7) WARNING:  
Severe penalties, ranging from assigning a ZERO on the paper to recommendation
to the Honor Committee of dismissal of ALL group members, if plagiarism is
detected or improper referencing is used.  
  
Course Deliverables by stated deadline on the schedule  
  
Final Presentation Slides in Powerpoint  
Project Report in Word (integrated)  
Term Paper in Word (integrated)  
Schedule in MS Project and cover letter in Word  
  
ALL deliverables must be sent to me via eMail. Each deliverable in it's OWN

Just what **is** "American Environmental History"? Didn't we have **enough**
to try to understand in our history without a whole new discipline? This
course will introduce students to this exciting and vital new field, beginning
with pre-Invasion Indians and concluding with an assessment of the American
environment today. Through readings and discussions we will examine a variety
of influential issues and themes. Particular emphasis will be paid to politics
(both domestic and foreign), gender, race, ethnicity and religion. The
assigned readings have been selected to provide a sampling of the variety of
current historical approaches to this lively discipline. Students will be able
to hone their own historical skills through class discussion of readings, a
midterm and a final exam, one brief book review, and a research paper on a
topic of their choice.

In the words of environmental historian Robert Weyeneth, "Today it is common
for environmentalists to judge the American past harshly. It is easy to
measure previous generations against some modern 'ecological' yardstick and
find them greedy exploiters of the natural world who lived with no thought for
the future. To understand the complexities of the current environmental
crisis, however, we need to avoid simple generalizations that shift
responsibility from ourselves to the past. This course seeks to understand the
historical reasons why American society evolved as it did, heedless of
environmental consequences. We will analyze how people shaped the physical
environment, and how in turn environment has influenced human values and
cultural institutions." In other words, it is far easier to judge our
environmental past than it is to truly understand it. Yet it is the
understanding of our environmental past that is the key to our future.

Students are required to read each assignment _carefully_ and _completely_
BEFORE each date listed here. Participation in class discussion constitutes
10% of your course grade, to be determined by the quality, rather than
quantity, of your contributions. The study/discussion questions, which should
also be pondered BEFORE each class, are designed to facilitate lively
discussions. The other 90% of your course grade will be determined by:

  * 10% Brief review of William Cronon's _Changes in the Land_ (details on separate handout)

**10 FINAL EXAM: 1:30**

Both exams will be in essay form. I will be giving you a sample exam before
the mid term so you can see exactly what to expect. If you are uneasy about
your essay writing ability, here is a suggestion: Prepare one or two answers
from the sample exam or the study/discussion questions _before_ the exam. I
will gladly go over your essay with you individually and show you how to
improve. _After_ both exams I will make photocopies of the best answers
available for reading in my office. Students have found these samples
enormously helpful. Let me know of anything else you might think of to help
you do your best.

If you have dyslexia or any other learning or testing disability, please let
me know at the **beginning** of the semester so that we can make appropriate
arrangements.

Please do not hesitate to ask questions or make comments during class. If you
don't understand something (whether from the book or a lecture) chances are
excellent that others are also confused and could benefit from clarification.
Class participation does constitute 10% of your grade.

ECON120 INTRODUCTION TO ECONOMICS

* * *

  
**Course: ECON120**

  **Required Text**

WHAT IS ECONOMICS?,  James Eggert.  Mayfield Publishing.  
ISBN 1-55934-824-0

A GREEN HAWAI'I, Ira Rohter.  Na Kane O Ka Malo Press.  
ISBN 1-878751-12-3 **(Needed in November!)**

**Prerequisite:  **

**English Placement of 100**

**Course Description**  
This course introduces the way economic systems operate.  Contrasts the
American Economy with other systems.  Studies the operation of business.
Analyzes national policies in solving the economic problems of inflation,
unemployment, and foreign trade.  This is a one semester course for non-majors
in economics.

**Performance Based Learner Outcomes**  
The goal of this course is to gain a clearer understanding of how the local
economy and the U.S. economy operates.  To better understand the economic
policy pursued by our government, how it specifically impacts our lives and
our paychecks.  Students should come away from the course able to read and
understand articles in the news pertaining to economic issues.  Students
should be better consumers and better voters!

**Primary Teaching Method**  
There is not a lot of reading for this course so I expect every chapter
assigned to be read at least one time through before it is covered in class.
Important vocabulary words are printed in bold face type. I will supplement
the course material with a number of videos and hope to have at least one
guest speaker during the semester.  Class time will include lecture,
discussion, videos, and in class group assignments.

Homework assignments will include questions from the Chapters that I will
announce in class, Case Studies to be distributed in class and some Media
Exercises.  The Media Exercises will require you to find current news articles
and answer specific questions using them.  All homework will be announced in
class.  Some assignments will be completed in class working in groups of two
to four students.  In class assignments are my way of awarding attendance
points.  
    


We will also be playing the stock market game.  Selecting some stocks and
following them over a 10 week period.  This will incorporate some math and
graphing skills, please plan to bring a **calculator** to class and **more
than one color of pen or pencil.**

**Grading**  
          Two Tests                                   100 points each    
          One Final Exam                           100 points    
          Homework                                   70 points    
          Stock Market Game                     30 points 

**Course Grade**  
360 - 400 points **A                             **280 - 319 points **C**  
320 - 359 points **B**                             240 - 279 points **D**  
                          Less than 239 points **F**

**Class Policies**

  * Exams must be taken on the day and time they are scheduled unless specific arrangements are made with me _in advance._   I will be giving more information out about the format of your midterms and final exam when the time gets nearer. 



  * **Homework** is a very important aspect of this class, it allows you to apply concepts from your reading in the text and from lecture to real world problems and examples.   Homework assignments must be submitted by the due date. In most cases this will be one week from the time the material is covered in class.  Some assignments will be completed during class time.
  


  * To succeed in this course you must complete the homework assignments, they add up to over 1/4 th of your course grade.  No homework will automatically limit your potential class grade to a C, no matter how well you do on the exams!  For those of you who suffer test anxiety note that the homework carries the same weight as one exam.

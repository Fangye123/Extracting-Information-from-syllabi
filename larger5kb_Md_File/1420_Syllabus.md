**Description of the Course:  
**

The unbroken history of the Jewish people, especially in modern Europe, has
been altered by dramatic interruptions. Even before the Shoah (the Holocaust),
the conflicting forces of continuity and change characterized the development
of the Jewish people in modern Europe, with attendant repercussions throughout
the Jewish world, both elsewhere in the Diaspora and in (the Land of) Israel.
Among these momentous changes in modern Jewish life were the transformation of
the Jews (especially in Western and Central Europe) from a religious community
into citizens of their respective countries, religious reformation, the
emergence and increasing dominance of autonomist concepts of Jewish identity,
in particular Zionism and Jewish socialism (Bundism), and large-scale
migration to America and Palestine. In our time, the Shoah and the creation of
the state of Israel pose a new challenge to the continuity of Jewish life in
the Diaspora. This leitmotiv of continuity amid change will thus shape our
examination of the history of the Jewish people in its modern (eastern and
western) European context. Major topics include Jewish historical
consciousness; patterns of emancipation, assimilation, adaptation, and
migration; religious adjustment (Hasidism and Reform Judaism); the role of
women; anti-Semitism; Zionism; the American Jewish experience; the Shoah; the
reestablishment of a Jewish state in Israel; and Jewish life in Europe after
the Shoah. This course is intended to acquaint students with the study of
modern European Jewish history and assumes no prior training in the subject.
Many of the reading assignments will come from primary sources - diaries,
memoirs, novels, short stories, and folktales - and in class we will also
examine Jewish music and visual arts.

Content and Objectives:     Students in this course will examine the history
of Western philosophy from the Greek era through the middle ages to the
Renaissance, considering the central issues with which major philosophers of
the period were most concerned.

Requirements and Grading:  

The asynchronous learning format of this course means that we won't be meeting
together as traditional classes do. You are free to complete your work each
week at whatever time suits you. Nevertheless, by following the schedule
below, we'll be sure to learn together. Each day, students are required to do
all of the following:

  1. Carefully [read](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#rea) the designated passages from our textbooks; 
  2. Work through the associated "Lesson" and browse through other on-line materials that deal with the same topics; 
  3. Participate actively in the discussions under way in our [electronic forum](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#for); and 
  4. Complete any scheduled written "Assignment" and e-mail it to [gkemerling@newberry.edu](mailto:gkemerling@newberry.edu).
    Each [written](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#wri) assignment will be graded on the usual standards for philosophy courses, and the average of all assignment grades will count for about three-fourths of the final grade for the semester. After each, I'll e-mail you a report of the grade you earned on the most recent assignment and your course average so far.     

Informed participation in our electronic
[discussion](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#dis) of the readings is a
vital component of the course and will be graded, counting as the remaining
fourth of the final grade for the course. Please send an e-mail message to
**gkemerling@newberry.edu** as soon as you register for the course, so that I
can enroll you in the mailing list for class discussions. I'll be prompting
discussion of particular topics each week, but you are welcome to intitiate
additional discourse by making a claim or asking a question of your own.  

As you work with the lessons for this course, please note that they are
designed to be explored through your Web browser. Each of them is an on-line
hypertext document with multiple connections to other sources of information.
Please experiment freely with this new way of reading interactively, which
cannot be achieved by working with printed media.     Additional hypertext
materials you may wish to consult include: the [philosophy study
guide](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm), the
[dictionary](http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/index.htm) of philosophical
terms and names, a [timeline](http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/zt.htm)
showing the philosophers of the period, and a short list of other [Internet
resources](http://www.philosophypages.com/links.htm) for research in
philosophy.  
    

All students should be familiar with Newberry College policies on academic
credit, grading, and academic dishonesty, as published in _The Student
Handbook_ , including the following official statement: "If you are a student
with a disability, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during
the first week of class to inform him/her of any reasonable accommodations
needed."

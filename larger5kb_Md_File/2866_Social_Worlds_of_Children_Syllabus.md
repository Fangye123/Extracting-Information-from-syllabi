Course Description:

What does the social world look like from a kid's point of view? How do we
determine what is appropriate for children or not? How have corporations
created 'demand' for certain toys and childhood objects? How is childhood
socially constructed anyway? This is an upper division course which will
introduce students to the theories in the sociology of children and childhood
whilst using empirical examples of fieldwork with children and our own
childhoods as data to understand these theories. Unlike child development
studies, we are concerned mainly with how societies come to construct children
and childhood and not just the developmental stages that children go through.
We will do this by examining the history of childhood, kids' culture, children
in families and schools, children as workers, the 'traffic' in children, toys,
children's myths and stories, and children's understandings of gender, race
and class through international comparisons with Japan and Brazil.

_Requirements:_

Participation: Your attendance, preparation, and participation are key to
getting the most you can out of this seminar. Please come prepared for class
by completing the assigned reading before each class session.

> Each week (for 10 weeks) 3 students will be asked to prepare a discussion
overview of the readings with a detailed list of questions and to lead the
class in discussion. This means that you will have to read the assigned
readings a week or more in advance of the time that you lead the discussion
and come to discuss what you will do as class leaders prior to the class with
me. 5% of your grade will be based on this presentation.

>

> I expect students to be familiar with the university policies on plagiarism
and conduct in the classroom as published in the Fogcutter student handbook,
which can be found at: http://www.usfca.edu/fogcutter/

  
Attendance: I will take attendance at each class and your attendance will be
5% of your course grade. Please note that the schedule of topics and readings
is subject to change and that all students are responsible for any
announcements made in class. If you must miss class, you are responsible for
the material that you have missed (making up any assignments or getting the

11:20 a.m., you will be marked absent for that day.

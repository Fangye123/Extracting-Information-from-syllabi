Cinema and History in Europe: The First OneHundred Years Instructor: Bruce Thompson Course Description: This course will survey the history of cinema in Europe from itsinvention in the 1890s to the present. Each week will highlight oneof the major moments or movements in the history of cinema as well asone or more outstanding directors. Emphasis will be placed on thehistorical context of selected films and of the national filmindustries that produced them, as well as on innovations of style andtechnique. The course has no prerequisites and is open toeveryone. Course requirements: participation in discussion sections,two five-page papers, and a final examination. The syllabus below will undergo some revision, and, of course, wewill not attempt to view in class all of the films listed (though wewill see clips from almost all of them). We'll see one complete filmeach week, and we may supplement the regular lectures with somespecial night screenings to accommodate longer films. 1.

History of China: Qing China 1644 - 1911 Instructor: Gail HershatterOffice: Merrill 111Phone: 459-4041E-mail: gbhers@cats.ucsc.edu Course Description: This course will examine the history of late imperial China in theQing dynasty (1644-1911). Whenever possible, we will look at whatChinese people have said about themselves in fiction, poetry,philosophical discourse, and memoir. Using visual images andartifacts as well as written documents, we will explore Chinesesociety as it was understood by inhabitants of the Chinese empire andby outsiders, and trace its transformation over time. We will payparticular attention to the daily life of ordinary people, but willnot neglect the forces that helped to shape that life: intellectualand religious beliefs, the imperial state, village and urban economicactivity, ethnic conflict, gender relations, family and kinshippractices, and millenarianism and rebellion. The final section of thecourse will focus on the crisis of social and political arrangementsin the late imperial state, the effects of foreign imperialism andpeasant rebellion in the nineteenth century, and the collapse ofChina's dynastic system in 1911. In addition to attending class and discussion sections, studentswill write two five-page essays on assigned topics and complete a mapquiz, a midterm, and a final. Readings include:  Spence, The Search for Modern China Cheng and Lestz, The Search for Modern China: A Documentary   Collection Kuhn, Soulstealers: The Chinese Sorcery Scare of   1768 Mann, Precious Records: Women in China's Long Eighteenth   Century Cohen, History in Three Keys: The Boxers as Event,   Experience, and Myth  A required course reader also will be provided.

China Since the Cultural Revolution: Historiesof the Present Instructor: Gail HershatterOffice: Merrill 111Phone: 459-4041E-mail: gbhers@cats.ucsc.edu Course Description: This seminar will explore histories of the present in China,focusing on several intervals of intense political upheaval (theCultural Revolution of 1966-76 and the popular movement of 1989) andmore extended intervals of rapid change (the economic reforms of thepast two decades). We will analyze the tensions that led to theCultural Revolution and trace its tumultuous development. Then wewill examine the construction of collective historical memory of theCultural Revolution, drawing upon the writings of Chinese novelists,essayists, and historians. We will look at Chinese society during thepost-Mao reforms, exploring the social, economic, and politicalfactors in the appearance and suppression of the 1989 populardemonstrations. Finally, we will trace the development of new class,gender, and ethnic relations over the past decade. We will meet twice a week. Since discussion is the heart of thiscourse, you should complete the assigned readings before each classsession and come prepared to share your opinions, observations, andquestions. Prior to each class meeting, you will be expected to turnin a 1-2 page typed summary of the readings and your reactions tothem. You will also research and write a brief bibliographic essayand a paper of 20-25 pages on a topic of your choice related to thecourse. At various points during the quarter, each student willpresent her or his research and serve as critic for another student'sresearch. Your final grade will be based upon participation in classdiscussion, the informal written summaries, your class presentations,and your research paper. Several films will be shown in conjunctionwith this course. Since the class size is limited and everyone'sparticipation is important, I ask that you notify me in advance ifyou must miss any class session. Readings will be drawn from (but not be limited to) thefollowing:  MacFarquahar, The Origins of the Cultural Revolution   (excerpts) Schram, Chairman Mao Talks to the People   (excerpts) Gao, Born Red Chen, Colors of the Mountain Rofel, Other Modernities Chan et al., Chen Village Under Mao and Deng Calhoun, Neither Gods Nor Emperors Weston and Jensen, China Beyond the Headlines Schein, Minority Rules (excerpts) Litzinger, Other Chinas (excerpts)  A course reader will also be provided.

Studies in World History: Settler ColonialNationalisms Instructor: Terry BurkeOffice: Merrill 112Phone: 459-2287 (messages: 459-2855)e-mail: eburke@cats.ucsc.edu Course Description: In this seminar in world history, we will examine settler colonialnationalisms. European colonial rule took a variety of differentforms: exploitation colonies, settler colonies, and plural societies.For our purposes, we can divide settler colonies into two types:contested and uncontested. Unlike the New World and Oceania, whereindigenous populations suffered devastating decline soon aftercontact, the relative demographic balance between indigenous andEuro-American societies in the contested settler colonies of Ireland,temperate Africa, and Palestine tended to favor indigenes. It isthese societies that are the object of concern in this seminar. In an effort to get beyond the manichaean formulations thatotherwise inhibit their study - colonizer and colonized, white andblack, modern and traditional - this course explores the social rootsof politics in settler colonies in comparative historicalperspective. Common readings will focus on the cases of Ireland,Algeria, South Africa, and Israel/Palestine. Readings: For the first six weeks, we will read materialsin common in an effort to develop a common language of inquiry andshared framework of analysis. Students are encouraged to consider theparallel and shared histories of both settlers and natives using thetools of social and cultural analysis, through an examination of thefollowing topics: the land question, metropolitan/settler relations,strategies of control, popular culture, and nationalisms. Written work: For the first six weeks, students will do theassigned worksheet each week. In addition, they will do one shortpaper on a topic to be assigned. In the final four weeks, students will select a term paper topicwith the consent of the instructor, present a oral report on theirresearch, submit the first draft for criticism, then revise the paperand submit the final draft.

It aims to introducethe student to ways that scholars have identified and analyzed somesalient issues and trends in the history of the nineteenth-centuryUnited States. Simultaneously, it showcases disputes among historiansand changes that have taken place over time in the ways thathistorians have grappled with such historical topics. Course Requirements All students are expected to attend all meetings of the seminarand to complete all verbal, reading, and written assignments on time.During the course of the quarter, each student will write five briefessays (each approximately 5 pages in length) discussing the readingsassigned in a given week. Students who write for a given week willalso be expected to take a leading role in that week's seminardiscussion. Assigned Texts (all paperback)  Richard J.

I _ntroduction _**

> This course focuses on the search for natural knowledge in antiquity, the
middle ages, and the early modern era. We will look at the questions raised by
those who sought to explain the structure of the heavens and the earth, the
answers they gave, and the debates that were generated. We will also pay
attention to the interplay between the broader culture and the scientific
community. The only real prerequisites for this course are a sense of
curiosity about the complex set of enterprises we place under the heading of
"science", and a willingness to think carefully and creatively about the
course material.

> We will be seeking to move beyond our stereotypes about what "science" is,
by inquiring closely about the various ways in which people in times and
places different from our own have struggled to know the physical, biological,
and social worlds. The issues that we consider will help us gain a fuller
sense of what it meant to know nature in the period we call the "scientific
revolution", and will also open up areas of analysis that are still under
discussion today, such as the relationship between science and religion.

> In this course you will learn about the past, other cultures, and ideas
about nature, but you will also learn some philosophy as well. We cannot begin
to understand the scientific patterns of thought and practice in different
historical periods without also knowing the answers that people in other times
have given to such questions as: How should we expect nature to behave? How is
truth defined? What is a human being? What relationships make society
possible? What is our place in the universe?

### Course Information

Class meets on Thursdays from 3:30pm - 6:10pm in [Van Munching
Hall](http://www.inform.umd.edu:8080/CampusInfo/Facilities/Buildings/VMH/)
1203\.

#### Course Description

This course covers topics in telecommunications, economics, and public policy.
It is intended for MBA students who have a particular interest in
telecommunications, electronic commerce, and information technology. The
course describes how converging industries requires telecommunications policy
to be understood within the context of broader technology policy. The dramatic
change in the market due to the introduction of the Internet is a recurring
theme in this class. Therefore, the core concepts of economics and regulation
of telecommunications is developed within the framework of converging
technologies and industries.

Starting with basic economic concepts and incentives, this course examines the
structure of the telecommunications and related technology industries, the
role of regulation, and its impact on cost allocation and price setting. The
use of managerial economics gives us insight into the issues of individual
actors in the telecommunications and technology markets. Industrial
organization theory helps us address the issues of industry boundaries,
competitive advantage, and antitrust policy. This course will use an
integrated approach of managerial economics and industrial organization theory
applied to the interesting and complex environment of telecommunications and
technology policy.

### Structure of the Telecommunications Industry

[Bailey and [Lars Davies](mailto:lars.davies@ashursts.com), [Ashurst Morris
Crisp](http://www.ashursts.co.uk/)]

### Description

In this introductory class, we will discuss the outline for the course,
introduce ourselves to each other and discuss the course requirements. After
the administrative tasks, we will then describe the existing
telecommunications industry by describing the monopoly, oligopoly, semi-
competitive, and competitive telecommunication markets. An introduction to
LECs (Local Exchange Carriers), IXCs (Interexchange Carriers), and CAPs
(Competitive Access Providers) explains the different forms of competition (or
lack thereof) in the different marekts. We will discuss how firms can position
themselves differently than their competitor to achieve a competitive
advantage in telecommunications

### Telecommunications History and Law

[Bailey]

### Description

This class discusses the different modes of communication including
broadcasting, publishing, and common carriers. We discuss some of the leagal
constructs for these different modes of communication and some of its history.
This eventually leads to some of the most recent telecommunication policies
including the Telecommunication Act of 1996. With the introduction of
regulation, there are changes in the price and quality of telecommunications
service offerings. The limitations of such regulation are discussed. Included
in this discussion is an investigation of the concept of Universal Service.

### Telecommunications Liberalization and Privatization

[Bailey]

### Description

The movement of the telecommunications industry from publicly owned or
regulated companies to competitive firms is described within the process of
liberalization and privatization. For example, we discuss the World Trade
Organization agreement to introduce competition in the global
telecommunications market. Much of this movement includes an investigation of
emerging economies and the role of price regulation. Therefore, we will
discuss how regulators may choose to set prices of regulated telecommunication
companies (e.g. rate-of-return or price caps). In this class we will go into
depth with the incentives for incumbents and entrants in the telecommunication
markets.

### Technology and Competition in the Local Loop

[Student Presentations & Bailey]

### Description

This class will focus on new technology in the local loop. The local loop is
seen as perhaps the greatest bottleneck in the development of new broadband
services to the home. In this class, we will discuss the potential for new
local loop technologies including wireline (ADSL, cable modems) and wireless
(LMDS).

### Interconnection, Competition, and Global Networks

[[Stu Mathison](mailto:SLMathison@aol.com), Broadreach Associates
International, and Bailey]

### Description

The points where one network meets another are seen as an interface between
two or more companies. Interconnection agreements shape technology development
and the incentives of users and telecommunication companies to design and use
their network differently. We will discuss network externalities, the role of
regulating interconnection points, and the use of "call-back" in markets.

The class also addresses the ability for international partnerships to be
formed among telecommunication carriers and how the alliance structures affect
service offerings. The extremes of alliances include outright ownership of
partners such as the SBC purchase of PacBell and proposed purchase of
Ameritech. Other relationships, such as the World Partners alliance, require
no equity.

[Bailey and [Amitava Dutta](mailto:adutta@gmu.edu), [George Mason
University](http://www.gmu.edu).]

### Description

The question of why regulation exists in the telecommunications industry is
introduced starting with the core economic concept of a natural monopoly.
Issues such as what constitutes a common carrier are addressed. The class ends
with a discussion of network externalities and how network externalities
change the value of telecommunications services.

### Internet Economics - Internet Pricing

[[John Schnizlein](mailto:jschnizl@cisco.com), [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com).]

### Description

The introduction of the Internet into the telecommunications service offerings
is dramatically changing the nature of the market. Unlike traditional
telecommunications offerings, there is much more heterogeneity in the Internet
market. However, the Internet is still dependent upon telecommunications
services. How telecommunication regulation affects the Internet market and how
Internet regulation is developed is discussed along with the core concepts
about the economics of the Internet.

[Dean Howard Frank, [Robert H. Smith School of
Business](http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu), [University of
Maryland](http://www.umd.edu)]

### Description

The creation of technology and industrial policy by governments is very
diverse. In some industries in some countries, governments form outright
partnerships with industry to develop telecommunications and technology
services. In other cases, the government makes a concious decision not to get
involved. In this class, we explore how, when, and why governments adopt
industrial and technology policy.

### Electronic Commerce

[Bailey and [Joe Bass](mailto:jbass@rams.com), [RAMS](http://ec.rams.com)]

We will discuss the growing importance of electronic commerce for intra- and
interorganizational transactions to support a growing global economy. With our
guest speaker, we will explore some applications of electronic commerce and
the competitive environment of the Internet. This includes the reasons why to
adopt information technologies and electronic commerce standards such as
Electronic Data Interchange. How a company can use information technology as
an advantage is explored through the use of two examples: intermediation in
markets and price discrimination.

### Diffusion of Innovations & Economics of Standards

[Bailey and [Gary Poon](mailto:), DTVision]

### Description

The use of standards in telecommunications and other technology fields dictate
future technology development and the possible protection of consumers. This
class will discuss who and why standards are created including the economic
benefits and costs of de facto and de jure standards. The specific purpose of
promoting interoperability in telecommunications and computer industries is
discussed. Part of the new telecommunications and technology environments
includes the convergence of markets and the use of venture capital to grow
market share. New technology offerings which span the markets of
telecommunications, computers, the Internet, and broadcasting are discussed.
The difficulty of regulation of some new markets are discussed with Internet
telephony as a case study. Many technology development can trace their history
back to government and academic roots in their pre-competitive stages. Why and
how the government can get involved in the funding of technology including
dual-use technologies and technology transfer are discussed.

## Final Papers Due

### Intellectual Property and International Competition/Cooperation

[Bailey]

### Description

The roles of international bodies in the creation of telecommunication policy
is discussed with an emphasis on the role of the International
Telecommunications Union (ITU). The role of international settlements and the
opportunities for emerging markets to experience double-digit
telecommunications growth is discussed. The use of satellite technology and
satellite policy is also discussed.

This class will also look at the development and protection of intellectual
property. This is especially important in an international context for new
technology developments because of the global marketplace for ideas.
Furthermore, intellectual property may be used as a strategic weapon for
international competition.

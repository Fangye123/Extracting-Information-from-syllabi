**Enhancing Instructional Effectiveness by Integrating Information Competence
into the Disciplines**  
The purpose of this one-day workshop is to provide a learning opportunity on
how to incorporate information competence into your coursework. Collaborate
with other faculty members and librarians to develop an environment where
students can become skilled at finding, evaluating, using, and presenting
information.

The workshops will cover basic and advanced search strategies for library
online catalogs, databases, and World Wide Web search engines. Types of
information seeking assignments will be described along with sample
assignments using collaborative and active learning techniques. Faculty should
come prepared to develop a class assignment that incorporates information
competence skills. A comprehensive notebook of materials will be given to each
participant. An overview will be presented of all the various services offered
by the library to assist faculty in their teaching and research. Librarians
will be available throughout the summer months to assist faculty who want to
utilize library resources and services. Faculty assessments for the last four
Information Competence workshops were exceptionally positive. Sign up while
there is still space available.

**Welcome**  
Welcome to English 319. This course has as its focus a phenomenon very basic
and yet incredibly complex: the use of language to affect the world in which
we live. When we think of language as action, as having consequences in the
world (rather than simply reflecting or representing the world), we are
thinking of rhetorical activism. In this class, we'll study the words of
ordinary people who accomplished extraordinary things with language, people
who have had inspiring effects on the ways United States citizens experience
civil rights in this country.

The signers of the United States Constitution recognized the power of
rhetorical activism when they declared freedom of expression the most
important right of United States citizens. Susan B. Anthony and dozens of
other women spent eight decades using the only power they had, the power of
language, to ensure women their right to vote in this country. The persuasive
eloquence of Martin Luther King, Jr. changed this nation's consciousness as
well as the experience of civil rights for all of its citizens. And although
the United States did not ratify the Equal Rights Amendment, people like
Shirley Chisholm and Betty Friedan forever altered the expectations and
opportunities for women and men in this country.

How did these ordinary men and women accomplish extraordinary things by
speaking up and speaking out? More broadly, how do people use language to
define, reform, and even revolutionize politics and society? That will be our
central question as we study texts from several United States civil rights
movements: the antislavery, early woman's rights, women's liberation, 1960s
Civil Rights, and gay rights movements.

This class focuses on rhetorical activism, rather than the history of these
civil rights movements. That focus has important consequences, two of which
warrant particular attention. First, the texts we'll study have been selected
primarily because of the rhetorical principles they illustrate. They are not
historically representative of the civil rights movements we're studying. I'll
say more about that when I introduce the texts for the course.

Second, we will approach the content of the course--the movement texts--as
rhetorical critics, rather than as historians. Although we will need to know
the circumstances surrounding these texts, we will concentrate on the
rhetorical functions of the texts rather than their placement in history. For
example, we will concern ourselves with things like the kinds of appeals a
rhetor uses, the patterns of arrangement in a text, how a text reflects and/or
constitutes its audience, and the figures of speech and other elements of
style that emphasize or even demonstrate a text's arguments. At the end of a
semester-long history course you might expect to know well the key figures and
major ideas of the civil rights movements. On the other hand, at the end of
this course--if you participate fully and complete the course requirements
successfully--you can expect to understand language as action, rather than
representation; rhetorical activism as an indispensable component of civic
life; and, in pragmatic and technical (if introductory) ways, how people use
language to define, reform, and even revolutionize politics and society.

**Texts for the Course**  
Selecting the readings for this class was challenging but fun. The biggest
challenge was narrowing the list. There are dozens of texts that belong in a
course like this, but because of time constraints and to ensure rhetorical
variety, I had to eliminate some really wonderful ones. I believe the final
group of readings is interesting and provocative. I hope you will enjoy
reading for this class, even if you don't agree with some of the points of
view expressed.

I already mentioned that I selected texts based on the rhetorical principles
they illustrate, rather than the ways they historically represent the
antislavery, woman's rights, Civil Rights, women's liberation, or gay rights
movements. So, for example, we're not reading about women's reproductive
rights when we read from the women's liberation movement, nor are we reading
about labor issues within the Civil Rights movement. There simply isn't time.
Also, for instance, we're reading more of Stokely Carmichael's rhetorical
activism than Malcolm X's, even though Malcolm X was arguably a more popular
figure in the Civil Rights movement. And we're studying fundraising letters
from organizations including the Eagle Forum and NOW, although they were less
visible than other ERA texts. But each selection we're reading is on the list
for a particular reason, and we'll talk about these reasons during the
semester.

The readings have been compiled for your convenience and they are being stored
at EXCEL, a test preparation and copy center. You may use this set of readings
to make a copy for yourself at EXCEL. Their copies cost $.07 per page, with
optional additional charges if you want your copies bound or three-whole
punched. EXCEL is located at 1117 South University, above the Ulrich's
computer and engineering store. Their phone number is 996-1500. If you prefer,
I will provide you with a bibliography and you may make copies of the readings
on your own.

I ask people to refer directly to the texts during discussion. Please bring
assigned readings to class so that you can easily and quickly find the
passage(s) under  consideration.

**Primary Activities**  
The [ schedule of assignments](319syl.html) includes readings and two exams.
In addition, there will be occasional quizzes during the semester.

_Readings_  
I expect you to read all of the texts on the syllabus carefully and come to
class ready to talk about your reactions to them. I recommend that you read
with a pen in your hand, so you can jot notes or ideas in the margins of your
book. I use a color such as blue or red to contrast with the black ink
publishers use--that way, I can find my notes easily by paging through the
text. Stay away from highlighters: they encourage passive reading,
particularly since they cause you simply to mark a passage without writing a
note or a thought. I also outline speeches and essays on a separate sheet of
paper, especially listing passages which deal with key themes of the course or
that seem to have particular significance in the text itself. Imagine how that
kind of active reading will help you when you want to make a point in class or
on your quizzes or exams. What other kinds of "active reading" strategies work
for you?

_Quizzes_  
There will be several quizzes, usually unannounced, during the semester. These
quizzes will help you focus your reading, practice rhetorical analysis, and
synthesize and integrate issues important to the rhetorical activism we'll be
studying. They will also help you prepare for exams. Quizzes will be graded on
a ten-point scale. A missed quiz will result in a grade of zero for that quiz.
You may drop your lowest quiz grade.

_Exams_  
There will be two exams during the semester. These exams will include sections
in which you will be asked to define rhetorical terms, identify and briefly
comment on the significance of passages from assigned texts, and write longer
responses to questions that ask you to synthesize material from the course. We
will talk more about these exams in class. Bring lined notebook paper and a
blue or black pen to class for these exams.

_Participation_  
Class participation will be informally but clearly reflected in your quizzes
and exams, since these graded activities will benefit from the clarity of
thought and expression and the exchange of ideas which classroom activities
promote. I expect you to come to each session prepared, with reading
assignments completed. I also expect you to be attentive and responsive to
other members of this class--your colleagues. This classroom must be one of
mutual respect and open exchange. The University's _Statement of Student
Rights and Responsibilities_ explains that the University of Michigan "is
dedicated to supporting and maintaining a scholarly community. As its central
purpose, this community promotes intellectual inquiry through vigorous
discourse. Values which undergird this purpose include civility, dignity,
diversity, education, equality, freedom, honesty, and safety." If you have any
questions, please review this _Statement_ at [
http://www.umich.edu/~oscr/20010701SRR.html
](http://www.umich.edu/~oscr/20010701SRR.html) or call the [Office of Student
Conflict Resolution](http://www.umich.edu/~oscr) at 936-  6308.

**Services for Students with Disabilities**  
If you think you may need an accommodation for any sort of disability, please
contact [ Services for Students with
Disabilities](http://www.umich.edu/~sswd/ssd) (G-625 Haven Hall, 763-3000) and
make an appointment to see me within the first two weeks of the semester.

**Meeting Requirements**  
This class meets three requirements: the College of Literature, Science, and
the Arts's [ Race and
Ethnicity](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/dean/ug/race/race.html) requirement and
the Department of English Language and Literature's [ New
Traditions](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/English/undergraduate/general.htm) and [
American
Literature](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/English/undergraduate/general.htm)
requirements.

_LS &A;'s Race and Ethnicity Requirement_  
Students enrolled in the College of LS&A; are required to take a course which
meets the college's Race and Ethnicity requirement. As the college's website
explains, R&E; courses "address issues arising from racial and ethnic
intolerance." Because in this course we will consider the influence of racism
(as well as sexism and heterosexism) and the ways in which intolerance results
in inequality in the United States, and because we will also attend to
comparisons of discrimination based on race, gender, sexual orientation, and
other factors, this class has been approved by the College of LS&A; to fulfill
its "Race and Ethnicity" requirement.

_English's New Traditions and American Literature Requirements_  
The Department of English Language and Literature requires English
concentrators to successfully complete one course in American Literature and
one course designated "New Traditions." According to the department's website,
a "course designated 'New Traditions' . . . focus[es] on the cultural
traditions of women, minority ethnic groups, and people of color." This course
has been identified as one which fulfills these  requirements.

**Office Hours**  
I will hold office hours throughout the semester. Office hours are an
extension of the classroom. You are welcome to come by with questions,
comments, and concerns. If you are enjoying a reading and would like to
discuss it further, if you are having a problem with something in the course,
if you don't understand something, come and see  me.

**Communication**  
_With Me_  
The most efficient way to get in touch with me outside of class time and
office hours is email. During the semester, I usually check my email every
weekday--more frequently than I check my campus mailbox for notes. I have an
answering machine on my office phone, but I check that only on days when our
class meets. Email is by far the best option.

I will use email to contact class members in case class is canceled because of
snow or some other emergency, or if I want to pass on useful information about
the course. I also will post this sort of information on the website for the
course, [ http://www-
personal.umich.edu/~alisse/ENGL319f01/index.html](http://www-
personal.umich.edu/~alisse/ENGL319f01/index.html).

_With Your Classmates_  
Your classmates are an integral part of your English 319 experience. I
recommend that you introduce yourself to people in this class (you will have
opportunities to do so early in the semester), and that you exchange email
addresses with several classmates so that you can form study groups, find out
what you missed in case of an absence, etc. This email exchange is voluntary,
so if someone declines to give you his or her email address, please respect
that  choice.

**Grading**  
Your final grade in this course is determined as follows:  
     Quizzes| 20%  
---|---  
First Exam| 35%  
Second Exam| 45%  
Remember that you may drop your lowest quiz grade, even if that grade is a
zero resulting from a missed quiz.

**Academic Integrity**  
Academic dishonesty, including plagiarism, cheating, aiding and abetting
dishonesty, and fabrication, will not be tolerated. Please read carefully the
Department of English Language and Literature's memo on plagiarism which is
posted at [
http://www.lsa.umich.edu/english/undergraduate/plag.htm](http://www.lsa.umich.edu/english/undergraduate/plag.htm).
If you have any questions about "what counts," see me.

**Some Final Notes**  
_Commercial Notetaking_  
The collection, recounting, promulgation, or selling of materials based on
this course, including its website, lectures, compiled readings, handouts, or
other activities and materials is prohibited.

_Changes in the Policies and Schedule of Assignments_  
These course policies and the schedule of assignments are subject to change.
If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out about such changes.

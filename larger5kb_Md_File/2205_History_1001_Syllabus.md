Welcome to United States History since 1877. As we survey this period in U.S.
history, we will pay particular attention to the questions above and how the
answers to these questions have changed over time. Along the way, we will
undoubtedly pose additional questions.

![](surve0{image1}.gif)**In this class,** we will do some of the things you
probably already associate with the study of history -- we will read a
textbook and try to gain an understanding of key events and trends in American
history. However, we will do many things that may be new to you. We will
explore history as a process of interpretation -- that is, not only as a
series of names and dates, but also as a process of figuring out what those
names and dates _mean_. As often as possible, we will use our class time as a
history  "lab" \-- a time for dissecting documents, examining artifacts, and
discussing important ideas.

EXAMS

The course will have a midterm and a final exam. Each exam will have two
parts:

Short-answer questions that assess your historical literacy. The class will
participate in deciding which historical "facts" are the most important to
know and, therefore, should be included.

Short essay(s) that ask you to draw interpretive conclusions based upon
historical evidence. These essays will be based on the study questions in _The
Power of Words._

The final exam will cover only the material covered since the midterm.

* * *

**INFORMAL WRITING ASSIGNMENTS**

![](notepad.gif) Throughout the semester, you will be asked to do a series of
short, informal writing assignments. These assignments are intended to keep
everyone up-to-date with the reading and to develop skills that will help you
succeed on the exams for this course. _Please get a folder to save your
informal writing assignments in._ You are responsible for keeping all of your
work so that it can be evaluated at the end of the course.

All of the informal writing will receive a cumulative grade at the end.
However, on each day that an assignment is due, a random portion of the class
(sometimes everyone) will be asked to turn in that day's assignment. If you do
not have the work done, or if you are absent that day, this part of your
course grade will be reduced. (If you are absent, but you have done the work
for the day, you may fax it to: 215-925-6919.)

**These assignments may be hand-written if your writing is legible. Otherwise,
please type.**

**Each week, by Monday (unless specified otherwise):** You are required to
write an informal response to the assigned reading for the week. The
requirements are:

  * The response should be at least one-half of a page.
  * It should demonstrate that you have both done the reading _and thought about it._ (Summaries and outlines may demonstrate that you have done the reading, but they do not necessarily demonstrate that you have thought about it.)
  * When the assignment includes both the textbook and the documents book, your response must incorporate both.

You may do this in any way you wish. Here are some approaches that are likely
to contribute to your success on exams in this class (you may vary your
approach from week to week):

Reflect on what you learned from the reading that you did not know before.

Comment on the relationship between history and individual experience.

Select one or more questions in the documents book, and answer it/them using
both the documents and the textbook. (Or, similarly, choose one or more
questions from the textbook.)

Describe how you would teach this material to a high school or elementary
school class (specify which).

Make up a quiz that covers the material.

Reflect on connections between what you have read and the themes of our
course. Comment on how the reading for this class connects to other classes
you are taking or have taken.

Comment on how the reading connects to your own family history.

Discuss ways that current events relate to the history we are studying.

Answer questions in the on-line study guide for the textbook (you can e-mail
your work from the study guide to yourself, so you can print them out).

Create a glossary of terms that you want to remember in the future. In your
definitions, include _why_ these terms are significant.

**PROFESSOR'S DRACONIAN POLICIES** **Attendance** | **To be successful in this
course, you must attend regularly.** We will often spend our class time
discussing documents, an experience that cannot be duplicated by getting
someone's notes. Lectures will strive to add to the reading, not duplicate it.
Finally, if you are not in class to turn in an informal writing assignment,
you risk a reduction in your grade for that part of the course.  

**Also note: For freshmen, attendance is required.**  
---|---  
**Preparation** | **Thorough preparation is expected.** Unless otherwise
noted, reading assignments must be completed by Monday of the week they are
assigned. Quizzes may be added if lack of preparation is widespread.  
**Deadlines** | **LATE PAPERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED.** This applies to informal
writing assignments as well as all assignments related to the family history
paper. Exceptions will be made only in cases of unanticipated, unavoidable,
_documented_ emergency.  
**Where to turn things in** | **Bring your work to class.** _DO NOT_ slide
papers under office doors or leave them in the History Department. If you must
miss class on a day when an assignment is due, you may fax it to: (215)
925-6919. The fax must be received the same day as the class meeting.  
**Makeup exams** | **_Midterm:_** Makeup exams will be given only in cases of
conflict with university activities or in cases of _documented_ emergency. The
makeup will be given during a scheduled History Department makeup exam period;
this may be substantially later than the regular exam time. The makeup will be
different from the exam taken by the rest of the class.  

**_Final:_ ** Alternative exam times will be arranged only in cases when you
have two exams at the same time or three on the same day. The makeup will be
_after_ the scheduled final exam time. Under no circumstances will an earlier
final exam be arranged so that you can begin your summer vacation early.  
**How to contact the professor** | _Office hours:_ St. Augustine Center 223,
Mondays and Wednesdays,  

2:30-4 p.m., and other times by appointment. Please don't hesitate to ask.

**_Grades_**

Grades will strictly adhere to Villanova University's grading criteria. As a
reminder, an "A" is defined as:

"the highest academic grade possible; an honor grade which is not
automatically given to a student who ranks highest in the course, but is
reserved for accomplishment that is truly distinctive and demonstrably
outstanding. It represents a superior mastery of course material and is a
grade that demands a very high degree of understanding as well as originality
or creativity as appropriate to the nature of the course. The grade indicates
that the student works independently with unusual effectiveness and often
takes the initiative in seeking new knowledge outside the formal confines of
the course."

For other grade criteria, consult the University Catalog.

READING TIPS / SCHEDULE OF ASSIGNMENTS

**_Out of Many_ ** (abbreviated in the schedule as "Text"): This book will
give you the basic narrative of American history since 1877. It is your
responsibility to come to class knowing the highlights of this narrative. You
don't have to know _everything_. Concentrate on those aspects of the chapter
that seem to you to be the most significant. If this is the last American
history course you ever take, what will you want to remember in the future?

**_Out of Many_ on-line study guide**: <http://www.prenhall.com/faragher/>

This is available on the Web for you to use however you wish. For each
chapter, it offers multiple-choice and short-essay review questions as well as
links to interesting related Web sites.

**_The Power of Words_** (abbreviated in the schedule as  "Docs"): This is a
book of writings from the time period we are studying. Each chapter begins
with a public document, such as a speech by a political figure, and moves to
increasingly personal writings by individuals. As you read these, think
especially about the ways that public events affect personal experience. Each
chapter has review questions at the end. Your reading will be enriched if you
look at these questions _first_ , then keep them in mind as you do the
reading. Some of the study questions will be used as essay questions on exams.

**_Domestic Revolutions_ ** (abbreviated in the schedule as "DR"): This book
about the history of the family is for you to use with your family history
paper. It will not be covered by exams, and you do not have to read it in
conjunction with the other assigned readings. However, if you would like to
read this together with the other books, the related chapters are noted on the
schedule.

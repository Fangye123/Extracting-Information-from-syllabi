> **COURSE DESCRIPTION**  
>  ![](smallsep.gif)

>

> This course presumes that intolerance is not a mysterious and permanent
condition of the universe, but a historical phenomenon whose origins can be
examined and, one hopes, understood. The legacy bequeathed to us by the High
Middle Ages includes Arthurian literature, Gothic splendors, universities,
romantic love, and parliamentary government, but it also has a darker side. We
will examine how Europeans, as they defined their own culture between 1000 and
1400, came to identify certain groups -- non-Christians, gays, lepers,
heretics, the poor, etc. -- as "outsiders" to be marginalized, excluded, and
even persecuted. Readings from a wide array of primary and secondary sources,
combined with a series of short writing assignments, will enable students to
participate in current scholarly debates about the history of persistent
hatreds.

>

> Because History 100.81 is primarily a writing course, our approach to the
historical material will be selective rather than exhaustive; the topic is
meant to provide fuel for discussion and exposition as well as a starting
point for anyone who might want to pursue further studies in this sort of
history.

>

>

> **READINGS**  
>  ![](smallsep.gif)

>

> I have kept the readings for this seminar relatively short -- never more
than 75 pages per week, and usually much less -- in order to allow you more
time for thinking and writing. Therefore it is especially important that you
read carefully, actively, and (need I say it?) punctually. Reading assignments
are listed on the schedule next to their due dates; you should arrive in class
ready to discuss the texts. _Please bring the assigned materials with you to
every class meeting_ , since we will often do close readings of texts as a
group.

>

> **REQUIRED BOOKS:**

>

> R. I. Moore, _The Formation of a Persecuting Society_ |  HN380.P6 M82  
> ---|---  
> Thomas Kane, _The New Oxford Guide to Writing_ |  PE1408.K16 N5  
> Richard Lanham, _Revising Prose_ |  PE 1421 .L28 R4 1992  
> Karen Elizabeth Gordon, _The Well-Tempered Sentence_ |  PE 1450 .G65x 1993  
> Course Readings (photocopies) |  
> Webster's Tenth New Collegiate Dictionary (or a substitute, subject to my
approval)  
>  
>> _This is the book you will use more than any other. Please get into the
habit of looking up any unfamiliar words you come across in the weekly
readings. Remember: your spell-checker is NOT a dictionary; make sure you
understand the preise meaning of the words you use, and not just the correct
spelling._

>

> **OPTIONAL BOOKS:**

>

> Diana Hacker, _A Writer's Reference_ , 3rd ed.| PE1408.H118 W9  
> ---|---  
> Patricia O'Connor, _Woe Is I_|  not yet in library  
>  
> All books are on two-day reserve in Uris Library. I've also placed copies of
**_Western Civilization:The Continuing Experiment, Volume I: to 1715_ (eds.
Thomas F.X. Noble et al.) ** on both two-hour and two-day reserve in Uris.
This brand new textbook -- which is engaging and clearly written, with
beautiful color photographs and maps -- will answer your more general
questions about the Middle Ages. You should read or at least skim the medieval
section at some point early in the semester. CB245.W515 v.1

>

> **POLICIES**  
>  ![](smallsep.gif)

>

> Successful seminars are based on mutual respect. I will treat you as
intelligent adults and give you a say in how the course is run. In return I
ask that you accord your classmates and instructor the same respect: by
listening when they speak, maintaining cordiality, behaving with honesty and
honor, fulfilling the requirements of the course, and accepting with grace and
maturity the grades you earn.

>

> **_REQUIREMENTS_** for the course include:

>

>   * Eight short **essays** , two of which will be rewrites. Please turn in
essays by the beginning of class on the day they are due. Cornell's rules
forbid depositing papers in mailboxes or other unattended stations where
safety and confidentiality cannot be assured; assignments must be collected
and returned in person. You may rewrite more than two essays if you wish, and
I am always happy to look at drafts and revisions.

>

>> **ESSAY GUIDELINES**

>>

>>     * Please submit TWO COPIES of all writing assignments.

>>     * Essays must be typed, double-spaced, in a reasonable  
>  font, with one-inch margins and numbered pages, printed  
>  in black (not faint grey) ink on white paper. Separate title  
> pages are not necessary.

>>     * Proofread your work -- don't just run a spell-checker.  
> Papers that have not been carefully proofread will be  
> downgraded or returned without a grade and counted as  
> late. Getting a friend or roommate to read over your work  
> is an excellent idea.  
>> ---  
>  
>   * **Peer editing** , which students say is one of the most fruitful and
enjoyable parts of a freshman writing seminar.You and you classmates will have
several chances to exchange and comment on one another's drafts and papers
(I'll give you guidelines for how to do it). You will also get to work in
groups on several in-class exercises. _Expect your writing to be seen by your
classmates._

>

>   * A **[grammar notebook](grammar.html)** , to be checked at week 8 and
turned in at the end of the semester. (We'll talk more about this - it's a lot
more fun than the name suggests.)

>

>   * A regular **e-mail journal** , in which you can record your reactions to
the reading assignments. This journal is intended to keeep you from falling
behind on readings, to prepare you to contribute to class discussions, and
above all to give you practice reading the way you should in college: actively
and thoughtfully, asking questions of the text instead of letting it wash over
you. When I assign e-mail journals, I will suggest questions for
consideration; you are free to go beyond these questions, however, and if you
get the urge you may write more journal entries than are assigned. _Treat the
e-mail messages as an opportunity to express freely your own thoughts,
opinions, observations, and questions._ You may also use them to float
preliminary ideas for your essays. Because they are informal, you needn't be
overly concerned with structure, organization, and rhetorical polish in your
e-mail messages; you should nevertheless strive for precise vocabulary and
clear, fluent expression of your thoughts, just as you would in conversation.
For obvious reasons, I cannot give credit for late journal entries.

  
>  **ATTENDANCE** is critical to your success in this course. Unlike large
lecture courses, seminars are collaborative efforts which depend on the
consistent participation of everyone in the group. Attendance records will be
kept. If you need to miss a class meeting, I expect you to contact me by
e-mail (preferably before the class) with an explanation of your absence. You
should then seek out a classmate who can fill you in on what you missed, since
**you will be responsible for all material covered during class.** Please be
aware that in-class assignments cannot be made up and that unexcused absences
will visibly affect your final grade.

>

> **_LATENESS_** disrupts the entire class and is unacceptable. Be ready to
start promptly at 10:10; I will not repeat announcements or course material
for late arrivals. Do not, however, skip class merely because you realize you
cannot arrive on time -- it's chronic tardiness I'm worried about, not the
occasional, unavoidable slip-up.

>

> **_PLAGIARISM_** , whether deliberate or inavertent, has serious
consequences at Cornell. We will have handouts and discussions about how to
avoid plagiarism. If you ever feel unsure of the rules for citing sources, be
on the safe side and ask your instructor for advice.

>

> **_GRADING_** is not an exact science in a writing seminar, though teachers
break it down into neat-looking percentages to comfort ourselves and our
students. I will usually pencil tentative grades onto your papers, but since
rewrites are always permitted, I will not record a grade until you tell me the
paper is finished. **Improvement** over the course of the semester will
dramatically affect your final grade, but this does not mean that students who
write excellent papers at the beginning of the course will be penalized.

>

> The **grammar notebooks and e-mail logs** are requirements of the course and
will not be given letter grades. Exceptionally thorough notebooks and well
thought-out e-mail logs will improve your final grade, whereas a weak,
perfunctory showing in these assignments will lower it. I will allow you to
skip two e-mail assignments; beyond that, incomplete notebooks and journals
will weigh heavily against you.

>

> Grades will be based on your writing and peer editing (75%), and on your
active participation in the course (25%), plus any extra credit you earn. "
**Active participation** " includes:

>

>   * coming to class prepared and contributing to discussion

>   * offering thoughtful commentary and questions in your weekly e-mail
journals

>   * seeking out the instructor when you need to discuss drafts and revisions
of your papers

>   * keeping lines of communication open - if you have a problem, a question,
an idea, or an opinion on how the course could be improved, don't wait until
the end of semester to speak up! This course is yours, and you'll get the most
out of it if you make your voice heard.

>

> Our writing seminar is a cooperative effort and demands more than mere
spectatorship. Once we all get to know one another, I hope everyone will
relinquish the natural fear of looking foolish and begin instead to think of
this class as a safe place to make mistakes and to learn from them. Remember
that no comment or question will ever be penalized; if you're embarrassed
(which you shouldn't be), then take advantage of e-mail and office hours.

>

> If you ever want to know how you are doing in the course, or what you would
need to do to achieve a certain final grade, please schedule an appointment
with me to discuss your progress.  
> ---  
>  
> **_CONFERENCES_** : You should schedule two conferences with me during the
semester to discuss your writing. I will need to approve the topic you choose
for your final paper.

>

> **ADDITIONAL RESOURCES**  
>  ![](smallsep.gif)

>

> Learning to write well is a lifelong process. Fortunately, those of us who
are serious about writing have at our fingertips some splendid guides,
manuals, and references to help us in our daily task. I've spent years
gathering a shelf-full of my favorites, which I gladly share with you. Titles
marked with an asterisk are on reserve at Uris Library. Of course, no one
expects you to peruse all these resources during a single semester! Nor are
you required to memorize an entire grammar manual before the summer (if we
knew them by heart, we wouldn't need handbooks). Rather, I offer you the list
in the hope that you may find it useful during your Cornell years and beyond.
Your suggestions are welcome!

>

> **DICTIONARIES:**

>

> The _Oxford English Dictionary_ (OED) is the closest thing we have to a
final authority on our language. You can find it in Olin Reference [PE1625
.M98 1989], Uris Reference [PE1625 .M978 1989] and on CD-ROM in Olin's
Electronic Texts area [Olin Ref. Disk PE 1625 .M98 1992]. (I am negotiating
with the reference librarians about getting Cornell subscribed to the online
OED service.)

>

> Everyone must have a desktop dictionary for daily consultation, though, and
the OED is rather bulky and expensive for that purpose. I suggest _Webster's
Collegiate Dictionary_ for its comprehensiveness and its thorough etymological
notes. Of course, there are many excellent dictionaries out there; you can
consult the [alt.english.usage FAQ](http://www.cis.ohio-
state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/alt-usage-english-faq/faq.html) for comparative
notes on several of them. _Note: Webster's Collegiate Dictionary is now
available[online](http://www.m-w.com/netdict.htm), but you still need your own
printed dictionary; as we all know, electronic services often go down just
when you need them._

Barnstone and Chou Ping, 1996. ISBN 1-57062-092-X. Unusual, insightful, and
frequently humorous.

>

> Borealis Bookshop (111 N. Aurora Street, across from Manhattan Bagels) has a
good selection of books on writing. Well worth a browse.

>

> **OTHER WORKS OF REFERENCE:**

>

> Need a pithy and pertinent quotation? Try _Bartlett's Familiar Quotations._
Using quotations is a wonderful way to make your point or to appear better
read than you are, but don't overdo it. Olin Reference + PN6081 .B28 1992

>

> _The Reader's Encyclopedia_ , ed. William Rose Benet, is an amazingly useful
encyclopedia of world literature. Uris and Olin Reference PN41 .B46 1987

>

> _Brewer's Dictionary of Phrase and Fable_ (now in its fifteenth edition) is
the place to turn when you want to know where a phrase or expression came
from; it's full of fascinating and entertaining articles. Uris and Olin
Reference PN43.B84 D5 1981

>

> An atlas frequently comes in handy. I like _The Rand McNally College World
Atlas_.

>

> I've never found a _thesaurus_ to fall in love with, but I suppose _Roget's_
is the standard work. (If you have a favorite thesaurus, I'd welcome
suggestions.)

>

> **CORNELL'S RESOURCES FOR WRITERS:**

>

> **The John S. Knight Writing Program office** (Goldwin Smith 159) maintains
a lending library of dozens of books on all aspects of writing; here you can
find specialized works on organizing research papers, for instance. Drop by --
they're friendly.

>

> **The Walk-In Center** (Rockefeller Hall 174) is staffed by tutors who can
help you develop your ideas and improve your drafts. It's available to ALL
Cornell students, not just freshmen. For complete information on this service,
see the attached handout.

>

> **Your peers** are your greatest resource at Cornell, so use them! Have a
friend read and offer advice on your drafts; ask a roommate to help you find
the perfect word that's eluding you; e-mail a seminar classmate to discuss
your ideas or outlines. By the time you graduate, you will find that you've
learned more from your peers than you have from all your books, labs, and
lectures combined (no exaggeration -- ask any college graduate!).

>

> **GOOD READING:**

>

> ****

>

> The single best way to improve your own writing is by a steady diet of good
reading. The converse, "garbage in, garbage out," is also true; you will find
it well-nigh impossible to achieve a graceful, controlled style if you bathe
your senses in the bastardized English of television shows, corporate memos,
amateurish journalism, and turgid academic journals. Fine writing is
lamentably scarce and getting scarcer, but it can still be found in a few
places. Try these:

>

> _Harper's Magazine._ Recent issues in Olin Periodicals Room, back issues
Olin + AP2 .H29

>

> _The Onion_. (Yes, believe it or not! The movie reviews and "Savage Love"
column are particularly well written.) Available online at
<http://www.theonion.com>.

>

> _Times Literary Supplement._ Recent issues on newspaper shelves in Olin and
Uris.

>

> _New York Review of Book._ Recent issues on newspaper shelves in Olin and
Uris. __

>

> __Our **newspapers** , regrettably, are written at the level of a twelve-
year-old's comprehension and are typically riddled with errors. If you must
read newspapers, I would recommend you sample the British broadsheets now
available on the web and in the Olin basement. Try the _Times_ , _Telegraph_ ,
or _Manchester Guardian Weekly_. All are kept on Olin's newspaper shelves
(downstairs), and the _[Times](http://www.the-
times.co.uk/news/pages/home.html%3F1137626)_ and
_[Telegraph](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/et/access%3Fac%3D127312422803&pg%3Dhome.html)_
publish electronic editions.

>

> **Superb Essayists and Reviewers** include Clive James, Dylan Thomas, Mark
Twain, Lewis Lapham, Matthew Parris, Thomas F. X. Noble, Michiko Kakutani,
Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Toni Morrison, Paul Fussell, Stephen Fry, and
Dennis Miller, to name a few. Read them for inspiration and pleasure.

>

> For good **fiction** in a variety of styles there are always the _Norton_ ,
_Oxford_ , and _Penguin Anthologies_ , and one I particularly like called _The
Story and Its Writer: An Introduction to Short Fiction_ , ed. Anne Charters
(St. Martin's Press, 1983), ISBN: 0-312-76251-8 (not in our library).

>

> ****

>

> **ELECTRONIC RESOURCES:**

>

> PRESCRIPTIVE GUIDES AND ELECTRONIC PUBLICATIONS:  
>  I strongly recommend you browse through the wonderful online resources now
available to writers. (For one thing, they're free! And many of them are
searchable.) On the Web you can find such things as the complete texts of
Webster's Collegiate Dictionary and Strunk and White's _Elements of Style_ ,
several complete grammar manuals, answers to frequently asked questions,
annotated bibliographies, classic essays on language and style, and a wealth
of advice from writers, teachers, and journalists. I maintain an up-to date
list of links to these resources on the course's [main webpage](index.html).

>

> DEMOCRATIZED DISCOURSE ON THE INTERNET:  
>  "Indeed a friend who went to the school with me once remarked that after
reading Usenet for a week he was glad he had gone to a school that included
grammar and spelling in the teaching." In cyberspace you are what you write.
Alas, the internet, once a preserve of the fairly literate, has in latter
years sunk to a level of discourse so appallingly low that even USA Today
looks coherent in comparison; to read Usenet now is to endure a seizure-
inducing barrage of braying illiteracy and slovenly speech. Nevertheless,
there are still a few bright spots amid the muck. The skilled writers who
prize rhetoric now congregate in certain newsgroups, where they exercise
ruthless quality control and snap pitilessly at the flanks of linguistic
bunglers. (See me if you want to find them. A word of caution: lurk long
before posting.)

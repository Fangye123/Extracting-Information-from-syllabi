**COURSE OVERVIEW:**  
This course provides an overview of the history of the built environment from
the beginnings to about 1400 ce. The scope is broad in geographical and
cultural terms. Although the prime emphasis is on the Mediterranean basin and
the West in general, a substantial number of lectures will be devoted to Asia,
Africa, and the pre-Columbian Americas. Our aim is to expose you to the
architectural heritage of the past in its social and historical context.  
  
**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**  
In order to pass the course you must complete all of the requirements.  
[1] Regular attendance at lectures.  
[2] Faithful attendance and participation in sections.  
[3] Term paper proposal, partial draft, full rough draft, and a term paper
with a text of at least 10 double-spaced typed pages, not including notes,
bibliography, or illustrations.  
[4] Assigned reading.  
[5] Mid-term and final examinations.  
  
**FINAL EXAMINATION:**  
The final examination is scheduled for December 18, 2001, 12:30-3:30.  
There will be no early examinations given for any reason.  
  
Examinations in Arch. 170 differ significantly from those in non-visual
courses because they include slide questions. These, and to a certain degree
all other questions, require precise information stored in your memory.
Without knowing the names, dates and locations of the buildings and cities you
have seen, it is difficult to discuss their place in history and their
importance to the cultures we study. Similarly, without some knowledge of the
general styles and periods, it would be impossible to discuss individual
monuments. The examination format varies from year to year. Past exams have
included slide identifications and slide comparisons between buildings or
complexes which may or may not have been discussed in lectures or in section.
Beyond this visual material, the examination would also include brief
definitions of terms and proper names, questions based on the reading, and an
essay touching upon some major concern of the course.  
  
**GRADING POLICY:**  
[1] All five requirements (see Course Requirements) must be completed to
receive a passing grade. Any student failing to attend sections, to take both
exams, or to submit all portions of the term paper will be receive an F for
the course, no matter what the average of the completed assignments. Please
take special note that you must hand in your complete rough draft with your
finished paper. Your draft must obviously be an earlier, significantly
different version of your paper, with editing. No paper will be accepted
without an accompanying rough draft.  
[2] NO Incomplete (I) grades will be assigned except for medical reasons, and
only when accompanied by a physician's note.  
  
**REQUIRED READING:**  
Spiro Kostof, _A History of Architecture: Settings and Rituals,_ 2d ed.
(available at Campus Textbook Exchange on Bancroft Way)  
A short reader, available in a couple of weeks.  
  
**THE TERM PAPER:**  
The purpose of this three-step exercise is to introduce you to the process of
scholarly research and the techniques of modern historical writing. It will
help to show you how historians arrive at conclusions and how they communicate
their findings. On a more general level, the project will require you to get
to know the library system, learn to track down specific information, and
practice your writing skills. You are expected to utilize many of the wide
range of resources available to students on this campus.  
  
**NOTE: PLAGIARISM IS THE MOST SERIOUS ACADEMIC OFFENSE. IT WILL NOT BE
EXCUSED FOR ANY REASON. ANYONE GUILTY OF IT WILL RECEIVE AN F FOR THE COURSE
AND WILL, WITHOUT EXCEPTION, BE REPORTED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND TO THE
UNIVERSITY. IF YOU ARE AT ALL UNCERTAIN WHAT PLAGIARISM IS, PLEASE CONSULT THE
PROFESSOR OR YOUR GSI.**  
  
The term paper consists of four parts:  
  
**[1] An annotated bibliography and project proposal, 2-3 pages, due in
section September 20-25** (whichever day your assigned section meets). Your
bibliography must include at least 3 citations of articles from scholarly
journals. This assignment should include a 1-to-2-page discussion of your
research objective, including the building(s) you are studying, the questions
you are seeking to answer, and the way you plan to answer them. This should be
an overview of your project - where you are going and how you plan to get
there. Following this discussion of your project you should list the sources
you will be using in standard bibliographic form and state in a few sentences
how the source pertains to your project - how it helps to answer your research
question. This assignment must be typed with double spacing on 8
1/2-by-11-inch paper.  
  
**[2] An partial draft or in-depth outline of your paper, due in lecture Oct.
25**. You must submit the partial draft/outline in order to pass the paper
requirement. The partial draft should consist of a portion of your paper,
meaning that it makes sense by itself, even though it does not include your
entire argument. It might consist of the discussion of a single building, the
analysis of one aspect of your problem, or some other module of the final
work. Most likely it will cover one section of heading of your outline. The
draft should be as polished as you can make it, recognizing that when you have
written the entire paper, you may have some new information or your argument
may change. The purpose of this portion of the term-paper assignment is to
offer you suggestions about your writing style, the way you develop an
argument, or your use of evidence while there is still time to improve your
paper.  
  
**[3] An analytical essay, 10-12 pages of text, due at the beginning of
lecture Nov. 29**. Presentation and mechanics are as important in writing as
they are in design. This doesn't mean that you should spend hours designing an
elaborate cover for your paper. It does mean that, having written your paper
as well as you can, you should then take care that it is carefully assembled.
Papers must be typed on 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper. ALL ideas, information,
quotations, and illustrations taken from your sources must be footnoted. A
bibliography of the sources you used must be included. Edit your work, and
make certain that it is free of typographical errors, and that the notes,
bibliography, and other mechanical elements follow a consistent format. There
are many acceptable guides to format, including the _MLA Style Sheet_ and the
_Chicago Manual of Style_. One that is particularly easy to use is Kate L.
Turabian, _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations,_
which is available in all libraries and in nearly any bookstore. You should
also include appropriate illustrations, and refer to them in the text.
Illustrations, footnotes, and bibliography do not count in the 10-12-page
length assigned for the paper.  
  
**NOTE:** There is a progressive penalty for late work, meaning that the later
you are the more severe the penalty, so plan your work carefully and take into
account that there is usually a shortage of materials in the libraries during
the last two weeks before the term paper is due.  
  
**ALSO NOTE:** You must turn in your full rough draft with your term paper to
receive credit for your work (see Course Requirements above).  
  
**PICKING A TOPIC:**  
An historian begins a research project with a question. S/he then develops a
thesis that attempts to answer that question and continues to gather data from
the particular point of view set out by the thesis. Along the way the thesis
is continually checked against new conclusions drawn from the accumulating
data. Finally, a point is reached when the question seems satisfactorily
answered.  
  
Choose a building, a group of buildings, an urban agglomeration or a landscape
built within the chronological boundaries of the course, but which has not
been or will not be discussed at length in lectures or sections. GSIs will
help you choose an interesting topic that is well documented.  
Determine from some preliminary reading a significant question to ask. For
example,  
  
[1] How and why has a particular building type changed form over time?  
[2] Why do cities from the same culture take such different forms at diverse
periods or locations?  
[3] How is building form affected by technology?  
[4] How have the needs of the client or user affected architectural design in
a specific building?  
[5] What is the relationship between theory and practice in a particular
architect's work?  
[6] How did a particular style, technology, or building type move from one
culture to another? Why did it do so?  
  
The thrust of your research should then be to find and write up a convincing
answer to the question. Since the assignment is to write an analytical essay,
be sure you are asking and answering a question about your building(s).  
  
**THE ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY:**  
The historian who asks new questions never finds sources which give straight
answers. S/he plays detective, piecing together the story from all sorts of
angles. Sources might include the building itself, experienced in person and
through drawings and photographs; primary documents, such as contemporary
descriptions or contracts; and secondary materials, such as travelers'
journals or modern articles and monographs. Sources need to be evaluated. How
careful was the author? What was the author's point of view? How do his or her
prejudices and intended audience affect the usefulness of the work for your
research project?  
  
After choosing a topic, begin to build a bibliography of useful sources. The
assignment to be handed in September 20-25 should include a 1-2 page
discussion of your research objective, including the building(s) you are
studying, the questions you are seeking to answer, and the way you plan to
answer them. This should be an overview of your project, showing where you are
going and how you plan to get there. Following this discussion of your project
you should list the sources you will be using, following standard
bibliographical form and describing in a few sentences how each source
pertains to your project. At least three of your sources must be articles from
scholarly journals. You can locate them through standard references such as
the Humanities Index, Architecture Index, and the Avery Index. This assignment
must be typed with double spacing on 8 1/2 x 11 inch paper.  
  
**WRITING THE TERM PAPER:**  
Any good scholarly essay or book has an introduction, a main body, and a
conclusion. The point of view, the concept, the thesis, the focus, or whatever
one calls the guiding idea is set out in the introduction. Then the thesis is
supported by offering evidence that builds an argument clearly and logically.
Finally, a conclusion sums up and restates the thesis. You should have little
trouble organizing an essay once you have made a proposal and annotated
bibliography. You will know just which books and articles you need to read and
take notes on. You will know what it is that you are looking for when you
read, and will note facts and theories that both support and contradict your
thesis. While you are reading, begin to construct the outline for your essay.
The process will help you see relationships between ideas. It will steer you
toward a coherent paper in which:  
[1] The most important facts are given prominence  
[2] Facts are not gratuitous, but support the thesis  
[3] Analysis, not description, predominates.  
  
**THE DRAFT:**  
The partial draft or detailed outline should indicate your thesis and show how
the thesis will be developed. What is the organization of the paper? What
evidence will be used? The draft should show that you have done your research
and have begun to assemble both description and analysis into a coherent
essay. The draft should also display your writing skills. The draft assignment
helps you to make orderly progress in the assignment - a paper written at the
last moment is not your best effort. It allows you to receive comments from
your GSI (TA), either on substantive or analytical issues, additional ideas or
sources to use, or writing mechanics.  
  
**THE FINAL PAPER:**  
The final paper must be typed on 8 1/2 x 11-inch paper and stapled in the
upper left-hand corner. No fancy covers! All ideas, information, and
quotations taken from your sources must be footnoted according to the format
set forth in Kate Turabian's _A Manual for Writers of Term Papers,_ the
_Chicago Manual of Style_ , or the _MLA Style Sheet_. Either footnotes or
endnotes are acceptable. Your bibliography should follow a standard format.
You should also include appropriate illustrations. Illustrations, footnotes,
and bibliography do not count in the 10-12 page length assigned for the paper.
And remember that your final paper is not complete unless you have also
attached the full first (rough) draft of your paper to it.

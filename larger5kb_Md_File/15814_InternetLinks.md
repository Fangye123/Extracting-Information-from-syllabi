  * Environmental chemistry and biotechnology 
  * Innovative remediation technologies for the treatment of hazardous wastes 
  * Fate and transport studies and toxic effects of pollutants 
  * Biodegradation of environmental contaminants 

  
Dr. Zhang's research areas include the fate and transport of environmental
contaminants and the development of novel remediation technologies for the
cleanup of contaminated soils and groundwaters. He is currently investigating
bioremediation of dinitrotoluene-contaminated soil in vadoze zone in an effort
to identify limiting factors for in-situ remediation. Dr. Zhang and his
graduate students currently are also investigating the partitioning behavior
of contaminants that are of importance nationwide as well as in the Houston-
Galveston Bay region. Research are being conducted to elucidate the effects of
surfactants on the partitioning and biodegradation of chlorinated solvents in
contaminated soils, and to investigate potential release of polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from contaminated sediments related to frequent
waterborne transportation in Houston Ship Channel.

This course surveys the history of both individuals and groups of American
women from pre-European settlement to the present. Through brief lectures and
in-depth discussions of assigned readings we will consider the experiences of
women of different classes, races, sexualities, and ethnic  
groups in relation to broad categories such as work, family, sexuality,
politics and ideology. Regular attendance and informed participation in  
discussions is essential to success in this class, so it is important to
complete the assigned reading carefully and on time. Short lectures will  
provide background and context for the topics as we go beyond what is
sometimes called the "master narrative," with readings and discussions that  
explore the experiences of Native American, Euro American, African American,
Mexican American, Asian American, and other American women.  
  
_Course Objectives:_  
*The student will gain an understanding of women's lives over time.  
*The student will become familiar with the ways that race, class, and ethnicity interact with gender in shaping the experience of individuals.  
  
_Required Books:_  
Linda K. Kerber  & Jane Sherron DeHart, eds., _Women's America: Refocusing the
Past_ \- 5th Edition - available @ SBX and other campus bookstores.  
  
Grades will be based on attendance, class participation (including research
and group work), short writing assignments, and a final test (Take-Home  
Essay Test).  
  
All students must be officially enrolled by June 28. No requests to add the
class will be approved after June 28. This is not negotiable.  
History 325 fulfills the requirement   for a GEC Social Diversity Course  
  
_Writing Assignments:_  
Women's America contains several types of readings: General Introductions,
Secondary Sources (Historians analyzing, interpreting particular issues,  
events) and Primary Sources (the Documents). The introductions, in particular,
pose questions that will be helpful in guiding your reading, writing, and
discussion. You should try to use a variety of these sources for your writing
assignments, making judicious use of quotes to illustrate your points. Make
sure to note your sources. E.g. "Although quick to appropriate European
technology, they and their people actively resisted European domination."
(Evans, p.34) Make sure that you stay in the past (the time period under
discussion); do not make judgments from a late 20th - 21st century
perspective. Most of the writing assignments will be formal essays, others may
call for more creative writing. Formal essays should have a Thesis, Body,  &
Conclusion. In the more creative assignments, please begin with a brief
statement explaining who you are writing as/about. All essays must be word
processed/typewritten and should be 2-3 pages.  
  
General Research Assignment to be completed by July 21  
You will compile a Bibliography of the sources that you have used to write
your papers, those that you found in doing the research assignments, and  
those you plan to use for your final paper. You may include any other material
that you read that is related to the course. I will provide examples of the
form you should use in this assignment.  
  
Grading will be based on:  
Attendance_____________________ 10%  
Class participation________________ 20%  
Research & Other________________10%  
Writing Assignments ______________ 30%  
I will count your 3 highest grades, but you must hand in all required papers
and they must be good efforts. Missing or careless work will receive  
a grade of ZERO which will be counted as one of the three.  
Final Essay____________________ 30%  
  
The final essay will be due on Thursday, July 25 in class.  
  
_Other:_  
Attendance at all class sessions is required. As noted earlier, it is critical
to the success of the class that you complete the assigned readings thoroughly
and on time. Please come to class on time. Please inform us if you know that
you are going to miss class. Given the size of the class, late papers will not
be accepted unless you have an exceptionally serious reason for being late.  
  
Cheating and copying material without noting its source are serious academic
offenses which you will wish to avoid. If you have questions  
regarding the form for citations please feel free to ask us for help.  
  
Courteous behavior is expected (talking out of turn, reading newspapers, and
other non-historical pursuits during class will not be looked upon  
kindly).  
  
All students with disabilities should see me, privately, during my office
hours, as soon as possible.  
  
Should you have any questions or concerns regarding the class, please feel
free to bring them to my attention.  
  
I am looking forward to a productive and enjoyable five weeks.

Monday: Introduction  
  
Tuesday: Gender & the New Women's History pp. 3-24  
Come to class prepared to discuss this reading. Write (handwritten is OK just
this time) or type 6 important points made in this selection. Also,  
read carefully pages 13-19 and answer (in writing) the questions: What are
some implications of gender? Why is the gender system difficult to  
understand? What are/is the critical problem(s) that complicate restructuring
the gender system? I will collect your notes at the end of class.

Pick a woman from the selections above and write a few sentences about her
everyday life from her perspective or from the perspective of those who made
decisions that impacted her life. For example: You could be an Iroquois woman
and write about your everyday life OR you could be a white woman who
encountered an Iroquois woman and you could write about your perceptions of
her life and her culture. [Other examples: a woman in New Eng.--an African or
a white indentured servant, newly arrived in the Chesapeake---an Algonquin on
the East coast and so on]. Bring these notes to class; I will collect them at

Witch Scare-----Anne Hutchinson was accused around the same time as Roger
Williams. How did gender affect the way he/she were treated? -----You can find
additional information regarding the case discussed in the Dayton essay on the
web. -------On Norton, the subject is  
intersexuality/hermaphroditism-the subjects of much recent scholarship-see if

### Attendance Policy

  
If you miss a fourth of the course (five classes), you will not receive a
passing grade for the  
course.

### Required Text

  
Abrams, M.H., ed. _The Norton Anthology of English Literature: Volume I._ 6th
ed. New York:  
W. W. Norton, 1993.

### Quiz and Test Policy

  
The days on which quizzes and tests will be given are listed below. Unless you
leave a verbal or written message for me with a reasonable excuse (and I am
the judge of how reasonable thex excuse is) before the date of the quiz or
test for why you need to reschedule the quiz or test, you cannot make up the
quiz or test and will receive a grade of zero. Unscheduled quizzes can be made
up by absent students. Final exams can only be rescheduled with permission of
higher authorities, so plan ahead so we can get all the paperwork done to
reschedule the final if necessary. Medical emergencies, car accidents, and
other such rare and extreme situations will be given special consideration.

### Late Paper Policy

  
The following assignments will receive a zero if they are late: preliminary
bibliography, outline of research paper, and the two reports. Exceptions to
this policy are emergencies and personally negotiated extensions. Other
assignments will be accepted up to two weeks late and will lose five points
out of a hundred for lateness. After two weeks, a zero will be entered into
the grade book for work not completed. No work will be accepted after the last
class.

### Paper Policy

  
Follow the directions for each assignment given. Ask questions ahead of time
if you are not sure of the requirements for each assignment and the way in
which each assignment will be evaluated.

### Grade Policy

  
Quizzes and other classwork and homework (average of all of these) 30%  
Midterm 10%  
Final Exam 10%  
Participation in Library and Computer Workshops and class discussions 5%  
Summary and Two Reports 30%

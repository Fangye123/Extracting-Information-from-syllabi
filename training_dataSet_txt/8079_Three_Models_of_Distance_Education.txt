Three Models of Distance Education



Descriptions

Descriptions - Model A - Distributed Classroom
Interactive telecommunications technologies extend a classroom- based
course from one location to a group of students at one or more other locations;
the typical result is an extended "section" that mixes on-site
and distant students. The faculty and institution control the pace and place
of instruction

Descriptions - Model B - Independent Learning
This model frees students from having to be in a particular place at
a particular time. Students are provided a variety of materials, including
a course guide and detailed syllabus, and access to a faculty member who
provides guidance, answers questions, and evaluates their work. Contact
between the individual student and the instructor is achieved by one or
a combination of the following technologies: telephone, voice-mail, computer
conferencing, electronic mail, and regular mail.

Descriptions - Model C - Open Learning + Class
This model involves the use of a printed course guide and other media
(such as videotape or computer disk) to allow the individual student to
study at his or her own pace, combined with occasional use of interactive
telecommunications technologies for group meetings among all enrolled students.

Characteristics

Characteristics - Model A

class sessions involve synchronous communication; students and faculty
  are required to be in a particular place at a particular time (once a week
  at a minimum)
  number of sites varies from two (point-to-point) to five or more (point-to-multipoint);
  the greater the number of sites, the greater the complexity -- technically,
  logistically, and perceptually
  students may enroll at sites more convenient to their homes or work
  locations than the campus
  institutions are able to serve small numbers of students in each location
  the nature of the experience mimics that of the classroom for both
  the instructor and the student


Characteristics - Model B

there are no class sessions; students study independently, following
  the detailed guidelines in the syllabus
  students may interact with the instructor and, in some cases, with
  other students
  presentation of course content is through print, computer disk, or
  videotape, all of which students can review at a place and time of their
  own choosing
  course materials are used over a period of several years, and generally
  are the result of a structured development process that involves instructional
  designers, content experts, and media specialists; not specific to a particular
  instructor


Characteristics - Model C

presentation of course content is through print, computer disk, or
  videotape, all of which students can review at a place and time of their
  own choosing, either individually or in groups
  course materials (for content presentation) are used for more than
  one semester; often specific to the particular instructor (e.g., a videotape
  of the instructor's lectures)
  students come together periodically in groups in specified locations
  for instructor-led class sessions through interactive technologies (following
  the distributed classroom model)
  class sessions are for students to discuss and clarify concepts and
  engage in problem-solving activities, group work, laboratory experiences,
  simulations, and other applied learning exercises.


Faculty Role/Experience

Faculty Role/Experience - Model A

faculty typically do not change their role significantly from the one
  they assume in the traditional classroom; however, the use of technology
  does require adaptability in the manner of presentation
  faculty generally find it necessary to reduce the amount of material
  presented to allow additional time for relational tasks and management
  of the technology; increased familiarity with the technology and the environment
  mitigates this to some extent
  faculty usually find it necessary to increase the amount of planning
  time for each class; advance planning and preparation increases presenter
  self-confidence, reduces unnecessary stress, and enables faculty to conduct
  classes with ease


Faculty Role/Experience - Model B

faculty member structures and facilitates the learning experience,
  but shares control of the process with the student to a great extent
  must become familiar with the content in the print and other materials
  prior to the beginning of the semester to develop the detailed syllabus
  and, if appropriate, plan for effective use of the interactive technologies
  such as computer conferencing and voice-mail
  tutors students one-on-one; faculty member is more available to facilitate
  individual student's learning because of freedom from preparing and delivering
  content for weekly (or more frequent) class sessions


Faculty Role/Experience - Model C

faculty member structures and facilitates the learning experience,
  but shares control of the process with the student to some extent.
  role change encourages faculty to focus on the instructional process
  and to take advantage of the available media
  must become familiar with the content in the print and other materials
  and plan for effective use of the interactive sessions, which draw upon
  these resources
  identifies additional resources to support student learning
  tutors students one-on-one; faculty member is more available to facilitate
  individual student's learning because of freedom from preparing and delivering
  content for weekly (or more frequent) class sessions.


On-Site Students' Experience

On-Site Students' Experience - Model A

because the faculty member is physically present in the space, on-site
  students generally have an experience similar to that of the traditional
  classroom
  may be less tolerant of technological problems and challenges than
  distant students, because they are unlikely to perceive a personal benefit
  resulting from the use of technology
  may resent having to "share" their class with other sites


On-Site Students' Experience - Model B

students to not attend class, which gives them ultimate flexibility
  in structuring their time; they are responsible for organizing their work
  and time to meet course requirements and deadlines
  students must be highly motivated; they need good organizational and
  time management skills, the ability to communicate in writing, initiative,
  and a commitment to high standards of achievement


On-Site Students' Experience - Model C

with fewer class sessions, all students (on-site and distant) gain
  flexibility
  the periodic classes help students to structure their work, but the
  format requires greater discipline and maturity on the part of students
  than one with weekly (or more frequent) class sessions
  interactive focus of group sessions can serve to diminish perceived
  disadvantages of students who are not in the same location as the instructor


Distant Students' Experience

Distant Students' Experience - Model A

tend to feel somewhat isolated and cut off from the "real"
  class unless the faculty member makes a concerted effort to include them
  often form a close working group with students at the same location
  usually find the mediated experience (even two-way video) to be different
  from face-to-face communication because the mediation affects perception
  and communication in some obvious and many subtle ways.
  will make allowances for problems with the technology if they perceive
  a personal benefit (access to instruction otherwise unavailable; site close
  to home or work)

  computer (for e-mail and conferencing; access to library and other
  on-line resources; submission of assignments)


Technologies Supporting Out-of-Class Communication - Model B

  conferencing, and the submission of assignments)


Technologies Supporting Out-of-Class Communication - Model C

telephone
  computer (for access to library and other on-line resources, e- mail,
  conferencing, and for submission of assignments)
  mail


Opportunities for Interaction

Opportunities for Interaction - Model A

all students have opportunity for verbal interaction during class with
  instructor and each other; on-site students have visual interaction with
  instructor and other students in class; off-site students may have opportunity
  for visual interaction with instructor ad other students; depending upon
  technology used
  on-site students can interact with instructor before and after class
  out-of-class interaction by telephone; by computer conferencing, voice-mail,
  or other means if available


Opportunities for Interaction - Model B

instructors provide information in the syllabus about how and when
  students can contact them; there is typically wide variation in the amount
  of student-initiated communication with the instructor
  instructors provide detailed comments on students' written assignments
  when voice-mail and/or computer conferencing is available, instructors
  provide a structure for interactive discussions by posing topics or providing
  some other stimulus for discussion


Opportunities for Interaction - Model C

all class sessions are designed for interaction with instructor and
  other students; they are frequently problem-solving sessions, because the
  time does not have to be devoted to lecture or other mans of presenting
  content
  individual interaction between students and faculty member on an as-needed
  basis by telephone, mail, e-mail, or voice-mail


Support Services Needed

Support Services Needed - Model A

access to technical support at each location; fully trained technician/trouble-shooter
  at origination site
  site assistant at each location to handle logistics and materials distribution/collection
  access to fax machine, telephone, and photocopier


Support Services Needed - Model B

significant administrative structure is crucial to support both the
  students and the instructors
  a system for proctoring exams that retains some measure of flexibility
  for students but meets institutional needs for exam security


Support Services Needed - Model C

access to technical support at each location; fully trained technician/trouble-shooter
  at origination site
  site assistant at each location to handle logistics and materials distribution/collection
  access to fax machine, telephone, and photocopier

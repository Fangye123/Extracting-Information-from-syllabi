Other Than Assignment of Grades \par }\pard \widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1
\par \par I. Introduction \par \par The University of Alaska is committed to
the ideal of academic freedom and so recognizes that academic decisions (i.e.,
non-admission to or dismissal from any UAF program) are a faculty
responsibility. Therefore, the University administration sh all not unduly
influence or affect the review of academic decisions that are a faculty
responsibility. \par \par The following procedures are designed to provide a
means for students to seek review of academic decisions alleged to be
arbitrary and capricious. Befor e taking formal action, a student must attempt
to resolve the issue informally. A student who files a written request for
review under the following procedures shall be expected to abide by the final
disposition of the review, as provided below, and may n ot seek further review
of the matter under any other procedure within the university. \par \par \par
II. Definitions \par \par }\pard \fi-360\li360\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1
A. As used in the schedule for review of academic decisions, a class day is
any day of scheduled instruction, excluding Saturday and Sunday, included on
the academic calendar in effect at the time of a review. Final examination
periods are counted as class days. \par \par B. "Department Chair" for the
purposes of this policy denotes the administrative head of the academic unit
offering the course (e.g., head, c hair or coordinator of an academic
department, or division coordinator or program chair if the faculty member is
in the College of Rural Alaska). \par \par C. The "dean/director" is the
administrative head of the college or school offering the course or program fr
om which the academic decision or action arises. For students at extended
campuses the director of the campus may substitute for the dean/director of
the unit offering the course or program. \par \par D. The next regular
semester is the fall or spring semester fol lowing that in which the disputed
academic decision was made. For example, it would be the fall semester for a
final grade issued for a course completed during the previous spring semester
or summer session. The spring semester is the next regular semes ter for an
academic decision made during the previous fall semester. \par }\pard
\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 \par \par III. Procedures \par \par }\pard
\fi-360\li360\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 A. A student wishing to appeal
an academic decision other than a grade assignment must first request an
informal review of the decision. \par }\pard \li720\widctlpar\adjustright
{\f20\cf1 \par }\pard \fi-360\li720\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 1.
Notification must be received by the Provost within 15 days from the first day
of instruction of the semester in which the decision takes effect. \par \par
2. There may be extenuating circumstances when the deadlines cannot be met due
to illness, mail disruption, or other situations over which the student may
have no control. In such a case, upon request from the student, the Provost,
after review of supporting documentation provided by the student, may adjust
the deadlines accordingly. An extension of the deadline will be limited to one
semester but every effort should be made to complete the appeal process within
the current semester. \par \par 3. The Provost will request the appropriate
department chair to conduct an informal review of the decision. The Department
chair will determine whether th e original decision should be overturned or
changed in any way. The department chair will submit his/her recommendation to
the provost through the dean/director within 10 days. In the event that the
department chair is directly involved, the provost can a sk the dean/director
to conduct an informal review and submit his/her recommendations directly to
him. \par \par 4. The Provost will consult with the student on the department
chair's recommendation. If the student does not find that recommendation
acceptable, he/she may request the Provost to conduct a formal review. \par
}\pard \li720\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 \par }\pard
\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 B. The formal review will be conducted as
follows. \par \par }\pard \fi-360\li720\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 1.
This formal review is initiated by the student through a signed, written
request to the Provost. \par }\pard \li720\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1
\par }\pard \fi-360\li1080\widctlpar\adjustright {\f20\cf1 a. The student's
request for formal review may be submitted using university forms specifically
designed for this purpose and available from the Office of the Provost. \par
\par b. By submitting a request for a review, the student acknowledges that no
additional mechanisms exist within the university for the formal review of the
decision, and that the university's administration including the college
dean/director can not influence or affect the outcome of the formal review.
\par \par c. The request for a formal review must be received no later than 10
days after the student has learned the outcome of the informal review (IIIA4).
\par \par d. The request must detail the basis for the allegation that the
decision was made on a basis other than sound professional judgment based upon
standard academic policies, procedures and practices. \par }\pard

\par \par The University of Alaska is committed to the ideal of academ ic
freedom and so recognizes that the assignment of grades is a faculty
responsibility. Therefore, the University administration shall not influence
or affect an assigned grade or the review of an assigned grade. \par \par The
following procedures are designed to provide a means for students to seek
review of final course grades alleged to be arbitrary and capricious. Before
taking formal action, a student must attempt to resolve the issue informally
with the instructor of the course. A student who files a writ ten request for
review under the following procedures shall be expected to abide by the final
disposition of the review, as provided below, and may not seek further review
of the matter under any other procedure within the university. \par \par \par

 _Methodology_ : A theoretical framework for implementation of information
systems will be provided through reading and discussing the text. In general,
the lecture will follow the course outline and the text presentation. The
instructor will utilize additional information, as required, to supplement the
text.

Discussions will include the impact computers have on business and society.
How the use of computers to store vast amounts of data can be a threat to
individual privacy and a stimulus for illegal and unethical use.

Systems design will be introduced to the student by the use of exercises in
designing a simple information system using the Web and the Access database
software. An Access assignment will also be part of the MIS300 Lab. All
students in MIS 300 must be registered for a section of the lab. _You must
pass the lab to pass the class._

_Assignments_ : Text material and topics are assigned on the attached
schedule. The student should read the assignment prior to class because the
lecture will be used to clarify difficult material. Questions and other
material at the end of the assigned chapters are to be included in the
readings. Any changes to the schedule and homework assignments will be given
in class. _If you must miss class for any reason, it is your responsibility to
get the notes and find out what you missed_.

_Exams_ : Materials included in the exams will be taken from the text and
class lecture/discussions. Exams will be administered on the dates scheduled.
Students are not permitted to retain these exams. The tests will be multiple
choice. .  The five exams will comprise 75% of your grade.  Unannounced
quizzes may be given during the quarter.  They will be counted as part of the

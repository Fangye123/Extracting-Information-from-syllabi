PS154 Politics of East Asia

**Course Description:** This course is designed to familiarize students with
domestic politics and regional rivalry in East Asia, with a heavier emphasis
on China. The course will focus on the following two issue areas: (1)
democratization and electoral politics; (2) security challenges and changing
national interests in the post-cold war Pacific. The course will combine
lectures with in-class presentations.

**Grading** : Short reports on guest lectures, 20%: You are required to attend
occasional guest lectures (about 3 lectures) related to our course and write a
3-5 page double-spaced, typewritten summary and critique on each guest
lecture. This will be worth 20% of your final course grade. Information about
the guest lectures will be announced in class and through emails.

First term paper, 40%: Topics of the first term paper must be related to
China. You are encouraged to meet with me to discuss the topic, scope, and
outline of your paper. Due date for the midterm paper will be announced in
class, most likely around the end of October.

Second term paper, 40%: Topics of the second term paper should be primarily on
a topic related to Japan, North/South Korea, Taiwan, or Hong Kong. This paper
is due December 16, 2000.

**Readings:** Given the broad scope of this course and the dynamic nature of
the region, I will assign mostly journal articles instead of books as required
readings. I will substitute or add new journal articles to the list of
readings as they become available. Weekly reading materials will be handed out
in class at least one week in advance. An experimental website has been
created to enhance your access to information related to our course,
<http://www.duke.edu/web/cis/pass/course>. We will work together to improve
this website. So your inputs in the design and content of this website will be
greatly appreciated.

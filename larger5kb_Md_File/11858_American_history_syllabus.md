**Overview:  **  
This course is a general survey of American History since 1877. Our focus this
semester will be on the relationship between political ideas and social
change.

**Class Sessions and Readings:**  
Class sessions will include lectures and class discussions based on the
readings. The required readings include a course packet of primary sources,
and the following books:

James L. Roark, et al., _The American Promise, vol. II  _  
Ida B. Wells, _Southern Horrors and Other Writings_  
Henry (Yoshitaka) Kiyama, _The Four Immigrants Manga_  
Tom Wolfe, _Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers_  
  
---  
  
**Grading:**  
You are required to take the midterm and the final examination, which together
will count for 40% of your total grade for the course. The remaining 60% of
your course grade will be made up of some combination of  papers and quizzes.
There are three different grading options. You do not have to decide right
away; at the end of the semester I will calculate your grade in whatever way
would be most advantageous to you.

The following tables show the three possibilities for how your grade will be
calculated.

> _Emphasis on Testing (One paper; eight quizzes)_ :

| Eight best quizzes:  | 40% (5% each)  
---|---  
One best paper (5-6 pages): | 20%  
Midterm: | 15%  
Final Exam: | 25%  
TOTAL: | 100%  
Participation: | Extra credit  
  
> _The Happy Medium (Two papers, four quizzes)_ :

Four best quizzes | 20% (5% each)  
---|---  
Two best papers (5-6 pages): | 40% (20% each)  
Midterm: | 15%  
Final Exam: | 25%  
TOTAL: | 100%  
Participation: | Extra credit  
  
>  
> _Emphasis on Writing (Three papers, no quizzes)_ :

Three best papers (5-6 pages): | 60% (20% each)  
---|---  
Midterm: | 15%  
Final Exam: | 25%  
TOTAL: | 100%  
Participation: | Extra credit  
  
Regardless of which option you choose, you will have the flexibility to choose
your papers from among six possible assignments, listed briefly in the
schedule below. Students who take the quizzes may choose from among ten
possible quizzes.  
  
  
**Format of Tests:**  
The _midterm and the final examination_ will consist of a mix of essays and
"long identification" answers. The essays will each draw on a range of
material presented in the lectures, textbook, and assigned readings. The long
identification questions will ask you to identify a term and discuss its
significance in American history.

The _weekly quizzes_ will be held at the end in the last 20 minutes of a class
session, usually on Wednesdays. Students who do not wish to take the quiz
should feel free to leave at that point. The quizzes will consist of short
factual questions, based mainly on the lectures and textbook.  
  
  
**Standards for Grading Papers:**

A = Work of exceptionally high quality. An "A" paper demonstrates unusually
thorough and insightful understanding of the readings in the context of their
time. An "A" paper presents a specific and clearly identifiable thesis in the
introduction. It is organized into coherent and well-written paragraphs. It
provides ample supporting evidence and is attentive to nuance. It is free of
major errors in grammar and spelling.

B = Work of good quality.  A "B" paper demonstrates a clear and accurate
understanding of the readings. A "B" paper presents a clearly identifiable
thesis and argument with adequate supporting evidence. The paper provides
sufficient historical context. The paper is organized into coherent paragraphs
and complete sentences.

C = Work that meets the requirements of the assignment, but is not
particularly impressive. A "C" paper has some point and organization, but
develops the argument in a superficial, incomplete or simplistic manner.
Alternatively, a "C" paper presents a clear argument but falls short of "B"
status for one of the following reasons: it provides insufficient historical
context, it shows an incomplete understanding of the readings, it is poorly
organized, or it is poorly written.

D = Work of poor quality that does not meet the minimal requirements of the
assignment. A "D" paper lacks a thesis, lacks supporting evidence, is an
unusually bad piece of writing, or shows that the student failed to understand
the readings.

F = An "F" paper shows that the student is ignorant of the content of the
readings, or that the student plagiarized. (Serious cases of plagiarism will
also result in a failing grade for the course).  
  
  
**Requirements and Expectations:**

> 1) All students are required to submit their written work on time. Students
who encounter an emergency that prevents them from submitting a paper on time
are required to discuss the matter with me in advance, if at all possible, or
to notify me by voice mail (486-3854). Students who submit late work without
advance permission will be penalized. For each weekday that a paper is late,
the grade will be reduced by a third of a grade (for instance from an A- to a
B+). No papers will be accepted more than a week late without prior
arrangement.

> 2) All papers must be submitted to me in person (not by e-mail or in my
mailbox), except by special arrangement.

>

> 3) Daily attendance is strongly encouraged. Students are expected to keep up
with the material presented in class regardless of whether they miss a day. If
you know ahead of time that you will be absent, it is a good idea to arrange
with someone else to take notes.

> 4) Students are expected to participate regularly, actively, and
constructively in class discussions. Students will receive extra credit for
class participation only if they express informed judgments, pose questions,
and respond to other students' comments. Students who rarely speak, or who
show a lack of familiarity with the material, will not receive any credit.

> 5) Punctuality is important and expected. By arriving late, you cause a
minor distraction for everybody. By doing so repeatedly, or by leaving before
the end of class without notifying me in advance, you are likely to annoy me.

>

> 6) Please don't wander out for a "break" during class. It's distracting.

> 7) Drinks are OK, but no eating in class.

> 8) Students are expected to behave themselves in a way that shows courtesy
to the instructors and to fellow students. They are expected to be attentive
and respectful. Language or behavior that demeans or harasses other students
will not be tolerated; this includes sexual harassment.

>

> 9) [Plagiarism](http://VM.UCONN.EDU/%7EPBALDWIN/cheat.html) and cheating
will not be tolerated.  Plagiarism is the use of the ideas, organization, or
words of another writer without giving proper credit. Students must produce
their own, original work for this course. All students must pass the
plagiarism test before submitting any written work. Any student found to have
committed a serious act of plagiarism will fail the course. This rule is
supported by the policy on academic integrity in the University of
Connecticut's student code. I take this requirement very seriously and I
actively hunt for plagiarism. If I catch you, I will not care about any
excuses you may have. Don't plagiarize! It's not worth the risk.

>

>> Here is the policy on academic integrity in the University of Connecticut's
student code:

>>

>>    A fundamental tenet of all educational institutions is academic honesty;
academic work depends upon respect for and acknowledgement of the research and
ideas of others. Misrepresenting someone else's work as one's own is a serious
offense in any academic setting and it will not be condoned.  
>    Academic misconduct includes, but is not limited to, providing or
receiving assistance in a manner not authorized by the instructor in the
creation of work to be submitted for academic evaluation (e.g. papers,
projects, and examinations); any attempt to influence improperly (e.g.
bribery, threats) any member of the faculty, staff, or administration of the
University in any matter pertaining to academics or research; presenting, as
one's own, the ideas or words of another for academic evaluation; doing
unauthorized academic work for which another person will receive credit or be
evaluated; and presenting the same or substantially the same papers or
projects in two or more courses without the explicit permission of the
instructors involved.  
>   A student who knowingly assists another student in committing an act of
academic misconduct shall be equally accountable for the violation, and shall
be subject to the sanctions and other remedies described in The Student Code.

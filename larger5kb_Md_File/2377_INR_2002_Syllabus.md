**Course Description:** This course is an introduction to international
relations. We will survey the changes that led to the collapse of the Soviet
Union after 1989. We'll examine opinions about what power is and how it ought
to be used in this new environment. We'll study the most important sources of
power and conflict. We'll look at the role of international organization and
law in international relations as well as the North-South division in wealth
and power. We'll discuss international trade and economic development issues
as we approach the 21st century. We'll develop map/geography skills.  
---  
**Catalogue Description:** This course explores the nature of international
relations, its history, the causes of leading political and economic problems
and the efforts to remedy them. It examines the foreign policies of the major
countries, the causes of war and peace, as well as international
organizations, and major global issues, including globalization, integration,
migration, poverty, environmental concerns, and the impact of technology on
global affairs.

We'll use every tool in the teaching bag of tricks to learn: traditional as
well as computer based instruction, simulations, discussion, etc. We will
stress your using the internet: to connect you with the world, and develop
your electronic communication skills for a lifetime of distance learning, and
to build a sense of community among ourselves.  
  
**Prerequisites and Co-requisites** : None  
  
####  Textbook: Goldstein, Joshua. _International Relations 4th edition._

Although it is not required to do so, students are strongly encouraged to read
a good daily newspaper so they can follow the examples used in the lectures.
The two best daily newspapers in the United States, the [New York
Times](http://www.times.com) (http://www.times.com) and [Washington
Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com) (http://www.washingtonpost.com) are
available online at no charge. The student rate of 50% off the regular price
for home delivery of the N.Y. Times is available to you by calling
1.800.NYTIMES and identifying yourself as my student.  
  
**Tools**

Computers will be an active part of the course. At a minimum you must be able
to operate and understand a Web browser.  Your computer should have a good
virus checker and at least a 28,800 bps modem.   Please note: unfortunately
AOL does not get along well with WebCT, the Web application used for this
course. You should use Netscape or MS Internet Explorer.  If you need
assistance with downloading and installing one of these free browsers, contact
[Lloyd Hollingsworth](mailto:lholling@mdcc.edu), Virtual College Technical
Support at (305)237-4222.  
  
**Course Policies:**

  * You are responsible for learning approximately 45 pages a week in your textbook, exploration and discussion, mini projects, Web participation, and online activities.


  * The level of success that you wish to achieve is possible in this class. It requires however that you commit to being an active participant. You must devote adequate time to your reading, complete your required assignments accurately and on time, and study. Participate by using our Web site, asking meaningful questions, forming a study group, and participating in collaborative group assignments. Ask questions, seek help, put forth your maximum effort and you will inevitably reap the benefits. Check out the course requirements.  


  * **Review course calendar and assignments to be familiar with our plan of study.  
**

  * It is your responsibility to ensure that you are properly registered or withdrawn from this course via the Registrar by the proper dates.  


  * I do not keep any reports, tests, or other items you turn in for more than four weeks into the next term.


  * Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Students involved in any form of academic dishonesty (cheating, plagiarism, etc.), will receive a grade of **"F"** for the course.

  
**General Criteria for Grading:** (See requirements for specifics)

  * Students who get top grades (A, B+) generally:  


    * are self disciplined, self starters and stick to deadlines. They set high standards for themselves and realistically take time needed to reach their goals  

    * review carefully and productively, do not fall behind, participate actively and enthusiastically in discussions   

    * in general, spend 3-4 hours learning a chapter and 2-3 hours preparing other materials and online  

    * ask questions on a regular basis, and readily share ideas. They tend to write fairly well, and support their ideas with good examples. They also aren't afraid to ask questions when they feel lost or "ignorant." I recognize that not everyone is a "international relations junkie." (Incidentally, they also frequently report to their teacher about what's working for them in the course and what might work better for them...helping to make the course much better for everyone)  

    * take all practice quizzes, print out and use study guides  

    * challenge conventional wisdom, think for themselves, try looking beyond the clich¨¦   

    * regularly read magazines or newspapers. For good background reading, try [The Economist](http://economist.com/). This reflects in their discussions, participation, and other written work such as postings, chapter reviews, etc.  

    * Turn in high-quality written work which reflects reading, research, well-conceived arguments, originality, clarity of thought, and integration of course material. They stay within stated page limits. Their bibliographies are solid and their footnotes carefully used. Their papers are typed and readable. Written work is in nearly flawless English grammar and spelling.


  * Students who get middle grades (B, C+) generally :  

    * Are not as conscientious about reading ahead, and reviewing the work. Spend maybe three hours a chapter, and occasionally take practice quizzes.   

    * Occasionally read a paper  

    * Turn in acceptable written work, with no serious deficiencies in writing. They meet deadlines generally. Their work is readable and typed  

    * They complete assigned readings and participate in discussions, asking occasional questions  

  * Students who get low and failing grades (C, D, F) generally:   

    * get off to a bad start. They don't read the chapters ahead, don't go to and use the Web site regularly. Then, they complete only part of their readings, rely too much on chapter summaries, do not take practice quizzes, do not bother to answer study guide questions with more than they from class or from the Web site, cram, and in general do not devote the 3-4 hours that it takes to learn each chapter well. They do not take full advantage of computers  

    * often make excuses such as that they "do not have time" , therefore they do not participate in discussions, take practice quizzes or use the other tools that will help them learn and add to their grade  

    * don't contact the teacher when they run into problems. Please do remember, I do care about your progress. I am here to help. Don't ever be reluctant to talk to me and ask for help. Any student receiving a D or F on a test must schedule an appointment with me  

    * when called upon, are obviously not familiar with the material. They ask no questions and accept new ideas and opinions without challenging them  

    * when they read a paper, the closest they get to reading about politics is the sports page  

    * do not turn in their assigned work, or turn it in late with penalty  

    * turn in poor quality work that shows inadequate reading, documentation, thought and originality

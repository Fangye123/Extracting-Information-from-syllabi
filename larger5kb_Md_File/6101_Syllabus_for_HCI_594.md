#### Prerequisites

HCI 430, HCI 440 and HCI 460.

#### Overview

Students build and reflect upon skills, methods and techniques learned in
previous HCI courses. Course meetings generally involve discussing and
critiquing ideas and methods from assigned readings. The course project
involves applying a set of ideas and methods discussed in class and evaluating
their effectiveness. Students may choose their projects with the advice and
consent of the instructor.

#### Goals

Overall, the goal is to learn how to investigate and apply new ideas in human-
computer interaction. This includes the following:

  * Reading about new HCI methods and evaluating them
  * Learning how to apply new HCI methods
  * Experimentally evaluating methods
  * Discussing and presenting research results

#### Grade Determination

40% (80 points)  | Summaries of assigned readings (best 8 out of 9)  
---|---  
10% (20 points)  |  Project proposal  
10% (20 points)  |  Draft of project draft  
10% (20 points)  |  Project presentation  
30% (60 points) |  Final project report  
  
Students receiving more than 90% of possible points are guaranteed at least an
A-, more than 80% at least a B-, more than 70% at least a C-, and more than
60% at least a D.

Reading summaries are 1 to 2 page reports that highlight the main ideas of the
assigned readings. Students are also expected to discuss the contents of their
summaries during class. Turning in a summary without attending class will
receive half the credit. We will discuss what constitutes a good summary on
the first day of class. Reading summaries must be ready to be turned in before
the beginning of class. Late summaries will not be accepted.

The course project may be done individually or with one additional person.
Reciprocally assisting in other projects is encouraged but should not include
analyzing results and writing reports. Late projects will be accepted without
penalty until 2pm the day following the due date. Projects turned in later
than 2pm the day following the due date will not be accepted.

#### University Policies

**Plagiarism:** The university and school policy on plagiarism can be
summarized as follows: Students in this course, as well as all other courses
in which independent research or writing play a vital part in the course
requirements, should be aware of the strong sanctions that can be imposed
against someone guilty of plagiarism. If proven, a charge of plagiarism could
result in an automatic F in the course and possible expulsion. The strongest
of sanctions will be imposed on anyone who submits as his/her own work a
report, examination paper, computer file, lab report, or other assignment
which has been prepared by someone else. If you have any questions or doubts
about what plagiarism entails or how to properly acknowledge source materials
be sure to consult the instructor.

**Incomplete:** An incomplete grade is given only for an exceptional reason
such as a death in the family, a serious illness, etc. Any such reason must be
documented. Any incomplete request must be made at least two weeks before the
final, and approved by the Dean of the School of Computer Science,
Telecommunications and Information Systems. Any consequences resulting from a
poor grade for the course will not be considered as valid reasons for such a
request.

#### **_Course Description:_**

         In the original sense of the word, the humanities are the educational disciplines that foster `humanitas', i.e. activate all of the faculties of an individual - emotional, intellectual, social and spiritual - and make the individual into a fully-functioning person. More concretely, the humanities are those nonscientific, nonvocational subjects that lie at the heart of our Western cultural legacy: literature, history, philosophy, religion, and the arts. 

The General Education sequence Humanities I-II (with dividing line between the
two segments at ca. 1600) constitutes an introduction to the Western heritage,
i.e., the history of European civilization and its greatest cultural
achievements. Specifically, its goals are to provide students with an
understanding of the development of Western history from its beginning to the
present, an acquaintance with some of the finest examples of the West's
creative products, and an initiation into the West's tradition of both
personal and collective self-examination.

The instructor hopes to help students to appreciate some of the great works of
literature, philosophy and political theory written during this period, and to
show students the perennial significance of the issues these works address.

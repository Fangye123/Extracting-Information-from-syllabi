**Course Description:**

Exploration of the unique nature and continuing significance of Greek tragedy
and Greek theater in the drama of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides.

LEARNING OUTCOMES:

1\. increased knowledge of cultural history through understanding and
appreciation of the remarkable achievement of the classical Athenians in the
field of tragic drama

2\. understanding of Greek tragedy as a form of aesthetic expression (in
itself and in relation to other aesthetic forms)

3\. ability to analyze, evaluate, and compare the tragic visions of Aeschylus,
Sophocles, and Euripides as an illustration of the way different authors,
working within the same genre and traditions, can convey very individual and
personal visions of life

4\. ability to analyze the presentation of women on the Greek tragic stage in
the light of the social, political, and economic status of the actual women of
classical Athens as an illustration of literature's relation to its social and
cultural background

5\. understanding and appreciation of Greek tragedy in universal and
contemporary terms as an illustration of the way in which art rises above the
time and place which produced it

METHODS:

1\. Slide presentations and lectures on background (origin and development of
Greek tragedy, ancient theatre and dramatic conventions, Aristotle's Poetics,
etc.)

2\. Class viewing and discussion of excerpts from videotaped productions of
several tragedies.

3\. The majority of class time will be devoted to discussion and analysis of
the assigned plays.

**Student Responsibilities:**

  * **Class Attendance:  
** The student is expected to [attend every class session](tips.html). The
requirement of attendance is not frivolous, but recognizes that classroom
activities, i.e. certain lectures by the professor, discussion and questions,
are valuable to your education.

  * **Preparation for Class:  
** Thoughtful reading and analysis of all assigned plays. Active participation
in class discussions of the plays.

  * **Grading Criteria:**  
There will be three examinations equally weighted worth 25 points each, for a
cumulative total of 75 points. In addition a creative project will be
assigned, worth 25 points (see below). The exams will include short slide
identifications and an essay.

**Exam Policy:**

Make-up exams will only be administered under dire necessity, and must always
be arranged before the test by calling my office (202-806-5220) and leaving a
message if I am not there. This is not to be used for lack of preparation or
sleep: only for serious emergencies. The make-up exams are always harder.
Please see the student handbook and catalog for policies on plagiarism and
cheating. They will not be tolerated in this class.

#### Description of Creative Project:

Choose one of the plays studied in the course that you think would be
particularly appealing and meaningful to a modern audience at Howard
University. Take the role of producer of a contemporary performance of this
play, assuming that money is no object. On April 24, submit a three page
letter wooing financial backers for your production, explaining why you have
chosen this particular play and dealing with such matters as theme and
universal meaning. Explain your overall vision for this production and why you
think this way of presenting the play will be especially attractive and
meaningful for today's audiences.

See these [useful links for the Creative Project](cp.html) before you begin to
write.

Con-vocatio is a Latin term meaning "calling us to begin working together" and
is one of the last rituals based on Roman traditions- see the faculty in their
medieval robes called "regalia", another Latin term meaning "clothing
associated with royalty"; the procession itself is reminiscent of ancient
Roman senators. Enjoy the spectacle!

#### The Learning Environment:

To help you gain skills and insights, we will have many different kinds of
exercises and assignments during the class period designed to lead you down
the path towards understanding. Much of the work in class will be group
oriented and discussion based; if you are looking for a traditional lecture
course, this is probably not the right course for you.

I will try to create a classroom atmosphere with these characteristics, and
hope that you will support me in this:  

1\. Prevalence of a warm, accepting, nonthreatening group climate.  
2\. Learning is approached as a cooperative enterprise.  
3\. Learning is accepted as the raison d'etre of the group.  
4\. Everyone participates and interacts.  
5\. Leadership functions are distributed.  
6\. Group sessions and the learning task are enjoyable.  
7\. The material is adequately and efficiently covered.  
8\. Members attend regularly and come prepared.  
---  
  
All members have the following responsibilities within group work:  

1\. Be a good listener.  
2\. Restate in your own words what others have said.  
3\. Sponsor other members.  
4\. Give encouragement and approval.  
5\. Formulate and cite examples.  
6\. Ask questions.  
**Statement on Liberal Learning**

A truly liberal education is one that prepares us to live responsible,
productive, and creative lives in a dramatically changing world. It is an
education that fosters a well-grounded intellectual resilience, a disposition
toward lifelong learning, and an acceptance of responsibility for the ethical
consequences of our ideas and actions. Liberal education requires that we
understand the foundations of knowledge and inquiry about nature, culture and
society; that we master core skills of perception, analysis, and expression;
that we cultivate a respect for truth; that we recognize the importance of
historical and cultural context; and that we explore connections among formal
learning, citizenship, and service to our communities.

We experience the benefits of liberal learning by pursuing intellectual work
that is honest, challenging, and significant, and by preparing ourselves to
use knowledge and power in responsible ways. Liberal learning is not confined
to particular fields of study. What matters in liberal education is
substantial content, rigorous methodology and an active engagement with the
societal, ethical, and practical implications of our learning. The spirit and
value of liberal learning are equally relevant to all forms of higher
education and to all students.

Because liberal learning aims to free us from the constraints of ignorance,
sectarianism, and myopia, it prizes curiosity and seeks to expand the
boundaries of human knowledge. By its nature, therefore, liberal learning is
global and pluralistic. It embraces the diversity of ideas and experiences
that characterize the social, natural, and intellectual world. To acknowledge
such diversity in all its forms is both an intellectual commitment and a
social responsibility, for nothing less will equip us to understand our world
and to pursue fruitful lives.

The ability to think, to learn, and to express oneself both rigorously and
creatively, the capacity to understand ideas and issues in context, the
commitment to live in society, and the yearning for truth are fundamental
features of our humanity. In centering education upon these qualities, liberal
learning is society's best investment in our shared future.

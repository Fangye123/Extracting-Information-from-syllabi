**What is this Course?**

Linguistics 210, Native Languages of North America, is a general survey course
on Native American languages. The course proposes to give insight into the
background, both historical and contemporary, on various American Indian
linguistic communities. The first part of the course addresses the basic
topics of phonology, morphology, syntax, and classification of various
American Indian languages. In the second part of the course, other topics will
be addressed, such as contemporary issues in the areas of language
maintenance, language policy, language and literature, and writing systems.

**Course Requirements**

This course satisfies the General Education Requirement for Individuals,
Societies, and Institutions. It is also a Tier 2 Core Course. As a Tier 2
course, it will be highly interdisciplinary. Tier 2 courses have a significant
writing requirement. This requirement will be met in at least three ways in
this course: exams will have some essay type questions; much of the homework
will require written responses/answers; and there is an 8-page term paper that
is due at the end of the semester.

General education programs provide breadth of knowledge as a balance and
complement to the depth provided by the major. General education is designed
to accomplish several goals: first, to afford students the opportunity to
learn how different disciplines define, acquire and organize knowledge;
second, to provide a basis for an examination of values; third, to develop
analytic, synthetic, linguistic and computational skills useful for lifelong
learning; and finally, to provide a common foundation for wide-ranging
dialogue with peers on issues of significance. Taken together, the experiences
of general education encourage the student to develop a critical and inquiring
attitude, an appreciation of complexity and ambiguity, a tolerance for and
empathy with persons of different backgrounds or values and a deepened sense
of self. In short, the goal of the general education program is to prepare
students to respond more fully and effectively to an increasingly complex
world.

**Readings:**  
  
     The following are the readings for this course. The student is responsible for all the material assigned in the required readings.   
  

**Required:**  
  
    _An Introduction to Native North America_ , Mark Q. Sutton (Sutton)     _Flutes of Fire_ , Leanne Hinton (Hinton)     Packet available later in the semester  
  
**Recommended:**  
  
    _American Indian Languages_ , Shirley Silver and Wick Miller.     _Indigenous Language Use and Change in the Americas_ , Teresa L. McCarty and Ofelia Zepeda 

**Grading:**  
  
    

The final grade will be based on your scores in the following sections:  
  
     Homework: 20%      Term Paper: 25%     Midterm: 20%     Final: 30%     Participation: 5% 

**Homework:**

The homework will be handed out on Wednesday and due back the following Monday
before lecture. There will be no late submissions of homework, unless prior
arrangements have been made with either the instructor or the teaching
assistants. In general, homework will be graded on a 10-point scale, and the
total number of points will be adjusted to 20% of the value of the final
grade. Homework must be typed or word-processed, unless the instructor or
teaching assistants (TAs) state otherwise.

**Term Paper:**

The term paper for this course will be graded in three parts: topic statement,
rough draft, and final paper. Each of these three parts contributes to the 25
points listed above. As with the homework, each of the three parts are due on
the date listed, unless prior arrangments have been made.  

**Topic Statement:**      The topic statement will consist of a paragraph
detailing the topic of the paper, and a copy of the first page of two
different sources that you intend to use for the paper. The topic statement
will be due on Feb. 14, before lecture. The topic statements will be returned
with comments. **Rough Draft:**      The rough draft will consist of a typed
or word-processed early version of the final paper. This will be turned in on
Mar. 20, before lecture. The rough drafts will be returned with comments.
**Final Paper:**      Due Apr. 24, before lecture. The rough draft must be
submitted with the final paper. A student will not receive full credit for the
final paper if the rough draft is not re-submitted. Final papers must be typed
or word-processed and be 8 pages minimum in length.

**Participation:**

The participation part of a student's final score is based on general
attendance and participation. This will be evaluated by section attendance and
in-class writing assignments.

**Availability:**

The instructor and TAs will be available during their office hours, as
outlined above, or by appointment. However, there are other ways to
communicate with the 210 staff. One such way is by phone. Another way is to
leave a message with the reception desk in the Linguistics department.

And then there is email. Students may contact the staff by email, and a
mailing list will be set up so that students may contact each other. If you
don't have email, you are required to get an account set up. All registered
students at the University of Arizona are entitled to such an email account.
If you do not know how to set up an account, let either the instructor or your
TA know, and assistance will be provided.

**Classroom Conduct:**

Disruptive behavior will not be tolerated in the classroom. If a student is
being disruptive, the student will be warned verbally. If the behavior
continues, the instructor will issue a written warning to the student. If the
behavior continues after the written warning is issued, the student's name
will be referred to the Dean of Student Affairs. Beepers, watch alarms and
portable phones must be turned off during class. If such instruments go off in
class this is considered disruptive behavior.

> ###  Course Description

>

>     This course will provide you with a broad introduction to the field of
psychology, one of the social sciences. Among the topics we will cover are:
gathering data on the causes and correlates of behavior, key figures in
psychology and their theories, examples of research findings from the major
subareas of the field, and using psychological knowledge to improve the
quality of our lives. This survey of psychology will acquaint you with the
major concepts and terminology of the discipline and give you a better
understanding of self and others. We'll use a combination of lectures (oh
boy!), video clips, demonstrations and games (volunteers needed!), and
miscellaneous experiences (be on guard!). I hope it will make you want to
learn more about psychology and have you asking "What's the evidence?" each
time you encounter statements about behavior. Last of all, it should be fun
and interesting!

> **Welcome to Psychology** and the start of a new semester!!  Welcome to
Psychology!!   And, if any of you are new to campus -- welcome to UNI as well!
I am hoping we will have a great semester together. Most of you are are in the
second half of your first year. I hope you all had a successful first
semester. But if not, take heart - for many students second semester is a
dramatic improvement over the first. Learn from your mistakes and make a fresh
start!

>

>     I think _Introduction   to Psychology_ is a great course for any student
to take. I would recommend it even if a student had already completed the
General Education requirements. All of us can benefit from a better
understanding of the causes of behavior as we go through life trying to make
sense of our own behavior or that of friends, family, lovers, co-workers,
politicians - whoever! Everyone needs to be able to critically evaluate the
claims concerning behavior that are so much a part of news reports,
commercials, and conversation. This course will help you with each of these.
Many of you, raising children \- now or in the future, will be better prepared
with some understanding of developmental psychology. And all of you, in one
way or another, will cross paths with someone in the mental health field.
Perhaps you already have, in school (counselors, school psychologists). Recent
statistics suggest that 1 out of 2 Americans will suffer from some sort of
psychological disorder in their lifetime. You or someone you care about is
likely to seek out some type of mental health treatment or advice. Or you may
hear testimony from someone in this field while on jury duty. This course will
help you understand the qualifications of and differences among professionals
in the field. In addition, about 1 out of 5 Americans will have some kind of
nervous system disorder or disease which affects behavior. Biopsychology, the
study of brain/behavior relationships, can help you understand what is
happening when someone you know is affected by autism or Alzheimer's disease
or other neurological problem. But psychology is not only concerned with
treating behavioral problems. A good part of it is focussed on simply
improving the quality of life and our ability to function in a wide variety of
circumstances (education, work, relationships, etc.). You can use what you
learn to improve your life!

>

>     Now I know you may have your doubts about a class this size. It is easy
to feel lost in the crowd, to think your attendance is not important, and to
assume you are on your own if you start to have problems. That is not the case
here!  I may not learn to associate many faces with names, but I do care about
how you are doing, I applaud your improvements, and enjoy getting to know as
many of you as I can. I welcome office visits and e-mail and I'm almost always
available before and after class as well. I will do what I can to make our
class a comfortable place so you feel free to speak up. (Remember - nearly
everyone here is just as new and as anxious as you. I welcome questions and
its your chance to slow down my motor mouth!  **: )** ). Fight passivity!
Let's make it feel like a smaller class. Become _involved_ and you will have
much better retention of the material. You'll get so much more out of college
if you are not just a listener! Remember Robin Williams in "Dead Poet's
Society"? "Carpe diem!" (Seize the day - or, in this case, seize your
education!). [Dream Big!](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/big.html)

>

>     While I feel like we can work together to make even our huge class a
friendly and involving place, one thing that's more difficult to do is to
design a course that "fits" all 200+ students. If this class is like most
others, about half of you have already had a psych class in high school, while
about half are brand new to the subject. Some who took high school psych had
excellent courses that were the equivalent of a college course (although often
spread over a whole school year), whereas others took a course that only
covered a small amount of the content we will be tackling this semester. What
this means is that inevitably sometimes we are going too slow or too shallow
for more experienced students or too fast and furious for others. Some
students who got by  with memorizing definitions in high school may find test
questions that ask you to apply your understanding to real-life situations
pretty challenging, while others will find our multiple choice tests too
simplistic. Realizing these difficulties I can only say I will try to teach an
understandable, yet challenging course suited both for those who may never
take another psych class in their lives and those who may go on to major or
minor in psychology.

>

>     Many large lectures classes at UNI or across the country take the
lecture and 2 to 4 exams approach. While that is traditional and easy on the
instructor and some of the students (good test-takers), it is not good for
many students and often does not promote good learning and long-term
retention. Listening and reading just aren't enough for most of us to really
learn new material \- we have to work with information to make it our own.
Research has shown that actively engaging the material improves learning and
retention. For that reason I have planned several small assignments during the
semester related to the concepts we are covering. Since you can use your text
and other resources, discuss assignments with friends, or consult with your
prof or T.A.'s, your assignment points should be more clearly under your
control than test points. Almost all past students voted in favor of having
some of the course points come from something other than exams. Last semester
the points from the assignments allowed almost all students to significantly
raise their grade above that which they would have earned from test scores
alone. But of course you must be conscientious and take those assignments
seriously to earn those points.

>

>         Our text is written in a conversational style that is easy to read.
**You are responsible for that reading!** Attending class is important but it
is only part of what's involved in becoming an educated person. **Do set aside
time for that reading** \- preferably before or while we are covering that
topic in class - it is key to your success. You'll need a minimum of 2 hours
per module and additional time to do the study aids in the text and online
(practicing in as many ways as possible is recommended!). It is highly
recommended that you map out a regular [Study
Schedule](http://www.tulsa.oklahoma.net/~jnichols/StudySchedule.html) for your
classes and try to stick to it. **Plan on reading about 10 pages of Psych per
class day.** Make flashcards as you read.

>

>      I will **not** be covering everything in class - not only would that be
impossible, but we wouldn't have time for demonstrations, activities, videos,
etc that help you remember the material. Of course you are always welcome to
ask questions about text material (in or out of class or by e-mail). I also
strongly encourage you to take **condensed** notes as you read. If you take
the time to outline main ideas, briefly define terms, list the pros and cons
of the theories or techniques presented, etc. (preferably in your own words,
with examples) I know you will absorb and remember material better than if you
just read and highlight. To encourage you to do so we have a few assignments
that require notes. Again - this is not busy work but a tried and true
technique for increasing learning. If you do a good job of capturing the
essentials it will be much easier to study for exams. Reading and reviewing
regularly is much more effective than cramming. Here are some online

> **About our exams: E** xams will be all multiple choice. Although some items
will test your knowledge of facts or definitions, a larger number will assess
your understanding of the material by asking you to **apply the concepts** we
cover to examples. Being able to recognize how to apply class concepts to
real-life examples requires understanding rather than rote memorization. We
will do some "application" in our in-class activities that should give you an
idea of what to expect on exams. This online resource gives you examples of
multiple choice questions of varying levels of difficulty: [How Multiple
Choice Questions Can Be Used to Measure Different Levels of Understanding of
the Same Concept. ](http://www.apa.org/ed/whoami.html#f)Our text also includes
practice tests and critical thinking exercises that can help you prepare for
exams. There are also online practice tests at [Plotnik's
website](http://psychstudy.wadsworth.com/plotnik.html). Some of his items are
likely to appear on our tests.

>

> **Test scores** will be posted on the Psychology Bulletin Board in the
glassed-in entranceway to Baker Hall that faces the Campanile bell tower.
Tests and test answer keys, once available, will be found outside my office,
Baker 441. It is important to pick up your test and figure out what questions
you got wrong, because some of those same questions will be on our final exam.
If you think that an item was mis-scored or that another response option
should be considered correct, you are welcome to fill out a test item "Moan  &
Groan Sheet", available where you pick up your exam.

> **Makeup exams** are strongly discouraged; if a makeup is necessary **you
must contact me on or before the scheduled day of the regular exam** and the
makeup **must** be taken before the exams are returned to the class. Makeup
exams will include an extra page of essay questions.  
> Back to Index  
>  
> **Grades** will be based on the total number of points accumulated during
the semester. Tests 1, 2 and 3 will each be worth about 60 points plus a few
extra credit points. The Final will include about 60 questions on new material
as well as 45 old questions drawn from Tests 1-3. These exams make up about
75% of your grade. The other 25% comes from graded assignments and about 10
attendance points (awarded on about 10 random class days during the semester).

>

> Test 1              ~60 + a couple extra credit  
> Test 2              ~60 + a couple extra credit  
> Test 3              ~60 + a couple extra credit  
> Final               ~105 (60 new & 45 old questions) + a couple extra credit  
> Assignments     105  
> Attendance        10 (taken randomly throughout the semester)  
> Total =           ~410 + about 30 extra credit

> * **Grading** \- Your final course grade will be based on the total points
earned, but you must have a passing average on the 4 exams. Grades will be
assigned according to this scale:

> **_Grade_** |  **_Percent_** |  **_Grade  _** |  **_Percent  _** |
**_Grade_** |  **_Percent_**  
> ---|---|---|---|---|---  
> **A** |  93.0-100.0%  |  **B-** |  80.0 - 82.9%  |  **D+** |  67.0 - 69.9%  
> **A-** |  90.0 - 92.9%  |  **C+** |  77.0 - 79.9%  |  **D** |  63.0 - 66.9%  
> **B+** |  87.0 - 89.9%  |  **C** |  73.0 - 76.9%  |  **D-** |  60.0 - 62.9%  
> **B** |  83.0 - 86.9%  |  **C-** |  70.0 - 72.9%  |  **F** |  0.0 - 59.9%

> **_Study Tips_**

>

> **1.   Start studying now!  **Commit to putting in the necessary time to
remember information from the course!  There is a direct relationship between
the amount of time you spend learning material and the length of time you
remember it. The general rule of thumb is 2 hours out of class for every hour
in class (YES - carrying a full load is like a full-time job!). It will take
you at least 2 hours to read the chapter each week - block out that time in
your schedule. An ideal situation is to review your notes and do some
reading/studying shortly after each class period while its fresh in your mind.  
> **2.   Space your study sessions. ** All night cram sessions are one of the
least effective ways to learn or memorize new material. Repeated spaced
practices allow you to mentally process and incorporate the information into
memory.  It's a basic fact of the way human memory works.  Students who take
the distributed practice approach to learning retain significantly more
information than students who use cramming. Can you imagine if the Panthers
tried to win after a single cram practice just before the game?  
> **3.   Read material BEFORE we cover it in class. ** Another function of
human memory is that we tend to remember things much easier when we have some
sort of mental framework to guide us.  That's exactly what reading the
material ahead of time does; it gives you that all important mental framework
so that when the professor mentions the concept, you already have a place to
"hang" the information.  
> **4.   Find a place to study where you can concentrate. ** Problems in
absorbing new information arise when distracting thoughts, background noise,
televisions, stereos, and friends sidetrack your attention. I recommend the
library.  How does your study location rate: [Study Distraction
Analysis](http://www.ucc.vt.edu/stdysk/studydis.html)  
> 5\. **BEWARE** \- so much of psych sounds familiar that it is very tempting
to think you are grasping it all just by passively listening in lecture. This
is _not_ enough to actually learn and be able to use the material in the
course. You must be an active, involved learner and really work with the text
and lecture notes to get a good grade. **Test yourself** before I test you
-can you answer all the questions in our book or on the Plotnik website
without difficulty? If you take the online practice test and only get 60%
right, there is a pretty good chance you' ll only get ~60% (D-) on our test
too! The study aids you actually produce yourself (flashcards, outlines,
concept maps) are extremely important to your learning.

**_SUMMARY OF  ASSIGNMENTS_** _AND THEIR POINT VALUES*_  
* I reserve the right to award additional extra credit points for extra effort.   
**Extra credit:**  
**Send me an email** by   9/15 (walsh@uni.edu) (2 pt)  
**Drop by my office to introduce yourself** by  9/13 (Baker 441) (2 pt)

**Required Assignments - Note the due dates: late assignments will lose
points.**

**[Who Are You Sheet ](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/whointro.html) and [Syllabus
Quiz](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/sylquiz.html) (5 pt)- Due 8/28.**

[**Library Scavenger Hunt**  ](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/library.html) (10 pts)
- **Due 9/6.**  
Our library is not only a great academic resource but also a personal resource
and retreat that everyone should get to know soon after their arrival at UNI.
I think this assignment is a fun way to learn about some of what the library
offers. To prepare you for later assignments I have also included the
locations of several of the key sources of Psych-related info on the hunt. If
you find any of my directions confusing, please let me know so I can edit the
Hunt for the next class!

**[Research Methods Exercise](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/exp.html)** (up to 20
pt) Due **9/9.** Identify the independent and dependent variables &
experimental & control group in several examples. Distinguish experimental vs
correlational research. TIP: You will be asked to to identify IVs, DVs, and
the experimental and control groups of sample experiments on our 1st exam, so
be sure you understand these terms.

**[Brain Game Notes](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/bgnotes.html)** (up to 10 pt
plus possible extra credit) **Due 9/13.**  
Come to class with organized notes on the **parts of the nervous system and
brain** and the **behaviors/functions each part is related to**. Include the
**neurotransmitters** mentioned in the book and class and their links to
behavior as well, as well as any additional brain areas mentioned in lecture.
Make yourself a sketch or 2 to remind you where the various brain areas are
located. You will use these notes to play the Brain Game, where you will
"diagnose" what part of the brain has been damaged based on the patients'
symptoms. Correct diagnoses will be rewarded and everyone who turns in good
notes will earn 10 pts. TIP: Taking notes and working on the Brain Game cases
should also help to prepare you for the approximately 20 questions about this
module that will be on our first test. Try to predict what our 20 questions
might be.

**[Classical Conditioning Homework](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/classcond.html)**
(up to 10 pt plus 2 extra credit): **Due 9/27.**  
Identify the UCS, UCR, CS & CR in several classical conditioning examples.
TIP: You will have to identify these same  
components of classical conditioning in examples on Test 2, so be ready!

[**Reinforcement Homework** ](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/rf.html)(up to 20 pt)
**Due 9/30.**  
Identify the schedule of reinforcement in several operant examples.
Distinguish between positive and negative reinforcement and punishment. TIP:
Test 2 will include some similar examples for you to identify, so consider
this practice.

[**Psych Journal Article Assignment**
](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/journal.html)(10 pt + 4 extra credit possible)
**Due 10/28.**  
Use Unistar to locate the call number of selected Psychology journals. Find
the journal in the stacks in the basement and browse through until you find  a
research report in you find interesting. (Note: a research report article
should have a Methods section telling you how the research was conducted as
well as a Results section telling you what they found.) Read how the
investigators conducted their research and try to determine if they have used
one of the research methods discussed in class or in the text. [Tips on
Reading Research
Reports](http://adminwww.flinders.edu.au/CAS/readscience.html)

**[Defense Mechanisms Homework](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/defense.html)** (up
to 10 pt) **Due 11/4.**  
Identify the defense mechanism operating in several examples. TIP:You'll have
to do the similar identifications on Test 3.

**[What's My Psychopathology](http://www.uni.edu/walsh/abnormaltable.html) **
(up to 10 pt) **Due 11/22.**  
Take notes on the disorders in Modules 22 and 23 in preparation for an in-
class game where you must identify the disorders portrayed in case reports.

**Short Description: Sport psychology; self-efficacy theory; coaching
education**

Dr. George studies the psychology and sociology of sport. His research
interests include the effects of psychological factors on sport performance,
gender issues in sport, and the impact of coaching education on youth sports.
George is especially interested in the role self-efficacy plays in sport
performance and physical activity. Self-efficacy is a situation-specific form
of self-confidence, and has been shown to consistently mediate human
performance.  
  
George's research has primarily focused on examining factors that impacts
self-efficacy, as ways in which self-efficacy influences performance. More
recently, Dr. George has investigated gender differences in psychological
variables associated with sport performance.

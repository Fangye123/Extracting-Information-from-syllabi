###  COURSE OBJECTIVES:

The main objective of this course is to help prepare the student to take and
pass the first level of the prestigious and rigorous Chartered Financial
Analysts' Exam. Another objective of this course is to broaden the student's
knowledge of investments by covering fixed income securities, practical
portfolio management, and other topics the student might have missed in the
first Investment course.

###  METHODOLOGY

The course will consist of lectures by instructor. Depending on class size,
students may also have to prepare and deliver a class lecture assigned by the
instructor.  


###  EXAMS AND RULES

There will be two _objective_ , equally weighted exams during the course, one
being the _comprehensive_ final exam.  


###  Grading:

The Course components will have the following weights:

Mid Term Exam            50            45  
Directed Discussion                      10  
Final Exam                    50            45  
    **Total                        100%     100%**   
    


###  EXAM RULES

Exams will be given as scheduled. Unforseen circumstances may cause the
numbers of chapters covered to be different than listed on the course
syllabus. Students who are going to be indisposed, may take the exam following
the class immediately previous to the scheduled exam or prior to the class
immediately following the scheduled exam. The student needs to make
arrangements for missed exams **prior** to the scheduled exam.

Exams closely follow material presented in class. The instructor will indicate
the type of problems/questions that the student should work.  


### FINAL GRADES

Final grades will be assigned based on the student's final numerical average.
Representative numerical averages and letter grades follow:  
    
  **Average** |  **Grade**  
---|---  
92.0 - 100 |  A  
90.0 - 92.0 |  A-

community. It is an essential element of the University's credibility. It

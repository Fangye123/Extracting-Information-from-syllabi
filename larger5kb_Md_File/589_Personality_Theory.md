### _**Course Description:_**

> This course focuses on the major models of personality including
Psychoanalytic, Neoanalytic, Cognitive, and Humanistic-Existential as well as
some of the lesser known approaches to the study of personality and personal
growth. During the term we will examine these models and approaches, the major
theories representative of each, each theories methods and research, and will
explore the assumptions about human nature which underlie each perspective. We
will examine how people like Freud, Jung, Maslow, and James reached their
conclusions about personality and examine the role that various traditions
(e.g. Hindu, Buddhist, Islamic, Native-American) have had in shaping ideas
about the development of the personality. In addition, we will apply various
theorist's and traditions ideas in an analysis of the main character in Camus'
The Stranger.

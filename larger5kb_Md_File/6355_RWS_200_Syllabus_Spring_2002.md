**Goals and Objectives:**

This course asks students to examine the way "conversations" regarding ideas
important to a culture take place over time between scholars, practitioners,
critics, artists, etc. Our shared beliefs about what is true and/or right (our
ideologies) do not spring out of nowhere, whole and unquestioned. There are,
in fact, foundational texts, each written in a specific historical context,
through which we can trace the genesis and metamorphosis of our "cultural
conversations." The underlying principles in any discipline studied at the
university will have been arrived at via this discursive process. Our goal in
RWS 200, then, is to study the way one such foundational text, created in a
specific historical context, has since been reacted to and incorporated in the
texts of other thinkers and writers. As thinkers and writers themselves,
students will locate connections between the texts we read and other knowledge
and experience they have acquired, and will then insert themselves into the
conversation in their essays and class discussions. The objective here is to
build upon the skills and knowledge developed in RWS 100, including assessing
and responding to writing goals/situations/audiences, developing effective
writing processes, and identifying the rhetorical strategies of a sound
argument. We will continue to hone all of these skills as we work toward an
understanding of the ways writers use one another's work effectively to
support their own arguments.

**Requirements:**

In this section of RWS 200, you will be required to actively read
approximately 200 pages from our texts and write three (3) essays of
approximately 5-6 pages each (these must be word-processed or typed). You will
participate in group workshops of student writing and will revise your essays
based on workshop feedback. You will also complete various weekly writing
assignments, such as text notes, summaries, and evaluations of our readings.
You'll be required to learn and use MLA conventions for citing source
materials, and as your final project, you will research and report upon the
connections you can locate between our class texts and the major (or minor)
discipline you're studying here at SDSU.

**Grades:** Your course grade will be calculated based on the following
breakdown:

Attendance** is essential and reflects your commitment to improving your
writing skills. In order to succeed, you need to come to each class session
and participate. Obviously, though, emergencies do occur. Please be aware that
regardless of the nature of any emergency preventing you from attending class,
I allow no more than four excused absences. Exceeding that limit will be cause
for failure of the course. Also be aware that regardless of whether you are
present in class, all assignments are due and must be turned in by their
scheduled due-dates. There is no extra credit. (If you are ill and cannot come
to school to turn in an assignment, you may submit it to me via email or via
the class [Blackboard Course site](http://courses.sdsu.edu/index.html).)

**

Other Class Policies of Note:

**

**_Type or word process your essay assignments._**

**Don't plagiarize:** Whether or not you change the words around in a passage
of text or use substitute vocabulary, when you use anyone else's ideas, spoken
or written, you must correctly acknowledge this use according to the rules of
academic honesty (and according to State and Federal law). We will practice
the correct procedures for citing other writers' work. Because this is such an
important issue, ****_**plagiarism of any sort will result in an F grade for
this section of RWS 200.**_

**Professional conduct is expected. ** Besides coming to class on time,
professional conduct refers to paying attention and participating in class as
well as treating other students and the instructor respectfully. This means
listening while others are speaking (rather than talking to a friend,
doodling, reading the newspaper, or sleeping, for instance). Students who
disrupt the learning environment in the classroom will be asked to leave.

**Turn off electronics. ** No pagers, cell phones, Walkman-type personal
stereos, or any other electronic or noise-producing devices are allowed to be
turned on in class.

Remember to **always have your textbook and your notebook with extra paper and
pens** available to you in class for every meeting.

 Essay Grading Criteria

> **All of your essays for this course will be graded according the following
criteria:**

> A - range essays will demonstrate a great deal of thought and a real effort
to delve into the ideas addressed. Ideas will be logically organized and
clearly expressed. The thesis and paragraph topic sentence claims will be
well-supported with appropriate, clearly explained, and detailed evidence.
Source material will be woven into the paragraphs in a logical and fluid way,
using correct MLA-style attribution. Transitions between paragraphs (and
between sentences) will lend coherence to the writing, assisting the reader in
connecting the ideas to one another and back to the thesis. The essay will use
diction appropriate to the subject and the audience being addressed. No major
grammar or mechanical errors, such as sentence fragments and run-ons, subject-
verb agreement problems or verb tense shifts, will occur in the "A" essay.

> B - range essays will also demonstrate a good deal of effort, but may differ
from the A-level essay in the approach to the thesis or topic sentences, which
might be more predictable and less inventive on the writer's part. While clear
and well-supported for the most part, some unevenness may occur in the flow of
the ideas or in some use of source material, which will make the essay less
than excellent. As with the "A-level" essay, there will be no major
grammatical or mechanical errors in the "B" essay.

> C - range essays will do an adequate job of introducing their topics, but
the thesis or topic sentences might rely on clich¨¦d expressions or obvious
truisms. There will be explanations and evidence in the "C"-level paper, but
some of this might not clearly support the main point. Source material will be
attributed, but the writer may have some difficulty composing fluid, fluent
sentences which incorporate quoted or paraphrased material. Overuse of
abstract language might keep this writing from any great depth of thought. And
transitions might be lacking in places, leading to some lack of coherence.
Occasional grammar and spelling problems might exist which keep the writing
from flowing well.

> D - range essays will probably not contain a topic sentence or thesis, but
instead will merely state a topic. If there is stated thesis, the D-essay may
veer off from the stated point. Very few examples and/or explanations will be
used to develop or support any central idea, either. Quoted material will
probably be inserted, but not commented on in any helpful way. Vocabulary
might be misused in places. Grammar errors which commonly occur in "D" essays
include sentence fragments and run-ons, subject-verb and pronoun-antecedent
agreement errors, verb tense shifts, and unclear pronoun references.

> F - level writing will most likely be fairly incoherent and well off the
mark of the assignment. There will be little or no support to guide the reader
toward understanding any possible point to be made, and grammar and mechanical
errors will make the writing difficult or impossible to follow.

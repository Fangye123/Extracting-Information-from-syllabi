Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia. We will be concerned with a variety of

about the following topics : slavery and abolition in Brazil; race and class
in urban Brazil; urbanization, working-class culture, gender, and populism in
Argentina; socialism, dictatorship, and movements for democracy in Chile; and
ethnicity, race, culture ,and politics in Bolivia. We will also consider a
variety of approaches to writing history, especially the relationship between
history and anthropology and the use of oral history.

supplementary readings for one section of readings, topic to be selected after

Communications Building. Our coursework includes field trips. Because of
distance, some of these field trips must begin earlier and/or end later than
the listed class period. Please participate in these field trips so that you
will have additional information and experience to help you write most
effectively about environmental subjects.

> **INTEGRITY**

>

> Compliance with University of Tennessee academic ethics, as explained in
Hilltopics, and with the standards of professional journalistic practice is
expected. Plagiarism will result in a failing grade and possibly expulsion
from the university. Writing that you have submitted in another class or have
previously published or that has been critiqued or edited by a professor or a
professional editor may not be submitted in this course without the explicit
permission of the instructor.

>

> **GRADING**

>

> Your principal written work will be four short articles on local issues
treated by this class and then a final longer article on a subject of your
choosing. There will also be several brief in-class writing exercises.  
>  Your participation in discussions in class and on field trips will count
significantly in your grade because your contributions make the class more
interesting and valuable to your colleagues and me.  
>  No written examinations are scheduled, but please come to class ready to
discuss the assigned examples of environmental writing and essays on
environmental reporting. Please also study the background reading requested by
guest speakers and come to class prepared to interview those speakers. If some
students are not prepared, I will give unannounced exams that will count for
up to 33% of your final grade.

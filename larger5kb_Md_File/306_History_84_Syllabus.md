**Description.** During the last six hundred years China has been seen by
Westerners through many different lenses, appearing sometimes as a land of
plenty, other times as a land of opportunity, and still other times as a land
of danger, but it has always remained an exotic focus of the Western
imagination. This course will trace the ups and downs of the West's
complicated relationship with the  "Middle Kingdom" from the time of Marco
Polo to the present, looking at cultural, intellectual, political, military,
and economic encounters and examining the various images of China that have
emerged at different points in time. Throughout, we will be trying to discover
what those representations say about China and what they say about the West,
raising our level of cultural self-awareness through historical knowledge.

**Requirements.** The course meets three times a week, twice for lecture and
once for discussion section. Apart from a midterm and a final examination, you
are asked to submit two short papers (approximately 3 pages each) analyzing a
set of primary sources; further instructions on this paper will be provided by
your section leader. The first of these papers is due in section in Week 3,
the second in Week 8. In addition, by the end of the quarter you are asked to
turn in short web-based worksheets on three China-related films. These films
will be screened in class on 4 April, 2 May, and 23 May. Final grades will be
based on the examinations (55%), papers (25%), film worksheets (10%), and
participation in section (10%).

**Readings.** The following books are required reading and are for sale at the
UCen Bookstore and the Isla Vista Bookstore:

David Mungello, _The Great Encounter of China and the West, 1500-1800_ (Rowman
& Littlefield, 1999)

##  Course Description

Some stories are obviously for morons.  Maybe a martian didn't really have
Elvis's baby.  When people believe what they read or see on TV, however, the
results can be dangerous.  American militias are taking up arms against Jews
and the UN because they believe lies about a New World Order.  Some lies are
told by omission.  Did they teach you in school about black cowboys of the Old
West?  Or U.S. internment camps for innocent Japanese-Americans?  And still
other stories are just plain confusing.  Does capital punishment help?  Should
erotica be regulated?  We will read _[Lies My Teacher Told
Me](http://www.uvm.edu/%7Ejloewen/)_ to learn how history texts used by most
high schools tell only parts of stories.   The parts they tell, too, construct
much of America's mythology.  After we examine some cases of historical myth
making, we will focus on contemporary American myths.  Specifically we will
study the effect that TV and advertising have on rampant materialism and how a
more environmentally conscientious society might combat the American practice
of shopping as recreation.  We'll read.  We'll surf the Web.  We'll argue and
write.  We'll learn critical thinking skills.  If you work hard, you should be
a better thinker at the end of this class.

##  Course Requirements

You will need to buy the books.  More importantly, you'll need to read them.
More important still, you'll need to analyze and think about what you are
reading.  Coming to class will help a great deal.  Allegheny College requires
that every faculty member publish her or his policy on attendance.  My policy
is that you can do what you want.  You are coming to college voluntarily.  At
least you should be.  You should come to class for the same reason.  That is,
I expect you to come to class because you want to learn something and you
think that coming to class and participating in discussions are the best place
to do your learning.  You will need to purchase two terrific paperbacks for
this class.  _Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History
Textbook Got Wrong_ , by [James W. Loewen](http://www.uvm.edu/%7Ejloewen/)
(1995), Touchstone Book, Published by Simon and Schuster, New York, NY and

Club Books, San Francisco, CA.

##  Grades

Your grades in this class will depend on the papers you write (50%), your lab
reports and presentations (25%), and class participation (25%).  Hint:  If you
check out the attendance policy, you will notice that attendance is up to you.
If you choose not to come to class, you should probably expect really crummy
grades in the categories of class participation and presentations at the very
least.

##  Term Paper Topics

Return to Top  
The following list of topics is by no means exhaustive.  It is a brief list of
topics that I think should receive a lot more attention in history texts.
Here is your chance to teach yourself more history.

What did Black Cowboys of the Old West do for a living?  
Why were there Japanese Internment camps during W.W.II?  
Do Pesticides cause sterility in animals, including humans?  
Are lawns bad for the environment?  
How have cars changed our landscape and our culture?  
What was the role of the Swiss banks in supporting the Nazis?  
How has Disney shaped our view of nature and history?  
Why do Americans work so hard, often at the expense of family and leisure?  
How did women help settle the West?  
Was Christopher Columbus a good guy or a bad guy?  
Why and how often has the U.S. used military intervention in  Nicaragua,
Guatemala, Dominican Republic?  
Why was the US fighting in Vietnam?  



##  Useful Web Links

Return to Top  
The [Allegheny Honor
Code](http://webpub.alleg.edu/student/w/whiskek/index.html) \- The Honor
Committee has set up a terrific Web site to explain all their requirements and
expectations.  Just so you don't get thrown out of school for being ignorant
of the college guidelines, and the law of the nation, I recommend you check it
out.

[Lest We Forget](http://www.coax.net/people/lwf/) \- A wonderfully rich page
full of overlooked history of African Americans. The site is upbeat and loaded
with links to other sites.

[Wampanoag History](http://dickshovel.netgate.net/wampa.html) \- Here is the
story of the discovering the Pilgrims and how things went once they arrived.

[Index of Native American History](http://dickshovel.netgate.net/wampa.html)
on the Web - This is a well organized set of links to other sites covering
Native Americans from North America and their cultures.

[Thanksgiving Resources](http://www.bham.wednet.edu/thanks.htm) There are
several sites out there covering Thanksgiving.  Most have links and
descriptions of ways to make the perfect pumpkin pie and create the cutest
table spread.  This site, prepared for the Bellingham Public Schools, is one
of the most informative out there.  It covers the history of Thanksgiving from
a number of perspectives.

[The Skeptical Inquirer](http://advicom.net/~fitz/csicop/si/) calls itself the
magazine for science and reason.  It's a great one for debunking current
mythology.  Another page dedicated to debunking UFOs, aliens, the paranormal,
etc. is [T-Files](http://martinb.home.mindspring.com/t_files.htm).

There are several on-line publications that cover the news that doesn't get
covered by the news.  Naturally there are some on the political right and
others on the political left.  Here are a few worth keeping an eye on if you
are interested in the kinds of stories that _Lies My Teacher Told Me_ thinks
ought to get more air time.   [Fairness and Accuracy in
Reporting](http://www.fair.org/) covers media bias.  On a daily basis
[Pacifica Radio](http://www.pacifica.org/) in San Francisco, and [WBAI
radio](http://www.wbai.org/) in New York City keep you up to date on stories
nobody else covers.  The [Progressive Magazine](http://www.progressive.org/)
also stays on top of other media outlets and stories others seem unwilling to
print.



## Three Student Essays on the Real Thanksgiving

All the Freshmen in this class wrote two drafts of a letter to their parents
describing what they believed really happened at the first Thanksgiving, and
also what it meant to them to learn that history was more compex and nuanced
then they had originally thought. Three essays are presented here because of
their unique perspectives.  [Korey

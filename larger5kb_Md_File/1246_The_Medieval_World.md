**DESCRIPTION AND GOALS**  
   History 1112 introduces some basic facts and themes of medieval life, circa
1000-1300 A.D., including demographic and economic transformation; social and
familial structures; religious ideals, institutions, and practices; the nature
of power and its manifestations; and the expression of thought and feeling in
literary prose and poetry.  
   Readings include both original medieval materials in translation (primary
sources), and modern scholarly interpretations (secondary sources). Both kinds
of sources require us to be alert, active readers, and both require us to
engage our imaginations to connect with the medieval past. Learning to
evaluate primary and secondary sources is the central goal of this course, so
it will be the major focus of both class time and written work. On most days,
some or even all of our meetings will be spent in discussion: informal,
collective, and collaborative effort to make sense of what we are reading.
Written assigments will ask you to continue that enquiry individually and
formally.  
   What you get out of History 1112 will depend very largely on what you bring
to it. The course is organized around the readings. Lectures are meant to
provide context for, and guidance in, our individual and collective
evaluations, but they will not attempt a systematic examination of all
subjects raised in the readings: History 1112 is not a survey course. This
makes regular preparation for class, faithful attendance, and willingness to
participate actively essential for success.

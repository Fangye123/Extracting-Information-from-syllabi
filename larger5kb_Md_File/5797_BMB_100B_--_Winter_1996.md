General Information

_**Course Description:**_ BMB100B covers topics involving enzymes, membranes
and lipids. It is essentially two mini-courses; the first half will cover
various aspects of enzymes, including enzyme kinetics, inhibition,
allosterism, mechanisms and catalytic antibodies and RNA. The second half will
deal with membrane composition and structure, specialized membrane functions,
active transport and electrochemical storage, excitable membranes and
neurotransmitters, membrane receptors and sensory transduction mechanisms.

_**Requirements:**_

_Reading assignments:_ Please be sure to have read the assigned reading in
Stryer prior to the lecture.

_Problem sets:_ Most weeks there will be a problem set due the following week.
Solutions will be posted in the Science Library. Late submissions will not be
accepted. The homework problems will contribute 20% to the final grade.

_Exams:_ There will be a midterm covering the first half of the course, and a
final exam covering the second half. Each exam will count 40% toward the final
grade. _There will be no make-up exams except for medical reasons._

**_ABOUT THE COURSE_** __

The material in BMB 100B actually consists of two entirely separate
components, enzymes, and membranes and lipids. The handout outlines the
schedule we hope to follow. Please make sure you read the appropriate sections
in the text (Stryer, 4th edition) in advance of the lecture. **NOTE** that we
will cover some material in lectures which is not covered in the text.

I have had a number of books placed on reserve in the Science Library. These
are meant as supplemental material to give greater, and more in depth,
coverage then there will be time for in class, and to give you additional
perspective on the subject.

I will also be putting my lecture notes on electronic reserve and the Web. I
will frequently show slides or computer graphics to illustrate points,
especially enzyme/protein structures.

The _**requirements**_ for the course are as follows; weekly problem sets to
be turned in the following week, possibly a critical review of a journal
article, and the midterm and final exams. Your evaluations will be based on
your performance on these. It is important, therefore, that the papers you
turn in be your own work!

One other point I want to mention concerns questions during class. I encourage
you to ask questions. Also in order to help me get to know you please state
your name when you ask a question, it will help me get to know who you are.
Also I encourage you to use electronic mail for communications - my email
address is enzyme@cats.ucsc.edu or fink@chemistry.ucsc.edu. I have set up a
web page for the course, and will use it for a variety of purposes. Therefore
it will be really helpful for you if you have access to the web (e. g. from
any Campus computer instructional lab, or via modem from your home computer).

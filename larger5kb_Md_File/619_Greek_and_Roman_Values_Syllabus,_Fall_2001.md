#### Course Description:

Most historians agree that the foundations of many facets of modern life were
laid in ancient Greece and Rome. In the field of politics, representational
government originated in Greece and developed into republican institutions in
Rome. Intellectually the ancient mediterranean gave us almost every field we
recognize today from literature to philosophy, natural science to
communications. In religion Greece left a rich tradition of pagan cults, and
the Roman world brought us the two most influential religions of the modern
world, Christianity and Islam. This course will attempt to understand some of
the complex forces that shaped ancient culture. But rather than dwell on wars,
political maneuvers, philosophical subtleties, literary artifice, or artistic
achievement, we will ponder the values of ancient Greeks and Romans, how they
were formed, and how in turn they helped form the many institutions still
familiar to us today.

This course has been selected to represent historical analysis in our core
curriculum, and thus will pay close attention to the workings of history.
Students will confront a variety of problems in historical interpretation, and
will be required to find their own individual approaches and solutions. We
will discuss continuity and causes of change from the early Greek period to
Classical Athens to the period of Hellennistic kings and on to the Roman
republic and empire. We will discuss if, and in what ways, the ancient world
progressed; the growth of literacy and its impact; and the development of
historical self-consciousness in the context of the numerous and varied
documents that Greece and Rome have left us. We will work through more than a
millennium chronologicaly as we discuss a variety of ancient values relating
to the central topics of war, rhetoric, the gods, and law as well as mass
culture, sexuality, and whatever else interests the class. We will see some
stunning changes throughout our periods, as well as some unexpected
continuity, probably with many of us disagreeing with each other as we go.
Such disagreement will lead to a more stimulating experience of history, and
perhaps to a richer perspective on our own values.

#### Course Requirements

This course is intended to stimulate thought, and thus the first and most
difficult requirement is to think. This thinking will best be directed towards
the readings so students will be expected to read carefully all of the
selections and be prepared to discuss them in class. In order to give
structure to the reading and discussion eash student will propose a
provisional system of values on Sept. 18 (2-3 pages). By the end of the
semester each student will have revised and refined this system into essay
form and turn this in as her paper (10 pages, double-spaced, 12 point font, 1
inch margins) for the course. There will also be two tests given to help
studtents to synthesize the material of the course.

#### Grading

  * Class Participation 20 % 
  * Values Exercise 10% [DUE September 18) 
  * Paper 25 % [DUE December 7, 5 PM] 
  * Midterm 20 % [Oct. 18] 
  * Final 25 % [Dec. 11] 
  * Assessment Criteria

Papers, and midterm/final essays will be assessed according to the following
criteria. These are listed in hierarchical order though all criteria are
almost equal in importance. It is of particular importance to remember that
this course focuses on historical analysis. We are not trying just to amass
evidence or just to rehearse standard historical judgments. Rather we are
concentrating closely on the values and attitudes of Greek and Roman people,
how they were formed, and how they changed over time. So above all students
should concentrate on analyzing the evidence gleaned from our course
materials.

1) evidence of serious thought on their chosen argument/problem  
2) clarity of proposed argument/analysis/system  
2) command of the appropriate reading (or whatever evidence is applied)  
3) ability to draw in other sources to the discussion  
4) command of general history surrounding the specific problem  
5) familiarity with the class discussion  
6) persuasiveness of argument  
7) synthesis of specific problem into the broader issues of Greek and Roman
values  
8) originality or at least attempted originality

Staff Development

**Content**  
This workshop will focus on when and how to utilize WWW resources and
interactive technology as an integral part of staff development.

The workshop activities will explore trends, issues, research and practical
strategies in designing staff development for busy classroom teachers. Take a
few moments to review the [workshop objectives](index.html#obj).

This course consists of five modules. In a few of the activities you will work
as part of a team, so it is important that you are willing to collaborate with
other class members to expand your expertise and support others. In these
cases, it is important that each person is committed to meeting the deadlines
for that particular activity. Your colleagues will be depending on your
feedback.

**Course Goal** :  
By the end of the course each participant will create a Web-based module which
will be integrated with your staff development program and utilize Web-based
training resources.

**Modules** :

**

  1. Professional Development in the Digital Age
  2. Searching for Training Resources 
  3. Web-based Conferencing Tools and Techniques
  4. Instructional Design of Web-based Training
  5. Web Page Design for Training Modules** 

Each module is structured around an Introduction, Readings, Activities, and
Activity Checklist.

**Participation**

Participants will:

  * Exchange e-mail with other participants and participate in a workshop listserv and electronic conferencing; 
  * Review and discuss online background reading materials; 
  * Access professional listservs to request additional information; 
  * Engage in real-time _text-chat_ with other participants; 
  * Develop a training resource Web page. 

You will be able to customize activities to your specific training
responsiblities and needs.

**Collaboration**  
During each activity, you are encouraged to share your discoveries and
successes with other workshop participants and collaborate during team
problem-solving. Participants may share drafts of works-in-progress for peer
feedback and discuss ideas and suggestions before submitting the final copy of
each project.

This may be your favorite part of the workshop. You will find creative ways to
develop lively and fun group process skills as well as outstanding projects.

**Workshop Mailing List (LISTSERV)**  
Many of the course instructional materials will arrive via e-mail, so it is
important that you check your e-mail regularly. Similarly, you will submit
your completed assignments to the facilitator via e-mail.

Perhaps its most vital use, however, is the exchange of ideas that can occur
among workshop participants. You will be asked to complete a minimum of two
postings per week during the workshop; this will include reacting to readings,
discussing the topic/issue of the week, sharing information and resources with
classmates, or responding to a problem posted by peers or your facilitator.

You will receive a list of participants' e-mail addresses at the beginning of
the workshop and are encouraged to communicate with each other frequently and
freely.

You will also participate in real-time one-to-one chats with your facilitator,
discussion chats and team chats with learning partners when developing your
project.

**Reflection**  
At the conclusion of selected modules you will write a concise (250-300 word)
reflection that responds to questions such as:

  * What was the most valuable information that you learned in this module? 
  * How will you implement this in your school? district? 
  * In what area(s) do you feel you need more information or practice?

**Evaluation**  
Your grade will be based on:

> 50% - Satisfactory completion of module activities

>

> 20% - Final Project

>

> 15% - Online Discussion (postings to listserv, discussion board and
participation in real-time chats)

>

> 15% - Self-reflection

Your projects will be evaluated using standards listed on the module rubrics
or checklists.

> A -- Exceeds the standard

>

> B -- Proficient demonstration of the standard

>

> I -- Incomplete demonstration of the standard (Work must be resubmitted.)

Evaluation of your listserv participation is cumulative and subjective based
on notes that the facilitator records each week. E-mail your facilitator for
help in upgrading your participation in the listserv discussion.

> _Excellent_ indicates you participated above the minimum level in both
quantity and clarity of communication in your listserv postings.

>

> _Average_ indicates you met the minimum requirement.

>

> _Below average_ indicates you consistently contributed below the minimum two
messages per week or contributions were merely perfunctory ("I agree with so
and so.") or unclear.

Reflections will be evaluated for clarity and your understanding of the
readings and activities.

Any time that you want to ask about your progress, send a message directly to
your facilitator.

**Resources Needed**  
Reading materials will be included as e-mail mini lectures or references on
the WWW.

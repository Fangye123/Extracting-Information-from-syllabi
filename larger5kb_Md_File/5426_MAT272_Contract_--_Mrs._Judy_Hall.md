**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** This discrete mathematics course is an introduction to
abstract mathematical structures, with special emphasis on theories and
methods relevant to computer science.   General areas of emphasis include:
mathematical reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures,
applications, and algorithmic thinking, introduction to formal systems and
techniques of proofs, combinatorial versus relational structures, directed and
undirected graphs; Boolean algebra; abstract languages and machines.  Specific
topics will come from the following list: integer arithmetic in different
bases, logic (propositions and truth tables), set theory, functions,
algorithms, matrices, mathematical reasoning, mathematical induction,
recursion, counting techniques (permutations and combinations), recurrence
relations, relations, graph theory, trees, boolean algebra, languages and
grammar, and state transition diagrams.  Students are required to use
calculators in the course.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**[Behavioral (learning)
objectives](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/obj272.htm) are the
items/concepts that you are expected to know to satisfactorily complete this
course. They are the items on which you will be tested. It is anticipated that
**students will require a minimum of   6 hours per week outside of class
(homework and study time)** to meet the behavioral objectives for this course.

**REQUIRED COURSE TEXTBOOK:** The required textbook for this course is **_A
First Course in Discrete Mathematics_** , by John C. Molluzzo and Fred
Buckley, Waveland Press Inc, 1997.

**COURSE SUPPLIES:** Please bring the textbook, writing implements, paper,
your calculator, your brain, and your sense of humor to every class.

**COOPERATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT** :

* Many students find it is easier to learn the material to be covered on an exam by working in a small group. You may assign yourselves to a **no-larger-than-4-person group** and choose a group leader. It is possible that group membership may change during the semester, and hence group leaders should notify me via e-mail as to actual group membership on the Monday before a scheduled exam.
* On the other hand, some students hate to work in groups, so you will also have the opportunity to decide if you wish to work alone (as an " **Independent Contractor** "). Independent contractors should notify me of their decision to work alone via e-mail sometime prior to the first exam. It would be helpful if independent contractors would notify me of their choice to continue as an independent contractor via e-mail on the Monday before each scheduled exam.
* **Exam "GROUP BONUS"** : If a group's exam average exceeds the exam score of the highest independent contractor, the group that has the highest exam average on the first, second, and third exams will receive a bonus of 5 points, which will be added to each group member's overall point total. Group members who miss an exam will hurt their group's average by submitting a score of 0.  There will be no group bonus points given on the fourth exam.
* **Group leaders** will be responsible for their group's performance on the semester programming project/presentation, and hence will grade the group members' participation in the group programming project and presentation on a scale of 1-100 %. Group leaders (but NOT independent contractors) will earn an extra 20 points if their group programming project and presentation   (see below) is completed in an acceptable fashion.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS** :  For each hour spent in class, the student is
expected to spend two hours out of class doing homework, that is, 6 hours of
homework and studying per week. [Homework problems are assigned for each class
lecture](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/homework272.htm) topic as
specified on the tentative schedule sheet. Homework will NOT be graded, except
in the rather unlikely case that I choose to collect it and count it as extra
credit. Homework answers, many of which are available on the internet, will be
reviewed if requested.  Students may work together on homework assignments,
helping each other master the required competencies, since MASTERY of the
material by each student is what is important. Students should make every
attempt to complete homework assignments in a timely fashion; students are
cautioned not to procrastinate.

**EXAMS** :  There will be four 100-point in-class, closed-book exams, given
on the dates indicated on the [tentative
schedule](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/sched272.htm).  The lowest
exam score will be dropped. The student missing an exam will drop that exam.
In the event that a student misses two exams, that student may take a
100-point in-class, closed-book COMPREHENSIVE MAKE-UP EXAM which will be
administered during my office hours (7:30-9:00am) on the Monday of the last
week of the semester. Students must sign up for this exam at least one week in
advanve. **EXAM "GROUP" BONUS:** The group with the highest exam average (see
"Cooperative Learning Environment") which exceeds the highest independent
contractor score on exams 1, 2 and 3 will receive a bonus of +5 points, and
these bonus points will be added to each group member's or the independent
contractor's overall grade total.

**SEMESTER (PROGRAMMING PROJECT or CASE STUDY ANALYSIS) and CLASS
PRESENTATION:**  
The textbook contains numerous case studies and short programming exercises
relating discrete math to specific computer science topics, each of which
generally includes some history or background information, some theory, some
examples, and some exercises. I have combined the programming exercises (that
build on work done in lecture) into small semester programming projects, and
each group and each independent contractor will choose either one of the
programming projects or one of the case studies listed below, on a first
choice basic. Programming projects may be done in your programming language of
choice. A list of the [possible Semester Programming Projects or Case Study
problems](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/272Projects.html) will be
provided.

Each group and each independent contractor doing a Case Study analysis will be
responsible for:

* (1) preparing and giving a 10-15 minute class presentation on that material during the last two weeks of the semester (schedule to be developed at a later date), and
* (2) preparing and distributing handouts of the solutions to the exercises associated with that Case Study.

  
Each group and independent contractor doing a Programming Project will be
responsible for:

* (1) preparing and giving a 10-15 minute class presentation of your program during the last two weeks of the semester (schedule to be developed at a later date), and
* (2) preparing program listings (with extensive internal program documentation), example output, and EXTENSIVE external program documentation

  
The Semester Programming Projects and Case Study Analysis Projects will be
graded on a scale of 100 points in the following fashion:

* 15% from the average grade assigned by classmates and visitors in attendance for the presentation (presentation grading sheets will be provided)
* 40% from my subjective opinion of your Case Stufy or Programming Project presentation
* 45% from my subjective opinion of the required documentation you provide (Solution to all exercises for a Case Study analysis OR Internal/External Program Documentation for a Programming Project)
* Note that Group leaders can earn a maxiumum of 120 points
* Independent Contractors and Group Members can earn a maximum of 100 points (group members will have a % grade assigned by their group leader)

**GRADE ENHANCEMENT OPTIONS** **#1 OPTIONAL COMPUTER WORK : ** The student
will provide five (5) internet sites that deal with his/her actually learning
and understanding [a specific learning
objective](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/obj272.htm) covered in class
(see the [MAT272 Behavioral
Objectives](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/obj272.htm)). Submission of
the correctly completed packet (Internet site cover page and site description
forms) for a specific discrete math learning objective can **add 10 points to
a test grade**. See the web page
(<http://www.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/ExampleSearch.htm>) for some helpful
hints on how to complete an internet search on mathematics learning
objectives.

Each internet site will be discussed on a form to be provided on the internet
by the instructor and which the student should print from the internet (make
sure -- under File|Page Setup -- that the left/right, top/bottom margins are
set at 0.5" in your browser). The five internet sites completed for a specific
learning objective should be collated and attached together into a packet with
a cover page (also to be provided by the instructor on the internet). The
submitted packet should include:

* a completely filled-in cover page (a blank one is provided on the internet by the instructor at the URL  (<http://www.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/MAT272InternetSitesPacketCoverPage.htm>) which identifies the learning objective
* for each of the 5 internet sites that helped you learn the objective:
     (1)  a printout of the web page (showing the URL) and
     (2) the completed site evaluation form (a blank one is provided on the internet by the instructor at the URL  (<http://www.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/MAT272InternetSitesEvaluationForm.htm>) which comments on the usefulness of the site to an introductory algebra student. The comments should include information about the site, page title, page URL, page summary, date page was last updated, language of the page and considerable commentary on the page content.
**BUT** ...there are a few catches (aren't there always?), and these are as
follows:

* Only the FIRST person submitting URLs [for a specific learning objective](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/obj272.htm) can earn extra credit for that learning objective, so that there will be no duplication of learning objective extra credit. I will keep a record of the learning objectives for which internet search extra credit has been submitted (henceforth called "used"), and notify the class via the **_[discrete-list](mailto:discrete-list@ryker.aet.cup.edu)_** mailing list.
* You may submit AT MOST an extra credit packet for 8 learning objectives, one from each chapter mentioned below.
* The due date for optional internet search work will depend on the objective chosen. The earlier you submit your work, the better your chances are of submitting an internet search for an "un-used" learning objective. The DUE DATES are:
**An objective from the chapter on** |  **is DUE  **  
---|---  
"Number Systems"  or "Set Theory and Logic" |  due in class on the day of the
first hour-exam  
"Combinatorics" or "Probability" |  due in class on the day of the second
hour-exam  
"Relations and Functions" or "Vectors and Matrices"  |  due in class on the
day of the third hour-exam  
"Boolean Algebra"or "Graph Theory"  |  due in class on the day of the fourth
hour-exam  
  
**#2 OPTIONAL INTERNET WEB PAGE CREATION EXERCISE** : A **group** or an
independent contractor or an individual may design, develop, and implement a
web page entitled:   " ** _Learning Discrete Math -- A Reference Guide for
College Students"_** making use of neat graphics and the Discrete Math URLs
identified by classmates in #1 above (provided by me or by your classmates).
This web page must reside on either of the live web servers _duncan.cup.edu_
or _ryker.aet.cup.edu_   or _sighsy.cup.edu  _ and should contain at least 30
links (at least 5 in each of the 6 categories). **Submission of the final URL
and a printout of the completed web page can add 30 points to a test grade (IF
the web page is well organized, IF it contains neat and relevant graphics, IF
I like it, and IF the web page contains no malfunctioning links when I test
it).** The due date for this optional internet web page development work will
be the Monday of the last week of the semester.

**#3 OPTIONAL HTLM PROJECTS** : It would be wonderful to have ALL of the
answers to all the problems in the textbook available on the web.  But it is
very tedious work to convert the answer book text into HTML format.  20 BONUS
points are available for correctly completing the mark-up of an entire chapter
of answers (from the answer book which I will provide) in HTML format. This is
The homework answerThe instructor may assign optional programming projects
relevant to the current lecture topic. Programming project specification and
recommended programming language, point value, and due date would be either
announced in class or posted to the discrete-math class mailing list.

**COURSE GRADING SCHEME** **RESULTS:** All grading done in this course will be
based on RESULTS, and NOT on effort. Though an extensive amount of effort is
required on the part of the student, if the effort put forth does not produce
results, then for the purpose of this course, the effort has been spent in
vain.

**FINAL GRADES:** Final grades will be determined from the following scale.

**Point Values for Required Activities**  
           4 Exams @ 100 points (drop lowest)  = 300 points   
                                      Case Study  = 100 points   
                ANY EXTRA CREDIT or BONUS POINTS

**                                 MAXIMUM Total = 400 points**

|  **Final Grade Determination**  
**360** -    400 points --- A  
**320** - < 360 points --- B  
**280** - < 320 points --- C  
**240** - < 280 points --- D  
000 -< 300 points --- F  
---|---  
  
**GRADES to DATE:** On class days when graded items are returned for
discussion, students will be informed of their individual grade-to-date. This
will provide the student with the information necessary to make course
withdrawal decisions in a timely fashion (see W/WP/WF). Students absent from
class should make timely arrangements to see the instructor to review their
points earned and grade-to-date.

**BORDERLINE FINAL GRADES:** Borderline grade cases will be determined
entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Students who whine at the
instructor when discussing grades guarantee limited consideration of a
borderline case.

**INCOMPLETE:** An "I" grade (incomplete) will be given ONLY in the case of
extenuating circumstances (serious illness of student or death in immediate
family) and only if the course work completed to date is satisfactory (70% or
better). Students who whine at the instructor and expect/ demand an I grade
guarantee limited consideration of their case.

**W/WP/WF:** Withdrawal from a course and grade-to-date go hand in hand.
Students can withdraw with a W grade during the first 6 weeks of the semester,
regardless of percentage grade or corresponding letter grade. However, during
weeks 6-12, withdrawing students receive either a WP if the percentage grade
to date is 70% or better (letter grade of A,B,C) or a WF if the percentage
grade to date is below 70% (letter grade of D,F). Because students cannot for
any reason withdraw after the end of Week 12, attention should be paid to the
methods described earlier for improvement of grades; students should not just
disappear from the instructor's sight.

**CHEATING or ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:** Any student discovered committing an act
of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of F for the course. Academic
dishonesty shall include, but not be limited to: **Cheating on Exams  **  
\--Copying exam answers from another student.  
\--Bringing written notes to class.  
\--Asking someone for the answers to test questions.  
\--Stealing or having in one's possession without permission, any tests,
notes, materials or property belonging to or generating from faculty, staff or
students. | **Aiding another student committing an act of academic
dishonesty**  
\--Willfully offering to a student, answers or information related to tests or
examinations  
\--Doing another student's assignments.  
\--Taking a test  for another person.

* * *

**GENERAL COURSE NOTES** **SCHEDULE:** The student is responsible for keeping
aware of any changes made by the instructor to the [distributed tentative
schedule](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/sched272.htm).

**ATTENDANCE:**

* (1) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes; a record of attendance will be kept by the instructor. The student will be expected to sign a sheet during each class period indicating his/her presence.
* (2) No distinction between excused and un-excused absences (except in prolonged doctor-verified health situations when an Incomplete grade might be justified); the amount of work to be made up as a result of an excused absence versus an un-excused absence is identical.
* (3) No points will be deducted from the final totals for non-attendance; the student is considered to be an adult capable of making his/her own decisions about class attendance.
* (4) Students missing a class where handouts were provided are responsible for obtaining copies of these handouts from the instructor.
  


    
    


**RETURN POLICY for SUBMITTED PAPERS:** Any papers submitted for grading (be
they homework assignments, exams printouts, or quizzes) will NOT NECESSARILY
be returned to the student to keep in his possession. They will be returned to
the student and discussed in class, but must then (at the instructor's
discretion) be returned to the INSTRUCTOR'S POSSESSION. Students who are
absent from class on the day graded papers are returned for student perusal
should see the instructor during office hours (or by appointment) to review
graded papers.

**STUDENT RIGHTS and RESPONSIBILITIES:**  
The handout entitled **"[Student Rights and
Responsibilities](http://ryker.aet.cup.edu/~jhall/s2001/rights.htm)"** has
been compiled from discussions with many faculty members at many institutions.
The document represents the thoughts and opinions of me personally; it is NOT
to be considered a document which represents a published policy statement
issued by the administration of California University. **Student rights** , in
my opinion, comprise those things which are due to any student by moral
principles; correspondingly, student responsibilities, in my opinion,
represent the particular moral burdens or obligations owed on the part of the
student. It is important to me that students in my classes clearly understand
my feelings on this matter, and thus the document specifically identifies what
I believe are the rights and corresponding responsibilities of all students.

**ACCOMMODATIONS for STUDENTS with DISABILITIES**

* **LEARNING DISABILITIES:** Students with learning disabilities work through the CARE Project Office (office location: EDU 110, phone: 938-5781). The accommodation request form should be completed and submitted to the professor to acknowledge the accommodation arrangements. Faculty may contact the CARE Project Office to confirm that the accommodation has been approved based on the student's documentation and that the arrangements are appropriate.
* **ALL OTHER DISABILITIES:** Students requiring special considerations must get in touch with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (office location: Room 114 Clyde Hall, phone: 938-4012). The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities will notify the instructor in writing of the accommodations you need in compliance with 504/ADA.

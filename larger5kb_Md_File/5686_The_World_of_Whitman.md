**Description:**

In this course we will consider selected Whitman texts in relation to broader
cultural issues.  Whitman's life was shaped by his long engagement with books,
magazines, and newspapers--that is, with key features of print culture.  Our
own cultural moment is shaped by the explosion of new technology that is
changing the face of education, editing, libraries, and classrooms.  Thinking
about Whitman in terms of both print and bytes can offer new perspectives on
the tools of knowledge that characterized his world and shape our own.

Whitman, of course, has also become a popular icon.  He figures in collective
memory in remarkable and varied and competing ways.  Whitman's afterlife can
be traced not only in poetry and fiction, but in architecture, popular music,
the visual arts, advertising, and film.  We will consider Whitman's continuing
life by noting in passing Walt Whitman schools, bridges, murals, and museums,
but mainly (this term at least) by considering how he has been made and remade
in the twentieth century in two genres, poetry and film.

This class will also touch periodically on the work of Emily Dickinson.  We
will turn to Dickinson's work when opportunities arise for useful crossings
and comparisons with Whitman.   Although specific reading assignments are
listed below, I want this course to retain fluidity so as to be responsive to
your evolving interests, to my own enthusiasms, and to new scholarship that
emerges even during the course itself.  I would like the class to be a vital
process (as seems fitting because process itself is a central concern in the
study of these poets).  We will study how, for these poets, to create was to
write, revise, refine, and sometimes transform.

The poetry of Whitman and Dickinson, as suggested, is more evolutionary than
static.  Since they typically produced their works through a process of
multiple iterations, the very nature of their poetry becomes easier to study
because of the capabilities of  hypertext.  Once freed from the relatively
fixed form of print, studies of Whitman and Dickinson become open to some
exciting new possibilities.  As advertized, this class will make signficant
use of technology, though you need not bring technological skill or background
to the course.

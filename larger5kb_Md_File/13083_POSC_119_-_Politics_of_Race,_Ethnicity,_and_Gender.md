_COURSE DESCRIPTION_ :

This course consists of an examination of the role of African Americans, Asian
Pacific Americans, Latinos, American Indians, white ethnics, and women in all
areas of the American political system as: voter, party activist, candidate,
and public official.  The process of political socialization will be
considered, as will be the political attitudes and public policy opinions of
these groups.  The course will also consider the nature and impact of
political organizations representing these groups and the socio-historical
context within which each group acts.



_FORMAT OF CLASS_ :

Classes will include lectures by the instructor; however, emphasis is also
placed on student participation in class discussions.  Absence and academic
dishonesty policies will conform to University and College of Arts and
Sciences policies as described in the current M.U. Undergraduate Bulletin.
All students will be bound by Arts and Sciences rules and regular class
attendance is expected.



_COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING PROCEDURES_ :

_EXAMS_ :  The assigned work is as follows.  There are the specific reading
assignments drawn from the required texts.  Each student is expected to read
and digest this assigned material prior to the time when it is dealt with in
class.  Two essay exams will be based on these readings and lecture materials.
One is scheduled for mid-term, the other (comprehensive) for the final exam
period.



_TERM PAPER_ :  Each student must prepare a paper on a topic of his/her
choosing.  Please clear your topic with the instructor as early in the
semester as possible; students are also strongly encouraged to meet with the
instsructor concerning research approaches and sources.  The paper must
address the concerns of one or more of our focal groups and be closely linked
with politics and government.  (Remember this is a political science course,
not one in history, sociology, or economics).  The following are the ground
rules for the written paper.



1.   All papers are due on November 16, 2001.  A late penalty of 10% of the grade will be assessed after 2 p.m. November 19 unless unusual research or personal problems justify an extension.



2.   Papers must rely upon some scholarly sources (journals, books) rather than solely popular periodicals.  Use the _Social Science Index,_ _Public Affairs Information Service Bulletin,_ or a database that includes academic journals.   Do not rely on required texts, other textbooks, or WebPages  for your research.



3.   Appropriate scholarly form, including footnotes or endnotes, should be used in writing the paper.

  

4.   The paper should be typed, double spaced.  Minimum length required: 15 pages, excluding endnotes, bibliography, title page, tables, etc.

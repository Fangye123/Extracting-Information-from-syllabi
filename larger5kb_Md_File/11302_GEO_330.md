**Course Syllabus:** **A complete syllabus with grading criteria will be
handed out in class**

**_GEO 330:   WORLD GEOGRAPHY_**

**_Required Text:  _** H. J. de Blij and Peter O. Muller, **_Geography:
Realms, Regions, and_** **_Concepts,_** (John Wiley & Sons, Inc.).

**_Learning Objectives:_**   Students will examine the economic, physical,
political, or cultural geography of different regions of the world.
Consideration will be given to regions or realms by addressing specific
concepts of development. This course will add to a student's general education
by developing their geographic skills and by enhancing their geographic
awareness and knowledge of the world.  
**_Course Outline:_**   To best manage the material and provide the student
with the maximum opportunity for comprehension, the semester will be divided
into four sections. Each section will cover a particular world region and
conclude with an exam. Each of the four sections will have a study guide which
will outline the geographic region and the reading assignments.  
**_Course Grading:_**   All four exams together will be worth 75% of the total
grade. All worksheets, quizzes, attendance, or handouts, designed to assist
the student in mastering the information for that section, will be worth the
remaining 25% of the grade.  
**_Attendance:_**   As a student you are responsible for your attendance. If
you know you will be absent please notify the instructor or the geography
department **before class** and make arrangements to make up the work.
Attendance is required.  
**_Missing Class:_**   If you are absent and miss a quiz **IT CAN NOT BE MADE
UP** unless the instructor has been notified in advance or if it is a
legitimate emergency. In order to receive credit for an exam the student must
notify the instructor of the absence **BEFORE** class. No late exams will be
given unless arrangements have been made before the exam date. Please notify
the instructor in advance if you are not able to make it to class.  
**_Late Work:_**   Due to the large size of the class and the nature of the
material covered it is important to stay current with your reading and your
assignments. **No credit will be given** to late work handed in after that
assignment has been graded and handed back. Points will be deducted from other
late work at the instructor's discretion. All assignments will be due at the
beginning of class. Please notify the instructor in advance if you are not
able to make it to class.

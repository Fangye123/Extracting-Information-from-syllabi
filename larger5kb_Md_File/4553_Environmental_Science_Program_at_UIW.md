**Astronomy - GEOL 3415  
Course Syllabus**

**Catalogue Description** : Survey of astronomy including the history of
astronomy, telescopes, celestial mechanics, time and the seasons, the Sun and
the planets, stars and stellar evolution, nebula, galaxies, and cosmology.

**Prerequisites** : None

**Specifications** : Astronomy can be taken by anyone who wishes to fulfill
the lab science requirement as part of the overall core course requirements.
This course is a required course for those who minor in Earth Science but
optional for those who minor in Geology. The course is optional for science
majors who desire to learn about important concepts and discoveries in
astronomy, especially on topics such as the solar system, the nature and
evolution of stars, and cosmology. The course cannot be repeated for credit.
Course audience is for freshman through senior level.

**Course Description** : Astronomy is a study of the origin, nature, history,
and continuing evolution of the universe. This includes a study of the history
of astronomy and the importance of major astronomical discoveries that lead to
our current view of the universe. The course will include investigations of
the inner and outer planets, asteroids, comets, and meteorites followed by a
review of current theories on the origin of the solar system. This will be
followed by inquiry into the nature of the electromagnetic spectrum, kinds of
telescopes used for astronomical observations, the nature of the Sun, and the
nature and evolution of stars. Topics that include the broad picture of the
universe consist of the origin and evolution of galaxies, the nature of the
large-scale structure of the universe and its ultimate fate. Students will
participate in assigned class activities on each of the themes discussed
above, and take lab quizzes on selected lab assignments. Examinations will be
given on each of the astronomy topics to evaluate each student's knowledge and
comprehension.

**Course Outcomes** : Expected outcomes include knowledge on the history of
astronomy, understanding the Earth's place in the solar system, history,
origin, and nature of the planets, stars, galaxies, and the origin and
development of the universe. Specific outcomes include the following:

  1. interpret star charts for use in identification of constellations, stars, planets, and other astronomical objects in the night time sky 
  2. know and identify the component parts of reflecting, refracting, and compound telescopes; calculate magnification of telescopes 
  3. know how to use a telescope, and identify lunar features and major planetary features, double stars, open and globular star cluster, nebula, galaxies, comets 
  4. recognizing the major differences between the terrestrial and Jovian planets 
  5. interpret the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram and describe its significance in astronomy 
  6. determine distribution of globular clusters in the Milky Way galaxy and size of Milky Way galaxy through graphical analysis 
  7. describe processes of stellar evolution and current concepts of galaxy formation and evolution 
  8. interpret evidence for expansion of the universe

**Course overview**

Astronomy is a study of the origin, history, and continuing evolution of the
universe. This study includes an examination and analysis of the sun, planets,
and other objects in our solar system. Further inquiry consists of
investigations of stellar evolution, origin and evolution of galaxies, the
nature of the large-scale structure of the universe, and its ultimate fate.
Expected outcomes include knowledge on the history of astronomy, understanding
the Earth's place in the solar system, history, origin, and nature of the
planets, stars, galaxies, and the origin and development of the universe.
Lecture tests will cover notes given in class and pertinent information from
the textbook. Attendance and outside class assignments (if any) will be
considered in the final grade, especially borderline cases. There will be four
tests including a final exam, and each of these will count 20% of your total
course grade. **All tests are mandatory**. For those who miss the regularly
assigned tests, the make-up test will consist of essay questions. The grade
for the make-up exam will be given to the student, and the student can examine
the test for mistakes and errors,  but the make-up exam will not be returned
to the student. In-class Astronomy activities will include selected topics
covered in lecture, and the student will earn 20% of their course grade
through lab quizzes. Lab quizzes will be given on the same day as the lecture
test, and each lab quiz counts 5% of your total course grade. Grades will be
awarded according to the regulations specified in the current undergraduate
catalog of the University of the Incarnate Word. Please keep all of your tests
and assignments in the event there is a question concerning your grade in the
course. The instructor reserves the right to make changes in the course
schedule, and changes in lecture, and laboratory activities as needed
throughout the semester.

Astronomy Activities: In-class assignments will be given out each week. The
lecture text, class notes, and handouts will be used as resources all
astronomy assignments. Students will attend a planetarium show each month
(February, March, April) at the Scobee Planetarium, San Antonio College to
partially fulfill laboratory requirements. Please refer to syllabus for
further information on course content.

Student conduct and academic honesty : Please refer to pages 65 and 66 in the
1999-2001 UIW Undergraduate Bulletin for statements regarding student conduct
at UIW. In the 1999-2000 UIW Student Handbook, refer to page 48 regarding
class attendance, pages 48 to 51 regarding code of academic integrity, and
pages 1 to 42 regarding Statement of Community Rights and Responsibilities.

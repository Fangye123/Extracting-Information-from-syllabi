Immigration has undoubtedly become a key phenomenon in the world, leading to
major changes in most countries. France is no exception, and this course
intends to analyze the impact of immigration on French politics and society.
As a matter of fact, immigration has resulted in putting French identity into
question, compelling the French political class to accept new constraints and
French society to realize that it has become multicultural.

However, this process of social change has not taken place without trouble and
political tremors, as demonstrated by the emergence and the strong
establishment of the National Front.

On the other hand, as a result of European integration, France is facing the
growing intervention of the European Union into what have previously been
internal affairs.

How is France coping with all these changes? What is the EU influence on the
immigration policy of the French government? Will France, in turn, be able to
affect the eventual establishment of a European Union immigration policy?

This course intends to answer these questions based on the French experience
and to compare the French experience with that of other European states.

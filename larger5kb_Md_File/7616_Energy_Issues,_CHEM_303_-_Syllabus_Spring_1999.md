**Course Description and Objectives**

This course provides a comprehensive understanding of different topics in
energy issues. Understanding of these issues and their impact on global
environmental problems is critical. An introduction to basic energy concepts,
conventional and alternative energy technologies, energy resources, energy
planning, and related environmental and chemical topics is given.

The scope of this course is not limited to energy and its applications in
heating, cooling, and lighting. Related areas, such as chemical manufacturing,
environmental cleansing, food production and industry, consumption, and world
population, are explored. Other topics include coals and minerals, water
treatment, waste disposal and recycling, nuclear energy, comparisons with
other energy technologies, water and air pollution, photochemical smog, and
the greenhouse effect. Students will see energy issues and technologies in
their proper national, global, and environmental context. Knowledge and
understanding of the current science and technology is necessary for effective
energy production, consumption, and planning.

Discussion of each energy technology ( _e.g._ , fossil fuel, heat and
electricity, conventional and alternative sources, solar energy, and
chemical/petrochemical production) will include its theory, resources, and
impact will be covered. The future of energy and related technology cuts
across borders and cultures.

This course directly ties in with the university's mission statement because
it teaches critical-thinking skills that can be used in **any professional or
academic endeavor.** **The inter-disciplinary nature of this course focuses
student attention on the interrelationship between humans, their natural
surroundings, and their social environment.** Energy development and planning
necessitate cooperation, values, principles, and respect. Students will
realize that every action, literally, has a "reaction" -- chemically,
physically, and socially.

It is important that students keep up with the reading assignments, and the
information given in lecture. The class begins with the understanding of basic
yet fundamental ideas. From there we will expand your knowledge and
understanding to related issues. However, if you do not understand the
beginning material you will have difficulty comprehending the following
concepts.  
  

**Requirements:**

There will be two, one-hour tests, two quizzes, plus the final exam. Each
student will give a 15-minute oral presentation on an energy-related topic. A
four to five page paper may be turned in lieu of the speech; however, students
are strongly encouraged to give an oral presentation. Students are also
expected to come to class daily and on time.

The grading policy will be as follows:

10% | homework, presentation, and paper  
---|---  
60% | tests and quizzes  
30% | final exam  
  
  

**References:**

Students are encouraged to use literature from national and international
conferences, official government reports, Internet Resources, current
scientific publications and periodicals, and recommended texts.

More reference material will be discussed in class.

There are 339 articles and books in Wilson Library, so there is no shortage of
material readily available. These sources can be accessed through the VAX
computer system. At the $, type telnet tempest <enter>. Next, at login, type

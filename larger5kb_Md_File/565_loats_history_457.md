**_Course Description  
_** This course is designed to provide in-depth study of the Early Modern
period, from the fifteenth century through the eighteenth century, a very
exciting period of European history. Through a combination of lecture and
interactive seminar, students will have the opportunity to learn about
multiple aspects of the past \- intellectual, cultural, social, political, and
religious. As a course designed for history majors and minors, this course
will emphasize understanding of the historical process, and use of the skills
of the historian with both secondary and primary source material, as
background for mastery of this particular region and time period.

**_Course Objectives  
_** 1\.     The course will provide students with a sound knowledge base about
European history from the late 1400s to the late 18th century, including
specialized knowledge about certain topics.  
2\.     The course will increase student awareness of the complexity of the
past, and increase their ability to synthesize, analyze, and make connections.  
3\.     The course will help students develop the ability to engage in

4\.     The course will expect students to demonstrate ability to write

2)     Grading options A and B will be discussed during the first week of
class. Be sure you understand.

3)     **Attendance** is _EXPECTED_. You are expected to come on time and
prepared to contribute to intelligent and thoughtful discussions. You are
responsible (in discussions, exercises, exams, and other written work) for all
material presented or discussed in class and covered in the syllabus. If you
miss a sign-up sheet or an individual assignment, it is your responsibility to
see me about it.

4)     For book reviews and the research paper (depending on whether option A
or B is in effect), a handout will explain the requirements. I use checklists
as I grade essay assignments, and my checklists are available to you ahead of
time if you wish to refer to them as you complete your work.

5)     Reminder: for this (and any) university-level course, you can expect to
work about 2 hours out of class for every hour in class.

6)     **Plagiarism** is the act of using someone else's exact words, or
extensively paraphrasing someone else's ideas, as if they were yours (that is,
without giving credit to the author, book, or person you are "stealing" from).
Plagiarism is not allowed, and results in an F on an assignment. You risk
failing the course as well .

7)     **If you need assistance** in understanding anything on this syllabus,
or in fulfilling any of the requirements for the course, please see me. Any
student eligible for and needing academic adjustments or accommodations
because of a specific physical, psychiatric, or learning disability is
requested to speak with me about it _no later than the end of the second week
of classes_. I hope to see all of you regularly in my office as we explore
history together.

8)     Please note that, if you live off campus and your home phone has caller
ID and does not accept unblocked calls, you cannot be called from a campus
phone, including my office phone. If you leave me a message to call you, I
will not be able to do so. Phones on the campus system cannot be unblocked.

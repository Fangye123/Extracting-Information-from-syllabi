**Course Perspective**

Interest in computer science and the use of computer applications, together
with connections to many real-world situations, have helped make topics of
[discrete
mathematics](http://forum.swarthmore.edu/workshops/sum96/discrete/intro.html)
more commonplace in school and college curricula. A topic of widespread
application and interest is
[combinatorics](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/CandO_Dept/comb.html), the study
of counting techniques.

> Enumeration, or counting, may strike one as an obvious process that a
student learns when first studying arithmetic. But then, it seems, very little
attention is paid to further developments in counting as the student turns to
"more difficult" areas in mathematics, such as algebra, geometry,
trigonometry, and calculus. . . . Enumeration [however] does not end with
arithmetic. It also has applications in such areas as coding theory,
probability, and statistics (in mathematics) and in the analysis of algorithms
(in computer science). [Ralph P. Grimaldi, in **Discrete and Combinatorial
Mathematics** , 1994, p. 3]

>

> Combinatorial Analysis is an area of mathematics concerned with solving
problems for which the number of possibilities is finite (though possibly
quite large). These problems may be broken into three main categories:
determining existence, counting, and optimization. Sometimes it is not clear
whether a problem has a solution or not. This is a question of existence. In
other cases solutions are known to exist, but we want to know how many there
are. This is a counting problem. Or a solution may be desired that is "best"
in some sense. This is an optimization problem. [John A. Dossey, Albert D.
Otto, Lawrence E. Spence, & Charles Vanden Eynden, in **Discrete Mathematics**
, 1987, p. 1]

Documents that support the reform of school mathematics education suggest the
need for increased attention to topics in discrete mathematics as well as in
probability and statistics. The topic of combinatorics--counting--is mentioned
in the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics' [Curriculum and Evaluation
Standards for School
Mathematics](http://standards.nctm.org/Previous/CurrEvStds/index.htm) (1989)
and in [Principles and Standards for School
Mathematics](http://standards.nctm.org/document/index.htm) (2000). The
[Mathematical Association of America's](http://www.maa.org) recommendations
for teacher preparation identify combinatorics as a topic area worthy of study
by middle school and high school teachers.

In this course we will study and apply combinatorial techniques in a variety
of settings. In doing so, we will make connections to algebra, probability,
geometry, number theory, and many other topics in mathematics. During the
course, we may also study the process of [proof by
induction](http://forum.swarthmore.edu/epigone/mathedu/blinblehhand/Pine.GSO.3.95.970206124206.10136A-100000@arctic),
the use of recursion, and the generation of polynomials.

Textbook**  
The course text is _Mathematics of Choice_ by Ivan Niven, published in 1965 by
Random House. The bookstores have copies of the text. You may also purchase
the book online from the [Mathematical Association of
America](http://www.maa.org/pubs/books/nml15.html) (ISBN 0-88385-615-8, List:
$18.50 MAA Member: $14.95 Catalog Number: NML-15/W).

**Course Requirements and Grading Scale**  
Problem Sets  & Quizzes (10%)  
These will be daily assignments and occasional quizzes during the course.  
  
Tests (3 @ 20%)  
Three exams will be given during the course.  
The tests are tentatively scheduled for the last day of each week of class,
typically a Thursday. Part or all of one or more exams may be a take-home
exam. Specific restrictions for such take-home portions will be stated when
the take-home portion is distributed.  
  
Final Examination (30%)  
A comprehensive course exam will be completed Thursday, 12 July, during the
regularly scheduled hours for class.  
  
Course grades are based on these requirements. I will use a distribution _no
more severe_ than A: 92-100%, B: 84-91%, C: 76-83%, D: 68-76%, F:  <68%.

Please refer to the [grade guidelines](gradeguide.html) for additional
information on grade determination and expectations. There also is information
on [my expectations for your submission of work](samples.html) in the course.

**Available Resources**  
Course materials are available electronically through a World-wide Web home
page for the course. Computers in STV 314/322 run _Netscape_ and _Internet
Explorer_ ,Internet software you can use to access the World-wide Web.
Computers outside the department can be used to access the course home page
using the Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
[http://www.math.ilstu.edu/~day/courses/current/305](http://www.math.ilstu.edu/~day/courses/current/305).

STV 302 is open regularly for student use. There are multiple copies of many
books, booklets, pamphlets, and journals. You may use the materials there or
check them out on a limited basis.  
  
**Attendance, Make-up Work, and Extra Credit**  
Your active involvement--individually, in small groups, and with the entire
class--is an important way for you to help meet the course objectives. For you
to be involved, you must be present. If you are now aware of attendance
conflicts or should you become aware of such conflicts, please let me know of
them as soon as possible.

The deadlines, due dates, and test dates described in the written course
requirements and announced during class are just that. Plan ahead to complete
the required tasks on time; be prepared for quizzes, tests, and the course
exam. Make-up work is negotiated on an individual basis only under emergency
situations.

The course requirements are designed to meet the objectives of the course.
Unless announced otherwise, there is no extra credit as a substitute for
successful completion of the required components of the course.

I invite and appreciate your comments and suggestions for the course as it
unfolds. Please share with me in person or in writing your reactions and
perceptions. Your contributions will serve to enhance the course for you, your
classmates, and future students.

COURSE REQUIREMENTS  
The course is assessed in three distinct ways as follows:-

1\. Participation in class debate and oral presentations of readings and film
screenings. Every week there is a piece of reading for all class members as
preparation for the upcoming session. A different student in rotation will be
asked to make detailed preparation of ideas to present to the class on this
material and on the film screening. 25%

2\. 2 essays of approximately 2,000 words in which a film, director, movement,
technical, political, aesthetic or economic element is explored which relates
to the ideas raised on the course. This makes up the final 50%.

3\. Students will be given group research tasks at the beginning of the course
that must be formally presented to the whole group at a later date. This
represents a further 25% in terms of assessment. 25%. Details of these tasks
will be given out in the first session.

4\. In addition, students are required to attend both the screening and
teaching sessions each week. Any absence must be excused in advance.

5\. Each student must buy copies of the course companion books: British Cinema
of the 1980's by John Hill, (Oxford University Press 1999) and British Cinema
of the 90's edited by Robert Murphy, (BFI 2000).

  
ESSAY SPECIFICATIONS  
1\. Essays must be word-processed, double-spaced and include a full
bibliography.  
2\. The required length is 2,000 words. Please total the number of words at
the end. You will be penalised for falling outside the word limit by more than
300 words.  
3\. Completed essays may be handed in personally, sent to my home address: 10
Winterbrook Road, London SE24 9JA, or to my e-mail address:
hewingwb@btinternet.com. It is important that you meet the deadlines that are
set. Failure to do so may result in the deduction of marks.  
4\. For research purposes you may use the British Film Institute Library at 21
Stephen Street, London W1 (0207-255-1444). See the Assistant Director for
Student Life for details.  
5\. Any problems you might have with essays or anything else pertaining to the
course should be discussed with me as soon as possible in my office hour
before class begins.  

  
SUGGESTED ESSAY TITLES  
1\. "The heritage cycle and its particular representation of the national past
is in many ways symptomatic of cultural developments in Thatcherite Britain."
(Andrew Higson, 'British Cinema and Thatcherism'.) How far does 'A Room With A
View' lend itself to this assertion?  
2\. Mike Leigh prides himself on 'showing people as they really are'. How far
do you agree?  
3\. Stephen Frears and Hanif Kureishi were accused of 'washing Asian dirty
linen in public'. Is this true in relation to My Beautiful Laundrette?  
4\. Mona Lisa: new departure or stereotype?  
5\. How did Thatcherism redefine British cinema?  
6\. Is Neil Jordan an auteur?  
7\. What do you consider are the finer points of Ken Loach's work?  
8\. What do British crime films say about British culture and character?  
9\. Compare and contrast Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral.  
10\. Why was Trainspotting so successful?  
11\. The Full Monty establishes the possibility of 'the female gaze'. Using
close textual reference, illustrate how this can be argued.  
12\. Compare two or more films from the course in terms of their
representation of one of the following: social class, masculinity, femininity,
sexuality, race or location.  
13\. Which of the films you have seen have been the most interesting in terms
of style? Illustrate using a number of films.  
14\. How would you describe the British aesthetic?

*N.B. You may reword these titles and/or write your own provided that you have my agreement before you proceed. The deadline for first essay is Week 6.

**Course Description:**  
This course is for students who are currently in a graduate program in
archaeology or are considering entering such a program, either here at UWM or
elsewhere. It is intended to provide a roadmap and survival guide for the
world of professional archaeology, in its various manifestations. Whether you
choose as your eventual venue to work in CRM archaeology, the museum, or the
university setting, the skills you will need will include grant-writing, the
presentation of research results in oral and written form, and the publication
of research in the form of reports, articles, or books. However, each of these
areas of professional archaeological activity also has its own culture, with
its own specific requirements for successful participation. Negotiating the
intricacies of the terrain of each of these cultures is greatly aided by
advance knowledge of the expectations and procedures associated with
membership. This course will attempt to prepare you, through practical
applications and discussion, for success in any of the three possible
professional archaeological  "cultures". Although the academic trajectory will
be emphasized, reference will be made to the other two contexts within which
archaeological research is conducted.  
  
**Course Format:**  
The course will consist primarily of discussion and student critiques of each
other's work, with intermittent expositions by the instructor, usually when a
new topic is introduced, and at the beginning of each class. The emphasis is
on the sharing and pooling of knowledge - each member of the class will be
bringing a different set of experiences and perspectives to the table. Active
participation both in class and in the written assignments are required, and
the goal should be for each student to produce a set of funding proposals and
research topic outlines that will become the foundation for actual work after
the class is over. Each student should establish a notebook, preferably in
loose-leaf binder form, and bring this to class each week.

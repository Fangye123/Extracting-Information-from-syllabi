_Course Description_ : The multinational corporation is an institution
existing within the interstices of the fields of industrial organization,
international economics, macroeconomics, management studies, and international
political economy. As such, it is often treated as an "exception" to the rules
derived from neoclassical economic theory. This course examines (1) how MNCs
are reorganizing global production and trade, (2) a variety of theoretical
approaches to explaining the MNC and how it fits into or shapes the larger
economic picture, and (3) the impact of MNC activities on home and host
countries and the distribution of income.

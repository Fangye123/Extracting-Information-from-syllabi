#  Text

The main text is **Quantum Physics of Atoms, Molecules, Solids, Nuclei and
Particles, 2nd edition** by Robert Eisberg and Robert Resnick. Lectures will
largely follow the text, with some deviations. In addition to the main text,
the following books are on reserve at the POA library:

**The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Volume III,** by R.P. Feynman

**Quantum Physics,** by S. Gasiorowicz

**Modern Physics and Quantum Mechanics,** by E. Anderson

* * *

#  Requirements and Grading

The final grade will be determined as follows:

* **50% Homework.** There will be weekly homework assignments, which will usually be due in class on Thursday. Late homework will receive a penalty of 10% per day. Homework turned in after class on the due date will be considered one day late. _Homework will not be accepted later than five days past the original due date._ Homework solutions will be put on reserve in the POA library.

* **20% Midterm Exam.** There will be one mid-term exam at a date to be announced.

**[Dr. Perle's Home page](../index.html)**

**Catalog Description:**

This course is a continuation of Technique 612. Students continue to refine
their assessment and adjustive skills and are introduced to additional
adjusting procedures. Students are also introduced to extremity adjustive
procedures. Selected spinal and extremity conditions are presented.

**Course Objectives:**

I. To reinforce clinical decision making skills

II. To further refine the students skills to physically handle a patient.

III. To further develop the student's affective, cognitive and psycho-motor
diagnostic skills to identify spinal joint dysfunction.

IV. Perform and interpret a basic chiropractic analysis of the spine enabling
the student to determine where, why and how to specifically adjust the patient
in a manner appropriate to the chiropractic and physical

V. Perform a competent history relating to the spine and derive a rational
working diagnosis from which to develop an appropriate examination and
treatment protocol.

VI. Demonstrate, discuss and explain the use of the chiropractic table and its
ability to functionally facilitate and aid the doctor in the deliverance and
execution of a particular adjustive maneuver.

VII. To develop the psychomotor skills needed to deliver an appropriate
chiropractic manipulative thrust (adjustment) to the spine. Appropriate in
this context means: the treatment is rendered for restriction of motion in a
motion segment, treatment rendered in the correct direction to restore the
restricted motion and treatment rendered with an adequate velocity, force and
amplitude of thrust.

VIII. To know the contraindications to manipulation.

IX. To develop a rational treatment program for conditions/syndromes
associated with the spine.

**Teaching Strategy:**

Lecture, problem-based case management, selected audio-visual aids, class
presentation and hands on application of procedures taught.

**Evaluation Methods**

**Testing Methods:**

Multiple choice examinations (2) Practical Examinations (2)

**Practical Examinations**

Practical examinations will be conducted using check off sheets. Students will
be provided with the check off sheets prior to the examinations. Failure to
attempt to perform any item in the rows to the left of a point value will
result in zero (0) points for the whole group of rows. For example (see
section of check off sheet below) failure to maintain right knee extension
will result in a grade of 0 out of 40 on this portion of the test. If, however
the students attempts to perform any item in the rows to the left of a grade
the resulting grade will be a proportional decrease in the possible grade. For
example, if one attempts to maintain right knee extension but fails to do so
adequately one's grade would be reduced by 13 points.

Doctor stretches patient very rapidly |  |  |  
  
**Grading:**

Grades based upon results of practical midterm exam (20% of final grade),
written midterm exam (20% of final grade), practical final examination (3% of
final grade) comprehensive written final exam (30% of final grade).

**NOTE** :

  * If the grade of the practical midterm is less than a "C" the final practical will be comprehensive.
  * For all students, the final practical examination must be passed with a grade of a "C" or better in order to pass this course. If a grade of less than a "C" is earned on the final practical exam, a makeup examination must be taken no later than one week after the last day of the term, otherwise the final grade will be an "F".

  
A 90-100%  
B+ 85-89.9%  
B 80-84.9%  
C+ 75-79.9%  
C 70-74.9%  
D 60-69.9%  
F 0-59.9% **Policy and Procedures**

**Makeup Examinations/Quizzes:**

A make up test or quiz will be given only upon submission of a documentation
of a religious holiday that prevents attendance on the date of the
examination. Failure to do so will result in a grade of zero for the test(s)
in question.

To be eligible for a makeup examination a student must do all of the
following:  
1\. Present valid documentation  
2\. Fill out a **Request for Makeup Test Form** and submit same to the
instructor.  
3\. Take a makeup within seven calendar days from the scheduled testing day.  
4\. Keep the appointed makeup test date.

It is the responsibility of the student to see the instructor so that a makeup
can be scheduled by the instructor for a time within one week of the scheduled
exam date, that does not conflict with the student's class schedule.  


**Tardiness for Test/Quizzes:**

If a student is late for a test or quiz, they will be allowed to take the
test/quiz only if no other student has finished the test and left the room.

**Attendance:**

Attendance will be taken at each class meeting. Any student that arrives late
in excess of 15 minutes or leaves early will be considered absent for that
class. A student absent more than 10% of the class meetings without a valid
excuse may have their grade lowered one letter grade. Excuses require
documentation. Excused absences are limited to religious holidays. A student
absent, **for any reason** , 20% or more of the class meetings will fail the
class.

**Dress in Class:**

All students are expected to either wear a shirt/gown that is can be opened in
the back or to completely remove their shirt for laboratory. **Any student not
appropriately dressed will be considered absent for that class.**

Description: This course examines topics that often
receive little attention in international relations courses:
norms, ethics, and gender. The first half of the course will
focus on the morality and legality of warfare.  The second half
will focus on international human rights and gender
issues.  Specific topics to be covered include the just war
tradition, war crimes, racism and war, nuclear ethics, human
rights and cultural relativism, masculinity and nationalism, sex
and sexism in international relations, and feminist IR theory.
Reading Materials: Readings are assigned from the
following course books, all available at the University
Bookstore:

Paul Christopher (1994). The Ethics of War and Peace: An
Introduction to Legal and Moral Issues (Englewood Cliffs, NJ:
Prentice Hall).
Michael Walzer (1992). Just and Unjust Wars: A Moral
Argument With Historical Illustrations, second edition (New
York: Basic Books).
John W. Dower (1986). War Without Mercy: Race and Power in
the Pacific War (New York: Pantheon).
R.J. Vincent (1986). Human Right and International
Relations (New York: Cambridge University Press).
Cynthia Enloe (1989). Beaches, Bananas, and Bases: Making
Feminist Sense of International Politics (Berkeley:
University of California Press).
J. Ann Tickner (1992). Gender in International Relations:
Feminist Perspectives on Achieving Global Security (New York:
Columbia University Press).

Reading is an important part of this course.  Assigned selections
should be read carefully before each class, for two reasons. 
First, we will be examining controversial topics in international
relations, and this will make for some heated discussions.  You
will be much more effective in arguing your point of view if you
are familiar with the assigned readings. Second, some of the
assigned reading material is difficult to get through.  The
concepts, theories, and arguments are subtle and sophisticated,
and can be difficult to comprehend. Class discussion will provide
an opportunity to work through points of confusion and
misunderstanding, as well as disagreement.
Requirements and Evaluation: There will be two
examinations during the semester, both of them take-home essays
of 6-7 pages in length.  The midterm exam will cover issues
surrounding the morality and legality of warfare, and will
constitute 30 percent of your final grade.  The final will
cover human rights and gender, and will constitute 35 percent of
your grade.  You will also be asked to write a 5-page book review
of Dower's War Without Mercy, for 20 percent of your
grade.  The remaining 15 percent will be based on your
participation in class discussion, including an occasional
oral report on one of the reading assignments.
One last note: Academic dishonesty includes cheating,
plagiarism, unauthorized possession of examinations, and
alteration of grades or markings on returned work.  When in doubt
about plagiarism, paraphrasing, quoting, or collaboration,
consult the instructor.  Any examination or assignment tainted
by academic dishonesty will automatically receive a grade of
F. University regulations require that the incident be
reported to the chair of the Department of Political Science and
to the Provost, who will determine the appropriateness of further
disciplinary action.

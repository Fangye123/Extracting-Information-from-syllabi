Prof. Richard Saunders -- 200-A Holtzendorff -- 656-5373
TO CONTACT ME: Come by during regular office hours Mondays and
Wednesdays 1:30-4:30 and Tuesdays, 9:30-11 and 12:30-4:30. Call if you
want to talk--office phone is 656-5373 and home phone is 654-2841 (no calls
after 11, please). E-mail is airedal@clemson.edu, but it is a poor way
to reach me as I read it only about once a week--sometimes go six weeks
or more without reading it. Don't expect a quick response on e-mail.
If I am delayed before class, please have the courtesy to wait 5
minutes, or until someone from the department instructs you.
READING:
Colin Davis, Power at Odds; The 1922 Railroad Shopmen's
Strike
David Hamilton, ed. The New Deal
Akira Iriye, Pearl Harbor and the Coming of the Pacific
War
These books are available at the local bookstores and from internet
sources. You are free to share copies with each other, but if you wait
until the weekend before the due date to make arrangements for these books,
it will be too late and late penalties will apply.
REQUIREMENTS:
1. Pass the midterm and final examinations.
2.. Satisfy the attendance requirement described below.
3. Submit three reports described below.
EXAMINATIONS:
    There will be a midterm and a final. Both will be
primarily essay examinations that test both knowledge, a function of work,
and understanding, a function of both work and talent. Grading is based
on the accuracy and completeness of your information, the clarity of your
expression and your ability to use evidence to reach a conclusion.
GRADES:
    Final grades are a matter of judgment. To guide
me in that judgment, the papers will count 15% each, the midterm 250% and
the final 30%.
ATTENDANCE:
     This is a lecture course. There is
no substitute for being present and thinking, for 50 minutes, about the
subject at hand. Getting notes from a friend can plug a few holes but not
much more.
    You may take 6 cuts. There is no specific penalty
on those 6 cuts, although my willingness to give the benefit of the doubt
begins to wane the higher the number gets. Whatever subject matter or announcements
you miss is your responsibility. These cuts are meant for university activities
(including athletics), illness, family emergencies, job interviews, or
whatever--it is your business. There is no distinction between "excused"
or any other absences. Cutting class on Monday, Nov. 19 counts as three
cuts. More than six cuts, a C is the maximum grade you can get
for the course. Over ten cuts, D is the maximum grade. A wise person
will save a cut or two in case the flu strikes or an uncle dies late in
the semester. I am doing my best to give you a great course; I think I
tolerate many student foibles, but cutting is not one.
    In very rare cases such as a hospitalized
illness late in the semester, you may plead for special consideration,
but exceptions will be considered only for students whose average in the
class is at least a mid-C at the time their special troubles began, and
only for those who can explain every cut, not just the one or two that
went over the limit. Remember, I have a record of the exact dates you cut,
so your records will have to tally.
PAPERS:
    You will write three papers. Minimum length is 5
pages each, typed doubled spaced in normal font size or the equivalent.
Minimum length papers do not usually earn maximum grades.
    The papers are book reports on each of the assigned
books. Read the book and write a paper about it. What is so hard about
that? However, for those who are going for an A grade, it is important
to put the subject of the book in a larger context of the situation developed
in class. In other words, put it in the big picture.
    Papers are due at class time. There is a grace period
until 4:30 that afternoon. Late papers are docked a letter grade until
the on-time papers are given back (no 4:30 grace period). After that, late
papers get a maximum grade of C. If one of these reports is not
turned in at all, the maximum grade for the course is a D. If more than
one is not turned in, there is no point taking the final. No papers
will be accepted after 4:30 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 7, the last day of class.
No exceptions/no tears.

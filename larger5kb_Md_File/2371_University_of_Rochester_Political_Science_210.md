**BASIC REQUIREMENTS** Political Science 210, History 257  
These requirements apply only to those NOT receiving upper-level writing
credit.  

**Class attendance and participation (15%). ** Students are expected to attend
lectures and recitations on a regular basis. The baseline participation grade
is determined by participation in recitations. For most students who attend
lectures regularly but do not speak up much the recitation grade will be
recorded as the participation grade. Recitation grades will be revised upward
for students who not only attend lectures regularly but also speak up in
lectures. Recitation grades will be sharply lowered for students who do not
attend lectures regularly.

**Three or four short papers (35% total).** In 500-700 words (about 2 pages),
students should address three (or four) of the paper questions listed in the
hard-copy syllabus. Keep papers short and to the point. No paper may exceed
750 words. Double-space the papers, use 12-point fonts, and no funny stuff
with the margins; an inch on each side is about right. Students may write
papers for any three (or four) of the units, though all students must submit a
paper in at least one of the first three units. In calculating the course
grade, all paper grades will be included. (In the case of students who fail to
submit a paper in at least one of the first three units, the grade of "0" will
be assigned to the missing paper. These students will still be responsible for
writing three additional papers.) Place your recitation leader's name at the
top of your paper.  Papers are due in Professor Gamm's box in Harkness 314 no
later than 10:00 on Wednesday mornings (except for the paper due in class on
Tuesday, April 6). No late papers will be accepted without prior permission.
Students must submit at least three papers to receive credit for the course.

**Midterm exam (15%).** The exam will be administered in class on February 23.  
**Final exam (35%).** Students must take the final exam to receive credit for
the course.  

**Optional research paper.** The paper, which should be 10-12 pages in length,
must address a question raised in the course and pursue that question through
outside reading or research; though some primary work is encouraged, it is not
required. Students may bring in early drafts of the paper for comments. For
students submitting a research paper, the midterm exam will count 10% of the
course grade, the final exam will count 20%, and the research paper will count
20%. Students who are considering writing the final paper should meet with
Professor Gamm within the next few weeks to get help finding a good paper
topic; after receiving his approval, students must submit their written paper
topics (5-7 sentences) no later than March 5.

Final papers are due by 4:30 on Wednesday, April 28, in Professor Gamm's box
in Harkness 314.

**UPPER-LEVEL WRITING REQUIREMENTS ** Political Science 210w, History 257w -
These requirements apply ONLY to those receiving UPPER-LEVEL WRITING CREDIT
and registered in Political Science 210w or History 257w.

**Class attendance and participation (15%).** Students are expected to attend
lectures and recitations on a regular basis. The baseline participation grade
is determined by participation in recitations. For most students-who attend
lectures regularly but do not speak up much-the recitation grade will be
recorded as the participation grade. Recitation grades will be revised upward
for students who not only attend lectures regularly but also speak up in
lectures. Recitation grades will be sharply lowered for students who do not
attend lectures regularly.

**Eight short papers (60% total). ** In 500-700 words (about 2 pages),
students should address eight of the paper questions listed in the hard-copy
syllabus. Keep papers short and to the point. No paper may exceed 750 words.
Double-space the papers, use 12-point fonts, and no funny stuff with the
margins; an inch on each side is about right. Students may write papers for
any eight of the eleven units, though all students must submit a paper in at
least three of the first five units. In calculating the course grade, the
seven best paper grades will be included. (In the case of students who fail to
submit papers in at least three of the first five units, the grade of "0" will
be assigned to any missing paper. These students will still be responsible for
writing at least seven papers.) Place your recitation leader's name at the top
of your paper. Papers are due in Professor Gamm's box in Harkness 314 no later
than 10:00 on Wednesday mornings (except for the paper due in class on
Tuesday, April 6). No late papers will be accepted without prior permission.
Students must submit at least seven papers to receive credit for the course.

**Rewrite.** Any paper (except the last paper) may be rewritten within the two
weeks after the original draft has been graded and returned. The original
graded paper must be attached when the rewrite is submitted. Grades received
on the two versions of the paper will each constitute half the paper's grade.
Students must rewrite one paper to receive credit for the course.

**Final exam (25%).** Students must take the final exam to receive credit for
the course.  

**Optional research paper. ** The paper, which should be 10-12 pages in
length, must address a question raised in the course and pursue that question
through outside reading or research; though some primary work is encouraged,
it is not required. Students may bring in early drafts of the paper for
comments. For students submitting a research paper, the eight short papers
will count 50% of the course grade, the final exam will count 171/2%, and the
research paper will count 171/2%. Students who are considering writing the
final paper should meet with Professor Gamm within the next few weeks to get
help finding a good paper topic; after receiving his approval, students must
submit their written paper topics (5-7 sentences) no later than March 5.

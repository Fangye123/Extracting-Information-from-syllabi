_Course Description_

This is a topical and analytical survey of Latin American history. This course
will focus on the historical development of Latin American societies. Among
the themes we will discuss are race and class relations, revolution and
rebellion, and the challenges of underdevelopment.

_Course Objectives_

Students will become familiar with the major political, social, economic, and
cultural trends in Latin American history. In the process they will develop
the ability to evaluate and critically discuss historical materials. Students
will learn to analyze and synthesize lectures and reading materials to produce
well-organized and cogently written essays.

_Course Requirements_

  * Students are expected to attend all lectures and complete all assigned readings. 
  * Due to the large number of students enrolled in this course, the class will be conducted chiefly in lecture format. This means that all students will benefit most from this class by remaining attentive and alert. I will make every effort to provide a comfortable, intellectually stimulating environment in which you can learn. Out of consideration for others in the class, please refrain from eating, talking, reading newspapers, or napping during class time. Similarly, please try to arrive on time and plan to remain throughout the entire class period. If you must leave early, please notify me prior to class and sit in a location from which your early departure will not distract others. 
  * Student participation is encouraged. Active learning involves a dialogue between the instructor and students. If you have a question or require clarification during the lecture, please feel free to ask. The answer to your question may be helpful to others in the class as well. If you think that your question requires in-depth discussion or a more detailed answer, please feel free to contact me by e-mail or come to my office to discuss it further. 
  * Students should plan to devote an average of 6 to 9 hours per week in preparation time in addition to 3 hours per week in class attendance. 
  * Students are _strongly_ encouraged to set up an e-mail account (campus e-mail accounts are available at no charge) and check it frequently. 
  * Students are responsible for obtaining lecture notes/handouts from fellow classmates in the event of an absence. Absences due to scheduled university activities, health problems, or serious family emergencies (such as the illness of a child or a death in the family) will be excused IF they are documented with a note from an appropriate professional (physician, funeral director, athletics department advisor, etc.). 

_Attendance Policy_

Students are advised that attendance will be taken frequently (or even daily)
throughout the semester at the discretion of the instructor. This information
will be used to calculate the overall student's attendance grade. Students can
earn a total of 50 points for attendance; students with three (3) or fewer
unexcused absences will earn the full 50 attendance points. For each
additional unexcused absence, 5 points will be deducted from the student's
attendance score.

_Examination Policy_

  * Objective testing of course content will be assessed by on-line "webtests" that will be due on a weekly basis. In-class essay exams will be used to assess student progress and development of critical thinking and writing skills. 
  * Four "units" will be covered in this course. Each unit grade will be made up of three webtests (3 @ 10 full points each = 30 points possible) plus the in-class essay examinations for each unit (70 points possible per test). Exams and quizzes may NOT be made up unless the student provides documentary evidence as described in the above section.

_Webtests_

  * There will be twelve (12) webtests given during this semester. Webtests may be accessed via the internet from any location. You will log on to create your webtest account during the first week of classes, and you will use that account name and password throughout the semester. 
  * Your webtests will be graded by the computer, which will keep your scores and old tests available for your review at any time during the semester. YOU are responsible for making sure that your graded test scores are included in the gradebook. If you have any problems with your computer during the testing process, you should check your webtest gradebook immediately to verify that your score has been recorded by the computer. You may review your grades and old webtests at any time throughout the semester. You may also print out your webtests for review and study. 
  * Note: A webtest score of 20 (perfect) is worth 10 full points toward your grade. A passing grade is 80% or 16 points (worth 8 full points). Since your course grade is dependent on total points earned, working toward perfect scores on all webtests will be a good way to improve your overall grade. 
  * You may re-take the webtests until the deadline date/time to improve your score; you will receive your highest score. You will have 1.5 weeks in which to take each webtest. Below you will find a schedule by which you should complete each of the tests. You will note that each webtest deadline is on a Friday at 5:00 p.m. 
  * To earn one full **extra credit** point, you should complete the webtest by 9:00 a.m. on the Thursday before the deadline. (Note: Use the links in the chart below to log on for your webtests.) 
  * Instructions are available at <http://www.math.unl.edu/webtests/docs/student_guide.pdf>. See me if you have any questions. The Gateway Web-Testing System is provided by _[Dr. John Lindsay Orr](mailto:jorr@math.unl.edu)_ and the _UNL Department of Mathematics and Statistics_.

_Academic Honesty_

College and university regulations regarding academic misconduct, as set forth
in the Student Code of Conduct and other university documents and
publications, will be enforced. Any incident of academic dishonesty will be
grounds for failing the course; students who believe they have been unfairly
graded may appeal their grade following standard university procedures.

NOTE: This syllabus is an outline only, and is subject to change at the
discretion of the professor. If you have _any_ questions whatsoever concerning
the course content, requirements, materials, grading, etc., please talk to me
as soon as possible. Feel free to come and see me during office hours. This is
especially important if you are having difficulty in the course. If my office
hours conflict with your schedule, see me before or after any class period to
make an appointment for some other mutually agreeable time.

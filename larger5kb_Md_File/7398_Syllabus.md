                    Purpose of this Course:

                                    This course provides a survey of European history from the French Revolution to the present day and satisfies the second   
                                     semester of the university's core history requirement.  The class explores the political restructuring  of first Western   
                                    Europe then Russia and later the Third World under the pressures of the modern population explosion and the Industrial   
                                    Revolution.We then go on to examine the political outcome of these developments: the emergence of the national security   
                                    state at the end of the nineteenth century, a state engaged in the constant preparation of war, a phenomenon that gave rise   
                                    to the World Wars and Cold War of the Twentieth Century.  We will pay say special attention to gender relations, the   
                                    French and Industrial Revolutions, militarism, the New Imperialism, the World Wars, Communism, Fascism, the Cold War   
                                    and its demise, European economic integration, and "the social market economy," the unique form of capitalism that   
                                    evolved in Western Europe after World War II, which seems destined to play a major role in the 21st Century.

                                    Assignments are designed to develop students' reading, writing, listening, and analytical skills in addition to acquainting   
                                   them with the most important historical developments of the last two centuries through lectures, readings, films, written   
                                    assignments,and use the Internet.

                                        you want to  make your Communist a member of the artistic avant-garde like the Russian poet Mayakovsky for fun,   
                                        do so, but also indicate what kinds of people were the most likely to support Bolshevism and why someone like   
                                        Mayakovsky and other modernists might identify with this movement.

                                    e) **There will also be a mid-term and a final examination, based on study questions.   These two exams will be weighed**

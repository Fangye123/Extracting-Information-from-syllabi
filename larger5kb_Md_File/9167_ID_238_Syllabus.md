  **Course Goals and Procedures**

This is a course on the nature of war: its causes and effects, its practice,
and prevetability. It is also a course on peace and its achievability. While
war and peace is the principle theme of the class, we will also be concerned
with several substantial topics:

  * Ethics in context: To what extent is moral reasoning conditioned by historical circumstances? 
  * The relationship between philosophy and history: To what extent are the methods of philosophy and history interrelated? How do they differ? 
  * Human nature and Ethics: To what extent is the philosophy of human nature (our concepts of desire, reason, appetite, will, consciousness, individual identity, intelligence, emotion, gender, ethnicity, our animal nature) related to our ethics? Which, if any, should have primacy? 
  * Religion, Peace, and War: To what extent are concepts and arguments on war and peace indebted to religious beliefs and practice? How might religious resources be drawn upon in articulating an ethic of war and peace? 
  * Law and International Law: What is the foundation for law? What are the grounds for natural law?

The course will be conducted in a Socratic fashion, with the emphasis on
discussion and exchange as opposed to straight lectures. It will therefore
require each class member to engage in class discussion with respect for
others, other class members themselves as well as the points of view
expressed.

  **Assignments and Grading**

There will be two formal paper assignments, the first an analytical essay of
at least 5 pages due on October 18, and the second a major paper of at least
15 pages, involving independent research into a topic of your own choice, due
on December 12. You will receive further details for both assignments at the
appropriate time, but you may wish to begin thinking about possible topics for
the final paper as the semester progresses. In addition, you are asked to
complete one to two-page response papers on the days indicated, addressing the
reading assignments for those days. These papers will supplement your class
participation grade, which will also take into account attendance and
involvement in class discussions. Finally, there will be an in-class final
examination, consisting of an essay evaluating the evolution of your thinking
about war and peace over the course of the semester.

Grades will be distributed as follows: Class grade (including response
papers): 25%; first paper: 25%; second paper: 40%; final examination: 10%.

  **Readings and Topics**  
_This is a provisional schedule; it may be altered as the course proceeds._

**Thursday, September 7: Introductions**  
Opening comments on the nature of philosophy, history, and the project of
carrying out an inquiry into the concept and substance of war --the causes and
effects of war, its nature and practice, and its preventability, as well as
inquiry into the concept and substance of peace --the causes and effects of
peace, its nature and practice, and its achievability. Introductions of class
members, and info collected: name, major (if any), background and prior
interests in philosophy, history, war, peace, or any area that may have a
bearing on this course.

**Tuesday, September 12: Is peace logically prior to war?**  
A section from Augustine's _The City of God_ and _Instincts and Human
Passions_ by Eric Fromm (From The Anatomy of Human Destructiveness) We shall
look at some of the fundamental concepts that come into play in explaining
intentional action and values. To what extent must any action be motivated by
what the agent thinks of as good or desirable? Is the pursuit of what is
deemed evil for its own sake intelligible? What is the role of desire,
intentionality, reason, and memory in human nature? Our goal will be to map
out some alternative accounts of human nature and to examine some of the
evidence for these accounts.

**Thursday, September 14: The Heroic Age**  
Reading from Homers _The Iliad_ and _The Song of Roland_ : _Laisses_ XCI-CXI
(91-111); Virtues and vices in history and myth.  
What makes a hero? How does a hero behave on the field of battle? What kind of
support does he have from the gods? These selections from two epic poems,
about 1800 years apart, treat of themes that are similar in nature. Violence
and bloodshed are especially in evidence here. What is the attraction for an
audience of such passages as these? Do these great works of literature support
or challenge Augustine's point of view? Fromm's?

**_COURSE GRADING_**  
  
Your class attendance is crucial if you are to succeed in this class. Though
you don't have homework assignments to turn in, your threaded discussions and
group project are worth 200 points. You need to plan ahead so your grade is
not affected by such things as computer problems. **Expect your computer to
cause you difficulty**. **Don't try to do your homework the day before it is
due**. Late threaded discussions and participation in your group project WILL
NOT be accepted and are accepted via the Internet only.  
  
All three tests will include information form the both books, videos we view
in class, concepts  & current issues that we discuss in class or read from
newspapers, as well as any other handouts or in-class projects that we work
on. Your weekly attendance is crucial.  
  
1 group project with Washington State University
100 points  
10 Internet Threaded Discussions with WSU (10 points each)               100
points  
2 Exams (worth 100 points each)
200 points  
_1 Comprehensive Final Exam
100 points_  
**Total points possible
500 points**  
  
  
**The grading scale:**

450 - 500     A  
400 - 449     B  
350 - 399     C  
300 - 3349   D  
250 - 299     F  
  
  
**_POLICIES:  _**A syllabus is essentially a contract, so please understand
the following policies.  
  
1. _On time attendance to all class sessions is expected. **Audible pagers or cell phones are prohibited.**_   
  
2\. All _readings must be completed PRIOR to class_ , and you are responsible
for getting all information disseminated.  Tests draw from lectures, videos,
texts, web conversations and anything else that occurs in class or on-line.  
  
3\. _There are no make up exams_.   If you miss ONE exam, the grade on your
final will count for the missed exam.  
  
4\. Class participation will be used to resolve any borderline grades. It is
essential that you adhere to the UH University Code in regards to academic
integrity.  _Cheating_ and plagiarism are subject to the UH disciplinary
process and can include a course grade of F.  
  
5\. The point of these policies is to insure fairness and a good classroom
environment. Be advised that grades reflect both effort and achievement.

### _**Introduction**_ (top)

This course traces the intellectual currents in the historical field of public
administration and its more contemporary companions of public policy and
public management. There are three primary crosscutting perspectives. There
is, first, an historical perspective which is concerned with the chronology
and currency of ideas. Just as important are the historical events propelling
the development of the field both in its intellectual and pragmatic
manifestations. A second perspective is cultural. This perspective illuminates
how concepts are reflections of a distinctive set of values, ideology, and
customs as well as preferred modes of reasoning. In this vein, understanding
the epistemology and ontology of the field is key. The third perspective is
analytical with an emphasis on the authority, justification, value, and
"workability" of ideas; i.e., how they shape our thinking, both normatively
and empirically and both intellectually and pragmatically.

### _**Objectives**_ (top)

The purpose of this course is to introduce doctoral students to the historic
intellectual conversations about the nature and scope of American public
administration, public management, and public policy. This introduction will
facilitate the ability to:

> a. develop a "cognitive map" of the major contributors and their
intellectual relationships;

>

> b. identify the major issues and questions in the field and some of the
answers that have already been given;

>

> c. [develop the ability to think critically, synthetically, and to develop
new theory](Restricted/meaning.html);

>

> d. learn the craft of writing academic papers.

### _**Readings**_ (top)

Required:

The following books are available at the SBX bookstore located on High Street:

Shafritz and Hyde (4th Ed.). _Classics of Public Administration_. (S &H)

Perry, James L. (Ed.) (2nd Ed.). _Handbook of Public Administration._ (HPA)  

Additional readings are available in Fisher Hall Student Lounge (FH) in the
bottom drawer of the file cabinet. If you are going to make photocopies,
please keep the original copies free of tears, folds and 'rabbit-eared' pages
so that the next person has a clean copy from which they can work. The
readings are sorted by date. I have also identified the call number for the
books which generated the larger readings. Just click on the selections for
which the title of the work has been made into a hyperlink. This will allow
you to borrow those books from the library without incurring the cost of
photocopying these larger readings.

### _**Assignments**_ _ ****_ (top)

There are three assignments in this class.

1\. The first assignment is to be prepared to discuss all of the articles
assigned for the class. Most of the the readings tend to be quite short but,
nonetheless, compact and intense. Class discussion will bring out the
subtleties, connections to other works, and the relevance and power of these
ideas for modern practice.

I have made past summaries of readings available to you. If you are interested
in how others have read and critiqued the class assignments or if you need
help in fully understanding the readings, feel free to download these past
summaries. (More instruction on uploading and downloading files are provided
below).

Summaries should be made available by Sunday night to the class so that we
have enough time to read, think about, and formulate our questions before
class.

Each summary should consist of two parts. The first part should be a brief
description of the main points of the reading. This will allow the reader to
quickly identify the main contribution of the work. [Please limit your use of
direct quotes except where necessary](Restricted/meaning.html). The second
part should be a critique of the work. Review [Appendix
1](Restricted/reading.html), below, for advice on how to write up a critique
of your assigned readings. The main goal is, again, to identify what
theoretical contributions are necessary for us to move forward on this issue.
Please do not read the paper when you report out to the class.

To make the copies available to your colleagues, email a copy of your review
in RTF format to everyone in the class (including the prof). Also, please
upload a copy to our working library of reviews.

Please read this document on how to transfer files using email and FTP:
([RTF](Restricted/transfer.rtf)) and ([PDF](Restricted/transfer.pdf)).

2\. The second assignment is to develop a 'theoretical eye' by looking at a
current issue and identifying its latent theory and/or what theoretical
questions may be important to dealing with that issue. We have two such
assignments, one for the second week of the quarter ([October
2](schedule.html#October 2)) and one for the tenth week of the class
([November 27](schedule.html#November 27)). Please use the same approach as
identified above to transfer files to the rest of the class.  

  
3\. The third assignment is to write a manuscript which traces the
intellectual development of an important issue or field of specialization
within public administration. The primary requirement is that this topic be of
interest to you (which usually means that it may have some relationship to
your future dissertation topic). For example, one could trace the development
of computers, budgeting or management science and public policy and
management.

The purpose of this assignment is for you to begin gaining mastery over a
particular subject area in public policy or management. This is a first and
important step in beginning your dissertation work and ultimately, your
professional development as an academic. [Appendix 2](Restricted/writing.html)
gives some suggestions on how you might proceed with this assignment. __ I
strongly encourage you to talk to me or your classmates frequently about your
ideas or doubts. If you do not contact me, I will be contacting you. This is
an iterative, non-linear process, so start learning how to do it. Here are the
due dates:

> 1\. _**October 2**_ \- **One paragraph** description of your topic including
an explanation of the issue, why it is important to study, how it fits in
within your longer career goals; your plan on breaking the writing down into
smaller, more manageable chunks (including dates), and the target journal (and
secondary and tertiary journals should your article be rejected at the primary
target journal).

>

> 2\. _**November 6** _ \- **Rough draft** of complete manuscript

>

> 3\. _**November 27**_ \- **Final Paper** \- Including final plans for
submitting the article for publication.

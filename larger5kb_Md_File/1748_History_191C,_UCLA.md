 This course surveys the origins and historical development of anti-Semitism.
Anti-Semitism has assumed manifold forms in different contexts with perhaps
only one common feature: its malleability. It is the aim of this course to
identify the wide array of expressions and actions that fall under the rubric
of anti-Semitism, as well as to examine the decisive role played by anti-
Semitism in forging new forms of Jewish expression. ****

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:** Midterm exam (1/3), final exam (1/3), and term paper.
Please note that the final exam will not be cumulative, but will cover the
second half of the course. The term paper will focus on a topic of _your_
choosing in consultation with the instructor. Outlines for the paper should be
handed in no later than the sixth week of classes. The final paper should
contain a cogent and well-crafted argument that is supported by careful
research. I also expect that the paper possess proper grammar, spelling, and
citation form. For questions relating to style, please consult The Chicago
Manual of Style.

**READINGS:** Most required readings are contained in the Course Reader. In
the syllabus, I have indicated the page numbers of articles and books included
in the Reader in **bold**. Other readings (marked by *) will be placed on
reserve in a box bearing the instructor's name and course title in the History
Department Reading Room on the sixth floor of Bunche Hall.

For the latter half of the course, please purchase Paul Mendes-Flohr and
Jehuda Reinharz, eds., The Jew in the Modern World. This book will be
available at the ASUCLA Bookstore in mid-October.

Course Description

How do you incorporate the latest ideas in e-learning, performance support,
knowledge management, and communities of practice into the design of systems
that support learning and work performance? Just-in-time (JIT) learning is a
design approach that is particularly appropriate for addressing the needs of
knowledge workers engaged in complex problem solving. This course helps
integrate the concepts of JIT learning into your current practice of designing
performance improvement interventions.

The course is organized into three parts. We begin by defining the concepts of
complex problem-solving and learning-by-doing. We review several examples of
applications that implement learning-by-doing. A model for designing a JIT
learning intervention is examined in depth-- an Electronic Performance Support
System
([EPSS](http://www.itec.sfsu.edu/People/Faculty/cleighton/whatisepss.htm)).
Next, we review techniques for designing and evaluating JIT learning
interventions. Emphasis is given to the areas of instructional design,
software user-interface design, and alternative methods of assessment.
Finally, we look at a theoretical framework for the design of learning-by-
doing systems known as a Cognitive Apprenticeship (Brown, Collins, & Duguid,
1989).

Active participation in small-group design exercises and subsequent
discussions constitute the majority of class time. These exercises require you
to solve a design problem that is related to the week's readings. At the end
of the course the exercises take the form of peer reviews for JIT learning
projects. Discussions in class emphasize how the ideas presented in the
readings apply to the design exercises.

As a cumulative project for the course, you must design a JIT learning
intervention for a complex problem-solving activity. This project may be done
individually or with a partner. Hopefully, this project addresses a
performance improvement issue that currently exists in your work setting. The
design must be based on the model of an EPSS. It should employ the strategies
and techniques of design covered in the course. Your JIT learning intervention
is described in a pair of design papers that together are about 25 pages long
(double-spaced, 12-point font).

ITEC 800, Theoretical Foundations of Instructional Technologies, and ITEC 801,
Instructional Systems Design, are pre-requisites for this course. There is no
courseware development done in this course.

  
Performance and Learning Objectives

  * Define the concepts of complex problem-solving and learning-by-doing
  * Identify the limitations of the ISD model in designing interventions for complex problem-solving
  * Document a case study for an application based on learning-by-doing
  * Examine two models of JIT learning-- a performance support system and a knowledge-based community of practice
  * Design a JIT learning intervention using the Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) model
  * Document the design of a JIT learning intervention in a paper that includes a detailed problem description, definition of components and facilitation roles, and a case scenario example
  * Engage in design reviews of JIT learning interventions with peers
  * Document the design strategies and techniques of a JIT learning intervention.
  * Determine the appropriate roles of an Instructional Designer in designing performance support systems.

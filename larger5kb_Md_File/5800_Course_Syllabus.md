In this course you will study the structure and function of proteins, nucleic
acids, carbohydrates and lipids. You will learn the molecular intricacies of
enzyme catalyzed reactions such as nucleic acid transcription and translation,
and you will gain an understanding of how carbohydrates are utilized to
provide the energy which sustains life. The laboratory will demonstrate many
of the topics which we discuss in lecture and give you a more operational
understanding of many of the topics. The laboratory is also designed to help
you understand how errors get into even carefully performed tests. These
lessons will be important in your practice when you must decide what clinical
tests to have done and how to interpret the results.  
  
You may feel that much of the information you learn is detailed, difficult and
impertinent to the field of chiropractic. Biochemistry, however, has become
one of the basic sciences and the language and concepts you learn in this
course will prepare you for further study in the fields of nutrition,
histology, physiology and microbiology. Several sections on the biochemistry
of bone, cartilage and connective tissue have been included because, in
addition to demonstrating general biochemical principles, they are of direct
relevance to your chosen field of study.

A. Required Text(s):  

  * _**Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry**_ , Nelson and Cox, __3rd Edition, Worth, 2000

You will need a text to clarify and supplement the material covered in
lecture. I recommend _Lehninger_ _Principles of Biochemistry_ which is a good
introductory text and covers all areas of biochemistry. If you feel you have
some background and or aptitude in biochemistry the _Harper's_ or
_Lippincott's_ review texts would be appropriate. They are more concise and
cover the topics related to health and disease in much greater depth.  

  
B. Recommended Text(s):  

  1. Murry, Granner, Mayes and Rodwell, _Harper's Biochemistry_ , 23rd Edition, Lange, 1993 
  2. Champe and Harvey, _Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Biochemistry_ , 2nd Edition, Lippencott, 1994 
  3. Biochemistry WEB Resources. Clicking on the **Resources** link at the top left of the page will take you to a page with tutorial and enrichment material for the topics we are discussing in lecture. I have also included a short section on the clinical significance of each topic. Hopefully this will help you to see the pertinence of the material even though we cannot go into enough depth to master the clinical applications. 
  
C. Required Materials for Lab:  

  1. **_Biochemistry Laboratory Manual_ , **Richardson, J., Kingsley-Hickman, P.B., and Frick T.D. This manual is available in the bookstore. You will need to bring it to each laboratory session including the first one.
  2. Lab coat
  3. Calculator - You will need a scientific calculator (one which will do logarithms and exponentials) for the first section of the lecture material and throughout the term in the laboratory.

It is expected that students will prepare for and attend all scheduled
lectures and laboratory sessions. An occasional absence may be inevitable due
to illness or other problem, however, excessive absences are not acceptable.
Your profession grants accreditation based on hours of instruction. Recorded
absences from more than 10 % of scheduled lecture and or laboratory sessions
will result in automatic failure of the course. If you are absent from a
laboratory meeting, it is your responsibility to make arrangements with the
instructor to make it up. No credit will be given for laboratory exercises
when you are absent.

There are a total of 1000 points which can be earned in the course. They will
be earned in:

| Exam 1 and Final | 2 x 150 | 300  
---|---|---  
Exam 2 and 3 | 2 x 175 | 350  
Ten weekly quizzes | ![](../graphics/pixel.gif)10 x 10 | 100  
Laboratory work |   | 250  
Total: | ![](../graphics/pixel.gif) | 1000  
  
The course is divided into four Units. Hour exams will be given following
completion of each Unit (see _Exam schedule_ ). I expect to run somewhat
behind schedule in the first two Units and catch up in Unit three. Exams will
cover the material we have covered in lecture or material that I have
explicitly told you to cover on your own. Exam questions will be approximately
70-80% multiple choice and 20-30% short answer or problems. There will be a
short quiz at the beginning of each Tuesday lecture. These quizzes will help
you to evaluate how well you comprehend the material and serve as study guides
for the exams. The Laboratory requirements will be discussed when you meet in
lab. The Final Exam will cover the topics discussed in Unit IV. This is
actually an inclusive exam since the topics will draw on the background which
you have developed throughout the semester to understand vitamins, sugar
metabolism and oxygen transport.

__Exam Schedule__  
Hour Exams are scheduled on Thursdays, 1:00-2:00. You should be able to finish
the exam in one hour, however, you may extend the time by coming in early and
using some of your lunch hour. The customary $30 fee will be charged for
unexcused make-up exams and I may elect to make these exams 100% essay
questions.  
  

  * **Exam 1** \- June 3, 2002 
  * **Exam 2** \- June 24, 2002 
  * **Exam 3** \- July 15, 2002 
  * **Final** \---- Finals Week 

Guaranteed grades are as follows:

A = | 900 \- 1000  
---|---  
B = | 800 \- 899  
C = | 700 \- 799  
D = | 600 \- 699  
F = |  <600

**Please Note**  
This schedule of lecture and lab topics and quizzes and exams may be changed
during the course of the trimester as circumstances require. Whenever
possible, such changes will be announced in class before the date and time in
question. You are responsible for anything that transpires during lectures and
labs, even when you are unable to attend. In the event that you miss a class
session, make sure you check with a classmate about any announcements or
schedule changes which may have been made. Makeup exams are allowed only
according to the policies described in the current student handbook, which is
available in the Student Affairs office.

Syllabus and Outline_

**A. _Purpose and Format of Course_**

This course is designed to examine the history of the international slave
trade from Africa by Arab traders (c. 950-1850) and European nations and
merchants (1450-1850). It will search for the international origins of the
African slave trade from the larger historical context of the changes in the
Old and New Worlds, including the strengthening of Western Europe and of
Tsarist Russia and the relative weaknesses of Africa. It will evaluate the
ideological and intellectual justifications of the slave trade in Islam,
Christianity and in secular Western scholarship. The course will also assess
the social, political, economic, and psychological impact of the slave trade
on Africa and Africans and trace the links between the slave trade and the
origins of European imperialism in Africa.  


**B. _Evaluation of Students' Performances and Basis of Grading_** :

Each graduate student enrolled in this course is required (i) to make a
written class presentation on an assigned topic and (ii) to complete a
substantial paper on a subject, chosen in consultation with the instructor, at
the end of the semester. In addition, some credit will be given for
participation in class discussions. Grades will be awarded on the basis of
students' performances in these assignments: Individual class presentation:
20%; participation in class discussions: 10%; and paper due at the end of
semester: 70%.

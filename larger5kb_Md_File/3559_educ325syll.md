**COURSE ACTIVITIES:**

  1. **Attend and participate in all classes. Complete extra assignments. Final grades will be reduced by 2% points for every cut class. Lateness will no noted and count towards cuts. Extra assignments not completed will be treated the same as cut classes. Absence for illness will be excused with written verification from a healing practitioner.**
  2. **Read and be prepared to discuss all reading assignments. This includes looking over activity cards and being ready to explain them to the class. The chapter on Problem Solving has many problems to solve. You need to do these. There will be a test on the first seven chapters of Reys.**
  3. **Keep a Math Journal: Each week you must have a minimum of three entries in your journal. Some prompts will be given in class. Other entries should focus on how you see math being used in daily life or where you see it displayed in nature. The purpose of the journal is to help you see the importance of math in your world. You may also use the journal to express your feelings about mathematical topics. Your journal is to be done via word processing. The use of graphics to showcase your computer skills is beneficial. You will be graded on the thought that goes into your entries and the presentation of the journal. Journal pages must be submitted for the previous week on each of the following Tuesdays: 1/18, 1/25, 2/1, 2/8, 2/15, 2/22, 2/29.**
  4. **Group Project: Plan, prepare, and present to the class the mathematics curriculum for a given grade level. The presentation must include a brief overview of the curriculum at the grade level, one hands-on whole group learning activity by each member of the group, and a learning center designed by each member. The activities and learning centers must all represent different parts of the curriculum. See rubric for further details. Due Date: As per schedule.**
  5. **Research paper: Summarize the NCTM Curriculum and Evaluation Standards. Discuss how this document will impact on you as a teacher. Cite a minimum of three references from articles about implementing the Standards in the classroom. You must use three different journals. You may use three different Teaching Children Mathematics journals. The internet and your textbook may be used as additional resources. Papers should be 5 to 10 pages in length (not counting the title page and the bibliography) and must be printed via word processing. Use a 12 point easy to read (not all caps) font, 1.5 line spacing, and 1" margins all around. 1/3 of your paper should be devoted to a summary of the NCTM Standards. 1/3 should discuss the research you found in magazines, and 1/3 should be your personal reactions to your own mathematics education and how you will implement the Standards in your own teaching. If you have any doubts about how to write a research paper, visit the Writing Center. As an elementary teacher you are expected to be a very proficient writer. You should be well versed in the rules of grammar and composition. This paper will be graded according to content and style. Due Date: February 3.**
  6. **Complete Pre-student Teaching Field Experience requirements. Notebook due April 25. A separate syllabus will be distributed in class prior to the beginning of the field experience.**
  7. **On your own, prepare for your final exam. This will cover the mathematics content of 8th grade. Sample 8th grade chapter tests are on reserve in the library, as well as an Addison-Wesley 8th grade Teacher's Edition. This is not an easy test. I suggest you start studying right away, and preferably with a buddy.**



**COURSE EVALUATION:**

**Your performance will be assessed in the following areas:**

**15% of final grade**  
  
**Journal**

|

**20% of final grade**  
  
**Group Curriculum Project**

|

**25% of final grade**  
  
**Junior Field Experience**

|

**15% of final grade**  
  
**Final Exam**

|

**15% of final grade**  
  
**

**Your performance in all areas will be graded in accordance with Moravian
College's standards of academic achievement. See page 38 of the Student
Handbook for a description of these standards. Fulfilling any given
requirement does not automatically guarantee an A for an assignment. A's are
given to those students who go beyond the requirements and expectations.
Assignments must show evidence of time, effort, originality, and dedication to
the research process.**

**The following grade conversions will be used in determining your recorded
letter grade for the course:**

**

**94 - 100 = A**

|

**74 - 76 = C**  
  
---|---  
  
**90 - 93 = A-**

|

**70 - 73 = C-**  
  
**87 - 89 = B+**

|

**67 - 69 = D+**  
  
**84 - 86 = B**

|

**64 - 66 = D**  
  
**80 - 83 = B-**

|

**60 - 63 = D-**  
  
**77 - 79 = C+**

|

**0 - 59 = F**  
  
**

**The Moravian College policy on academic honesty will be followed. See page
50 of the Student Handbook for a copy of this policy.**

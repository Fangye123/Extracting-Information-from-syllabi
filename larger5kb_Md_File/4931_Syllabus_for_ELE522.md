**C      COURSE REQUIREMENTS**  
(Each of the following requirements is described in detail in separate modules
on the home page of this course)

>  1\. **Releasing the course:** WebCT (Technology) Training with Dr. Nason is
not required before students can participate in this course but you need to
show proficiency in making and uploading web pages. ON-campus training is
Tuesday, May 28 2:00-5:00 pm or Tuesday, May 28 at 6:30-9:30 pm in the LINC of
SFA's library. There is a direct relationship between success in the course
and attendance at orientation.  Those who attend have a more positive attitude
about the course because it builds community. They are also better prepared to
take other web courses in the program. The course assignments **will not be
released to you** until you have:  
>           (a) completed the entry inventory which includes a course
[contract](contract.html) (click link to preview contract);  
>           (b) created and uploaded your own web page with your picture on it
(click link for instructions); and  
>           (c) completed the on-line learning inventories (link found on home
page of the course).

>

>  2\. **Attendance Policy:** ELE 520 meets in cyberspace.  Each student is
responsible for attending whole class web chats for discussions over the video
and group web chats as necessary to  accomplish your group's project.  This
course is interactive with some of the course work being done in a
collaborative manner with classmates over the internet.

>

>  3\. **Professionalism:**   Enthusiastic completion of the course activities
is of utmost importance in demonstrating commitment to becoming a responsible
teacher.  Mastery and professional products reflect quality work and reflect
on the work you will produce as a teacher.   Attitude and confidentiality are
essential in determining the teacher's potential as a successful educator.
Gossiping about other students is a reflection of negativism and lack of
maturity and integrity.  When problems occur, go to your university professor;
you will find that others' attitudes are easily influenced through negativity.
(One bad apple DOES spoil the whole bunch!!)

>

>  4\. **Technology Skills:   **OIT has criteria specifications for computer
hardware and software.  **** To be successful in this course you need to know
how to create web pages using Netscape Composer (you can download Netscape
Composer from [OIT](http://oit.sfasu.edu/soft/)  and then proceeding to "Web
Applications" tp download Netscape Communicator, 128-bit Encryption version,
Version: 4.76.  Instructions for creating web pages are in the course).  You
also need to be able to create your files in MS Word (Word can also be
downloaded from the OIT site), send and receive files in e-mail, to get
clipart from the web and put the clip art into word and html files, and to
type fast enough to contribute to chats.  It would also be helpful if you can
zip and unzip files. You should have Power Point and Acrobat Reader on your
computer (also available to download from the
[OIT](http://oit.sfasu.edu/soft/) site).

>

> 5.  **Classroom management rules:** Managing a classroom in cyberspace is
much like management of a well-run classroom.  Rules are as follows:

>

>> a. Late work will not be accepted without consequences (barring natural
disasters). Assignments that are up to 7 days late will receive a -10% from
the score; those that are more than 7 days late will receive a - 50% from the
score.  This is a rule because the order of course assignments builds as you
go along.  You need to receive feedback in order to learn and grow.  Analogy:
You do not start on a 5 day trip the day you are supposed to arrive \- you
will not get there in time. . .  
> b.  Unless otherwise designated, **all work will be turned in as a Microsoft
Word (.doc) document attached to WebCT mail message.   It will be titled as
follows: your last name[space]name-of-assignment (designated in assignment);
Ex.: Nason ch1-reflect.doc**  
> c.  Your name will be in the header of each assignment on every page (in
Microsoft Word, go to VIEW, then "header and footer").  
> d.  You will mail the assignments in WebCT to yourself as well as to your
instructor so that you know that I have received the assignment. A notice
saying that your assignment has been received will NOT be sent.  You will then
have a copy of what you sent and proof that it was sent by the due date.  If
the web is down at the designated time of the due date, wait to send the
assignment when it is back up (this does not mean midnight when it is due).
Unless these rules are followed, you will not receive credit for the
assignment.  
> e.  Send assignments only ONE time unless your professor indicates that you
need to send it again.  
> f. Access your mail EVERY day.  Messages to the whole class from your
instructor contain important information and instructions for which **you**
are responsible.  
>  g.  Email messages relating to questions that are addressed in messages
already sent by the professor will not be answered.  Specific questions will
be answered ASAP.  All messages from your instructor will have the subject
written in capitol letters.  These messages should be saved in a special
folder in your mail box for future reference.

>

> 6.  You need to print out or **save the assignments** on a disk (suggested
method) so that you can work on them if the web is down.   They will save as
html documents and you can open them in your browser (Netscape or Internet
Explorer)

>

> 7\. **Plagiarism is not allowed.  ** You must re-word everything that you
write so that it is in your own words.  Quotes and pictures from web sites
must be cited.  Copying from each other, the Internet, or any other resource
is considered cheating and will result in receiving a 0% for that assignment
and could lead to an F in the course and/or dismissal from the university.

>

> ***** 8. **All assignments must be completed in order to pass the course.**
Assignments will not be resubmitted for grading. Feedback will be given BEFORE
the due date if you desire and a scored rubric with comments will be emailed
to you when your assignments are graded.  **No with-holds for incomplete work
will be given.**

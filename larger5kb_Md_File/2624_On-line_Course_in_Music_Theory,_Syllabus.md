Hi! My name is Larry Solomon, and I will be your instructor in this class.
I'll try to make this a rewarding and interesting experience for you, and I
should be easy to contact via E-mail. Having worked with the Internet Web for
years, I am excited by its potentials. The Web makes it possible to self-pace
your study without leaving your home or workplace, and it has multi-media
capabilities.

## Class Meetings, Discussion Group, Communication & Attendance

Since this is an Internet course there are no required class meetings and no
attendance record. Students are expected to participate in the class
Discussion Group, or DG. The instructor will inform you as to when the DG is
ready to use near the beginning of the term . The DG messages go out to
everyone in the class. It is your opportunity to communicate with other
students in the class in a public way. You can ask questions, rap on topics,
and learn from one another. It is not to be used for topics outside of this
course. I suggest that you send a message at least once a week to the DG, even
if it's just a greeting. This is the only way to tell who is participating and
the only way to communicate with the class. You can also communicate privately
with the instructor or other students by E-mail.



* * *

## **Workload Expectations for Study**

Readings, tests, drills, discussions (Discussion Group).

Studying through an Internet course does not mean that less work or time is
involved. Actually, much more responsibility is placed upon the student in
this type of study. Self motivation is essential. It is recommended that
students should reserve **_at least_** an hour every day or seven hours per
week for a normal session (summer sessions will require twice that amount).
This assumes a most efficient use of time, and does not include test time or
travel time. All hours in one session once a week is a poor study schedule and
is not recommended. It is important not to miss any days since that will set
back memory.

* * *

## **Required Texts & Manuscript Paper**

The texts are available in the West Campus bookstore and are **inexpensive**.
Distance learners can order the texts from the bookstore by phone and a credit
card. They will mail them to you. Their phone number is (520) 206-6927.

## **Testing & Theory Tutor**![](Reading.gif)

Exams are taken in the West Campus **Testing** **Center (TC)** of Pima
College. It is located in the Santa Catalina Building (Library building), West
Campus. Their phone number is 206-6819. Please phone them for their current
hours, and be sure to get a copy of the TC rules on your first trip.

Distance learners or those who **_cannot_** come to the TC should read about
**[Remote Testing](remotest.htm)** arrangements. For any tests taken off the
West Campus it is the responsibility of the student to obtain permission from
the instructor and to assure that the tests are properly administered and sent
back to the instructor. Students should thereafter check to assure that the
instructor has received any tests taken. All tests must reach the instructor
by the last testing date posted.

Bring a picture ID to take a test. The testing rate is individualized so that
a student need not take an exam at the same time or day as other students. Be
sure that you take all the tests for Mus102 listed on the class Schedule and
that they reach the instructor by the final test date.

_Any test may be taken at any time or day that the TC is open, or retaken to
improve skills and grades. Only the highest score of each test will be
averaged into the final grade. **** The first test, or any other exam, may be
retaken even at the end of the semester, or at any time during the term, if a
student wishes to raise an exam grade. Test dates on the class Schedule are
only SUGGESTED dates for taking exams in a timely manner. _It is important,
although not required, to keep on schedule with your testing. WARNING! Do not
procrastinate!

**All tests must pass in order to pass the course**. **A failing grade on any
test that is not subsequently passed will result in failing the course.**
**The last day that an exam may be taken is the date posted on the**
[**Schedule & Assignments**.](Mu102sch.htm)

Test results are normally available within a few days of testing, and all
results will be kept by the instructor. You **must** phone the instructor to
ask for your exam grade/results and/or advice. Do not ask for test results by
E-mail unless you are an approved distance learner. (DLs may E-mail these
requests.) If someone else answers my telephone it is probably the Theory
Tutor, who can also give you your exam results and answer questions. The Tutor
is available (not during the summer, however) should you need additional help,
as long as you can arrange a mutually convenient meeting time or talk via
phone. Tests _will not_ be returned to you; nor will you be automatically
informed of results. If you want to look at your tests you must arrange to
visit the office by phone. You may examine your tests and ask questions, but
_**your tests must not leave the office**. _

Every student is to abide by the rules of the Testing Center and **_act
courteously_**. Discourteous behavior will be noted. All exams must be stamped
with the time before leaving. No materials other than a pencil will be taken
into the testing room. Each exam will be done only in this room and returned
promptly to the monitor, whether or not it is completed!! **Under no
circumstances is a test form to leave the testing area!**

**Students should check with the instructor or Tutor at least one week before
the last date of testing to be sure that all exams and grades have been
accounted for, and that none are missing. Any outstanding exams still to be
taken or retaken should be reported at that time with the date of intended
completion. Otherwise, the instructor's records are deemed complete and
correct. DO NOT ask for a semester grade. That should come to you officially
by mail from the Admissions Office at the proper time.**

* * *

## **Grades**

Students are expected to keep track of their own progress and grades to
satisfy obligations for the class. If necessary, it is up to each student to
contact the instructor periodically throughout the semester concerning grades
and class obligations. Don't expect the instructor to hound you about these
obligations.

As explained above, all tests can be retaken any number of times to improve
skills and grades. Only the highest grade on each will be averaged into the
final grade.

90-100% = A  
80-89%   = B  
70-79%   = C  
60-69%   = D  
below 60 = F

No incompletes or other grades will be issued.

The test grades will receive a letter grade based on the above scale, and an
average weighted grade will make up the final grade. (Each of the above test
letter grades will be adjusted to the middle percentage; e.g., B=85, etc.).
**All tests must be completed, and all must have passing grades in order to
pass the course.** No incompletes are given in this course.

Remember that you cannot pass the course if a test grade is missing.
Discussion Group participation _will affect grade determination_ when the
grade average is borderlined.

The following policies were adopted in July 1999 by the Board of Governors:
The "Y instructor withdrawal grade is no longer an option except in speial
cases that require documentation by the student and instructor. Any student
wishing a "Y" MUST consult with the instructor before the end of the semester.
Otherwise this grade will not be issued. A grade of C or better is required
for any general education class, such as Mus102, in order to count towards
graduation. D does not qualify.

* * *

## **Scholastic ethics**

Breaches in scholastic ethics, such as cheating on an exam, copying someone's
work (plagiarism), or stealing exams, etc., will result in failing the class
(grade=F).

* * *

## **Students with Diabilities**

Reasonable accomodations, including materials in an alternative format, will
be made for individuals with disabilities when a minimum of five working days
advance notice is given. Contact the West Campus Student Resource Office at
206-6688 for more information.

**Course description** :  
A survey of European art from the 14th through the early 19th century,
encompassing the Renaissance, Baroque and Neoclassical periods. Special
attention is given to masterpieces of these periods in the Art Institute of
Chicago. Though it is the middle course of a three-part sequence, the only
prerequisite is Eng. 102.

**Objectives** :

  1. To develop a working knowledge of the basic methodologies of the discipline of art history. While concentrating on masterpieces of Renaissance and Baroque painting and sculpture (and architecture, to a lesser extent) the alternative approaches of stylistic analysis and iconology will be explored.
  2. To practice a full array of research skills, from identification of problems worth pursuing, and formulation of hypotheses & strategies for collecting information, to the location and use of standard reference works, on-line resources and Interlibrary Loan.
  3. To improve one's command of the English language, particularly in writing discursive prose. Of the two writing assignments, one is a museum critique whose objective is to demonstrate conversance with Wolfflin's Principles of Art History, after his approach to stylistic analysis has been thoroughly discussed in class. 

The other is a multi-stage research project, incorporating a series of
separate assignments pertaining to selection of topic, bibliography annotation
and construction of your paper's basic argument. Due dates for both projects
are included in the attached assignment schedule.

**Text** : Fred S. Kleiner, Christin J. Mamiya and Richard G.Tansey, Gardner's
Art Through the Ages, vol. II 11th ed. (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich,
2001)

Also recommended ( & on reserve):  
Sylvan Barnet, A Short Guide to Writing about Art (5th., Boston: Little,
Brown, 1997); on permanent reserve

Heinrich Wolfflin, Principles of Art History: The Problem of the Development
of Style in Later Art, trans. M.D. Hottinger (1932, reprint N. Y: Dover) [on
reserve: Call# 709 W85P

Kenneth Clark, Civilisation: A Personal View (N.Y.: Harper and Row, l969)
[highly recommended, on video, available at many public libraries.]

**Reading Assignments** :  
One of the most important requirements for successful completion of this
course is keeping on schedule with the assigned readings. Ideally class
lectures will also keep pace with the attached schedule, but if they seem to
fall behind, you should at least read in advance of class those portions which
are likely to be covered.

**Tests** :  
Three tests, including the Final (not cumulative) have been scheduled. Each
will be balanced between a section of objective, short-answer questions, and a
series of 4 or 5 slide-illustrated essay questions. Periodically, a short quiz
may be used to review discussion of the previous day, or as a lecture preview
(so regular attendance is, of course, essential as these cannot be made up).

**The Museum Critique** :  
The primary purpose of this assignment is to practice first hand analysis of
actual works of art. Typically you should plan on visiting the Art Institute
at least twice during the course of the semester -- once to survey the
museum's overall holdings of Renaissance and Baroque art, and then a second
time for the purpose of conducting a comparative analysis of two specific
works. [If there's sufficient class interest we can make the first visit a
group field trip.] This comparison is intended to demonstrate conversance with
Heinrich Wolfflin's Principles of Art History: i.e., it should involve the
definition and application of his five sets of contrasting modes of
representation. [A Xerox copy of his introduction will be distributed and
discussed thoroughly in class.]

**The Research Paper** :

The major term paper need not be completed before December 3rd, but two
preliminary deadlines must also be met. First, by October 22nd, a tentative
proposal of your topic must be submitted. Keep it general at that time, yet in
approximately 200 words (less than 1 double-spaced page) try to connect it in
with other interest areas you may have. [Lots of viable topic suggestions will
be made in class, or can be discussed individually, and should be.] On a
computer disc keep updating a bibliography file, annotating the special value
of each book and article you see. Ideally, this preliminary submission, and
all subsequent drafts should be submitted electronically, via e-mail. If this
sounds like an unfamiliar process&emdash;don't worry--think of it as one of
the free extra skills you'll be taught during this semester.

Next, by November 19th, is due a more focused abstract of your work in
progress. The minimum number of sources to have found and used by that time --
15, including a variety of reference books, monographs, and journal articles,
many of which are now available in full-text on line. Still more may/should be
utilized thereafter, and all should be included in the final "select"
bibliography (also annotated), attached to your final paper.

Since the formal mechanics of your writing (in terms of clarity of conception,
organization, grammatical accuracy, and cleanliness of the final, computer
print out) are equal in importance to its content, please take advantage of
the peer-review services of the Learning Assistance Center, in L111. Also
recommended in perusal of Sylvan Barnet's Writing Guide, listed above. A copy
is on permanent reserve in the library, and there are others.

**Grading** :  
Each of the three tests and the two papers are weighted approximately the same
about 15% of the total grade, with the proviso that the two preliminary
research-progress reports will be worth 5% and 10% also. [Thus, as a composite
3 stage process the Resarch project is worth as much as two tests]. A final
10% is a more subjective component based on regularity of attendance, oral
participation and the occasional quiz results (the lowest of which will be
discarded). Late assignments may be penalized one-third of a letter grade, per
class session.

### INTRODUCTION

This early United States history course presents a conceptual framework that
differs significantly from what has been taught in college survey classes.
While the course was originally designed to be used in the teacher's education
program at California State University, Long Beach, it has now been adopted as
the standard course outline for all early U.S. history courses taught at this
university and has been successfully used at colleges and universities across
the nation. The first thing of significance is the amount of work that the
student and professor must do. For instance, the course uses two textbooks;
one standard U.S. History Textbook and the second, a textbook that I used as
the primary reader in my early American Indian History classroom. Students
will essentially be taking a combination of U. S. History and American Indian
History simultaneously. This solves the problem of American Indian people
disappearing after the American Revolution or perhaps the War of 1812.
Secondly, this course requires that students produce a portfolio that includes
all work done during the semester including final group projects of writing a
chapter for a history book. This assignment brings together the entirety of
the early United States experience including the Civil War and Reconstruction
eras. Thirdly, this courses uses as its course objectives selected standards
taken from the California standards for the teaching of United States history.

### COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course is designed to provide a survey of the political, social,
economic, and cultural development of the United States from pre-European
contact through reconstruction. Specific attention will be directed to the
colonial era, establishment of the new nation, sectional problems, national
growth, disunion and reconstruction. In keeping with the name of your text, we
will focus as often as possible on the history of the United States through
the lives of the people who created the new nation and the new society.
Particular attention will be placed on the interaction between Europeans,
Americans, and the Native Peoples of the "New World."

###  COURSE OBJECTIVES

(What you are expected to know upon completion of this course of instruction).
The following course objectives are broad statements that include a number of
subsets of knowledge to be gained.

  1. Upon completion of this course of study students will understand the major events preceding the founding of the nation and be able to relate their significance to the development of American constitutional democracy. 
  2. Students will understand the political principles underlying the U. S. Constitution and compare the enumerated and implied powers of the federal government.
  3. Students will be able to understand the foundation of the American political system and the ways in which citizens participate in it. 
  4. Students will analyze and understand U. S. foreign policy in the Early Republic 
  5. Students will understand the divergent paths of the American people from 1800 to the mid-1800s and the challenges they faced in the North, South, and West. 
  6. Students will analyze and identify the early and steady attempts to protect and to abolish slavery and realize the ideals of the Declaration of Independence. 
  7. Students will analyze and understand the causes, key events, and complex consequences of the Civil War. 
  8. Students will analyze and understand the character and lasting consequences of Reconstruction. 
  9. Students will understand that concepts such as race, class, gender, freedom, and rights are historical and cultural constructs that change over time. 
  10. Students will recognize and understand the concept of "agency." People of African descent, Mexican descent, American Indians, or women were not simply "acted upon," but exercised historical agency themselves by the choices they made and the actions they took individually or collectively. 
  11. Students will be able to identify, understand, and explore the connections between religious, social, economic, and political developments from the time of European contact in the New World through the Reconstruction Era.

Throughout the semester I will present historical documents, photographs, and
commentary through the use of Laser Disk, CD Rom, and other computer
technology. These rubrics are intended to supplement my lectures, your
assigned readings, and to enhance the learning experience through the use of
the latest classroom technology. While entertaining in-and-of themselves, it
should be understood that they are intended as educational and instructional
materials and contain testable materials.

### ASSIGNMENTS

The reading assignments for each week and class session are listed by date.
You are expected to have completed your readings prior to class and be
prepared to discuss or address specific issues raised in the readings. In
addition to the three scheduled essay exams each of which is worth 100 points,
each student will be requited to prepare a 10 page research paper addressing
some particular issue in early American history. The research paper will be
worth 100 points. Research papers must be typed or prepared on a word
processor and prepared in the "Turabian" style. For guidelines see _A Manual
for Writers_ , Kate L. Turabian, fifth edition, available in the bookstore or
the college library.

### GRADING RUBRIC

A [grading rubric](johnsongrading.html) is provided to guide and assist you in
understanding how I evaluate your essays.

### GROUP PROJECT

Each student will participate in the development of a group project that will
be due on the final day of class. Students will work together in groups of
four on this project. The group assignment is as follows: Your group is
assigned the responsibility of writing a chapter for a History Textbook titled
"The Cause of The Civil War." Choose one of the following thesis statements:
Slavery Caused the Civil War, Slavery Did Not Cause the Civil War, or Slavery
Was One of Several Causes of The Civil War. Using at least four sources
outside of your assigned reading write a double-spaced draft of a book chapter
that supports your thesis and includes analysis of the following factors. 1)
Religion 2) politics 3) sectionalism 4) economics 5) the U.S. constitution 6)
states' rights, and 7) individual rights and liberties. Each of these factors
has roots that reach back into the colonial era and a thoughtful analysis
should include such an evaluation. You may choose to include other factors
that I have not identified above. There is no page requirement or limit for
this project. You will be graded as a group and individuals who do not
participate will be marked accordingly. The group project is worth up to a
maximum of 100 points for each student and is due on the day of the final
exam.

### GRADING

  * First Midterm essay 100 pts A = 450 and above
  * Second Midterm essay 100 pts B = 400 to 449 
  * Final exam essay essay 100 pt C = 350 to 399 
  * Research Paper 100 pts D = 300 to 349 
  * Group Project 100 pts F = less than 300 Total Points 500 

Throughout the course students will be required to access my World Wide Web
Site (listed above) and to analyze and critique specific assigned areas as
they relate to the founding of the United States and its developing
governmental structure. Written, graded assignments will accompany the
analysis and critique. Grades assigned will be added to the above scores as
extra credit.

### ASSESSMENT

Assessment is the way in which the individual professor and the university
evaluate the effectiveness of a particular course of instruction. To do this a
basis must be established upon which to judge intellectual growth.
Accordingly, you will be given an ungraded essay exercise at the first class
meeting which will become part of a portfolio that each student will be
required to keep for the duration of the semester. Every graded exercise,
including the final research paper and group project will become part of this
portfolio. The portfolio will be turned in at the final exam and can be picked
up at the beginning of the spring 2000 semester. A penalty of twenty-five
points will be assessed for failure to turn in completed portfolios.

### MAKE-UP EXAM POLICY

In the event of a missed examination you may contact me for an alternate exam
date.

### WITHDRAWAL POLICY

The university policy on dropping and withdrawal from classes is set forth on
page 32 of the fall 99 schedule of classes. Students are obligated to
officially withdraw from their courses even though they have not attended.
Withdrawals require the signature of the instructor, the chairperson and the
dean of the college. Drops are not permitted without the Dean's signature
after November 19, 1999.

### CLASSROOM RULES

  1. You are expected to be present at every class meeting. This is a survey course and failure to attend class, as well as failure to prepare for class, will result in your missing a large amount of material. 
  2. Do not read material other than your assigned texts in the classroom. If you bring a newspaper or other material, please put it away at the beginning of class. 
  3. You may not listen to radios/CDs, etc, during class. 
  4. No beepers, pagers, or alarms are to be activated during the class session. 
  5. If you have a question or wish to make a comment on relevant material please do not hesitate to raise your hand. I do not mind being interrupted as your input and thoughts are an important part of the educational process. 
  6. Plagiarism is a serious offense when preparing research papers. Plagiarism is not allowed and is a violation of university regulations as well as our classroom rules. We will discuss this in class.

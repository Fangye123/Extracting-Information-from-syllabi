Course Description

_

The Senior Seminar is a one-hour course designed to prepare graduating History
majors for further studies or careers in the field.  Using a world history
text supplemented by an anthology of essays and primary sources, the course
reviews basic material from the department's undergraduate offerings while
encouraging students to reflect on themes in greater depth and view the
history curriculum as a whole.  This selection of topics is intended to
reflect both their emphasis within the discipline and the attention given to
these areas on the standardized exit exam for majors in the department.

Course Objectives

_

The goal of the Senior Seminar is to assure that graduating History majors are
equipped with the knowledge, skills, and dispositions necessary to become
informed and reflective historians.  Students completing HIST 499 should be
able to:

(1) identify the major periods of world history;  
(2) explain the significance of major historical developments and events;  
(3) analyze critically the idea of progress in history;  
(4) compare and contrast developments in different countries and regions;  
(5) distinguish between various fields or areas of emphasis in history; and  
(6) recognize the importance of argument and interpretation.

Seminar Participation

_

HIST 499 is a seminar rather than a lecture course, and the final grade is
based largely on class participation.  Although all students are responsible
for active participation in the seminar, one student will be designated as the
discussion leader for each topic.  The student leading the discussion should
prepare: (1) an oral presentation of about five to ten minutes in length, and
(2) a list of approximately ten questions for the other seminar participants
to consider.

_

Writing Assignments

_

All students are responsible for submitting a one-page commentary on the
assigned reading each week.  Students should not attempt to summarize the
reading (which would be difficult in any case) but should instead offer their
own response or reaction to the information or arguments presented.
Appropriate areas of emphasis include new insights or realizations, criticisms
of an author's approach, or questions arising from the text.

_

Academic Honesty

_

All students are expected to maintain ethical integrity.  Any instance of
cheating or plagiarism constitutes grounds for the assignment of an F in the
course, and such cases will normally be reported immediately to both the Vice
President for Academic Affairs and the Vice President for Student Affairs.

_

Attendance

_

Punctual attendance is required, and students arriving after roll is called
are considered absent.  Since the seminar only meets once a week, only **one
unexcused absence** is allowed.   Beyond this, unexcused absences will lower
the final grade. In the event of an emergency, please bring the appropriate
signed form from the Office of the Vice President for Student Affairs.

_

Grades

_

Final grades are determined according to student **preparation** for and
**participation** in the seminar.   The following formula roughly reflects the
weight assigned to each component of the course:

Class Participation  | 40%  
---|---  
Student Presentations  | 30%  
Writing Assignments | 30%

**About the Course:** This course deals with a vast subject--one of the great
movements in European history, imperialism, as it affected a great and complex
continent, much of whose history and society still await further scholarly
attention, Africa. This course focuses primarily on Africa south of the
Sahara, "Black Africa," in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the age of
the so-called New Imperialism. It considers the reasons for the New
Imperialism and the theories that seek to explain it. It examines the European
penetration of Africa, including the explorations preceding and accompanying
it, how it was accomplished, the African response, and European attitudes
toward Africa and the African. The course also examines the different types of
colonial administration, e.g., "indirect rule" versus "assimilation," and
differences in colonial policies, particularly the differences between the
French and British colonial models and policies. The effects of the European
presence in Africa cannot be appreciated without an understanding of
precolonial African society and politics, and consequently this background
will be examined for the areas selected for closer scrutiny. For the same
reason, consideration will also be given to the post- independence situation
of selected areas. The areas chosen for closer scrutiny are the Sudan, French
West Africa as a bloc versus British Nigeria, the Belgian Congo, Kenya, and
South Africa.

It is not expected that you will come into this course with a background in
African history. Reading is emphasized in this course. The objective of the
reading and lectures is to increase your understanding and to heighten your
interest in Africa and in this period of European expansion.

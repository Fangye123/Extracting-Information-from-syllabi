 **Course Objectives** : The Logical Basis of Computing is an introductory
course to computers that also provides a sound basis on which later studies in
computer science can be undertaken. At the end of the course, the student will
be able to:

  * Understand and practice problem-solving with the aim of developing computer applications.
  * Understand and practice the basic concepts of algorithms.
  * Develop computer programs and code them in the Pascal programming language.

**Course Description** : The Logical Basis of Computing studies through
lectures, examples, assignments and a project:

  * Introduction to computers and computing.
  * Structured programming, algorithms design.
  * Problem-solving methods for computer applications.
  * Pascal programming with data, decision, iteration, input/output, debugging.

**Grading** :

Midterm exam              20%

Final exam                    30%

Homework assignments 45%

Participation                   5%

 **Final exam** : The final exam will be comprehensive.

**Assignments** : The assignments are homework performed hands-on computers,
and **need to be done individually. _Copying of another student's program,
even if changes are subsequently made, is inappropriate, and such programs
_will not be accepted__**. Homework assignments are posted on my Web-site.
Completed assignments are to be placed in drop boxes located along the
**North** wall of Hebeler 218. The completed assignments must be turned in on
or before the due date specified on the assignment. Incomplete or non
functional assignments will be accepted. Late homework (turned in after the
due date) will not be accepted. Drop boxes are identified by the course and
lab number (CS105_02, etc.) and by the name of the TA grader for your lab **_.
Be sure to put your assignment in the correct box for your lab_**.

Mailbox slots with student names are located along the **West** wall in the
same room. Returned assignments will be placed in these boxes.

 **Participation** : Participation is based upon attendance and participation
in classroom work. Students are expected to attend lectures and labs. If you
are unable to attend class for any reason you should arrange to get class
notes from another member of the class, in addition to class slides posted on
the Web-site. Missing class is not an excuse for late homework or missed
exams.

**Make-up Tests and Late Homework Policy** : Allowing for late homework and
for making up missed exams is at the discretion of the instructor and is
generally only permitted when the cause for the late homework or missed exam
is outside the control of the student. It is the student's responsibility to
timely inform the instructor of reasons for missing an exam or homework
deadline and failure to do so may result in losing credit for the homework or
exam. Except in emergency situations, make-up tests are not allowed unless the
student has been excused by the instructor PRIOR to the examination.

 **General Considerations** : If you are having difficulty with the course or
with an assignment, see your instructor or TA for help. It is important in
this course to begin an assignment when it is first given out and to bring
problems to the attention of the instructor in class or in personal visits.

**Course changes** : The schedule and procedures for this course are subject
to change. Changes will be announced in class and it is the student's
responsibility to learn and adjust to changes.

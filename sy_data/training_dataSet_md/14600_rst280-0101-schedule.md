                                               **RST 280 Semester Schedule, Fall 2000**

        This schedule is based upon an "as-needed" concept of learning which allows for flexibility and student input   
        for the course.  Thus,   the schedule will be developed in sections or modules as the study progresses in order   
        to best meet the needs of the learners, the learning process and to allow the professor to mentor the learners   
        in the most significant directions and ways of learning.  This method of learning is, therefore, l **earner or student-**   
**         centered, active, experiential, collaborative,  interactive,
creative and critically** **reflective/contemplative,**  
**         and downright enjoyable**. This schedule is organic and alive with
possibilities. Assignments will be found listed here.

Course Description

    Programming Design and Software Tools is an undergraduate course covering the design of software and its implementation in the C programming language. The course involves minimal formal reading and maximal coding. The course lectures require that students have carefully read the assigned materials and have implemented the related code prior to the class meeting for which it is assigned. 

    The course is designed to operate in a didactic mode at the start, but to shift to problem based exploration later in the term. With each meeting, it is assumed that students will be increasingly focused on solving problems and will use class as a place in which some of the questions and issues they are facing may be addressed. 

    This course assumes that students understand programming in a scientific programming language but have not programmed in C. Students with limited programming experience or minimal experience with data structures may take the course, but should anticipate spending significant additional time to complete the first two projects. 

Course Goals

  * learn how to document a program
  * explore methods of program design
  * learn a bit about the management of programming projects
  * examine the proper use of functions
  * create libraries of functions
  * examine the use of programming utilities and tools
  * explore various system libraries of functions
  * explore the C programming language.

Course Policies

  * All work must be the student's own, unless collaboration is specifically and explicitly permitted. Any unauthorized collaboration or copying will **at minimum** result in no credit for the affected assignment and almost certainly be subject to further action under the **Guidelines on Academic Integrity** of SLIS and the University of Pittsburgh. A document discussing these guidelines was included in your orientation materials, and you should acquaint yourself with them.
  * You must be able to explain to my satisfaction at any time I choose all code you submit. This means every equals sign, every comma and every newline. **Failure to be able to explain your code to my satisfaction will result in immediate failure of the course.**
  * Late assignments will not be accepted, unless specific arrangements have been made with the instructor at least 3 days before the due date.
  * I reserve the right to modify the course requirements by administering surprise quizzes for up to 10 points or announced exams for up to 50 points if I feel that students are not pursuing a reasonable amount of course related reading and coding. Should this option be exercised, the point distribution for grades will be changed accordingly.
  * To give you an sense of what to expect, imagine that every point awarded for an assignment equates to 0.25 - 1.5 hours of coding per point. If you are a good (not great, just good) you could finish assignment 1 and do a great job in 7.5 hours (I really think it will take less than 3). If you are having difficulties with C, UNIX and reading the textbook, 25 hours may be required to finish the assignment.
  * The easiest means of contacting me is by electronic mail ([kabara@tele.pitt.edu)](mailto:kabara@tele.pitt.edu). This helps me organize my time, and ensures a more accurate and efficient response outside of office hours. I read my electronic mail throughout the day almost every day and will usually respond with an answer within a few hours of reading it, and almost always the same day. If the nature of your question requires an interactive session, please come to my office during office hours as scheduled.

Final Project  
  
* * *

  
Assignment Details:  
**(1)** Take the stats program discussed in class and combine it with the bar
graph program so that: the low end of the bar graph is the mean - the standard
deviate, the high end of the bar graph is the man plus the standard deviation
and the mean is marked in the middle. Compile the program and run it on the
data 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. Calculate the mean and standard deviation by hand to
show that the program computes the values correctly. Check you code to be
certain that you have removed any extraneous variables. The rule is that if
you calculate it and printf it don't store it, but if you use it in another
printf store it in a variable. Remove any unnecessary calculations from your
program. Submit your code by email to: TBA. Scoring will be discussed in
class.

**(2)** Modify the program written for assignment #1 so that: data is
collected in function main(), statistics are calculated in function stats()
and the bar graph is drawn by function bar_graph().  The  functions stats()
and bar_graph() must be in serparate source file and be compiled into their
own library file, which is then linked in. Function prototypes and any
#defines should go in a header file (*.h) that is #include in your main
program file. Write a makefile to compile your program and to create both
static and dynamic library files. The program must allow data to be entered on
the command line, or interactively by the user. The user should have the
option to output their choice of: mean, mean & std_dev, mean, std_dev & bar
graph, mean, variance, max data value, min data value, number of data points
and bar graph.

**(3)** Modify the program written for assignment #3 so that data is collected
from entries in a file whose   filename is entered on the command line and
output to a matching file name in either a default directory or in a directory
named on the command line. Functions for processing the command line, creating
new file names, reading data into the program and writing output should all be
separate.

**(4)** Modify the program written for assignment #3 so that the stored data
points are scaled by the scale factor(s) stored in the file header (we will
discuss this in class). This means you need to create data structures for the
header information and extract the pertinent values. Also add in a moving
average function and write the moving average to another data file. This
requires loading the entire data file into memory at once (at least that is
the most practical implementation). So you need to do memory allocation. Avoid
using global variables and pass arrays of data by reference.  


**Final Project:**  
    The final project is worth up to 50 points, half of your grade. It should be a significant indications of your ability to design and implement a program based in the C language. It may reasonably be an extension of the 4th project, or students may define any significant programming project they wish, so long as they clear it in advance with the instructor. We will discuss project ideas throughout the semester and rules of thumb for making is a good project. 

**Optional Activities**  
Students choosing this option must clear their topic with the instructor.
Write-up and present a 20 minute overview or build a web page based on some
material pertinent to programming in the C language:

  * make files and imakefiles
  * the ins and outs of ioctl
  * file locks
  * use of specialized libraries (string processing, graphics, numerical methods, distributed systems)
  * use of specialized programming tools (GUI tools, Visual C++, workshop, matlab numerical tools)
  * cross-platform development issues (cross compiling and testing code, say on a Palm III)
  * portability issues (compiler independence, library location independence)
  * code / project management tools (i.e. RCS or SCCS)
  * numerical methods (floating point / integer overflow or underflow)

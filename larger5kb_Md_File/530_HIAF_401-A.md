### Course Description

Conservationists currently lament Africa's degrading savannas and forests and
its loss of biodiversity. But their concerns actually stem from much older
efforts to exploit and to control African people and resources. This
colloquium explores the historical roots of conservation in Africa. We will
begin by exploring various ways of thinking about people-environment
relations. We will investigate the development of tourism, botanical gardens,
and tropical medicine as the means by which Europeans established themselves
as "experts" on African environmental problems. We will then examine struggles
between European colonial administrators, foresters and missionaries, and
African farmers, hunters and workers over forests, big game, and farming land.
Finally, we assess contemporary conservation debates, focusing the moral and
ethnical dilemmas of ecotourism, the making of "indigenous" peoples, parks and
buffer zones, and the ban on (and subsequent lifting of) the ivory trade. The
course culminates in a roundtable discussion, in which students represent
participants in a major conservation project in equatorial Africa.

For students who have no background in twentieth century African history, I
will provide some background in short lectures, distribute outlines, and make
available some basic texts.

### Course Requirements

**

Participation** _

The seminar meets once each week for two and a half hours. Your participation
will be crucial to the success of this seminar. Since I believe that students
learn best by teaching one another, I plan to do very little lecturing;
instead, you must prepare yourselves to participate and to contribute actively
to seminar discussions. Periodically, I will ask you to prepare a small
statement or exercise for class.

All students must pass a map quiz before the end of the course.

### Readings

**

Reading Materials**

All of the readings will be on reserve at the Clemons Library. If you are
unable to locate a particular reading, make sure you have looked it up under
the author and title of the article (if relevant) _as well as_ the author and
title of the edited volume in which the article was published. Course packets
containing most, but not all course readings are available at Brillig Books, 5
Elliewood Avenue, 296-9669.

Books on the syllabus which are marked with an asterisk (*) will be available
at the bookstore.

### Presentations

 **

Presentations** _

Each week, two students will be responsible for organizing and running the
class discussion. This activity will involve developing a series of open-ended
questions that will produce a lively discussion. You may organize the class
however you wish; debates, roundtable discussions, role playing, and small
group discussions are all acceptable forms of encouraging class discussion.
Each student will have an opportunity to run two class discussions. **

Guidelines for running an effective discussion:** _

  * 1\. Identify the central questions and contributions of the weekly readings, and develop a set of questions which address the following issues:   
What are the central arguments of this work?  
How does this work differ from other approaches to family history that we have
encountered in this course so far? How does the work change your
understandings of family in African history?  
What assumptions does the author hold?  
What methods does s/he use?  
What kinds of evidence?  
Can you find any difficulties with the assumptions, methods, or evidence, and
what bearing might these difficulties have on the author's central arguments?

  * 2\. Ask open-ended questions. Remember that your questions should _start_ , not end discussions. 
  * 3\. Be patient with silences. Sometimes it takes people awhile to figure out what they want to say. Try counting to twenty after you ask a question; most of the time, someone will respond before you reach twenty. 
  * 4\. Try not to dominate the conversation. 

* * *

**

Term paper** _

All students will be responsible for writing a twenty (20) page typed, double-
spaced research paper. You may choose a topic addressing conservation or land
use in Africa, though you may work on a comparative topic as well.

All students should turn in a proposal with an annotated bibliography for this
paper by September 24th. The proposal should identify the central questions
that you wish to investigate in the paper. It should also contain a
preliminary annotated bibliography, in which you provide a brief summary of
some of the works you will use in this paper. First drafts are due on October
29th. Final drafts are due on December 3rd. I will grade the annotated
bibliography, first draft, and final draft of the paper.

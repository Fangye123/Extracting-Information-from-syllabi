## Course Description:

This course explores some of the methodological issues raised by the prospect
of one culture understanding and making judgments about another. In
particular, we shall read and discuss essays on ethical and cognitive
relativism, incommensurability, and hermeneutics of suspicion and faith.
Although this course is primarily methodological, recent Western approaches to
understanding Chinese philosophy will provide test cases for some of the
theories we examine. Requirements include regular class participation that
shows familiarity with the readings and many brief essays.

## Advice

It is _impossible_ to understand philosophy (Eastern or Western) after one
reading. Even professional philosophers must read a philosophical text at
least twice in order to understand it. So _make sure to read every assignment
in this course at least twice_!

I do _not_ recommend reading additional outside sources on the topics covered
in this course. (Many secondary books and translations are very unreliable.)
Just read, re-read, and re-re-read the assignments. You are encouraged to
discuss the readings, lectures and paper topics with other students and with
the instructor. However, you must write up your papers by yourself. In
addition, _if you use any quotations, phrases or even ideas in your papers
that you did not come up with on your own, you must acknowledge this fact in a
citation. Failure to do so is plagiarism (a serious offense)_. It does not
make any difference whether the source is a book, encyclopedia article, oral
conversation, web site or anything else. Cite it!

My office hours are _your time_! Make use of them! In lecture, you are one of
several dozen students. In my office hours, you usually get one on one
attention. Take advantage of this opportunity!

Academic accommodations are available for students with documented
disabilities. Please schedule an appointment with the instructor early in the
semester to discuss any accommodation that may be needed for the course. All
accommodations must be approved through the Office of Disability and Support
Services (ext. 7584) as indicated in their accommodation letter.

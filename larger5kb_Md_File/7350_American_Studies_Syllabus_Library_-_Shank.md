THEORIZING AMERICA [Barry Shank](mailto:barrys@KUHUB.CC.UKANS.EDU) (University
of Kansas) ![](../dot.gif)

This course is an intensive reading seminar, intended to provide an
introduction to the theoretical debates regarding the study of culture that
have taken place in the last twenty years. We will use the seminar format to
mutually challenge, support and encourage each other in our struggles to read,
think, speak, and write about these positions. You will be required to read
and think about a significant bulk of material (150-200 pp.) each class
meeting. As part of that requirement, you will turn in a brief 2-4 page
response to each class's readings by 5:00 pm the Tuesday before we discuss
that reading. You will also be expected to take an active role in the class
discussion. The final will be in the form of a take-home exam that will
require you to synthesize and use the material of the course.

**Grading:** 50% weekly papers and class participation; 50% final

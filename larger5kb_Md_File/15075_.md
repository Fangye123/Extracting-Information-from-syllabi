**American Legal History**

"If you know your history,  
Then you would know where you coming from."  
\- Bob Marley, _Buffalo Soldier_

**Course Objectives** This survey course will introduce some main themes of
American legal history. The course materials run from the colonial period to
the 1970s, although the nineteenth century will receive particular emphasis.
The reading assignments indicate the topics that this course will cover. They
include colonial law and society; the American Revolution; constitutionalism;
Abraham Lincoln and American law; the legal profession; women and family;
Texas legal history; nineteenth-century criminal justice; antebellum slavery
and the coming of the civil war; secession; reconstruction; late-nineteenth-
century industrialism; legal education; formalism and legal realism; the New
Deal; and civil rights.

**Readings** The two books for this course are Kermit L. Hall, The Magic
Mirror: Law in American History (1989)("MM") and Kermit L. Hall, William M.
Wiecek, and Paul Finkelman, American Legal History: Cases and Materials (2d
ed. 1996) ("ALH"). Supplemental readings are listed in the syllabus.

**Office Hours** My official office hours are Tuesday and Thursday, 2:30-4:30.
For any other time, you are welcome either to drop by anytime I'm in my office
or to make appointments to see me. If you send an e-mail that requires a
detailed answer, leave a phone number where I can reach you.

**Attendance** School policy allows but five absences in this course; a sixth
absence results in you being dropped for excessive absences and receiving a
"WF." I will take roll at the beginning of class, using the seating chart. If
you aren't in your assigned seat when I take roll, you will be counted absent.
If you miss a class, you are responsible for any material and announcements
covered during that class. Please note that readings and assignments are
subject to change; you are responsible for changes in the syllabus.

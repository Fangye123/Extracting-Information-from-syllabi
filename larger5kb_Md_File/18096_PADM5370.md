**OBJECTIVE** : The objective of this course is to help you to understand the
role played by public officials, private citizens and the business community
in the formulation and implementation of environmental policy.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION** : This course will consist of a study of the political
factors that influence the environmental policy of the United States. Emphasis
is on the policy process rather than the details of environmental regulations.
In addition, we will focus on trash to illustrate this process. This will
allow us to use guest speakers from our community and field trips help
understand the policy process. Some of the specific issues we will examine
will include solid waste management, recycling, beach debris, storm water
drainage, and litter.

depth analysis of the local environmental policy issues we discuss. Course
requirements for graduate students that will not be required of undergraduates
include:

  * Graduate students will lead team projects to create World Wide Web sites on local environmental issues. The graduate students will be responsible for the overall design and content of the site. They will use inputs from the entire team for the content of specific pages. 
  * Graduate students will make written and oral reports of articles in the Cahn and O'Brien reader. 
  * Graduate students will arrange for field trips and guest speakers in order for the class to gather first-hand information on local environmental problems.

with me or with your classmates. You can also submit assignments by using
E-mail. You can [establish an

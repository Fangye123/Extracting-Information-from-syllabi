HISTORY OF SCIENCE:  ORIGINS TO NEWTON

* * *

Dr Robert A. Hatch - 226 Keene-Flint Hall - 392-0271  
HIS 3463 (5353X) - Spring 2002  
MWF 8 (3.00-3.50) - 119 Keene-Flint Hall  

* * *

In this course we survey changes and developments in Western science (natural
philosophy) from earliest times through the Scientific Revolution of the 17th
century. Lectures, discussions, and readings are concerned with the origin(s),
transmission, and development of scientific and philosophical ideas, and the
emergence of new intellectual, cultural, and linguistic communities and
practices. Particular emphasis is given to changing views and conceptions of
the traditional triad: 'Science, Nature, Man.' There will be a One Hour In-
Class Essay Exam in addition to a Take-Home Last Essay. Please note that
attendance is mandatory; participation is expected. Students may chose to
write an extra-credit Optional Research Essay; please see the _Study Guide_
and elsewhere at this WebSite for details. Office hours for Professor Hatch
are Wednesday, 4.00-7.00pm, and by appointment, 226 Keene-Flint Hall. Students
are strongly encouraged to take full advantage of Office Hours for
consultation and discussion. Telephone: 392.0271 (24h machine); E-Mail:

Evaluation  
  
All required work is announced on this syllabus. Attendance is mandatory and
all course requirements must be completed to receive class credit. Please note
that this is a demanding course. It involves substantial reading and writing,
and hence, careful preparation and planning are critical. Because a schedule
is provided in advance, absences and arrangements for late work **must** be
approved in advance. Please plan your course schedule and semester study
commitments with care. A basic rule of the course: When in doubt: Consult the
syllabus; ask questions; read ahead. Finally, students are expected to read
and understand a number of items (concerning examinations, writing papers,
secondary readings, etc.) available at my posted WebSite.   This WebSite
contains useful items (bibliography, WebLinks, Search Engines, etc.) as well
as practical guides on writing Blue Book Exams, University level essays, and
guidelines Reading & Writing & Studying.  Students are responsible for reading
this material early in the semester. Again, it is highly recommended that
students 'Bookmark' this page and consult the material regularly:
<http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages>  

* * *

Evaluation of course requirements takes five forms:

1\. Attendance is mandatory; completion of corrolated readings (prior to the
lecture) and comprehension of lecture material is required. Please note that
the _Study Guide_ is self-paced; students are expected to follow the topic
content and study materials appropriate to the lectures and the required
readings. All requirements must be met to complete the course and receive
class credit.  
2\. Participation in class discussion and activities is expected; there may be
unannounced quizzes and attendance may be monitored {Approximately 20%}  
3\. **Mid-Term Exam** : Wednesday, 20 February (30%). Written in-class 'Blue-
Book' Essay Exam. Please see the WebSite for guidelines and suggestions in
preparing for this exam. [How to take a Blue-Book
Exam](http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages/02-TeachingResources/readingwriting/05bl-
bk.htm).  
4\. **Take-home Essay** : **Nota Bene** : Due 12.00 Noon, Monday, 29 April in
Main History Department Office (025 Keene-Flint Hall). The Take-Home Essay (c.
50%) is a written take-home essay limited to 1000 words, the equivalent of
five {5} typed pages, double spaced, typed {No Binders Please: Kindly Staple
Securely}. Please see the WebSite for suggestions in preparing and writing
this essay. Students should retain a photocopy of their work for backup
purposes. If you wish to have your essay returned, kindly supply a large
manilla envelope (9x12) with the appropriate postage and address, and I will
return your essay and final course grade by post. Essays will not otherwise be
retained or returned.  
5\. **Optional Term Papers** : 15-page research essay; due no later than 12.00
Noon, Friday, Week XIV. The optional paper provides extra credit and can add
as much as one letter to the final course grade. The paper is non compulsory;
no one is penalized for not choosing this option. The Optional Term Paper
allows interested students to pursue a course topic in greater detail or to
identify an area not treated in this general survey course. As a practical
matter, students should consider carefully if they have sufficient time to do
a proper job. The Optional Paper should represent a solid and rewarding
effort. It is possible that time would be better directed to the required
readings. Required reading increases in quantity, subtlety, and significance
as the course concludes. In all cases, the topic for the Optional Term Paper
must be approved by the instructor. Please consult the Study Guide and
this[WebSite](http://web.clas.ufl.edu/users/rhatch/pages/02-TeachingResources/readingwriting/05optnal-
ess.htm) for further details regarding topic selection, approval, submission
dates, bibliography, and suggestions about research and writing. As always,
students should take advantage of Office Hours for discussion and
consultation.

Role of Engineering, Hazard & Risk Assessments, Codes, Zoning, Regulations,
Law & Enforcement. Infrastructure & Essential Facilities. Mega-Projects: Dams,
Irrigation, Transportation, Energy, Communication. Centralized vs. Diversified
Systems. Redundancy. Resiliency, Sustainability. Systemic Social
Vulnerabilities. Regional Examples: US, Japan, Central America, Venezuela,
Bangladesh, Afghanistan. Famines - Past vs. Present: Distribution Failure.
Examples: Iceland, Sahel. The Time Line of Disaster Effects. Speed of
Recovery. Political Fall-Out.

Solutions (i.e. Avoid "Disasters by Design", [see Mileti 1999]).  Distributing
Risk. Building of Inherent Resilience. Pre- vs. Post-Event Intervention:
Mitigation vs. Disaster Relief and Recovery Assistance. Local, Community-based
vs. Externally Imposed Measures (National and International). Equity Issues.

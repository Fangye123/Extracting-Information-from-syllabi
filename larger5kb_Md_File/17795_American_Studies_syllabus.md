**American Studies  
Course Syllabus - Mr. Timm**

**American Studies has two interrelated components. First, we will study the
history and literature (and by extension, the art and music) of the United
States. The course is designed around themes appropriate for the time period
we are studying. Each unit will have a series of essential questions that will
create focus in both the history and literature components.**

**The second emphasis for the course will be communication - both oral and
written. We will use the paragraph as our major unit of composition. Once we
have mastered a good paragraph, we will move to three and five paragraph
persuasive essays. Your writing this year will compliment and build on that
which you completed as ninth graders. As a part of each unit, vocabulary from
the literature and grammar from our own writing will be addressed.**

**Participation in class is vital to your success in American Studies.
Participation will take three forms: daily discussion, prepared presentations,
and literature seminars. Daily discussion means asking questions, responding
to ideas in class, and expressing your opinion. Presentations and debates will
be assigned and will provide the opportunity for you to prepare your remarks.
Seminar is an organized discussion around a piece of literature that will
require that you have some "key passages" from the reading to support your
ideas. We will learn together how to prepare for each of these facets of
participation.**

**Grading: You will be assessed in a variety of ways (in both history and
literature), from daily homework to major tests, formal essays, debates,
dramatic performance, and class participation. All work is weighted
proportionately to its importance or significance and /or the work and effort
it requires of you. For example, homework may receive a weight of 1 while a
test or formal essay may receive a weight of 5 or higher. All work that is
turned in on time may be revised and submitted for an improved grade.
Assignments turned in late receive reduced credit. You have my email address
and my home phone number--you can contact me at any time before 10:30 p.m. 7
days a week with questions about your work. You have no excuse for not having
your work completed on time. If you display a pattern of missing assignments
and/or turning in late assignments, we will re-evaluate your commitment to the
course to see if a lesser challenge would be more educationally appropriate
for you.**

**_Behavior:_ RESPECT, RESPONSE, RESPONSIBILITY are the three rules that set
the tone in our community of learners. We will respect ourselves, each other,
and the facility; we will respond thoughtfully (not react without thinking) to
each other, and we will accept responsibility for our own actions.  
  
_Extra Help:_ I am at school by 7:15 most mornings, and stay until at least
3:30 most afternoons. I can come in earlier or stay later to work with you.
You can reach me at home most evenings at 224-1763 until 10:30 p.m. or you can
email me at [mtimm1@aya.yale.edu](mailto:mtimm1@aya.yale.edu). There is really
no reason you cannot complete your assignments on time.  
  
_Parent Communication:_ Parents may contact me by telephone at school
(746-4167), at home (224-1763) or at my email address
[mtimm1@aya.yale.edu](mailto:mtimm1@aya.yale.edu); I am pleased to speak to
you at any time. If you would like a conference with me to discuss something
about your student's participation in this class, please do not hesitate to
call or email me.**

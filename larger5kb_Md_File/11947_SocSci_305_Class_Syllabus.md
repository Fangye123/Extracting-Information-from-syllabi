**_Course_** ** _Description:_**

The idea, applications, and experiences of genocide in history raise basic
questions for us all, especially those in minority communities threatened
(past or present) by severe prejudice, discrimination, persecution or even
annihilation. These questions arouse a variety of intellectual, emotional, and
ethical responses. By studying the Holocaust and other genocides, we deepen
our understanding of human nature, of organized society, political leadership,
democratic participation, and civilization itself.

The Holocaust Lectures explore the dynamics of history's best-documented
example of a systematic, deliberate brutalization and annihilation of one
human group by another. Thus, German Nazis and European Jews serve as the
central focus of this inquiry. From this central focal point, the lectures and
discussions branch out into related conceptual and empirical areas showing how
prejudice can escalate into genocide.

This year's theme reflects the organizers' concern for employing intellectual
knowledge based on facts, evidence, critical thinking and emotional awareness
in the service of effective ethical action to prevent genocide.

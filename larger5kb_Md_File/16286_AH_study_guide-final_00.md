**__Please note:_ I will be in my office (SOC 250) during my regular office
hours on Tuesday, April 23 (12:30-1:15 and probably later as well), but not on
Thursday, April 25; I have also added office hours for student questions on
Monday, April 29 in the morning (approx. 10 am-approx. 1 pm )   .  _EXAM #3 is

**Section I: Map Exercise**  
The instructions for this part of the exam will read as follows: _Identify
correctly the 10 places marked on the map (dots represent cities or sites;
cross-hatching represents regions, seas and islands).   Choose names from the
following list, and write your identification in the appropriately numbered
space on the map page (not on the map itself)._

The list on the exam will be selected from the entries below. Be sure that you
can locate the following places on your map.  Click on these links for
practice maps (use maps in texts or the map handed out in our class on Alex.
to locate Near Eastern sites): ([Greece & Asia Minor](grkmap001.jpg);

Section III: Essays  
Section III will be a selection of essays. You will be expected to refer to
**periods & dates**, use **terms** appropriate to the civilization and/or
period you are discussing (see below), and provide **specific names or
examples** (such as names of rulers, sites, monuments, or written evidence) to
support your discussion.  

***** Suggested topics of study for Section III (essays):*****

 ** _Note: The topics listed below are intended as a _guideline_ only.   They
are provided in order to suggest the areas on which to focus your study for
the essays.  Essay questions will be __adapted_ _from these topics. Some of
the topic areas below are extensive and/or overlapping as they will prepare
you for a number of possible questions. Remember to think about including
specific examples (including ancient sources of information), and be prepared
to provide relevant dates (discussed under "Study Tips" below)._**

  * Development of the polis in the Archaic Age. Consider the different forms of government that emerged, the concept of citizen rights and social status, and contributing economic developments (e.g., colonization).
  * The development of Athenian democracy under Solon, Cleisthenes and Pericles.  What was the role of the citizen?  What were the "institutions" of government by the time of the 5th century? What happened to the Athenian political system after the Peloponnesian War? 

  * Consider the political and social system of Sparta.  How did it compare to that of 5th century Athens?
  * The Persian Wars: Consider the major events, the causes, the protagonists and their backgrounds (including the Persian Empire), and sources of information.
  * What was the Athenian Empire? What was the "Golden Age of Athens"?  What led to its rise and fall? (This topic should include cultural as well as political characteristics).
  * The Peloponnesian War: Consider the parties involved, causes, policies and strategies, main events, results, sources of information. 
  * Discuss Greek religion (beliefs, ceremonies & festivals, types of offerings, settings).
  * What was the role of the Macedonians in the history of ancient Greece?  (Remember Hellenistic "successor kings" are a factor here too).
  * The character and career of Alexander the Great and the results of his conquests.

  
**Study tips:**

**Dates: *** _SEE YOUR CHRONOLOGY SHEET!!!_ *** 1) **Know the **centuries**
involved for the Dark Age, Archaic Period, Classical Period (primarily 5th
cent.), the rise of Macedonia/Philip (mid-4th century), and the Hellenistic
Age; 2) be able to give an **approximate date** (or portion of a century) for
the reforms of Cleisthenes (500 BC is good here), the Athenian Empire,  and
the Peloponnesian War; 3) know **exact year dates** for the two phases of the
Persian Wars (and the main battles involved) and the death of Alexander the
Great.   The dates for the Persian Wars and Alexander will provide you with
good "anchor" dates that can help you to remember the time periods of events
that happened before and after them.

BE  AWARE OF THE MAJOR WRITTEN SOURCES---consider the ways in which the
written evidence you have read (in Bailkey) contributes to the terms and
topics listed--be able to refer to some key sources in your discussions, when
appropriate.  Note: concentrate on literature/documents that were also pointed
out in class.

LOOK AT ILLUSTRATIONS IN THE TEXTBOOKS AND CLASS HANDOUTS. They are sometimes
sources of examples to support your discussion. LOOK AT MAPS IN TEXTS and
class handouts. Get your bearings!!

Vocabulary terms for use in the exam:  
You are not directly responsible for knowing these terms, but you should
familiarize yourself with them so that you can use them in your discussions in
Section III. You may also find them referred to in Section II. **Terms for

_Sociology is the study of society.   It focuses on identifying, explaining,
and interpreting patterns and processes of human social relations.  This
introductory course is designed not just to teach you some of the major
findings of sociology, but to help you master fundamental sociological skills,
including both the ability to think with a "sociological imagination" and to
master the basics of computer-based data analysis--skills which have broad
applicability in a range of educational and work settings.  It is my hope that
this hands-on experience of "doing" sociology will both enliven your interest
in sociological analysis and help you develop practical skills that you can
use in other contexts as well._

covered in class, including powerpoint-assisted lectures, films, video clips,
and computer-projected exercises in data analysis.

**Exams** |  There will be three closed-book, multiple-choice exams in this

**MicroCase  
Exercises** |  You will be asked to complete five computer-based assignments
from the _Discovering Sociology_ workbook, using the _Microcase Explorit_ data
analysis software that comes with it and which will also be available on the
campus network, accessible from the computer labs [(click here for
instructions)](207network.htm).   In addition, there will be a ["Do-Your-Own-
Exercise"](207exercise.htm) which will ask you to formulate your own
hypothesis and test it.  The five exercises will count for 20% of your grade;
the Do-Your-Own Exercise will count for an another 20%.  
To get full credit, these assignments must be handed in at the class for which
they are assigned, and **_must include a printout_** of the data for the final
question.   Late exercises will be accepted, but will be penalized ten points.
You will be responsible for the material taught through the exercises for the
exams.  
Two student assistants, [ Derrick Chin](mailto:derchin@camden.rutgers.edu) and
[Nakia Reese](mailto:nakiaeb@camden.rutgers.edu), will be available to assist
students with using the MicroCase program and doing the various exercises.
Periodic lab hours will be announced in class and in the Announcements box at
the top of this page. In addition you may email either of them to set up an
appointment as well.

Sociology  
Virtual Tours ** | In order to learn about sociological resources on the web,
you will be asked to complete two "Virtual Tour" assignments.  These virtual
tours ask you to explore a variety of sociologically-relevant websites, many
of them interactive ones where you call up specific information and analyze
it, and then submit your results electronically.  You must complete the
[Sociology Virtual Tour: Doing Sociology on the World Wide
Web](http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/%7Ewood/207virtualtourform.htm), as well as
one of the virtual tours (other than Tour A) at the [ Wadsworth Virtual Tour
site.](http://www.wadsworth.com/sociology_d/virtualtours.html#)  These two
exercises will together count for 10% of your grade.  _Please note: electronic
submission of your virtual tour answers constitutes a promise that you
accessed the sites and found the answers on your
own.[Plagiarism](http://sociology.camden.rutgers.edu/curriculum/plagiarism.htm)

**Technology and

  | This course is based on the dual convictions that technology can enhance
learning and that learning to use technology effectively is a critical job
skill for the 21st century.  The use of computer technology will be an
important part of this course, both in the classroom, where internet usage and
powerpoint presentations will be common, and in your coursework outside of
class.  All out-of-class coursework can be performed in one of the various
computer labs on campus.  If you use a home computer, it will be necessary to
have the Adobe Acrobat and RealPlayer plugins installed; most recent versions
of browsers include them.   If you need to download either of them, click on

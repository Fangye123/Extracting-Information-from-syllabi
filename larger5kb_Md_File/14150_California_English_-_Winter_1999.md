**ANAUDIENCE OF ONE'S PEERS**  
by Anna J. Small Roseboro

"O.K. Now let's write a one act play in a contemporary setting using the plot
of one of those traditional myths." So continues our eighth graders' language
arts unit that corresponds with their study in history of early Greek and
Roman civilizations. In our interdisciplinary humanities program, we teachers
strive to reduce the cells and bells quality from our curriculum. Rather than
teach in isolation the different disciplines of history, language arts,
science, and both the performing and visual arts, we teachers often develop
lessons that maintain the integrity of our own course content yet build on, or
provide the foundation for, what is studied in the other courses. (Lapp, Flood
and Ranck-Buhr, 105) So, when the history department teaches ancient
civilizations, in English we use their myths for our literature and writing
unit. And, because the performing arts teachers seek to offer scripts that
appeal to these eighth graders, we developed a project to have eighth graders
write myth plays, then perform them for their peers.

First we study a variety of myths \- stories of Titans, the gods, goddesses
and heroes of both Roman and Greek mythology; then we assign monologues. Each
student researchs one of these personages to learn the symbols, animals, and
other interesting facts and incidents involving these characters. Then they
write and present a two-three minute monologue in the persona of their god or
goddess. They may wear an item of clothing or bring a prop that symbolizes
their mythological character. This assignment gives them a hint of the
difference between written and spoken language and allows teachers to conduct
a stress-free assessment. Students show what they know; teachers have no
papers to grade. Evaluation takes place in class using a rubric or checklist
students have seen ahead of time. The criteria are similar to those
recommended by The California High School Speech Association. (CHSSA website)
Moreover, this monologue is a preliminary step toward writing a 10-15 minute
one-act play.

Next, we discuss some basic qualities of a one-act play. The students learn
that a play of this length usually is limited to two or three main characters
and that characterization and plot advancement occurs primarily through
dialogue. We discourage the use of narrators, encourage students to let the
dialogue and actions do the work. We discuss and choose a universal conflict
with a problem susceptible to solution in a short period of time - an hour, a
day, or a week. We remind the students to think carefully about rehearsal time
and the staging of their plays. Since their peers in the art classes design
and build the sets, these should be simple and safe. To deveope continuing
responses to their ideas, students work in groups of three or four. This
collaborative team of writers decides on a myth, a setting, and dialogue, and
uses the standard format for a play script. To test the effectiveness of some
scenes, students sometimes improvise before they commit to keeping some of the
ideas. (Korty, 44-45) We also share a sample play and provide a checklist to
guide their drafting. (See below.)

While students draft their scripts, they read them aloud to their teammates,
write revisions, then turn them in to us. We make brief written comments based
on the checklist, and then return the scripts for final revisions. Each group
now reads its final draft to the whole class, who notice that the stronger
plays tend to be those with a balance of language and action. (Korty, 13) By
secret ballot, students choose the play they think will be the most
interesting to perform. English teachers meet to read these class selections
and pass along our top choices to the drama teacher who decides on two or
three plays to offer to the eighth grade drama students who prepare for a
performance for their peers.

Four to six weeks later, the plays are performed for the students in the
middle school. By this time the visual arts classes will have designed and
built simple sets, the dance and vocal music classes may have choreographed
and rehearsed appropriate numbers, and the drama classes will have learned the
lines and movements for a performance of myth plays based on what the eighth-
graders have learned in history, science, and English classes. Imagine how
gratifying it is to hear students make the connection between their study of
the culture in history, astronomy in science, myths in literature, and
costumes and dance movements they've seen on ancient vases and friezes in art.

This cross-curricular drama project incorporates a variety of modes of
learning and assessment and is requires the students to demonstrate what they
have learned in a public way. These plays written, produced and performed by
students simultaneously meet several content area standards for language arts,
history, science, and the performing and visual arts. Equally important is the
increased collegiality among the faculty and the ease with which our students
have begun to make connections between what they learn in their different
courses.

Myth Play Check -Up List (see Sample Play that follows)

> Who are the two or three main characters in your play?  
>  What myth is the basis for your play?  
>  What do you want the audience to think, feel and know as a result of
reading or seeing your play? When does your play take place?  
>  Where does your play take place?  
>  * Simple set requirements?  
>  * Simple lighting required?  
>  Why are the characters in conflict? (universal issue)  
>  * Parent child disagreement  
>  * Sibling rivalry  
>  * Desire for power or glory  
>  * Peer pressure  
>  * Boy meets girl  
>  * Love triangle  
>  How well does your play follow the guidelines for an effective drama
script?  
>  * Plot is focused on a single problem to be solved within brief period of
time  
>  * Personality of characters is revealed primarily in dialogue; secondarily
in action  
>  * Dialogue introduces conflict early in the play  
>  * Dialogue sounds like real conversation - brief, overlapping speeches and
some fragments  
>  * Play has an identifiable beginning, middle and end to the play  
>  * Rising action includes three increasingly more challenging obstacles in
solving the problem  
>  * Climax is realistic, but not given away too soon  
>  * Resolution makes sense based on the personality of characters  
>  * Avoids use of narrator \- lets characters reveal themselves  
>  * Minor characters serve as foils or help reveal major characters  
>  * Suggests lighting, sets, and props, but lets dialogue guide the director
in his/her choices

(Sample myth play)

_Nothing New under the Sun_

1\. Greek tale selected: Apollo and Phaeton  
2\. Audience, when reading or viewing play should  
* Think: Myth tales are about human behavior seen today   
* Feel: Fathers know best   
* Know: Children seldom listen to their fathers   
3\. Scenario: Modern 16 year old boy wants to drive his father's sports car
against the advice  
of father, who then relates to the son the tale of Apollo and Phaeton

_Cast of Characters_

Father  
Son (about 16 years old)  
Apollo, the Sun-god  
Phaeton, his son (about 16 years old)

SCENE ONE  
_Modern day. Dad is sitting in comfortable chair reading the newspaper._
_Greek myth textbook is in view. Son enters the room._

Son: Dad, can I use the car tonight? You promised I could drive the next time
me and the guys went to the beach.  
Dad: _(absently)_ Yeah, son. You can drive.  
Son: I can drive the new car?  
Dad: _(Still distracted by paper)_. Yeah, son. I promised didn't I?  
Son: _(elated)_ Awright!!! I'll be hot tonight! They'll never believe it. My
Dad's new Ferrari! Whoa! Stick shift, too! Rrrmmbb! _(pantomiming shifting
gears, prancing around the stage)_.  
Dad: _(Alert now, putting down the paper.)_ What?  What're you talking about?
My Ferrari? You gotta be kidding. I meant the Ford Festiva. You can use the
new Festiva I just got for you and your sister.  
Son: But, Dad. You said  
Dad: That Ferrari is too powerful!. You wouldn't be able to handle those
curves going down to the beach .  
Son: But Dad. You promised. You'd never go back on your word, would you? You
always say that a man's word is his bond it's all he has. Dad, YOU PROMISED!  
Dad: _(Noticing the myth book, picks it up and flips through the pages.)_ Son,
this myth here, the one about Apollo and Phaeton, is a story about a father
and son in a situation much like ours. Maybe this tale will help you
understand why I can't let you drive my Ferrari. Maybe then you'll see that,
like Apollo, I know what's best for my son. Listen.  
Son: Ah, Dad. I don't have time to think about school stuff now. Anyway, it's
the weekend. The guys are waiting and you promised I could drive today . Oh,
awright.  I see you're gonna make me listen before you give me the keys.

END OF SCENE ONE

SCENE TWO  
_Time of Greek gods. Apollo is seated on golden throne, surrounded by bright
golden_ _light, almost blindingly brilliant. Phaeton enters, shading his eyes
with his hands._

Apollo: Well Phaeton. Come on in. What's on your mind?  
Phaet: Apollo, sir. The guys at school don't believe you're my dad. You know
because you're a god. .Mom says I'm your son, but when I tell the guys at
school, they just laugh. I want to know from you. Are you really my dad?  
Apollo: Sure, son. Your mom, Cylene, is right. I really am your father. Call
me, Dad.  It's just that my job requires me to travel a lot and I just don't
get to see you as much as I'd like.  Say, I'll prove I'm your father. Ask me
for anything. Anything you want and I promise by the River Styx, I'll grant
you your wish.  
Phaet: Really . _(hesitantly)_ Dad? Anything?  
Apollo: Sure, son. You know a promise sworn on the River Styx cannot be
broken.  
Phaet: O.K .Dad. d'you know what I'd like more than anything else in the
world?  

Apollo: Anything, son. You name it and it's yours.  
Phaet: Um Dad I want to drive your sun-chariot today.  ..When my friends see
me in that golden car, they'll believe me then. That'll show those guys that
I'm really the son of Apollo, the Sun-god. Yeah!! I'll look great!. I can see
me now _(cavorting around)_. Fast - up the eastern arc, zooming past all those
monsters, right across the sky. It'll be rad! Swooping down the western slope
.. WOW!  
Apollo: Hold it, son! I can't let you do that. Those horses are too powerful!.
You could never control them on those rising slopes and setting arcs. And the
monsters, the Crab, Scorpions, and the others .. Son, Leo, the lion, isn't a
pussycat! Those constellations aren't called monsters for nothing. Please,
Phaeton, reconsider that request. Isn't there something else, less dangerous,
you want? Make another wish, son.  

Phaet: No, Dad. This is what I really want. Anyway, you swore by the River
Styx. You have to keep your word.  
Apollo: You've got me there, son. But listen. You've got to show those horses
who's boss. Don't let them get off course or there'll be irreparable damage
all over the world.  
Phaet: Ah, Dad. I can control those horses. No sweat. I've driven before. Come
on. It's nearly time for sun rise. I can hardly wait. This'll show those guys
who I am. They won't dare call me those names again. Come on, Dad. Let's break
day!  
_They exit stage left._

END OF SCENE TWO

SCENE THREE  
_Modern day. Setting same as Scene One_

Dad: You know the rest, son. Phaeton nearly destroyed the earth with those
fiery horses. When those monsters frightened him, Phaeton lost control and let
go of the reins. The chariot went way off course. It went so high that some
parts of the earth froze and glaciers formed; it dipped so low in other places
that the earth scorched and deserts formed. Uncontrollable fires broke out and
caused so much devastation that Demeter, the earth goddess, begged Zeus to
intervene!  
Son: Yeah, and I bet Zeus hurled his lightening bolts and started rain showers
to put out the fires.  
Dad: That's about it, son. But, one of those bolts struck Phaeton. He fell out
of the chariot and into a river. The river nymphs buried him and put some
lines of poetry on his tombstone .uhm let's me see. It's here in your book. Oh
here it is  Here lies Phaeton who drove the sun god's car Greatly he failed
but he had greatly dared. So you see, son, children who ignore their parents'
advice come to no good end.  
Son: Yeah, Dad, but at least Apollo gave his son a chance. I still want to
drive to Ferrari. I'll be careful. Really, Dad. You know a kid can learn a
lessons from his schoolbooks sometime. I'll be careful. I promise.  
Dad: Well, you've got me there son. I guess parents can learn from lessons
from literature, too. You're right. I did promise. Here're the keys. And
please, son, respect the power of that car. I don't want to be weeping for you
like Apollo did for Phaeton.  
_[Son grabs the keys and rushes off STAGE LEFT. Sound of screeching tire
wheels peeling out of_ _the driveway.]_ Dad: _(holding and shaking his head.)_
I guess there's nothing new under the sun.

  **HOW DOES ONE _TEACH_ A PLAY ANYWAY?**  
by Edward L. Rocklin

A Shakespearean playtext is not a series of statements that specify in all
respects-or even all important respects-what must happen during performance.
Its statements do specify what cannot happen and in doing so they permit
whatever possibilities are not prohibited. (139)  
Philip McGuire, _Speechless Dialect: Shakespeare's Open Silences_ (1985)

In her call for manuscripts, Carol Jago asks two questions which, taken
together, provide an elegant prompt for the argument I want to offer in this
essay. She asks "And how does one 'teach' a play, anyway?" and "What does
drama do for readers and viewers that different genres cannot?" Briefly put,
if you understand what drama does that is different from poetry and prose
fiction, then you will also understand the most crucial starting point for
answering the question "How does one teach a play in a language arts or
English class?"

For purposes of analytic clarity and expository brevity, and recognizing that
the distinction may not be so neat in the classroom, I would suggest that one
teaches drama in two phases. In the first phase, you engage students in a
sequence of activities in which they contrast prose fiction and plays, and
thereby come to grasp the elements that constitute the dramatic medium. In the
second phase, you immerse students in an array of medium-specific strategies
that enable them to conduct performance-centered explorations of specific
plays. In short, you teach students to read and speak in what the American
director Harold Clurman called "another language." When you do this, you
discover that as students come to grasp the logic of that dramatic medium they
almost invariably become eager to master this language.

As many readers will recognize, I am proposing what is sometimes called, as a
short-hand label, a performance approach to teaching drama in literature
classes. But I would add that in this model the concept of performance is
defined more widely than simply "as if one were preparing to perform the play
in the theater." While the core of a performance approach is to have students
analyze, cast, rehearse, memorize (sometimes), and perform part of a play,
that core also includes asking them to observe, respond to, and critique these
performances-and to move recursively between the page and the performance.
Performance, furthermore, extends to a wide array of activities, many of them
using traditional literary concepts and practices to explore the text, but
with an eye for what can and cannot be projected when that text is acted. Thus
when I say that students must learn to read differently, I mean that they must
learn to read as experimenters, asking not only "What do these words mean?"
but also "What do these words do?" and "What can these words be made to do?"

Let me offer one very simple example of how drama demands that we learn to
read "in a different language," and what the consequences of reading in this
fashion can be. The example I want to analyze here, one of the most famous
lines in all of Shakespeare, is Hamlet's first speech, "A little more than
kin, and less than kind." But given the premises I am advocating, when I teach
the play I have to ask students to experiment with the visual introduction
that precedes our verbal introduction to Hamlet. So I start by asking
questions such as How is Hamlet dressed? When does he enter? Where do he
position himself? Or is his position controlled by others (perhaps by non-
verbal orders from Claudius or Polonius, perhaps by other courtiers who either
move toward or away from him)? Next, we need to analyze the speech itself,
appreciating the way its pattern reveals its speaker as one who deploys
precise, elegant, and witty phrasing.

But most of all we need to explore what the speech does, and to do that
students need to pay attention to how the speech appears on the page of a
specific edition. Here is how it appears on the page of _The Riverside
Shakespeare_ (2nd edition, 1997: p. 1192):

> King. But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son-  
>  Hamlet. [Aside.] A little more than kin, and less than kind.  
>  King. How is it that the cloud still hangs on you? (I.ii.64-66)

Concentrate for a moment not on the spoken words but on that bracketed
"Aside." The stage direction is in brackets, I explain to students, because it
does not appear in either the Second Quarto (1604) or the First Folio (1623)
texts of the play: rather, it has been added by almost all editors, beginning
with Lewis Theobold in 1737\. But once you realize that it is not mandated by
the original texts of the play, you are free to explore this as a performance
choice. This means setting aside, for the moment, the question "Is it a right
or wrong editorial decision?" in order to ask "What happens if Hamlet performs
this line as an aside? What happens if he speaks the line to one or more other
members of the court? And what happens if he speaks the line directly to the
King?" Furthermore, introducing another crucial practice necessary for
learning to read differently, for each of these questions we must ask not only
"What happens within the world of the play?" but also "What happens in terms
of the play-audience relationship?"

If Hamlet speaks these words as an aside, as editors direct and as most
performers choose to do, then the speech marks him not only as someone who is
verbally witty, but as someone whose wit must be used privately to express his
contempt for an uncle-step-father-king; and the fact that the line is spoken
as an aside is itself one enactment of his alienated situation. Furthermore,
in the second dimension, by opening a gap between himself and all the other
dramatis personae, Hamlet also initiates a direct relationship in which we,
the spectators, become his confidants, preparing us for the role of tacit co-
conspirators which we assume during some of his soliloquies-especially the
soliloquy (only of course it is not a soliloquy) where Hamlet stands over the
praying Claudius and decides to murder the King and then to murder him another
day.

But what if, as the original texts of the play seem to permit, Hamlet speaks
his first words directly to the King? Then, as students immediately realize,
while the wit of the word-play remains the same, that wit is now being used to
publicly challenge the new ruler, and to challenge him both as king and as
step-father. In terms of the play's design, furthermore, this means that the
King faces both an external challenge from Fortinbras and an internal
challenge from the presumptive heir to the throne during his first public
performance in his new office. This also means that the King's next speech
represents his deliberate choice to ignore the challenge from Hamlet. One of
the simplest but most fundamental premises we must master in learning to read
drama, in short, is to recognize that the same speech can be used to perform
different or even radically divergent speech acts.

Small as it is, this example neatly embodies four key premises in the
performance model proposed here. First, students need to learn that when a
character speaks, he or she is doing something through language: to repeat
this vital point, while the words of Hamlet's first speech and the King's
reply remain the same in any performance, the speech acts they perform can be
significantly different. Second, students need to learn how to read not just
the speeches but the whole range of elements in a playtext including, for
example, both explicit and implicit stage directions. Third, students need to
learn how to read Shakespeare's texts with an understanding of what editors
contribute to these texts; and with a sense of how such editorial choices may
at once clarify but also foreclose performance options. And fourth, students
need to learn how to read as experimenters, asking "What happens if we perform
a speech this way? Or that way? Or a third way?"

This example also makes clear that students will need to learn to ask a
further question, namely "Will playing this speech in this particular way work
with the rest of the scene's or the play's design? Or are there some other
elements of that design that further constrain our choices?" At this point,
too, we can return to asking whether the editorial tradition adding the
"Aside" accurately responds to elements in the play's design.

From my own experience, I know that it can be wonderfully liberating for
students to discover that different Hamlets can either be sharing their
contempt as a secret with us, putting us in a one-up position; or be directly
confronting the new ruler with a challenge to his authority that forces the
King to make an instantaneous decision as to how he will meet this insulting
action from his step-son-nephew-prince. (I also know that learning to read in
this way can be unsettling for a certain number of students, as it is
unsettling for some readers and critics, who are more comfortable with a
determinate text.) But in learning to read these elements of the language of
drama, and in learning to read as experimenters, students will also have the
opportunity to experience the power and delight of becoming co-creators with
Shakespeare of the play in performance.

There are at least four other benefits, furthermore, that you may gain from
using a performance approach to drama. First of all, a performance approach
compels students to externalize some elements of the act of reading itself.
And the externalized acts of reading help you as a teacher to hear and see how
students are reading, where they are having problems, and what some of those
problems are. Second, it offers students opportunities to speak a very rich
version of English which invites them to experience not only the poetry but
the power of language as a form of action. Third, it also offers them an
opportunity to employ their bodies to enact language, which will give many of
them a greater sense of mastering that language-and discovering its implicit
cues to action. And fourth, from my own experience and from the experience of
a number of other teachers who have taught students to read drama in this
manner, if students have an extended opportunity to read in a different
language, they will eventually also reverse their tendency to read drama the
way they read prose fiction. Instead, they will begin to recognize and respond
to the dramatic elements in non-dramatic literature. And when they do, they
will become more deeply engaged with, and offer interesting and innovative
interpretations of, dialogue in prose works such as Book I of Utopia; as well
as the wide array of dramatic monologues and dialogues from Donne to Browning
to Frost and beyond. You might also find yourself assigning monologues and
dialogues when you teach composition-returning, that is, to one of the oldest
forms of writing. But that is the subject for another issue of _California
English_.

**TEACHING _THEWINSLOW BOY_**  
by Thomas Turk

The recent release of American playwright David Mamet's film of British
playwright Terence Rattigan's The _Winslow Boy_ was a surprise. Even though I
have been teaching it for several years, I thought that only Shakespeare was
enjoying a cinematic revival, not English plays 50 years young.

Even though this is not an easy play to find, it is well worth the effort,
because high school students love it. Rattigan's play shows modern students
that familial relationships can be high drama if dramatic technique is
artfully directed inward, a concept that students rarely get to experience,
since they are frequently nourished on the ubiquitous mall cinema fare where
abusive put-downs, limited language and special effects account for all the
show and damn the substance.

_The Winslow Boy_ is an English pre-World War I domestic drama built around
the sacrifices every member of a family must make, voluntarily or not, in
order to secure the good name of the youngest boy. The youngest, Ronnie, has
been expelled from Osborne Naval Academy for allegedly stealing a small postal
order. Ronnie's father, Arthur Winslow, cannot get his day in court because
the academy, being royal, belongs to the Crown and the Crown cannot be sued.
Enter one of England's most famous barristers (the very one who prosecuted
Oscar Wilde) who informs Arthur that Ronnie may have his day in court if the
Crown agrees.

The Crown eventually relents, "Ronnie versus Rex" can proceed, and great
dramatic machinations result. The oratorical debates about the case in
Parliament and the government's preoccupation with possible war with Germany
would seem to be the stuff of great drama. But as students read the play, they
notice that Rattigan, by keeping all the public ruckus offstage, focuses the
drama on the interaction and tension between family members. The result is an
affecting story about family, friends, identity and yearning for love and
acceptance amid a maelstrom of public commotion.

Ronnie's guilt or innocence is immaterial resolved early in the play, allowing
Rattigan to focus on the issue of familial sacrifice and inevitable social
change. Students identify with the children of the family, especially the
older brother who puts partying above college and his sister who is a turn-of-
the-century feminist. Since this is a British middle class family, there is a
loyal maid, whose major purpose in the play is to announce the great decisions
which happen off stage. The latter function is essential to Rattigan's
domestic drama, since typically in life great changes are not announced in the
grand manner but by more familiar means.

I ask students what would happen to this play if Hollywood filmed it, and they
immediately respond that there would be great dramatic scenes in both
Parliament and the Admiralty, thereby robbing the play of its domestic virtues
and obscuring the real issues. It is clear that the patriarch, Arthur Winslow,
is solely interested in his son's good name, not with making new law for the
British Isles. Modern students read the play with great respect for a father
who would suffer deprivation and public ridicule to clear his son's name.
Herein lies the real drama of the piece, and it rests on Rattigan's artful use
of language and careful staging.

Students also realize that the title character is not the main character in
the play (it's a tossup between the father and his daughter Catherine - food
for a lively classroom discussion), but his presence is a catalyst for the
other members of the household. In fact, I originally settled on this play
when I read an Advanced Placement English literature question that read, "In
some works of literature, a character who appears briefly, or does not appear
at all, is a significant presence. Choose a novel or play of literary merit
and write an essay in which you show how such a character functions in the
work. You may wish to discuss how the character affects action, theme, or the
development of other characters." I immediately thought that _The Winslow Boy_
should be given a chance in a U.S. high school classroom. Since then, my
students have used issues in this play to answer the free response questions
on the AP literature exam.

Normally I am cautious about recommending cinematic interpretations of
literary works, but plays are the exception, since they are intended to be
staged. The first movie, Anthony Asquith's 1948 British version, with
Rattigan's help and in the interest of visual appeal, deviated from the play
by offering some dramatic sequences in Parliament. However, when Mamet
announced a year ago he was working on his version of _The Winslow Boy_ , I
asked my students to think how a playwright would treat another playwright's
work. As it turns out, Mamet's adaptation is so faithful to Rattigan that my
students cannot believe it; when it comes to adapting good writing, we are not
used to fidelity in film. In fact, many reviewers remarked particularly on
Mamet's fastidious attention to Rattigan's dramatic technique of concentrating
on the domestic rather than public issues. The movie certainly reflects this
along with attention to setting and manners, down to the women as they go
through their daily routines trussed up in those period corsets.

_The Winslow Boy_ is a popular play in Britain, since it is based on a true
story that upheld the notion of justice inherent in Magna Carta. But other
than the point of law which helps to drive the play, Rattigan has introduced
issues that hint at even greater consequences about to engulf Britain with the
coming of the Great War.

For example, the relationship between the progressive daughter and the aloof
and arch-conservative lawyer, Sir Robert, is an important subplot, since it is
a subtle love story in the context of social change. And we are given further
evidence of social change by references to new forms of amusement
(gramophones) and teenage dances (the bunny hug?), socialized medicine,
women's suffrage, and female employment outside the home in typically male
professions.

Students should pay close attention to particularly British terms such as
pinching, barrister, solicitor and suffragette vs. the American term
suffragist. Note also the property list, which contributes to both setting and
theme: "old sweater in horn;" "Punch;" "bottle of Madeira;" "prayer-books;"
"old fashioned gramophone;" and "text books." These props emphasize that this
is a story set not only in the midst of change, but also a story that is
rooted in some traditions that have never changed.

Finally, I require students to choose among several essays designed to exploit
the various themes or issues in the play. I have largely paraphrased some AP
type questions; here are some samples: 1. Show how _The Winslow Boy_ focuses
attention on the principle of fundamental rights and on the sacrifices which
people of principle \- Sir Robert, Arthur and Catherine - have to make to
uphold such vital principles, rather than on the lesser issue of whether
Ronnie is innocent or not; 2. Injustice, either social or personal, is a
common theme in literature. Write an essay in which you define clearly the
nature of the injustice in _The Winslow Boy_ , and discuss the techniques the
author employs to elicit sympathy for his victims; 3. Minor characters are
necessary because of the various functions they perform, such as providing
humor, helping to forward the plot, reporting events which happen off-stage,
or revealing what the main characters are like. Name the characters in _The
Winslow Boy_ whom you consider minor and explain what each contributes to the
play; 4. How does Rattigan's dramatic technique emphasize his theme(s)?

As for classic parallels, compare Shakespeare's Brutus and Rattigan's Arthur
Winslow as they weigh the price of loyalty to family and friends in their
search "to do the right thing," the old Roman notion of parental
responsibility embodied in paterfamilias. I explain to my students that the
Roman virtue of family honor is still a very modern virtue; we are latter day
Romans who know that a family, above all else, still trades on its good name.

This is a great play to read aloud; it offers exquisite language, subtle humor
and fine characterizations that appeal to students. How many modern plays, or
movies for that matter, expose students to family life in which the characters
are not stereotypes, ridiculous caricatures or incapable of rational thought
and good language? How many dramatic stories do our students read in which the
theme, "let right be done," if it exists at all, is treated as a virtuous
pursuit?

This is a play modern adolescents care about; I hope your students will agree.

**W;T IN THE HIGH-SCHOOL CLASSROOM**  
by Nancy Harray

Would Margaret Edson's Pulitzer Prize winning play _W;t_ about a John Donne
professor dying of ovarian cancer engage high school students?

Without experiencing this play in a theater (if students could, so much the
better), could students care about its acerbic protagonist, Vivian Bearing?
Even Edson "isn't quite sure she likes Vivian" (Gamerman), but although high
school students may not warm to her immediately, her grim humor will make them
curious. Consider these sentences from her opening lines:  
I have been asked "How are you feeling today?" while I was throwing up into a
plastic washbasin. I have been asked as I was emerging from a four-hour opera-
tion with a tube in every orifice, "How are you feeling today?"

I am waiting for the moment when someone asks me this question and I am dead.
Iam a little sorry Iall miss that.(5)

It may also interest students to learn that Edson is the first kindergarten
teacher to win a Pulitzer, and that she calls the classroom "much more
exciting than the theater"(Peyser). Perhaps her excitement about teaching, an
excitement that resonates in her play, is one of several ways into the play
for high school students.

As my son, the actor, pointed out to me, one real draw for high school
students is the examination of student-teacher relationships at the heart of
this play. My honest first reaction was to wince and wonder if I wanted to
stick around for that discussion. But now I think I do.

STUDENT-TEACHER RELATIONSHIPS  
As veterans of many teachers' "classroom manners," students are well qualified
to evaluate any of these student-teacher relationships in _W;t :_ Vivian's
relationship with her mentor, E.M. Ashford; her own uncompromising
perfectionism as scholar and teacher, which is not unlike the driving
singlemindedness of the doctors in her  ateaching hospitala; her new role as a
student of her own disease; and her final exchange with her nurse Susie, who
has been both her teacher and her student.

Evaluating these relationships could shed light on students' own experiences
and on Vivianas transformation from teacher to student near the end of the
play:

I can't. . . There aren't. . . I'm like a student and this is the final exam
and I don't know what to put down because I donat understand the question and
Iam run- ning out of time . (70)

Although Vivian becomes a groping student, her last line is as triumphant and
paradoxical as any of Donne's: "I'm a teacher."

An examination of student-teacher relationships could also focus on the
flashbacks and fantasy scenes in which Vivian and her mentor discuss
punctuation in John Donne's "Death be not proud"--and a 1942 children's book,
_The Runaway Bunny_. Edson gives the children's book great importance, asking
the audience to set its message beside Donne's. Analyzing these texts within
the play could help students remember and consider important experiences with
teachers and texts in their own education.

For English teachers especially, _W;t_ strikes close to home as Vivian,
marveling at the relentless scrutiny the doctors give her cancer, exclaims,
"Now I know how poems feel" (16). Another good discussion topic concerns what
teachers should do when students complain that the teacher is killing a poem
for them with analysis.

And Vivian's young doctor Jason, her former student, reminisces with a nurse
about Vivian's class, "It felt more like boot camp than English class."(75)
The play underscores Edson's attitudes toward smart classroom bullies,
teachers or students:  aIam not saying smart is bad. . .Smart is not bad--but
kind is good" (Gamerman). What do students think about balancing the
acquisition of "smart" and "kind" in our classrooms?

If _W;t_ hooks high school students into considering how they learn and what
they learn, they will be ready for Edson as interest in punctuation,
metaphysical wit, specialized vocabulary, and the patient-doctor relationship,
which can bring them full circle as Edson compares students to patients,
teachers to doctors.

PUNCTUATION  
"It's a very peculiar play," says Edson. "One of its themes is punctuation"
(Peyser). How about those semi-colons punctuating items in a series in
paragraph three of this essay? Hardly a life or death matter, right? But
punctuation becomes a matter of life or death in _W;t_ , because Vivian's
mentor has one way of punctuating this Donne paradox, Vivian another:  
And Death shall be no more--comma or semicolon?--  
Death thou shalt die--period or exclamation point?

In this play punctuation is critical; anyone who cares about the play cares
about the punctuation of this line--and begins to care about the seventeenth
century use of wit, its clever word play and paradox.

METAPHYSICAL WIT  
The first time Vivian's mentor explains the underlined line above to her,
Vivian says,"Life, death. . . I see. (Standing) It's a metaphysical conceit.
It's wit!"(15)  
However, when she is the professor, her clever, playful students ask an
important question about Donne's paradoxes: "Why does Donne make everything so
complicated ? No, really, why ?" (60) The same student gives an intriguing
answer:  
I think it's like he's hiding. I think he's really confused, I don't know,
maybe he's scared, so he hides behind all this complicated stuff, hides behind
this wit. (60)

Instead of helping the student to articulate an important insight, she lets
the student flounder until she observes, "Lost it" (61). Vivian claims
students can't understand paradox, but Edson makes the concept accessible when
Vivian observes,  
"My treatment imperils my health."  
Herein lies the paradox. John Donne would revel in it. I would revel in it if
he wrote a poem about it. (47)

With Edson's clear exposition, paradox and metaphysical conceits become
concepts that students can understand.

SPECIALIZED VOCABULARIES  
Edson emphasizes the specialized vocabularies that both English professors and
doctors employ. In a flashback to Vivian's childhood, her father is explaining
the word "soporific," and to her "it seemed like magic" (43). Her fascination
with language grows as she encounters the words of John Donne: "ratiocination,
concatenation, coruscation, tergiversation" (43). These words fill her with
delight and give her professional power over her colleagues and students, but
during her illness medical words affect her differently:  
" Medical terms are less evocative. Still, I want to know what the doctors
mean when they. . .anatomize me. And I will grant that in this particular
field of endeavor they possess a more potent arsenal of termi-/ nology than I.
My only defense is the acquisition of vocabulary." (43-44)

How do students feel about the "acquisition of vocabulary"? Do they ever share
Vivianas delight in Donne's long words? Do they ever acquire vocabulary
desperately to try to understand what is happening to them (like the terms
Susie explains to Vivian--full code and DNR)? Do they ever feel included or
excluded because of vocabulary? Comparing Vivianas experiences with their own
could give them a thoughtful, personal understanding of the uses of
specialized vocabularies.

PATIENT-DOCTOR RELATIONSHIPS  
Vivian's need to understand medical terms has an urgency students can
appreciate: she is terminally ill. What are the medical issues the play
invites students to examine?

Tom Mayo, a college professor with degrees in law and medicine, includes _W;t_
in a reading list for a course for medical and law students, but his course
goals could easily inform discussions and projects in high school English,
science, and social studies:  
... to introduce students to the study of literature as a way of gaining
exposure to human experience and the ethical dilemmas of daily practice
through the writing of master story-tellers. to underline the importance of a
humane and humanistic professional education and outlook--to develop students
a sensitivity to the human dimension of their professional lives; to introduce
students to the notion that most of the information they will deal with in
their professional lives is organized and transmitted in narrative form--
judicial opinions, client and patient stories (in the form of complaints,
histories, etc.), and practical, clinical information (what worked the last
time it was tried--in court or with a type of patient). In that vein, it is
useful for students to sharpen their narrative skills by reading and
discussing great stories; and to introduce students to a form of professional,
case-based moral reasoning. . .

Vivian's oncologist is Dr. Kelekian, a reverse Kevorkian who wants his
patients to survive devastating rounds of treatment, because, Vivian
speculates, he and her younger doctor Jason "foresee celebrity status for
themselves upon the appearance of the journal article they will no doubt write
about me" (53). Their cold research focus contrasts with the caring that
Vivian receives from her primary nurse Susie. It is Susie who informs Vivian
of her right to choose to between "full code" and "DNR." Should Kelekian or
Jason have informed Vivian? Students who ponder this point in the play may
become interested in exploring patients' rights.

Is Edson too tough on doctors? Are Edson's doctors, as Sherwin Nuland has
claimed, "stick figures, straw men, caricatures of the worst, completely
unrealistic" (qtd. in Zuger)? Just as Edson invites educators to balance
"smart" and "kind," she suggests that doctors should balance their brilliant
research with a humane outlook and a sharp eye for "the ethical dilemmas of
daily practice."

I'm not sure which of my own suggestions I will follow with my students this
year--whether Vivian's punctuation of "Death, be not proud" will make a mere
cameo appearance in a semicolon lesson, or whether _W;t_ will have a starring
role in helping students reflect on their own education. Of course, if the
drama teacher should read the script and want to perform it. . . I'd have no
choice but to give _W;t_ center stage.

  **SIDEWALK SHAKESPEARE**  
by Sarah Innerst Peterson

Last year a friend of mine who teaches high school approached me with great
excitement. "I get to teach my students a full length novel!" she said. "I've
chosen _Hamlet._ " (Even as I write this I can hear your gasps and chuckles.)
I have worked in the theatre for most of my life, indeed I have a Theatre Arts
degree. I feel a deep and abiding love for the performing arts and had never,
up to that day, considered _Hamlet_ to be anything other than a play intended
for live performance. And yet I could not fault her for her intention of
teaching the play as a piece of literature.

The fact of the matter is, as one of my colleagues often points out, that
Shakespeare's plays have been more read than seen. In that sense, of course,
_Hamlet_ can be, and is, studied as literature. I will go even further and say
that students can benefit from studying Shakespeare as literature in ways that
they can not benefit from studying Shakespeare as drama. However (and I'm sure
you saw that coming ), studying Shakespeare as drama, in fact, studying
Shakespeare as performing artists studying drama, broadens students'
perspectives in at least three distinct ways: it provides a creative focus for
their artistic gifts; it encourages them to take part in a discussion of
artistic interpretation not only with their fellow students, but, in the case
of public performances, with people outside of the classroom as well; and,
finally, it prompts them to discover themselves as active and productive
artists in a community of artists. But before students can do any of these
things they must internalize the play in certain ways. By internalize, I mean
that they must view the play from the inside, looking out through the eyes of
a character's circumstance and environment. They must, in other words, come to
an emotional and intellectual understanding of what drives a character, the
characters, and the play.

In 1995 I found myself faced with a unique opportunity to apply my love of
Shakespeare and performing to a teaching situation, in the creation of
Sidewalk Shakespeare. This was a series of workshops for children, ages 8-11,
that used the plays of Shakespeare as a vehicle to explore Shakespeare, the
Elizabethan theatre, and aspects of theatre production. Although my
experiences with Sidewalk Shakespeare took place in a workshop setting, rather
than in an English classroom, I feel they may be of use to classroom teachers
because, especially in the case of the scenework I will be describing, they
demonstrate the usefulness of what many might call a "performance model" in
enabling students to internalize a play.

Our first workshop was on _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ -a play I chose because
its settings, plots and sense of fun seemed especially appropriate for
children. Although on the first day of our workshop I had an idea of where I
wanted the students to go, I was unsure just what we would need to do to get
there. As it turns out, we ended up basically working through the scene five
times: once for basic comprehension of the actions in the scene; once to
unpack some of the difficulties concerning the language in the scene; once as
a sort of initial exploration of performance in general; once to come to a
physical understanding of the characters; and once to come to an emotional
understanding of the characters.

We began with the second scene, in which we are introduced to Bottom and
Quince and the plot concerning Theseus' nuptial festivities is first
presented. I randomly selected readers and we dove in and read the scene in
its entirety. I gave no direction to them concerning the plot within this
scene nor the characters and their motivations. The group's goal was just to
get through the scene without stopping; my own

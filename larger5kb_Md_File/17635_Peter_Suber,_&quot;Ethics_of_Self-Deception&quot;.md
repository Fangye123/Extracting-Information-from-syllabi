Beck, Macmillan, 1956 (original 1788).

>   2. Mike Martin, _Self-Deception and Morality_ , University of Kansas

Amelie Oksenberg Rorty (eds.), _Perspectives on Self-Deception_ , University
of California Press, 1988.

>

> I've created a course home-page containing a collection of hand-outs and
course-related web links at
<http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/courses/selfdec/dechome.htm>. If you find any
other relevant links, let me know and I'll add them to the collection.

>

> Works and pages cited for a given day will be discussed or presupposed that
day in class and should have been read in advance. Works and pages in brackets
are recommended but not required. Unless stated otherwise, assignments are due
at class time.

>

> The Beck translation of Kant's second _Critique_ exists in two forms, one
from Macmillan (in print, assigned for class), and one from Bobbs-Merrill (out
of print, but available used). The pagination differs slightly from one
edition to the other. I give the Kant assignments first using the Macmillan
page numbers and then, when they differ, using the Bobbs-Merrill page numbers.

> ## Work Summary

>

>   * Two case studies, 5-8 pages each.

>   * One long paper, 10+ pages, on one of our authors other than Kant.

>   * One medium length paper, 5-8 pages, on Kant.

>   * Take turns giving oral presentations and leading discussions during the
first hour of our Thursday meetings.

>   * Helpful participation in every discussion.

>   * One evaluation form

>

> ### Case Studies

>

> Find a first-person account of a moral decision or act, analyze it for
traces of self-deception (or bad faith, false consciousness, ideology), and
assess the significance of those traces of self-deception, if any, to the
moral worth of the decision or act. I can suggest some examples, but half the
fun will be to find your own. The accounts will be more useful if they justify
or defend the action, not merely describe it.

>

> Write for an audience that has not read the first-person account you are
using. Summarize (paraphrase and quote) the aspects of the account on which
you base your diagnosis and analysis.

>

> We'll spend two days of class time doing a case study together ([Thoreau's
"Civil Disobedience"](http://www.earlham.edu/~peters/writing/disobey.htm)) in
Week 6. One of your case study papers will be due before those discussions,
the other one after.

>

> The risk in these papers is not so much misinterpretation or weak argument,
but the potshot. Before you accuse your author of self-deception, be sure you
have some persuasive evidence. (On this point, see Martin's advice at p. 37.)

>

> ### Long paper

>

> Ask a sharp question about any aspect of self-deception (bad faith, false
consciousness, ideology) in ethics, reconstruct the answer of one of our
authors, with its supporting argument, and then evaluate the strengths and
weaknesses of the author's position and argument. For more details on the
assignment, see the [generic hand-out](../generic.htm).

>

> I'll want your question, and the author you will be working with, a week
before the paper is due.

>

> You may incorporate work done in your case studies, if relevant.

>

> ### Kant paper

>

> Here the assignment is the same as in the long paper, but the author must be
Kant and the topic question need not concern self-deception.

>

> If you give me a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your final paper,
then I will mail it to you after I grade it. Otherwise you'll have to pick it
up next fall.

>

> ### Oral presentations, leading discussion

>

> The first hour of most Thursdays is reserved for student presentations and
discussions. The assignment is for the presenter to offer a 15-20 minute
presentation on a problem, question, position, or argument in the reading for
that day. The presentation should include a reading or interpretation of the
text for that day, but may go well beyond it, e.g. to criticism, applications,
significance, influence, and so on. I encourage presenters to draw on library
research, although it is not necessary. After the presentation the same
student will lead the class in a discussion of the issues raised in the
presentation. For more information, see the [hand-out on giving presentations
and leading discussions](../leaddisc.htm).

>

> Sign up for a Thursday as soon as can; they will be allocated first-come,
first-served. You will present and lead alone, not in teams, unless there are
not enough slots to match the enrollment. You may have to go more than once if
there are too few students to fill every slot.

>

> On the day of your presentation, please submit a short (2-4 pp.) paper on
the issues, questions, or material of your presentation, and the questions or
plan for your discussion afterwards. They must be typed and cannot receive
extensions. They are described more fully in the [presentation hand-
out](../leaddisc.htm).

>

> Please observe these aspects of the presentation:

>

>   * Presentations should be 15-20 minutes in length. This time is for your
own well-organized reflections on the material, not for leading discussion.

>   * Do not read your presentations, although of course you may consult notes
as you speak.

>   * When leading discussion after your presentation, do not simply ask
questions and hope that someone answers them. You need not have answers to
every question you raise, but should raise good questions, know where in the
text to look for answers, and have a plan for leading a discussion that might
discover answers. Plan the discussion that follows your presentation as
carefully as you plan your presentation. For example, prepare to create a
context for each question so we know where it comes from or why it matters.

>   * Help your peers who are presenting and leading discussion. They will be
nervous but knowledgeable. Listen closely, speak voluntarily, follow up points
of interest.

>   * I will be glad to meet with presenters and discussion leaders beforehand
to discuss topics and methods.

>

> ### Grade Weights

>

> The final grade is based on these elements with these weights:

>

> two case studies | 20% (10% each)  
> ---|---  
> Non-Kant paper | 25%  
> Kant paper | 20%  
> oral presentations | 10%  
> participation | 25%  
>  
> "Participation" includes (1) attendance, (2) preparation, (3) quality of
oral contributions. All assigned work must be completed to pass the course.

****Course description****

**  
  
**

**This course is a survey of major events and trends in World History since
1450. While it is not our objective (nor would it be possible) to cover
**everything** , we will try not to neglect any part of the globe. Your
instructor is a specialist in Russian and East European history; he will
attempt to integrate his specialist knowledge into the lectures but will make
a sincere effort to avoid overly "Eurocentric" views and argumentation. Still,
in modern world history, Europe will occupy a very important position, for
better or (very often, as in the case of the Atlantic Slave Trade,
imperialism, the Holocaust) for worse. Our course will trace the "rise and
fall" of European global hegemony from the creation of the modern state in
western Europe and the voyages of discovery of the later 15th century to the
utter collapse and destruction of Europe in 1945, and beyond. We will not
entirely neglect developments in the USA, but will treat these only when they
are important for world history. One of the lessons of this course is that
from 1492 onwards, the globe began to shrink, and this process has picked up
speed greatly in the past two or three generations. So, hang onto your hat and
be prepared for a quick and sometimes bumpy ride: World History is always
demanding but (I hope) not dull.**

**  
  
**

****Course objectives****

**1) _to think historically_ : understanding cause and effect, learning to
frame a thesis and argument about the causes for historical change;**

**2) _to think globally_ : learning to recognize the increasingly close
connections (political, economic, cultural, environmental) between different
states and regions;**

**3) _to learn about specific important events and trends_ : this will involve
learning to identify a certain number of significant people, important
occurrences, concepts, sociological and economic periods and trends, perhaps
even some dates!**

**4) _to recognize how societies and states (political units) develop_ : this
will combine all three of the objectives mentioned above and will involve
developing your understand of how specific events, economic trends
(capitalism, industrialization), political ideologies (liberalism,
authoritarianism, socialism) work as agents of change in history and in our
own lives.**

**  
  
**

****Course Requirements and Grading****

**1) Two hour exams (taken in class, weeks 5 and 10): 20%**

**2) Two short (2-4 pp., double-spaced and typed) "position papers" in which
you take a stand on an important historical issue (weeks 3 & 13): 20%**

**3) Four quizzes (held unannounced in lecture or section -- and not "make-up-
able"): 20%**

**4) Attendance and Participation (in ** _discussion sections)_** 20%**

**5) Final examination: 20%**

**  
  
**

****Reminders, Rules, Recommendations, Free Advice****

**1) Please take notes during the lectures. Please ** _don't_** talk, read
newspapers, yawn ostentatiously, or leave before the lecture ends. If for some
reason you cannot stay to the bitter end, please sit near the exit to minimize
disruption.**

**2) All assignments must be turned in on time. **PLEASE, NO LATE PAPERS.****

**3) Read the text assignment ** _before_** lecture. This will help you take
notes.**

**4) Read the primary document (reader) assignment before section meeting.
This will enable you to participate in the discussion.**

**5) If you have specific needs, desires, or problems - please let us know. We
can't always make special arrangements, but we will do our best.**

**6) Keep in contact with your TA. If you need to miss more than one section
meeting in a row, let him know.**

**7) Exams must be taken on the dates given (February 14, March 27, May 11).
Make-up exams will be scheduled (a) ** _only_** for extremely unusual and
completely unavoidable absences and (b) **_only_** when the student contacts
the TA or professor (453-7874) in advance. _Please_ ** _do not expect_** _us
to make up a special exam for you!_**

**8) We expect and will promote an atmosphere of mutual respect and courtesy -
which includes respect for ideas you might not immediately like or
understand.**

**8x) Reviewing lectures notes **after each lecture** or at least weekly and
learning the IDs "as we go" will give vastly better results than cramming the
night before the exams.**

**9) If you have suggestions on how to improve the lectures or section
meetings, let us know!**

**10) Obviously, " [wo]man proposes and God disposes" - if you need special
help or "a break," at least ask - the worst we can do is to say no.**

**  
  
  
  
**

****Statement on Plagiarism and Cheating****

**Plagiarism is defined as "taking and passing off as one's own the writings
or ideas of another person." If you are unsure where the boundary between
appropriate use of sources and plagiarism lies, consult your TA or
instructor.**

**  
  
**

**Any student who plagiarizes or cheats will be subject to the penalties
listed in the Student Conduct Code - this could mean failing the exam or
paper, or failing the course, or even being removed from the university.
Please don't put yourself and us in a horrible position by taking this risk -
** _do your own work_**.**

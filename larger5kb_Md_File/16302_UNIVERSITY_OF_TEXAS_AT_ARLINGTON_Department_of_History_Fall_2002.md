Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live.  
Exodus 22:18

It is commonly the nature of women to be timid and  
to be afraid of everything. That is why they busy  
themselves so much about witchcraft and superstitions  
and run hither and thither, uttering a magic formula  
here and a magic formula there.  
Martin Luther ( _Sermon on 1 Peter_ )

A woman promoted to sit in the seat of God, that is,  
to judge or to reign above a man, is a monster in nature, contumely to God,  
and a thing most repugnant to his will and ordinance.  
John Knox ( _The First Blast of the Trumpet Against the  
  Monstrous Regiment of Women_)

For this is man's nature, that where he is persuaded that  
there is the power to bring prosperity and adversity, there  
will he worship.  
George Gifford (1587)

One ought not believe everything about a man, because a man  
can say anything. No, I do not believe in Witches, even  
though several important people do not agree with me; and  
I defer to no man's authority, unless it is accompanied by  
reason . . . . Reason alone is my ruler, to whom I  
voluntarily pay homage.  
Cyrano de Bergerac (1654)  

**Course Description** : Europe between 1500 and 1715 is the focus of this
course, which examines how Western Europeans acquired the "modern" technology,
economic system, political organization, and world view that not only enabled
them to gain greater control over nature but also empowered them to expand far
beyond their borders. The course is organized thematically (around major
topics) and chronologically (around the histories of major countries).

Our first focus will be on the crucial transition from traditional ways of
thinking to a world-view we call "scientific." We therefore begin by
investigating the magico-religious beliefs and practices of medieval
Europeans, the impact of the Reformation on traditional world-views, the Great
Witch-Hunt that condemned thousands (mostly women) to the stake, and the
consequences of the New Philosophy proposed by thinkers such as Rene
Descartes. Next, the course will focus on the economic foundations of
modernization. We will chronicle Spain's conquest and colonization of the New
World, chart the expansion of the Dutch commercial empire, and investigate the
origins of modern capitalism (and its political consequences) in England.
Finally, we will trace the development in France of a centralized modern state
that seemingly epitomizes the emerging "Age of Reason."

**Reading Assignments** : Readings on the subject of a given lecture or

when class discussions are scheduled. Because the secondary readings are
designed to provide you with background information, we will not necessarily
cover in class everything contained in the readings. If you do not understand
a point made in lecture, please feel free to raise your hand. If you wish to
discuss certain subjects at even greater length or are interested in other
treatments of a particular topic, I will be available after class or during
office hours.

and is worth 50% of your course grade.

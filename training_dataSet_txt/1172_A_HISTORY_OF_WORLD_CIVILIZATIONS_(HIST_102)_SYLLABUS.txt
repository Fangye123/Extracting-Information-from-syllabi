B. COURSE OBJECTIVES
1. To acquaint students with the main developments in the world's major
civilizations from the fifteenth century to the present. (Readings from
political, philosophical and religious writing will supplement the textbook
and provide practical examples of how some people have dealt with the perennial
problems facing humankind.)
2. To draw attention to the main characteristics of the major world
civilizations--in areas of culture such as art, philosophy, religion,
government--and the factors that contributed to their uniqueness.
3. To address some of the perennial questions humankind has asked and
analyze the implications of the answers to these questions.
4. To acquaint students with the way historians work, the importance
of the methodologies used, how these methodologies are similar to and different
from other disciplines in the social sciences, and the ways in which the
telling or writing of history is affected by the approaches and methods
historians use. 
5. To develop the following skills: 

a. The ability to gather information efficiently and critically;
b. The ability to think critically about what is heard or read;
c. The ability to form judgments which are consistent with the evidence;
d. The ability to communicate, in spoken and written form, those judgments
clearly and cogently.

C. METHODS
1. Lectures and/or discussions, normally four times a week.
2. Reading and note-making by the student: Lectures are guides to, rather
than exhaustive analyses of, a topic. Wide and intelligent reading is necessary
if the student is to be well-informed. 
3. Tests and Quizzes: These will give students an opportunity to see
how well they are meeting the course objectives. 
4. Essays: These will allow the student to analyze and discuss specific
topics or questions in a more detailed manner. 
5. Final examination: A final demonstration of the student's progress.
D. REQUIREMENTS
1. Reading: You should aim to spend at least three hours each day reading,
making notes and preparing for the appropriate assignments.
2. Quizzes: these may be given at the beggining of any class (worth 25% of the grade).
3. Essays: six times during the course 'problems' in history based
on primary texts as well as from the books Sources of World History and
Discovering the Global Past will be discussed in class.  Essays will be set
based on the class discussion and the readings. (These essays are worth 20% of the grade.)
4. Tests: lasting one hour on August 1 & 13 (worth 20%
of the grade).
5. Final Examination: Thursday, August 16, 8:00-10:00.

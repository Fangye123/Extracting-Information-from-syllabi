_description_  
    
    
    
    


  | this is a graduate-level introduction to computer-mediated communication
(cmc).  cmc is communication between people using applications such as email,
newsgroups, chat, muds, and 3d virtual worlds.  this course is concerned with
the design and implementation of such applications and the analysis of cmc
practices and social formations that emerge when people use these
applications.  topics include aesthetic, ethical, artistic, architectural, and
computational criteria for the design and implementation of cmc systems; and
the social, political, linguistic, historical, and philosophical analysis of
existing and emerging cmc.  online communities will be our focus this term.

  | students will be required to

(1) _produce a final project_ : students can choose to work in groups or to
work alone.  the project can be to either (a) implement a new cmc system; or,
(b) analyze how people use an existing cmc system.  students looking for or
currently pursuing a thesis topic will be enouraged to use the course as a
means to further the thesis work. a project proposal will be due early in the
semester and an interium report will due midway through the term.  those who
choose to implement a new cmc system will be required to write a short (<=5
page) paper; document the code written for the project; and give a ten minute
oral presentation at the end of the term.  those who choose to analyze an
existing cmc system will be asked to write a journal-length paper (20-30
pages); and give a ten minute oral presentation at the end of the term.  in
the project proposals, students will identify a potential conference or
journal that will determine the style and content of the final project paper.
project proposal should also contain a list of references identifying existing
related work.

(2) _summarize and elaborate on three of the required readings_ : students
will choose three of the required readings.  For each chosen reading, the
student will compose a one page summary.  in addition to the summary, the
student will identify and list three books, articles, websites, or code
archives that constitute related work.  for each of these related works, the
student will compose a one or two sentence description of the work.  students
will upload their summaries to the course website so that all class members
will be able to read them.  students who summarize a reading will be required
to give an oral account of their summary in class during the discussion of the
reading.

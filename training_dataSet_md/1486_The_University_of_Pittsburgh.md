Our vast land is great and rich but there is no order here. Come along and
rule over us.  
(Primary Chronicle)

With the mind alone Russia cannot be understood,  
No ordinary yardstick spans her greatness:  
She stands alone, unique -  
In Russia one can only believe.  
(Fedor Tiutchev)

### I. Course Description

This is a guided tour through Russian medieval and early 18th-century culture.
My aim is to demonstrate the dramatic changes in the history of Russia's
national idea, the richness and variety of Russian culture of the discussed
period and its crucial importance for the development of modern Russian
culture. We will focus our attention on three successive eras of Russia's
cultural history -- Kievan Rus' (9-13 c.), the Muscovite Tsardom (13-17 c.),
and the rise of the Russian Empire, centered on St. Petersburg (18 c.). The
class will examine such artifacts as icons, architecture, sculpture,
literature, and painting, as well as some basic theological, political, and
aesthetic theories. Reading assignments will draw from historical (MacKenzie,
Curran), art history (Hamilton), and literary (Zenkovsky) sources. Class
lectures will be supplemented by frequent slide, video, and musical
presentations.

### II. Course Methodology

Class consists of lecture, discussion, occasional quizzes, and two in-class,
closed-book exams. The introduction of each section of the course will place
the works of art under investigation in their actual historical and cultural
context.

### III. Required Texts and Materials

  * Hamilton, George Heard. _The Art and Architecture of Russia._ 3rd ed. New Haven: Yale UP, 1983.
  * MacKenzie, David and Michael W. Curran. _A History of Russia, the Soviet Union, and Beyond._ 5th ed. Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 1993
  * Zenkovsky, Serge A., ed. _Medieval Russia's Epics, Chronicles, Tales_. Rev. ed. NY: Dutton, 1974.

### IV. Suggested Reading

  * Billington, James. _The Icon and the Axe: An Interpretative History of Russian Culture._ NY: Random House, 1970
  * Rzhevsky, Nicholas. _An Anthology of Russian Literature_ , any edition.

**NB!!! Required three-ring hole punch and three-ring binder for handouts.**

### V. Course Requirements

  1. Attendance (see #6) and class participation. More than three unexcused absences will reduce your grade dramatically \-- no exceptions!
  2. Midterm and final examinations will include two parts each: 
    1. identifications: what's The Time of Troubles?
    2. a short essay on a topic previously given in class

The Midterm Exam will be in class on Thursday, October 25. The Final Exam must
be taken at the time scheduled by the Registrar in order to receive credit for
this course.

### VI. Attendance Policy and Class Participation

Attendance and participation in class discussion are required, and are
incorporated into the course grade in the following ways:

  1. Attendance counts for 10% of your grade. Since there are 28 class meetings (twice a week for fourteen weeks), every absence reduces the attendance portion of your grade by 1/28.
  2. Participation counts for 10% of your grade. To earn an A for class participation, students are expected to participate meaningfully in class discussion at least 1/3 of the time (9-10 times during the semester). Absence means that you are unable to earn participation credit on that day.
  3. To makeup examinations or quizzes will be given unless documentation of a medical emergence is provided the day the student returns to class. Unexcused absence on the day of examination or quiz is given results in no credit for that examination or quiz.
  4. **Much of the material covered in this course (and incorporated into examinations and quizzes) is introduced in lecture and through classroom discussion. Absence means a loss of access to this material, which likely averse consequences on examinations and quizzes. Students are responsible for obtaining notes from their classmate about sessions they may miss due to absence.**

### VII. Evaluation

Attendance: 10%  
Participation: 10%  
Quizzes: 25%  
Midterm Exam: 25%  
Final Exam: 30%

### VIII. Academic Integrity

university policy of academic integrity and for adhering to it. The rules are
spelled out in the University's Academic Integrity _Policies_ (Policy

**Description**

This is the second of two courses in a series designed to provide an
introduction to African civilization. While the first in the series looked
essentially at precolonial Africa, this course picks up from the conquest of
Africa leading to colonial rule starting at the end of the last century, and
the resistance to this conquest. It examines the economic, political, social
and psychological ramifications of colonial rule in the first half of the
twentieth century. The movement towards independence and the emergence of new
nations by 1960 would lead us into some of the current problems of Africa -
economic decline, military rule, drought and desertification, urbanization and
gender issues.

**Readings**

Afigbo, Ayandele, Gavin, Omer-Cooper, Palmer, _The Making of Modern Africa,

**Requirements**

Attendance at class sessions is mandatory. More than five absences from the
lectures will result in a loss of the ten percent allocated for attendance.

The components of the final grade include:

  1. One multiple choice test after the first two weeks. There will be no make-up for this test. 
  2. One mid term essay test. Two questions will be given out a week in advance and one of these will be selected a week later to be written in class. Missing the mid term automatically disqualifies the student from getting an `A' for that test. The Instructor will have to be notified of failure to take the test not later than a week after the test is administered. If an excuse provided is found acceptable, a make up test will earn the student a lower grade. 
  3. A final multiple choice test and two short answer essays will constitute the last piece of work Recitation work, comprising ten percent of the final grades, will include an essay on the novel _A Man of the People_ , and some map quiz work. 

Grades will be computed as follows:

    
    
        First multiple choice              15%

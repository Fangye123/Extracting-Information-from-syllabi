In this course we examine the economic, social and political forces which
condition cultural production and reproduction. Initially we establish a
theoretical framework by focusing on the ways in which social class, race,
gender, nation, and the international order contribute to the formation of
culture. Next we study specific cases in Central America, Europe, the  
United States, and Mexico.

Required books should be on sale in the UMBC Bookstore. All other texts will
be available in xerox copies on reserve in the MMC. Students should make
personal copies of all the xeroxed articles since we will be referring to them
in class.

**MLL 603 "notebook"**: During the first part of this course a somewhat wide  
range of complex theoretical concepts will be introduced. These concepts  
will then be recycled in two ways: 1. The exam will require that you be  
able to summarize and apply them; 2. For the final paper you will need to  
select appropriate concepts as the theoretical framework. Therefore you  
will need to keep a notebook in which you summarize and explain these  
concepts to yourself in your own words (vs. stand-alone quotes). You will  
occasionally be required to hand in a copy of your summary. The  
instructors will review the summaries but will not grade them. Therefore,  
we recommend you do the summaries in a computer file, a convenient means of  
recording and reviewing your ideas, and of producing copies. You would,  
then, have 2 "notebooks" for this class, a paper notebook for class notes  
and a computer file.

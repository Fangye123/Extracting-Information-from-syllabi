**CONSTITUTIONAL LAW I**  
**Winter Semester 2002**  
**Course Syllabus**

**There is no required casebook.   Recommended references for the course are
_American Constitutional Law_ by Tribe (2nd Edition--not 3rd, which will split
material into two books!) and _Constitutional Law_ (6th Edition) by Nowak and
Rotunda.   The Tribe book is the more provocative and interesting of the two
sources, but somewhat dated.  Nowak's and Rotunda's book is a traditional
hornbook in the West series.**

**I. INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY OF THE CONSTIUTION**

**TOPIC 1: The Nature and Structure of the Constitution**

**Our first discussion will be based on the page, "[INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY
OF CONSTITUTIONAL
LAW](http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/conlawintro.htm)."
Read the
[Constitution](http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/constitution.html).
Identify those provisions, if any, that confer power on: (1) the federal
government, (2) the states, and (3) private individuals.  Identify those
provisions, if any, that limit the power of: (1) the federal government, (2)
the states, and (3) private individuals.  Are there provisions that seem to
have little to do with issues of power?  What are the purposes of the
provisions unrelated to power allocation?  Based on the text and structure of
the Constitution, what seem to be its primary purposes?**

**TOPIC 2: The Constitutional Convention of 1787**

**Read   "A More Perfect Union: The Creation of the U. S. Constitution" at the
National Archves website.  The account can be accessed by clicking on
"[HISTORY](http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/history.html)"
and then going to the appropriate link. You should also spend some time
exploring the other links posted on the History page. Be ready to discuss the
following questions: Why was a Constitutional Convention necessary? Who were
the delegates?  What sorts of interests did they represent?  What were some of
the critical compromises reached in Philadelphia?  What major issues were left
unresolved?**

**TOPIC 3: Ratification of the Constitution and the Origins of the Bill of
Rights**

> **Read materials on
the[HISTORY](http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/history.html)
page relating to the ratification of the Constitution and the adoption of the
Bill of Rights.  What were the principal objections of the Anti-Federalists to
the Constitution?  How were those objections countered? Compare Madison's
original proposal for a Bill of Rights with the amendments actually adopted.
Examine the debates in the House and Senate concerning the proposed Bill of
Rights.  What were the principal arguments for and against adoption of the
Bill of Rights?** ****

### Research

> **The Data Archive**  
>  [ http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/](http://dawww.essex.ac.uk/)  
>  The University of Essex hosts "the largest collection of accessible
computer-readable data in the social sciences and humanities in the United
Kingdom," housing over 7000 datasets of information for secondary research in
a variety of disciplines. Users can search the catalog and indexes by subject
or keyword using the BIRON (Information Retrieval On-line) system or its
associated thesarus, HASSET (Humanities And Social Science Electronic
Thesaurus). Bibliographic information returned is comprehensive. The site also
features links to a number of other archives and social science information
services, including the CESSDA Integrated Data Catalog, "a unified collection
of mainly European social science data archive catalogues, which can be
searched through one common interface." Authorized users (conditions vary by
dataset) can order data in a variety of formats and media. [MD]

> **Cambridge University Press Journals Online**  
>  [
http://www.journals.cup.org/cup/html/nm_intro.htm](http://www.journals.cup.org/cup/html/nm_intro.htm)  
>  Cambridge University Press (CUP) has unveiled a new free service that gives
users full access to its online journals. After registration, users can browse
the content of all Cambridge online journals, read abstracts, download the
full text in PDF format, and sign up for an alerting service. CUP plans to
make at least 50 titles available by the end of 1997. At present there are
several titles of interest to social scientists, including _Journal of
American Studies_ , _The Journal of African History_ , _Journal of Latin
American Studies_ , and _Journal of Social Policy_. Please note that free
access to full text articles will cease at an unspecified date in late 1997.
However, tables of contents, abstracts and search facilities will remain free
to all. [MD]

kiel.de:8080/ORIENTALISTIK/easl/easl.html)  
>  This site is an excellent collection of resources for both librarians and
scholars interested in China. Highlights include recent and past issues of
BEASL (Bulletin of the European Association of Sinological Librarians), notes
from European China Library Groups, and an annotated list of selected European
Sinological Libraries which includes information on holdings, focus,
communication, and some hyperlinks. The site also offers telnet access to the
catalogue of the Sinological Series in European Libraries Project (SSLEP). Two
large collections of links are also featured: the first to libraries and East
Asian Library Associations worldwide, the second to a wide variety of general
and specific Asian resources. [MD]

>  [
http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/workpap.htm](http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/cde/workpap.htm)  
>  The CDE at the University of Wisconsin-Madison is "a multi-disciplinary
faculty research cooperative for social scientific demographic research whose
membership includes sociologists, rural sociologists, economists, and
historians." CDE research focuses "on population composition and distribution
within the United States, especially on changes in family structure and
process and social inequality, but the total range of research and training
activities of CDE members is far broader in content and scope." This page
features two working paper series: CDE papers and National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH) papers. Selected papers (Adobe Acrobat [.pdf] and
PostScript) are avialable online, but ordering information is provided and
available abstracts may be viewed without special software. [MD]

>  [ http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/proj/ejab/](http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/proj/ejab/)  
>  Provided by John Howell, International Studies Bibliographer at the
University of Iowa Libraries, "EJAB is a refereed online journal of
bibliographies on any aspect of Africa, its peoples, their homes, cities,
towns, districts, states, countries, regions, including social, economic
sustainable development, creative literature, the arts, and the Diaspora." The
site currently has three bibliographies: Guides, Collections and Ancillary
Materials to African Archival Resources in the US; Foreign Periodicals on
Africa; and Medical/Health Periodicals and Books on Africa. Combined, they
contain over 2100 entries. Anyone studying Africa will undoubtedly find
numerous important resources. [MD]

### Learning Resources

> **CAIN Web Service--The Northern Ireland Conflict**  
>  [ http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html](http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/index.html)  
>  The CAIN Project (Conflict Archive on the Internet) is in the process of
creating a wonderful multimedia resource for anyone researching or teaching
"the Troubles." The site is still under development, but the amount of
information already offered is well worth a visit. Sections currently
available include Background to the Conflict, Key Issues, Key Events, and
Bibliographic Databases. Sections on Northern Ireland Society, Conflict
Studies, and a Directory of Researchers are under development. Users may
conduct both full text page and bibliographic searches of the entire site.
Although the Key Issues and Events sections will eventually be the largest,
the Background area currently has the most content. Among its offerings are a
glossary and thesaurus of relevant terms, acronyms of prominent organizations,
a bibliography and chronology of the conflict, a guide to research data,
related links, and a photo collection which includes political wall murals.

> **The Valley of the Shadow Archive: Two Communities in the American Civil
War**  
>  [
http://jefferson.village.Virginia.EDU/vshadow2/](http://jefferson.village.Virginia.EDU/vshadow2/)  
>  This ambitious and well-executed web site is the product of a University of
Virginia research Project funded in part by the National Endowment for the
Humanities. It seeks to document the story of the Civil War as seen by the
people of two communities in the Great Valley of the United States which were
separated by only a few hundred miles: Franklin County, Pennsylvania and
Augusta County, Virginia. Users can take a walking tour of the archive or
search its rooms, which include Public Records, Newspapers, Letters and
Diaries, Church Records, Military Records, or Maps and Images. Collectively,
they contain an amazing amount of primary source material. The site also
features a Reference Center, which includes a bibliography, tools for using
the archive, and examples from teachers who have used the project in the
classroom. In addition, this site, which focuses on the period between John
Brown's Raid in October 1859 and the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861,
is only the first of three planned installments. The project plans to document
life in these counties through Emancipation and Reconstruction. [MD]

>  [
http://www.truman.edu/academics/ss/faculty/tamakoshil/index.html](http://www.truman.edu/academics/ss/faculty/tamakoshil/index.html)  
>  This site is part of an effort by Professor Laura Tamakoshi of Truman State
University to deepen her student's understanding and appreciation of fieldwork
in anthropology. The content is based on Dr. Tamakoshi's five and one-half
years of research in Papua New Guinea, but her experiences and advice can be
applied to any region. The site is divided into four major sections, Planning,
Method, Writing, and Reference, which address such topics as writing
proposals, choosing field sites, setting up, adjusting to culture shock, and
writing field notes and reports. The Reference section also contains a
bibliography and a short list of links. This site is especially useful for
Anthropology graduate students planning their research, but anyone with an
interest in the field or in Papua New Guinea will find the site interesting
and engaging. [MD]

> **International Constitutional Law**  
>  [ http://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/law/home.html](http://www.uni-
wuerzburg.de/law/home.html)  
>  Hosted by the University of Wuerzburg (Germany), International
Constitutional Law (ICL) provides English texts of constitutional documents
and links to background information on over seventy countries. Documents are
cross-referenced for comparison of constitutional provisions. Also featured
are links to Constitutional Court sites, a Model Constitutional Code, a
section on German Case Law, a comprehensive list of international
organizations, and a strong collection of links to constitutional and
international law and constitution sites. The material available at ICL is
widely applicable to fields such as political science, international
relations, or government, and could be very useful for research projects in
both secondary and university classrooms. [MD]

>  This site is produced by Syllabus Press, publishers of the free _Syllabus
Magazine_ , which covers the use of technology in secondary and higher
education. Syllabus Web features full text archives of several of the
company's publications and an index of case studies on technology innovation
in classrooms. The site also has four sections which are updated weekly: Job
Listings, Case Studies, News/Resources/Trends, and Higher Education Web Site.
Additional content includes detailed information on the annual Syllabus
Conference and reviews of the latest educational technology products. [MD]

### Professional and General Interest

> **Conference Announcements**  
>  IRISS'98 Internet Research and Information for Social Scientists  
>  [ http://www.sosig.ac.uk/iriss/](http://www.sosig.ac.uk/iriss/)  
>  March 25-27, 1998 University of Bristol, UK. The first international IRISS
conference aims to bring together social scentists who are interested in the
Internet, either as a means of supporting and enhancing their work, or as a
focus for their research. IRISS is aimed at people working in the social
sciences and they invite papers and participation from practitioners,
researchers, librarians, educators, and information providers. [MD]

> "Globalization From Below: Contingency and Contestation in Historical
Perspective"  
>  [
http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/global/](http://jefferson.village.virginia.edu/~spoons/global/)  
>  February 5-8, 1998 Duke University, Durham, North Carolina, USA. "This
conference is concerned with globalization as a dynamic, contested and often
contingent process. Rather than concentrating upon the huge, apparently
irresistible structures that have shaped our world in the last 500 years, we
will look rather at how different people and groups in specific situations and
places have struggled to come to terms with, and often conduct resistance
against, the developing global system."

"prosecute persons responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since
1991." This site was recently established to provide information on the
Tribunal's proceedings. Users can view the latest documents and news, press
releases, and lists of detainees and indictments. Other features at this site
include Tribunal Publications, Basic Legal Documents, Tribunal cases, the ICTY
_Bulletin_ , and links to information on the Dayton Peace Agreement. Quick

>  [ http://finaid.org/](http://finaid.org/)  
>  Maintained by Mark Kantrowitz and sponsored by the National Association of
Student Financial Aid Administrators (NASFAA), the Financial Aid Information
Page is one of the finest online sources of free information and guidance on
student financial aid. The site is divided into categories which address
various aspects of finding and securing aid. The Assistance section includes
an overview of financial aid, a glossary, a bibliography, and scam alerts.
Under Tools users will find Kantrowitz's financial aid calculators, which help
students and their parents better plan their financial futures. The core of
the site is the collection of links to databases of aid sources, lists of
lenders and loan guarantors, government information, and links to major
scholarship and fellowship sources such as FastWEB, SRN Express, and ExPAN.
FinAid is an excellent place for students at any level to begin their
electronic search for funding. [MD]

>  On 11 September the Scottish people voted strongly in favor of creating
their own Parliament and granting that body tax varying powers. One week
later, Wales approved its first devolved government in over 500 years by the
narrowest of margins (0.6%). The first site is the official devolution site by
the office of the Secretary of State for Scotland. It includes the full text
of the White Paper, an explanation of the main elements of the Government's
proposals, the full text of the Referendum Act and its results by region. The
second site is put up by Scotland's largest-selling newspapers, the Daily
Record and Sunday Mail, which strongly supported the initiative. Their site
has a number of items of interest, including the latest devolution news, a
chat room, a resource guide, and a history of the fight for Scottish home
rule. A Voice for Wales is the official devolution site of the Secretary of
State for Wales. It features full text press releases and the White Paper on
Welsh devolution. The site is also available in Welsh. Naturally, the Scottish
National Party and Plaid Cymru (the Welsh nationalist party) strongly backed
both initiatives. Their sites offer profiles of party leaders, party
manifestos and white papers, and the latest news. [MD]

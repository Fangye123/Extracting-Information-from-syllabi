1492: An Ongoing Voyage  
<http://metalab.unc.edu/expo/1492.exhibit/Intro.html> **< NB**  
This online exhibit was organized by the Library of Congress.  "1492\.
Columbus. The date and the name provoke many questions related to the linking
of very different parts of the world, the Western Hemisphere and the
Mediterranean. What was life like in those areas before 1492? What spurred
European expansion? How did European, African and American peoples react to
each other? What were some of the immediate results of these contacts? The
exhibition examines the first sustained contacts between American people and
European explorers, conquerors and settlers from 1492 to 1600. During this
period, in the wake of Columbus's voyages, Africans also arrived in the
hemisphere, usually as slaves. All of these encounters, some brutal and
traumatic, others more gradual, irreversibly changed the way in which peoples
in the Americas led their lives." The exhibit is divided into six sections:
What Came To Be Called "America"; The Mediterranean World; Christopher
Columbus: Man and Myth; Inventing America; Europe Claims America; Epilogue.

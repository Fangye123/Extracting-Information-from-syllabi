####  Course Objectives

This course is designed to provide a solid foundation and background in the
active research field of distributed systems. In particular, this course will
help you:

  * Attain a clear understanding of the goals and issues present in distributed systems design. 
  * Understand the characteristics and important contributions of existing and past distributed systems, both research and commercial. 
  * Become familiar with current distributed systems programming paradigms, such as shared memory, message passing, and object-based systems. This will be accomplished partly through class programming projects. 
  * Learn to read research papers efficiently and effectively, and to distill the most important contributions of the papers you read. 
  * Achieve the background that is necessary for conducting independent research, at the level of a masters or PhD thesis, in the field of distributed systems. 
I will do my best to make this course challenging, interesting, and fun.

####  Course Topics

**I FOUNDATIONS**

* Design goals 
* Communication and network protocols (TCP/IP) 
* Remote procedure call (RPC) 
* Distributed synchronization, logical clocks, and concurrency control 
* Multicast and group communication (ISIS protocols) 
* Distributed atomic transactions 
* Distributed deadlock detection 
* Distributed mutual exclusion 

**II SYSTEM COMPONENTS**

* Programming models and paradigms 
* Distributed shared memory 
* Fault tolerance, robustness, and reliability 
* Scheduling, load balancing, load sharing, and process migration 
* Protection, authentication, and security 
* Distributed file systems (NFS, Andrew/Coda) 

**III ADVANCED TOPICS**

* Distributed operating systems 
* Current object based systems (CORBA, DCOM, Legion) 
* Metasystems and grid computing (Globus, Legion)

####  Lecture Notes

Lecture slides and/or notes (generally in Powerpoint format) will be available
via the course web page. Lecture notes are not a substitute for class
attendance, since (i) they will not be complete and (ii) significant parts of
lectures may not come from the class notes.

####  Reading

There will be no required textbook for the course material presented in class.
We will be studying research papers from the literature, many or most of which
will be available on line on the course reading page at
[http://www.cs.binghamton.edu/~mlewis/CS654/cs654-reading.html](cs654-reading.html).
The university has access to the ACM online digital library at
<http://www.acm.org/dl>, which contains full-text for many of the articles we
will be using. Some reading materials that are not available on line will have
to be put on reserve in the Bartle Library Reserve Room for you to photocopy
or read there. The reserve reading area is in Room 1302 of the North part of
the main university library (just above the campus bookstore).

#### Programming Projects

_Lab_ : We will be using the Unix machines on the first floor of the
Engineering building ("South Pod").

More on the programming project to come soon.

#### Homework Assignments

There will be several homework assignments which may include problem solving,
and/or a writing component. Please print your homework on a printer
(handwritten assignments are strongly discouraged), and _keep an electronic
copy of your homework until the semester is complete_. The final homework
assignment will involve a class presentation on topic of recent interest in
distributed systems research.

#### Exams

The first two exams will be held during the normal class time, for the full
time period.

The last exam, held during finals week, will concentrate almost exclusively on
the new material covered since the second exam, but may cover some of the most
important concepts from the earlier parts of the semester. The date for the
third exam will be during exams week; as far as I know the date has not been
set yet.

Material for exams may be taken from all assigned readings (unless otherwise
stated) and from lectures (including but not limited to what is actually
printed on the lecture notes).

All three exams are closed notes, closed books.

####  Prerequisites and Background

There are no official prerequisite courses for this class. A graduate level
operating systems course is encouraged, but not required.

Experience programming in C for Unix will also be very helpful, but is not
strictly necessary. However, you are expected to learn, on your own, the
skills you need to complete the programming assignments; we will not be
covering that material during class time.

####  Office Hours and Help

Please always feel free to:

* visit me during my designated office hours 
* set up a special appointment outside of office hours (especially if the hours are not convenient for your schedule) 
* talk to me briefly just before or just after class, and 
* contact me by email 

Because of the size of the class, I must request that you please _do not_ make
a habit of

* "dropping by" my office unannounced outside of designated office hours, or 
* calling on the phone 

I will likely extend office hours in the days leading up to exams and
assignment due dates, if necessary.

#### Late Assignments

Extensions on homeworks and programming assignments will _rarely_ be granted,
especially not when requested at the last minute. Unless otherwise noted,
assignments are due _in class_ at 2:50pm, _not_ at 2:55pm or after class.

#### Collaboration

All homework and programming assignments must be completed _individually_ ,
unless I indicate otherwise (you will work in teams for all but the first
programming project). You are free to discuss assignments with one another.
However, each of you must write your own code, and you must write up all
solutions individually; please do not show your work directly to other
students, and do not look at other students' code or homework. Students
submitting solutions that I decide are "too similar", will be punished equally
and harshly. Learn from, teach, and help one another, but do not give or
receive answers.

#### Grade Changes and Complaints

All requests for changes of grades must be made _in writing_ , not in person.
Resubmit your homework or exam to Sameer or me (depending on who grades the
work), along with a _separate written statement_ describing why you feel you
deserve more points, and the TA and I will consider your case.

We had the dream and we are losing it. . . . To create a society in which each
man has the opportunity to love himself and thereby, the opportunity to love
his fellows. That is the dream. . . . Now, because the problems facing us are
more complex than we ever imagined, maintaining the dream is that much more
difficult.

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

**_What is this course?_** This course examines the origins, development, and
ongoing legacy of a pivotal period in U.S. history: the 1960s. The course will
assume that to begin to adequately understand this period, the 1960s should
not be taken literally; elements of the 1950s and the 1970s will also be
considered as they relate to the significance of the 1960s.

**_What will class meetings be like?_** The course will meet three times a
week. In general, lecture and discussion will constitute the main portion of
most classes each week. Often, parts of classes will be devoted to the
preparation and/or presentation of assignments or the viewing of a video.

**_What will be expected in general of each student?_** The workload of the
course reflects both liberal arts expectations in general and historical
method in particular. **Attendance** at all class meetings is, of course,
expected. Some 1200 pp. of **reading** will be required. **Writing** will
include an in-class midterm and final, a 6-8 pp. analysis of an oral
interview, and brief assignments on the reading. **Discussion** time will be a
regular part of class, and **** an **oral interview** will form the basis of
the one required paper.

* * *

**COURSE OBJECTIVES (WHAT DIFFERENCE THIS COURSE SHOULD MAKE):**

  1. Gain familiarity with the significant U.S. historical developments centered in the 1960s, since this period has arguably shaped contemporary society and culture in ways that are still being weighed.
  2. Exercise and develop skills in analytical reading, critical thinking and writing, oral interviewing, and oral discussion through course assignments and activities, since such liberal arts/ historical method skills are key tools for learning how, with the Apostle Paul, to "take every thought captive to obey Christ" (2 Cor. 10:5).
  3. Practice thinking about a basic understanding of the significance of the 1960s in the U.S. in light of a Christian perspective on faith and life, since "in [Christ] all things hold together" (Col. 1:17).

**_B. A WRITTEN ANALYSIS of an ORAL INTERVIEW will constitute 40% of the
course grade._**

**_B.1._** _THE SELECTION OF, PREPARATION FOR, & INTERVIEW OF AN INTERVIEWEE
will constitute 5% of the course grade._

  1. Each student is to _select an individual_ who remembers  "the Sixties" as a distinct era in her or his own life and who is willing to be interviewed. This person could be a personal relative, the relative of a friend, a NWC faculty or staff member, an employer or supervisor, a pastor, etc. (See the [List of NWC Community Members Potentially Interviewable](sixtieslinks.htm).) The interviewee should be assured that the goal of the interview is for the interviewer to come to understand the interviewee's experience of the Sixties in historical context.
  2. The interviewee must explicitly agree both to be interviewed and to allow the interview to be used for this written assignment. Each student should print out a copy of the Oral Interview Release Form from the [Course Links](sixtieslinks.htm) webpage. Each student should have their interviewee sign the Release Form before or at the time of the interview. Once signed, the release form should be turned in to the instructor. _The failure to turn in a properly explained and signed Release Form will invalidate the final paper._
  3. _By no later than Mon., Apr. 2, an Interview Plan is due_ in class from each student. In 1 p., typed, with your name and RSC box # on the plan, the Interview Plan should indicate a) when the interview will be done, b) who has agreed to be interviewed by the student, c) why this particular interviewee has been selected, and d) a set of several topics or questions that are planned to be raised during the interview.
  4. The _interview should be completed before Wed., Apr. 18_ , (by the end of the Easter Break) so that the student has time to assess the material for the final written paper.
  5. On interviewing, see the guide on the [Course Links](sixtieslinks.htm) page. _The interview itself should be scheduled for an hour_ , although going longer than this is acceptable if the interviewee is willing. While it is best to do interviews face to face, phone interviews are acceptable if necessary. E-mail interviews are NOT acceptable. The interview may be taped, if the interviewee agrees and if the interviewer deems this to be helpful, but taping is not necessary. Careful listening, taking a few notes during the interview, and then taking time as soon after the interview as possible to write down further notes on the interview, should suffice. A _follow-up_ phone call, e-mail, or meeting is encouraged to clarify details and raise any further questions. _A copy of any notes, transcript, or tape of the interview should be given to the instructor with the written analysis._
  6. The _evaluation_ of this part of the assignment will be by a) assessing the quality of thought and preparation evidenced in the Interview Plan, b) noting whether an Interview Release Form has been handed in and properly signed, and c) assessing the adequacy of the questioning, listening, and note-taking evidenced in the notes of the interview that are turned in.

**_B.2._** _A WRITTEN ANALYSIS PLACING THE INTERVIEWEE'S EXPERIENCE IN THE
LARGER HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF THE SIXTIES will constitute 35% of the course
grade._

  1. _The written analysis should seek to set the interviewee's experiences and reflections in historical context._ The paper should not be a summary of the interview. Rather, it should draw on the course material in general and, when relevant, in particulars, to illumine the historical experiences of the interviewee, or, in other words, to connect the interviewee's experiences to the context of  "Sixties" developments, states of affairs, events, movements, values, assumptions, popular culture, and other relevant aspects of U.S. society and culture. _What does the interviewee's experience help us understand about the Sixties?_
  2. In addition to the interview itself, the _course reading will be expected to be significantly reflected in written analysis._
  3. On the one hand, this is not a research paper. The interview and the course reading are the only required materials. On the other hand, using reference works, checking online, and/or otherwise corroborating important aspects of the interview adds to the quality of the final product _._ For example, if the interviewee was influenced by rock music, then going beyond the assigned course reading on music would be relevant. Or, if participation in the Vietnam War was significant for the interviewee, then more background material on the war would be relevant.
  4. The final written product should be _typed double spaced and consist of 6-8 pp. plus a title page, foot- or endnotes, and a bibliography containing all sources consulted (whether quoted from or not)_. The form for the notes and bibliography are the traditional Chicago/Turabian style used by historians. Consult the examples online through the [Course Links](sixtieslinks.htm).
  5. _Two copies_ of the written analysis are _due in class Mon., Apr. 30_.
  6. The _most important factors for evaluation_ of the written analysis include 1) how completely and well (if relevant) are the above specifications met? 2) how well are course materials and any outside corroborative or supplemental research used in configuring the interview with the larger historical elements of the Sixties? and 3) how lucid and cogent is the analysis?

**_C. CLASS PARTICIPATION will constitute 10% of the course grade_** _._

  1. DAs are "informal" writing assignments, i.e., small-scale writing evaluated in a more relaxed, less intense ("informal") manner. They are given to encourage student engagement with particular reading assignments or issues. Compared to the "formal" writing assignments (i.e., the biographical research paper, the reports, and the take-home essay), each DA is minor. However, each is intended as a "low risk" opportunity for the development of student skills in reading, thinking, and writing. If done consistently and attentively, the DAs should be the easiest part of the course grade;
  2. an as-yet-to-be-determined number of DAs will be given. Sometimes they will be given one class ahead of when they are due; sometimes they will be given in class for completion during that class;
  3. DAs handed in late (i.e., after collection) are subject to penalty, unless the student has cleared with the instructor legitimate reasons for handing in the DA late;
  4. DAs may be handwritten, but they must be legible and clearly labeled with the student's name, DA#, due date, and RSC box # at the head of each DA;
  5. each DA is worth 3 points, unless specified otherwise: 1 for neatness and other issues of form and 2 for substantive content;
  6. the instructor's student assistant will grade the DAs.

**_D._** _CLASS PARTICIPATION_

  1. Class participation per se will be a factor used in determining whether to give any benefit of the doubt to students when considering both evaluation of particular assignments and the overall course grade.
  2. Participation in class consists of at the least the following: regularity of attendance; consistency of preparation for class; attentiveness in class (including taking notes, on discussions and visual and aural media as well as lectures); and engagement in class discussion (engagement is not limited to verbal participation; one can be engaged in attentiveness, as measured by body language).

**COURSE MISCELLANY:**

  1. Students are responsible for contacting the instructor about UNAVOIDABLE ABSENCES. Students are also responsible for obtaining from others in the class what material is missed.
  2. The operative scale for each assignment and for the course as a whole is 100%, with 90+ the A range, 80-89 the B range, 70-79 the C range, 60-69 the D range, and below 60 the F range.

# Post-Romantic Music Before World War I

In some senses, the Romantic era in music never ended. Although many composers
reacted against the Romantic esthetic, others continued to write such music
throughout the 20th century. There was a pronounced backlash against these
composers in academic music circles from mid-century for about thirty years;
but various forms of "Neo-romanticism" have since restored the ideals of
melody, traditional harmonies, emotional expression, and narrative among many
younger composers. The result is that "contemporary" music by composers like
Philip Glass and Arvo Part is often is often more appealing to a broad
audience than earlier works by composers who claimed to be the authentic voice
of the 20th century in stressing dissonance and fragmentation in their music.
The late Washington State composer Alan Hovhaness benefitted from the turn
toward Neo-romanticism simply by continuing to do what he had done for over
seventy years: composing in a colorful expressive style. His works now enjoy a
popularity they lacked during most of his long life. Another Washington
contemporary composer of lovely works you might explore is Morton Lauridesen,
who was born in Colfax!

However, this course ends its survey of music at 1914, on the eve of World War
I. (Humanities 304, taught on the WSU campus in the spring, takes up the story
from there.) There are only two selections on your Naxos CD set from this
period, of which one is actually a Romantic work, so you will need to
supplement your listening by borrowing an appropriate CD or set from the list
below to do this assignment.

**Disc 2**

**Track 14: Debussy: Suite bergamasque: Clair de lune**

[Claude Debussy](http://www.eb.com:180/cgi-bin/g?DocF=micro/162/72.html)
(French 1862-1918) is usually considered the leading musical Impressionist.
"Impressionism" is a problematic term in music. It was borrowed from art
critics to describe the compositions of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel; but
music historians today are very uncomfortable in using the label for Ravel's
work at all and would consider only a small number of Debussy's compositions
to belong to the category. Those who market music, however, still lump the two
together under this label, so if you are shopping it is good to know how the
term is commonly used.

There are some similarities between Impressionist painting and Impressionist
music.

* Impressionist art often tries to capture fleeting moments in which a certain kind of light transforms the objects it shines on. It is more about color and light than it is about the actual objects being painted and tends increasingly toward abstraction. 
* Impressionist music often lacks the sort of strong forward drive characteristic of earlier music. Time seems suspended. The sense of key is sometimes highly ambiguous, and there is a preference for whole-tone keys which cannot provide the sense of resolution traditional in Classical and Romantic music. 

* Impressionist artists deliberately rejected the large historical and mythical subjects for simple, everyday ones like horse races, ballet dancers, gardens in bloom, working people enjoying Sunday in the park. Their techniques rejected ornateness and polish for sponteneity and naturalness. 
* Impressionist composers specialized in small-scale works using smaller, simpler orchestras than their predecessors and simpler, more transparent textures. 

* Impressionist painters were powerfully influenced by Japanese prints. 
* Impressionist composers were influenced by Asian scales. 

There are many exceptions to these statements. The relationship of
Impressionism to Romanticism is not entirely rebellious. For example,
Debussy's only opera, _Pell eas et Melisande_ (1902), can be regarded as a
reaction against the heavy, over-emphatic music of Wagner's operas; yet many
modern scholars see a logical link between the two, and Debussy much admired
the great Romantic. Many of the people who loved Debussy's opera when it was
first performed were fervent Wagnerites, like the famous novelist Marcel
Proust.

Whatever the exact definition of Impressionism may be, one other comparison is
clear: both artistic and musical Impressionism are very popular with a broad
public.

All that said, "Clair de lune" ("Moonlight") is not a particularly
Impressionist piece. There are Romantic works with a similar feel, but its
emphasis on delicacy is especially characteristic of Debussy. The melody is
based on a popular folk song. Note how light the harmonies are, with no huge,
crashing chords of the kind common in the music of Liszt, for instance. The
rippling figures starting at about 1:45 are supposed to suggest the shining of
moonlight on rippling water. Debussy was often inspired by art and artistic
ideas.

It is worth noting that there are many lesser composers often associated with
musical Impressionism including Frederick Delius (England), John Tomlinson
Griffes and Charles Martin Loeffler (U.S.). Some of the works by Italian
composer Ottorino Respighi also have an Impressionist feel to them.

**Track 15: Elgar: Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1**

Edward Elgar (English, 1857-1934) is an example of the sort of composer who
continued the Romantic tradition well into the 20th century. You have probably
marched down an aisle at some time to collect a diploma to the familiar,
majestic tune in the second section of this 1901 piece (starting at 2:00). You
are less likely to have heard the spirited theme which surrounds it on either
side, whose rhythm is much more dancelike. The title is borrowed from
Shakespeare's _Othello_ , as the protagonist bids farewell to all he has
loved, including his military career:

> Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,  
>  The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,  
>  The royal banner, and all quality,  
>  Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!  
>  _(Act 3, scene 3, lines 351-354)_  
>

Elgar's other most popular works are his _Enigma Variations_ (1896) and his
Violin Concerto (1910).

Because there is so little music in your CD set from this period, I am asking
you to check out at least one recording from the list below (or listen to an
equivalent recording you have obtained from elsewhere).

First, click on the CDM number of the recording you are interested from the
list below. This will connect you with its entry in Griffin, the WSU library
catalogue. Look under "STATUS" to see whether or not the disc is checked out.
If it says "ON SHELF," you're in luck; but if not, try another disc. Remember
that when you are in Griffin, you can always get back to this page by clicking
your "Back" button.

If you have a slow connection, you can also try using Griffin via Telnet.
[Here are some instructions](telgrif.html).

Second, To check out CD's from Washington State University Media Materials
Services, choose what you want below and then contact Extended Degree Library
Services at 1-800-435-5832 or email [edplib@wsu.edu](mailto:edplib@wsu.edu).
The CD's will be mailed to you first class and must be returned within two
weeks to avoid overdue fines. You can check out up to three discs or disc sets
(multiple discs with the same CDM number together in a box); but please avoid
checking out a lot from this list during the same period of time that everyone
else will be working on it.

Then read the liner notes that come with the CD and listen to the music. Your
assignment is to describe one or two things that are described in the notes
and that you can hear in the music. You need not use technical terms, and you
must not copy the notes; just tell in your own words what you think you hear
that the notes of have described. If the notes don't help you, try to describe
some feature of the music that you can hear without their help. Then add your
own personal reaction to the music. This assignment is to be 50-100 words long
(longer if you wish).

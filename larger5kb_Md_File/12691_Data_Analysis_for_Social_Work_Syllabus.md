SW 3120: Data Analysis for Social Work Practice

### Syllabus  
Fall, 2002

### [John Sanborn](http://www.mtsu.edu/~jsanborn), Peck Hall 356

  
**Course Description**

Three credits. Prerequisites: SW 3110. Introduction to data analysis and
interpretation. Opportunities for skill development in the use of statistical
procedures and knowledge of the meaning of the results of such procedures.
Instruction in computer use for data entry and data analysis, including the
development of programing skills using the SPSS software package.  
  
This course provides an introduction to data analysis and interpretation as
used in professional social work practice. It includes an orientation to value
issues that relate to the use of statistical procedures and data presentation
in practice settings, including an understanding that data selection,
analysis, and presentation have been used to maintain power differentials and
compromise progress toward social justice. It builds a knowledge base of data
handling, elementary descriptive and inferential statistics, computer use in
analysis, and interpretation. It provides an opportunity for students to
develop skills in data analysis, computer use, and data interpretation.

  
**Course Objectives**

At the end of this course the student will be able to:

1\. demonstrate improved critical thinking skills, especially with regard to
the use, production, and interpretation of data relevant to professional
social work practice;

2\. analyze and interpret data and use computers in a manner consistent with
accepted social work ethics;

3\. demonstrate an understanding of the need to incorporate data analysis
skills as a part of the professional use of self;

4\. use and produce data to more effectively understand discrimination and
oppression and to advance social and economic justice;

5\. analyze and interpret data and use computers to develop more effective
methods of social work practice;

6\. use and produce data to evaluate the effectiveness of practice and to
participate in agency and community evaluations of programs and practice;

7\. demonstrate computer and data analysis skills useful in the process of
assessing the adequacy of policy in relation to human needs and in taking
planned action to develop and change social policy;

8\. demonstrate the ability to apply existing data and generate additional
data appropriate to practice with a variety of clients, situations, and social
change systems.

  
**Course Assignments**

A. The text below is recommended. It is a good one but expensive. Some
students find that, with the handouts and other course materials, it is not
necessary to buy the text. It will make the course material easier to follow
and comprehend. It is also an excellent reference book which will be useful
throughout your social work career, not just for data analysis but also for
questions that you may have about other research processes. What I am saying
is: get it if you can afford it but you may be able to do well in this course
without it.

Rubin, Allen and Earl Babbie. **_Research Methods for Social Work (fourth
edition)._** Belmont, CA: Wadsworth, 2001.

Reading assignments in the texts are indicated in the outline below. These
assignments should be completed prior to the class sessions for which they are
assigned. There will also be several handouts available on the course website.
These are also required reading and are to be read for the session after they
are assigned.

There are several other books which expand on the required reading in the text
and present much of this material in other ways. These are listed in the
bibliography at the end of this syllabus. Many are available in the library or
on loan from Professor Sanborn. It is highly recommended that students use the
text or one of these.  
  
B. Class attendance:

Class attendance is strongly recommended. Material will be presented in
lecture and demonstrated on the computer which is not otherwise available.
Class time will include opportunities to work on the computer assignments with
individualized instruction. It is necessary to come to class to learn the
material in this course.  
  
C. There are three types of graded assignments:

1\. There will be several quizes. These will be closed-book and in-class. They
will be given as announced in class. They may be made up only if missed for an
excusable reason. These will count as 40% of the course grade.

2\. There will be a series of projects based on each student's analysis and
interpretation of his/her own research results. All of these assignments must
be completed to pass the course. Due dates will be announced in class. Late
assignments will be accepted but penalized. The average of these will count as
40% of the course grade.

3\. There will be a final exam. It will be a take-home exam. It will count as
20% of the course grade.

**_Any student needing to make arrangements for special considerations in
graded assignments due to disabilities, including learning disabilities, are
encouraged to discuss these arrangements with the instructor._**

D. The course grade will be computed on the basis of the percentages described
above. The numerical result of this process will result in the assignment of a
letter grade on the following basis:

90% or above = A |  80 - 83% = B- | 70 - 73% = C-  
---|---|---  
87 - 89% = B+ |  77 - 79% = C+ | 60 - 69% = D  
83 - 87% = B |  73 - 77% = C | Below 60% = F  
  
A grade of C- or better is required to graduate as a social work major with a
BSW degree.

Several of the books above, and many more, are available in the library and
bookstore. Again, try to gain some familiarity with one of these before you
make a decision to buy. There is no requirement that you purchase a
supplemental book, but you will find one very helpful this semester and in
your future career.

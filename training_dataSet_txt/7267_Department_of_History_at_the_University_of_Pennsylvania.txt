Course Goals:  In the 
1990s, the United States continues to engage in a debate, which has raged 
on and off throughout the century, over the appropriate role of the 
federal government in providing basic sustenance for the disadvantaged.  
Today, as in the past, this debate raises fundamental questions about 
equity within a democratic nation.  There is little consensus on the 
causes of disadvantage, or the appropriate responses, or what part of 
society - the federal government, state governments, or private charities 
- should be responding.  What constitutes an acceptable minimum standard 
of living, how race and gender interact with disadvantage, and many other 
issues remain unsettled in political circles.
These questions have a 
long history, and American answers to them have remained intact in some 
ways while shifting in other ways.  This course will explore the origin 
and path of this debate, and examine how the welfare state has been 
shaped as a result.   

Course Assignments: There 
are six short paper (2-3 pages) assignments, each of which will count for 
7.5% of the overall grade.  These papers should respond to a specific 
reading, either a book or an article, and must be handed in BEFORE the 
first time the class discusses that book or article.  (For example, if 
you wish to write a paper responding to Linda Gordon's Pitied But Not 
Entitled, it must be handed in by the start of class on January 
28th.)  You must do AT LEAST one paper in each section of the class.  
There is also a term paper (10-15 pages, and 30% of the overall grade), 
which must be handed in by Friday, April 25th.  The nature of this paper 
and potential topics will be discussed in class.
In addition, you are 
also expected to come to class every week and to be prepared to actively 
discuss the week's reading assignment.  Class discussion will account for 
25% of the overall grade.

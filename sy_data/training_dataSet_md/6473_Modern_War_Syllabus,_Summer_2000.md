**_"You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you."_**
Trotsky

War is most often studied by either its practitioners or its bitter enemies.
The first give us technical details and neat battle plans; the second show us
the dead and mutilated, in soul or body. However, war is an integral part of
history. It is conducted (or avoided) by human beings in societies whose
political, cultural and economic characteristics affect their military
institutions and practices. We will examine the development of the theory,
nature, and practice of modern war, with particular emphasis on the viewpoint
of the ordinary person involved in a war.

**Goals:**  
Students who successfully complete the course will have (1) increased their
knowledge and understanding of the interconnections between war and society in
the past two centuries; (2) used their knowledge of the past to deepen their
understanding of contemporary military events; and (3) by reading about modern
wars through the eyes of ordinary people, developed a sense of what it was
like to live then and there, as opposed to here and now.

**Grades:**  
Grades will be based on book and map quizzes (25%), a mid-term (25%), a film
review (15%), and a final (30%). Class attendance and participation is
expected, and will count for 5% of the final grade.  The plus-minus system
will be used.

Students who plagiarize or cheat in any way will earn an F. If you are unsure
about the definition of plagiarism, see the definition provided in _Clifford's
Advice._

**REQUIRED BOOKS:**  
Larry Addington, _The Patterns of War Since the 18 th Century_ [Patterns in
assignments below]  
Jakob Walter, _The Diary of a Napoleonic Foot Soldier_.  
James M. McPherson, _What They Fought For_.  
John Ellis, _Eye-Deep in Hell: Trench Warfare in World War I_.  
E.B. Sledge, _With the Old Breed: At Peleliu and Okinawa_.  
K.G. Turner with Phan Thanh Hao, _Even the Women Must Fight: Memories of War
from North Vietnam_.

A historical atlas is strongly recommended (we will have map quizzes) but
optional; the bookstore will stock _Hammond's Historical Atlas_.

**BOOK AND MAP QUIZZES:**  
For each of the five outside reading books, students will be required to
prepare a 2-3 paragraph discussion question, which may be e-mailed in advance
or brought to class on the day that book is to be discussed. The questions are
very broad; however, your answers should include specific examples from the
reading. No late submissions will be accepted. There will also be two map
quizzes. No makeups will be given. The top 5 of the seven grades will be
counted, with this exception: failure to turn in a book discussion question
will be counted as a 0 that **may not** be dropped.

**CLASS PARTICIPATION:**  
The structure of the summer six-week session makes attendance particularly
important: every class session is the equivalent of a week during the regular
term. You should therefore make every effort to attend every class. During
each session we will be engaged in several different ways of coming to grips
with the subjects at hand, and one of those is discussion. You cannot discuss
intelligently if you have not read the material _before_ the discussion - and
remember that a significant question is often a major contribution to
discussion. One regular feature will be a weekly discussion of current
military events. You can prepare for these discussions by reading a good
newspaper or newsmagazine, or listening to NPR. You will find some useful
sites linked from our class web page.

**FILM REVIEW:**  
Each student must review a film about World War II, and write a 3-4 page
typed, double-spaced **history-oriented** review. The review should include
the basic information about the film (title, date, director, lead actors) and
a brief account of subject matter, but the bulk of the paper should consist of
analysis and critical review. We will spend time in class discussing how to
view and analyze a film historically. Choose your film from the list that will
be handed out in class; any substitutions must have prior approval.

Approximately 15 Listening Exercises (15%) One from each chapter  
Approximately 15 reviews of In-class Performances (30%) There will be over 15
, but  you should choose 15 and write approximately 2 typed pages on each.  
Three Reviews of Outside Performances (one of JHU Symphony performances and
two others of your own choice) (15%)  
One 5-page project (e.g., comparing three performances of the same work,
interviewing three musicians, designing a concert series) (15%)

Various opportunities for Extra Credit (up to 10%)

####  COURSE GOALS

Music from different styles, historical periods, and repertories, including
jazz and popular, will form the basis of a class that explores how musical
ideas (often embodied in written score, but just as frequently improvised) get
translated into music. Students will have an opportunity to interact with the
performers in an effort to discover what ingredients go into making a musical
performance. Work will consist of reading and listening assignments, tests,
reviews of class performances, outside performances, and a term project.  
1\. Essay answers should be typed, double-spaced. Please put your name and
date on every page and staple.  
2\. Be sure to answer all parts to each assignment.  
3\. Proofread!  Sloppiness will affect the grade of an otherwise perfectly
good paper. Presentation is important to the success of your project. Be aware
of both form and content.  
4\. When quoting or using extensive material from another source, be sure to
give proper citations in the form of a footnote or endnote. Please consult a
style guide (Turabian, Chicago Manual of Style, etc).  
5\. Plagiarism, cheating, and other forms of academic dishonesty will not be
tolerated. Please adhere to the principles of academic honor and integrity as
stipulated in the Johns Hopkins handbook.  
There is a stiff penalty for cheating, so do your own work.  
6\. Assignments must be turned in on time and typed.  Grades will be lowered
for late work.  
The final grade will be based on written work, tests, and overall class
participation, particularly during the performances. Keep up with reading and
listening assignments and feel free to make an appointment should you feel you
need help.

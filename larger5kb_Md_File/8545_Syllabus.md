**__OBJECTIVE__**

The objective of the course is to provide an advanced discussion of
contemporary issues facing public administrators.  As such, I assume that you
have some background in political science and/or public administration.  The
title of the course (problems in public administration) indicates that there
is a distinction between administration in the public and private sector.
Why?  How does the public sector differ from the private sector?  In exploring
this question, we will address the following topics:  differences and
similarities between the public and private sector, privatization and
contracting-out of government services; the accountability and discretion of
public decisionmakers, and the ethics of public roles.  Hopefully, these
discussions will help you to appreciate the many constraints that public
administrators face.  Thus, the course is not designed to convince you whether
public bureaucracies are good or bad, but to think carefully and analytically
about why they exist and how they function.  As such, you will be exposed to
both positive and negative arguments about public bureaucracies.  In the end,
it is hoped that you will begin to have an understanding of the complexity and
diversity of different types of bureaucracies and be challenged to think of
creative and constructive ways of engaging in reform.

**__COURSE REQUIREMENTS__**

Class participation is an important component of this class.  Participation
consists of being present in class, having read all assignments prior to the
beginning of class, being active in class discussions, and performance on
homeworks and oral presentations.  Because class participation is important,
it will count as 10% of your final grade.  In addition, completion of a
written research paper is required.  This paper comprises 30% of the final
grade.  Details regarding this paper are outlined on a separate handout.  A
take-home mid-term and final exam comprise the remaining 60% of the grade.

**__CLASS FORMAT__**

Most class sessions will consist of lecturing and/or discussion on the
assigned topics.  Everyone is expected to read the assigned readings
**before** class and come to class prepared to discuss that day's reading.
Your class participation grade depends on your presence in class and the
quality and quantity of your verbal contributions.  The reason I place such
importance on class participation is because your presence is a vital part of
a successful class.  While many students are shy and have a difficult time
participating in class, I strongly encourage you to do so.  Your learning
experience will be much greater from having done so.  If something in the
lecture confuses you; you should let me know.  Similarly, if you believe you
have something to add to a discussion, please do so. A note on class etiquette
is also in order.  First, I expect you to generally come to class on time.
However, if you need to arrive to class late, please feel free to enter the
classroom quietly and unobtrusively.  I would rather have you in class for
part of the class period than not at all.   Second, please come to class
prepared to focus on the class discussion.  It is rude to work on other
assignments and/or read _The Alligator_ in class.   It is a distraction for me
and for your fellow classmates.  Third, if you must bring beepers and/or
cellular phones to class, please be sure they are turned off during the class
period.  


**__PAPER__**

Each student will participate in a [written project](Paper_Assignment.htm).
Details regarding this project are outlined on a [separate
page](Paper_Assignment.htm). Topic choices for the project will be made on
**Friday, January 29th.**   An outline and annotated bibliography of the
project is due on **Monday, February 22nd**. The final paper is due on
**Friday, April 9th**. Both components of the assignment will contribute to
the final grade on the project. The final project should be computer-
generated, double-spaced, with 1" margins all around, and in a font size no
smaller than 11. Late papers will be penalized five points for each day late.  


**__EXAMS__**

Both the midterm and final examinations will be take home exams.  As such,
they must be computer-generated, double-spaced with 1" margins all around, and
in a font size no smaller than 11.  The midterm examination is due at the
beginning of class on **Friday, March 5th**.   The final examination is due at
**5:30pm on Tuesday, April 27th in 3342 Turlington Hall**.   All exams not
turned in on time will result in a 0. **Makeup exams will only be given under
extraordinary circumstances and require documentation.**

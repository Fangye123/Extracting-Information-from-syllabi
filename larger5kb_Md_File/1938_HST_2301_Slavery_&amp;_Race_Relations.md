This course will examine the evolution of slavery and the status of race
relations in the United States. Various themes and issues relating to the
history of slavery and race relations in America will be explored. Strong
emphasis will be placed on how slavery developed in the United States and the
impact it had on race relations in modern America. Some of the issues which
the course will raise include first encounters between Europeans and Africans,
the slave trade, the growth of slavery in America, emancipation, and the
effects of slavery on American society.

### **COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND EXPECTATIONS**

Students are expected to do all the assigned readings and papers and will be
expected to take part in class discussions. There will be short quizzes once a
week on Friday. Two short papers (20%), a mid-term paper (20%), final paper
(20%), quizzes (20%), class participation and class attendance (20%) will make
up the course grade. There will be no makeups without a valid excuse. Late
papers will not be accepted.

Discussion sessions and films are mandatory. If you have reason to miss a film
it is your responsibility to view it in your own time and turn in a write up.
Failure to do so will result in lost points. Class participation requires
students to attend each class, do all the readings and have something to say
about them in the discussion sessions. Friday discussion sessions are
mandatory. On time attendance is required. If you will be more than 15 minutes
late please do not bother to come as this disrupts the rest of the class.

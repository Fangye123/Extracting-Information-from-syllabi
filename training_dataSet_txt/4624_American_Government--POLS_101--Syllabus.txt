Required Readings
This book has been ordered through the UIC
Bookstore:

Thomas R. Dye and Harmon Zeigler, The Irony of Democracy,
     Millennial Edition (Harcourt Brace, 2000) 

I will also hand out photocopied items for
you to read from time to time. 



Course Description
This course has two objectives. The first is
to help you learn to think about government and politics. The second is to
familiarize you with a body of information about our politics, history, and
institutions of government. Under the first objective, we will try to develop
your critical thinking ability. "Critical" does not mean
"negative." It means your ability to free yourself, temporarily, from
your preconceptions and take a new, fresh look at something--a look that is uniquely
yours. 
The course has a theme, which is to examine
American politics by asking whether or not the nation is governed by an elite,
by democratic pluralism, or under some other system. We will be asking both empirical
and normative questions about this nation's politics. Empirical
statements attempt to portray the world as it is. Normative statements are
phrased in terms of what ought to be. Simply put, empirical statements are
about facts, and normative statements are about values. The distinction between
the two kinds of statements is often hard to make in practice, but it is a
useful analytical tool, so we will begin by accepting that there is a
difference, and learn to question it later. For example, an empirical statement
about democracy might be, "American is (or is not) a democracy." A
normative statement might be, "America should (or should not) be a
democracy." We will be examining questions like this, looking at them from
a variety of perspectives, and along the way absorbing a considerable amount of
information about the American system of government that should help you answer
some of these questions for yourself.
I hope we will have an open and lively class
discussion every session, and one which is also respectful of differences of
opinion and always civil and polite. Please be assured that you cannot possibly
hurt your grade by disagreeing with what you think I believe, nor can you help
it by agreeing! And I should warn you that I often play 'Devil's
Advocate." That means I will defend positions with which I disagree. I am
most likely to do this if I think the classroom discussion is too one-sided.
Above all, suspend your quick judgements about things, listen to your
classmates, read your books, and think about things as if you were encountering
them for the first time. 



Course Requirements

Midterm examination (25%):
     Given as set in the course schedule below, this will combine objective and
     essay format in about a 50/50 format. 
Final examination(25%):
     Same format as the midterm, given on the day and time set by the
     University. 
Weekly reaction papers (10%):
     Every Monday you will turn in a one-page summary of the readings,
     concluding with two or three questions or issues that struck you as
     particularly significant. 
Media Journal (15%) You
     will keep a journal with clippings and your comments, tracing issues you
     consider important. More about this later, but the idea is for you to get
     informed, and also to learn to consider the influence of the media on the
     way issues are framed, the values they promote, the things they include
     and exclude, and other aspect of a critical perspective on the media. 
Political Film paper
     (15%): You will compare and critically evaluate a pair of political films
     from a list I will provide. Again, more about this later. 
Participation (10%):
     Attendance is mandatory. I will take roll at the start of every class
     session. Anybody missing more than six classes will fail the course. You
     are also being evaluated on the quality of your participation, meaning the
     degree to which you help us have a productive classroom community.
     Civility, originality,intelligence, preparation...these are the things to
     bring to the discussion.

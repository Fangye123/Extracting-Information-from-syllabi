**Introduction** to  "Religion and Politics in Early Korea."

The religious traditions of Six Dynasties China exercised significant
influence on the political formations of the three kingdoms of Koguryo,
Paekche, and Silla (see the map on the penultimate page of this syllabus).

The early kings of Koguryo maintained diplomatic relations with northern
Chinese states and were introduced to Buddhist texts, images, and models of
royal authority by monks sent by Chinese rulers. Koguryo's kings also
established a Chinese-style legal system and a state Confucian academy, and
they continued to revere local gods an shamanistic traditions.

Paekche learned of continental traditions through contacts with southern
Chinese states, and Buddhism flourished under royal patronage. As in Koguryo,
the state ordered the construction of Buddhist temples, the reading of
Buddhist sutras, and the performance of Buddhist rituals.

Silla, although the last of the three kingdoms to be introduced to Buddhism,
was the most active in recognizing its political significance. The kings of
Silla named themselves and members of their families after Indian Buddhist
royalty and even abdicated the throne to become monks. In their efforts to
dominate the peninsula, Silla kings presented themselves as _chakravartins_ ,
mythical Buddhist sovereigns whose moral force assured them universal
dominion. This fusion of political and religious ideals may be seen as well in
the institution of the _hwarang_ , an association of aristocratic youths
focused on the Buddha Maitreya, whose duty was the material and spiritual
defense of the realm.

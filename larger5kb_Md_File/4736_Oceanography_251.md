The text assigned for the course is a new one, a 4th Edition of Duxbury, et
al. There will be two copies of the text on reserve in my office plus an
office nearby where you can

read the material until the bookstore gets the book order in.

**_Class Objectives:_**



1.   To give an overview of the science of oceanography, and how it is practiced.



2.     To inform how the ocean, especially the coastal ocean, is related to everyday life. 



3.   To encourage students to discuss the subject material and to apply the principles learned to solving problems.



4.   To appreciate the beauty of the ocean, and the elegance of the science that deals with it.





**_Grading Policies:_**

**_ _**

_Please_ read this carefully. It is to your advantage to understand it from
the very first of the class.



There will be 3 short (15-20 minute) **quizzes** , and an **exam**.



**Quizzes** : The quizzes will be short and objective, mostly multiple choice.
You will fill out a scantron sheet with the answers. Each quiz will count 25%
of the course grade.



**The Exam** will count 25% of the course grade and will be the same format as
the quizzes.

It will be cumulative over the whole course. Study questions and sample
questions will be available to help you study for the quizzes and exams.



**Makeup exams** will be given if a university-accepted excuse is presented.
Makeups will be given within a month of the time of the original exam; they
will be in a discussion question format.



**Calculating Semester Grades** :

            3 quizzes = 75 points (25 points each)

            1 exam = 25 points 

            Total credit for the course = 100 points, or the sum of the two parts above.



**Class attendance** is strongly recommended. Attendance will be taken on
random days. If you miss more than 20% of the classes for which roll is taken,
you will lose benefit of the doubt on exam questions. Otherwise there is not a
penalty.





**_Requirements for Students:_**

You must have an email account and be able to access the Internet.  The first
class assignment is to send me an e-mail message.

**_ADA Statement:_**



The American with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students
with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a
disability requiring an accommodation, please contact the Department of
Student Life, Services for Students with Disabilities in Room 126 of the
Koldus Building. The phone number is 845-1637.

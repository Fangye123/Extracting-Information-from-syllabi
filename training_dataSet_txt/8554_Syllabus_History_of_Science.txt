BRIEF DESCRIPTION

A study of the origins, nature, and development of Western science, and its social, economic, and cultural context.

The  Content is described in the Course Calendar

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
At the end of this course, if we are successful, you will be able to:

To learn the chronological development of science
To investigate the development of science as a historical
process of change and continuity
To appreciate science as a social institution and its relationships with other human institutions
To obtain insights into other moral, religious, and philosophical aspects of science as revealed in its history
To provide a wider context for science than in professional training, and thus bridge the gap between professional and humanistic studies

CONTENT
The history of science is certainly a vital subject full of surprise turns and twists.  It may be the best way to understand how the pervading world view held at any time overwhelmingly influences how we interpret our experience.  We will make much of the changing world views.

It would be ridiculous to attempt to cover all that is implied in the title of
this course.  To meet the objectives of the course we will trace the 
certain specific scientists whose contribution are among the best examples to be found of how science changes and shapes the world views it interacts with.  Many more scientists of all the world have contributed to the body of knowledge that we call today "Science."  In a 10-week course we cannot hope to discuss even the most important.

RESOURCES

There is no text book for the course.  You are expected to use current print material and the World Wide Web (WWW)
to search out items that relate specificially to the topics to be discussed and be
prepared to discuss them in class.  

REQUIREMENTS

Your grade in the course is determined by the number of "points" you
accumulate.  This allows you to choose what work you do, and what to do if you
fall down in one area to raise your grade in another area:


 Midterm I 	250 points 
 Midterm II	250 points
 Participation	150 points
 Research	300 points
 Final Exam	300 points

Your grade will be determined (strictly!) from the following table:


	1125 - 1250	A
	1000 - 1124	B
	 875 -  999	C
	 750 -  874	D
	BELOW 750	F

There will be two midterms and a final.  The questions will be based on class presentations and material posted on the WWW. The exam format is explained below in METHOD.  All questions on the midterms will be taken from the list of discussion questions.

The Final will be somewhat different and it is explained below.

A research project is required.

METHOD

TECHNICAL SKILLS NOT ESSENTIAL - I believe the material should be of
interest to all students, and therefore I will try to present it in a way that
no student will be handicapped by his or her particular background.  Technical
material will be presented, but not in a way that requires a scientific or
engineering background.  Historical, political, and economic questions will be
raised, but not in a way that demands considerable acquaintance with these
areas

DISCUSSION IN CLASS IMPORTANT - I want discussion in the classroom.  I will
come prepared to give a lecture.  You will have adequate time to review the
material I will present and to prepare yourself to raise questions and
criticize my arguments.  I appreciate interruptions and diversions;  only by
your active participation can we bring out the biases hidden in the various
assumptions about science in this or any other society

TELECOMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY REQUIRED - A great deal of communication 
in this course will be by use of the RIT VAX computer or the WWW.  You must 
have an account on the VAX.  If you do not have one, get one! I will 
explain in class what you are to do and will be available to show you how to do 
anything which may mystify you.  Not everyone feels comfortable with computers.  
I require you to use this system to receive materials for study, discussion questions, and any updates I need to announce.  

EVALUATION

Each midterm has 20 questions. All questions will be taken from the discussion 
questions.

The final exam will have 35 questions.  The first 20 questions will be taken
from Preparation Questions from all sessions.  The last 15 questions will be
new questions you have not seen before.  These questions will be integrative
and cover all the material studied in the entire quarter.

There will be an important research project  which will be a significant part 
of your grade. There are very strict rules on how the project must be done.

RULES OF THE GAME

Attendance:  I may keep track of attendance, at least in the beginning, to
learn your names and faces.  Your attendance will definitely influence my
impression, so you will not want to miss any classes.

I can be found in my office during most of the day.  In invite you and
encourage you to come by and talk to me about anything.  If you cant get me at
school, leave a message on my telephone answering machine or on my door.

I will often need to communicate with you via the RIT VAX computer.  If
you have an account, tell me your username immediately.  If you do not have an
account, get one, and inform me.

Good luck in the course.

[Discussion section with Sayres Rudy, Thursday, 6-7.30PM, 902IAB]


Liberalism is a term that soaks up a great deal of meaning.  The course will
seek to clarify relationships among: (1) liberalism as a doctrine created in
early modern Europe to tame religious passions and restrain unbridled
sovereignty; (2) the liberal tradition in America, which, variously, has been
represented either as the hegemonic organizing principle of the American regime
or as one among other contested organizing themes for more than two centuries;
and (3) liberalism as a political position and policy repertoire in the give
and take of American politics, with a primary home in the Democratic party,
especially since the New Deal.  The class seeks to integrate these foci by
exploring liberalism's shifting boundary between the included and excluded and
by examining the extent to which liberalism can be made sufficiently social to
embrace group as well as individual units of agency.  

In so doing, the course will bring together literatures often kept apart.  We
will read some basic texts in the development of liberalism, recent
considerations on liberalism by political theorists and philosophers,
scholarship on American political thought, and work on Democratic party
liberalism.  The (perhaps not so) hidden aim is to encourage trespassing across
boundaries dividing history from political science, theory from empirical work,
and the study of American politics from the other subdisciplines in political
science.  

There will be an in-

class
midterm and a take-

home
final.

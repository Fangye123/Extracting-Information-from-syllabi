**Format** ****  
This class is based on a format of independent, self-managed work time,
instructor supervision, and final critique/presentations.  Each student will
design, develop, and manage a large-scale (or several small-scale) individual
or group projects over the course of a semester.  After initial planning
phases with the instructor, students will work entirely independently on their
projects according to their own schedules and project plans.  Each student
must work **15 hours per week** for fall and spring semesters **** or **30
hours per week** for summer semesters to fulfill course requirements.
Students will be required to monitor and track their time and report their
progress to the instructor on a weekly basis.

**Grading** ****  
Course work will consist entirely of large-scale (or several small-scale)
portfolio projects.  The final grade will reflect the quality of the final
project as well as the student's weekly progress (according to their outlined
project plans) and fulfillment of required work hours per week.

**Projects**  
Each student will design, develop, and manage a large-scale (or several small-
scale) individual or group projects over the course of a semester.  Students
will manage their projects over the course of a semester by detailing written
project plans including project descriptions, weekly goals and milestones, and
documentation of weekly work activities and recorded hours.  Detailed plans
must be prepared by the student and approved by the instructor before
beginning project work.  All projects are due at the end of the semester
during finals week although work and progress must be demonstrated on a weekly
basis for successful completion of the course (see below).  **Projects not
completed by the end of the semester will result in failure in the course.**
Final project critiques consisting of imagery-based projects (3D animations or
still imagery) will be graded on the use of 1) effective design principles, 2)
expressive creativity, 3) thoughtful concept, 4) well-executed craftsmanship,
and 5) adherence to project objectives and guidelines.  Final project
presentations consisting of programmatic-based projects (3D graphic programs,
simulations, plug-ins, etc¡­) will be graded on the program's ability to meet
the assigned input and design criteria and correct program operation. ****

**Progress**  
A substantial portion of the grade will be based on the student's ability to
document, estimate, manage, and demonstrate project progress on a **weekly**
basis.   Each student must work **15 hours per week** for fall and spring
semesters or **30 hours per week** for summer semesters to fulfill course
requirements.   **Unsuccessful completion of these required hours will result
in failure in the course.   **Work hours must be documented and results
demonstrated to the instructor on a weekly basis.

> In this course we will explore an overview of the basic elements which have
shaped the U.S. presence in Latin America and the way in which Latin America
has been represented in the United States from the early nineteenth century to
the present day, exploring both official (public) policy as well as the impact
of corporations and the market, ideology, cultural representations, the media,
and others.

>

> The course has five main objectives: 1) To encourage you to think deeply
about the nature of U.S.-Latin American interactions and how they are shaped;
2) To develop an analysis which can explain U.S. public policy in Latin
America over an extended period of time; 3) To think critically about the
binary which is formed between "domestic" and "foreign" policy, and how it
comes about; 4) To suggest the ways in which Latin America and Latin Americans
have agency in their dealings with their much more (economically and
militarily) powerful neighbor to the North; and 5) To problematize the idea of
a single "Latin American" or "U.S." subject. The assignments for the course
will sharpen your ability to read and discuss critically, to work in groups,
and to present your conclusions in a variety of formats.

>

> The course will meet twice a week. Generally speaking, on Tuesdays I will
give a lecture while Thursdays will most often be devoted to discussions,
films, presentations, and other activities. You are always responsible for
completing the week's reading by the Thursday class session.

>

> **CLASS REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**

>

> All students will be responsible for keeping up with the weekly readings and
for participating in class discussions. You are required to complete four
projects over the course of the semester.

>

>> (a) [Due **February 19** at the beginning of
class](http://www.oberlin.edu/~svolk/294s021stpaper.htm) : A five-page paper
in which you present your initial thoughts/hypotheses, on causality in foreign
policy: what are the major factors which have influenced the shaping of U.S.
foreign policy in Latin America. You can react to the readings of the first
week, or apply the concepts to the elaboration of the Monroe Doctrine in 1823.
(Individual project; 15% of grade).

>>

>> (b) [Due **March 12** at the beginning of
class](http://www.oberlin.edu/~svolk/294s022ndpaper.htm) : A five-page paper
focusing on the Spanish-U.S.-Cuban War of 1898. You can address why the U.S.
went to war; why, at the end of this war, the United States chose to
incorporate Spain's remaining colonies (Puerto Rice, Guam, the Philippines,
and, for a short time, Cuba) as U.S. colonies, employing a "classic" mode of
colonial intervention, while it didn't practice this form of expansion either
before or after that time; what were the consequences of the war; or any other
project related to this period. You _must_ exchange a draft of this paper with
one student in the course prior to turning in your final draft. (Individual-
joint project; 15% of grade).  
>>

>> (c) [Due **April 16 [note: this extended to April 23]** at the beginning of
class](http://www.oberlin.edu/~svolk/294s023rd.htm): A project which explores
non-state interactions between the United States and Latin America. I would
like you to explore any of a wide panoply of non-official (non-governmental)
interactions between the United States and Latin America. You can focus on
economic, cultural, non-governmental political, social, or other interactions.
For example, you can exploring representations of Latin America/Latin
Americans in U.S. media (film, video, music, cartoons, etc.); you can focus on
private economic interactions (e.g., U.S. corporations in Latin America; the
impact of private remittances from Latin American immigrants in the U.S.,
etc.); on technology transfer between the U.S. and Latin America; on the
impact of U.S. consumer culture in Latin America, etc. You must clear your
topic with me. This assignment is designed to be a _group_ project which
should involve 3-4 people per group. The format in which you present your
project is open - it can be a written paper, a performance, a video, or any
other media form. Again, this needs to be cleared with me. (Group project; 40%
of grade).

>>

>>  (d) [Due **May 14** at 4:30
p.m.](http://www.oberlin.edu/~svolk/294s02finalproject.htm) : A 10-12 page
paper (or its equivalent in another form that you discuss with me) exploring
any aspect of U.S. policy in Latin America. Your paper must be empirical
(based on research), and it must develop and present a thesis which (once
again) suggests the causal factors that have helped shape U.S. policy in Latin
America. This project can be written individually or in a group of no more
than 2 people (with each getting the same grade). There will be no extensions
allowed on this paper unless you request an official incomplete in the course.
(Individual or joint project; 30% of grade).

>

> Papers turned in late without permission (which must be requested _prior_ to
the due date) will be graded down one grade-step each day it is late. For
example, a paper which deserved an "A" if handed in when due on March 12 would
get an "A-" if handed in on March 13; a "B+" on March 14; a "B" on March 15,
etc. As noted, the final paper is due on Mary 14, the last day of the reading
period. There will be no extensions granted on this project unless you apply
for and receive an official incomplete in the course.

>

> Excessive absences from class will have an adverse effect on your final
grade as you are **all** responsible for the learning that goes on in this
class. Finally, **all** projects must be submitted to pass the course.

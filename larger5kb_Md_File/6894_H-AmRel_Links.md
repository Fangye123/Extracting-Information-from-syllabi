     <http://www.wfu.edu/~matthetl/perspectives/index.html>
     _"This course is designed to give the student a feel for the rich diversity of religious experience in the United States. It also will serve as a a resource for helping the student appreciate the impact religion has had on our nation's history and culture, and how various faith traditions have been shaped, in turn, by their encounter with America."_

     Prof. Paul Harris

     Prof. Gregory Holmes Singleton
     Northeastern Illinois University
     <http://www.neiu.edu/~ghsingle/435.htm>
     _"Through a consideration of representative scholarship, we will explore the complex and fascinating world at the intersection of religion and public life in American history. We will particularly probe the "mainstream" and the "periphery" in the public aspects of religious life in the United States in order to a) determine if these two general categories have any useful meaning and b) if so, what that might tell us about public life in the United States ge nerally."_

Students will write several papers, including a paper based on original research, and exams are of the essay variety."_

     Prof. Donald F. M. Gerardi
     Brooklyn College
     <http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/history/dfg/amrl/arx-main.htm>

     Prof. Paul harvey

       **Religion in America** (History 380F)
     Prof. Phyllis Amenda
     Binghamton University (SUNY)
     [http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~pamenda/index.htm ](http://bingweb.binghamton.edu/~pamenda/index.htm)
     "Religious movements do not exist in a cultural vacuum. All religious expression is shaped by political, economic, and cultural factors. This course seeks to understand how religion, especially Protestant Chri stianity, has both shaped and been shaped by political, economic, and cultural conditions in the U.S. After doing a brief survey of the development of religion in the antebellum U.S., the course will focus on three case studies of religious reactions to t he urban industrialization in the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era. The three reactions we will look at are the Social Gospel, fundamentalism and pentecostalism. By examining the origins of these three movements in their broader cultural and political c ontext, we can appreciate their unique contributions to American society and their broader global ramifications." 

  
       **Religion and Politics in America** (Political Science 603/Religion 603 )      Prof. Timothy J. O'Neill
     Southwestern University
     [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~amrel/links/oneill.htm](oneill.htm)
     "This course explores the relationship, and occasionally the tension, between religious and political impulses and values in America. Our approach will be both theological and political, analyzing the changes and continuity in religious and political beliefs and structures. Topics include how religion encourages political action (disputes over abolitionism, prohibition, abortion, and nuclear arms), how politics affects religion (religious pluralism, the develo pment of black churches, Mormons and Jehovah Witnesses), and how we are affected by both. Be advised that this is an area in which reasonable people can (and should?) disagree."

  
       **The Religions of the American Peoples** (American Studies 241)

     "Purposes of Course: To provide students with basic knowledge of the cultural and religious experience of some of the major ethnic communities in North America whose origins have been primarily non-European. To examine the impact of immigration and ethnicity on the pluralistic character of American culture and society as reflected in its religious communities. To develop skills of analysis and expression." 

  
       **Protestantism and the Development of American Culture** (American Studies 341)      Prof. Peter W. Williams
     Miami University
     [http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~amrel/links/williams3.htm](williams3.htm)
     "This course is first designed to describe some of the major varieties or "families" of Protestant Christianity in the United States (and its colonial antecedents) in terms of their origins and historical deve lopments; distinctive beliefs, practices, patterns of worship and of organization; and the sociological and geographical circumstances of their appeal."

  
       **Nature and Religion in American Society** (Religious Studies 451)
     Prof. Rachel Miller
     Lewis and Clark College
     <http://www.h-net.msu.edu/~amrel/links/r451-nras.html>

       **Religion in the South** (Religion 466)
     Prof. Terry Matthews
     Wake Forest University
     <http://www.wfu.edu:/~matthetl/south/>
     _"Hopefully, by the end of the semester, each student will have developed an appreciation of the rich religious history of the South, as well as an awareness of the intellectual, moral, political, social and economic forces that helped mold the region and give it a distinctive ethos. For it was this diversity of culture that served to shape religious experience in the South, and it was religion, in turn, that helped to fashion and mold the values and vision of the region."_

The Practice of Public History

_

Scope_: History H542, the foundation course for the department=s graduate
program in public history, provides an introduction to the theory and practice
of interpreting history for the public. During the semester the class will
consider the development of public history in the United States, discuss key
issues and concepts related to the public practice of the historian=s craft,
and gain practical experience in the methods and instruments of public
history. Guest speakers will provide additional insights to various venues
where public historians practice.

_

Methods_: Students are expected to be familiar with the readings in the
assigned text and the handout materials. Most of the class periods will be
devoted to discussion. However, there will be frequent individual student
presentations of their completed assignments. All students are expected to
engage in class discussions and in dialogues with guest speakers. In addition,
students will be expected to share their knowledge with the local community.
_All_ public history students should participate in community history
activities. Over the course of the semester a number of opportunities will be
announced in class.

_

Evaluation_: In addition to class and local community participation, this
course requires satisfactory completion of nine written projects which are
identified in the weekly assignments. Each project will be discussed in class
in advance of the due date, and all projects are described below. Each project
represents the following proportion of the final grade:

Project  | Percentage | Due Date  
---|---|---  
Exhibit review* | 10% | Aug. 28  
Exhibit proposal/news release | 20% | Sep. 25  
Interview* and resume | 10% | Oct. 2  
Antiques Roadshow* | 10% | Oct. 9  
Grant proposal  | 20% | Nov. 6  
Citizenship/class participation  | 10% | Nov. 20  
Issue paper | 20%  | Dec. 4  
  
*please print enough copies to distribute to your classmates



_

Policies_:

All students are expected to attend and participate in every class. Absence
without the advance consent of the instructor (barring unforeseen disasters)
will result in the loss of two (2) points on the _final_ course grade.

All projects are due on the date assigned. Failure to turn in a project on the
date due will result in the loss of two (2) points on the _final_ course grade
for each day the assignment is late.

A grade of zero (0) will be assigned to any work which has been produced by
cheating or plagiarism. The definitions of IUPUI are:

> > Cheating: Cheating is dishonesty of any kind with respect to examinations,
course assignments, alteration of records, or illegal possession of
examinations. It is the responsibility of the student not only to abstain from
cheating, but, in addition, to avoid the appearance of cheating and to guard
against making it possible for others to cheat. Any student who helps another
student to cheat is as guilty of cheating as the student assisted. The student
should also do everything possible to induce respect for the examining process
and for honesty in the performance of assigned tasks in or out of class.

>>

>> Plagiarism: Plagiarism is the offering of the work of someone else as one=s
own. Honesty requires that any ideas or materials taken from another source
for either written or oral use must be fully acknowledged. The language or
ideas taken from another may range from isolated formulas, sentences, or
paragraphs to entire articles copied from books, periodicals, speeches, or the
writings of other students. The offering of materials assembled or collected
by others in the form of projects or collections without acknowledgement is
also considered plagiarism. Any student who fails to give credit for ideas or
materials taken from another source is guilty of plagiarism.

A grade of Aincomplete@ will not be assigned except in the event of a
catastrophe such as serious personal illness or death of a family member. All
incompletes must be arranged in advance of the final day of class. Arrangement
for an incomplete will require the instructor=s approval of a signed statement
from the student about the reason for requesting the incomplete and a date
when all remaining work will be submitted.

GENERAL FORMAT FOR SUBMITTED PROJECTS:

All projects for this course must be typewritten, one-inch margins, double-
spaced, and in a readable print font similar in size to this syllabus. All
projects must also be composed in _excellent_ grammar and style with no
spelling errors. All notes and citations should conform to _Manual for
Writers_ (see texts). All projects should be proof read. Asking someone to
proof your project does not constitute cheating. Your name should be typed in
the upper right corner of the first page and may also be shown on subsequent
pages. Please do not use a title page. All pages should be numbered. In
general written projects should be stapled together (no folders, binders, or
dogears). In some cases (see above) you are required to print copies for your
classmates as well as the instructor. In all circumstances _be sure to keep a
copy of your project for your own files_.

PROJECT DESCRIPTIONS:

_

Exhibit Review_ (due August 28): each student will choose an exhibit to review
with the advice and consent of the instructor during the orientation/August
dinner of the department on August 21. The assignment is two-fold. Before
visiting the museum students should familiarize themselves with exhibit
reviews in the journal literature. I especially recommend as well Thomas
Schlereth, AMuseum Exhibit Review,@ _JAH_ 76 (June, 1989) 192-195. The review
should be no more than 3 pages long and should address such features as:
whether the exhibit is permanent, temporary, or traveling; what are the
physical circumstances of the exhibit; who created the exhibit; when was it
created; what was the intended audience; what is the primary (secondary,
tertiary) message of the exhibit; do the text and artifacts work well
together; could the message have been better presented in a different format.
At the beginning of your review be sure to show an appropriate citation of the
exhibit (again, see samples in professional journals). _Don =t forget to make
copies for your classmates_. Part two of the assignment will be to give a
three-minute oral presentation.

_

Exhibit Proposal/news release_ (due Sep. 25): each student will select an
object/topic/theme from a list handed out in class and create an exhibit and
news release related to it. The student may choose a hypothetical exhibit
format, location, budget, audience, and theme. Proposed exhibits may be
traveling, permanent, or temporary. They may be located in large well-funded
museums or temporary installations like state fairs or conventions. Audiences
may vary from the public at large to employees in a factory. Themes may vary
from the role of the object/topic/theme in society to its role for a small
group of individuals. The exhibit proposal will include a statement of
purpose, identification and description of the conditions listed above, a news
release announcing the exhibit, an exhibit script, identification of artifacts
to be included (with illustrations), and annotated list of sources consulted.
There will be between four and six panels or other exhibit features. Maximum
length of the proposal and support documents is 12-15 pages.

The news release should be clearly written, in a correct format (look for
samples), accurate, and newsworthy. Of course you should include in the first
paragraphs the standard what, where, when, who, and how (in whatever sequence
seems appropriate). Remember to be brief, but interesting, and keep in mind
that the public=s knowledge of history is limited. Also remember to avoid
jargon. Always include a name and address for further information.

_

Interview and resume_: (due Oct. 2): with the advice of the instructor each
student will select a public history professional in the Indianapolis area,
interview him/her, write a report of the interview and briefly discuss the
interview in class. Interview choices and appointments will be made by
September 18. Etiquette for interviews will be discussed in class. Each report
will discuss the conditions of the interview, the educational background of
the interviewee, his professional experience prior to the current job, a
definition of the current job, how his previous education and experience have
fitted him for the job, what additional education/experience he would like to
have, what are his career goals, and what is his advice to students planning
to enter the field, After the interview the student will write a thank-you
note to the interviewee. A copy of the note must be attached to the interview
report. _Don =t forget to make copies for your classmates_. Each student will
also submit a copy of his or her resume. Resume preparation will be discussed
in class.

_

Antiques Roadshow_ (due Oct. 9): each student will select an object and
analyze it. While this project does not focus on the estimated value of the
object, be sure to research and discuss: provenance, material(s),
craftsmanship, age, condition, use, and market. The assignment is two-fold.
Part one is to prepare a brief (roughly 4-5 page) paper that includes the
research and discussion points listed above. The second part of the project
will be a presentation in class on the night the project is due. Presentations
will be limited to 3-5 minutes and the presenter will entertain questions
afterwards. I will invite a guest authority to be our audience.

_

Grant proposal_ (due Nov. 6): each student will prepare the standard
application materials provided by the Indiana Humanities Council and the
Indiana Historical Society to apply for an Indiana Heritage Research Grant
(IHRG). Guidelines and samples will be handed out in early October. Before
students begin to fill out the application, they must prepare the Aprospectus@
form and discuss it with the instructor. These discussions and approval of the
project topic must be completed by October 23. Applications must meet the IHRG
guidelines; be feasible in terms of time frame, volume of work and human and
financial resources; clearly state the purpose and significance of the
project; and demonstrate the appropriateness of the budget. In the past, many
students have found local historical institutions that will host these
projects. Thus this assignment can serve as a rough draft for a full-fledged
grant proposal that can fund a student during the summer and provide an
important resume entry.

_

Citizenship/class participation_ (due Nov. 20): each student is expected to
participate in class and in the local history community. Class participation
extends well beyond being familiar with each week=s reading assignments and
presenting exhibit reviews, interview reports, and Antiques Roadshow analyses
in class. All students are expected to participate each week in class
discussion and will be called upon if they do not volunteer. Be sure not only
to read the weekly assignments, but also to consider the connections between
the readings, guest speakers, and tours of institutions. Students should also
relate the readings to their own internship experiences. All students are also
expected to enter into dialogues with guest speakers.

Each student will submit a brief (2-3 page) description of their community
history participation. This participation could include attending conference
sessions and/or volunteering in local museums. A number of opportunities will
be announced in class, and for those of you with special interests, special
activities can be arranged. For example, this fall the Eli Lilly Civil War
Museum is seeking speakers on various Civil War topics; the National
Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers= Board of Directors will
meet in Indianapolis on November 10-13; planning will be underway for the
annual meetings of the American Association for State and Local History which
will meet in Indianapolis in September of 2001 and the Midwest Archives
Conference will also meet in Indianapolis in the fall of 2001\. Our public
history graduate students have been asked to create exhibits for the Morris-
Butler House and the Indiana Medical History Museum for the AASLH meeting in
2001. Both of these institutions will also train public history students to
give tours of the museums, especially for school and scout groups. Public
history students have also agreed to prepare new exhibits for the glass
exhibit case on the 2nd floor in Cavanaugh Hall. Students are also expected to
participate in the Indiana University O=Brien Conference on Historic
Preservation (October 13-14 in French Lick, IN), the Association of Midwest
Museums conference in Columbus, Ohio October 4-7, 2000, the local chapter of
the Society of Architectural Historians (meets 3rd Thursdays each month), the
Marion County Historical Society, and the Indiana Historical Society. A list
of activities will be provided early in the fall.

I will look for evidence that you have actively worked to promote history
enterprises in the local community. There is no set number of required
activities because quality of participation is as important as quantity. I
will be attending most of the likely activities myself, as will Bob Barrows,
and we will be pleased to introduce you to our (and your) colleagues.

_

Issue paper_ (due Dec. 4): each student will select an important and
contemporary issue in public history and prepare a ten-page paper discussing
the context of the issue. Students should consider the history of the issue,
public policies relating to it, possible approaches to resolving the issue,
and your forecast of what will be the eventual outcome. Essays should be
carefully organized, present various points of view objectively, predict the
outcome, and persuade the reader that the issue has been thoroughly addressed
and that the opinions stated are to be valued. Papers should include footnotes
(or endnotes) and provide a complete bibliography. Topics should be chosen
with the advice and consent of the instructor by November 13.

**COURSE OBJECTIVE** : I strongly believe in and uphold the ethics of learner-
centered education. This means students are the primary agents of learning and
must take initiative as well as risks when entering unknown territory.
Education is about intellectual development; it has intrinsic moral value and
is not a "product" to be bought or consumed. Learning and teaching demand
courage because we confront new challenges and difficult situations. If we are
honest in our efforts, we will discover our strengths and weaknesses, and
ultimately this process will result in personal growth-our true goal. The
purpose of this specific course is to define and analyze historical patterns
on the largest possible scale, that of the entire world. The basic assumption
is that however great the diversity among societies, the human experience
includes elements common to all places and times. A dominant characteristic of
the period from 1500 to the present is the gradual integration of the world
into a global system. Until about World War II, this system was European-
dominated, because Western Europe was the first area to industrialize. But we
will see that societies outside Europe were not merely passive victims of
European imperialism. By spending a significant portion of the course on Asian
civilizations, we will learn that they had their own dynamics and impact on
world history. The **primary objective** of the course is to help students
arrive at their _own_ interpretation of modern history as a way of reaching a
personal understanding of the world in which we live. To achieve this goal,
students will be **expected** to develop and apply several important skills,
resulting in these **course outcomes** :  
    1\. Become familiar with a body of historical knowledge (content) through reading, writing, and study.   
    2\. Think critically about and analyze historical forces that shaped the past and still influence our lives today.   
    3\. Demonstrate an ability to discuss historical ideas and theories, and form arguments about their historical significance,   
        using clear oral and written communication. 

**REQUIRED READING:** Please purchase the following books.  
1\. John McKay, et. al., _A History of World Societies, vol. II, since 1500_ ,
5th ed., 2000.  
2\. Kevin Reilly, _Worlds of History: A Comparative Reader, vol. 2, since
1400_ , 2000.  
3\. Also purchase at least 3 Exam Books in the Book Store, you need at least 1
for each exam.

**EXAMINATIONS:** (Please refer to the COURSE SCHEDULE) There will be 2
Midterm Exams valued at 100 pts., and 1 Final Exam also valued at 100 pts.
Each exam covers the unit of the course that immediately precedes it (e.g.,
Midterm Exam I covers Unit 1). **There will be no make-ups or early exams for
the Final, except as allowed by the Dean.** All exams will include material
from the required readings, course handouts, discussions, lectures, and
videos, and will consist of objective questions, short answer questions, and
essay answer questions. Buy **exam books** ("blue books") at the Book Store
and bring a new one to all exams; they cost twenty cents each. **MAP QUIZ:**
There will be a quiz on Monday, Jan. 28th; you will receive a study map for
this (20 pts.).

**IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS (QUIZZES) :** Student learning requires that they
actively participate in the learning process, thus **Fridays the primary
format of this course will be discussion.** This will demand the participation
of every student, and all students will be **expected to prepare** for these
classes. To facilitate this process, **every Friday except Jan. 18 th and when
exams are scheduled, **there will be a written assignment (quiz) over the
**required weekly readings,** (assigned from Reilly, _Worlds of History,_ and
McKay, _History of World Societies_ ) during the first 10-15 minutes of class
(SEE THE COURSE SCHEDULE). The format of these assignments will vary: mini-
essays about the content of the readings, identifications from the readings,
multiple choice questions, a paragraph on the significance of an event from
the readings, etc. There will be a total of 13 in-class assignments valued at
10 pts. each. The maximum total for the semester on these assignments will be
100 pts., which means there will be a 30 pt. "cushion" to allow for low scores
on a "bad day," for missed classes, and for **_Extra Points_**.

**COLLABORATIVE LEARNING GROUPS:** The remainder of the period on Fridays will
be a **Collaborative** **Discussion Class** that will cover the assigned
readings from Reilly, _Worlds of History_ for that week. Collaborative
learning groups will be formed randomly on the first discussion day of the
semester, and each week groups will address historical issues and questions
from the readings in writing (10 pts. each week); each group will be
responsible for ensuring that each of its members makes a contribution to the
work. Students will be graded on their participation in the group discussions
and contributions to the writing assignments, **_and_** their participation in
the general class discussions that accompany the group work on the assigned
days. The maximum total for the semester on these assignments will be 100
pts., which means there will be a 30 pt. "cushion" to allow for missed
classes, and for **_Extra Points_**. The goal of all the in-class work is to
help you make slow, but steady progress during the semester in achieving the
course objectives outlined above. **I will be looking for progress, not
perfection. NO MAKEUPS WILL BE ALLOWED FOR THE IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENTS OR THE
COLLABORATIVE LEARNING GROUPS, NO EXCEPTIONS**.

**INDIVIDUAL RESEARCH PROJECT:** In order to pass this course, each student
must complete a research project as specified in this syllabus and in a
**[Format
Guide](http://faculty.pittstate.edu/~ckeller/ProjectGuide.SP2002.html)** to be
distributed in class in a couple of weeks. This project will be valued at 100
pts. and will be due on Friday, April 5 th. The individual research project
will be a historical paper, at least 3 pages long (standard margins, double
spacing), that **compares and contrasts the reigns of two important,
contemporary monarchs** from the seventeenth-eighteenth centuries that the
student will select from the following list. The paper **_must be properly
documented_** with citations to the appropriate sources of information. Papers
will be accepted early and on the due day until 5:00 p.m., **_BUT LATE PAPERS
WILL BE PENALIZED 10 POINTS PER DAY LATE_** (for example, a paper earning 85
points handed in after 5:00 p.m. on the due day but before 24 hours pass will
be given a 75). **NOTE:** **I will gladly help you with your research projects
if you ask me for help early, before you have to turn in your paper. This
includes reading your rough draft and providing comments on how you may
improve your paper.** The monarchs from which you will choose your subjects
are:

1\. The Kangxi Emperor (r. 1662-1722, China)                             5\.
Aurangzeb (r. 1658-1707, India)  
2\. Louis XIV (r. 1643-1715, France)
6\. Peter the Great (r. 1682-1725, Russia)  
3\. William and Mary (r. 1689-1702, England)                               7\.
Frederick William (r. 1640-1688, Prussia)  
4\. Shah Abbas (r. 1587-1629, Persia)
8\. Tokugawa Ieyasu (r. 1600-1616, Japan)

**FINAL EVALUATION** : Final semester grade calculation:

2 midterm exams X 100 pts. ea. = 200 pts.                                   A
= 700-630  
1 final exam         X 100             = 100
B = 629-560  
collaborative discussion groups   = 100
C = 559-490  
in-class assignments                    = 100
D = 489-420  
individual research project          = 100  
participation points                     =   80  
1 map quiz           X 20              =   _20_  
                                                    700 

**ATTENDANCE, PARTICIPATION, and MAKEUP POLICY:** Participation means in-class
speaking, in-class activities, and active, responsive listening. Participation
is a crucial element in this class. It includes in-class activities and
discussions. Simply showing up for class does not by itself constitute
participation. You are expected to present your informed ideas as well as to
listen and show respect for the others in the classroom. **Participation is
mental attendance in the course**. You will be graded on how much you
contribute to the learning environment of the class; if you do not add
anything to the class, then you will not receive a good participation grade.
This means several things: **(1)** not attending class physically will not
help your participation grade; **(2)** contributing to discussions can only
help your grade in this class; if you do not talk, then you are adding nothing
useful to the discussions; **(3)** simply repeating what the person before you
has said, with no new insights, does not add anything to the discussions;
**(4)** interrupting someone else, talking while others are talking, talking
during videos, sleeping, showing disrespect to others, showing up late to
class, etc., does not contribute to the class. Because this behavior is a
hindrance to other students' learning, it will be penalized. **Repeated
behavior that has a negative effect on the learning of the class will result
in dismissal from the class. Repeated tardiness** will negatively affect your
participation grade. You cannot fully participate in the class if you
frequently miss part of class sessions, and you are disrupting the flow of the
class as a whole when you come in late. Therefore, even if you actively
participate in class discussions when you are in class, your participation
grade will suffer if you are chronically late. Attendance will be recorded
daily. There will be **_no make-ups_** for the collaborative learning group
assignments or the in-class assignments (quizzes). Make-ups for the Midterm
exams will only be considered if I am given **_advance notice_** that you will
miss the exam, and provided with **_acceptable written documentation_**
explaining the emergency and why you missed the exam.

**ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:** Cheating of any kind will be prosecuted according to
the University's guidelines and could result in an F for the course or
dismissal from the University. Review page 36 in PSU, _2001-2003 University
Catalog_ and be absolutely sure you understand and comply with these
guidelines.

**PLEASE NOTE:** Any student who has a disability that prevents the fullest
expression of abilities should contact me as soon as possible to discuss class
requirements and possible accommodations. Also see PSU, _2001-2003 University
Catalog_ , pg. 23-24. As the instructor for this course, I reserve the right
to alter this syllabus if required; you will be notified in writing if this
occurs.

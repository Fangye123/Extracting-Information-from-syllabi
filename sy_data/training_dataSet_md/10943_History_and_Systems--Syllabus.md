**Important Dates**

> 09/16 Last day to withdraw without record.  
>  11/13 Last day to withdraw with **W**.

**Course Requirements/Grading Policies**

> The course grade is based on four short-answer exams--each covering a
different portion of the course--and a research paper. Each exam and the paper
is scored on a 100-point scale and a weighted average (see schedule) is
computed in order to determine your final grade: 91-100 (A), 87-90 (A-), 84-86
(B+), 81-83 (B), 77-80 (B-), 71-76 (C), <71 (F).

**Attendance Policy and Responsibility**

> Please inform me by e-mail if you wish to be excused from a class. I will
permit up to two unexcused absences; any more will affect your course average.
You are expected to take all exams and submit assigned written material _on
the scheduled dates._ If this does not occur (e.g., in the case of an
emergency), you must petition in writing to make up the exam(s) or
assignment(s). Any make-up is counted as late; hence, stricter grading
criteria will be applied.

**Academic Dishonesty Policy**

> Academic dishonesty is defined as any attempt by a student to obtain, or to
assist another student to obtain, a grade higher than honestly earned. An
occurrence of academic dishonesty (e.g., cheating, plagiarism, grade
alteration, deception) will result, minimally, in the student's failing the
test or assignment.

**Students with Special Needs**

> Test-taking and note-taking accommodations will be arranged for students who
need them. If you have special needs, please inform me as soon as possible.

**Course/Instructor Evaluation**

> On a class day near the end of the semester, you will be asked to complete
(anonymously) the University's "Course Evaluation Form." The results are
confidential; only the Department Chairperson and the Instructor are permitted
to see the results--and only after the final grades have been submitted.
Please treat the evaluation seriously. Your opinions are extremely important
to us.

**Caveat**

> Although you should consider the information provided on this syllabus as
accurate, changes in dates, assignments, and policies are sometimes necessary.

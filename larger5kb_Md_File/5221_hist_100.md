**Course Requirements:**

Two Tests:   September 20-22  
             November 1-3   
Eight regular quizzes  
Two map quizzes  
One quiz on the reading in Edith Hamilton's Mythology  
Final examination (not comprehensive)

**Grading:  ** Your final grade in the course will be determined as follows:
each test will count as one-fourth and the final examination will count as
one-fourth. The remaining fourth will consist of the weekly quizzes, map
quizzes (each counts as three regular quizzes), and  the mythology quiz
(counts as five regular quizzes).  The combined quiz grade will constitute
fifteen  
percent (15%) of the final grade, and it will be added to the ten percent
(10%) grade for professional development [class attendance, promptness in
getting to class, attentiveness, classroom manners], to make up the final
quarter of your course grade.

**Attendance Policy** :  Students will find it exceedingly difficult to
succeed in this class unless they attend with regularity.  However, your
instructor does not believe in artificially penalizing students by lowering
grades for failing to attend classes.  On the other hand, I begin classes
promptly and have no patience with students who are tardy.  **I therefore
reserve the right to deduct points from the final grade of a student who comes
late to class, or who lacks proper classroom manners**.   Also I have a closed
mind on absences from tests.  Make-ups will be given only when students can
show a valid reason for the absence.  In some cases students may be required
to write an additional research paper in addition to taking a make-up test.

Honor Code:  Students are expected to comply with the honor code on all work
for the course.

**Research Essay for the Final Examination:**

Students are required to write a research essay of about three (3) pages to be
handed in on the day of the final examination.  This research essay will count
as fifteen percent (15%) of the final examination grade.  The topic for the
essay must be a prominent figure in European (not American)  art,
architecture, religion, philosophy, literature, music, science, technology or
society in the period from the beginning of the Western world until 1648..  At
least three (3) sources must be used in the essay, and no more than one of
them can be an electronic document.  No encyclopedias, textbooks, or class-
notes may be cited!  As the information is from scholarly sources, each work
must be properly cited in your essay.  NO PARENTHETICAL OR TEXT NOTES MAY BE
USED!  Only footnotes are permitted!

  The paper must be typed on a word-processor or computer.  Please be certain
that the ribbon you use is new or nearly so.

Papers with more than ten grammatical errors will receive a failing grade.
Please review your paper carefully for such errors before submitting it for a
grade!

At the close of the syllabus are examples of models that you may use for your
footnotes: (SEE PAGE 12-13 OF THE SYLLABUS!!)  
    


Students should learn the proper use of "it's" and "its". Students who misuse
the two properly will be penalized.

"An educated man must have a certain minimum of general knowledge.  Even if he
knows little about science and cannot add or subtract, he must have heard of
Mendel and Kepler.  Even if he is tone deaf he must know something about
Debussy and Verdi; even if he is a pure sociologist he must be aware of Circe
and the Minotaur, of Kant and Montaign, of Titus Oates and Tiberius Gracchus."  
      Robert Conquest   
    
    
    
    
    


The following are useful examples of models for the footnotes in your research
essays:

Footnoting a book:  
       l   
        Arthur Waley, The Analects of Confucius (London: George Allen and Unwin, l938), 33. 

If the same work by Waley is used again for the second footnote, Ibid should
be used.  Thus,  
       2   
        Ibid., 37.   (Note that Ibid is not underlined)   
 If Waley is cited later, after other works have been cited, students should
use a short title.  Thus,

       l7   
         Waley, The Analects, 130\. 

Footnoting a multi-volume work:  
       3

PLAGIARISM:  Students should be reminded that the use of an author's ideas in
a student paper without giving proper credit to the author constitutes
plagiarism.  Likewise the use of an author's words without placing those words
in quotation marks and providing proper citation is plagiarism.  Students
sometimes believe that by changing an occasional word or two or even three in
a sentence or paragraph, they are avoiding plagiarism.  This is not the case!
The information and ideas taken from a source must be re-formed into your own
words!  And after re-forming it into your own words, you must use a footnote
or endnote giving proper credit to the author.

If your instructor suspects intentional or unintentional plagiarism, your
paper will be returned ungraded and you will be asked to bring your sources to
his office to verify the  
scholarship.

# Syllabus

**Description**

This course introduces main themes in the history of the United States from
the Civil War to the present. Not only will we be studying the actions of
presidents and important people, but we will also look at how common people
lived and acted. We will compare the different experiences of various ethnic,
religious, and racial groups, social classes, and women. An intent of this
course is to introduce the concepts, materials, and tools employed in the
discipline of history, and to help develop writing and other skills used in
the study of history. By the end of the course you should have developed your
ability to think clearly and critically, to ask and research significant
questions, to read historical materials intelligently, and to express your
ideas in a logical, concise manner.

**Requirements**

You are expected and required to attend every class session, and you are
responsible for the material covered in the lectures, readings and films, and
for any announcements made in class. Unexcused absences will negatively affect
your grade. If you have a disability or any conflicts which may affect your
class performance, please bring this to my attention immediately so that we
can make arrangements for this to be a positive learning experience for you.

**Readings**

There are three required books for this class. You may either purchase them at
campus bookstores or read them at the reserve desk in Milner Library. Read the
assignments before class so that you are prepared to carry on an intelligent
discussion of the material in class.

Mary Beth Norton, et al., _A People and a Nation: A History of the United
States; Volume II: Since 1865_ (4 th ed., 1994)  
Upton Sinclair, _The Jungle_  
Anne Moody, _Coming of Age in Mississippi_

**Internet**

This course makes use of a web site
([http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist136](http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist127)) and
[Netforum class discussions group](http://www.ilstu.edu/cgi-
bin/netforum/hist136/a/1) on the Internet to extend the scope of the class
beyond that of the immediate classroom setting. Class schedule updates,
lecture outlines, additional information on assignments, and other information
related to the class will be posted to the web site. The newsgroup is designed
for the posting of announcements, a forum to ask questions, continue class
discussions, complain about the weather, etc. You are expected and encouraged
to make active use of these resources. ISU provides students with free email
accounts and access to computer terminals in labs around campus. Let me know
at the beginning of the semester if access to these resources will be a
problem for you.

**Assignments and grades**

Course grades will be based on two exams and two written essays. Each of these
assignments will count toward twenty-five percent of your final grade. Grades
on late assignments will be penalized one-half of a letter grade for each day
that they are late. Study guides for each of the exams and more detailed
information on the written essays will be posted to the web page. Use the
[Netforum class discussions group](http://www.ilstu.edu/cgi-
bin/netforum/hist136/a/1) to discuss these assignments with your classmates in
a relaxed and informal virtual discussion session.

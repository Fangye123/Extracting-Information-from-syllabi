_Catalog Description:_  

Psychological research and theory in human learning and development related to
the educational processes.  

_Course Goals & Objectives:_  

_Goal 1.0_ To enable students to develop a _critical understanding_ of the
major theoretical perspectives: Humanism, Behaviorism, Cognitive Psychology,
Critical Pedagogy - including the theorists behind these perspectives:
Skinner, Rogers, Maslow, Bruner, Ausabel, Freire, Vygotsky, etc.  

_Goal 2.0_ To engage students in a _critical exploration_ of the major subject
area within the Psychological Foundations of Education including: various
perspectives on the learning process, alternative model of teaching - learning
transition, significant theories regarding the human development process -
cognitive, social and moral.  

_Goal 3.0_ To engage students in a _critical exploration_ of some key concepts
involved in understanding the psychological dimension of teaching, learning
and the educational process, including the concepts of intelligence,
creativity, motivation, communication theory, group dynamics, human relations
theory, etc.  

* * *

_Course Requirements:_  

1\. Regular attendance in class and participation in class discussions and
activities.

_Grading procedure:_  

This course is divided into examinations, specific assignments on the computer
and seminar presentations. The student's evaluation will be based on
individually written assignments, examination scores (completely from the
readings), participation in class activities, and any extra credit announced
in class. Extra credit will be limited to **two** assignments, worth 10 points
each. Completing the above projects and student productions earn points
towards the following grades: 90% of possible points for an A, 80% for a B,
70% for a C, 60% for a D, and below 60% a failing grade.  

**Point Structure**  
  
---  
Daily participation in group discussions 5 points each x 10 = 50 points
possible  
Assigned work sheets 5 points each x 10 = 50 points possible  
Exams 20 points each x 5 = 100 points possible

Group Case Studies 20 points each x 5 = 100 points possible  
  
Attendance for **entire class period** 5 points x 10 = 50 points possible  
email to professor (background and bio) 10 points  
[ERIC ](http://edrs.com/cgi-bin/askERIC)written summary 10 points  
Extra Credit in consultation with professor up to a maximum of 20 points  
**Total points possible = 370** (does not include extra credit, 243 needed for
an A). Please note that to receivce an "A" you must average 90% on all group
and individual assignments.  
  


Please note **that there will be no make ups of the exam.** Should you be ill
or have to miss because of a **legitimate** and **authorized** emergency, you
will be will need to make separate arrangements with the professor. **_Extra
credit must be handed in no later than the fourth week in order to get the
allowed points._**

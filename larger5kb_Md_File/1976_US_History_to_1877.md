**Required Text:** Roark, James L. and Michael P. Johnson, et. al, _The

[Note Taking and Study Skills](http://www.wmich.edu/asc/note-taking.html)

**Description:** This is a lecture course that will cover United States
history from the conquest of Constantinople in 1453 to the end of the
Reconstruction in 1877. Three groups coalesced in the Americas in the wake of
1453: indigeneous peoples, Europeans, and Africans. We will concentrate on the
portion of North America that became the United States of America in 1783. In
that region, as in others, European conquest brought the three groups into a
global market economy based first on mercantilism then on capitalism. How
these individuals reshaped their identities and negotiated their social status
to maximize their economic opportunities constitutes the history of the United
States.

**Requirements:** You must read and outline all reading assignments, take
notes at all lectures, and come prepared to each class. Notetaking is a
critical skill. The link, "Note Taking and Study Skills" will provide you with
help, as will the "Note Taking" link listed in the Week 01 assignment. If you
need more help, contact the Student Success Center in Mary Martin Hall.

The Class Schedule below lists the weekly readings. Have it done by the Monday
of the week for which it is assigned. You should first read the textbook then
the primary source documents in the order listed. These are only available
online. If you have any problems accessing the computer-based resources,
consult the "Survival Guide" a newspaper format brochure on computing at
Auburn, stacked at the entrances of most buildings. You can also ask the staff
at the library or to Auburn's Information Technology (IT) center. Computer
literacy is a university-wide requirement.

**Writing Assignments and Exams** : You will turn in a writing assignment
nearly once a week. [This link](assignments.html) will give you the
guidelines. You will have a midterm and final. There will be no multiple-
choice questions. All questions will consist of identifications, short-
answers, and essays. They will be graded on the basis of content,
organization, and grammar. I will always provide an online study guide for
exams. For any credit on any assignment or exam, answers must be in complete
sentences with appropriate punctuation. Answers not in sentences will receive
no credit regardless of content. This is to train you to construct thoughtful,
contextual answers.

**Make-up Policy** : _Writing Assignments_ : It is your responsibility to
arrange for make-up work within one week of a valid absence. You'll find
Auburn's policy in [Tiger Cub](http://www.auburn.edu/tigercub/rules). If you
have a valid excuse and present it within the week of the absence then you can
make up a writing assignment. The make-up will consist of a textual analysis
of a primary source document not on the syllabus. _Exam_ : The Midterm make-up
will consist of a blue book essay that will require synthesis and analysis of
lectures, reading, and primary documents. It will take place only on Dead Day.
_Final_ : I administer no early finals.

**Grading:** Your grade is based on a 100-point scale. You will accumulate
points from the following: Writing Assignments = 40; Midterm = 25; Final = 35
for a total of 100 points.

**Academic Honesty:** You will find Auburn University's policy on academic
dishonesty in the Tiger Cub link above. I will reported any suspected offences
directly to the Academic Honesty Committee.

**Students with Disabilities:** Student must contact the Student Disabilities
Office, 1232 Haley Center, and bring me the appropriate documentation. We will
then discuss classroom accomodations.

**E-Mail** : There will be situations in which I may have to e-mail the class
so it is essential that you have activated your account. If you use an
independent ISP (Internet Service Provider), then you must put a .forward file
in the root directory of your university account. This is easy to do and the
_Survival Guide_ tells you how. If you still can't do it, go to the IT office
and they will do it for you. The .forward file will automatically forward any
email to whatever account you prefer to use. If you don't do this, you will
still be held responsible for whatever information I send.

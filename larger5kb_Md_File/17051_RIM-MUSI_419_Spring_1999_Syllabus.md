**Office Hours:**   Monday 2:00 \- 5:00 p.m., Wednesday, Friday 11:00 a.m. -
1:00 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday 8:00 - 9:30 a.m.  Additionally, I am often
here either in the Recording Studios, the MIDI Lab, or the Post Production
Lab.

**Texts:**

The Secrets of Analog & Digital Synthesis, 1986, Steve DeFuria $16.95

MIDI for Musicians, 1986, Craig Anderton $17.95

Principles and Practices of Electronic Music Manual, Ver. 1.3 $14.70

**Supplies:**   5) 3.5 Inch High Density Computer Diskettes @$1.00      1) DAT
tape (16 minutes) -- $11.00

**Purpose:** RIM/MUSI 419 provides an introduction to three primary areas of
current music technology: music synthesis, MIDI, and sequencing. The synthesis
component includes study of the history of electronic music, basic principles
of music synthesis, and hands-on application of those principles to digital
synthesizers. A thorough discussion of MIDI, MIDI message types, and their
implementation in our lab constitute the MIDI segment of the course. Basic
sequencing concepts are introduced and demonstrated using Performer sequencing
software. At the completion of the course the student will know how to design
a simple MIDI setup and physically connect the equipment. The theoretical
knowledge of the basic concepts of synthesis will provide the student with a
strong foundation for the exploration and understanding of the basic operation
of many other synthesizers. The student will have a working knowledge of basic
sequencer functions applicable to any sequencer.

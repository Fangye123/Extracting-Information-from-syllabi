**LECTURES:**  
Monday 9 a.m.-noon. Fisk  #309

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**  

This course examines current broadcast issues with emphasis on the
implications for the television journalist. The topics we will discuss
include: the role of the television journalist in a democracy, ratings and the
economics of the broadcast industry, federal regulations and the Federal
Communication Commission, changes in local TV news and network TV news,
ethical decision making and assaults on television journalism standards, and
diversity in the media.

The course consists of one three-hour lecture/discussion a week. You will be
given a packet of readings each week to compliment the discussions for the
following week. In addition, you are encouraged to read broadcast trade
publications, which can be found in the Reading Room, Fisk Hall. The library
has several excellent periodicals including, _American Journalism Review_
(AJR), _Columbia Journalism Review_ (CJR), _Electronic Media_ , _Broadcasting
& Cable_, and _Communicator_ (published by the Radio Television News
Directors' Association). Students are also required to read daily the _New
York Times_ , _The Wall Street Journal_ , the _Chicago Tribune_ and the
_Chicago Sun-Times_ (including the media columns such as Robert Feder in the
_Sun Times_ ).

You are also encouraged to read about media issues on the web. Some suggested
media sites include: rtnda.org (Radio Television News Directors' Association),
journalism.org (Project for Excellence in Journalism), poynter.org (The
Poynter Institute for media studies) and TVSpy.com (postings about television
news).

You should watch television news daily and listen to radio news daily.
Following the news should become second nature. You are encouraged to bring to
class examples relating to the assigned topic from current events and/or
current news programs for discussion. The course outline will be modified to
reflect significant journalism issues that break during the quarter.

You will be required to write two papers for this course. The first paper is
an analysis of a network television news program (one night). You have two
options for the second paper. One is an analysis of the 10p.m. news on one
local Chicago television station for three consecutive nights. The second is
an analysis of a breaking news story and the television news coverage.
Detailed descriptions of the papers are attached.

**PAPER #2: OPTION #1 - LOCAL NEWS ANALYSIS  
****DUE: November 19, 2001**

Watch the 10P.M. News on the same Chicago television station for three
consecutive weekday nights from November 5-9, 2001. The news on the three
network owned stations (WLS/Ch7, WMAQ/Ch5, & WBBM/Ch2) runs from 10-10:35p.m.
Do not record the weekend news.  
**NOTE: Check your tape to make sure you recorded the news program in its
entirety.**

Log the three news programs for content using the attached form. (Turn in the
logs with your paper.) In addition to your logs, you may want to design a
research tool that will help with your analysis. For example, you may want to
classify stories by specific categories to help you determine the extent of
coverage of specific issues.

Critique and analyze the 10 p.m. news produced by one of the local Chicago
television stations. Focus on the broadcast issues from class discussions and
handouts. Support your arguments with (1) examples from the news programs you
logged and (2) references from class readings and guest lecturers. (One
suggestion: save copies of The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune from the
week you studied to use as a database for potential news stories available
during the research period.) Also consider using comments and quotes from the
Monday lecture series to support your arguments.

**THIS IS AN ACADEMIC PAPER.** Your first paragraph should explain the thesis
of your paper and your method of analysis. The following paragraphs should
present the evidence to support your thesis. End with a strong conclusion
paragraph. (Do not write in broadcast style and do not write only a few
sentences per paragraph. Each paragraph should fully develop one key point.)

Papers will be judged on the intellectual depth of the arguments presented.
Limit your paper to no more than **six** pages **DOUBLE-SPACED**.

**TURN IN TWO COPIES OF YOUR PAPER (including two copies of the logs) AND A
VHS COPY OF THE NEWS PROGRAM YOU ANALYZED.** (One copy of your paper will be
retained in my class files. Your videotape will be returned with your graded
paper.)

**PAPER #2: OPTION #2 - "THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CAMERA"  
DUE: November 19, 2001**

Analyze a breaking news story and the television news coverage. Emphasize two
perspectives: (1) the reporter and (2) the person interviewed by a television
news reporter. Your paper should include the techniques and methods the
reporter used to present the story, and the reaction of the interviewee
suddenly thrust into the limelight.

Select a television news story that aired on the network news or local news
that meets the following criteria:  
1\. story appeared in the last year  
2\. story involved someone who is NOT a traditional newsmaker (not a
politician, actress, or public figure)

Interview this "average citizen" suddenly thrust in front of the television
news cameras. Ask about the final edited report. Was it accurate? Was it
complete? Were any key facts left out? In addition, ask about the experience
of facing a television microphone in a stressful situation.

Remember to include key points from the lectures that may apply.

Interview at least one reporter (two if possible) who interviewed this
"average citizen." Cover all the points you asked in your original interview.
Include any criticisms, as well as positive points. IF you absolutely cannot
interview any of the television reporters (they are under severe daily
deadlines and all calls to them should be made in the morning), interview a
news producer or executive who can give the station's position on the issues
brought up in your interview with the "instant newsmaker."

Select your subjects early to give yourself sufficient time to conduct the
interviews. I recommend you tape record all interviews.

Turn in your notes for all interviews with your paper. (If you taped your
interviews, you may turn in the audiocassette instead of notes.)

HINT: If you are having trouble selecting a story, consider a breaking story
you have covered in your reporting class.

Write a thoughtful analysis of the breaking story you selected, emphasizing
the viewpoints of the "newsmaker" and the news reporters. Include issues
discussed throughout the quarter in the lectures and discussions. You will be
graded on the intellectual insight you demonstrate and the depth of knowledge
about the key issues. You should include key quotes and information from your
interviews. However, your paper should be more than a summary of your
interviews. Using other source material, write an academic paper that reflects
your depth of understanding about the issues key to the story you studied.

**NOTE: THIS ASSIGNMENT IS AN ACADEMIC PAPER, NOT A JOURNALISM ARTICLE. YOUR
PAPER SHOULD INCLUDE FOOTNOTES AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY.**

Your paper should be no longer than **six** pages **DOUBLE SPACED**.

##  Objectives:

As citizens of the global community, it is vital that each of us do our part
to improve the world. This can only be done as we understand our world and its
inhabitants. Geography is one of many perspectives for looking at this; it
allows us to see the similarities, differences, and interrelationships between
different groups and regions, and develop strategies for dealing with these in
a positive way. The purpose of this course will be to introduce you to the
principles of Geography, and to expand your understanding of the World: its
people and their environment. We will look at each of the major world regions
as three interrelated aspects--physical environment, culture, and economic
development--in the context of current events. It is hoped that through this
course, you will be able to better grasp the complex system that is our world,
and realize your role in it.

##  Required Texts:

  * Rowntree, L, et al, 2000, _Diversity amid Globalization: World Regions, Environment, Development_.
    * The companion website to the book, [ http://www.prenhall.com/rowntree](http://www.prenhall.com/rowntree) , has some excellent study aids you should try.  The CD also has excellent study aids.
  * _Goode's World Atlas_. Rand McNally.   This is not an absolute requirement, but is strongly encouraged (you should always have an atlas :-)
  * Map Packet, which can be purchased in the Geography Office (690 SWKT) for $0.15
  * There is also an optional map packet ($2.00, I believe) with several copies of blank maps for taking class notes.

##  Requirements:

  1. **Quizzes:** There will be a brief quiz at the beginning of class each day. Each will have 15 questions: 7 based on the previous class's lectures, 3 on the required readings for the current day (focus on the Key Terms and the Summary Questions at the end of the chapter, and the sample questions on the website), and 5 on map locations. The lowest quiz score (or one missed quiz) will be dropped. _15 pts, 13 quizzes-1: **180 possible points**_
  2. **[Essay Assignments](exercises.htm) :** For each region, there will be a question given for you to think and write about as you read the assigned chapters.   On the next class period, you will hand in a 2 page (double-spaced typed) essay answering the question, using your book, atlas, and other sources.  The essay should be well-organized and well-written (i.e., you will be graded for your English). _20 pts, 7 Essays: **140 possible points**_
  3. **Final Exam (Mon Dec 17, 5:45-7:45pm):** The final exam will be comprehensive, covering mostly the lectures, but also some from the book. About half the questions will come from the quizzes. There will also be a map portion, in which you will need to identify countries or major features that were discussed in class. **_115 possible points_**

**Grading** will be according to the normal breakdown (93%+: A, 90-93 A-,
87-90 B+, etc.).

##  Policies:

  * **Extra Credit** : There are "Thinking Geographically" questions at the end of each chapter.  You can answer the set of questions (about a paragraph each) for up two chapters for extra credit .  Another option is to do the "Web Essays" on the textbook website for up to two chapters (print them out and hand them in, don't submit them online) (5 pts each, 10 points total possible)
  * **Late Work** : You can hand the assignments up to two weeks late, but points will be docked.  Quizzes may not be taken late unless previously excused (See below)
  * **Missing Class** :  There are no points for attendance, but if you miss a class, you will miss a quiz, as well as lecture notes for the next week's quiz.  If you plan to be gone, you **must** talk to me before you leave to arrange things (I'll let you hand in work and take quizzes early).   If you miss for an unforeseen reason (e.g. illness), contact me (or have someone else contact me) as soon as possible to explain.  I am forgiving, but I will not fill out withdrawal slips three months after you disappear, or do makeup quizzes three weeks after you get back.
  * **Academic Dishonesty** : in accordance with university policy, I will give a 0 on any work in which I catch you cheating.  Several points will be docked from your assignments for even mild cases of plagiarism, so always cite your sources.

##  Schedule:

For reading assignments, letters next to chapters indicate the section:

and Diversity, G=Geopolitical Framework, S=Economic and Social Development.
For quiz map locations, refer to the map at the beginning of the assigned
chapters, studying either the countries, the major cities (>1M), or the

1\. _BROAD PURPOSE OF COURSE  
  
_ This course examines the history of the ancient world (i.e. in the West),
from the first Mesopotamian civilizations to the fall of the Roman Empire. The
focus will be on Classical Antiquity--Greece and Rome--but we will strive to
include many other ancient Eurasian civilizations, like the Scythians and the
Celts.  
  
2\. _COURSE OBJECTIVES  
  
_ Upon successful completion of this course students will be expected to
identify major themes, ideas, persons, and events in ancient history. Students
will be expected to communicate their understanding of these both orally and
through written essays, as well as in research assignments.  
  
3\. _TEACHING METHOD  
  
_ The textbooks provide a good historical narrative that is essential for
understanding the periods covered by the exams. You will be lost in class if
you do not do your textbook reading assignments. Lectures will seldom cover
the same material as the text, but rather offer a more detailed perspective on
certain significant figures and themes. These figures and themes will also
feature prominently on the objective portion of the exams. Class participation
is essential, for discussion of the history of cultures and ideas will enhance
your understanding of antiquity. To facilitate class discussion, you will be
assigned periodically readings from both primary and secondary sources, which
will feature prominently on the essay portion of the exams.  
  
4\. _GRADING POLICY  
  
_ Course grading is based on attendance and participation (10%); one 8-10 page
historiographic paper (20%); one mid-term exam (20%); one research project
(20%); and a final exam (30%). An historiographic paper is not a standard
research paper, with a thesis and argument, but rather a broad survey of all
the literature on a given topic (for a full definition, see Brundage, _Going
to the Sources_ , ch. 4). The research project is actually creating an object
from the material culture of an ancient civilization using
descriptions/directions in primary sources.  
  
Make-up exams are permitted only in the event of verifiable illness or death
in the family. Please take advantage of visiting the instructor during the
office hours listed above. You can leave messages for me with both voice mail
and e-mail.

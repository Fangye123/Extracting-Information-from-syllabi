###  Syllabus



**_Prerequisites**_

The prerequisite for this course is MIS325 (Introduction to Database) and a
desire to learn J Some programming background is desirable or find someone in
class with programming experience who can partner with you.

**_Text and Reading Material**_

The area of database systems has grown tremendously in the last few years. I
am not aware of any database book that covers all the topics of interest to us
(i.e., database concepts, Web-database connectivity, data warehouse and
Oracle). The only way I can cover such diverse and difficult subject is by
selecting many books. However, I have chosen one book that covers the database
basics very well.

**_Required Text**_

Thomas Connolly, Carolyn Begg and Anne Strachan. Database Systems - A
practical approach to Design, Implementation, and Management, Addison Wesley,
Second Edition.

I will make available my own notes on SQL, PL/SQL and web-database
connectivity (hopefully, these material will be part of my future book on
databases). Oracle documentation will also be made available to you as when
required.

**_Grading**_

Your course grade will be based on a curve. Not more than 30% of the class
will receive an "A." At least 10% of the class may receive a grade of "D" or
lower. The rest 60% of the class will receive either a B or a C. Cut-off for
the various grades will depend on the grade distribution. Please note that the
percentages stated here may be changed at the discretion of the professor
depending on the class performance. For instance, if the entire class performs
well then no one will receive a grade "D" or lower. Likewise, if too many
students do well then the percentages of A's and B's will increase. A grade of
X (incomplete) is very uncommon and will be given only for very unusual
circumstances as determined by me (medical emergencies to you or your
immediate family members that occur after the official drop date). You need to
provide sufficient evidence of the problem and notify me as soon as it occurs.
Since the grade is based on a curve, sharing your work with your friends will
hurt your grade in some way L.

The course grade will be decided based on the following:

|  Assignment (3) | 35%  
(10% + 15% + 15%) | Project | 25% | Mid-term Exam I | 25% | Mid-term Exam II |
10% | Quizzes/Class Participation | 5% |   |   | **Total | **100%

NOTE: This course cannot be taken for pass/fail since there is a significant
project component. If you plan to take this course, you must take this for
credit. Also, a student receiving an incomplete grade in the course is
required to complete such work by the end of the next academic session. If you
disagree with the points tally on any assignments/exam you need to submit a
short memo addressed to me within 5 (working) days of the time they are
received. This memo must state why the assigned points tally is incorrect. If
the error is a calculation error you can contact me immediately after the
class. If you disagree with the final course grade please contact me ASAP.

**_Class Participation**_

Every student is encouraged to participate in this class via the message board
and e-mail. Please share your experiences related to databases or systems
development. If you have an interesting article or news about databases (e.g.,
article on systems-related problems of e-brokerages reported in the Wall
Street Journal), please discuss this on the class message board or inform
class students by e-mail. If any student is interested in presenting an
important topic to the class please let me know. I will also provide a set of
topics that you can research on and discuss online (e.g., comparative study of
various commercial database systems, issues in e-brokerage design, benefits of
object-relational systems, Universal severs). Students will be suitably
rewarded for the efforts by way of extra-credit. Also, students can volunteer
to share some of the useful features of Oracle with other students through
self-made handouts.

**_Scholastic Dishonesty**_

Students who violate University rules on scholastic dishonesty are subject to
disciplinary penalties, including the possibility of failure in the course
and/or dismissal from the University. Please refer to the Student Judicial
Services Website at <http://www.utexas.edu/depts/dos/> or the General
Information Catalog to access the official University policies and procedures
on scholastic dishonesty. In this class, unless otherwise specified, all the
assignments must be done individually. You are free to seek help from the
professor or TA or any tutors. No one should share his/her code or program
logic with friends. However, you are free to seek help if you are confused
about the syntax or syntax errors. If you seek any help from your friends, you
must record their name and the type of help received from them. This
information must be provided along with the assignment submission.

**Course Description**

This upper division history course examines selected topics in early
twentieth-century U.S. history. The readings, documents, and other course
materials provide a window onto particular events, stresses, and issues of
this period. We'll keep an eye on the domestic ramifications of major
international events--World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II--,
consider the changing role of the state, trace the debate over "Americanism,"
examine political, economic and social protests, and explore the development
of consumer culture.

We will focus, however, on questions of race, class, and gender as mediated by
and through cultural expression. What marks the 1920s, 30s and 40s, according
to historian Warren Susman, is the emergence of "a new world of images and
sound." He is referring, in part, to the era's dramatic explosion of easy and
mass communications--radio, motion pictures, advertising, magazines--but also
to the transformation of United States society which accompanied and affected
this communications revolution.

**Notes on Computer Resources**

The 1990s communications revolution is of a different sort- centering on
computers and the internet. We'll take advantage of these newer forms of
technology in this course.

The Course Website (<http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kmorriss>) includes a copy of
the syllabus with related links.

As noted on the Course Outline below, various course readings (all the
articles and documents, but not the books) are located on-line--some on
Electronic Reserve, others at other sites on the internet. If you are
unfamiliar with using a course web page, locating a http address on the
internet, or following links, be sure to attend one of the internet workshops
available at the Main Library. (See schedule at
<http://www.library.arizona.edu/workshop.html>).  I will also offer an
optional class meeting to provide a basic internet introduction on FRIDAY,
August 27 at 11:00 a.m. in the SBSRI computer classroom, 224 Social Sciences
Building. Space is limited for this optional meeting, so sign up at class on
either Tuesday, August 24 or Thursday, August 26.

**Notes on Course Readings**

The Course Outline lists the **required** readings--books, articles, and
documents.

The following **books** are available for purchase at the ASUA Bookstore and
on reserve at the main library:

Michael C.C. Adams, _The Best War Ever: America and World War II_  
Alan Brinkley, _Voices of Protest: Huey Long, Father Coughlin and the Great
Depression_  
David J. Goldberg, _Discontented America: The United States in the 1920s_  
Ronald Schaffer, _America in the Great War_

The **articles** are located on Electronic Reserve; you can access them from
the Course Website, by clicking on their blue highlighted http addresses,
through the Main Library's reserve page at:
[(http://sabio.library.arizona.edu/screens/reserves.html](http://sabio.library.arizona.edu/screens/reserves.html))  
or through the POLIS Course Homesite at:  
_<http://www.u.arizona.edu/ic/polis/fall99/Course-Homesite.cgi?HIST_438_538>_
).  
Additionally, the articles are available for short-term checkout in the
Courses file cabinet in 215 Social Sciences, Department of History. Some of
the articles, as noted on the Course Outline, can also be accessed through
JSTOR. (See the Main Library's electronic journals & texts page for more
information, <http://dizzy.library.arizona.edu/indexes/links/jstor.shtml>.)

The **documents** are available on line-either on Electronic Reserve or at
another linked site; you can retrieve them, depending on their location,
through the Main Library's reserve page or their http addresses. They are also
easily accessed from the Course Website, by clicking on the blue highlighted
addresses.

Although we will move chronologically through the period, this course is not a
comprehensive survey. In fact, I assume that you have taken a general U.S.
history course. For those of you who need an overview of the period, I
recommend the following: William Leuchtenburg, _Perils of Prosperity, 1914-32_
; William Leuchtenburg, _Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, 1932-1941_ ;
Allan Winkler, _Home Front U.S.A. 1941-1945_ ; David M. Kennedy, _Freedom from
Fear: The American People in Depression and War, 1929-1945_.

For those students interested in pursuing additional reading, I recommend
George Sanchez, _Becoming Mexican American: Ethnicity, Culture and Identity in
Chicano Los Angeles, 1900-1945_.   Sanchez' monograph provides an excellent
case study of the cultural experiences of a particular group of people in a
particular place throughout the period we are covering in this course. Some
copies of this optional book are available for purchase at the ASUA Bookstore.
(The book is required for graduate students enrolled in History 538).  There
is also a wealth of additional primary documents available on line.  Check out
the [webliography](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kmorriss/WEBSITES.HTM)  
<http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kmorriss/WEBSITES.HTM>.

**Assignments**

You are expected to complete the **reading** assignments, listed on the Course
Outline, before coming to class and to participate actively in class
**discussions**. There will be a **midterm** on Tuesday, October 19, and a
**final** exam on December 16 at 8am. In addition, there are several written
assignments.

You are required to complete **two short analytical papers** on selected
primary source documents assigned for the course. In these 2-3 page papers you
should analyze the documents within the context of the related course
readings. As you compare and contrast the contemporary opinions presented in
these first-person accounts, be sure to consider the motivations and interests
of the writers. The papers are due in class on the date for which the
documents have been assigned. The first paper must be completed by September
23; the second paper must be completed by December 2. You may turn in
additional short papers for extra credit (up to 10% of your final grade).

The major writing assignment for the course is a **6-8 page paper** on
government-sponsored Depression-era public cultural works, such as WPA/FWP
State Guides, WPA/FAP murals, FSA photographs, Federal Theater Project plays,
and related monographs. You will choose one of these works on which to base
your analytical paper. More information on this assignment has been handed out
in class and is linked
[here](http://www.u.arizona.edu/~kmorriss/lpaper~3.htm).

Your grade will be determined as follows:

25% discussion participation, short response papers  
25% 6-8 pp. paper  
25% midterm  
25% final

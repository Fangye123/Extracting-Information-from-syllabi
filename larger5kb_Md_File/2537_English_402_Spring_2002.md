"And after a very little pause, the King stretching forth his hands, the
executioner at one blow severed his head from his body."  
\--Nathaniel Crouch, _The Wars in England, Scotland and Ireland_.

In 1649, following a decade of civil war, the divinely anointed King Charles I
was executed in the name of Parliament and the English nation; the monarchy
was abolished. These events perhaps most spectacularly mark the seventeenth
century as emergently "modern." We'll ask what this "modernity" meant and how
the writers we are reading viewed the changes they saw around them. What was
being severed in England along with the king, and what was being put (and by
or for whom) in its place? The readings for the course are arranged roughly
chronologically, but we'll also be concerned with a set of related issues that
run through the period: changes in social and gender relations, religious
reformation and conflict, the place of new science and new worlds, both
colonial and urban. We'll ask not only how these issues are represented in our
readings, but how also they affect the very means of representation in the
varying form of the works.

Course policies:  
_Readings_ :  
The readings for each class are due on the date listed above. Approach each
assignment actively by always reading with a pen or pencil in hand. Note
words, phrases or sentences that interest you, that seem significant in the
context of the work, or that you have questions about. Jot down in the margins
any questions or ideas you have about a particular point or the work as a
whole. This practice will help you come prepared to discuss the readings in
class and get the most out of class discussion; it will also help you become a
more skillful reader of literary texts in general.

_Participation_  
_and Attendance_ :  
There will be some historical background presented as lecture, but the class
will mainly be conducted as a seminar. As much as possible we will open up the
class to discussion, to observations about the ideas presented in a text,
about its style, its uses of language, its puzzling qualities--whatever grabs
our attention. I am interested in your ideas. Contribution to class discussion
will not be formally calculated into grades, but I _will_ take participation
into account for grades that are borderline. If you aren't in class, you can't
participate in discussion, nor will active class participation wholly excuse
excessive absences.

_Reading Responses_ :  
The reading responses are meant to help you read carefully, to prepare for
class discussion and to aid you in finding starting points for your essays. A
reading response should either ask a question about or observe some aspect of
the day's reading that is _not answerable by a fact_. For example, a question
about what happens in a poem's narrative would not be appropriate while an
observation about the use of a certain image or the reasons behind a puzzling
sequence of events in the narrative would be. You may also wish to speculate
about how your question or observation would matter for other moments in the
text, or why it seems an important matter to consider. A reading response of a
half page to a page will be required for each day's reading, and collected at
the end of class (the responses need not be typed). I will frequently begin
class by asking some of you to read out your responses. I will read all your
responses and grade them on a credit/no credit basis. They will get credit if
they are turned in at the end of class and meet the criteria above. Grading
will be based on the number of no credits: 0-3=A; 4-5=B; 6-7=C; 8-9=D; 10 or
more=F. I will also use reading responses to keep track of who was in class
for a particular day, so if you were in class but did not do a response (say
it's not so!) let me know you were there.  


_Presentations_ :  
An assumption of this course will be that in interpreting the texts we read
we'll want to know something about who produced them and for what reasons. To
this end, I'll ask you each to provide a presentation on one of the writers
we're reading. These might focus particularly on the relationship of a
relevant event in the writer's life to the readings for the day, or the
author's social/political position, or on the particular situation in which
the author wrote: how did the author conceive of himself as a writer? Why and
for what audience was he writing? Don't try to answer all these questions
though, or give a complete biography of the writer. _Instead, focus on some
aspect of the writer's life or situation that seems worth pursuing for the
class_. The presentation should be about five minutes long. Some sources that
can provide you with quick biographical information: the _Dictionary of
National Biography_ , introductions to individual editions of a particular
author's works, and surveys of seventeenth-century literature. You might also
consult, but don't have to, individual biographies.

_Paper Deadlines_ :  
Each paper will be due twice: the first time in class at the paper workshop
scheduled one week after each paper is assigned, and the second time one week
following that. During the workshop you'll have a chance to trade papers with
fellow students and raise questions or give each other suggestions for
revision. You'll have the second week to revise your paper, based on this
input and on your own rethinking and rewriting. The second week after the
paper is assigned both the revised and original version of the paper will be
handed in to me. I hope that this system will build revision, so necessary to
good writing, into the structure of the course.

Late papers: You need to have your first paper done on time so that you can
work on it in the paper workshop. I also expect that the final versions will
be handed in on time. Late final versions will be graded down a half grade for
each day late. _On late first versions, see below under "paper standards_."

_Paper Standards_ (final and first versions):  
Each paper should be typed with standard margins, spacing and type size. It
should be _carefully_ proofread and neatly presented. The paper topics will
relate to issues we have discussed in class, and you are encouraged to bring
to bear class discussion in your writing. You are also encouraged to expand on
these discussions and credit will be given for new ideas. You may set your own
topic, but you should talk it over with me first.

I'll grade the paper on basis of the revised version only, but I _will_ expect
the original version to be your best initial attempt at the topic. Original
versions not done, not typed or obviously incomplete will result in a half
letter grade reduction in the evaluation of the final paper. It would not be
fair for other students to have to read work that is not your best;
additionally, it is in your interest to write as good an original version as
possible, so that your second version is even better. Remember that because
everyone has two tries at the paper, I will accordingly have higher
expectations for the final version.

_Paper Helps_ :  
During the scheduled workshops, you'll have a chance to give and get advice on
your papers. Additionally, I encourage you to come see me at my office hours
or to make an appointment to see me. When we meet, try to have a draft of the
paper you are working on. This will give us something more concrete to talk
about. There is also available a Writing Center at Robinson A114 that can
provide you with further individual attention to your writing. I encourage you
to take advantage of this excellent facility.

I would also suggest that you give yourself plenty of time to work. Writing a
paper at one sitting is, for most people, unpleasant, and the results are not
likely to be satisfactory. Start early!

_Plagiarism_ :  
Since this class emphasizes the development of your own close reading and
interpretive skills, you are not encouraged to consult secondary sources. If
you do choose to look at such work, however, you _must_ cite, using a standard
citation format, _all_ the articles, books or other sources that your own
writing draws on, _either directly or indirectly_. Such sources include (but
are not limited to) introductions to editions of the texts we're reading and
any kind study aid.

Also note that uncited sources will constitute plagiarism _even if_ they ended
up in your work without your conscious knowledge (e.g. you forgot you read the
material; you confused your own notes with notes on a source), since part of
the scholarly responsibility that comes with using secondary sources is
keeping track of which words or ideas were yours and which came from a source.
If you do not wish to take on this responsibility then you should not consult
secondary sources.

I will take all suspected cases of plagiarism to the Honor Committee.

_Final_ :  
The final will be a take-home essay that will somewhat emphasize the reading
that you have not had a chance to address in your papers, as well as require
you to recall and relate ideas from the semester as a whole.

_Grading_ :  
The final grade will be derived as follows:  
  Presentation | 7 %  
---|---  
Reading responses | 12 %  
First paper | 16 %  
Second paper | 22%  
Third paper | 22 %  
Final | 21 %  
  
Please come see me if you have any questions about grading, the syllabus or
the class. I look forward to having the chance to meet you. Best wishes for a
good semester!

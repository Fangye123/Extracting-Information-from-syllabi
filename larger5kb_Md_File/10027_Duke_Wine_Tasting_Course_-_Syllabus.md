**Course Syllabus  
  
Week 1: Introduction to Wine Tasting  
**Date:**** January 29, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** Dr. Stephen Sanders, Chief of Pediatric Cardiology  
In this session we define the scope of the course and what we aim to achieve
in it. We go on to discuss the proper way to serve and taste wine, as well as
etiquette for wine tastings. Further, we will explore the art of tasting:
firstly how to maximize the flavors perceived in a wine, then how to describe
them in a systematic way.  
  
**Week 2: Basic Types of Wine and Wine Production**  
****Date:**** February 5, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** none  
In this session we will begin by discussing the basic types of wines and how
they are made. Further, we will examine the question of what makes wines so
different in style and quality. Grape variety plays an crucial role but soil,
climate, weather and the intervention of the producer are each important
influences.  
  
**Week 3: Wines with Food**  
****Date:**** Feburary 12, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** Dr. Stephen Sanders, Chief of Pediatric Cardiology  
Wines are made to accompany food and we explore how combinations work or fail.
Pairings may work either by similarity or by contrast, but the combined
flavors must always be in balance.  
  
**Week 4: Northern France and Germany**  
****Date:**** February 19, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** Dr. Stephen Sanders, Chief of Pediatric Cardiology  
We explore three fine regions: Alsace, the Loire valley and Burgundy. Alsace
has forged an identity for its wines with single white varietals of clarity
and concentration. The Loire's whites show mouth-watering acidity balanced by
fruit and, in some cases, complexity and sweetness. Burgundy offers classic
and seductive reds and dry whites, but wide quality variation necessitates
careful selection. Germany's classic Riesling grape demonstrates the art of
late harvest wines better than no other. Some of the country's newer varieties
have also been successful in England's vineyards.  
  
**Week 5: Southern France**  
****Date:**** February 26, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** none  
Southern France sees the balance changing to red wines. The French
Mediterranean is improving its quality greatly, partly by cultivating vines
brought in from the Rhone valley. The latter offers generous and sometimes
exotic red wines, significantly different between its northern and southern
sectors. Bordeaux offers the largest selection of fine wines in the world,
with unsurpassed structured reds and luscious, complex sweet whites.  
  
**Week 6: Italy**  
****Date:**** March 5, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** Dr. Stephen Sanders, Chief of Pediatric Cardiology  
The old image of unreliability has been left behind and Italy is now firmly
established as a producer of fine wines, especially reds. As good practice has
spread, the country is now offering many good value wines. The main regions,
vines and styles are explored here, also the Italians' own creative approach
to the European quality wine system.  
****  
Week 7: Spain, Portugal, and Fortified Wines**  
****Date:****** March 19, 2002 ** ** **  
Guest Expert:****** none **  
** The classic fortified wines sherry and port, in their home countries.
Spain's Rioja may retain its pre-eminence but Ribera del Duero (red) and Rias
Baixas (white) are just two of the regions which have achieved international
recognition. Meanwhile Portugal continues to uncover new levels of quality in
regions both traditional and more recently established. ** **  
  
Week 8: Australia, New Zealand and Central Europe**  
****Date:****** March 26, 2002 ** ** **  
Guest Expert:**** ** John Stoner, Co-President, Fuqua Wine Club **  
** The antipodean countries have made their wines popular with crystal-clear,
fruit-driven styles. New Zealand's cooler climate is revealed in the natural
fresh acidities found in her wines, while Australian producers have searched
out new vineyard locations to achieve great diversity of wine styles. Central
Europe is a great source of inexpensive single grape varietals, many of which
have been improved by antipodean winemaking influence. This part of the world
is also home to some of the great sweet wines of the world. **  
****  
Week 9: South Africa and the Americas**  
****Date:**** April 2, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** none  
South Africa and South America established their credentials as producers of
well-structured reds in the 1970s and 1980s. By the end of the 1990s, well-
made white wines are also in the portfolio. California was the first new world
region in recent history to make an impact on the world stage and, with its
best vineyards often under a blanket of fog, continues to make wines of
classic proportions.  
  
**Week 10: Sparkling Wines**  
****Date:**** April 9, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** none  
Is Champagne better than other sparklers or is its reputation built on hype?
We put the issue to test both in theory and by taste.

**Week 11: Assessment / Party**  
****Date:**** April 16, 2002 ** **  
Guest Expert:**** none  
Finally there's a chance to assess your tasting skills and wine knowledge. You
will have the opportunity to blindly taste 10 wines and see how _you_ stack up
against the instructors. Following the assessment, we will use our remaining
funds to buy extra wine and kick back and have fun.

**WORKSHOP IN INDIAN ARCHITECTURE**  
Hist. of Art Dept., Jaffe Building 201, Friday 10-12  
Professor Michael W. Meister, Jaffe 308

**Archive:**   The University of Pennsylvania houses a photographic archive of
Indian art and architecture (now over 70,000 photographs) as part of the W.
Norman Brown South Asia Reference Room on the fifth floor west end of Van Pelt
library.  To gain access, contact the South Asia bibliographer, David Nelson,
or his staff.  This Archive should be an integral part of your work this
semester.

**Intention:**   This seminar will both introduce you in the remarkable
variety of India's architectural accomplishments and encourage you to discuss
the broader issue of how architecture can be designed to express meaning.  In
the past I have asked students to divide into groups to work together on one
area of India's architecture.  Categories have been:   Early Indian
architecture;  
South Indian architecture;  North Indian architecture;   early Islamic
architecture in India.

This year, I propose to organise readings around a variety of approaches and
methodologies: issues of construction, translation of architectural forms into
new materials, architectural symbolism, typology and chronology, and praxis
(the use and survival of buildings over time).

I will ask you to work collectively, but on different aspects or examples of
the general area, reporting in class on the literature, issues, ideas, and
substance appropriate to each.

        Ananda K. Coomaraswamy, _Essays in Early Indian Architecture_ , ed. Michael W. Meister, Oxford University Press, 1993.   


**Course assignments:**   In addition to participation in class discussion,
students will be asked to prepare short reports for presentation in class and
to choose an area for research leading to a final presentation and paper.

**Time and location:**   Mondays, 6:00 - 9:00 p.m., for 14 weeks beginning 28
August 2000 ( **Calendar** tentative, below), at the University of Florida
Fort Lauderdale Center ( **[Map and directions](../map/index.html)**
available).  
  
**Objectives:** | ![ ](../images/m.gif) | ![ ](../images/m.gif) (1) to learn
the principles of heredity and their application to all organisms, i.e., to
study the chemical nature of the hereditary material and its action,
qualitative and quantitative;  
![ ](../images/m.gif)(2) to establish a foundation for future courses in
biology and medicine, including especially horticulture and plant breeding;
and  
![ ](../images/m.gif)(3) to become better able to understand future
applications of genetics, such as: comprehending popular news reports about
genetics discoveries; making management decisions involving DNA technology;
and understanding personal choices that are presented by health professionals.

**Prerequisites:**   Introductory course in general biology; and botany or
zoology.   Chemistry is strongly recommended.  
  
**Text:**   To be determined.  Probably Klug, W. S. and M. R. Cummings.  2000.
Concepts of genetics.   6th ed.  Prentice Hall, Inc.  Upper Saddle River, NJ.
ISBN 0-13-531062-8.   UF students may purchase the text from the Academic
Programs Office at Fort Lauderdale.

**Recommended:**   Occasionally other readings will be available in the UF
library and/or provided to students.  Additional resources are available at
public libraries and can be purchased commercially.  An excellent sampler is
Gonick, L. and M. Wheelis.  1991.  [Cartoon guide to
genetics](http://www.harpercollins.com/hc/bookpage/index.asp?isbn=0062730991).
HarperCollins Publishers.  New York.  ISBN 0-06-273099-1.  UF students may
purchase the text from the Academic Programs Office at Fort Lauderdale.
Price is $15.90  
  
**Other activities:**   There will probably be one field trip to a DNA
criminology laboratory.  Students will be expected to bring in genetics
related articles from the popular media (newspapers, web pages, TV shows) for
class discussion.  
  
**Instructor:**   Dr. Philip (call me "Phil") Busey. Office: 141 Forman
Building. Phone: 954-577-6337 or FAX 954-475-4125.  If I do not answer, leave
a message.   Better yet, contact me by e-mail
**[turf@ufl.edu](mailto:turf@ufl.edu)**  
  
**Consultations:**   By appointment (preferably) and drop-in (if I am
available).  Available usually Monday 3:00 to 5:00, for short visits, other
times by appointment.  
  
**Suggestions:**   You are encouraged to attend all classes and read the
textbook ahead of the lectures.  
  
**Grading:**   The course grade will be determined from a combination of two
or three 1-hour exams, a final exam, possible quizzes, class participation,
and possible assignments.  Exam scores will derive at least 50% from multiple-
choice questions.  There will be no make-up exams.   However, students who
present unavoidable conflicts may make advance arrangements to take an oral
exam.  Class participation, which determines 5-10% of the grade, is based on
regular attendance, asking questions in class, and being helpful to other
students.  Grading: A=90%+; B+=85-89.9%; B=80-84.9; C+=75-79.9%; C=70-74.9;
D+=65-69.9; D=60-64.9%; E=less than 60%.  
  
**Academic honesty:**   As a result of completing registration, every student
has also previously signed the following statement:  "I understand that the
University of Florida expects its students to be honest in all their academic
work.   I agree to adhere to this commitment to academic honesty and
understand that my failure to comply with this commitment may result in
disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University."

This course deals with an enormous subject in a brief time, for science and
technology encompass the entire scope of how people have sought to comprehend
the world around them and to change that world to suit their needs. To deal
with such a subject successfully, you should constantly be on the look- out
for the "big ideas"--names, dates, and events are significant only if you
understand how they fit into the context of human history.

To succeed in this course you must:

  *  **Keep up with the reading** ; make every effort to complete the week's reading before the meeting of your discussion section; take notes when reading, and particularly try to note questions you have about the author's points and references.
  *  **Keep up with the lectures** ; these cover a great deal of material very quickly, so it is easy to fall behind by missing just one or two; the lectures do not duplicate the reading; much of what is important in the lectures is visual, so don't trust to others' notes to convey what you need to know. While the size of the lecture does not allow for interruptions for questions, you should try to think of points that are unclear or that seem to need more information or explanation. Then ask questions after the lecture or during the discussion section. At the end of every lecture, you will be asked to submit a written response to a question, so do listen carefully. These responses become part of your participation grade.
  *  **Attend your discussion section** ; these are designed primarily to help you comprehend the material in readings and lectures; they are also used as means for assessing your progress in the course. The sections afford you the opportunity to clarify both matters of detail and larger issues. They are also the most important means for learning what to expect on examinations.
  *  **Complete all writing assignments** ; these are described on the course Web site "explorations," and should be kept in a portfolio that will constitute a large component of your section grade and will help you prepare for examinations. Your section leader will explain your writing assignments in greater detail and will provide you with a schedule for submissions.

  
The course grade will be based on the following allocation:

    * Two hour examinations, 15% each =30%
    * Final examination =30%
    * Participation and writing (lecture responses, sections & portfolio) =40%

 **Readings** : The reading assignments in this course come from two sources.
All students should purchase the course text, James McClellan and Harold Dorn,
_Science and Technology in World History, an Introduction_ (Johns Hopkins
Univ. Press).

In addition, all students will be expected to make considerable use of
resources on the World Wide Web, beginning with the Interactive Syllabus for
this course. All registered students receive WAM accounts from the University
(if you have not activated your WAM account, you should do so in the first
week of classes), and have access to WAM labs around campus, as well as dial-
up access both in university housing and from telephone links. The use of
these resources will be an important element in your work for this course.

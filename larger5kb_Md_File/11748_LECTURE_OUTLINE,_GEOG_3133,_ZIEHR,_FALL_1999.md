This outline will include most of the topics that are discussed in class, but
it may vary slightly from what we actually cover in class. This on-line
outline will be updated periodically throughout the semester. To be candid,
I'm revising the class as the semester progresses from the format that I've
used in the past, so new additions to this outline will probably be available
AFTER we've already discussed the material in class. Check your syllabus for
reading assignments.

  1. Location: the key concept in geography
    1. Geography is the "science of location"
    2. Scientific method
      1. Problem or question
      2. Theory (understanding of the system)
      3. Hypotheses (alternative solutions or answers)
      4. Observations (data collection)
      5. Hypothesis testing (objective way to evaluate alternative solutions)
  2. Types of Space (Location)
    1. Absolute location
    2. Relative location
      1. Measures of relative space
        * Distance and direction
        * Cost
        * Time
        * Preference
      2. Case study in interpersonal space
  3. Questions Geographers Ask
    1. Where? (Absolute and relative space)
    2. What is where? (physical and human characteristics of place)
    3. Why are things where they are? (processes and interrelationships
    4. Where _should_ things be?
    5. So what?   (What are the relationships among places, and what are the consequences of those relationships?)
  4. What is Economic Geography?
    1. Definitions of economics
    2. Sectors of the economy
    3. Fundamental economic geography concepts
      1. Simple profit function
        * Profit = f(revenue or sales, costs of production, transportation costs)
        * Revenue location factors
        * Production cost location factors
        * Transportation cost location factors
      2. Economies of scale
  5. Patterns, Processes, and Models
    1. Ways of evaluating spatial distributions
      1. Density
      2. Concentration
      3. Pattern
    2. Processes -- orderliness implies predictable processes
    3. Models
      1. Model - Theory - Law
      2. Components of models
        1. Abstraction
        2. Structure
        3. Domain
  6. Population Issues
    1. World population distribution
    2. Population characteristics
        1. Demographic variables
          1. Total population
          2. Doubling time
          3. Birth rate
          4. Death rate
          5. Total fertility rate
          6. Infant mortality rate
          7. Life expectancy
          8. Female literacy rate
        2. Age-sex (population) pyramids
          1. Shape indicates growth rates
          2. Parents group compared to children group
          3. Dependent groups compared to labor force
    3. Population change
        1. Components of change
          1. Natural change
          2. Migration
        2. Models of change
          * Exponential model
          * Logistic model
          * Demographic transition model
  7. Technology and Economic Development
    1. Technology as a part of culture
      1. Ideology (way of thinking)
      2. Structure (social organization)
      3. Technology (tools and skills)
      4. Resources (material possessions)
    2. Relationship between technology and economic development
      1. Definitions and measures of economic development
        1. Per capita income
        2. GNP
        3. GDP
        4. "Better" not just bigger
        5. Structural change in the economy
    3. Descriptive models of economic development
      1. Economic base theory
        1. Basic employment
        2. Non-basic employment
        3. Multiplier effect
          1. Population multiplier
          2. Economic multiplier
      2. Rostow model (five stages)
        1. "Traditional" society
        2. Preconditions to take-off
        3. Take-off
        4. Drive to maturity
        5. High mass consumption
      3. Circular and cumulative causation
    4. Models of regional economic development
      1. Internal growth theory
      2. Export base theory
        1. Import substitution
        2. Regional specialization
      3. Growth pole (center) theory
        1. Key industry (propulsive industry)
        2. Affected industry
        3. Trickle-down process
        4. Polarization process

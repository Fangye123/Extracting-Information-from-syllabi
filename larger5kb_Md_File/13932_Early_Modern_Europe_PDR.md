**_Purpose of course_**

This PDR is designed to introduce students to the major historiographic
questions asked by historians of Early Modern Europe in the past thirty years.
We will not attempt a narrative coverage of all countries or events in the
three hundred year period. Instead, we will focus on the key tensions over
religion, class, gender, state building and culture that have shaped Western
European culture from 1500 to 1800. In addition, the readings are selected to
provide an introduction to the variety of methods -- ranging from social
history to literary analysis \--used by early modern historians.

**_Reading_**

Articles and chapters from books will be placed on reserve in the history
office and in the graduate reading room of Alexander. Some books will be
placed on reserve at Alexander' graduate reading room. Books marked with an
"*" on the syllabus will be available for purchase through the Recto Verso
bookstore on Albany Street.

**_Writing and participation_**

Students will submit two short (4 to 6-page) "reaction papers", based on the
weekly readings.These papers do not have to correspond to the weeks when
students facilitate discussion. Students will be expected to participate
actively in class discussions and to lead one or two discussions with a
partner.

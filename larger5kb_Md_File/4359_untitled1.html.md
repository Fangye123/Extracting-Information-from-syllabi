#### ` Theme and Objective of the Course`

`  
By the close of the Civil War in 1865, and in the decades immediately
following, it was clear that traditional American architectural values had
broken down under a barrage of ornament and imported European styles. But at
the same moment a new American architecture was taking shape in the
skyscrapers of Chicago, expressive of the new wealth of post-Civil War
America, its new social order, and of the new national scale (rather than the
old regional scale) of the American building industry. The next hundred years
would see a succession of brilliant American architects: Furness, Richardson,
Sullivan, Root, and McKim, Mead, and White; F.L. Wright, the European
immigrants Gropius, Mies and Neutra; the modernists Saarinen, Kahn, and
Johnson; and the post-Moderns and contextualists Venturi, Meier, Gaves,
Eisenman, and Gehry today. At the same time American architects and planners
have had only partial success in solving the problems of city vs. country;
architecture as social welfare; and the concern for national and regional
values as expressed in building. These individual successes and collective
problems will constitute the underlying theme of the course.  
  
`[COURSE MEETINGS  
](meetings.html)  
  
The following listing gives the main theme of each evening's meeting, and
lists the main buildings or projects that will be discussed. The listing "p."
gives the page number in G.E. Kidder Smith's Source Book of American
Architecture: 500 Notable Buildings from the 10th Century to the Present
(Princeton Architectural Press, 1996: available at the Book Centre and on
reserve); the listing "fig." gives the illustration number in Marcus Whiffen
and Frederick Koeper, American Architecture vol. 2: 1860--1976 (M.I.T. Press,
1981: on reserve). These are the roughly-100 buildings you will need to know
thoroughly as the "vocabulary" of this course, nearly all of which are
illustrated in Smith and/or on the website for this course at
www.pitt.edu/~tokerism.  
Students would do well to read the companion text to this course, Whiffen and
Koeper's American Architecture vol. 2. It is neither a required nor a
recommended text, because it is short enough that you can read it each week in
Frick Library, but I can order copies through the Book Centre if there is
interest. The relevant pages are listed below, right after the theme heading
for each lecture.  
September 8: The Civil War as watershed; the triumph of technology (Whiffen
and Koeper, pp. 211-221).  
Nature and impact of the Civil War. Comparing pre- and post-Civil War
buildings and building types: the art academy; the home; the church; the
synagogue; the government building. New building types after 1865.  
Theme of the course: the struggle in Early American architecture was simply to
raise its standards; but the struggle in Triumphant American architecture was
to define its character and its role in national and international terms.

Building-report rewrite is due tonight: it will be handed back at the exam.  
  
  
December 8: Final exam, regular class time and place. (Final grades will be
available at noon on Wednesday 17 in Frick 104: sorry, no telephone inquiries
please.)  
  
  
[OTHER COURSE INFORMATION](oci.html)  
  
Grading will be based on three components: 40% for your building report (10%
for the "pre-summary"; 20% for the paper; 10% for the rewrite); 20% for the
midterm test; and 40% for the final examination. Both the mid-term and the
final will involve analytical skills as well as evidence of thought about the
lectures. A strong performance on the final examination and the building
report can improve weak grades on the mid-term. Please note that W
(withdrawal) grades are assigned by the Dean's office alone, not by
professors, and that I give G (incomplete) grades only for documented illness,
accidents, or emotional stress, and for no other reasons. There is no way you
can earn "extra credit" from me, and I don't raise grades after the final
examination for any reason other than mathematical error: the way to earn a
good or brilliant grade in this course is to start working on it now. This
course follows this Department's statement on academic integrity:
"Plagiarizing is an act that violates the Student Conduct Code, and will not
be tolerated in this class. Plagiarized assignments will result in a failing
grade for that assignment." Note that in the world of the Internet,
plagiarizing has gotten ever more easy: it is mandatory that the full URL
address be given for every website you draw upon for your research.  
  
Office hours and fieldtrip: I would enjoy talking with you in my office
(balcony of Frick Library reading room) on Wednesdays from 11 a.m. to 12 noon,
and from 1 to 2 p.m.; or arrange other times by telephoning 648-2419. Also, my
e-mail address is ftoker@pitt.edu; I will quickly respond to questions you
leave for me there. In some past years this course has gone on special
fieldtrips--as far as Columbus, Ohio: if this interests you, just ask me.  
  
Readings: The text is G.E. Kidder Smith's Source Book of American Architecture
(see above). This is a brand-new departure for me, because it is not a
textbook. Students have several times asked for a "text" that would go in
greater detail on specific buildings. My lectures will thus be the text for
this course, but Smith is an ideal companion to the lectures, with his
excellent text and photographs: as you can see, nearly all the buildings I
will discuss in detail are in his book as well. ( You are responsible for all
"key works" from the lectures, whether they are in the text or not.) You
should buy Smith, and you may want to keep up with the lectures in Marcus
Whiffen and Frederick Koeper's American Architecture vol. 2: 1860--1976, which
is on reserve. There are also about two dozen other specialized texts on
reserve under our course number: you should consult them regularly as an aide
to a deeper understanding of the material than the main text can give you.

The building report  
HA&A 1531, like all my upper-level classes, has long had as one of its
requirements a term paper embodying original research. The topics on which
these papers are based normally exclude buildings in Pittsburgh or Western
Pennsylvania. This year, however, exactly the opposite is true: students are
free to write reports on any buildings in post-Civil-War America, but you are
particularly encouraged to write on local buildings. Reason? Your instructor
has been invited to write on the buildings of Allegheny County for a new book
called Buildings of Western Pennsylvania, one of 54 volumes in the Buildings
of the United States series, sponsored by the Society of Architectural
Historians. I have already covered 95% of these buildings in my Pittsburgh: An
Urban Portrait, back in 1986. But this forthcoming book has a different
orientation, more like your text by Kidder Smith. Students with whom I have
discussed this assignment thought it would have more appeal than the "usual"
kind of term paper; I believe they're right. This class will be credited in
general for any parts used in the final book, and students whose text is
especially professional will receive specific credit.  
  
Your assignment, then, is to write approximately 400 words (800 at the most--
that's two pages of computer doublespaced text, or one and a half pages in
Pittsburgh: An Urban Portrait) on a standing Allegheny County building--or not
in Allegheny County if you would rather work in some other region. Use the
Kidder Smith type of write-up as your guide. The write-up should describe the
building, show its interaction with its environment, connect it to the other
known works by the same architect, and give a critique of the building,
examining its special call to our attention. To get an idea of a typical
200-to-400-word entry, see the entries on Detroit buildings, pp. 63--122 in
Buildings of Michigan in the same series, on reserve. Note the high number of
"brand-new" buildings on the list below: these offer you the chance to put
your own mark on a building before any other writer.  
  
The paper is due in three stages: select topic buildings--first come, first
served--at any meeting up to and including September 22. (Note: as a locator
of "your" building, use the two maps appended at the back of the hard-copy
version of this syllabus, on reserve.) A one-page bibliography and "plan of
attack" (what I call the pre-summary) is due October 20: it will be handed
back to you on October 27, with comments. The paper is due on November 3, and
will then be corrected and sent back to you for a rewrite of no more than 200
to 400 words long, due December 1. This final paper will, of course, be handed
back to you, but it must be handed in with three "extras" that will not be
handed back: a clean copy, illustrations, and photocopies of your research
materials. The paper will not receive a grade without those three extras and a
proper bibliography (if your sources are, in part, oral, these must be
documented too.) Illustrations and photocopies of your research materials
ought to be handed in with the first paper, too, but they will be returned at
that time.  
  
Three further notes about the paper: all papers, early or late, must be
delivered into my hands or under my door on the Frick Library balcony only: I
will neither chase down nor give credit for papers that were supposedly mailed
to me or put in someone's box. Late papers will be penalized 10% for each week
of lateness, and none will be accepted beyond the last class lecture.  
  
Buildings for the building-report: here follow those currently under
consideration for Allegheny County: students are welcome to propose other
American post-Civil-War buildings within or outside of Allegheny County for
their reports: these will follow the same schedule as outlined above. The
abbreviations GT etc. are explained below. All the buildings or districts are
mentioned in Pittsburgh: An Urban Portrait except those indicted as not in
P:AUP. Students are especially encouraged to tackle the "tougher" entries:
those not in P:AUP and the multiple or "district" entries, such as Carnegie-
Mellon's campus. Besides the satisfaction of doing tougher work, students may
be assured that a decent job on a tougher entry will score as high or higher
in grading than a fine job on an easier entry.

Atlases and Plat-Books of Pittsburgh began in the 18th century but in their
printed form date from the later l9th century. Their titles may be found in
PITTCAT under "Pittsburgh -- Maps". Among the major series are the Warrantee
Atlas; Atlas of the City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny and Adjacent Boroughs (l872
and later, by G.M. Hopkins); Real Estate Plat-Book (l896 and later); Insurance
Map of Pittsburgh (l924 on, published by Sanborn Map Company); Ward Books
(Pittsburgh Magazine Company, 1911, for each of the 27 wards).  
  
Miscellaneous resources in HILLMAN LIBRARY: The Archives Service Center
contains the University of Pittsburgh archives, certain specialized
collections, and the Archives of Industrial Society, including the City
Photographer collection (50,000 glass negatives, 1900 to 1960), histories of
numerous clubs, companies and churches, and biographical files. The most
important of these collections for Pittsburgh urbanism and buildings are the
Building Permit Dockets for Pittsburgh, 1878-1916. (The post-1916 permits are
in certificate form, and are reportedly housed in great disorder in the Bureau
of Building Inspection at the Public Safety Building, Downtown). The building
permit entries are by year, ward by ward, and detail the structure and cost,
owner and builder of all new Pittsburgh buildings of the period. The IAS has
the originals, but generally gives you microfilms to use.  
  
Miscellaneous resources in the CARNEGIE PUBLIC LIBRARY: In the microfilm
collection, second floor, are all city directories. Sanborn insurance maps of
Pittsburgh and all Pennsylvania available on microfilm for 1884 (partial);
1893; 1906; 1927; 1951. These show every building in the city, with detailed
plans of industrical complexes, labeled. The Music and Art Department, second
floor, has index-card drawers on the buildings of Pittsburgh: drawers 53, 54,
55 on architects, and buildings by institutional categories (e.g. churches) as
well as homes by owners names. The same department has three clippings files
on architects and prominent buildings.  
  
The Pennsylvania Department, second floor, contains the Pittsburgh Photograph
Library of thousands of large-format contact prints; full clippings files on
neighborhoods and buildings; a "biography index" of card catalogs that cite
prominent Pittsburghers in books; and a biographical clippings file on
Pittsburghers that is most useful in determining facts on buildings.  
  
Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional Historical Center, 1212 Smallman Street
in The Strip (tel. 454-6000) is the new shape of the old HISTORICAL SOCIETY OF
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Its marvelous holdings include books, pamphlets, and
clippings on prominent Pittsburghers, neighborhoods, nearby towns, clubs,
factories, and buildings of all sorts. Here are the originals of hundreds of
atlases, plat-books, insurance maps, and city-planning maps that will give you
instant information on the development of the neighborhoods you are studying.
Some originals can be consulted, otherwise microforms. (Library open 10 to 5,
Tuesday through Saturday: as of press time they had not ruled on what they
would charge student visitors.)  
  
HSWP has a clipping file on subjects as well as a picture file on Pittsburgh
buildings; the Music and Art Department of Carnegie Library has a cross-
reference card catalog to articles about Pittsburgh buildings and Pittsburgh
architects, while the Pennsylvania Department of the same library has
clippings on buildings, streets and neighborhoods, in addition to the
Pittsburgh Photographic Library and slides of Pittsburgh.  
  
A major resource on standing buildings is the Allegheny County Survey of the
Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, ca. 1978-1985. Survey files are
kept at PH&LF in Station Square, and list thousands of significant buildings
in the County, by neighborhood. Synopsis in Kidney, Landmark Architecture.

BASIC METHODOLOGY OF THIS COURSE:  
ARCHITECTURAL DESCRIPTION, ANALYSIS, AND CRITIQUE  
  
The following is an outline of the personal methodology I have developed over
the years for dealing with buildings. I will use it, modified where
appropriate, for every building I discuss in this course. I will expect you to
use it too, not to give the "right answers" about architecture (there are no
right answers in this field, anyway), but to develop the strongest possible
arguments for positions that you take, in class, in your written assignments,
and on your tests.  
  
Six steps in architectural history. Description, analysis, and criticism are
the first three steps by which scholars or amateurs typically look at
buildings (or any works of art). It seems to me that there are six steps in
all:  
1) describe the building  
2) analyze it (show how it works both functionally and formally)  
3) create a provisional criticism (judgment based on "just looking")  
4) learn and incorporate facts of the building's history  
5) create a learned criticism (based on facts as well as personal reactions)  
6) expand into a theory of architecture  
  
Three definitions in Webster's Collegiate Dictionary may help:  
Describe: "To represent by words; to give an account of."  
Analyze: "To separate or resolve into elements or constituent parts. To
separate mentally the parts of (a whole) so as to reveal their relation to it
and to one another; as, to analyze an economic theory. To study the factors of
(a solution, problem, or the like) in detail, in order to determine the
solution or outcome."  
Criticism: "The art of judging with knowledge and propriety the beauties and
faults of works of art or literature."  
  
When you think about a building, and especially when you write on one, you are
effectively dividing your critique into three separate parts (in written work,
these should be indicated with subheadings):  
  
Description  
Analysis  
Criticism  
  
Let's look at the words description, analysis, and criticism in respect to
light. Recently I told my optometrist: "You know, my father was right: I can
read a lot better when my book is under a bright light."  
  
Dr. Morgan replied: "Of course: the pupil reacts to the bright light by
getting smaller. When

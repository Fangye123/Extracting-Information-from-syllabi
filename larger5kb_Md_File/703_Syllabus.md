###  Course Description

###  This course covers the major themes in European intellectual history.
There is a traditional narrative that includes such topics as the birth and
diffusion of the Enlightenment, Romanticism, 19th century liberalism,
positivism, the Darwinian Revolution, Marxism, nationalistic thought,
irrationalism in political and contemporary philosophical thought,
existentialism, modernism and postmodernism. The course develops new
approaches and methods in the field of cultural and intellectual history.

* * *

###  **Course Goals**

> * **Build upon the body of knowledge about European intellectual and
cultural history developed in survey level courses (World History Since 1500
or Western Civilization Since 1660).   .**

> * **Add to the repertoire of new historical methods identified in the 200
level course on Methods and Materials and understand the discipline in terms
of the Eurocentrism that shapes all research (Burke).**

> * **Uncover "silences" in the different approaches to the field. (Jacques
Barzun and C.P. Snow [traditional and "liberal"], Raymond Williams [English
neo-Marxist] and Stuart Sim [Post/Anti-Marxist, Post/Anti-Modern and
Post/Anti-Liberal)**

> * **Evaluate contemporary historical problems and issues in the context of
new knowledge and revised methods of   European Cultural and Intellectual
History including the postmodern critique of the discipline.**

>> **Requirements and Evaluations**

>

> **Writing:   There are FOUR forms of writing that are required in the
course:**

>

> **1\. Questions prepared before class session \- posted on the web at least
twenty four hours BEFORE a class session**

>

> **2\. Notes taken during class sessions - posted on the web no more than
twenty four hours AFTER a class session.**

>

> **3\. Synthetic summaries of questions and class discussions - posted on the
web within ONE WEEK of a class session.**

>

> **4\. Peer evaluations of the questions, notes and summaries prepared by
members of the class.   Criteria for evaluation will be developed during the
month of January.**

    The class will be divided into five  (5) groups.  Individuals in  each group will be responsible for ONE of the FOUR required forms of writing  for the specific date.  One fifth of the class will have NO SPECIFIC WRITING ASSIGNMENT as we rotate the writing requirements.  Group memberships and writing assignments will begin during the second week of the semester.  Initial submissions will be used to establish the criteria  for evaluation of the different forms of writing; e.g. What makes a question a "good" question? Is there a good **_sequence_** of questions?   Which set of notes demonstrate the  Which class notes demonstrate effective development of critical listening skills? (including the active role of the listener in interrupting a speaker and asking for a clarification of a comment)?  Why is  one synthetic summary different from or better than another?   What distinguishes an evaluation that helps a student improve the ability to write questions, take notes and prepare summaries from an evaluation that a student is unable to use in improving a writing skill?

**         Fifteen percent of the grade will be awarded to each of the four
categories of required writing.  After we establish the criteria for quality
in each of the genres we are developing, we will determine how many and which
of the assignments will be used to construct the final grade.**

**Research**

**Students must submit a review of scholarly periodical literature (no less
than ten articles, no less than ten book reviews) and _apply_ one or more of
the themes developed during the first half of the semester to the articles
and book reviews selected for the review of the literature.**

**         Thirty percent of the grade will be awarded to the research
paper.**

**         Ten percent of the grade will be awarded to the final exercise - a
peer critique of the research paper.**

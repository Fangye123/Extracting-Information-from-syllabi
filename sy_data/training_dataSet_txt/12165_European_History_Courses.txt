HIEU 503  GREECE IN THE FOURTH CENTURY 
 Ms. Elizabeth
Meyer

 This is an advanced course in Greek history (in discussion-seminar
format) that examines in detail the period from the end of the Peloponnesian
War in 404 B.C. to the defeat of the Greek city-states at Chaeronea in 338. 
It is particularly concerned with the social and economic, as well as the
political, history of the fourth century; this means that the focus will be
chiefly on Athens rather than on the other city-states or the "nation-state"
of Macedon.  The major aim of the class will be to write a twenty- to twenty-five page research paper (to be submitted in draft first); in addition to this
there will be five two-page exercises on evidence and method due throughout
the term.  The course fulfills the second writing requirement.  Readings will
be drawn from the following:

     Xenophon, Hellenica, (A History of My Times), trans. R. Warner)

Greek Political Oratory (trans. A.N.W. Saunders, Penguin, 1970)

     A.N. Saunders, ed. Demosthenes and Aeschines (Penguin, 1975) 
     P. Harding, From the End of the Peloponnesian War to the Battle of
Ipsos (sourcebook; Cambridge, 1985) 
     J. Ober, Mass and Elite in Classical Athens (Princeton, 1989)

     Plutarch, The Rise and Fall of Athens and The Age of
Alexander 
     Aeneas Tacticus, How to Survive Under Siege (trans. D. Whitehead,
Oxford, 1990; recommended) 
     Diodorus Siculus vols. 6 and 7 (Loeb; recommended)

HIEU 507  MODERN THEORY: MARX, ARENDT, FOUCAULT, SARTRE 
 Mr. Allan
Megill  
 In this course we shall examine four major "modern" theorists,
namely, Karl Marx, Hannah Arendt, Jean-Paul Sartre, and Michel Foucault. 
There is an interesting contrast between Marx and the others, and one focus of
the course will be on exploring that contrast.  Marx was still a believer in
progress: Arendt, Sartre, and Foucault, on the other hand, were "crisis
thinkers," who could no longer rely on "the firm basis of traditional values"
(as Arendt put it in 1946).  Our modus operandi will be to combine a
very selective reading in the secondary literature with readings of
major works by each writer.  Characteristically, each week I shall begin by
speaking for 20 minutes or so, in an attempt to situate the reading for that
week and to pose some interesting issues.  We shall then engage in discussion
of the reading.  Students should have some background in political theory,
intellectual history, philosophy, or philosophically-oriented religious
studies. 
     
 The syllabus has not yet been set up; consequently, there is not yet
a definitive reading list.  Works from which we shall likely read include
Marx, Early Writings, Arendt, Eichmann in Jerusalem and The
Human Condition; Foucault, Essential Works, vol. 1; and Sartre,
Being and Nothingness.  Students who are interested in the class might
consider approaching me before August and preferably before June
(megill@virginia.edu); their conversations with me might well have some effect
on the syllabus, which I expect to revise in early August.
     
 The course is intended to provide an opportunity for graduate
students and advanced undergraduates to explore one or another of these
thinkers in depth.  Characteristically, the class is taken by students who
would like to write a fairly substantial paper on one of the four thinkers, or
on some theme that was important for one or more of them.  Students write a
20-25 page paper; they are also expected to do the reading, to contribute to
discussion, to write up class minutes on occasion, and to offer reports on
their reading on occasion.  


HIEU 516  THE MEDIEVAL CHURCH 
 Mr. Everett U.
Crosby  
 A documentary history of the organized church in the Latin west from
the beginnings to the sixteenth century.  The sources of the faith, liturgical
practice, the sacraments and the monopoly on salvation, heresy and
inquisition, the church as an economic enterprise, the religious orders,
episcopal government, papal monarchy, canon law, and ecclesiastical
architecture will be among the topics for reading and discussion. 
Requirements: one essay on a subject related to the work of the course, and a
final examination.  Open to undergraduates and graduate students.  No
requisites.  


HIEU 530  NATIONALITY, ETHNICITY AND RACE IN 19TH- AND           
         20TH-CENTURY EUROPE 
 Mr. Robert P.
Geraci  
 In this seminar we will explore how Europeans have conceived,
reified, managed, and experienced categories of human identity for the past
two centuries.  Insofar as we will be viewing these categories as originally
"imagined" or "constructed" we will examine the various materials that have
been used to define them and to bring them to life, including not only
politics also the sciences and culture.  In turn, we will also be concerned
with the substantial power wielded by these categories in modern Europe -- in
the internal affairs of particular European societies, in relations and
rivalries among them, and in the management of multi-ethnic empires that
extended beyond Europe.  
     
 Though we will focus primarily on England, France, Germany and
Russia/USSR, we will also include readings on other countries of Europe when
possible.  We will attempt to establish patterns of difference and commonality
across Europe in the position and treatment of indigenous ethnic and
confessional minorities and of groups of non-European origin (as colonial
subjects, immigrants, or domestic minorities).  We will address the latest
historical scholarship and conclude the seminar with material on present-day
Europe.  Major works included in the syllabus are Liah Greenfeld,
Nationalism, Ivan Hannaford, Race: The History of an Idea in the
West; George Stocking, Jr., Victorian Anthropology; Rogers
Brubaker, Citizenship and Nationhood in France and Germany; Alon
Confino, The Nation as Local Metaphor; Robert Proctor, Racial
Hygiene; and Kathleen Paul, Whitewashing Britain.  We will also
read shorter selections by scholars such as Stephen Jay Gould, Jacques Barzun,
Yuri Slezkine, Sander Gilman, and Ann Laura Stoler.
     
 Upperclass undergraduates as well as graduate students in history,
the humanities and the social sciences are encouraged to enroll.  A basic
knowledge of European history is desirable but not required.  Each student
will be required to submit several one- to two-page papers summarizing
readings, and to produce a historiographical essay of 15-20 pages.  


HIEU 558  THE BRITISH EMPIRE 
 Mr. Richard
Drayton 
 This is a seminar course which will examine the history of the
British Empire, from its foundations in the Seventeenth century to the era of
Decolonization, and including both its European center, and its American,
Asian, African, and Pacific peripheries.  It aims to provide you with a mental
map of the pattern of British expansion over the long term, to introduce you
to both old and new historiographical approaches, and to the reading of
primary sources.  Your grade will be based on your participation in the
seminar, and on a 25-page research paper.  While there are no formal
prerequisites, it is intended for graduate and for advanced undergraduates who
are ready to undertake work at a high level.  
 HIEU 702  COLLOQUIUM ON EARLY MODERN EUROPE 
 Mr. H. C.
Erik Midelfort
 This course provides a rigorous and comprehensive introduction to
fifteen important topics in the history of early modern Europe, ca. 1350-1750. 
While the required reading is in English and cannot touch on all aspects of
each national literature from the Baltic to the Mediterranean, lists of
supplementary reading will guide those who want suggestions in areas that we
cannot all cover in class.  Oral reports will acquaint the class with books or
disputes that we will not have time to examine in detail.
     
 Students will write five book reviews of about 1000 words each, drawn
from the list of assigned or collateral reading.  Each student will also make
one presentation to the class of about ten minutes, introducing or summarizing
a recommended book.

 Required reading will be drawn from the following books:

Francis Oakley, The Western Church in the Late Middle Ages

students in modern European history.  Open to others with the consent of the
instructor.  "Discussion of major topics in the history of 20th century
European history within a seminar setting."


HIEU 802  MASTER'S ESSAY RESEARCH 
 Mr. H. C.
Erik Midelfort
 This course is intended to bring students to the point of finishing
their Master's Theses.  Weekly meetings concentrate on the careful definition
of useful topics, library research methods and exercises, theoretical and
technical writing problems, and on mutual criticism of written results.  There
is no set required reading, but all students will have to find and read a few
master's theses in their area of interest to get a sense of what such a thesis
is.  With due application, second-year students should be able to finish their
theses during the semester.

##  **Description:**

This course is about the use, design, and implementation of operating systems.
The goal in teaching this course is to help you understand:

  * What is an operating system, what does it do, and why we have it?
  * The fundamental abstractions provided by operating systems.
  * The design issues and decisions that go into implementing these abstractions.

##  **Course Requirements:**

**Prerequisites:**  
    


The course prerequisites for COSI 31a are COSI 21a and COSI 21b. You should
have basic familiarity with Unix and either C, C++ or Java.

**Assignments**

There will be _biweekly_ problem sets, _three_ programming assignments and
occasional quizzes. Problem sets, programming assignments and quizzes will be
provided in class, and solutions to the problem sets will be posted on this
page.

Hand in your homework before the beginning of class (i.e., by 10:10) on the
day the homework is due. **Please typeset each problem on a separate sheet of
paper**.

**Readings**  
The text for this course is

  * **Modern Operating Systems** , by Andrew Tannenbaum, 2nd Edition (Prentice Hall Publishersi, ISBN: 0130313580) _( **MOS** )_. In addition, selected papers will be distributed during the course in order to fill in some gaps in the textbook treatment of the core material (e.g. virtual memory and concurrency).

It is also strongly recommended that you buy or borrow a text on Java, as that
will be the language for programming assignments in this course. For example,
the classic Java reference is:

  * **The Java Programming Language** , by Ken Arnold and James Gosling (Addison-Wesley Publishers, 1996).

There are also numerous online references including:

  * [The Java Tutorial](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/index.html)
  * [The Java Language Specification](http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/html/index.html)
  * [Java API Documentation](http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/docs/api/packages.html)
  * [Real's home(JAVA & JAVASCRIPT How-to)](http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Vista/1337/realhome.html). A very helpful site with great examples.
  * [JDK tools from "Java in a nutshell"](jdktools/index.html)

**In-Class Handouts**

  * [Course Syllabus](index.html) (8/31)
  * [Assembly Language Handout](AssemblyLanguageHandout.txt) (TBD)
  * Java Handout (TBD). Available in the Office.

  
**Class Notes**

    * Not yet.  **Lectures**   
You are responsible for understanding **both** the material covered in the
readings and the lectures for this course. The purpose of the lectures is to:

    * help you to focus on the most relevant parts of the readings,
    * help clarify questions about the readings, and
    * supplement the readings with material otherwise not covered.
**On-line Support**  
We have set up a [newsgroup](news:brandeis.classes.cs31a) for posting and
reading questions about topics relevant to this course (lectures, readings,
assignments etc.) and a class mail account **cs31a@cs.brandeis.edu** for
sending in material etc. Please post all of your questions to the newsgroup,
rather than sending e-mail to the instructor, except for questions that only
concern you (e.g., in order to set up an appointment to meet).

We will also use the newsgroup to post announcements regarding the course.
Make sure you check the postings regularly. If you are unfamiliar with how to
read news, speak to a TA.

##  **Grading:**

It is important for you to realize what grades in this class reflect and what
they don't reflect. All we can grade you on is how well you have demonstrated
that you know the material this semester. But we cannot grade you on how much
of a success you will be after graduation, how smart/creative/persistent/self-
motivated you are, or even how well you will be able to apply the material in
the future. And after all, it's what you do in the future, not what you do
this semester, that is really important.

That said, grades will be determined roughly as follows:  Final: | 30%  
---|---  
Midterm: | 15%  
Homework Assignments and Projects: | 50%  
Quizzes: | 5%  
  
In the past, the TA's and I have spent a lot of time dealing with regrading
appeals, time that would be better spent helping students learn the material.
Absolutely come to us if we made an arithmetic error, but realize that a few
points here and there are extremely unlikely to make any difference in your
final grade. We will apply the following rule: _if you ask us to regrade
something, we will regrade the entire exam, problem set, or project
assignment, and we will deduct points if we find we were overly generous._
Thus, your grade will be as likely to go down as up.

###  Cooperating:

I believe students in this class can learn as much from each other as they do
from lectures. In order to encourage a spirit of cooperation instead of
competition among students, I will give you an opportunity to tell us about
those students who have helped you the most in understanding the material in
the course. This information will be turned into extra points for the helper.
In other words you can only improve your grade by helping out your classmates.

###  Cheating:

Note that cooperation is not the same as cheating. It's okay to ask someone
about the concepts needed to do the homework (provided you give them credit \-
see above). However, copying other people's solution sets is strictly
prohibited. The homework must be the work of the student turning it in \- we
will punish transgressions severely. A simple procedure to keep yourself on
the right side of the line is that after a student or TA helps you with an
assignment, go watch cartoons for half an hour, then go back to working on the
assignment. If you cannot remember what the person said after half an hour,
you did not really understand it.

You are responsible for protecting your homework directories so that others
cannot view them or copy them. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of
academic integrity. To protect a unix directory called "homework", "chmod og-
rwx homework".

###  Exams:

There will be a single midterm and a final. Approximate dates are listed
below. If you have a conflict with either the final or the midterm, let me
know, and I will schedule a makeup for the day before the exam is given to he
rest of the class. Both exams will be closed book and will cover material from
lectures, readings and homework.

###  Quizzes:

There will be occasional (5 min) in-class quizzes covering the current class
material and readings. The idea is to provide quick feedback on how the class
is doing.

###  Homework Assignments:

Homework assignments include reading, problem sets and projects. I will assign
written problem sets at a rate of roughly one every two weeks. The idea is to
give you an opportunity to think more deeply about the concepts presented in
the course. Problem sets contain questions similar to the ones that appear in
the midterm and final exams. Problem sets are to be done individually. Please
bring your completed problem set to class the day it's due. Homework are
collected before the class begins.

**Late Policy**

A late problem set will lose 20% for every day or part thereof that it is
late. Therefore, an assignment which is due on Thursday at 9:10 will be graded
as follows. Assume that the assignment is worth a grade of 100% before any
late penalty is applied. If that assignment is submitted between Thursday at
9:11 and Friday at 9:10, then it will receive a grade of 80%. If it is
submitted between Friday at 9:11 and Monday at 9:10, it will receive a grade
of 60%. If it is submitted between Monday at 9:11 and Tuesday at 9:10, it will
receive a grade of 40% etc. Note that no assignments will be accepted after
the solutions for that assignment have been posted.  
Note also that no late submissions to will be accepted for the last assignment
so we can post the solutions well in advance of the final exam.

##  **Current Assignment:**

Not Yet

##  **Schedule:**

As best as possible we will keep to the schedule below. Some topics may
require more time than is allotted, so the lecture schedule may get modified
as we get further into the course.

 Please note that there will be no classes on the following days:

    * Mon, 9/2: Labor Day
    * Mon, 9/16: Yom Kippur
    * Thu, 11/28: Thanksgiving
In the course schedule below, the reading assignments cover the material that
is discussed **that** week. To get the most out of the lectures, you should

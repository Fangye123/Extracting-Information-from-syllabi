2\. **Title** : Topics: Multicultural Children's Literature and Literacy  
  
**3\. Course Description** : Lecture 3 hour; 3 credit. Prerequisite: graduate
standing. Provides for the examination, evaluation, and use of multicultural
library materials and resources for elementary/middle school children and
young adults. Materials for adolescents and adults with limited reading
abilities are also covered.  
  
**Purpose - Educator as a Professional**  
  
A teacher is an expert in a field of knowledge who can relate his or her
wisdom to novices.  
A professional teacher can defend his or her practices based on the "state-of-
the-art." The ODU undergraduate and fifth year teacher education programs
include extensive experiences in the liberal arts, early field experiences,
in-depth content preparation, principals of learning theory, classroom
management techniques, methods and materials for teaching specific levels,
categories of students, and/or subjects, and practice in the field. Graduate
programs provide additional professional development experiences for inservice
teachers. The sum of these components prepare an educator to be a life-long
learner and thus constantly at the edge of the state-of-the-art.  
  
**4\. Course Competencies**  
  
The course is designed to assist students, teachers, and library media
specialists in the selection and evaluation of multicultural literature and in
the development, implementation, and evaluation of effective multicultural
literature/reading programs that improve students' reading and writing
abilities. The course is designed to meet the needs of the following four
populations: (1) teachers who want to develop and teach multicultural
literature/reading programs; (2) library media specialists who want to
develop, implement, and evaluate multicultural programs; (3) students who want
to investigate and to complete research in multicultural literature and
reading; and (4) students who want to add a multicultural component to
university courses in children's literature, reading, language arts, and/or
English as a second language.

1\. Become familiarized with notable books and/or materials dealing with the
various ethnic minority groups.  
  
2\. Develop the ability to evaluate books for evidence of stereotyping and
bias.  
  
3\. Become aware of the historical development of multicultural children's
literature.  
  
4\. Learn how to develop and evaluate a multicultural literature/reading
curriculum.  
  
5\. Become aware of the various tools (i.e., journals, awards, reference
materials, etc.) that can be used to select high quality multicultural
children's literature.  
  
6\. Learn how to determine the cultural authenticity of multicultural
children's books and/or materials.

5\. **Course Requirements**  
  
a. READ at least 50 books for students in grades K-8. Select books from one of
the class reading lists or from other reputable sources. Keep a record of your
readings by writing an annotated bibliography for each title. Examples can be
located on electronic reserve (Taylor, Sreenivasan & Toke, 1998). A copy of
your bibliographies is due by **August 10** in the instructor's office at ODU.  
  
b. CREATE four (4) lesson plans based on Virginia's Standards of Learning and
quality multicultural children's literature. Lesson plans are due on **August
10.**  
  
c. WRITE and PRESENT one (1) oral presentation. Choose from: a) lesson
demonstration based on Virginia's Standards of Learning; b) booktalk or c)
storytelling. Oral presentation must use at least one (1) title of high
quality multicultural literature. Provide each member of the class with a copy
of your lesson plan (lesson demonstration) ; a bibliography (booktalk) or a
souvenir (storytelling). Please see course manual for details.  
  
  
**6\. Students with Special Needs** \-- In accordance with university policy,
a student who wishes to receive some instructional accommodation, because of a
documented sensory and/or learning disability, should meet with the instructor
to discuss this accommodation.  
  
**7\. Attendance Policy** \-- **Attendance and Student Conduct**  

"Because the class period is important and discussions cannot be reproduced,
absences cannot be made up. Excessive absences can have a negative effect on
the student's learning and performance. A student who must miss a class is
expected to have the initiative necessary to cover properly the materials
missed. The student must meet all course deadlines and be present for all
quizzes, tests and examinations."

"A student enrolling in the University shall conduct himself or herself in a
manner compatible with the University's educational mission." _ODU Catalog._

Students are therefore expected to maintain regular class attendance, arrive
on time, and _participate in class activities and discussions_ in a
professional manner. Additionally, lack of professional behavior and
participation will result in substantial grade penalties.

For example, students who demonstrate excessive absences and tardiness or
demonstrate lack of participation, preparation and/or professional behavior
will have final grade lowered by half.

  
Further penalties to be decided by instructor.  
  
8\. **Course Evaluation**  
  
The evaluation of students will be based on: a) annotated bibliography; b)
participation; c) oral presentation; d) four lesson plans.  
  
**Assignments**  
  
All assignments must include student's full name, date, course number (ECI
695) and instructor's name as a heading or on the cover. Annotated
bibliographies should be stapled with a cover sheet.  
  
**Late Assignments**  
  
Assignments must be turned in on the due date. Late assignments will be
penalized 10% of the possible point value if submitted within one week of the
due date, the extent of further penalties will be determined by the
instructor. Poorly written papers will be returned to students to be
rewritten, and will be penalized 10% of their possible point value.  
  
  
**Grading**  
  
Grading will be done on a point system.

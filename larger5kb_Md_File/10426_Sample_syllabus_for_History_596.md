**Assignments**

We will have regular weekly homework assignments and a take-home final
examination. The homework assignments are demanding, so the course will not
require a term paper or data collection. The take-home final will require
mastery of all the quantitative methods we will study in the course. Class
attendance and participation are required.

Graduate students will be required in addition to analyze a body of data
available in the published literature in their field (e.g.-- voting returns,
price series, etc.) and to make a written report of their findings.

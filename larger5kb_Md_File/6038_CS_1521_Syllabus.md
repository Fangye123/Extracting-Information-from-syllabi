**Bulletin Description:  
** Procedural and data abstraction. Elementary abstract data types, including
stacks, queues, and their applications. Intermediate abstract data types,
including trees, heaps, hash tables, and their applications. External methods.

**Prerequisites:  
** Quarter prerequisite: CS-1622, Semester prerequisite: CS-1511, or the
equivalent if you are a transfer student. This course also assumes a working
knowledge of C. **Important note:** The computer science program at UMD is
accredited by CSAB (the Computer Sciences Accreditation Board). One of the
CSAB requirements is that all students _must_ satisfy the prerequisites in
order to be admitted to a course, so if you have not passed the prerequisite
course, you will be asked to drop CS 1521 (if you have any questions about
this, please see the instructor after the lecture or in office hours).

**Equal Opportunity:  
** The University of Minnesota is committed to the policy that all persons
shall have equal access to its programs, facilities, and employment without
regard to race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age, marital
status, disability, public assistance status, veteran status, or sexual
orientation. As instructor, I am committed to upholding University of
Minnesota's equal opportunity policy. I encourage you to talk to me in private
about any concerns you have related to equal opportunity in the classroom. To
inquire further about the University's policy on equal opportunity, contact
the Office of Equal Opportunity, 255 DAdB, [

**Students with Disabilities:  
** If you have any disability (either permanent or temporary) that might
affect your ability to perform in this class, please inform me at the start of
the quarter. I may adapt methods, materials, or testing so that you can
participate equitably. To learn about the services that UMD provides to
students with disabilities, contact the Access Center/Disability Services 138

**Course Objectives:  
** The course begins with a brief introduction to the C++ language and the
concepts of abstraction, encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance. The
basic design principles of object oriented programs are discussed and the
concept of an ADT ( **A** bstract **D** ata **T** ype) is introduced. The ADT
concept is then elaborated on in a series of assignments and lectures covering
the basic ADTs: lists, stacks, queues, tables, trees and graphs. By the end of
the course, the student should have mastered the main concepts of Object
Oriented Programming and have successfully completed programming assignments
in C++ on each of the basic ADTs.

**Texts:  
**

  1. Robert Lafore, [ _Object-Oriented Programming in C++, 3rd Edition,_ ](http://www.mcp.com/sams/detail_sams.cfm?item=157169160X) Sams Publishing, Indianapolis, 1999, ISBN 0-57169-160-X. **Note:** There are a number of typographical errors in this book, mostly non-critical. I may try to compile a list of them with your help (let me know if you find one); unfortunately there is no list that is maintained by the publisher, as there is for the following text. 
  2. Berman, A.M., [ _Data Structures via C++: Objects by Evolution,_ ](http://www.rowan.edu/evolve) Oxford University Press, New York, 1997, ISBN 0-19-510843-4. **Note:** There are typographical errors in this text that you should be aware of. A list of them can be found at [ elvis.rowan.edu/evolve/errata.htm ](http://elvis.rowan.edu/evolve/errata.htm) 

**Compiler:** In this class we will be using the Borland C++Builder5.0
compiler as installed on the UMD file servers. You are welcome to use any
other compiler you want, but be warned that the instructor, TAs, consultants,
and Tutoring Center staff will not be able to give you any help with compiler-
specific problems with those compilers.

**Course Requirements:  
** You are responsible for reading the assigned textbook material and for the
material covered in class, including:

  1. doing the reading assignments (the current assignment and previous assignments will be posted on the class web page) 
  2. obtaining lecture notes 
  3. obtaining assignments and handouts 
  4. turning in programming assignments and homework  

If you are unable to attend a class meeting, it is your responsibility to
obtain class notes, assignments, and extra copies of handouts from your study
partner. **Note:** all assignments are due at the _beginning_ of class on the
due date. Programming assignments will be docked 25% per day if turned in
late. All assignments must have a typed cover sheet and  be stapled.

**Getting Help with Programming Assignments:  
** If you need help with a programming assignment, here is a list of
resources, which you should make use of in the following order:

  1. course materials, such as texts, notes, and previous lab assignments 
  2. your study partner (I encourage all students to get a study partner -- groups of 2 seem to work best). 
  3. TA's in HH 314, all of whom should know C++ 
  4. your own TA in HH 314 (who will definitely know C++) 
  5. a tutor at the [UMD Tutoring Center](http://www.d.umn.edu/tutoring) in Campus Center 40. They provide both free tutors and a list of private tutors. 
  6. the instructor 
There are several things to be noted. First, all lab assignments are to be
your own work -- there will be no group labs in this course. That doesn't mean
that you can't get any help at all, but you should not copy code from other
students. However, if you get stuck on some point in understanding the
assignment, or get a bug that you can't figure out, then it is all right to
ask your study partner.

Second, when you and your study partner get stuck on a bug that you can't
figure out, bring printouts of all your files (.cpp and .h files, and input
and output files, if any) and the error messages to the TA, tutor, or
instructor. Note that email is usually not an efficient way of conveying this
information.

Finally, use the instructor as a last resort after trying all the other
resources. The instructor simply doesn't have the time to correct things like
syntax errors for 200 students.

**Examinations and Grading:  
**

There will be two midterm exams, worth 100 points each and a final exam worth
200 points. These exams are closed book: -- among the questions, you will be
asked to write C++ code without the aid of any course materials or the text.
Exams will be handed back and discussed in the recitation sections.  If you
are unable to attend recitation the day exams are handed back and discussed,
you are encouraged to come review your exam during office hours with the TA.
The two-hour final examination is cumulative. It is Department of Computer
Science policy not to return final exams, however they are kept and you can
look at your exam in the instructor's office. There will be no make-up exams
without PRIOR consent of the instructor, and even then only under VERY unusual
circumstances.

**Note:** The grade of I (incomplete) can be given _only_ when (a) the student
has performed satisfactorily during most of the semester, and (b)the student
is unable to finish the semester's work on time for reasons beyond his or her
control. Students will not be assigned an incomplete solely for the purpose of
avoiding a poor grade. According to UMD policy:  
([ http://www.d.umn.edu/catalogs/current/umd/gen/grades.html
](http://www.d.umn.edu/catalogs/current/umd/gen/grades.html))  
the temporary grade I (incomplete) is assigned only when a student has made an
agreement with the instructor to complete the course requirements before the
instructor submits final grades for a semester.

Many of the exam questions will be discussed in the lectures and the
discussion sections. All the questions mentioned in the reading assignments
will be answered in the lectures.

Scores and total points will be posted periodically on the "` Grades`" page of
the class web site:  
[
http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs1521/grades](http://www.d.umn.edu/~ddunham/cs1521/grades)  
using the last four digits of your student id number. If you wish to have your
scores posted using a number other than your student id, you may email your
request to the instructor.

**Grading Procedures** Final grades are based on total points distributed
approximately as follows:

  * Labs and other assignments (approx. 400 to 450 points) 
  * Midterm Exam I (100 points) 
  * Midterm Exam II (100 points) 
  * Final Examination (200 points) 
Grades are assigned based on a percentage of the total points.

  * A- cutoff is 90% 
  * B- cutoff is 80% 
  * C- cutoff is 70% 
  * D cutoff is 60% 
  * F is below 60% 
These percentages may be lowered slightly but they will not be raised.

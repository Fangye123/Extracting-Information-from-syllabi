This course seeks to promote an understanding of the role played by the
aboriginal peoples of North America in the historical evolution of the United
States. Among the subjects to be covered through lectures and discussions:
initial migrations and cultural development; impact of European contact and
conquest; assimilation, acculturation, and adaptation; removal and reservation
life; 20th century adjustments. The course will consist of readings, lectures,
discussions, critical film viewing, and writing assignments. Grading will be
based on all written work, midterm and final examinations, and class
participation.

**GOALS  
** Students in the course will be expected to have a good understanding of the
following concepts and processes by the end of the semester:

  * Current theories on the origins of the aboriginal Western Hemisphere populations
  * Cultural diversity of North American Indian populations at the time of European contact
  * Varieties of contacts and relationships between Indians and Europeans
  * Development and implementation of U.S. government policies toward Indians
  * Indian resistance and accommodation strategies

**NOTE** : This syllabus and calendar are intended to provide you with all the
information necessary to successfully keep up with the course. Unless
expressly stated in class, the guidelines established herein are final.

**WRITING ASSIGNMENTS  
** There will be three writing assignments during the semester. Two consist of
4-5 page reviews of the required books and films. These are to be reviews, not
merely reports. The object of the review is to convey not merely what the
items being reviewed are about but why they written and/or created the way
they were, and how they relate to each other. Consequently, the following
elements should be addressed:

  * Clearly state the theme and scope of the book and film being reviewed--what are they about; what are the major arguments?
  * Why are you reviewing these works together? Compare and contrast the subjects of the related book and movie in order to give your reader a clear idea of the interrelationships, both thematic and artistic between book and film. 
  * Discuss the organization and contents of the book--is it chronologically or thematically organized; is the organization effective (does the book make sense or is it confusing), and why or why not? In the case of the films, what is the time frame within which the film takes place and does the narrative flow of the film make it understandable? 
  * Analyze the use of sources: In the case of the book, what is the nature of the evidence used in the book, does the author or editor recognize any biases, are specialized terms properly defined and statement of facts documented? In the case of the films, is the language and design (costumes, sets, scenery) appropriate to the time and place of the action portrayed, are characters clearly defined and representative of the culture(s) and time? 
  * Assess the value of the works--how do the book and films contribute to your body of knowledge; who might form an appropriate audience for these works?

The review should be no more than 1000 words long and should be formatted as
follows:

  * Typed (reasonably clean of "typos" and grammatical mistakes), double spaced, one-inch margins on all sides on all pages, stapled at the upper left-hand corner; 
  * In the case of the book: title of the work, author, place of publication, press, date at the top of the first page;  
  * In the case of the films: title of the movie, director, writer(s), studio(s), date of release, format viewed (VHS, DVD, edited, uncut);  
  * Skip four lines and begin the review; on the left margin at the end of the review your name, skip a line, the semester and class time (e.g. Spring 1995, 9 am).

**Failure to observe these rules will result in a lower grade.**

The third writing assignment is a essay review of one Web site dedicated to
some aspect of American Indian studies. This review is to be 7-10 pages long
and examine the site with regard to the following factors:

  * _Scope_ : what is the site about?
  * _Content_ : How does the material contained in the site address the scope?
  * _Objectivity_ : Is the site argumentative, fact oriented, emotional---how is the material presented?
  * _Sources_ : What type of information is the site grounded in? Primary, secondary, mix; are the sources employed clearly identified?
  * _Presentation_ : How is the site organized? How easy is it to find your way around it? How effective is the blend of text and visual/audio materials?
  * _Internet_ : How effectively is the site linked to others?
  * _Rating_ : Thumbs up/thumbs down? Five stars/no stars? What is your overall impression of the site? Why would you recommend/not recommend the site to someone interested in its subject matter?

**ASSESSMENT  
** Aside from the reviews and report noted above, students will be graded on
their performance in two tests, one at the midpoint of the semester and a
final exam, weekly quizzes of readings, and on class participation. Class
participation will be measured in terms overall attendance and contribution to
discussions.

Course: |

Midterm = 15%  
Final = 20%  
weekly chapter quiz 10 out of 12 passing = 20%  
reviews 2 @ 10% = 20%  
essay review = 20%  
class participation = 5%  
Total = 100%

**CLASS POLICIES**  
The following policies will be enforced rigorously. Exceptions will be made
only in documented cases of hardship or catastrophe:

**Withdrawal** : Withdrawals made after the "automatic W" date will carry with
them the appropriate grade. That is, if you withdraw while holding an F
average, your semester grade will be an F. Anyone holding a D or above will be
granted a W. It is **your** responsibility to withdraw from class. Anyone who
has stopped attending class but appears on the final grade roster will receive
a grade.

**Incomplete** : An incomplete will not be issued in the course except under
the conditions noted above. Failure to show up for an examination **does not**
constitute grounds for issuance of an I.

**Deadlines** : Deadlines are final. Work turned in after a deadline will be
subject to a one-half grade reduction per class-day late. It is **your**
responsibility to have all work in on time and to show up on examination dates
and times.

**Make-ups** : **THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAMINATIONS** , except for the
midterm, and only upon presentation of a doctor's note or similar evidence of
a catastrophic event. All midterm make-up exams will take place on the last
day of the semester- **no exceptions**.

**Attendance** : Students are expected to come to class. Attendance is taken
to substantiate presence in case some unforeseen situation should make such
data relevant. More than 4 absences will result in an automatic "0" for class
participation.

**Office hours** : Aside from announced and posted hours, I will be more than
happy to make special arrangements to see you. If, on a written assignment or
test, I request that you see me during office hours, make sure you do it.
Failing to meet with me when I so request will have significant consequences.

**Scholastic dishonesty** : Cheating is not acceptable. The instructor
reserves the right to issue a failing grade for the course for any act of
willful dishonesty, such as plagiarism, purchasing the preparation of a paper
that should be the student's own work, and use of unauthorized materials
during an examination. The instructor also reserves the right to impose any
lesser penalty for inadvertent infractions of these rules. This policy is
based on current SWT _Student Handbook_ section on scholastic dishonesty.

**Classroom Environment** : Students are expected and encouraged to have
intelligent and reasoned opinions on all course topics, and to participate in
discussions and debates. Students are also expected and required to respect
the opinions of others and to maintain civility and courtesy toward fellow
class members and the instructor.

**Students with disabilities** : Students with special needs (as documented by
the Office of Disability Services) must identify themselves at the beginning
of the semester.

**Computer Lab** : Use of the History Department computer lab is strongly
encouraged. The department's fully equipped lab includes both Macs and PCS.
There is scanning equipment available and all machines have Internet access.
Aside from the general department homepage, which includes sources for
historians, please check my homepage at **LINKS** for sites specifically
relevant to my courses.

Please remember the most important rule of all, **IGNORANCE IS NO EXCUSE**. If
you have a question, **ASK!**

**`NOTE:`**` Restricted admission, consent of instructor required.`

` This is a seminar course whose aim is to provide you with a broad overview
of the history of documentary and ethnographic cinemas. It seeks not only to
familiarize you with documentary and ethnographic film traditions but also to
problematize them. Thus, on occasions, both the canonical films and those that
deconstruct them will be examined. A number of significant film movements and
auteurs, major approaches worldwide, and some of the salient issues and
discourses about documentary and ethnographic films will be discussed. In the
ethnographic area, the works of the French filmmaker Jean Rouch, is
highlighted. The shifting and overlapping boundaries of fiction and nonfiction
is also examined. `

**`CLASS FORMAT:  
`**` Each class session consists of lecture, film screenings, student
presentations, and discussion. All the required screenings will occur during
the class sessions. However, occasionally you are required to attend Rice
Cinema and the Museum of Fine Arts' film screenings. Admittance to Rice Cinema
for students of this course is free of charge.`

![Newsgroup Info](news_info.gif) |

`A special electronic newsgroup has been setup for this course that requires
additional time and activity on your behalf. This component is still in its
experimental phases but it is intended to help the class explore the uses of
the Internet and its resources in teaching and learning media studies topics.`

![Assignments/Grading](assign.gif) |

Assignments for this course consist of students oral presentations to the
class, two take-home term papers, newsgroup participation, and weekly synopsis
of the readings. Oral presentations are to be based on the assigned materials
(readings and films). Topics will be assigned/chosen in the first class
session. Before each presentation, prepare a 3-4 page paper consisting of
analysis and critique of the topic. Distribute the paper to all class
participants. Your presentation should consist of two parts: history of
documentary and ethnographic films and analysis of specific films/issues
raised by the readings. It may also include demonstration and/or screening of
materials. You are encouraged to do outside readings to bolster your
presentations and to provide additional information to the class. Oral
presenters are expected to lead the discussion that follows their
presentation. For additional sources, consult the instructor and the reserve
shelf in Brown library.

The topic for the first term paper is assigned by the instructor. You can
choose your own topic for the final paper only in consultation with the
instructor. All papers must be typed double-space and include full
bibliographic and filmographic citations (use the MLA or the Chicago style).
Papers are due at the START of each class session. Failure to turn them in at
that time will result in lowering of the paper's grade.

At the beginning of each session, hand in a 1-2 page type-written summary of
that sessions assigned readings that highlights the main points of each
reading.

The course grade will be based on the grades for term papers, oral
presentations, synopsis of the readings, newsgroup participation, and your
attendance and participation in class discussions. The maximum length of the
oral and written assignments, their due dates, and grade value are noted in
the chart below.

|  `ASSIGNMENTS` |  `PAGES ` |  `DUE DATE` |  `GRADE VALUE`  
---|---|---|---  
`Oral presentations` |  `60 min.` |  `as scheduled` |  `15% of class grade`  
`Term paper` |  `7-10` |  `Week 7 (3/2)` |  `30%`  
`Final paper` |  `12-18` |  `Last Week (5/6)` |  40%  
`Attendance/participation` |  - |  - |  10%  
`Computer newsgroup` |  - |  `Weekly` |  5%

**`PLAGIARISM:  
`**` The honor code rules! If you directly quote or paraphrase a source, so

is an important part of your research activity and your notes will become a
key resource when writing papers on specific films.`

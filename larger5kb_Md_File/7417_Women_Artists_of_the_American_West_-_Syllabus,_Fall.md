West? This introductory essay provides a historical framework from which to
approach the course content. It includes an overview of the scholarly
literature on women's art and proposes alternatives to canonically "male"

experience of women quilters from the Hispanic and "Anglo" traditions. It is
both historical and biographical, telling multi-layered stories through the
voices of the women, collected by Dorothy Zopf and accompanied by her own art
and experiences.

> Part of a forthcoming book, this essay looks at the historical phenomenon of
white women's promotion of Native arts and crafts from an ideological
perspective, questioning notions of authenticity as well as what constituted
"a new vision of womanhood" in the early modern American West.

Museums, Albuquerque)

>>

>> First published in _American Art Review,_ December 1997, this essay was
revised to focus on the two women members of the Transcendental Painting
Group. Blankenship situates "spirituality" within an historical and
philosophical context ("...terms such as spiritual, transcendental, quality,
or ideal were part of the transcendental dialogue...") and defines the
movement from the women members' points of view.

Photography"](http://www.sla.purdue.edu/waaw/Sandweiss/index.html)**  
>  (Martha A. Sandweiss, historian - Amherst College, Amherst, Massachussetts)  
> First published in _The Desert is No Lady_ (ed. by Vera Norwood and Janice
Monk, 1987), this study considers what the term  "landscape" might mean from a
woman's point of view. According to Sandweiss, Laura Gilpin's commitment to
chronicling the Southwestern landscape probably exceeded any other woman's in
the history of American photography. Since landscape photography emerged from
a male tradition, Gilpin's _oeuvre_ can therefore suggest new ways of looking
at this genre. Professor Sandweiss will share her current research on this
topic during her presentation.

> The Women in Photography International Archive (WIP) contains a vast
collection of resources on women photographers. In WAAW, these collections are
represented by a broad overview, gallery and bibliographic references, as well
as two essays: one on California women photographers and the other on women
who photographed the American Indian. A total of nineteen photographers are
discussed, and the materials compiled on them are extensive. Students will
focus on selected photographers and their essays, contextualized by historical
documents such as ["Women's Work: Women in the Arts in Humboldt County,
1900-1920,"](http://www.sla.purdue.edu/waaw/Palmquist/Photographers/FreemanEssay2.htm)
which raises issues concerning women's social and artistic status that are
still relevant today.

>> "Asian American Artists," is an archive of women artists who self-identify
as Asian American and have organized to promote more visibility for their
communities in the art world. The Asian American collections in WAAW focus on
a dozen women whose diverse artworks and philosophies coalesce around
differing interpretations of Asian American community, identity, spirituality,
and locality. Students will focus on selected artists' statements and essays
to facilitate discussion of their art.

>>

>> Barbara Zaring and Alyce Frank have been painting the Southwestern
landscape together for more than twenty years. Kate O'Neill's study looks at
their artistic partnership and queries whether women's collaborations are
often acknowledged or culturally validated. She suggests that the stereotype
of the "lone artist-genius" is a male model based on hierarchy and
competition, and that women's creative partnerships can provide a more
egalitarian and collaborative model.

>>

>> First published in the catalog to the traveling exhibition of the same name
(mounted at the National Museum of Women in the Arts and the Heard Museum in
1997-8), this collection focuses on ten Native American women potters whom
Peterson calls the "Avant-Garde." This modernist term, based on innovation and
the overthrow of past traditions, here refers to a contemporary generation of
artists who "have one foot in their relatively closed Indian environment and
one foot in an open Anglo society." In this context, the American Indian
"avant-garde" faces unprecedented challenges to their artistic and cultural
identities.

>>

>> "The lack of a publicly accessible history is a devastating form of
oppression," begins Tee Corinne's essay on lesbian west coast photography.
This essay, documenting thirty lesbian photographers who have lived and worked
on the U.S. west coast during the past twenty - five years, is an important
step towards establishing that much needed history. Corinne's essay is
accompanied by a unique collection of artists' materials, including
statements, biographies, and bibliographic references. A list of critics and
commentators is appended, along with several selected additional essays, thus
providing a rich resource for further research.

diverse interpretations of spiritual traditions and practices. From New
Mexican Santeras (women saintmakers) to "Becoming a Bee Priestess" (Nancy
Macko's exploration of women, nature and technology), this collection looks at
the rich cultural diversity that characterizes women's spiritual art in the
American West.

>>

>> Terri Cohn presents twelve San Francisco Bay area artists whose work brings
"Nature" and "Culture" into the public eye through a broad range of public
arts projects. Regionally based within this "diverse" locale, Cohn finds it
"logical" that "women have worked within the public sector with environmental
issues and with at-risk populations...as they [women artists] tend to be
concerned with a holistic integration of the roles art can play in the world
at large." Thus, this essay situates activist art within a spiritual context,
where artists can serve as "social commentators, historians, architects,
teachers and shamans."

>> Corinne Whitaker is a digital artist for whom "Art...is an act of love." In
this autobiographical meditation on her art and life, Whitaker invites readers
to join her in the journey into one's "deepest self." She says that the
"process" is more important "than the tool or product," and that an artist
needs "three essential pieces of software: hand, head, and heart." Whitaker
reveals her personal connection with the four course themes in this profusely
illustrated and poetic essay.

>> Betty LaDuke is a painter who has traveled extensively and made her home in
many cultures around the world. In this autobiographical essay, LaDuke takes
us on a multi-cultural tour where life and art intersect on many levels,
including that of food, which like art, sustains life. She says," I have
included food as an eclectic cultural guide in the retelling of the
intersection of my life and art around the following themes: Identity . . .
Community . . . Spirituality . . . Locality." In this fitting conclusion to
Women Artists of the American West, Betty LaDuke shares her vision of "what it
is to be human in this world today."

>>

>> In this biographical essay, Jensen explores the art and life of Helen Hyde,
"one of the best known and most successful American printmakers of the early
twentieth century." Emphasis is on a more "careful" and "critical" re-
evaluation of Hyde's work in the contexts of today's "renewed interest in the
history of American printmaking, turn-of-the-century female art worlds, and
the transfer of Asian artistic traditions to the Americas."

>> Jensen's essay is about the cultural "messages" that have always been an
integral part of native women's art. She says that as Native women have "added
cameras" to the more traditional arts of fiber and clay, their work has
"formed a critique" and told a "different story." Rather than "vanishing,"
these women's stories are of "a lively, assertive group of people confident
about the importance of their cultures in the past, their importance to the
present, and their influence on the future."

>> "A sense of place or a response to the art of a place may give a group of
seemingly diverse people a common experience that allows them to form a type
of community." According to Joan Jensen, the women artists, collectors, and
consumers of art of the Pacific Rim comprise such a community - "a place where
women have been able to explore their own identity and the cultural heritage
of Asia . . . whose artistic traditions have so influenced those of the
American West."

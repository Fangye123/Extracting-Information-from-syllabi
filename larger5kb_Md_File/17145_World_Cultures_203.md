# **World Cultures 203: The Modern World**

* * *

During the past two centuries, movements and ideas have opened the world to
greater and greater possibilities. The price has been a loss of the certainty
which comforted previous generations. In this final semester of the [World
Cultures](http://www.evansville.edu/showcase/wc.html) sequence, we will study
some of those ideas and events that are shaping our present world. We will
also consider some of the problems which present themselves to us for
solution.

This course does not endorse a specific point of view, nor does it endorse a
specific solution. It seeks instead to provide the opportunity for students to
gain perspective and insight so that they may form their own approaches to the
issues they will face.

World Cultures 203 has been organized into an Introduction followed by four
main topics for study. This site was designed to assist students and
instructors who wish to find additional information about the topics covered
in the course. Information for each of the topics is presented on a separate
page. The icons shown below provide direct links to those pages. Each of the
topic pages contains additional links to sites on the Internet that offer
texts, biographies, photographs, and other information related to the concepts
discussed within that topic.

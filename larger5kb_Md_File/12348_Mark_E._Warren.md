**Course Schedule**

**Fall 2002:  
**_GOVT 358 Continental Political Thought_ ([Syllabus](govt358f02.pdf))  
An introduction to central issues of late modern and contemporary continental
political thought through the writings of Kant, Hegel, Nietzsche, Weber,
Arendt, and Habermas. The course follows critics of Enlightenment rationalism,
and looks at their impact on key concepts of political theory, such as power,
responsibility, ideology, democracy, dialogue, and community.

_GOVT 449 Theories of State & Society_ ([Syllabus](govt449f02.pdf))  
This course surveys classical origins of contemporary theories of the state in
Smith, Tocqueville, Marx, and Weber, and relates these origins to several of
the contemporary debates about state-society relations. We will be concerned
the explanatory claims of these theories and as well as their normative
assumptions. From an explanatory perspective, these theories focus on
relations between the society and state: How does social power relate to
political power? How do different kinds of states sustain classes, status
groups, and distributions of values in society? How does state power relate to
political culture and ideology? When and why do states change? How autonomous
are states with respect to society? How important are states as locations of
politics in an era characterized by globalization and decentralization? From a
normative perspective, these theories view modern states as problematic in
different ways according to the values states secure or undermine-values such
as order, justice, community, wealth, democracy, and self-development.

**Recently Taught Courses**

**Spring 2002:  
**_PHIL 099 Political and Social Thought_ ([Syllabus](PHIL099S02.pdf))  
This course introduces basic problems of political and social thought by
examining several major political thinkers. We will be especially interested
in questions such as these: What kinds of problems are "political"? That is,
what problems can be, and ought to be, dealt with by means of collective
action? What values, goods, and goals ought to be reflected in political life?
How must political institutions be arranged to realize these values, goods,
and goals? In what ways are political possibilities limited by intrinsic and
historically variable aspects of the world in which we live? For example, does
material scarcity inevitably lead to conflict? Do properties of human nature
limit cooperation? How do distributions of wealth affect political
arrangements? Each thinker we study in this course provides a different set of
answers to questions such as these. Through our "conversations" with each
thinker, we will seek to develop thoughtful and informed opinions about the
nature, goals, and limits of political life.

****_GOVT 706 Political Theory Research Seminar_ ([Syllabus](govt706S02.pdf))  
Democratic theory has been developing rapidly over the last three decades,
spurred by the third wave of democratization, by intensifying problems of
democracy within the established liberal democracies, as well as by a growing
awareness that many of the traditional conceptions of democracy have limited
relevance to today's complex, large-scale, pluralistic societies. Contemporary
democratic theory is now diverse, expansive, and exciting, and offers multiple
opportunities to combine normatively significant problems with empirical
research. This seminar aims to provide the stimulus and opportunity to explore
some of these connections. To this end, we shall devote the first part of the
seminar to an overview of traditional and received problems in democratic
theory. In the second part, we shall explore the relationship between
pluralism, the politics of identity, and liberal democracy. In the third part,
we investigate two emerging theories of deliberative democracy. The final part
of seminar is devoted to the research and theorizing of seminar participants.
Readings from David Held, Charles Taylor, Will Kymlicka, J¨¹rgen Habermas, and
Iris Young.

**_PHIL 099 Political and Social Thought_ ([Syllabus](SYL-099-2000.pdf))  
This course introduces basic problems of political and social thought by
examining several major political thinkers. We will be especially interested
in questions such as these: What kinds of problems are "political"? That is,
what problems can be, and ought to be, dealt with by means of collective
action? What values, goods, and goals ought to be reflected in political life?
How must political institutions be arranged to realize these values, goods,
and goals? In what ways are political possibilities limited by intrinsic and

_GOVT 706 Political Theory Minor Seminar_ **** ([Syllabus](SYL-706-2000.pdf))  
Democratic theory has been developing rapidly over the last three decades,
spurred by the third wave of democratization, by intensifying problems of
democracy within the established liberal democracies, as well as by a growing
awareness that many of the traditional conceptions of democracy have limited
relevance to today's complex, large-scale, pluralistic societies. Contemporary
democratic theory is now diverse, expansive, and exciting, and offers multiple
opportunities to combine normatively significant problems with empirical
research. This seminar aims to provide the stimulus and opportunity to explore
some of these connections. To this end, we shall devote the first part of the
seminar to an overview of traditional and received problems in democratic
theory, followed by a short discussion of the relationship between democracy
and capitalism. The second part of the seminar is devoted to understanding two
of the most important thinkers in contemporary liberal democratic political
theory, John Rawls and J¨¹rgen Habermas. These thinkers are distinguished by
their departure from "foundational" approaches to political thought: both
recognize the autonomy of politics in complex, pluralistic societies. In
distinctive ways, both seek to redefine liberal democratic theory with an
emphasis on political processes and institutions, while attending closely to
their social conditions and normative justifications. We shall devote the
third part of the seminar to the research and theorizing of seminar
participants.

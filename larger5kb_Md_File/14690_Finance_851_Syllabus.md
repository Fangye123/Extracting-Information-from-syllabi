**_Overview / Objectives_**

Finance 851 is the second corporate finance class for MBAs. The course is
intended to give you a framework for understanding the determinants of
corporate investment, financing, leasing, insurance, and dividend policies. As
such, my focus will tend not be on the memorization of institutional detail or
results from academic research, but rather, on developing your ability to
think critically about issues related to corporate financial policy.

**_Required Text_**

  * Smith, _The Modern Theory of Corporate Finance, 2 nd Ed._, McGraw-Hill, New York, NY (1990).
  * Chew, _The New Corporate Finance: Where Theory Meets Practice_ , McGraw-Hill, New York, NY (1993).

_Class Participation Grading:_  
Active class participation is an important part of Finance 851.  The goal of
class participation is not to see who can "come up with the answer the teacher
is looking for," but rather, to learn from one another.  We each bring
different experiences and backgrounds to the class.  We each have different
ways of thinking about the sorts of issues we'll be addressing.  My goal, as I
said above, is to expose you to a particular framework for thinking about
those issues.  It is not "bad" for you to subscribe to a different way of
thinking (i.e., you wont be graded down).  The only "bad" outcome is if a lack
of participation leads us to miss an opportunity to learn from one another.

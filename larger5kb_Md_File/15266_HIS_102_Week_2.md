  **Summary** :  
During the seventeenth century, England and France underwent divergent
political evolutions.  While absolutism emerged powerful in France, a
constitutional system developed in England.  This set the stage for over two
centuries of rivalry between the two countries and between conservative and
liberal forces throughout the Western world.  Liberals consistently championed
the English constitutional system as a model, while conservatives favored the
example of the French monarchy.

**Directions** :  
Read the [English Bill of Rights](../documents/English.html) (along with the
document background information and suggested study questions).  Before you
read the document, please read the [Sample Historical Document
Analysis](../../resources/document.html), if you have not already done so.
The sample illustrates some of the questions that a historian asks as he/she
reads a historical document.  Then, using a word processor, type a paragraph
(double-spaced, one-inch margins, font size 10 or 12) that answers the
following question:  Was the English Bill of Rights a democratic document?
Please follow the [Writing Style Rules](../../resources/style.html) and the
[History Paper Guidelines](../../resources/guidelines.html).  Please also
check the [Sample Writing Style Mistakes](../../resources/mistakes.html).
After receiving your graded paper, you can check the [Explanation of Comments
on Assignments](../../resources/comments.html).  This exercise will be your
first as historians in this course.  The short paragaph requires that you
gather evidence from a textual source (the English Bill of Righst to
reconstruct the past (task 1), and that you then interpret that past by
analyzing the evidence (task 2).   You may also wish to participate in an [
Online Discussion](javascript:Start\('../../Forums.htm'\)) of this week's
assignment.  (Information about your username/password can be found on the
course quick-start syllabus mailed to you by the ELI staff when you enrolled
in the course.  You can also check the [Help](../../Resources/Help.html) link
at the top of this page.)  During the course, you **MUST** post at least one
of your assignments to a web discussion forum and respond to the posting of
another student; it does not have to be this assignment.   This assignment
should be sent by e-mail according to the [Electronic Submission
Information](../../resources/submission.html) instructions.   Back to Table of

:  
Louis XIV, king of France from 1643 to 1715, was the premier example of the
absolute European monarch.  As king, Louis concentrated as much power as
possible in his hands at the expense of the French nobility, which he deeply
mistrusted (French nobles had revolted against, and threatened the life of,
the king in 1648 in a movement known as le Fronde).  Louis XIV came to be
known as the sun king:  just as everything in the solar system revolved around
the sun, so too did everything in France and Europe revolve around him; just
as the sun was the source of life, so too was Louis the source of all power.
Louis even had a picture of the rising sun painted on his chair to symbolize
the connection.

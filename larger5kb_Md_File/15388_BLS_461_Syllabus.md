> In addition to the Civil War, the Great Depression, and World War II, the
1960s arguably constitute one of the historical and cultural watersheds of
American history, and certainly have altered forever the course of American
history and culture. Using original and secondary sources, we will explore the
most turbulent decade of the twentieth century, examining the intersections of
the civil rights, women's, and gay rights movements; the Cold War; the space
race; the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon administrations; and figures and forces
in popular culture, including television, film, and folk and rock-and-roll
music. We will focus particularly on the connections between ideas and culture
in the 1960s.

>

> We will take an interdisciplinary, American studies approach to the
material, drawing from history, culture studies, literary studies, political
science, and sociology to achieve a complex understanding of the sometimes
bewildering forces that constituted the 1960s. Along the way, we will examine
"meta-issues" involved in the American studies approach to culture, such as
historiographical debates regarding the "meaning" of the 1960s decade, its
precursors, and its legacy. For example, did the 1960s mark the end of a
constrained, culturally infertile, and undemocratic period that oppressed
women and minorities, or were the 1960s the beginning of the end of a formerly
great nation that understood its purpose and its place in the international
scene? Were they a time of liberation, or a time characterized by a consumer
culture that has sentenced future generations to the amoral purposelessness of
late capitalism?

>

> By the end of this course, you should be able to analyze, with detail and
complexity, the intersecting forces of the 1960s, and to apply the
interdisciplinary methods of American studies to such analyses. In other
words, you are developing, simultaneously, historical and cultural knowledge
and the skills to understand it. You also will hone your speaking and writing
abilities and your use of technology in the pursuit of understanding and the
communication of ideas.

>

> Students are encouraged to complete one upper-division course in American
literature, history, or film before taking this course. Liberal Studies
students should not register for this or any other 400-level course until they
have completed at least one core course.

> A note about grades: I know that students often need to juggle school, work,
family, and other obligations. I never second-guess students' priorities, and
I never think less of students who choose to devote more time and effort to
one of these other obligations rather than to an assignment or the course as a
whole. I respect the maturity of students who establish their priorities, make
difficult choices, and accept the consequences of those decisions. Also,
remember that your grade is based solely on my professional assessment of the
quantity and quality of your work, not on your effort or on my opinion of you
as an individual.

> The [final examination](Sixties461Final.html) will be held 8:45 to 10:50
a.m. on **Tuesday, March 19**. Mark it on your calendar _now_ ; it cannot be
made up if missed. This schedule is subject to change. The most current
schedule will always be posted here
<http://faculty.washington.edu/davidgs/Sixties461syl.html> for your reference,
and changes will be announced in class, by e-mail, or both.

>

> Keep a copy of all submitted work. No extra credit or paper re-writes will
be permitted except as noted, but I will gladly assist you with your work. In-
class exercises cannot be made up for any reason because the group interaction
is irreproducible. Late assignments will be accepted only in extenuating
circumstances that could not have been anticipated, and only as specified;
penalties will apply as specified. Keep all graded materials; you will need
them for your graduation portfolio.

>

> In accordance with University policy, I give Incompletes only if you are
passing the course and attending class to within two weeks of the end of the
quarter, and then only in extenuating circumstances that can be proven.

>

> I will do my best to accommodate all documented disabilities. See
<[http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/dss/index.html](http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/dss/index.html)>
for information.

>

> I am very strict about deadlines, for two reasons: (1) I have very limited
grading time, and late papers make it hard for me to return graded papers in a
timely manner; and (2) I want everyone to have exactly the same amount of work
time for the sake of fairness. Please do not put me in the position of trying
to decide arbitrarily how late is "late." Take responsibility for getting work
to me _at the beginning of class when it is due_ , not ten minutes, two hours,
or a day later. I want your work, not your reasons for lateness. Rest assured
that everyone is being treated equally.

>

> ![](alert.gif) IMPORTANT: I insist on academic integrity. You are
responsible for understanding all aspects of University regulations regarding
academic integrity. Breaches of academic integrity, including but not limited
to **cheating** (e.g., copying another person's work or obtaining examination
answers in a dishonest manner) and **plagiarism** (i.e., using another
person's words or ideas without proper acknowledgment), _whether intentional
or accidental_ , will result in a zero for the assignment or examination;
additional sanctions may be imposed by the University administration. Note
that American rules regarding plagiarism might differ markedly from those in
other countries. You can find more information in the University Handbook and
in the document, "Avoiding Academic Misconduct"
<[http://faculty.washington.edu/davidgs/Integrity.html](http://faculty.washington.edu/davidgs/Integrity.html)>.
I will help you any way I can so you can succeed while maintaining academic
integrity. I truly want you to do well. Visit my office hours often!

>

> This course requires the use of e-mail and the World Wide Web. You _must_
obtain a UW Net ID (for using various UW services) _and_ a UWB NT account (for
using UWB campus computers). Go to
<[http://www.bothell.washington.edu/library/newstudent.html](http://www.bothell.washington.edu/library/newstudent.html)>
for instructions for obtaining a UW Net ID and a UWB NT account. Remember your
passwords!

>

> Starting no later than noon on Thursday, January 10, you are required to
check your e-mail account at least once a week (i.e., do not let more than
seven days pass without checking) and to read all messages except the ones
marked "Opt." in the subject line. Note that you can check University e-mail
accounts anywhere you have access to the World Wide Web, including public
libraries, by using MyUW
<[http://myuw.washington.edu](http://myuw.washington.edu)>. **Important:** If
you do not usually use your UW e-mail account, _immediately_ have it forwarded
to one that you check regularly by following the simple directions at MyUW
<[http://myuw.washington.edu](http://myuw.washington.edu)>. (Click on "UW Net
ID Resources" and then on "Change your forwarding.") As noted in your Student
Handbook, the University and I have only your official UW e-mail address and
will send all mail to it, so you will miss important messages if you do not
have them forwarded to an account you check regularly.

>

> **About participation:**

>

> Students learn at least as much from one another as from their instructors.
I consider class participation to be a critical component of every course, so
it also is a critical component of your grade.

>

> When we meet in small groups, I will provide you with a sign-in list. Each
time you participate in your small group discussion, you will earn a few
participation points. Note that if you are absent, you cannot earn these
points, because they are based on contributions in a group setting. Most of
the available participation points will be earned in this manner. I also
expect occasional contributions to online discussions. I will make it clear
when I expect an online response.

>

> In emergent, unforeseeable circumstances (e.g., significant illness) or for
religious holidays, I might grant an "excused" absence, in which case a missed
group excercise will not count against you. To request an excused absence,
[contact
me](http://depts.washington.edu/ctlt/catalyst/umail/mail.cgi?user=davidgs&form=5)
by e-mail within a week and explain your absence. Be prepared to provide proof
if requested. If I excuse the absence, I will deduct that day's number of
available points from the total number of points for which you are responsible
at the end of the course. For example, if you miss a three-point exercise, I
will divide the total number of points you earn by 197 instead of 200 at the
end of the course. I will not excuse absences related to work, other
coursework, traffic, computer problems, chronic health problems not registered
with Disabled Student Services
<[http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/dss/index.html](http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/dss/index.html)>,
minor illnesses, or typical family matters like childcare. I am quite
sympathetic to such problems, but I expect students to set their own
priorities and to take responsibility for the consequences of choices. If you
expect significant conflicts throughout the quarter, you should consider
taking this course at another time. If continuing issues arise in the middle
of the quarter, you might wish to contact Student Affairs
<[http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/](http://www.bothell.washington.edu/students/)>
to discuss a hardship withdrawal. I will excuse no more than ten points for
any student in a course.

> If you miss a class in which an assignment is due, you are responsible for
getting the assignment to me by e-mail as an attachment (if your assignment is
in Microsoft Word) by the _beginning_ of class time on the due date. It is
your responsibility to learn how to send an attachment if you do not already
know how to do so; it is fairly easy. (I will make exceptions only for
extreme, unpredictable circumstances that prevent you from getting the
assignment to me on time.) If you miss a class in which I return graded work,
you are responsible for arranging the return of your work. In courses with
scheduled or unscheduled ("pop") quizzes, quizzes cannot be made up, but in
most courses, I disregard the lowest quiz grade, so a missed quiz would be
that disregarded grade. Just be sure you do not miss any others.

>

> Note that I do not grade on attendance, but on participation. However,
numerous absences inevitably decrease your level of participation. Moreover,
although most of the media used in class are available on reserve at the Media
Center
<[http://www.bothell.washington.edu/media/](http://www.bothell.washington.edu/media/)>,
you are much better off watching or listening to them in class and
participating in discussing them.

>

> I will give a few "discretionary" participation points at the end of the
course based on your own self-evaluation and on my observation of your
participation in whole-class discussions. I know that some students are
reluctant to speak in a large group. I understand the fear of speaking out,
but I also strongly believe that when everyone contributes, everyone learns
more; I want you to share your ideas. My courses provide an opportunity to
face and overcome your reticence. Your classmates and I will do our best to be
friendly and respectful! College is the time to take some calculated risks in
order to grow. In this effort and in all others in the course, I expect
excellence from you.

> Welcome to the course!

>

> **If you need to drop:** You and I both invest a significant amount of time
and effort having you in this course, so it is unfortunate when students do
not complete a course that they began, especially a course in which other
students were denied entry. Sometimes, however, students need to drop a course
for good reasons. If that should become the case, you can drop the course by
following University procedures as outlined in the Student Handbook (or ask
one of the IAS counselors for assistance). I also ask, as a favor, that you
send me an e-mail message notifying me. Of course, I hope everyone who starts
the course can complete it, so your work and time and mine are put to good
use!

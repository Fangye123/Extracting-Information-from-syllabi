  **_Osteoporosis is a weakening of the bones that can cause hip or other
fractures. People with spinal cord injuries need to work hard to keep their
bones strong, because they are at higher risk than able-bodied people for
osteoporosis.   _**

  **Tips about taking calcium supplements**  
---  
Read the label.  Over-the-counter supplements are not the same. The amount of
calcium differs among products.  
Avoid calcium supplements with dolomite or bone meal. They might contain very
small amounts of lead and other metals.  
Take calcium supplements as intended -- as a supplement and not as your only
important source of calcium.  Although supplements may boost calcium intake,
they don't provide other nutrients your bones need, like vitamin D, magnesium,
phosphorus, and boron. Milk, for example, provides vitamin D, which helps
deposit calcium in your bones.  
If you take both calcium and iron supplements, take them at different times of
the day. They'll each be better absorbed when taken on their own.  
If you take two or three tablets daily, space them throughout the day. That
way, they'll be absorbed better.  
Drink plenty of fluids with calcium supplements to avoid constipation.  
If you take your calcium supplement with milk, the lactose and vitamin D in
the milk can help to enhance the absorption of the calcium.

  **Vitamin D is necessary for optimal calcium absorption.   Below are sources
of vitamin D. 400 IU per day is recommended for adults ages 51 through 70
years 600 IU per day for adults over 70 years of age.**

**Source of vitamin D** | **Amount of vitamin   D (IUs)**  
---|---  
Sunlight (see explanation below) | Your body can make its own vitamin D if
it's exposed to sunlight  
Vitamin D-fortified milk (8 oz) | 100  
Cod liver oil  (1 tablespoon) | 1360  
Salmon (3 oz) | 425  
Herring (3 oz) | 765  
Shrimp, canned (3 oz) | 90  
Sardines, canned (3 oz) | 255  
Cereal, fortified (1 serving: usually 1 cup)  | 40 to 50  
Egg yolk  | 25  
  
  **Additional information about Vitamin D:**

Sunlight exposure provides most people with their entire vitamin D
requirement. Children and young adults who spend a short time outside two or
three  
times a week will generally synthesize all the vitamin D they need.  Elderly
individuals have diminished capacity to synthesize vitamin D from sunlight
exposure, and  
frequently use sunscreen or protective clothing in order to prevent skin
cancer and sun damage. The application of sunscreen with an SPF factor of 8
reduces  
production of vitamin D by 95%.

In latitudes around 40 degrees north or 40 degrees south (Boston is 40 degrees
north), there is insufficient UVB light available for vitamin D synthesis from
November to early March. Ten degrees farther north or south (Edmonton, Canada)
this "vitamin D winter" extends from mid October to mid March.

A survey of elderly people who took a multivitamin supplement or drank 3
glasses of milk daily found that about 80% of them were vitamin D deficient by
the end of winter. These findings have led some experts to recommend small
amounts of regular sun exposure to elderly individuals*.

About 15 minutes of exposure on the hands, face, and forearms three times a
week in the morning or late afternoon during the spring, summer, and fall
should provide adequate vitamin D and allow for storage of any excess in fat
for use during the winter with minimal risk of skin damage.  A sunscreen may
be applied after the 15 minutes, if additional sun exposure is planned.

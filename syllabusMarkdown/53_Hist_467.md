**History 467/567  
The United States West in the 20th Century  
Spring Quarter 2002  
**

This course offers an overview of the history of the U.S. West in the 20th
century, covering the migration and immigration of the various peoples of the
modern West, the development of state and federal power, the incorporation of
"Old West" economies into a modern global economy, and the politics of race,
ethnicity, and gender in a region that is now, and in many respects always has
been, a national and international crossroads.

_**Books**_

The following books are required for the course. They are available at the
University Bookstore and/or on reserve at Knight Library:

> > William Deverell and Anne Hyde, **_The West in the History of the
Nation_** , v. 2  
>  Linda Gordon, **_The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction  
>  _** Marc Reisner, **_Cadillac_** _ **Desert: The American West and Its
Disappearing Water  
>  ** _ Nancy Woloch, _**Muller v. Oregon:   A Brief History with Documents**_  
>  Bruce Schulman, _**Lyndon B. Johnson and American Liberalism**  
>  _ Peter Iverson _, **" We are Still Here": American Indians in the
Twentieth Century** _

**_

Requirements_**

Students are expected to complete the assigned readings by the  beginning of
each week of class. Class attendance is required; roll will be taken
frequently and attendance is taken into account in determining course grades.
In addition to attending class and completing the readings, undergraduate
students will be required to take in-class [_midterm and final
exams_](newpage1.htm) (both exams will be part essay and part short
identification) and to write an analytic [ book review](book_review.htm).
Graduate students (enrolled in History 567) will have different requirements,
which are spelled out in my discussion of [History 567](newpage2.htm).

_**Grades**_

Grades will be figured along a curve on a scale of points divided as follows:
100 points for the midterm, 125 points for the book review, 150 points for the
final exam, and 40 points for attendance, for a total of 415 possible points.

_**

Course Policies**_

The dates for the exams and the book review are clearly marked on the
syllabus. Late papers will receive reduced grades, and I will consider
requests for makeup exams only in cases of emergency and only when requests
are made before the scheduled exam date. I will arrange for an "incomplete"
grade for the course only in the most unusual of circumstances. Its much
easierbelieve meto meet the deadlines than to try to argue for an exception,
so begin now to schedule time to complete the class readings and meet all the
deadlines.

In this class, as in any other, students are responsible for meeting all the
standards set by the UO Policy on Academic Dishonesty.  For more information,
see the [UO Policy on Academic
Dishonesty.](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~conduct/sai.htm)

Class Policies
Attendance:
  Southwestern's on-campus academic program is designed as an in-class learning 
  experience. In this type of instructional setting, the ability to pass examinations 
  and complete outside projects is only a partial measure of the student's knowledge, 
  skills, understanding, and appreciation of the subject matter. Therefore, students 
  are required to maintain regular and punctual class attendance.
Absences which exceed twenty percent (20%) of the number of times that a class 
  meets per semester, (9 absences for classes meeting 3 times per week; 6 absences 
  for classes meeting 2 times per week; and 3 absences for classes meeting 1 time 
  per week), regardless of the nature or reason for the absences, will result 
  in the student being administratively dropped automatically from the course, 
  receiving a grade of "W". The student will be assessed the established 
  course withdrawal fee.
 A student who is absent from a class is totally responsible to make the appropriate 
  advanced arrangements with the faculty member for possible make up work. The 
  faculty member will have the prerogative to determine if a student may make 
  up any examinations or outside assignments based upon the reason for a student's 
  absence and when the make up work must be completed. However, no point reduction 
  will be assessed to a student's final grade for absenteeism.
Tardy
  Student's missing fifteen minutes of a class will be counted absent for that 
  session. Every three tardies acquired in classes that meet three times a week 
  and every two tardies acquired in classes that meet twice a week will be considered 
  as an absence. The student is responsible, at the end of class, to identify 
  his/her tardiness to the professor.
NOTE: the assessment of a tardy also applies to students who leave class early.
Assignments
  All class assignments should be completed with due consideration for the professional 
  work expected of students of this university. Work should be neat, organized, 
  typewritten (when appropriate) with double line spacing, pages properly joined 
  and numbered, and an appropriate title page. Students should as a matter of 
  course proofread their work prior to turning it in to the instructor so that 
  typographical, grammatical, and syntactical errors may be corrected. It is also 
  advisable that students make a photocopy of work being turned in to provide 
  for coverage of potential error in processing.
Late Work
  Late work will be accepted, but the grade will be lowered by ten percent for 
  each class day the assignment is late.
Academic Dishonesty and Cheating
  Students are expected to be honest in fulfilling all academic requirements and 
  assignments. This pertains to examinations, themes, book critiques, reading 
  reports, etc. A student will not be allowed to withdraw from a course if he/she 
  is under investigation for academic dishonesty. In the event that the students 
  is determined guilty of academic dishonesty, then the student will not be allowed 
  to withdraw from the course and will receive the grade determined by the faculty 
  member, either "F" for the assignment and/or and "F" for 
  the course. Dishonesty could possibly result in further disciplinary action. 
  Refer to Major infractions in the Student Handbook.
Plagiarism, the use of another's uncited material, as one's own, is not permissible. 
  Reproducing material from other students by photocopy, computer media transfer 
  or by rewriting or cheating.
Miscellaneous
  Students must wait 15 minutes for a faculty member before leaving class unless 
  they have been notified otherwise.
Study Tips
Take careful notes in class. Set aside uninterrupted time to regularly review 
  your notes. Type your lecture notes while they are fresh. Note area that are 
  incomplete and use your textbook to fill in the gaps. If you are unable to find 
  the answer, ask the professor. Complete all reading assignments and study helps 
  as scheduled. The process of reading, applying, and review will enhance your 
  ability to retain the material. Do not wait until test time to prepare. This 
  adds pressure and seldom results in long-term memory. Be prepared for matching, 
  multiple choice, and completion.

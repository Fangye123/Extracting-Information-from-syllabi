**Course Description**  
  
> This course provides an introduction to the use of technology in educational
settings. Instructional uses of technology will be explored and tied to
current theories of learning to help educators make decisions about how to
effectively integrate the use of technology across content areas. Students
will learn to use a variety of technological applications to support teaching
and learning.

>

>  
  
**Purpose**  
  
> The purpose of this course is for you to develop an understanding of what it
means to be a teacher who integrates technology into the curriculum in order
to provide a rich learning experience for students. This course will
specifically introduce you to educational principles pertaining to learning,
instructional design, and using technology as an educational tool.
Additionally, this course will prepare you to become a lifelong learner and to
build your own professional development plan as a teacher. I hope that this
course will introduce you to different technology resources that will help you
become an inquiry-oriented teacher that is aware of the rich learning
experiences you can provide to future students. The goal of this course is not
for you to become a multimedia software developer. Instead, the goal is for
you to become a teacher who integrates technology into your subject area in an
educationally sound manner. Additionally, it is likely that the skills and
concepts you learn in this course are not currently practiced in many of the
Utah schools. However, as a newly hired teacher you may be very well expected
to be a leading force in the school change efforts in terms of technology
curriculum integration. In order to be prepared for this, you have to be
creative, bold, patient, and resourceful.

**Expectations and Requirements**  
  
> **Attendance**  
>  You are expected and required to attend all class sessions and arrive on
time. This is a lab-based course, and a lot of your work for the class is
expected to take place during class. Additionally, you are required to
participate in group based classroom activities and assignments; therefore,
you are not only responsible to yourself to attend classes, but also to your
classmates.

>

> **Professionalism**  
>  The School of Education is a professional training school. You have made
the choice to enroll in the program to be trained as a teacher. Remember that
you are in-training to become a professional. Consequently, I expect that you
will treat your peers professionally, conduct class presentations
professionally, and submit professional quality writing assignments. You will
be penalized 1 point per day when an assignment is submitted late. Think of it
as if you are attending faculty meetings and submitting reports to your
principals. Finally, I expect that you will all become a part of a community
of teachers that are critical of each others work and feel comfortable in
sharing ideas.

taking initiative in your problem posing and problem solving skills. ****

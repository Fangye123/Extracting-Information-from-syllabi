Human Rights as Moral History
 
Draft Syllabus
Samuel Moyn
 
This European history course provides a basic
undergraduate introduction to the post-1945 regime of humanitarian norms and
law. But, more fundamentally, it aims to take a step back and to place that
system of belief in historical, ideological, and moral context. The emphasis is
on analysis rather than on advocacy. The course is therefore dedicated to four
main topics: 1) long-term origins; 2) short-term origins; 3) evolution through
the present; and 4) moral defenses and ideological criticisms. The first three
topics structure the course and the fourth arises throughout. Thematically, the
course is meant to consider rival candidates for the historical roots of human
rights, with special focus on the religious background; competing proposals to
secure a philosophical justification for the emerging body of norms; and the
moral and/or ideological purposes that the movement may serve. Where did it
come from? Where is it going?

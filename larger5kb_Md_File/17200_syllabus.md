##  SOCIAL THOUGHT IN MODERN AMERICA

This course examines the development of modern American social thought, a
broad category including philosophy, law, literature, art, and political
theory since the Civil War. All of the required readings are from primary
sources; lectures and recommended readings will provide histori-cal and
biographical background and deal with issues not covered in the readings.
Discussion sections will meet once a week and will focus primarily on the
readings. Almost all of the readings are available in the bookstore as well as
on reserve. Readings designated with an asterisk are included in a course pack
that all students in the course must purchase.  
In general, all class meetings will include both lecture and discussion. For
that reason you must do all of the reading on time. In part to help you
achieve that goal, you will be required to write three papers: the first, 5-7
pages long, is due on Monday, October 8; the second, 6-8 pages long, is due on
Monday, November 11; the third, 7-10 pages long, is due on Monday, January 7.
The grades of late papers will be lowered one level for each day they are late
(e.g., a grade of B becomes a B- if one day late, a C+ if two days late,
etc.). These writing assign-ments are intended to encourage you to read
carefully and develop your capacity to think critically and express yourself
clearly.  
The mid-term exam and the first part of the final exam will include a number
of paragraph-long passages taken from the readings and images shown in class
and included on the course web site, which you will be asked to identify and
discuss critically. Part two of the final exam will include two take-home
essay questions. Grades in the course will be determined as follows: mid-term
exam, 10%; first paper, 10%; second paper, 15%; third paper, 20%; final exam,
25%; and participation in class discussions, 20%. As should be apparent, this
is not intended to be an introductory course. A good background in American
history is desirable; a serious commitment to the study of difficult ideas is
essential.  
If you are a student with a documented disability, please see me immediately.

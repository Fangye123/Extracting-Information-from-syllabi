_Buddhist Scriptures: Zen and Pure Land in East Asian Context_

     This course examines the sacred scriptural traditions of East Asian Buddhism with a focus on Chinese and Japanese Zen and Pure Land. This course will closely examine the definition of "scripture" which in East Asian came to mean not only _sutra,_ the teachings of the Buddha, but also commentaries by various masters and other genres. The Taoist text of the _Chuang Tzu_ will also be analyzed as a case study of comparison and contrasts as well as important historical context for the understanding of East Asian Buddhism. This examination will cover a wide range of themes against the backdrop of social and historical developments, including the development of sectarian traditions, cultural and national identity, and gender and race. The seminar format includes lecture, student presentations, and discussion.

**_Requirements_**

1\. _Attendance_ : Required. Students can have one unexcused absence without
penalty. Each class missed thereafter without prior permission will result in
1/2 grade penalty for the course grade.

from the readings, lectures, and course web site.

3\. Medium papers & summaries: There will be two medium-length papers (3-5

reader, due by the Monday before class at 5 p.m. Instructions will be posted
to the course web site.

4\. Presentation: Students will make a presentation on the readings for one of
the section meetings. The presenter should _not_ summarize the reading but
should use the presentation to discuss why the selected ideas/passages in
question are important for understanding the reading and proceed to explain as
well as raise questions about these ideas/passages.

The primary purpose of these presentations is to _launch_ the discussion, not
to demonstrate breadth of knowledge or to lead the discussion. Each presenter
will prepare a handout with 2-3 questions and brief, corresponding quotations
from the readings. More detailed instructions will be provided on the course
web site.

the peer review draft.

Peer review draft for final paper: Drafts will be required for the final
paper. Instructions to follow.

days will be allowed without penalty. Thereafter, each late day will result in
a two-point deduction from the course grade. Weekends are not counted against

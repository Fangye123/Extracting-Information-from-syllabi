Syllabus: English 680W: Seminar in Writing Across the Curriculum Fall 1996

Overview

Here's what I've planned for us this fall. I've chosen two collections,
Bazerman and Russell's _Landmark Essays_ and McLeod and Soven's _Writing
Across the Curriculum: A Guide to Developing Programs_. Between them, they
offer a mix of history, theory, research, pedagogy, and administrative
outlines for Writing Across the Curriculum. I've supplemented these readings
with a collection of additional essays, which is available at Copymat. As
you'll see from the syllabus, my intention is for us to spend the first half
of the semester reading and discussing this material. During the seventh week,
we'll take some time to look at where we've been and where we'd like to go.
We'll do the looking ahead in two ways: you'll each report on the semester
projects you'd like to do, and you'll each suggest a couple of additional
readings for us to consider during the second half of the semester. After we
talk about those additional readings, I'll put together a second course pack,
which we'll use as our text for about five weeks. We'll end the semester with
project reports.  

Some Details

I've set up a reading schedule, typically between 55 and 70 pages per class
session, that I hope will allow us to both read and think about the
assignments--to have time to reread, as necessary, so that people are prepared
to discuss, raise questions, synthesize, and so on. If we find that we don't
have sufficient time for discussion, we'll make some adjustments. One result
of this pace is that I've left out a couple of books which you might have
expected to read, most notably David Russell's _Writing in the Academic
Disciplines, 1870-1990: A Curricular History_. We'll read a shorter historical
piece by Russell instead, and some other discussions of the history of the
movement. Russell's book, along with several others, is on reserve for this
course.  

The major written assignments for the course will be a project proposal, due
October 17th, and the project itself, due no later than noon on December 12th.
We'll discuss and decide upon some other ideas I have for writing to stimulate
our discussions: reading journals, micro-themes (which are a fairly common
writing assignment in WAC and WID programs), in-class journal writing, etc.

Other work includes leading a couple of discussions of assigned readings,
giving a very brief oral presentation about the project you're considering (on
October 1 and 3); and giving project reports during the last several class
periods.

Even More Specific Details: The Project

I assume that through your reading and our discussions, you'll find a
particular issue you want to pursue in more detail. You'll need to be thinking
about find this issue during the first six weeks, so you can float your idea
by the rest of us during the first week in October, then refine it and write a
proposal for your project by October 17. I'll read and respond to your
proposals, and as long as I approve your plan (or approve it following
revisions), you can begin work on it. Part of what your proposal will include
is the format of your project: will it be a publication-length essay (15-25
pages), a review article, a potential conference paper, plans for WAC
workshops of various lengths, something in hypermedia or Web-based? Will it be
an individual project or will you collaborate with others in the class? As
October draws nearer, we'll work out additional details for both the proposals
and the projects.

Some Other Resources

A little further below is a list of books I've put on reserve.

There are also some on-line resources which you might want to be looking at.
The WAC-L discussion list is owned by Gail Hawisher at the University of
Illinois. You can subscribe to it by sending the following message to
listserv@Postoffice.cso.uiuc.edu: Subscribe WAC-L your name. Larry Beason at
Eastern Washington University maintains a WAC homepage on the Web at
http://ewu66649.ewu.edu/WAC.html. The link to the Northern Illinois University
page, maintained by Dale Sullivan, is a pretty good one.

One final resource (though not the resource of last resort, I'd hope): I'll be
holding office hours on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons after class and on
Wednesday afternoons between 1 and 3. I'll be available at other times by
appointment. My office is in 302; the phone number is 494-3730. My email
address is iweiser@purdue.edu.

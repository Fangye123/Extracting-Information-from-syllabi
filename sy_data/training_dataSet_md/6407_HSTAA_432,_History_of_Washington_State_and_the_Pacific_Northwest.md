COURSE OVERVIEW:  
  
![](images/syllabus/head2.gif)

Although these lessons are available to anyone interested in them, they have
been written primarily for undergraduates&#0151both on campus and enrolled in
Distance Learning&#0151at the University of Washington in HSTAA 432, History
of Washington State and the Pacific Northwest. As such, the lessons are not
intended to serve as a comprehensive overview of regional or state history;
rather, they are quite explicitly intended to be used in conjunction with
other sources of information. Some students using the lessons will also be
reading Carlos Arnaldo Schwantes, _The Pacific Northwest: An Interperetive
History_ , rev. ed. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1996), a textbook
overview of regional history, so the lessons have been developed so as not to
overlap too much with Schwantes. They are more thematic and conceptual than
the textbook, and are meant to delve deeper into certain areas while glossing
over other topics covered by Schwantes. Reflecting their origins as lectures
in courses taught in Seattle for students who come primarily from the Puget
Sound basin, the lessons also focus more on western Washington than on other
parts of the region. Finally, the lessons reflect my own personal research
interests and teaching strategies.

I welcome comments and suggestions for additions and revisions.

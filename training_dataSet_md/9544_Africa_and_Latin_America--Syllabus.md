**PRELIMINARY _INTERACTIVE_ COURSE SYLLABUS**

**This is an Honors course.   As such, I will encourage more reflection and
discussion than might normally be the case in a class of this kind, and less
memorization, although, obviously, mastery of the background material is
desirable and even necessary to make literate arguments.  Exams, however, will
mostly be open-ended essays (with some identification questions), and
attendance, periodic short quizzes and (e-mailed) essays and discussion will
be emphasized. Moreover, this e-syllabus is interactive, and hence will change
over the course of the semester, although I will not change the grading
process, nor will there be an increase in expectations (other than, of course,
the addition of some readings in sections where "Readings--To Be Determined"
is listed.**

 **It is important to add that, as Dean of Arts and Sciences, unexpected
scheduling may interfere occasionally with my ability to meet with the class.
Every effort will be made to provide alternative classroom opportunities.**  


The texts for the course are:

            Paul Bohannan and Philip Curtin, _Africa and Africans_ , Fourth Edition (Prospect Heights, Illinois: Waveland Press, 1995).

            Thomas E. Skidmore and Peter H. Smith, _Modern Latin America_ , Fifth Edition (New York: Oxford University Press, 2001).

            Helen Winternitz, _East along the Equator_ , (New York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 1985).

            Chinua Achebe, _Things Fall Apart_ (New York: Anchor Books, 1995).

            Gabriel Garcia Marquez, _One Hundred Years of Solitude_ , Trans. Gregory Rabassa (New York: Harper-Collins, 1998).

**Copies of the texts are available in the University Bookstore.   In
addition, several articles, to be announced in class, will be available in the
Library on reserve.**

     I would like to use the first several class days to provide a general overview of this huge subject [these huge subject ** _s_** , actually], and to put together a more complete syllabus--especially as regards class exercises--through consultation with the class.  In other words, I would like to begin building this course with your participation.  My initial suggestion is that class time be divided into lectures and discussions involving salient political, cultural, sociological and historical themes of Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America, as well as more focused discussions of selected Sub-Saharan African and Latin American countries.  Short impressionistic essays\--e-mailed to me for inclusion on the web (by identification codes, rather than names) and periodic short (announced in advance) quizzes will also be utilized.  I have selected several broad (overview) topics, and several countries in each region that I believe will give special insights into the wider realities.  Obviously, these are huge and very diverse regions, and scrutiny of these very general topics and countries will provide only a partial glimpse of the wider, regional reality.  The topics and countries are: 

                  **Sub-Saharan Africa--**   
**                                 African Society--A Brief Overview**  
**                                 African History--A Brief Overview**  
**                                 Democratic Republic of the Congo**  
**                                 Tanzania**  
**                                 Republic of South Africa**

**                Latin America--**  
**                                 Latin American Society--A Brief Overview**  
**                                 Latin American--A Brief Overview**  
**                            Argentina**  
**                            Brazil**  
**                            Mexico**

Emphasis will be placed upon your own efforts to immerse yourselves in primary
cultural/news contacts.  An especially available source of such contacts is
the Worldwide Web.  A number of newspaper and other news sources are readily
available, including, for Sub-Saharan Africa, http://allafrica.com/ and, for
Latin America, http://dir.yahoo.com/Regional/Regions/Latin_America/ . Both of
these sites link to a number of other possibilities.  I will provide you with
a number of other possible sites as the semester progresses.

You will be encouraged to do individual reading as part of the course
curriculum: exams will feature "open-ended" questions, and the paper, to be
written in stages (if the class is agreeable) will require a credible
bibliography.  We will jointly establish a reading list, which I will post on
the web.

**As per requests in class, for a web site that has up-to-date info on the
countries of the world, clickhere . I also recommend the _World Almanac_ for a
brief synopsis of the history of each of the African and Latin American
countries--if you are looking to jog your memory on a major event..   Of
course, we will be delving far deeper into this subject with complete
sources.**  


**Course grades will be determined according to the following formula:**

     15%  **Each** of the two Midterm Examinations   (February 16 and March 30)   
     20%  Final Examination-- **comprehensive, open-ended essays** , some identification (May 2, 12:00-1:50 PM)   
     35%  Class Participation (including quizzes, short essays and participatory exercises)   
     15%  Research Paper 

**_All of the above course components must be completed._**

For students enrolled at the 292-level, a 5-7 page term paper will be
required.  Students enrolled at the 492-level will be required to produce a
8-10 page paper.  However, you may write a more extensive one for  up to 10%
bonus credit (depending upon its grade).  Your plan to do this, however, must
be approved by February 9 after consultation with me.  At any rate, you will
be required in both cases to select a specific and relevant topic to be chosen
in consultation  with me by March 9.  These papers will be staged writing
assignments, and I will be consulting with you on each of the stages.  You
should find this to be an interesting process.  


  * As noted, paper topics must be selected in consultation with me by March 9.
  * The first stage, including the bulk of bibliographic sources, copies of materials likely to be cited, and the introductory section, will be due by April 6th.
  * The final drafts will be due no later than April 25th.   Late papers will not be accepted.  The final draft must be printed in a standard academic style.

If you have a documented disability and wish to discuss academic
accommodations, please make an appointment with me as soon as possible.

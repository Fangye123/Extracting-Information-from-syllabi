**Textbooks and Other Course Materials**

**Required:**

|

_Structured Computer Organization_ by Andrew Tanenbaum, 4th ed.

_Programmers Reference Manual_ by Motorola  
  
---|---  
  
**Highly Recommended:**

|

_Course Notes_ by the Staff  
  
Copies of all three of these items are on reserve in the Science Center
Library.

* * *

**Syllabus**

> Here's a coarse outline of material to be covered in the course: we'll start
with a quick zip through the first two chapters of Tanenbaum, learning about
the multi-layered approach to machine organization, along with what you might
find in a typical computer system. Then, we'll spend three weeks on Chapter 3,
discussing Boolean logic and the technology associated with it. After that, we
will move on to Chapter 4, which addresses the microcode layer between
hardware and software. The midterm will cover all aforementioned material. We
will then shift gears into software and Assembly Language programming,
concurrently covering Chapter 5 of Tanenbaum and the Programmer's Reference
Manual for the remainder of the semester. At the end, we will spend one
lecture on Chapter 6 of Tanenbaum learning about operating systems.

* * *

**Online Resources**

> There is a folder on FirstClass called CS240-F01 for this course. All class
materials and handouts, including the assignments and solutions, will be in
this folder. (An exception are the transparencies used in class - these can be
purchased at the bookstore as the Course Notes. Also, portions of some
solutions may be handwritten. In this case the copies of the solutions can be
picked up from us in our offices during office hours.) You can use the folder
to post questions that you have about the lectures and assignments. I will
read the folder regularly; however, if you see a student's question to which
you know the answer, please go ahead and post the answer.

**Tutoring**

###

**Drop-in:**





|

Weekly drop-in hours will be held by the CS240 tutor, Audrey Lee, day and time
to be announced.

**Personal:**





|

Individual tutors (through the Learning and Teaching Center) are available to
students who find themselves in need of additional help. Please see us if you
would like to explore this option, and we will help you to determine whether
you need a tutor, and if so, help you to arrange a tutor through LTC.  
  
* * *

**Course Requirements**

> * This is a 1.25 credit course. The main components are:

> * Laboratory: Three hours in [ laboratory](lab/cs240_lab.html) weekly,
including a lab report (completed during the lab session). Also, weekly
laboratory assignments to be completed outside lab hours.  
>

> * Homework/Programming Assignments: There will be nine homeworks or small
programming assignments during the semester (see [schedule](syllabus.html) for
due dates).  
>

> * Programming Project: There will be a large programming project due at the
end of the semester (see [schedule](syllabus.html) for exact due date).  
>

> * Midterm/Final: The midterm will be on **Friday, October 26**. If special
circumstances prevent you from taking the midterm during the scheduled time
you must contact us as soon as possible to discuss your situation. The final
exam will be taken during finals' week. Both exams are open book and notes.  
>

> * Readings: The book sections you should read for the each lecture are
provided in the [schedule.](syllabus.html)

Policies**

> **Collaboration Policy**

>

> Please note that each course in the Computer Science Department has its own
collaboration policy. Indeed, even the collaboration policies for courses
taught by the same faculty member may significantly differ. Do not assume
anything about the collaboration policy for this course. Instead, be careful
to understand the policy outlined below, and see me if you have any questions.

>

> It is never acceptable to present someone else's work as if it were your
own. Unless stated otherwise, I will assume that all work you hand in is yours
and yours alone. Collaboration on class assignments is acceptable but each
student must submit her own individual assignments, indicating clearly any
other students with whom she works. If you get help from us or a TA that
constitutes a significant part of the assignment, you should acknowledge that,
too. If you are not sure, err on the side of caution.

>

> Copying other people's code or work is a serious violation and will be
regarded as a disciplinary matter.

>

> In general, it is acceptable to talk about your code and problem set
solutions using natural languages, but not acceptable to use any formal
language, and especially not assembly language. In other words, you should not
be looking at other people's code or problem set solutions or showing them
yours.

>

> When working on homework problems, it is perfectly reasonable to consult
public literature (books, articles, etc.) for hints, techniques, and even
solutions. However, you must reference any sources that contribute to your
solution. Assignments, exams, solutions and notebooks from previous terms of
CS240 are **not** considered to be part of the "public" literature - not every
student has access to such materials. You must refrain from looking at _any
materials_ from previous terms of CS240. **It is my policy that consulting any
materials from previous terms constitutes a violation of the honor code.**

>

> #### **Late Policy**

>

> LATE ASSIGNMENTS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR CREDIT. If you wish to hand in an
overdue assignment, we will acknowledge your effort and provide feedback, but
you will not receive a grade. When determining your final grade, the lowest
assignment score will be dropped. Late assignments due to a medical or
personal emergency will be accepted only with a supporting note from a medical
person or Class Dean. Class extensions on an assignment will be announced in
class and on the FirstClass conference, so please check it regularly! Formal
solutions will be distributed soon after the due date.

>

> #### **Students with Disabilities**

>

> I strongly encourage students with disabilities to visit me soon to discuss
appropriate accommodations that might be helpful to them.

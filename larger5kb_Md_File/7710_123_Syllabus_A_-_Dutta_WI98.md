### General Information

**ENROLLMENT:** There are twenty-five work stations in a general chemistry
[laboratory room](../maps/clabmap.htm) which limits the size of a lab section.
Locker assignments are given at the first laboratory period. If a student
cannot attend the first lab or gets into a section after the lab has met, the
student should immediately go to [100 Celeste](../maps/c100map.htm) to get a
locker card for that section. During the first week of the quarter, enrollment
is determined by the [registrar](http://www.ureg.ohio-
state.edu/ourweb/online.html) and all adds or changes are done through BRUTUS
as [space
permits](http://128.146.223.158/scripts/ehtcgi.exe?Student.NewCA+ViewCse).
After the first week, students should go to 100 Celeste to add or change a
section if space allows. Since a student is not officially enrolled in a
chemistry course until they have a locker assignment, failure to attend the
first laboratory class may result in disenrollment.

**STUDENT RESPONSIBILITY:** Each student receives this information about
Chemistry 123 in the first lecture section. It is your responsibility to read
this material and be familiar with course content, course procedures, and
grading. You are also responsible for any announcements concerning course
procedures which are made in class, whether you are present or not! (If you
are absent, you are expected to get notes, announcements, etc. from another
student in the class.)

**HOMEWORK:** Assignments will be given during lecture. Homework will not be
graded; however, doing assigned problems is often the best way to determine
how well you understand the material. SOLUTIONS WILL BE POSTED IN THE HOMEWORK
CASE ON THE SECOND FLOOR OF CELESTE LAB.

**ADDITIONAL HELP:**

  1. Extra copies of course handouts are available in the General Chemistry Office, [100 Celeste Lab](../maps/c100map.htm).

  2. You are strongly encouraged to make use of the [Learning Resource Center (160 CE)](../maps/c100map.htm) frequently. Teaching assistants hold [Office Hours](aidtime.htm) there and will help with lab questions, homework, and preparation for quizzes and exams.

  3. Lab Supervisor - [Dr. Tatz](http://amichemii.mps.ohio-state.edu) ([144 Celeste](../maps/c144map.htm), 292-8096, [email](mailto:Tatz.1@osu.edu)) will help you in problems concerning lab such as attendance, completion of labs, and grading of reports.

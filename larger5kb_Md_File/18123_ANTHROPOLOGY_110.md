### GOALS OF THIS COURSE

Archaeology and archaeologists are portrayed in the mass media as scientists,
treasure hunters, adventures, harmless eccentrics, or murderers. Newspaper and
magazine articles describe the latest scientific discoveries by
archaeologists. Movies, such as the Indiana Jones series, portray the
archaeologist as adventurers pursuing treasures and fame. Mystery novels by
Tony Hillerman, Agatha Christy, and others present tales of murder and
intrigue on archaeological digs in exotic settings. Despite the high level of
media attention that archaeology receives, seldom do we encounter accurate
presentations of what archaeologists are attempting to accomplish and how
archaeology is done. In this course students will learn about the goals and
methods of contemporary archaeology. How do we do archaeology and what are we
trying to achieve.

At the completion of this course, students should be able to:  
  

  * Describe the various contemporary approaches to archaeology 
  * Identify the major periods of historical development of archaeology 
  * Explain how archaeological research designs are structured 
  * Explain how archaeologists gather data for their research 
  * Explain how archaeologists determine the date of sites and reconstruct the culture history of an area 
  * Explain how archaeologists link archaeological data with specific patterns of human behavior 
  * Describe how archaeologists reconstruct past lifeways (subsistence and technology) and past environments 
  * Explain how archaeologists reconstruct past social, political, and economic institutions 
  * Explain how archaeologists reconstruct past ideology and religion (cognitive archaeology) 
  * Explain how archaeologists investigate the lifeways of prehistoric hunter gatherers 
  * Explain how archaeologists investigate long-term culture change 
  * Explain the goals of historical archaeology and how it is conducted 
  * Describe the Federal laws that govern cultural resource management 
  * Describe some of the problems that have developed between archaeologists and Native Americans. 
  * Describe some the ways that archaeologists and Native Americans can work together in a mutually beneficial manner. 
  * Describe the ethical rules that govern contemporary archaeology 
  * Describe how archaeology can be applied to contemporary problems 

### READINGS

### PARTICIPATION

Ten percent (10%) of your grade will be based on class participation,
including class attendance and participation in discussion. Prior to each
class a study guide with questions for discussion will be handed out. To get
the most out of our discussoin, we must be prepared. That means you are
responsible for having read the class assignments and for having thought
through the questoins given out ahead of time. In order to create a good
climate for everyone to participate, please follow these discussion
guidelines:  
  

  * Be ready to share and explain your opinions. Feel free to disagree with others, but be specific in your own assertions and back them up with evidence. 
  * Listen carefully and respond to other members of the group. Be willing to change your mind when someone demonstrates an error in your logic or use of facts. 
  * Do not hesitate to ask for clarification of any point or term that you do not understand. 
  * Make your point succinctly, avoid repetition, and stick to the subject. 

### PAPER

Students will write one paper (a minimum of 5 pages, typed, double-spaced) on
one of the four case studies. In their papers students will explain what the
goals of the archaeologist who conducted the case study were and how he
attempted to achieve them. Students will also give a class presentation about
their evaluations of the results of their chosen case studies. This paper
counts as 15% of your grade.

### CD-ROM ASSIGNMENT

Students will write one paper (a minimum of 5 pages, typed, double-spaced) on
the CD-ROM assignment. The paper will count for 15% of your grade.

### EXAMS

There will be a midterm and a final exam, each of which will count for thirty
percent (30%) of your grade.

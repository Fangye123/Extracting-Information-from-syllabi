We  spent the first semester mastering the basics, i.e., the necessary  mathematical tools, the problems that led to the development of quantum  mechanics, and the rudiments of Dirac notation using the 1-D paradigm of a  bead-on-a-wire (where V=0).  In this second semester we will broaden our  understanding by considering systems with potentials in 3-D spatial  coordinates.  We will investigate new operators such as angular momentum,  spin, and raising and lowering operators.  Using the mathematical formalism  of linear algebra, we will solve eigenvalue problems.  We will finish with  basic statistical mechanics, a brief description of nuclear physics and  particle physics in the context of the four fundamental forces of nature.   For the quantum mechanics part of the course we will continue to use  A  Primer of Quantum Mechanics by M.  Chester.  Dr Chester, who owns the copyright,  has given us permission to  reproduce as many copies as there are students in the class.  For the rest of  the material we will use Eisberg & Resnick from last semester.               requirements:   PHYS 4111, PHYS 4112 (or concurrent), and PHYS 4411 with  course grades no lower than C in any  of the above.               grading:   Your performance will be judged on the following: 3 midterms @ 15% each                    45  % homework                                          10% final exam                                          45%   Your final grade in the course will be based on the total  number of points you achieve, weighted as indicated above, such that: 87.5 - 100.0 %  A 75.0 - 87.4 %  B 62.5 - 74.9 %  C 50.0 - 62.4 %  D 0 - 49.0 %  F At any time if you  wish to know your current grade, please come see me.             expectations:   You are expected to attend all lectures.  Absences in  excess of 20% can result in a failing grade, as outlined in the 1998-1999 VSU Undergraduate Bulletin.  Review sessions are optional.     Homework will be collected once or twice a week and full  solution sets will be provided.  Only one or two problems will be graded for  each homework set, chosen at random.  If you do not do the problems  consistently, I guarantee that you will not be able to pass the exams.  The  midterms and the final exam will consist of problems similar but not  identical to the homework.  Exams in physics courses are not designed to test  whether you have memorized a problem-solving method in a rote manner.   Physics exams test your ability to apply the concepts that you have mastered  in the homework to new situations.  Bear this in mind.               general policies:   No late homework  will be accepted.     There will be no make-up exams for midterms.  If you miss an exam (i.e., you are absent  without making arrangements with me beforehand) you will receive a zero for that midterm exam.   My approval for an absence depends on your having a legitimate  reason.  (Note:  a doctor's appointment is not a legitimate reason to miss an exam).   As for all physics courses, the final exam will be comprehensive.  No one will be exempt from taking the final  exam for any reason.   For the midterms and final exam, you may use the CRC  Mathematical Tables.     Cheating is absolutely unacceptable. The first offense will result in a  failing grade in this course.                    Students requiring  accommodations because of a documented disability should discuss this need with me at the beginning  of the semester, and I will do everything possible to make reasonable  adjustments.  Disabled students who are not registered with the Special  Services Program should contact the Special Services Office in Nevins Hall,  room NH 1115 or call them at 245-2498.               tips for success:   I encourage you to work together.  That is, after trying a  homework set on your own, get together with classmates to discuss any hard  spots.  As a student, I found it very helpful to copy over lecture notes,  filling in any steps that were left out in class.  For me, it was a good way  to find out what I did not understand.  But above all else,        DO THE HOMEWORK!!        SCHEDULE OF LECTURES      Week #   Day   Topics   Reading                                         1   M        7 Jan   Introduction, 4411 Final Exam Review                               W        9   Brief Review of Chp 3   Chp 3                       2   M        14   Harmonic Oscillator in x-space                               W        16   Particle in a Box   Chp 4                       3   M        21   MLK HOLIDAY   Chp                            W        23   Lowering and Raising Operators   Chp 4                       4   M        28   Multi-dimensions and Angular Momentum   Chp 5                           W        30   Vector Operators   Chp 5                       5   M        4  Feb    and its  Eigenvalues — Spherical Harmonics   Chp 5                           W        6   FIRST MIDTERM EXAM                           6   M        11   Magnetic Moment Spectra   Chp 6                           W        13   Spin and the electron   Chp 6                       7   M        18   Review of Matrix Manipulation   Chp 6                           W        20   Matrices and the Eigenvalue Problem   Chp 6                       8   M        25   Photoelectric Effect Revisited   Chp 7                                             W        27     Time-dependent Schrodinger Equation   Chp 7                       9   M        4  Mar   Interaction Hamiltonian   Chp 7                           W        6   Two Bound Particles   Chp 8                       10   M        11   SECOND MIDTERM EXAM                               W        13   Periodic Boundary Conditions   Chp 8                       11   M        18   Eigenstates of  Energy-Compatible Operators   Chp 8                           W        20   Electrostatic Field and the Hydrogen Atom   Chp 8                       12   M        25   SPRING BREAK    Chp 9                           W        27   SPRING BREAK    Chp 9                       13   M        1  Apr   Bosons and Fermions — Indistinguishability   Chp 9                           W        3   Spin and Total Angular Momentum    Chp 10                       14   M        8   Perturbation Theory & the WKB Approximation                                W        10   THIRD MIDTERM EXAM                           15   M        15

## Syllabus for  
MAT 201--Calculus I  
Spring 1999

I. COURSE DESCRIPTION  
  

This course is a study of the introductory concepts of single variable
calculus and is designed for students in engineering, economics, life science,
mathematics, and physical science seeking basic skills and knowledge in those
disciplines. The techniques of the calculus, which is often recognized as one
of the major intellectual achievements of the human race, were invented out of
a necessity to solve some of the problems of physics dealing with the
universal law of gravitation and planetary motion. Calculus has evolved into a
branch of mathematics that now furnishes a convenient tool for solving not
only many problems of physics but also many of the problems of the other
sciences. It is even today influencing the other sciences and being influenced
by them. Following a brief review of algebra and trigonometry, an intuitive
study of the limit concept is made. Then the derivative is introduced followed
by a study of techniques of differentiation. The properties of the
transcendental exponential and logarithmic functions as well as the
application of the derivative to these functions are then studied. A study of
vectors and parametric equations is then made followed by applications of the
derivative. Finally, integration is introduced and is related to the existence
of antiderivatives by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. There will be a
computer laboratory component to this course in which the students will
explore calculus through the use of the computer.  
  

II. COURSE GOALS  
  

The course is designed to introduce the student to the differential calculus
of functions of a single variable. This course and the following two calculus
courses provide a thorough study of the foundations of calculus. Also, the
students will use the computer to explore the concepts of calculus and to find
solutions to the more difficult problems.

E. Unit 5: Projects. The student is expected to submit two projects during the
semester. Each chapter concludes with a related project. Also, the instructor
has some related

projects. The projects are longer, multiple-part problems. They either extend
the concepts in the chapter or introduce related topics that did not merit
inclusion in the text. They nevertheless are interesting. Most of the projects
require use of a calculator or a computer. Students may work on an assigned
project in small groups of no more than four (individual work is permitted if
preferred). These project reports must be written up like a term paper and
handed in at the appointed time (see the assignment schedule in this
syllabus). More

details will follow in a few weeks.

C. Other Information  
  

1\. "Consistent with Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the
Americans With Disabilities Act, ORU ensures that no **"qualified
individual"** will be denied reasonable accommodation in the form of
modification of policies, practices and/or procedures." Students with
disabilities who wish to access services should contact their professor(s) and
the Office of Disability Services at Ext. 7355 to initiate the process.

2\. Most of your previous mathematics class time has probably been spent
listening to an instructor lecture to you about the material while you take
notes. This is a very passive approach, one which I would like to change in
this course. Rather than lecture to you all of the time, I'd prefer to spend
some class time discussing the material with you. You'll be surprised how much
clearer things become once you say them out loud. In order for this to work,
you must prepare for each class by reading the book prior to class. Remember,
CALCULUS IS NOT A SPECTATOR SPORT!!!

3\. There are three types of activities--reading, text exercises, and computer
laboratory. A daily assignment schedule is included in this syllabus. Each
section of the text is to be read prior to the class discussion of that
section. We will go over assignments on the day on which they are due.
Exercises and problems must be turned in at the end of the class period on the
date they are due in order to receive credit (see GRADING below). You may be
asked to put some problems or exercises on the board in class.

4\. Reading mathematics is very different from reading a novel. Every word and
equation is important, and you should consider each one carefully before going
on. Keep a pencil and paper handy as you read so that you can fill in details
that may not be written down explicitly. Be sure to try the exercises in the
book. The answers are in the back of the book. Be ready to ask questions in
class about the problems in class. Do not be afraid to ask; surely, there are
others with the same question.

5\. Some exercises are routine and mechanical, much like the homework you are
accustomed to having in mathematics courses. Other exercises require more
thought, and you may find them frustrating at the beginning. We will talk
about some problem-solving strategies, but the best way to learn to solve
problems is to persevere. You will eventually learn what questions to ask
yourself, how to try simple cases, and how to generalize. Be patient--the
effort is worth it. Problem solving is what mathematics is all about.

6\. The computer laboratories are designed so that students can explore the
concepts which are covered in the text. The first two laboratories are
designed to introduce you to the computer algebra system Maple. Afterwards, I
will take a few minutes at the beginning of the lab period to introduce the
laboratory exercise. Then you will spend the rest of the time investigating
calculus with Maple by going through the lab in the supplementary text
_Calculus the Maple Way_.

7\. There will be four exams as scheduled (see the daily assignment schedule)
as well as a final exam. Each exam will be like the exercises; the majority
will be like the problems that were assigned for homework, possibly including
some variations of those. From time to time throughout the semester, there may
be a quiz on the material covered recently in class. These quizzes may or may
not be announced in advance.

8\. You are encouraged to ask for help whenever you do not understand
something or cannot solve a problem. I will try to be available as much as
possible. If my office hours are inconvenient, you may call for help or make
an appointment.

Students and faculty in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science
ascribe to all laws addressing the ethical use of others' material, whether it
be in the form of print, video, multimedia, or computer software.  
  

VI. ATTENDANCE POLICY

A. Attendance at each class or laboratory is mandatory at Oral Roberts
University.

B. Double cuts will be assessed for absences immediately preceding or
following holidays or breaks.

C. In keeping with both the spirit and the letter of the ORU Honor Code, the
Mathematics/ Computer Science Department expects your attendance at each class
period. A LOSS OF POINTS MAY OCCUR AS A RESULT OF ABSENCES FROM CLASS.

D. An administratively excused absence (pre-approved by the Academic Dean)
allows the assignment to be made up without penalty; however, the student must
take the responsibility for furnishing the excuse to the instructor, who will
ascertain when the makeup work is expected.

E. All other absences, regardless of reason, are not excused. Some events,
beyond your own control, can occur which prevent your attendance. The
instructor has the right to evaluate such cases on an individual basis to
ascertain if a penalty will be assessed. It remains the responsibility of the
student to check with the instructor immediately upon return to class to
determine the consequences of said absence.

F. In cases where an exam is missed and must be administered later, a late-
exam fee will be assessed.

G. It is the right of the instructor to devise methods to achieve good
attendance and punctuality. These methods may include pop quizzes that cannot
be made up, bonus points for perfect attendance, loss of points for any
absences, or other procedures to encourage attendance.

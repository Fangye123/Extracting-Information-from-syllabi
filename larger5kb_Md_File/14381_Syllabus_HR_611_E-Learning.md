---|---|---  
For on-site courses, the attendance policy of Western Carolina University's
Graduate School is stated in the [_Graduate
Catalog_](http://www.wcu.edu/UnivCatalog/GCatalog/) as follows: _"Graduate
students are expected to attend all class meetings. Specific attendance
regulations are announced by the instructor."_ Specific attendance regulations
pertaining to HR 611 E-Learning on-site require students to have no more than
two absences and two tardiness. More than two absences may result in a
recommendation of the instructor to withdraw from the class, a lowering of the
final grade by 15% for each class missed, or a grade of Incomplete. On-line
students are required to attend two Saturday meetings. Requirements for
removing a grade of Incomplete will be determined on a student-by-student
basis. More than two tardiness' will result in a 3% reduction in a student's
grade. Please refer to your [Graduate Student
Handbook](http://www.wcu.edu/graduate/handbook.html) for information regarding
the policies of the Graduate School. |  Passing off another person's ideas
and/or words as your own creative work is plagiarism. The APA style manual
shows how to properly reference the works of others. Acts of plagiarism at
Western Carolina University are considered serious academic infractions and
can result in a failing grade or removal from a program. | Late work is
subject to a 10% reduction in points per week.  
All written assignments must be typed according to APA style and submitted
electronically in the specified format. Specific content, form, and neatness
criteria are used to evaluate all written assignments.

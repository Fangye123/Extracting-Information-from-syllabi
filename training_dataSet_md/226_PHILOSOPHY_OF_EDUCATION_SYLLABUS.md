Incompletes Policy:

Only students who are receiving a grade of C or better (=70 points minimum)
are eligible for an incomplete at the time they request it. This means they
should have accumulated at least 70 points even to be considered for an
Incomplete (except in extenuating circumstances, such as, hospitalization, or
the like, where the student has no control over the situation). Furthermore,
students should have had an excellent attendance record, and more importantly,
a valid reason of why they should be offered an incomplete, before one can be
assigned. The instructor does not consider the need to read over the required
reading assignments, or more time to complete any of the other class
requirements, as valid reasons.

Recommendation Letters Policy:

As a general rule, recommendation letters will not be completed by the
instructor before the student has completed all requirements for the course,
and has been assigned a final grade.

Attendance Policy:

For each hour a student has been absent, he/she loses 1 point. To have an
absence excused, a student must have a legitimate excuse, including a written
statement from a health professional, qualified employer, and the like.
Students who walk in class after attendance has been taken, will be marked
"tardy." Three tardy marks are equivalent to 1 absence point. Students who are
tardy should notify the instructor at the end of the class period of their
presence, so that they will not be marked absent.

Students should attend class for at least 30 minutes per 50 minutes of class
time to be marked as either tardy or present. Otherwise, they will be marked
"absent." For example, students who leave right after attendance is taken will
be marked absent.

Students with more than 6 hourly absences from class may be dropped from the
course by the instructor. See Official Academic Regulations regarding Class
Attendance in the Undergraduate Catalogue.

Mid-term Make Up Policy

Only students with written medical or job-related excuses may take the mid-
term exam at a date other than the one announced in class. All students with
such written excuses taking the mid-term examination at another date must: (a)
show proof of such written excuses before being allowed to take the mid-term
examination; and (b) take the mid-term examination on the same date and at the
same time, usually 1 week after the regular exam date. Date of the mid-term
make-up exam will be announced by the instructor in class.

Rules Regarding Classroom Decorum

1\. No eating in the classroom.

2\. No children are allowed to attend. Please find alternative child care
facilities for your child(ren).

3\. Noone who is not officially registered is allowed to attend.

4\. No form of disruptive behavior will be tolerated.

Students who break the above rules may be asked to leave the classroom.

**History 470: Asia and America**

  

This course examines the history of interaction between America and Asia from
the 19th century to the present featuring case studies on China, Japan, Korea,
and Vietnam. Readings and discussions will introduce students to a variety of
perspectives from social and cultural history, Asian-American studies, and
foreign relations.

There are three thematic sections in this course:

Part 1: "Asian Homelands" will address the cultural, political and economic
issues at work in 19th and 20th century China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam as
well as the initial impulses for emigration.

Part 2: "American Interests in Asia" will examine American foreign policy,
ideas of cultural superiority, and ideological goals in Asia since the 19th
century: imperialism; missionaries and merchants; the history of  America's
wars in Asia.

Part 3: "The Asian-American Experience" chronicles the arrival of Asian
immigrant groups in America and their pursuit of the "American dream," the
establishment of Asian immigrant enclaves; immigration policies and
legislation; racial prejudice and discrimination; and identity.

**I) Required Readings:**

  * J. Hagadorn,  Charlie Chan Is Dead: An Anthology of Contemporary Asian American Fiction
  * C. Heinz, Asian Cultural Traditions
  * R. Takaki, Strangers From a Different Shore: a History of AsianAmericans

**Other readings will be on "reserve" at Zulauf Hall (722) and also through
the Internet. Be sure to check the seminar schedule for locations.**

**II) Student Responsibilities:** All students must fully and actively
participate in class discussions. In addition, all students must complete two
(2) "team" presentations and write an analytical essay of  "Homeland Security
and Asian Americans".

A) Class Discussions: All students must be prepared to discuss the assigned
readings and materials each class session. Consistent preparation and full
participation is expected . Students must take careful and detailed notes on
assigned readings and bring "reading notes" to each class session; notes will
be collected periodically without warning.

B) Team Presentations: Each student will be assigned to a "team" of 2-3
members for two (2) assignments:

1\. Each team must present the key issues and perspectives of all assigned
materials in one (1)class session during the semester. Each member of team
must show full preparation and knowledge. Team members must work together in
this assignment. They must divide the workload and presentation equally. The
instructor will evaluate the presentation for breadth of coverage, analysis,
and presentation style. Each team member must submit comprehensive "reading
notes" at the time of presentation. Notes must be typed and well organized.
Each member of  the team will receive an individual grade. The instructor will
assign  
each team a class session for the presentation.

2\. The same team members must also prepare a presentation on some aspect of
Asian-American "fusion": the blending of cultures in literature, art, music,
film/TV, fashion, food, etc. Teams are encouraged to be creative. Teams will
consult with the instructor throughout the semester.  Each member of the team
must prepare individual comprehensive outlines of his/her part of the topic
and an annotated bibliography and submit these material s at the time of
scheduled oral presentation. Team presentations on Asian-American "fusion"
will take place the last week of the semester.

C) Essay: "Homeland Security and Asian Americans"

There have been a number of occasions in modern American history when Asian-
American citizens or Asian immigrants with permanent residency status have
been unjustly singled out due to race and/or ethnicity.  Students will choose
a historical event involving Asian-Americans and analyze the issue of
racial/ethnic "profiling" used to justify actions taken against an individual
or group. Essays must make use of both primary source documents and assigned
materials from this seminar.  Footnotes and bibliography required. Essays must
be typed.  Suggested length: 10 pages (double spaced) .  
**Due: April 4, 2002 in class.**  


**III) Identification and Written Assignments**. **Please Note: The instructor
asks that a student put only the last four digits of his/her social security
number on the front of a written assignment.   Please print your full name on
the back page of the assignment.**

**IV) Late Work Policy:** All work must be handed in on time during the class
session. Late assignments will be penalized one full letter grade for each day
late starting from the end of the class session.  
No make-ups, extensions, or incompletes except with prior approval of the
instructor and then only as a result of extraordinary circumstances.   Missing
assignments will be recorded as zeros ( "0").

**V) Attendance:** Attendance will be taken each class session. Students who
more than 10 minutes late for a class session will be marked "absent" for the
day.

A) Excused Absences: Students may be excused from class without penalty under
the following circumstances: documented personal illness; documented personal
emergency; documented family emergency; death in the family. It is the
student's responsibility to notify the instructor at the time of illness or
emergency. DO NOT WAIT UNTIL YOU RETURN TO CAMPUS.

B) Unexcused Absences: Unexcused absences will receive a daily grade of  "0"
(zero) , which will affect each student's discussion grade.

**VI) Grading Percentages:**

  * Discussion: 25%
  * Team Presentations (2):
  * -Class Session: 25%
  * -"Asian Am. Fusion": 25%
  * Essay: "Homeland Security and Asian-Americans": 25%

assignment due date, please inform the instructor within the first week of the
semester and provide the dates and times of conflict.

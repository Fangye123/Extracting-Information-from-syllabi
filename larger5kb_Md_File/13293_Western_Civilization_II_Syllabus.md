**      History 102: Western Civilization** **Syllabus**  
---|---  
  
* * *

  


**Required Reading:**  
**Text: Perry, et al., _Western Civilization: Ideas, Politics & Society_**  
**          Primary Readings**

**  Description: History 102 is a study of the development of western
institutions, ideas and cultures from about 1500 to the present.**

**  Tests: There will be two in-class tests and a three-hour comprehensive
final exam. All tests and the final will include objective (e.g., multiple
choice, fill in the blank, etc.) and subjective (essay, identification)
components. In addition to the scheduled tests, there will also be any number
of short answer quizzes on the reading assignments. The quizzes are designed
to familiarize the student with the types of objective questions which will
appear on the major tests.**

**  Writing: You will also write two short essays on the primary readings. The
first paper (3-5 pp., typed, double spaced) will be an analysis of one of the
primary readings. The second paper will be an analysis of _two or more of the
primary readings_. Each essay should not merely recount the narrative of the
reading selection but should place the reading in the context of what you
learn in class and your text about western civilization. In other words, how
does this reading add to your knowledge of western civ? If you were trying to
explain the history of western civilization, would you use this selection? Why
or why not?**

**  For the first assignment, papers not meeting the standards of a college-
level essay can be re-written. There will be NO rewrites for the second paper.
You are encouraged to confer with me if you need help with this assignment.**

**  Student papers are to be typed, double-spaced. Each paper should have a
cover sheet with the student's name, the title of the essay, and the following
text:**

> **I, ______________________ [signature], certify that this is a college-
level paper. I have proofread it completely and corrected any spelling or
grammatical errors. I have organized the material and tried to present it in
as clear a manner as possible. I have used my own words throughout the paper
and have limited the use of direct quotes from the sources to a minimum of one
per page. I have enclosed all such direct quotes in quotation marks and have
indicated the source of all quotes and paraphrases. I have attached a
bibliography page listing all sources other than the online primary readings
and my text. I understand that severe penalties will be assessed for sub-
standard writing, use of other writers' words instead of my own and failure to
meet the deadline set for this assignment.**

**  Grading: Your grade is based on 1000+ points. Each test will count 200
points; the first paper will count 100 points; the second will count 200
points. The final exam will count 300 points. Quizzes will count 1 point for
each question. The final total of points will depend on the number of quizzes.
NOTE: No grades will be dropped; missed quizzes cannot be made up but will not
count if you have a valid excuse, and you must take at least three quizzes. In
addition, NO STUDENT WILL BE GIVEN A PASSING GRADE WHO DOES NOT COMPLETE BOTH
IN-CLASS TESTS, BOTH PAPERS, AND THE FINAL EXAM. Provided you have a valid
excuse, make-ups for the two tests will be given on the Reading Day following
the final class session. All make-up tests will consist entirely of essay
questions.**

**  Attendance and Exclusion: Attendance is very important to your success in
this class. I will deduct points for each unexcused absence. Valid excuses are
generally limited to illness or death in the family, AND MUST BE PRESENTED IN
WRITING WITH A THIRD PARTY SIGNATURE ON THE DAY THE STUDENT RETURNS TO
CLASS.**

**  Failure to attend and participate may result in the Dean, upon my written
recommendation, excluding you from the course with a grade of "W." You may
also be excluded from the course (with a grade of "W") by the Dean of the
College upon my recommendation if I feel you are not making adequate progress
in the course. This procedure is not used after the last day for dropping a
course. Please check with me at any time if you think your progress is
unsatisfactory.**

**  The Honor Code: Students at UVA-Wise govern themselves through an honor
system which dates back to the nineteenth century. While the system itself is
primarily student-administered, I am a strong supporter of the code and will
not tolerate violations in the form of lying, cheating, stealing, or
plagiarism. The constitution of the UVAW Honor System is found in the student
handbook, The Source.**

during the semester. Feel free to drop by my office (Zehmer 219) during office
hours. Call for an appointment at other times (376-4573); or you may wish to

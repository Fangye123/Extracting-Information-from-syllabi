**Course Description**

This course focuses on historical and contemporary analysis of class as the
primary determinant of inequality in capitalist society. The course begins
with a review of the main classical sociological theories of class from Marx
and Weber. We will then explore how more recent authors have continued this
area of research in both structural and historical analysis of the development
of classes, and examine recent critique and reformulation of the idea of
class. Finally, we will explore how sociologists have analyzed the interaction
of class with two other main axes of stratification in modern U.S. society,
gender and race.

**Evaluation**

This is one of the primary areas of discussion in sociology and there is a
substantial amount written on it. Consequently, there is a lot of required
reading in the course. Class time will be spent discussing the readings, and
you will be expected to keep up with them during the semester. Each week you
will be expected to email, before the first class, one question and answer
from that weeks reading. These questions should focus on a major theoretical
argument in the readings, and your answer to it should suggest either
additional areas of exploration, or possible critique and future development.
Both the question and answer are expected to be no longer than 100 words
combined. These will be graded on a pass/fail basis, and for each question
that receives a failing mark you will have three days to resubmit for a
passing grade. Failing to turn in a question by Monday will result in a score
of 0.

In addition to these weekly questions, there will be two exam-like paper
assignments given during the course. The first will be handed out in class on
October 23, and expected back by 5:00 on October 26. This exam will cover the
basic theories of Marx and Weber, contemporary structural and historical
understandings of class, and theories of class consciousness. The second will
be handed out on December 11, and expected back by 5:00 on December 17.
Although the final will focus primarily on those readings which come after the
midterm, given that this is a cumulative body of research it will of course
involve concerns from the first half of the course.

Each letter grade from the homework (which will be graded as either A, D, or
F) and the exams will be converted to number from 1 to 4 (1=D, 4=A), and then
weighted as follows: questions 20%, midterm 35%, and final 45%. Final grades
will then be computed as follows: A: 3.4-4, B: 2.4-3.39, C: 1.4-2.39.

**A** s a field of study, history provides the context with which we define
our relationship with our local community, our nation, and the world. Without
the careful study and analysis of history, the lessons of the past are lost.
History offers an ordered account of past experiences and their significance
in our present lives. It transforms obscure, contradictory, and confusing
events into meaningful occurrences. Analyses of how positive changes have been
achieved and how evil has been confronted give us hope to strive for a better
future.  

The past affects and shapes all of our lives. Its study connects diverse
peoples together and provides a measure by which our actions, ideas, goals,
and conduct can be evaluated. Knowledge of the past and an understanding of
current events enables us to link causes and effects, to perceive what we must
maintain or change, and to better analyze political, social, cultural, and
economic events to our greatest advantage.  

The awareness and incorporation of history into our daily lives fosters
personal growth, professional competence, and civic responsibility. Students
who undertake study in history develop a frame of reference with which to
master other disciplines and build a strong foundation for a career in any
field.

Consider supplementing core history requirements with electives that will
sharpen logical, critical, and analytic thinking. A general understanding of
the mathematical sciences, economics, legal studies, and political science,
coupled with the ability to express oneself in both written and spoken
English, is critical. One should select subjects that focus on human thought
and behavior, such as psychology, anthropology, sociology, and comparative
literature. In addition, master the ethical dimensions of life in general
through courses in religion, ethics, logic, and philosophy.

Office Hours: Monday 2:00-3:00 PM

Wednesday 3:00-5:00 PM

**Rationale**

This course is designed to introduce students to formal theoretical work in
sociology. Attention will be devoted to the principles and processes of theory
development and the application of theory in empirical research. This is not a
course in the history of sociological theory or social thought.

**Section I - Meta-theory, Paradigms, and Orienting Strategies**

In this section we will consider the role of meta-theoretical positions within
sociology and the differences between meta-theory and theory. We will also
examine the requirements for a "scientific" sociology.

**Section II - Terms**

In this section we will consider the nature of concepts as used in social
theories and in research and development activities. Particular attention will
be devoted to concept formation and the use of concepts in the context of
theoretical systems.

**Section III - Statements about Social Phenomena**

In this section we will examine the basic proposition or hypothesis and its
role in theory construction and empirical research. The requirements for a
testable hypothesis will be reviewed.

**Section IV - Theories**

In this section we will discuss tools for the analysis of contemporary
sociological theories as well as techniques for constructing theories to guide
research efforts. Particular attention will be devoted to the Hempel,
Oppenheim, and Popper explication of explanation and prediction and the role
of induction, deduction, and retroduction in research.

**Section V - Theory and Empirical Research**

In this section we will examine the role of axiomatic theory in the design of
empirical research. The problems of linking ideas to measures will be
reviewed. The limitations of individual studies and the promise of cumulative
research programs will be discussed.

**Books**

The following books have been ordered for use in the course:

Berger, J., M. Zelditch, Jr., and B. Anderson. (eds.) (1989). _Sociological
Theories in Progress: New Formulations._ Newbury Park, CA: Sage Publications.

Cohen, B. (1989). _Developing Sociological Knowledge: Theory and Method._
Chicago: Nelson Hall.

Kincaid, Harold. (1996). _Philosophical Foundations of the Social Sciences:
Analyzing Controversies in Social Research_. New York: Cambridge University
Press.

Larson, C.J. (1993). _Pure and Applied Sociological Theory: Problems and
Issues_. Fort Worth, TX: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.

Phillips, D.C. (1992). _The Social Scientist's Bestiary_. New York: Pergamon
Press.

**1\. Readings**

Required readings are taken from the three that have been ordered for the
course. The book by Cohen provides a general overview of the approach taken in
this course. The book by Berger, et al. (STP3) provides examples of
contemporary sociological theories. The books by Larson and Kincaid provides a
broader perspective into which the approach taken by Cohen may be set. The
book by Phillips considers challenges to naturalistic social science. The
reading load has been kept light because students are expected to read each
selection from the Berger, et al. volume at least three times. These texts are
not on reserve at the library since it will be necessary for students to mark
up these selections as they read them. Recommended readings provide additional
perspectives on the topics covered each week and may be read at a later time.

**2\. Discussion Leader**

Each student will serve as a discussion leader for one week of the semester.
The task of the discussion leader is to introduce the reading from STP3 for
the week to the class. This will be done in two ways. First, by the Monday
prior to the Wednesday class, the discussion leader should send a brief (two
to three page) e-mail memo to all members of the class. This memo should
highlight the issues for discussion. Second, the discussion leader will
initiate the discussion at the Wednesday class.

**3\. Mid-Term Examination**

A mid-term examination will be given on Wednesday, October 16th during the
regular class hours. The examination will focus on material covered up to that
point in the semester..

**4\. Term Project**

Each student will prepare a term project. The project will be a critical
analysis of one of the theories in STP3 using the tools of analysis developed
in the course. The term projects will be due on Wednesday, December 18th.

**Class Format**

Each class session will consist of two major activities. During the first half
of the session there will be a lecture covering the topic for the week in
theory construction and analysis. The last half of the session will be devoted
to a discussion of the example of contemporary sociological theory assigned
for the week. Throughout the semester we will discuss the readings on the
development and analysis of social theory.

**_Tuesday and Thursday, 9:30-11:00, with additional section  
The meeting place for Thurs 1/25 is 1 HEARST ANNEX. Beginning Tuesday Jan 30,
the course is moving to 182 DWINELLE._**  
  
This course introduces students (both prospective history majors and others)
to the distinctive ways of thinking, writing, and researching that make up the
discipline of History. What are some of the classic historical works of
various cultural traditions? What types of knowledge about the past do
historians claim, and what sorts of questions do they address? What are the
major debates that have preoccupied historians in recent decades, and how have
political or social concerns shaped those debates? What are the materials and
documents they draw upon, and what problems and possibilities attend the use
of different historical sources? What opportunities are there for exciting and
original research on the UC Berkeley campus?

**_History R1 counts for any one of the History major prerequisites. This
course also satisfies either half of the Reading & Composition Requirement.

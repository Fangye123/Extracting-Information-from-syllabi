Note: Academic dishonesty (including plagiarism) will earn you a failing grade
for the course. The 1991-93 UIC Undergraduate Catalog defines academic
dishonesty under the section, "Guidelines Regarding Academic Integrity," and
is available for purchase in the UIC bookstore.

**Goals:** Though this course emphasizes world literature, it is nonetheless
intended to be a basic introduction to the study of literature, and of form,
genre, and trope or figure. The course will cover a variety of historical
periods, and a variety of styles. You will also begin to learn the basics of
writing about literature and will be able to discuss and think about literary
form, value and meaning. The instructor assumes a basic level of competence in
grammar and usage from students entering this course. Attendance: Poor
attendance and tardiness will affect your final grade for the course, at my
discretion.

**Assignments:** You will write a single page reaction paper for each day's
reading and two longer formal essays, each of which is 3-4 pages long.
Additionally there will be a midterm and final.

**Format:** You must type all (repeat, all) written assignments for this
class, including any informal exercises I might assign. Please use one inch
margins all around (top, bottom, left, right).

* * *

**Evaluation:** You will receive four formal grades and one holistic score for
this class. Each of the two exams is worth 20% of your final grade. The two
papers are each worth 30%. I will then modify your writing score by assigning
a holistic score which looks at your performance on informal writing
assignments, and class participation using the following criteria:

_Students who wish to receive a holistic score of HP (High Pass) will:_

* rewrite written assignments as necessary using the suggestions both of their peers and of the instructor. Rewrites will be substantial, involving both rethinking and reorganizing ideas, and correction of all error. 

* perform honestly and well in student peer groups and act as resource for other students. They will offer in-depth criticism of the writing produced by their peers and not allow any personal differences between members of their groups to affect the work of the group. They will meet outside class on their own time if the group decides that additional group time is necessary. They will always provide adequate copies of the work being evaluated and be open to criticism and suggestions for change. 

* take part in all discussions and show evidence of having completed all assigned readings for the course. 

_Students who wish to receive a holistic score of P (Pass) will:_

* rewrite written assignments as necessary using the suggestions both of their peers and of the instructor; their changes will, however, tend to the local (substitution of one word for another, for instance). Their rewrites will not, for the most part, show evidence of reorganization or the creation of new text. There will be very little evidence of a distinction between rewriting and editing, but they will eliminate all grammatical error. 

* take part in all group work, but will not significantly help the other writers in their group. Their criticism will focus mostly on the local level (i.e., "you spelled 'university' with a 'z'"). They will meet outside class times, but only as a last resort. Other group members will need to police them, needing to remind them of meeting times and places. They will often attempt to justify the reasons they "did something" rather than listen to group and consider changes. They will usually provide sufficient copies of work that the group is evaluating. 

* take part in all discussions and show evidence of having completed all assigned readings for the course. 

_Students who wish to receive a holistic score of F (Fail) will:_

* turn in rewrites that show very little evidence of any actual rewriting. There will no or few changes in structure, no or few ideas generated for the rewrite, and little or no creation of any new text. The writer in this category will use no or few suggestions from either the instructor or class peers. 

* contribute little or nothing to peer groups. Students will limit their comments to the affective ("I liked it" or "I didn't like it") but not provide either reasons why or suggestions for further change. The writer in this category will not meet outside class and will miss class sessions when the groups will work during class time. This writer will not turn in materials on time, and will usually not provide adequate numbers of copies of assignments for the group. 

* contribute little or nothing to class discussions, and will show little or no evidence of having read the assigned material for the day. 

**A grade of HP on the holistic score will raise your writing score one whole
grade level. A grade of P will not affect your writing score at all. A grade
of F on the holistic score will lower your writing score one whole grade
level. The modified writing score will be your final grade for the course.
Thus a student with an A and a D for the two papers, and a C and a B for the
two exams would have a final grade of C before modification. If she received a
HP, the final grade would be changed to a B. If she received a holistic score
of P, her final grade would remain a C. A holistic score of F would lower her
final grade to a B.**

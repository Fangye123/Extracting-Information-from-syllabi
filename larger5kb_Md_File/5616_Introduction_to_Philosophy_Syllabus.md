I. COURSE DESCRIPTION

**

This course introduces the general nature of philosophical thought, and its
basic methods and goals. The material covered includes selections by both
current and historically important philosophers (e.g., Plato, Descartes, Hume,
Russell, Perry, Nagel) on such classic philosophical topics as the existence
of God, the nature of right and wrong, and the possibility of knowledge.
Through our readings and discussions we will also attempt to reach a clearer
understanding of ourselves (personal identity), our relationship to other
people (moral responsibility), and our relationship to the world around us
(freedom of the will). Some of the general skills students will develop
include the formulating and defending of theoretical positions and the ability
to think critically about difficult and abstract issues.

About the Requirements:

_

_Class Participation_ \--One thing this requirement covers is your _class
attendance_ (if you don't attend class you can't participate in it). However,
to get an "A" for class participation you must do more than just show up; you
have to contribute to class discussion. You are expected to show up having
read the assignment for the day and ready to talk about it.

_The First Paper_ \--There will be a **3-4 page paper** due in early October.
Topics will be distributed 9 days before the paper is due. Papers are due at
the **beginning** of class on the due date. Late papers are subject to a
substantial grade reduction (you really don't want to find out how much).

_The Second Paper_ \--There will be a second **4-6 page paper** due in early
November. Topics will be handed out about 2 weeks before the paper is due, and
all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late submission
is still not a good idea.

_The Third Paper_ \--There will be a third **4-6 page paper** due in early
December. Again, topics will be distributed 2 weeks before the paper is due,
and all papers are due at the beginning of class on the due date. Late
submission = bad idea.

_The Final Exam_ \--There will be a cumulative final exam given in class on
our last meeting, **Wednesday, December 13th** (which runs on a Thursday
schedule). The exam will consist of short answer questions and essay questions
based on the readings and lectures.

  
**

  
IV. CLASS FORMAT

**

The class will be a mixture of lecture and discussion, and I want to encourage
discussion. I hope that you will all have views about the topics we will
address, and I want you to express and explore those views. It is the nature
of the issues we will be considering that people's views will differ. You are
encouraged to question your classmates (and me) when anyone says something you
disagree with, but everyone should always keep in mind that disagreement is
not a personal attack. Philosophical discussion thrives under this kind of
interaction and often stems from disagreement. At the same time, philosophical
discussion _aims at_ reaching some sort of agreement. We probably won't reach
agreement every time, but we should aspire toward it.

V. TOPICS AND READINGS

**

Most of the readings will be from the Perry and Bratman book. These will be
listed by their pages numbers in parentheses. Readings from the Nagel book are
listed by chapter number.

**A note about the readings:** Philosophical writing is often subtle and
difficult. Do not be fooled by the shortness of an assignment into thinking
that it will take little time. Most of these readings should be read _at least
twice_. I recommend a first time straight through and then a second time
slowly while taking notes.

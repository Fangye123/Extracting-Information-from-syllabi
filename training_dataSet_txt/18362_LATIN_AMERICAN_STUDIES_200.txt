COURSE PURPOSE:
This is an interdisciplinary course that introduces you to the cultures and societies of Latin
America. In each section of the course you gain an appreciation for the major topics, themes, and
processes that have shaped (and continue to shape) Latin America. You benefit from the unique perspectives and insights that
each discipline has to offer. Each participating instructor has a broad and deep level of interest
and experience in the region, which serves to enrich the learning process. This course satisfies
Category E (World Cultures) of the University's General Education requirements.
REQUIRED READING:
(1) Hillman, Richard S. (ed.) (2001) Understanding Contemporary Latin America, 2nd. Edn.; Available at the
College Bookstores (probably shelved under GEOG200 or one of the crosslisted course numbers); 
(2) Knapp, Gregory (ed.) (2002) Latin America in the Twentyfirst Century: Available at the College Bookstores. 
(3) Material provided by the instructors TBA.
GRADING:
 There are three exams in this course (two one-hour section exams and the final two-hour exam,
all of which are multiple choice in format). Each section exam is worth 30% (150 points) and the final
exam is worth 20% (100 points).  Forty bonus points will be allocated to the highest of
your exam scores.  Attendance and participation are expected and are crucial to your 
success in this course. Twelve percent of the course grade (60 points) is allocated
for attendance, participation, and reading assignments. Total points available for the course equal 500. Grades are
allocated as follows: A = 90-100%; B = 80-89.9%; C = 70-79.9%; D = 60-69.9%; 
F = <60%.
ATTENDANCE POLICY:
Please make every effort to come to class on time. The class ends at 3:15 pm, so do not begin
packing up materials until the appropriate time as it disturbs other students.  If you
attend class, the instructor will assume that you are present to learn the course
material, not to talk with your neighbors, read the newspaper, or do homework for
another class.  Please turn off your cellphones or put them on vibrate while you are in this class. 
If these rules are not to your liking, I urge you to drop this course
immediately and take something else.  Those students who stay with the course and who
attend regularly generally get more from the course than students who miss class. 
Absences (both excused and unexcused) will have a negative effect on your grade. 
Excused absences are given only for official academic/university related activities
that are communicated to the instructor BEFORE the beginning of class or for special
DOCUMENTED situations (illness, for example).  Any student who accummulates 9 absences or any type, will receive an automatic "F" for the course.
In any event, a student MUST be present in class to receive the daily attendance
points for that class.  All exams must be completed as scheduled in order to complete the course. Make-up exams are given only under VERY SPECIAL 
circumstances.  Students are reminded that they are allowed only to sign THEIR OWN NAME on the attendance sheet!

** NOTE: Latin American Studies 200 strictly adheres to the course drop policy found in the
Undergraduate and Graduate catalogs. It is the sole responsibility of individual students to meet
the cited deadlines for dropping a course. In exceptional cases the deadline for schedule changes
(dropping a course) may be waived. The successful waiver will require a written description of
extenuating circumstances and relevant documentation. Poor academic performance, general
malaise, or undocumented general stress factors are NOT considered legitimate extenuating
circumstances. Since the granting of such waivers is rare, we urge you to follow the established
guidelines.

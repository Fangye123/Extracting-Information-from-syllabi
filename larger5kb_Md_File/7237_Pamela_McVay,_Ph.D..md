This page lists reading and homework assignments for HI 207. It also contains
links to WEB sites recommended in your syllabus. I will add WEB sites as I
become aware of them. Most of these come from Paul Halsall's "[Internet East
Asian History
Sources](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/eastasia/eastasiasbook.html)" WEB
site, which you will also find on the "electronic reference desk" of the
college library catalogue. The information I provide here is for your
convenience, and I try to keep it up to date, but I may sometimes be behind in
updating it. Use this page, but keep two things in mind:

1) what I tell you in class ALWAYS supersedes anything you might see on the
WEB site.  
2) if you have a question about the homework or aren't sure if the assignment
on the WEB agrees with what we discussed in class, call me to ask.

**US 350  Introduction to Culture I**

Return to top.

Dr. McVay Place: Mullen 351 Time: Tuesdays 10-12:30; Thursdays 7:9:30; Final:
THURSDAY December 16, 10:30-12:30 OR Thursday, December 16, 7:35-9:35

Office: Mullen 337 Office Hours: Wednesday 1-3, Thurs. 3-6:30 and by
appointment Phone: (440) 646-8396

GOALS OF THE COURSE: This course has several purposes. First and foremost, I
hope Introduction to Culture will stimulate in you an interest in art,
literature, philosophy, or music, and in the different cultures we study. One
of the great benefits of a liberal arts education is that it prepares you for
life-long learning and independent appreciation of the best that human culture
has to offer. Introduction to Culture is intended to help you increase your
capacity to enjoy and learn from the world around you.

Second, Introduction to Culture introduces you to the modes of analysis used
in the arts and humanities, in order to prepare you for the rest of your work
in "Stage Two" satellite courses. I will ask you to express opinions about
works of art and literature, just as you were asked in the introductory
seminar. But in US 350 and US 350 we expect your opinions to be strongly based
on the materials we study and to demonstrate an understanding, if not
agreement with, the writers we read and the cultural influences on their work.
To that end we will learn some of the vocabulary of different disciplines in
the humanities and some of the most common strategies humanists and artists
use to interpret materials.

Third, in US 350 and US 351 we also continue to help you improve your writing
and speaking skills. We will work on some specific details of how to organize
and support an expository essay or presentation. But we will also work on
understanding the beauty and power of language and the way writers use
language to achieve various goals. To write and speak clearly, gracefully, and
effectively is an ongoing challenge, and even the best writers need continual
practice and criticism to keep their skills honed. I urge you to make time to
meet with me a couple of times during the semester to discuss some of your
written work in detail, and to make use of the writing instruction provided in
the student services office. The College's Writing Specialist can also be very
helpful. Don't make the mistake of thinking that only students with weak
writing skills need extra help! The greater your facility with language, the
more useful an expert instructor can be.

SPECIAL ASPECTS OF INTRODUCTION TO CULTURE Introduction to Culture is a little
different from courses you may have taken in the past in History, Social
Studies, Art, or Literature. The units of the course are not cumulative, the
way they would be in a History, Math, or Drawing course. Instead, these
courses teach you skills that help you understand people from backgrounds
different from your own. We do this by introducing you to the cultural
products and value systems of several cultures from long ago and far away. You
will undertake individual research on an unfamiliar culture of your own
choice, and you will continue to work on your skills as a writer, speaker, and
team member. By doing these things, you will have experience and practice with
relating to those who are unfamiliar. These cultures may seem strange,
foreign, and unrelated to your personal goals right now. But later the skills
you learn here will help you connect with clients, customers, colleagues, and
people you meet on the street.

ASSESSMENT

Weekly homework and classroom discussion: 15% 3 short papers 30% 3 drafts of
short papers: (pass/fail) 15% Preliminary bibliography(group project) 10%
Annotated bibliography (group project) 10% Class presentation (group project)
20% Total: 100%

WEEKLY HOMEWORK AND CLASSROOM DISCUSSION: 15% You will find weekly study
questions and study terms on the schedule of assignments. You should arrive in
class each week prepared to discuss these in small groups and with the class
in general, and with at least short answers to each question jotted down. Each
of you will also be responsible for leading classroom discussion of one (1) of
the assigned readings for twenty (20) minutes. The purpose of this
presentation is threefold. First, it will ensure that at least some of our
classroom discussions of texts and works of art builds on your interests and
interpretations rather than mine. Second, it will give you practice thinking
about ways to engage the interest of your colleagues, a useful skill in the
"real" world outside of College. Third, it will ensure that your final class
presentation will not be the first moment you speak formally before the class.

THREE SHORT PAPERS 30% For each of the three sections of this semester
(Athens, Rome, Heian) you will write one short paper on the instructor's
choice of topics. The papers will be typed, double-spaced, and 500-600 words
long. Each will have an original and explanatory title (i.e., "Individualism
in Greek Tragedy as seen in Homer's Illiad and Sophocles' Antigone," not
"Athens Paper") and a clear thesis. All will have unified paragraphs, in which
the topic sentence controls the supporting sentences and is directly and
obviously related to the thesis. All will have a conclusion that restates the
main point(s) of the paper. The selection of topics available to you is listed
on each of the due dates for the first drafts. More details will be
forthcoming.

THREE DRAFTS OF THREE SHORT PAPERS 15% The week before the final draft of each
paper is due, your earlier draft is due. This should be a full draft of the
paper, not a sketchy paragraph or two.

GROUP PROJECT AND PRESENTATION Each student will join a group of 2-3 others in
a group project. For this group project, the individual student will prepare
two INDIVIDUAL, PERSONAL bibliographies, but the GROUP WILL DO A FINAL
PRESENTATION TOGETHER. Each group will choose one cultural area (not in
Western Europe) during one period before 1800, and they will teach the class
about that area on the final day(s) of class. Each individual student will
specialize in one aspect of that cultural area and time, and be the expert for
her/his group.

PRELIMINARY BIBLIOGRAPHY 10% Students will identify twenty-five books,
articles, and reference sources related to their cultural area and individual
specialization, and prepare a correctly documented bibliography of those
materials. NO, THIS DOES NOT MEAN YOU'VE READ ALL OF THE MATERIALS. IT DOESN'T
EVEN MEAN YOU'VE TOUCHED ALL OF THEM. The reference librarians and I will
teach you how to compile a bibliography.

ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY 10% Students will narrow their individual, specialized
bibliography to fifteen items. Then, they will provide a brief description of
each of these items and an analysis of each items' merits and/or defects. In
this case, you will have to have examined all of the items in the
bibliography, but this does not mean you will have read them all. After having
compiled the preliminary bibliography, you will probably have to have read one
or two extended general introductions to your topic and three to five
articles. The reference librarians and I will teach you how to examine a book
or article you haven't read thoroughly in order to put it in an annotated
bibliography.

GROUP PROJECT PRESENTATION 20% Throughout the semester you will work with your
small group. As a group, you must decide which aspects of your culture and of
your various specialized areas are most important/interesting, and then you
should teach them to the group. You will work closely together, use more than
one instructional medium, find ways to have students interact with the
material you present, and cooperate with each other throughout the
presentation. More details will be forthcoming later.

Peloponnesian Wars, Antigone, and Crito in your textbook, do you find evidence
to support this statement? Be specific. 3. What values/ideals do the

Plato's summary of a part of Socrates' life) 5. Summarize Plato's theory of
forms. Can you relate it to the "Allegory of the Cave"? Point to specific
passages that seem important to you. 6. After reading the passage of the
Nicomachean Ethics in your textbook (a Herculean task in and of itself),
consider Aristotle's so-called "Doctrine of the Mean." Do you agree that "the

15. What do historians mean when they speak of Renaissance writers as
humanists? 16. Fiero says that "The pursuit of money and leisure, rather than
a preoccupation with feudal or chivalric obligations, marked the life-style of
merchants and artisans who lived in the bustling city-states of Italy." To
what extent does this seem like a good characterization of Benvenuto Cellini?
Why or why not? Give examples from Cellini's autobiography. 17\. Compare

and Machiavelli. What would these writers think of Cellini, and why?

Would you say he, like other artists of the period, combined an "interest in
Greco-Roman art with an impassioned desire to understand the natural world and
imitate its visual appearance"? 19. What would you say are Cellini's core
values? Were those values in harmony with those of other men of his station in
life? Use evidence from his autobiography and from our textbooks to support

Schedule:Women of the Renaissance (return to main page)

Ever wonder what all the women were doing while Michelangelo was lying on his
back in the Sistine Chapel? Take History 320 and find out! In this class we'll
examine European women between 1350 and 1750.We'll ask what their society
expected of them, what they expected of their society, and how they worked to
achieve their goals. Students will write three short papers on subjects set by
the instructor, two short comparison/contrast papers (book reviews) on a topic
of their own choice, and turn in weekly homework assignments.

**Suggested readings in the College Bookstore** : Rosa. The Writer's Brief
Handbook. Any edition. Gloria Fiero, The Humanistic Tradition, v. 3. Any
edition. This is a good introduction to the Renaissance if you aren't familiar
with the period.

Goals for the Course:

We will try to understand and learn from the lives of women who lived during
the Renaissance. To what extent did they share in the great transformations of
artistic, intellectual, economic, and political life of the Renaissance, and
to what extent did their lives remain the same? We will read their words, look
at their art, and read modern scholarship about them. Students will learn to
evaluate primary and secondary sources and to write in a style appropriate to
the discipline of history.

**Assessment:** The student will be graded on the basis of homework, map
quizzes, two short (500-600 word) papers on topics of the instructor's
choosing, and on the presentations and book reviews associated with her/his
individual project.

**Class Participation** (homework and discussion): 15% (pass/fail) Map Quiz:
5% Map Project: 10% 2 Short papers: 30% Individual Project presentations: 20%
2 Book reviews: 20% Total: 100%

**Class Participation** : Each week I will assign terms and/or study
questions. The student should briefly define the terms and answer the study
questions in short outline or short-answer form. Some study questions will be
labeled Challenge questions. Students will choose from among the Challenge
questions to write their short papers. Students should come to class prepared
for vigorous discussion of the readings, terms, and questions. The first few
sets of homework, as well as all four challenge questions, are provided on the
syllabus.. The first week is especially and unfortunately heavy, because of
the large number of map terms.

**Map Quiz** : A basic familiarity with the geographical features and major
political divisions of Western Europe being necessary for even casual
discussion of the Renaissance, we will study some of these features. I will
give you terms for the map quiz one week ahead of time.

**Map Project** : Students will choose one country or region to specialize in
for the semester. They will draw a series of maps showing 1) major geographic
features 2) cities 3) agricultural products of the region. Yes, you may trace
your maps.

**Short papers** : The student will write two short (500-600 word) papers
based on the homework Challenge questions. (However, if you have a burning
desire to write on a different topic, talk with me and I'll try to accommodate
you) You should not have to do additional research to write these papers.

**Individual Project** : The student will choose topic to specialize in. The
student will read two books (or substitute 3 articles for a book) by and/or
about women from that region. Associated with these two books, the student
will make two presentations and write two book reviews. For more information,
see below.

**Presentations** : Students will make two presentations, one for each of the
two books chosen for their individual project. They will specialize topically,
choosing books or articles dealing with one of the chapter subjects in Merry
Wiesner's _Women and Gender in Early Modern Europe_. They will make their
presentations during one of the classes in which the relevant Wiesner chapter
is discussed and compared with other readings.

Presentations should 1) summarize the author's or authors' main points (no
more than 3 main points, please) 2) give examples of the kinds of evidence,
especially the kinds of primary sources, supporting the main points 3) present
the class with several "thought" questions relating the book or articles to
the works we are reading on the subject. Each student should prepare to speak
for ten minutes, and to lead discussion/answer questions for ten to fifteen
minutes. Be aware that your colleagues will often ask more questions and
develop more insights than you have planned for. It is better to say less and
answer questions later than to lecture overtime and deprive your colleagues of
discussion time.

For example, a student specializing in the female life-cycle would make a
presentation the week we read chapter 2, "The female life-cycle," and their
final presentation on December 14 at the Roundtable. She or he might choose
two books from Wiesner's bibliography, perhaps Annik Pardaithe-Galabrun, The
Birth of Intimacy: Private and Domestic Life in Early Modern Paris and James
Traer, Marriage and Family in Eighteenth Century France, both listed in
Wiesner's bibliography. She or he would present the Pardaithe-Galabrun book
one week, and the Traer on December 14.

**Book Reviews** : Students will write reviews of their books or articles.
Reviews should begin with a complete bibliographical citation of the articles
or book discussed, preferably including ISBN number and list price, if the
book is still in print (check amazon.com for this information). They should
summarize the main points of the author's or authors' arguments (no more than
three main points, please). They should discuss the evidence the author or
authors present to support their arguments. What are the strengths of this
evidence? What are its possible weaknesses? Good historians will often tell
you this in their introductions. Finally, the book review should put the work
in context. How does this book or these articles relate to the other works we
are reading on this topic? The first book review will be due one week after
the presentation related to it. The second book review is due December 14.
Please note that the book review is not a simple summary of everything in the
book or articles you have read. It is an analysis of the arguments presented,
an assessment of the evidence presented in favor of those arguments, and an
evaluation of the work in relationship to other works we have read on that
topic. It should be short--no more than 3-4 typed pages, and preferably 2-3
pages, presuming you're using 10-point type.

**What do I do if Wiesner's bibliography doesn't quite deal with the
geographic area I want, or if I want to read a primary source by/about women
on my topic instead of a secondary source and can't find one in Wiesner?** Of
course, you can always ask me for assistance. If you choose a work from a
reputable bibliographical source that seems somewhat related to the topic, I
will be satisfied.. Wiesner's bibliography is an excellent starting point, but
it is not meant to be exhaustive. The Dictionary of the Middle Ages, the
Encyclopedia of the Reformation, and the databases Contemporary Women's Issues
and Historical Abstracts can help you find articles and primary sources. The
journals Signs: Women in Culture and Society and Journal of Women's History
provide book reviews and review articles that can point you toward interesting
readings. The Ralph M. Besse library has a strong collection of writings by
English women of the Renaissance, and a fair collection of materials
translated from French and Italian women writers. Another useful place to look
for titles of primary sources, believe it or not, is amazon.com. If you type
in the name of one Renaissance woman writer, look at the list they provide of
"other books purchased by people who bought this one." Often this will include
translations of primary sources. DO vet these materials with me, however.

**Homework:** Each week I will assign terms and/or study questions. The
student should define the terms and answer the study questions in short answer
or outline form. I will collect homework at the beginning of class. You will
base your short papers on one of the highlighted challenge questions
(student's choice). You should be able to answer the challenge questions
without using outside readings.

**Map Quiz** : A basic familiarity with the geographical features and major
political divisions of the world being necessary for even casual discussion of
world history, we will study some of these features and have one quiz based on
them. The quiz terms are listed on the syllabus under the second week's
homework.

**Map Project** : Students will choose one major region to specialize in for
the semester. They will draw a series of 3 maps showing 1) major geographic
features 2) cities 3) agricultural products of the region. Yes, you may trace
your maps. Possibilities include: East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia,
Central Asia, The Middle East, West Africa, Southern Africa, East Africa,

write on a different topic, talk with me and I'll try to accommodate you). You
should not have to do additional research to write these papers. However, you
may choose questions related to your individual project, but if you do I
expect to see you refer to your additional readings. Otherwise, y

**Individual Project** : The student will choose a topic to specialize in. She
or he will make two presentations and write two book reviews on that topic See
"Presentations" and "Book Reviews" below. The topic will be based on one of
the bibliographies presented for a particular class meeting. On September 29,
for example, the two possible projects are the American Revolution and the
Haitian Revolution. If you chose "The Haitian Revolution", then your
presentations will be about two of the books from that bibliography, and you
will write a review for each of the two books. You would make the first
presentation on September 29, and your first book review would be due the next
class period after that.. Your second presentation will be on either December
8 or 15th, with the second book review due the 115th.

**Presentations** : Students will make two presentations, one for each of the
two books chosen for their individual project. Students will specialize in one
of the short bibliographies listed under each week's assignments. Students
will read two books or (in rare cases) a book and one article on a topic. The
first presentation, made the day the project appears on the syllabus, will be
a "full" presentation lasting a total of 15 to 20 minutes. The second will be
a brief discussion and analysis presented at the final roundtable discussions
on December 8 and December 15. Only the first presentation will be graded; the
second counts toward the weekly homework assignments.

Presentations should 1) summarize the author's or authors' main points (no
more than 3 main points, please) 2) give examples of the kinds of evidence,
especially the kinds of primary sources, supporting the main points 3) present
the class with one or two "thought" questions relating the book or articles to
the works we are reading on the subject Each student should prepare to speak
for five minutes, and to lead discussion/answer questions for ten to fifteen
minutes. Be aware that your colleagues will often ask more questions and
develop more insights than you have planned for. It is better to say less and
answer questions later than to lecture overtime and deprive your colleagues of
discussion time. Since most of you will be presenting the same day as one
other colleague working on the same project, it would be best to coordinate
your questions for the class.

**Book Reviews** : Students will write reviews of their books or articles.
Reviews should begin with a complete bibliographical citation of the articles
or book discussed, preferably including ISBN number and list price, if the
book is still in print (check amazon.com for this information). They should
summarize the main points of the author's or authors' arguments (no more than
three main points and two paragraphs, please). They should discuss the
evidence the author or authors present to support their arguments. What are
the strengths of this evidence? What are its possible weaknesses? Good
historians will often tell you this in their introductions. Finally, the book
review should put the work in context. How does this book or these articles
relate to the other materials in World Civilizations and The Human Record we
are reading on this topic? The first book review will be due one week after
the presentation related to it. The second book review is due December 14.
Please note that the book review is not a simple summary of everything in the
book or articles you have read. It is an analysis of the arguments presented,
an assessment of the evidence used to support those arguments, and an
evaluation of the work in relationship to other works we have read on that
topic. It should be short--no more than 3-4 typed pages, and preferably 2-3
pages, presuming you're using 10-point type.

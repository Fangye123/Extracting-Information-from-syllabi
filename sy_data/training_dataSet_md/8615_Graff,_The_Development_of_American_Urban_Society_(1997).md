The Development of American Urban Society offers a thematic and chronological
overview of the development of cities and urban society in North America from
the early modern era to the present. Toward that end, we examine both the
factors that stimulated and shaped urban development and the impact of
urbanization during a critical period in the history of American, and Western,
civilization. Of principal concern are the consequences of urban life and the
configurations of social and spatial forms as they differed by time, place,
class, ethnic group, race, and gender. In part, we seek to understand the
social, economic, political, and cultural dimensions of a set of the most
significant changes that have transformed society over the past several
centuries; in part, we seek to understand better the causes of our own
contemporary "urban crisis" and the future(s) that lurk beyond it. Thus, we
focus on such topics as urban societies, spatial organization, migration,
urban systems, city life and cultural styles, technology and communications,
and the tensions between forces of centralization and decentralization.
Special attention is given to United States developments, but within a
comparative North American and Western European perspective, and to the period
from the mid-eighteenth through the late-twentieth centuries.

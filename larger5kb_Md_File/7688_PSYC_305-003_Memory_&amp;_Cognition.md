**Course Objectives**

Where did I leave my bicycle? How do I recognize my grandmother? How do I
solve an algebra problem? How do I understand this paragraph of text?
Cognitive psychology deals with how the mind works --- how we remember things,
how we solve problems, how we use language, how we perceive the world. In this
course we will explore how cognitive psychologists use experiments to address
these and similar issues. The course will cover in some detail (a) basic
experimental design, (b) cognitive processing, and (c) experimental design as
it is applied to issues in human memory and cognition.

Psychology 305 requires a working knowledge of statistics. We will be
discussing specific experimental designs and their relationship to statistical
tests by the second week of class, and students are expected to have completed
Psychology 300 or equivalent with a minimum grade of C prior to enrolling in
Psychology 305.

**Laboratory**

You must be enrolled in one of the lab sections associated with this course.
Please attend the section in which you are enrolled. A lab syllabus will be
distributed during the first lab period. Your lab instructor is responsible
for the labs and lab grades. The lab grade will constitute 35% of the final
grade. The specific breakdown of lab assignments and their relative values
will be discussed in the labs. If you are not enrolled in a lab, you will not
receive a grade for this course.

In addition to the texts above, you should have access to the Publication
Manual of the American Psychological Association (4th Edition). All lab
reports must be written in APA style and format. The web page at
http://webster.commnet.edu/apa/apa_index.htm contains a good summary of how to
write up a lab report in APA style.



**Examinations and Grading**

There will be two midterms and one final exam based on readings and lectures.
Dates for the exams are given below and in the course outline. The exams will
consist of multiple-choice, short-answer, and essay questions. The final exam
will be cumulative; it will cover all material introduced since the beginning
of the course.

In addition to the exams, there will also be several surprise quizzes based on
the reading material for that week. Each quiz will occur on at the beginning
of class (on either Tuesdays or Thursdays), and will consist of five multiple-
choice questions. There will not be a quiz every week, but it could occur on
any week (see course outline for possible quiz dates and assigned readings for
each quiz). The purpose of the quizzes is quite simple: to encourage everyone
to do the readings in advance, thereby improving learning.

Grading will be weighted as follows:

_% of course grade Date_

Quizzes 15% (total) each week

Midterm #1 15% Oct 14th

Midterm #2 15% Dec 7th

Final Exam 20% Dec 16th

Lab Grade 35%

No make-up exams will be given except in cases of documented emergencies. All
make-up exams will consist completely of essay questions. There will be no
make-up quizzes. Instead, if a quiz is missed, to avoid receiving a zero for
that quiz, a 500-word paper must be written. The topic for these make-up
papers is as follows: take some aspect of the material covered in the quiz and
describe the implications of that aspect for how this course could be designed
better (i.e., to improve student learning). The papers must be typed and
turned in no later than 1 week after the quiz was given. More information
about the make-up papers can be found on the web.



**Honor Code**

All exams and reports must follow the guidelines of the GMU Honor Code.
Students may use books, notes, and other sources in preparing for exams and
lab reports. Other students may be consulted. However, when taking exams, no
books, notes, or student interaction will be allowed. Lab reports are expected
to be the student's own work. This work includes library references,
statistics, and reports of the research studies. Students may, of course, seek
help in answering questions pertaining to general laboratory procedure,
statistics to be used as well as statistical procedures, APA style and format,
etc.



**Attendance**

Class attendance is essential, as the lectures will frequently present
information not found in the textbooks, and the material for the exams will be
drawn from both lectures and readings. Having the notes available on the web
is not a replacement for attending class: important information is missing
from these notes (because it will be said during the lecture).



**Special Help**

If you have a disability documented by the Disability Support Services Office,
which requires special conditions for exams (extended time, large type, etc.),
see me the first week of classes.

**Course Outline**

Any schedule changes or changes in assignments will be announced in class in
advance. After an absence, students are responsible for contacting the
instructor to obtain accurate information.

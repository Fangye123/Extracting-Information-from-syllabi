### History 525  
Topics in Women's History:  
Women in European History, 1900-1945



This course is designed as a survey of European women's history in the first
half of the twentieth century. We will focus on a number of selected topics,
including the changing meanings and understandings of gender; the changing
meanings and significance of family, motherhood and marriage; demographic
changes and shifts in female employment; women's involvement in political
movements and women's relationship to the state; expressions and regulations
of female sexuality; and women and popular culture. Reflecting the current
scholarship, emphasis will be on France, Germany and Great Britain, but
studies of other countries will also be included, and cross-cultural
comparisons will be encouraged.



_Course objectives_

  1. The students will gain familiarity with central aspects of the history of European women in the first half of the twentieth century. 
  2. The student will become familiar with different approaches to the study of women's history. 
  3. The student will gain an understanding of the role of women and gender in large-scale historical developments. 



_Course requirements_

The most important requirement for this class is your active and constant
participation throughout the quarter. You will be asked to read a number of
articles and/or sections of books for each class period. (Please note that the
reading schedule is listed below. It will not be announced in class.) I expect
you to come to class with these readings completed, prepared to ask questions
and participate in a discussion.

In addition to this, you will be asked to complete a number of in-class
writing assignments based on the readings and on the lectures and discussions.
You will also be asked to turn in two short written assignments (4-5 typed
pages) in the course of the quarter. This written work replaces a mid-term
exam. (I will give you further information about the topics of these written
assignments in class.)

Finally, you will be asked to complete the course with a written, in-class
final exam.



_Extra-credit work_

In connection with this course, I recommend that you watch one or more
relevant films. The titles of the films that I recommend are listed on the
syllabus, but they will not be shown in class. Instead you may check out
copies of the films from the public library or from a commercial video rental
store, and view them outside of class.

To obtain extra credit, you will be required to turn in a one page paper, in
which you discuss the relevance of the film to the material covered in class.
Papers will be due in class on the Monday following the date listed on the
syllabus. Each extra credit assignment you complete will be counted as two
points towards your class participation grade.



_Required reading_

The following book, available on reserve at the main library and through the
SBX bookstore, is required reading for the course:

> Mary Felstiner: _To Paint Her Life: Charlotte Salomon in the Nazi Era_
(1994)

In addition, you will be asked to read a number of book chapters and xeroxed
articles, all of which will be available to you through library reserve. You
may also purchase a copy of the readings from Cop-Ez Copies, 60 Bricker Hall.
Ask for the course packet for History 525.

If you wish to supplement the readings with a text that provides a general
overview of European women's history, I recommend that you purchase a copy of
Bonnie Smith: _Changing Lives: Women in European History Since 1700_. This
textbook is also available through SBX.



_Grading_

Your grade will be based on your attendance, participation and written work.

Come to class. Listen, discuss, ask questions, contribute your ideas. It's
part of learning and part of your grade. I do not take attendance, but
noticeable absences will lower your grade.

The following percentages represent the relative weight that will be given to
each component of the course. These are guidelines, not hard and fast rules. I
reward progress and effort. Please feel free to discuss your general standing
with me at any time during the quarter.

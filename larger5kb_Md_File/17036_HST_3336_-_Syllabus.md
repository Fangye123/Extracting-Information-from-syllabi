In this century, a central concern of European thought has been the relation
between what may seem quite disparate and unrelated phenomena: "politics" and
"culture." This course will explore the dynamic interaction of these forces,
examing the politics of culture as well as the culture of politics as they
have developed in twentieth-century European societies.

To do so, we will examine both major political events of the twentieth century
--the two World Wars, the Russian Revolution, the Spanish Civil War--and what
has been called the "politics of everyday life." We will atttempt to identify
cultural influences on, representations of, and responses to the political. In
addition to printed texts, we will explore film, photography and painting as
political tools and as forms of cultural expression. The class will combine
lectures with frequent discussions.

**JOURNAL REQUIREMENTS**

Your journal is due at the beginning of class on February 19th (minimum 5
entries), April 2nd (minimum 5 entries), and April 30th (minimum 5 entries).

>   1. You must write an entry for each reading assignment. This includes the
7 required books and the additional articles (address all the articles
assigned for a particular day in a single entry) for a total of 9 entries.

>

>   2. You must also write an entry for each of the 7 films.

>

>   3. You must, over the course of your journal, write additional entries for
at least 4 class meetings. These can be responses to lectures or discussions.

>

>

Your journal entries should be between 50 and 100 words. I do not expect
perfectly polished prose. You should type your entries. Place each entry on a
separate sheet of paper and identify its source with a title across the top.
Place the entries in a folder with your name on it. Your entries for the
readings should be written **before** the class in which we discuss the texts,
though you can if you wish add entries after discussions.

The purpose of a journal is to give you the freedom to express your initial
reaction to the course materials. At the same time, your journal should show a
growing intellectual sophistication about the material. Avoid the "isn't this
awful" response and do not summarize the material. Instead, try to understand
and to contextualize the material and its implications. You may compare
readings and draw upon previously discussed material to understand each text.
I will specifically be looking for an intellectual effort to understand and
situate the material within a historical context. I will also be looking for
improvement in your understanding of the material.

This course will present a critical examination of entertainment, information,
and news media with an emphasis on visual modes. We will begin by building a
theoretical base with which to analyze media products, drawing in several
different perspectives including critical and cultural studies approaches.
Underlying the course is an assumption that the media play an enormous role in
the construction of identity, politics, and culture and that we must
critically analyze the pervasive "media culture" we find ourselves in. To this
end, we will be examining issues around media ownership and structure, as well
as paying close attention to the ways race, gender, and class are presented in
media products. Using various theoretical lenses we will look at a wide
variety of topics including advertising, music videos, soaps, news, and the
Internet. Upon successful completion of this course you will be able to
demonstrate a critical understanding of major theoretical frameworks for
analyzing media, as well as the ability to apply those theories to specific
media products and genres.

>> The following is taken from the [NCSU Handbook on Advising and
Teaching](http://www.ncsu.edu/provost/hat/current/appendix/appen_k.html). If
you have arrangements with the Office of Disability Services please make sure
to speak with me about them as soon as possible.

>>> NC State is subject to the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
regulations implementing Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.
Section 504 provides that:

>>>

>>> No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States. . .
shall, solely by reason of his handicap be excluded from participation in, be
denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any program or
activity receiving Federal financial assistance.

>>>

>>> This regulation includes students with hearing, visual, motor, or learning
disabilities and states that colleges and universities must make 'reasonable
adjustments' to ensure that academic requirements are not discriminatory.
Modifications may require rescheduling classes from inaccessible to accessible
buildings, providing access to auxiliary aids such as tape recorders, special
lab equipment, or other services such as readers, note takers, or
interpreters. It further requires that exams actually evaluate students'
progress and achievement rather than reflect their impaired skills. This may
require oral or taped tests, readers, scribes, separate testing rooms, or
extension of time limits.

>>>

>>> Section 84.47 (b) of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
regulations implementing Section 504 deals in particular with academic and
vocational counseling. When advising disabled students, advisers should be
careful not to guide them, because of their handicap, toward a more
restrictive program or career than would be appropriate for a non-disabled
student. Factual information, such as licensing requirements, etc., that may
present obstacles to disabled students should they decide to pursue a
particular career or program, may be presented in an objective fashion.

>

> _Statement on Academic Integrity_ :

>

>> The following is only a brief excerpt from the [NCSU Code of Student
Conduct](http://www.fis.ncsu.edu/ncsulegal/codeof.htm). You are responsible
for reading the complete document and upholding all of the standards detailed.
Please speak to me if you have any questions regarding it.

>>

>>> The free exchange of ideas depends on the participants' trust that they
will be given credit for their work. Everyone in an academic community must be
responsible for acknowledging, using the methods accepted by the various
academic disciplines, their use of others' words and ideas. Since intellectual
workers' words and ideas constitute a kind of property, plagiarism is theft.
Plagiarism and cheating are attacks on the very foundation of academic life,
and cannot be tolerated within universities.

>>>

>>> Definitions: Academic dishonesty is the giving, taking, or presenting of
information or material by you with the intent of unethically or fraudulently
aiding yourself or another on any work which is to be considered in the
determination of a grade or the completion of academic requirements. You are
guilty of academic dishonesty if you:

>>>

>>> * represent the work of others as your own;  
>  * get assistance in any academic work from another individual in a
situation in which you are expected to perform independently;  
>  * give assistance to another individual in a situation in which that
individual is expected to perform independently;  
>  * offer false data in support of laboratory or field work.

>>>

>>> In addition, cheating includes, "submitting, without prior permission of
the instructor, any work by a student which has at any time been submitted in
identical or similar form by that student in fulfillment of any other academic
requirement at any institution."

>>

>> _ADA Information_ :

>>

>>> "Reasonable accommodations will be made for students with verifiable
disabilities. In order to take advantage of available accommodations, students
must register with Disability Services for Students at 1900 Student Health
Center, Campus Box 7509, 515-7653. For more information on NC State's policy
on working with students with disabilities, please see

>> _Departmental Equity Statement_ :

>>

>>> "All persons regardless of age, race, religion, gender, physical
disability, or sexual orientation shall have equal opportunity without
harassment in Department of Communication courses and programs. Any harassment
should be reported immediately to either the classroom instructor or the
department head."

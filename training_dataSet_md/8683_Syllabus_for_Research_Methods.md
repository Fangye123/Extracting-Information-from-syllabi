**Required Reading:[Navigation Guide](../navigation.htm) to Online Course**

**Course Description:**

**This is an introductory, self-paced course in social science research
methodology. It is designed to introduce the student to basic concepts and
problems encountered in social scientific investigation, including types of
data and measurement, sampling, probability, and research design.   This
course will emphasize the importance and limitations of theory and methodology
in social science research as well as the purposes of applied research,
program evaluation, policy analysis, and research ethics.**

**This is the same course and identical to SOC 308, POL 308, and JUS 308 as
traditionally taught. College requirements mandate a prerequisite of MAT 213
(Elementary Statistics) to take this course, although in the past, hard-
working and deserving students have been allowed in without MAT 213 (depending
on their math placement score), and concurrent registration in JUS 308 and MAT
213 is of course allowed. If you are unsure about your current math skills,
take the following[QUIZ](quantit.htm), while not officially a placement test,
should indicate your readiness to take this course depending upon how much
difficulty these basic math questions pose for you. However, even if the
questions are easy for you, this is no guarantee you will do well in the
course.**

**Required Readings:**

**The textbook is a required purchase. Along with the Lecture Notes (e-book
provided online), these   make up the primary readings. By registering for
this course, students are expected to have access and proficiency at using
computers to browse the Internet, send and receive emails, attach documents
(Microsoft Word format) to emails, and participate in group discussions on
community bulletin boards. The course meets face-to-face as scheduled, but
class time consists of discussion and help with assignments. Students also
submit their assignments in class or via e-mail. Quizzes and exams (other than
those announced as proctored) are taken online via a form web page where
students click a "Submit" button and the results are emailed to the
instructor. There is limited feedback on assignments and exams. Correct
answers with some explanations are usually posted after deadlines have
elapsed, but individual requests for feedback must be done by personal email
or office visits. Netetiquette is expected during use of the community
bulletin board. Students are sometimes assigned a special security code to use
in identifying themselves, but often this is part of their social security
number.**

**The online lectures are more than notes. They are in e-book format and have
a common look and feel. They are often updated, so it does little good to
print them all out in advance and put them in a binder. It is also foolish to
try and print out all the content at the hyperlinks to external sites at the
bottom of each lecture. You'd be printing for days. I will try to announce
updates as they happen, but the preferred method for reading in this course is
online, taking advantage of all the embedded hyperlinks, Internet resources,
Javascript applets, and other interactive media that is typical of an online
course.  Please make a habit of hitting the Refresh or Reload icon on your web
browser to make sure you are viewing the latest version of a page at this
site, or set your browser settings to refresh automatically.   **

**Readings from the Lecture Notes will be assigned in blocks of roughly one
week's duration (this interval may vary from time to time), supplemented in
almost all cases with lecture notes and PowerPoint slide summaries that are
posted on the web.   Some of these supplements may (in the future) have audio
and video files attached for emphasis on certain points.  Students will be
expected to answer questions from reading assignments and to submit those
answers as a Microsoft Word document attached to an e-mail message with their
name on all assignments. Microsoft Works is not acceptable, and the only hope
is if the file is saved in text format. Wordperfect is also not preferred,
although the instructor does have Corel Suite 8.  Students can purchase the
latest Microsoft Office Suite from the school's IS dept for nominal cost (call
252-985-5000). **

**After approximately 4-5 units of instruction, there will be one or more
short quizzes that have to be completed within a five-day interval. A midterm
and final exam also occur at the usual times in the course.**

**Quizzes and exams are administered via the web, by completing a web-based
form.   The information entered into the form is sent electronically to the
instructor for grading, with the results posted on a grades page. There is
little to no feedback on quizzes, exams, and assignments, only grades. Most
quizzes and exams will not be proctored, but require entering the name and
security number for each student. You are on your honor that you, and only
you, are the one taking the course and taking the exams. Security numbers
assigned to individual students may change throughout the course. Only a small
number of answers can be looked up in the lectures because students will find
that, even with the help of sample exams which are also posted on the web,
online quizzes and exams are extremely difficult and require going beyond rote
memorization.  **

**Depending on the course, there are also writing assignments in the form of
short essays, research papers, or briefs of major court cases, all of which
will be completed and submitted electronically.  ** **Communication with the
instructor will be via e-mail, bulletin board, telephone, or by scheduled
appointments, where feasible.  Feedback on assignments, if requested, must
take place in person by appointment, and then only after the exam period has
elapsed for everyone.**

**Do not put off completing assignments until the last possible moment before
the deadline, as those deadlines are posted on the announcements page.   I
make every effort not to penalize students who fail to get assignments in on
time when it's not their fault, but it is difficult to find someone completely
blameless when they have demonstrated a pattern of turning in almost
everything late or at the last minute.  If there is some problem that develops
and keeps you from completing an assignment, leave a message via e-mail (which
is my preferred means of communication) or telephone me at my office to leave
a voicemail, and I will respond to you in the normal course of business. When
and if it becomes obvious that you cannot succeed in the course, I will
administratively drop you from enrollment as I will for missing too many
deadlines. Absences are tallied by how many assignments you miss. An "x" in
the grade column means there's time to turn something in; a "0" means too
late.**

**Always be sure to identify yourself in emails to the instructor and in all
attachments, especially if you are using a non-school email address. Don't use
nicknames on the bulletin board, but your full name. Try to send your messages
from one email account, and let me know what that account is. The school does
not service or assist non-edu accounts, but I will do my best to keep track of
them on the course listserv. Make sure you identify yourself by name on
everything you send electronically.**

**Understand that research may have to be done the old-fashioned way, in a
paper-based library. While it is extremely convenient (and often effective) to
do research from your home via the web, there are still many resources that
simply aren't available there.   If you are not able to get to the College
library, then you should become familiar with whatever library you are able to
use.  Whenever possible, the library that you use should be a college or
university library, as public libraries do not usually have the academic
journal collections or reference materials that you are likely to need.  A
superior court may also have to be located for you to use a law library. Keep
track of the assignments for a semester that are posted in advance on the
syllabus, and made up as we go along, posted online at the assignments page.
You can also contact the school's library (call 252-985-5350) and request a
password for NC Live which allows you access to a number of research materials
via the Internet.**

**Speaking of writing assignments:   most of them are not the type that can be
done in a few minutes, or call for the quick look-up of a few facts from
readings.  Most of them are intended to promote critical thinking on an issue,
and require research, additional reading, possibly some discussion, and
certainly some creative thought.  The bulletin board discussion web is
available for you to voice opinions and issues with the instructor and other
students, and you are encouraged to make as much use of it as possible.
Still, you should understand that statements in writing should be supported by
references, and that references should be cited specifically. Web-based as
well as print references are allowed.** **Unless you are unusually eloquent, a
writing assignment of about 300-500 words is usually appropriate, unless
otherwise indicated.**

**You should also take the time to insure that your work is free from spelling
and grammatical errors.   You should have access to high-end word processing
software, and it should not be too onerous to use the Spelling and Grammar
check features.**

**Course Requirements:**

**All types of quizzes and Exams count 50% of the final grade. All other
assignments make up the other 50%.**

**Quizzes are short 10-15 multiple choice questions that cover specific
reading assignments, and occur about once every 4 lectures. Midterms and
Finals count twice as heavily as quizzes, and occur at the middle and end of
the semester. There is usually a five day period when quizzes and exams are
online and available to take. Keep refreshing the announcements page, as it
will tell you when a quiz or exam is coming up.**

**Assignments are pieces of writing that are related to learning objectives in
this course. They involve critical or creative thinking, and often your doing
something outdoors, indoors, at work, at home, or with people you meet. You
may be asked to do something like go up to someone while you are shopping or
at work and ask them a series of questions to learn how Guttman-scale survey
items are delivered, for example. There is approximately one assignment for
each lecture, and they are to be found in each lecture, and summarized on the
assignments page.**

**  Attendance and Participation:**

**Students are expected to be mature enough to discipline themselves and to
know when they are having attendance problems. They are also expected to check
in by email after the course starts.   There is a week's deadline for all
course requirements, but not doing course requirements promptly results in
recording an absence point. These points are recorded on a grades page, and
accumulate if you are not participating in other ways. After a significant
number of absenteeism points, you will be contacted by the instructor for
counseling. Depending upon the results of this and/or your improvement, there
may or may not be a lessening of your final grade, usually no more than a half
or full letter grade, depending upon your circumstances. If you have signed up
for the course and are not participating regularly, you will be
administratively dropped.**

**Office Hours:**

**Please feel encouraged to stop by during office hours, and any other time at
your convenience. You'll note that the fastest way to contact me is
via[email](mailto:toconnor@ncwc.edu), and there are also extensive resources
for this course on the [web site](../default.htm). Please familiarize yourself
with the [navigation scheme](../navigation.htm).**

**Assignments:**

**Exams are typically multiple choice with the occasional subjective question
when necessary.   Written work may consist of interpretation of a table or
chart of figures. Although it is not required, it helps to have some
familiarity with statistics, as I will be making use of such information in an
easy-to-learn format.**

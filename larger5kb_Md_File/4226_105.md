  PLACEMENT  
 ACT composite of 26, ACT English of 31, SAT verbal of 650 (before 4/95) or
710 (after 4/95), permission of the Director of Composition or the Director of
Honors Program. As a consequence of these placement criteria, the goals of
English 105 incorporate those of both English 101 and 102; this course
therefore fulfills two general education written communication requirements.
Students who complete English 105 have satisfied the English 101- 102
requirement. | NOTICE ON INSTRUCTION MODIFICATION  
Students that have a disability or condition which may  
impair their ability to complete assignments or otherwise  
satisfy curse criteria are encourage to meet with the  
instructor to identify, discuss, and document any feasible instructional
modifications or accommodations. The student should notify the Instructor no
later that the end of the  
second week of the semester/term in which the course  
offered or not later than the end of the second week after  
such a disability or condition is diagnosed, whichever  
occurs earliest. The student may contact the Disabilities Resource Center for
information and auxiliary aid.

**PLAGIARISM**  
**PLAGIARISM WILL RESULT IN AN "F" FOR THE COURSE AND A LETTER DOCUMENTING THE
PLAGIARISM IN YOUR PERMANENT FILE. SEE THE STUDENT HANDBOOK (27-29). IF YOU
ARE CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT CONSTITUTES PLAGIARISM, SEE ME.** **COURSE
DESCRIPTION** This course introduces you to college writing. The way to become
a good writer is to read a good deal and to write a great deal. You will do
some reading for this class, but primarily you will write--a lot. You will be
introduced to some of the important genres of college writing--the summary,
the analysis, the proposal, the annotated bibliography, the research paper--
writing at least one each of these. In addition, we will work in class on: how
to take a personal response and turn it into a formal paper, how to edit, how
to respond to comments, how to read a paper assignment, how to take an essay
exam, how to do group work, etc.

The subject matter for much of the writing and research in this course is the
nineteenth century. Let me be clear: this is not a class in nineteenth-century
history or literature; it is a writing class. But what you will be writing
about are aspects of nineteenth-century America and Britain. |  **105 GENERAL
GOALS** This class fulfills two General Education Written Communication
requirements: students who successfully complete English105 have satisfied the
English 101  & 102 requirements. Written communication is the ability to
develop and express ideas, opinions, and information in appropriate written
forms. To fulfill this requirement, students will complete a substantial
amount of writing, including several texts that go through the writing
process. Students who satisfy this requirement will demonstrate that they are
able to do all of the following:

  * Understand and use writing processes, including invention, drafting, organizing, revising through multiple drafts, and editing;
  * Write clear and effective prose in several forms, demonstrating an awareness of audience and purpose;
  * Understand and use appropriate academic textual conventions of presentation, at sentence level and beyond;
  * Employ critical thinking processes, such as abstracting, synthesizing, and representing ideas, and developing complex structures for them;
  * Collect, select, and integrate material from a variety of sources into their writing, citing it appropriately.

**SERIAL READING**  
 We start by reading Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper," which
was originally published in _New England Magazine_ in 1892. The edition we
will be using provides a range of materials, giving a sense of the cultural,
political, medical,   issues surrounding this text. Looked at in this way,
"Yellow Wallpaper" introduces us not only to periodical reading in the
nineteenth century but also to the ways in which texts can open up potential
research topics.  
    
    
  ![](audley.jpg) | Throughout the rest of the semester, we will be reading
Mary Elizabeth Braddon's _Lady Audley's Secret_ (first published in _Robin
Goodfellow_ from July 6-September 28, 1861) serially. That is, we will be, to
some extent, recreating the experience of nineteenth-century readers as they
first encountered Braddon's wildly popular (and influential) story in separate
installments--although we will also talk about how and why our twentieth-
century responses might be different.   _Lady Audley's Secret_ may also give
you ideas for your research paper. Finally, I have to tell you that this book
is a great read.  
**WE WILL WORK ON THE BOOK IN INSTALLMENTS, FOLLOWING THE ORIGINAL SERIAL
PUBLICATION. THIS MEANS YOU ARE NOT TO READ AHEAD! IF YOU CANNOT HELP
YOURSELF, YOU MUST AT LEAST KEEP YOUR INFORMATION PRIVATE--DON'T TALK OR WRITE
ABOUT IT.**  
---|---  
  
 These readings will be the basis for your response papers (see below), as
well as other writing exercises. They will give the class a shared frame of
reference. The novel will introduce you to the nineteenth century, as it were:
customs, manners, beliefs, etc. We will use the readings as opportunities to
discuss voice, audience, rhetoric, and other aspects of writing that will be
important to your own written work in the course.

**RESPONSE PAPERS**  
 On Tuesdays (or if Tuesday is a holiday, Thursday), reading responses
(designated as **RP** on the syllabus) are due. These are one page (minimum)
responses to your assigned weekly reading. Responses should be typed and
readable, but need not be meticulously proofread. They can deal with any
aspect of the reading and/or your response to it. They will be graded --,
,    \+ Occasionally, you will be asked to respond to a specific question in
these writings.

**RESOURCES IN EKSTROM LIBRARY**

Ekstrom has a pretty extensive collection of nineteenth-century journals--
print copies, microfilms, and microfiche. These are all listed on Minerva. If
you want to browse, you can go to the shelves: figure out the call numbers
that correspond to your area of interest (the reference librarian can help you
with this) and just walk up and down the appropriate aisle in the stacks. Or
go look at  the microfilm set, _American Periodicals Series_ (Film 31 AP 55,
56, 57). Note that this series is now also available online (see **Web
Resources** below). For the latter, look first at the Guide in Media: Z 6951.
H65 (second floor); it lists periodicals both alphabetically and by subject--
easy to browse.

**Possible titles (a highly selective list--there are many more):**  
_Godey's Ladies Book_ (fashion, literature, culture, women's interests)  
_Ladies Repository_ ("women's interests")  
_North American Review_ (politics and culture)  
_Harper's, Putnam's, Scribner's, The Century, The Atlantic_ (literature and
culture)  
_DeBow's, Southern Literary Messenger_ (Southern issues, among other things)  
_Catholic World, The Christian Examiner_ (religious issues, among other
things)  
_Juvenile Miscellany, The Slave's Friend_ (aimed at children)  
_McClure's, Munsey's_ (mass-market, general interest)  
_The North Star or Frederick Douglass's Paper_ (more of a newspaper, on
microfilm)  
_The Anglo-African Magazine_ (literature and culture, African-American
perspectives)

There are two good indexes of nineteenth-century journals: _Poole's_ and the
_Wellesley_. _Poole's Index to Peiodical Literature, 1802-1906_ (REF A13.P7)
is an index to subjects, not writers, unless the writer is treated as a
subject. There is also a cumulative author index, REF A13.W3. _Wellesley Index
to Victorian Periodicals, 1824-1900 (REF A13.W45, vol.1-5)_ indexes 45
Victorian periodicals. It is available on CD-Rom which, of course, makes
searching easier. If you are working on the end of the century, there is also
_Nineteenth Century Reader''s Guide to Periodical Literature, 1890-99_ (REF
A13.R496, vol.1-2, pt.1-2. Only some of the materials listed in these indexes
will be available in Ekstrom. The rest would need to be ordered Interlibrary
Loan (ILL)--orders can be placed at the first-floor circulation desk.

One thing to remember is that, if you are working on a specific topic, there
may be a bibliography for that topic (for example, _Crime in Victorian
Britain,_ an annotated Bibliography from nineteenth-century British magazines
(HV 6943.P34). Check Minerva and consult with the Reference Librarian.

_Nineteenth-Century Literary Criticism (NCLC)_ , located in Reference, is a
multivolume resource that collects and comments on  nineteenth-century reviews
and criticism. There are author entries, as well as topics volumes.

_Critical Heritage_ books collect 19th- and 20th-century reviews and
criticisms on a given authors. The more canonical an author, the more likely
he (I use the pronoun advisedly) is to have a _CH_ book. Located in the stacks
with the author's works.

**ON RESERVE**  
I've put a few general reference books on reserve in Ekstrom. These include
chapters on such topics as "Education," "Prostitution," "Popular
Entertainments," etc. Use them as ways to begin thinking about topics and as
resources for nineteenth-century sources (that is, look at their notes,
bibliographies, "suggested readings," etc.--what sources did these scholars
use that you can now turn to?).

[Victorian Studies Web](http://landow.stg.brown.edu/victorian/victov.html).
George Landow, one of the foremost authorities on hypertext, created this rich
site. See also the many links at the [Victoria Research
Web](http://www.indiana.edu/~victoria/), which contains a wealth of
information. Be sure to explore under "Libraries"  
for the section on "Periodicals." Look too at "Other Victorian Resources."

[Washington State University American Studies Program's Web
Projects](http://www.wsu.edu/~amerstu/projects.html) are very useful. See
especially the [19th Century Historical, Literary, & Cultural Studies
](http://www.wsu.edu/~amerstu/19th/19th.html)site. Listings and links to
numerous periodicals on the web (full runs as well as single issues).

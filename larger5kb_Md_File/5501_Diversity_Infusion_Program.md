_Description of Supplemental Material and How Integrated in Course:_

I used Blackboard as a tool to help infuse the class. It was the perfect
supplement to tie all the material together. I was able to upload handouts and
give extra reading assignments by connecting the students to the internet.
This also allowed students easy access to online information to help in their
research about the various diversity topics discussed in class. I also invited
several guest speakers to class and showed two movies.

_Special Assignments and Activities:_

The following is a complete list of journals for this class. Write a minimum
of one paragraph (5 sentences) responding to each writing prompt. Journal
writing is a prewriting activity, much like freewriting, and is done only as a
way to gather ideas. Spelling and punctuation aren't part of the grading
process, however, if others have difficulty reading your responses in Bulletin
Board, you risk not having your point understood. And worse, others may not
take your responses seriously. Journals are graded three times during the
semester as part of your notebook grade. Bulletin Board journals need to be
completed before we move on to the next unit. Keep this in mind.

We use the words "culture" and "cultural" quite freely and satisfactorily in
everyday conversation. But suppose we try to be a bit more rigorous in

explain what culture is.

Suggestion: Start with a large general dictionary, and at some stage check the
Oxford English Dictionary.

Sowell, Thomas. Ethnic America: A history . Basic Books, 1981.

Assignment #7

Ethnic Minority Presentations

Assignment #9

Overview:  
Students are to research a major world religion and present a report about
that religion and its place in its home culture and in the world. Students
will prepareboth a written and an oral report on the religion they have
selected. The written report should be 1-2 pages (typed), and the oral report
should be 2-3 minutes long.

Objectives: In this activity, students will:

  1. Research a major World Religion
  2. Present their information in a written and oral form 

Materials:  
This activity requires the following resources:  
Computers with access to the Internet or CD-ROM reference resources  
Access to other reference materials such as encyclopedias or books about
religion

Procedure:  
Written reports should include:  
The major beliefs of that religion  
How the religion influences the lives of its followers (what might adherents
do differently than nonbelievers?)  
Founder(s)  
Leader(s)  
Holy day(s) (holidays and days of the week)  
Holy cities  
Holy book(s)  
Places of worship  
Dietary laws  
Countries that this religion is practiced in (along with the percentage of the
population that adheres to the religion)  
Guiding set of precepts, rules, or principles (commandments, pillars, etc.)  
Why the religion should be considered a major world religion  
Bibliography

For the oral reports, students should focus on knowing their material well
enough that they do not need to read directly from a paper or note card. They
should also avoid memorizing what they have to say. Students should be
encouraged to use note cards; they should practice using them as an aid, not
as a crutch.

Students are also encouraged to bring visual aids to illustrate their
presentations. Extra Credit and special time extensions can be given for
student presentations that go beyond just presenting "the facts." (All time
extensions must be preapproved at least a week in advance, however.)

type it before handing it in.

Assignment #16

Locating Books: Paraphrase  
The card catalogue should give you strong access to our collection if you use
the vocabulary you developed in the previous pre-research assignment
creatively in the subject, key word, and even author fields. Find two (2)
books that relate to your topic. Be creative; the entire book may not relate,
but you may find material within the book that will. Titles can deceive.
Always look at the full record for a book, or get the book and browse the
table of contents and the index for your specific interest.  
Record the bibliography information for both books.(use bib cards) Do not
check out the books, for other students will then not have access to the same
information.  
Xerox 3-4 pages of a chapter from one book. Paraphrase a paragraph from these
pages. (use note cards)  
Submit bib cards, Xeroxed pages, note cards. (20 points)

Assignment #17

Locating Periodicals: Summaries  
Go to the EBSCO, Infotrac or any other database in the computer. Enter one or
more of the subject words you have. This should get you a huge number of
citations. Narrow that number by combining the first search with one or more
of the topic words you have on your list. You can also use the key words and
argument words you wrote down. Play around with these in combinations. When
you have a reasonable number of citations, look them over. If you find new key
words or topics of interest or arguments, fine, follow your interest to where
it leads you.  
Locate three periodical articles. At least one periodical must be professional
and at least one must be popular.  
Record the bibliography information for all three. (use bib cards)  
Xerox ONE full text article. Summarize the article into a paragraph. (use note
cards)  
Submit the bib cards, Xeroxed full text article, note cards. (20 points)

Assignment #18

Locating Internet Sources: Summaries  
Doing research on the Internet brings new opportunities --and new challenges.
The internet is democratic, global, up-to-the-minute, interactive, and free.
You can use many different programs to search for information. Selecting the
most efficient search tool for a particular topic usually means choosing
between two kinds of tools: those providing subject directories and those
listing text indexes. Subject directories are menus of topics and subtopics;
text indexes let you scan documents for specific terms.  
Go to External Links for easy access to the different search engines. Locate
two websites with information about your topic.

Record the bibliography information. (Use bib cards)  
Print out one page of info from either site. Summarize the information. (Use
note cards)  
Submit: bib cards, print out of info, note cards. (20 points)

Assignment #19

this assignment.

Assignment #20

_Difficulties and Successes I've Had:_

I had a difficult time teaching students the skills they needed to manage the
technology used in the class, but as far as the content goes, most of it went
well. I would recommend infusing the class first and then adding in the use of
the internet and Blackboard. The only difficulty I had was during the unit on
culture. Most of the focus was on learning about the traditionally subjugated
cultures of the US and learning to accepted these cultures that are different
than "ours." This approach would have worked well if I had classes with a
predominantly white student body, but that is not the case at South Mountain.
I discovered that we needed to focus a bit more on "White culture," since at
South that culture is the minority culture.

I didn't ask students about the hours spent doing the assignments because the
whole class was designed around the diversity infusion process. So everything
they did related to diversity. I didn't ask students if the assignments were
educational because all of the assignments met the competencies outlined for
the course. When asked if the class was enjoyable, students responded that
they liked working with current events instead of boring outdated content.
They didn't enjoy all the essays I made them write, but they liked that they
could write about something they knew about: themselves and how they relate to
the different diversity issues. Students indicated that they liked watching
movies (of course), they like the guest speakers, and they enjoyed being able
to communicate with each other through the Discussion Board on Blackboard.

Many students indicated early on that they disliked having so much to do on
Blackboard and other comments about the design of the class, but nothing
specific to the diversity content added to the class. When asked what they
learn from completing this class, many didn't know what to say since the
class, writing essays, and the diversity issues were infused. So many students
said they learned to write good essays. I learned that I should ask better
questions next time. Many students indicated that the last unit we studied,
alternative lifestyles, did change or modify how they perceived others. Many
were surprised that the guest speaker, a lesbian, was in fact a lesbian. "She
didn't look like a lesbian," they proclaimed. They said that the presentation
and the discussion the following class period was very eye opening. A
summation of that discussion: They realized that some people (not them of
course) might treat the guest differently if they knew she was a lesbian or
even think bad thoughts about her, but if they didn't know, they would treat
her as the respectable individual that she is. The factor that would determine
how we treat someone doesn't in fact change who that person is, so why do we
judge and change the way we would treat that person? What an agreeable bunch.
They all said they wouldn't do that in the future. But I don't think we can
judge comments made in class on or a survey with much validity. I think many
students just tell you what they think you want to hear. I don't say that to
take away from the effectiveness of my class, but as a reality check. We can
win them all!

I didn't ask if they felt the assignments were valuable. When I asked about
recommended changes, no answers pertained to the diversity content of the
class. Most recommended continuing the class in its present state.

to class prepared and to complete assignments on time and in an organized
fashion.

### Glossary

**SII** \--Strength, Improvement, Insight.

During every team activity, the Reflector not only participates in the
activity, but also observes the team process, noticing how the team interacts
and noting in writing the strengths, improvements needed, and insights. An SII
report may be given to the team by the Reflector at any point during the
activity to help the team process along. A verbal SII report is given to the
entire class by the Reflector at the end of the activity.  
  
  
**Strength** \--what your team did well and why it was a strength.  
**Improvement** \--an aspect of the team process that needs to be improved and
how this improvement could be accomplished.  
**Insight** \--something you the Reflector realized as a result of observing
your team that would be helpful for others to know.  
**Performance** \--the best job you can do at a given time

  
  
### Methodology for an Activity

1\. Team members read entire activity.  
2\. Team Captain assesses team's understanding of what will be done during the

mind:  
  
  * Team Recorder participates and writes team responses to Questions for Critical Thinking 
  * Team Spokesperson participates and is prepared to speak for the team as needed 
  * Team Reflector participates and prepares a written and verbal SII of the team dynamics 
  * Team Captain participates and assures the activity is completed on time

#### Catalog Description for Cell Biology 308 (Spring 1999)

#### 308 Cell Biology (3 SH): A study of the cell as a biological unit.
Analysis of ultrastructure, macromolecular organization and function of cell
components in plants and animals is emphasized. Lecture only. Prerequisites:
Principles of Biology 241, 242 and Organic Chemistry 340 or Organic Chemistry
350. Offered yearly.

#### Course Description for Cell Biology 308 (Spring 1999)

#### This course is intended to help the student to develop an understanding
of the cell as the basic biological unit. Emphasis is placed on
ultrastructure, organization and function of cellular organelles, and the
regulation of selected cell activities. Many other topics in cell biology will
be addressed in subsequent courses including Genetics, Molecular Biology,
Developmental Biology and Biochemistry. The prerequisites for Cell Biology 308
are Principles of Biology 241 and 242 and either Organic Chemistry 340 or
Organic Chemistry 350. The course will be taught with the assumption that the
student is fully responsible for the content of these four courses.

#### Instructor's Expectations and Policies

#### Adequate student preparation for the lecture is expected. Details
discussed in the lectures can not be fully appreciated or remembered if a
student has not first read and studied the appropriate topic in the text.
Assessments of student's preparation for class may be made through the use of
unannounced quizzes. Attendance at lectures is expected. Quizzes may be given
and normally there will be no make-up quizzes or exams. Under truly unusual
circumstances (serious illness or personal emergencies which have been excused
by the VP for Student Affairs or which can be verified by other means), course
requirements may be satisfied in other ways.

#### Course Requirements

#### To receive credit for this course, students will need to demonstrate
mastery of the course content by earning the appropriate number of points on
exams, quizzes and a term paper as detailed under grading policy

#### Grade Policy for Cell Biology 308 (Spring 1999)

#### Grades in this class will be determined on a non-competitive basis. It is
possible for every student to earn an "A" grade.

The instructor will add the scores earned on the best four (4) of the five (5)
hourly exams (50 x 4 = 200 possible points), the score earned on the
comprehensive final exam (100 points), all of the quiz/problem set scores
except the lowest one (up to 50 points) and a [term
paper](../TermPapr/termpapr.htm) worth a total of 50 points. Grades will be
determined by evaluation of the distribution of total points. Because only the
best four of the five hourly exams will be counted and because the lowest
quiz/problem set score is thrown out, there will be no makeup exams or quizzes
in this class. All students must take the comprehensive final exam to
successfully complete this class. There will be no makeup for the
comprehensive final exam. The final exam will be given as scheduled by
official Winona State University policy. The instructor reserves the right to
raise or lower the points earned by any student up to a maximum of 25 points
based on the instructors subjective evaluation of the student's class
participation, attendence, preparation and/or effort.

  * Students earning 90% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "A". 
  * Students earning 80% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "B". 
  * Students earning 70% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "C". 
  * Students earning 60% or more of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "D". 
  * Students earning less than 60% of the points earned by the top student in the class will receive the grade of "F".

 maintaining this very diverse and well administered list of resources on Latin
 America. There are many Caribbean resources included.
 
CaribSeek -At this writing, the most
comprehensive search engine located in the Caribbean is CaribSeek. Although some
categories at CaribSeek are not yet linked to sites, the framework is there to
build a comprehensive system as sites are activated or existing sites make
links.

The United Kingdom (U.K.)

In general, the U.K. has a highly decentralized system of libraries.
Traditionally, faculties or even individual professors have held valuable
collections in their schools, institutes or personal offices. These collections
are gradually being united in cyberspace through several, recent, electronic, library
initiatives. 

The British Library has an extensive collection on the Caribbean that is
currently found in their card catalogue and in
the Hispanic/Latin
American Collection. The Caribbean is not identified as a separate
collection. The British Library has the largest collection on Latin America in
the United Kingdom, containing material on all humanities and social science
topics and periods and on all the countries of Latin America and the English and
Spanish-speaking Caribbean. NOTE: The British Library online catalogue will change
in 2001 but they have promised that Internet access will be uninterrupted.

COPAC, a recently merged catalogue
of nineteen major University Libraries throughout the UK, is an important, centralized
source (COPAC is a trademark of the Victoria University of Manchester).

The Institute for Commonwealth Studies Library, which is part of the School
of Advanced Studies at The University of London, has two interesting sites: The Commonwealth
Caribbean and Central America Archives and the CASBAH Project. The chief aim of the CASBAH Project is to identify and map
national research resources for Caribbean studies and the history of Black and
Asian people in Britain.

The main library at The
University of London  (UL) also contains a helpful list of
collections within the University's decentralized special collections. Several
of these libraries have Caribbean components. Additionally, UL contains an
excellent page
leading to Latin American and
Caribbean Resources Outside of The University of London. Other links on that
page will lead you to Resources in London (courtesy of the Institute of Latin
American Studies at UL) and Resources Worldwide (via LANIC).

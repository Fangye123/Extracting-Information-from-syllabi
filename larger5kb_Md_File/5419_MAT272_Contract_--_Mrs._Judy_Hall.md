**COURSE DESCRIPTION:** This discrete mathematics course is an introduction to
abstract mathematical structures, with special emphasis on theories and
methods relevant to computer science.   General areas of emphasis include:
mathematical reasoning, combinatorial analysis, discrete structures,
applications, and algorithmic thinking, introduction to formal systems and
techniques of proofs, combinatorial versus relational structures, directed and
undirected graphs; Boolean algebra; abstract languages and machines.  Specific
topics will come from the following list: integer arithmetic in different
bases, logic (propositions and truth tables), set theory, functions,
algorithms, matrices, mathematical reasoning, mathematical induction,
recursion, counting techniques (permutations and combinations), recurrence
relations, relations, graph theory, trees, boolean algebra, languages and
grammar, and state transition diagrams.  Students are required to use
calculators in the course.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**[Behavioral (learning) objectives](obj272.htm) are the
items/concepts that you are expected to know to satisfactorily complete this
course. They are the items on which you will be tested. It is anticipated that
**students will require a minimum of   6 hours per week outside of class
(homework and study time)** to meet the behavioral objectives for this course.

**REQUIRED COURSE TEXTBOOK:** The required textbook for this course is **_A
First Course in Discrete Mathematics_** , by John C. Molluzzo and Fred
Buckley, Waveland Press Inc, 1997.

**COURSE SUPPLIES:** Please bring the textbook, writing implements, paper,
your calculator, your brain, and your sense of humor to every class.

**COOPERATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT** :

* Many students find it is easier to learn the material to be covered on an exam by working in a small group. You may assign yourselves to a **no-larger-than-4-person group** and choose a group leader. The group leader should notify me via e-mail of the first/last names and preferred e-mail addresses of group members; group leaders have until January 30th,2000 to take this first group action. It is possible that group membership may change during the semester, and group leaders should notify me via e-mail as to actual group membership on the Monday before a scheduled exam.
* On the other hand, some students hate to work in groups, so you will also have the opportunity to decide if you wish to work alone (as an " **Independent Contractor** " or "IC"). Independent contractors should notify me of their decision to work alone via e-mail prior to January 30th, 2000. It would be helpful if independent contractors would notify me of their choice to continue as an independent contractor via e-mail, on the Monday before a scheduled exam.
* **Exam "GROUP BONUS"** : The group that has the highest average on the first, second, and third exams will receive a bonus of 10 points, which will be added to each group member's overall point total. Group members who miss an exam will hurt their group's average by submitting a score of 0.  There will be no group bonus points given on the fourth exam. Independent contractors are not eligible for the exam "group bonus" points. Groups with less than 3 members will not be eligible for the exam "group bonus" points.
* **Group leaders** will be responsible for their group's performance, and hence will grade the group members' participation in the group case study on a scale of 1-100 %. Group leaders (but NOT independent contractors) will earn an extra 20 points if their group case study (see below) is completed in an acceptable fashion.

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS**

**HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENTS** :  For each hour spent in class, the student is
expected to spend two hours out of class doing homework, that is, 6 hours of
homework and studying per week. [Homework problems are assigned for each class
lecture](homework272.htm) topic as specified on the tentative schedule sheet.
Homework will NOT be graded, except in the rather unlikely case that I choose
to collect it and count it as extra credit. Homework answers, many of which
are available on the internet, will be reviewed if requested.  Students may
work together on homework assignments, helping each other master the required
competencies, since MASTERY of the material by each student is what is
important. Students should make every attempt to complete homework assignments
in a timely fashion; students are cautioned not to procrastinate.  


**EXAMS** :  There will be four 100-point in-class, closed-book exams, given
on the dates indicated on the [tentative schedule](sched272.htm).  The student
missing an exam may take a 100-point in-class, closed-book COMPREHENSIVE MAKE-
UP EXAM which will be administered during my office hours (7:30-9:00am) on the
Monday of the last week of the semester; students must sign up for this exam
at leas one week in advanve. **EXAM "GROUP" BONUS:** The group (see
"Cooperative Learning Environment") or individual that has the highest average
on exams 1, 2 and 3 will receive a bonus of +10 points, and these bonus points
will be added to each group member's overall grade total.  


**GROUP "CASE STUDY" PROBLEM SOLVING PROJECT / CLASS PRESENTATION:**  
The textbook contains numerous Case Studies relating discrete math to specific
computer science topics, each of which generally includes some history or
background information, some theory, some examples, and some exercises.  Each
group and each independent contractor will be "assigned" a textbook case study
project that will build on work done in lecture. The case study project
assignment will take place in a simple fashion: choice will be allowed, with
the exception that the case studies are chosen on a first-choice basis, so
that there will be no duplication of case-study projects. For those
groups/IC's with no preference, an un-chosen case study project will be "drawn
from a hat" by the instructor during an office hour and assigned.

A list of the **possible Case Study problems** is shown below: Case Study 1A:
Binary Numbers  
Case Study 1B: Floating Point Numbers  
Case Study 1C: Floating Point Arithmetic  
Case Study 1D: Memory Addressing and Data Encoding  
Case Study 2A: Searching and Sorting  
Case Study 3A: Correctness of Algorithms  
Case Study 3B: Introduction to Algorithm Analysis  
Case Study 4A: Random Numbers and Simulation  
Case Study 5A: Computer Functions  
Case Study 5B: Algorithm Analysis: Order of Magnitude  
Case Study 5C: Cryptography  
Case Study 6A: Stacks, Queues, and Deques  
Case Study 6B: Implementation and Comparison of Sorting Algorithms  
Case Study 7A: Switching Theory  
Case Study 8A: Heap Sort  
Case Study 8B: The Critical Path Method (CPM)  
---  
  
Each group and each independent contractor will be responsible for:

* (1) preparing and giving a 10-15 minute class presentation on that material during the last two weeks of the semester (schedule to be developed at a later date), and
* (2) preparing and distributing handouts of the solutions to the exercises associated with that Case Study.
  
The Case Study Project (Presentation & Solutions Handout) will be graded by me
on a scale of 100 points.  


* Group leaders earn "my grade + 20" points (max grade=120)
* IC's earn "my grade" points (max grade=100)
* Group Members earn "my grade * group leader % grade" points (max grade=100).

**GRADE ENHANCEMENT OPTIONS**

  

**#1 OPTIONAL INTERNET SEARCH EXERCISES : **The student will provide five (5)
internet sites that deal with actually learning/understanding a [specific
learning objective](obj272.htm) covered in class or which is covered in the
textbook. Each internet site will be discussed on a [form to be provided by
the instructor](MAT272InternetSitesEvaluationForm.htm) that the student should
print from the internet (make sure -- under File|Page Setup -- that the
left/right, top/bottom margins are set at 0.5" in your browser).

The submitted packet should include:  
[a cover page provided by the
instructor](MAT272InternetSitesPacketCoverPage.htm) (which should also be
printed by the student from the internet with the 0.5" margin settings), and
for each of the 5 internet sites:

* a printout of the web page (showing the URL) and
* the completed form which comments on the usefulness of the site to a discrete math student. The comments should include information about the site, page title, page URL, page summary, date page was last updated, language of the page and considerable commentary on the page content.

  
**Submission of the correctly completed Internet site cover page and site
description forms for a specific discrete math learning objective can add 10
points to a test grade.**

But there are a few catches (aren't there always?), and these are the
following:

* (1) only the FIRST person submitting URLs for a specific learning objective can earn extra credit for that learning objective, so that there will be no duplication of learning objective extra credit. I will keep a record of the learning objectives for which internet search extra credit has been submitted (henceforth called "used"), and notify the class via the discrete-math mailing list. So, though the due date for this optional internet search work will be the Monday of the last week of the semester, the earlier you submit your work, the better your chances are of submitting an internet search for an "un-used" learning objective.
* (2) you may submit AT MOST an extra credit packet for 6 learning objectives, and each must come from a different category below:
  


* Number Systems and Integer Arithmetic 
* Sets and Logic 
* Combinatorics and Probability 
* Relations and Functions 
* Graph Theory 
* Boolean Algebra   
---  
  
**#2 OPTIONAL INTERNET WEB PAGE CREATION EXERCISE** : A **group** or an
independent contractor or an individual may design, develop, and implement a
web page entitled:   " ** _Learning Discrete Math -- A Reference Guide for
College Students"_** making use of neat graphics and the Discrete Math URLs
identified by classmates in #1 above (provided by me or by your classmates).
This web page must reside on either of the live web servers _duncan.cup.edu_
or _ryker.aet.cup.edu_   or _sighsy.cup.edu  _ and should contain at least 30
links (at least 5 in each of the 6 categories). **Submission of the final URL
and a printout of the completed web page can add 40 points to a test grade (IF
the web page is well organized, IF it contains neat and relevant graphics, IF
I like it, and IF the web page contains no malfunctioning links when I test
it).** The due date for this optional internet web page development work will
be the Monday of the last week of the semester.  


**#3 OPTIONAL PROGRAMMING PROJECTS** : The instructor may assign optional
programming projects relevant to the current lecture topic. Programming
project specification and recommended programming language, point value, and
due date would be either announced in class or posted to the discrete-math
class mailing list.

**COURSE GRADING SCHEME**

  

**RESULTS:** All grading done in this course will be based on RESULTS, and NOT
on effort. Though an extensive amount of effort is required on the part of the
student, if the effort put forth does not produce results, then for the
purpose of this course, the effort has been spent in vain.  


**FINAL GRADES:** Final grades will be determined from the following scale.

**Point Values for Required Activities**  
           4 Exams @ 100 points  = 400 points   
                                      Case Study  = 100 points   
                ANY EXTRA CREDIT or BONUS POINTS

**                                 MAXIMUM Total = 500 points**

|  **Final Grade Determination**  
**450** -    500 points --- A  
**400** - < 450 points --- B  
**350** - < 400 points --- C  
**300** - < 350 points --- D  
000 -< 300 points --- F  
---|---  
  
**GRADES to DATE:** On class days when graded items are returned for
discussion, students will be informed of their individual grade-to-date. This
will provide the student with the information necessary to make course
withdrawal decisions in a timely fashion (see W/WP/WF). Students absent from
class should make timely arrangements to see the instructor to review their
points earned and grade-to-date.  


**BORDERLINE FINAL GRADES:** Borderline grade cases will be determined
entirely at the discretion of the instructor. Students who whine at the
instructor when discussing grades guarantee limited consideration of a
borderline case.  


**INCOMPLETE:** An "I" grade (incomplete) will be given ONLY in the case of
extenuating circumstances (serious illness of student or death in immediate
family) and only if the course work completed to date is satisfactory (70% or
better). Students who whine at the instructor and expect/ demand an I grade
guarantee limited consideration of their case.  


**W/WP/WF:** Withdrawal from a course and grade-to-date go hand in hand.
Students can withdraw with a W grade during the first 6 weeks of the semester,
regardless of percentage grade or corresponding letter grade. However, during
weeks 6-12, withdrawing students receive either a WP if the percentage grade
to date is 70% or better (letter grade of A,B,C) or a WF if the percentage
grade to date is below 70% (letter grade of D,F). Because students cannot for
any reason withdraw after the end of Week 12, attention should be paid to the
methods described earlier for improvement of grades; students should not just
disappear from the instructor's sight.  


**CHEATING or ACADEMIC DISHONESTY:** Any student discovered committing an act
of academic dishonesty will receive the grade of F for the course. Academic
dishonesty shall include, but not be limited to:  
  **Cheating on Exams  **  
\--Copying exam answers from another student.  
\--Bringing written notes to class.  
\--Asking someone for the answers to test questions.  
\--Stealing or having in one's possession without permission, any tests,
notes, materials or property belonging to or generating from faculty, staff or
students.  
---  
**Aiding another student committing an act of academic dishonesty**  
\--Willfully offering to a student, answers or information related to tests or
examinations  
\--Doing another student's assignments.  
\--Taking a test  for another person.

**GENERAL COURSE NOTES**

**SCHEDULE:** The student is responsible for keeping aware of any changes made
by the instructor to the [distributed tentative schedule](sched272.htm).  


**ATTENDANCE:**

* (1) Students are expected to attend all scheduled classes; a record of attendance will be kept by the instructor. The student will be expected to sign a sheet during each class period indicating his/her presence.
* (2) No distinction between excused and un-excused absences (except in prolonged doctor-verified health situations when an Incomplete grade might be justified); the amount of work to be made up as a result of an excused absence versus an un-excused absence is identical.
* (3) No points will be deducted from the final totals for non-attendance; the student is considered to be an adult capable of making his/her own decisions about class attendance.
* (4) Students missing a class where handouts were provided are responsible for obtaining copies of these handouts from the instructor.
  




**RETURN POLICY for SUBMITTED PAPERS:** Any papers submitted for grading (be
they homework assignments, exams printouts, or quizzes) will NOT NECESSARILY
be returned to the student to keep in his possession. They will be returned to
the student and discussed in class, but must then (at the instructor's
discretion) be returned to the INSTRUCTOR'S POSSESSION. Students who are
absent from class on the day graded papers are returned for student perusal
should see the instructor during office hours (or by appointment) to review
graded papers.  


**STUDENT RIGHTS and RESPONSIBILITIES:**  
The handout entitled **"[Student Rights and Responsibilities](rights.htm)"**
has been compiled from discussions with many faculty members at many
institutions. The document represents the thoughts and opinions of me
personally; it is NOT to be considered a document which represents a published
policy statement issued by the administration of California University.
**Student rights** , in my opinion, comprise those things which are due to any
student by moral principles; correspondingly, student responsibilities, in my
opinion, represent the particular moral burdens or obligations owed on the
part of the student. It is important to me that students in my classes clearly
understand my feelings on this matter, and thus the document specifically
identifies what I believe are the rights and corresponding responsibilities of
all students.  


**ACCOMMODATIONS for STUDENTS with DISABILITIES**  


* **LEARNING DISABILITIES:** Students with learning disabilities work through the [CARE](http://www.itech.cup.edu/~csc201/care/care.htm) Project Office (office location: EDU 110, phone: 938-5781). The accommodation request form should be completed and submitted to the professor to acknowledge the accommodation arrangements. Faculty may contact the CARE Project Office to confirm that the accommodation has been approved based on the student's documentation and that the arrangements are appropriate.
  


* **ALL OTHER DISABILITIES:** Students requiring special considerations must get in touch with the Office of Services for Students with Disabilities (office location: Room 114 Clyde Hall, phone: 938-4012). The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities will notify the instructor in writing of the accommodations you need in compliance with 504/ADA.

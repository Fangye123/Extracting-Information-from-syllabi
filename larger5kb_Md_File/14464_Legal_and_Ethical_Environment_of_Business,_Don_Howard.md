**Attendance and Participation:**

The willingness to share relevant experiences during scheduled class sessions
will enrich the lecture and materials. Attendance is required, and
participation is encouraged and expected. Each student is expected to attend
class regularly, to arrive on time, and to remain until class is dismissed.
Tardiness and leaving class early are disruptive for other students and the
faculty and are behaviors that are not acceptable in a business setting.
Students who do not arrive promptly or leave early may be noted as absent.

Together, **attendance and participation will constitute 7.5% of the final
grade**. However, _five or more absences may result in a failing grade_. An
absence is defined as not attending a scheduled class session, leaving a
scheduled class session before it is officially dismissed and/or arriving to
class more than 15 minutes late.

**Testing Format:**

**Every student is required to take four exams**. Exams will generally consist
of multiple choice, short answer and essay questions.

  
**Academic Dishonesty and Classroom Behavior:**

_**Academic Dishonesty**_

The instructor will **strictly** follow the Augusta State University's
policies and procedures as outlined in the Jaguar Student Handbook and the
Augusta State University General Catalog (2001) section on _**Academic
Honesty.**_

Unethical behavior of students in any form is not acceptable. **Academic
dishonesty** \- cheating on exams, plagiarism of the work of others,
unapproved collaboration on graded work, and the like - **will not be
tolerated and will be dealt with immediately and with clear consequences**.
Depending on the nature of the problem, a student who is guilty of any such
violation may be withdrawn from the course with a grade of WF ( counted as an
F in the GPA ), given a grade of zero on the assignment, given a grade of F in
the course, or otherwise penalized.

**Other Distracting Behavior**

The classroom should be considered a place of business - academic business.
Distracting behavior such as uninvited casual talk among students, use of
cellular phones and beepers, eating snacks, drinking beverages, sleeping, or
inappropriate behavior toward fellow students or faculty will not be tolerated
any more than they would be in a business setting. Faculty have the right and
the responsibility to maintain a classroom free of such distractions. Students
who persist in such behavior may be asked to leave the class and may be
counted absent for the session. Persistent disruptive behavior may affect the
student's participation grade or result in withdrawing the student from the
course.

**Individual Class Presentation:**

Your presentation topic should be relevant to the legal, ethical and
regulatory environment of business. You should select your topic as soon as
possible and present it to me for approval. No two students may select the
same topic, **so topic approval will be on a first come first served basis**.
The topic will be presented to the class with strict adherence to the ten to
fifteen minute time limit for each presentation. Each student should
immediately begin to review the book and other business periodicals as sources
for ideas. **Topics will be approved beginning with the second class
meeting**. Dates for presentations will be provided to each member of the
class as their topic is approved. This is to be a presentation, not the
reading of a report. **Photocopies of sources should be provided to the
instructor along with an outline**. Each presentation will be evaluated by the
instructor using the following criteria: **1) Presentation** (was the
presentation relevant to our course?, was it interesting or boring?, was it a
quality presentation or was it read?) **2) Research** (what was the level of
research?, was there evidence of outside research?) **3) Visual Aids** (were
the visuals aids appropriate and helpful to the presentation?) **4) Overall
Effectiveness** (were there good responses to questions?, was it completed
within the time limitations?). **Presentations will begin the 1/18/01 class
meeting and will constitute 7.5% of the course grade**.

**Court Visit and Write-up:**

The class will visit two area courts (state and federal court) while in
session. The specific court and time of the visit will be determined by the
1/16/01 class meeting after consultation with the class. Each visit will last
for several hours and may conclude with an interview with the presiding judge.
Each student will be required to write a 3 to 5 page typed paper with
appropriate references on the visit. Your paper should reflect your experience
in the court room as well as the interview with the judge. The visits and
write-up will constitute 5% of your grade.

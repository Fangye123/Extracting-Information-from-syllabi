### Purpose



We will be learning about preserving text, images, data, sound, and other
genres of information using digital technologies for preservation and access.
The course will cover digitization of analog materials as part of a
preservation program, as well as methods for preserving "born-digital"
materials.   Particular topics to be explored in depth include:   selection
for preservation, copyright issues, digital longevity, formats and strategies
for preservation, maintaining authenticity of materials, and disaster
recovery.



__

### Course Requirements

  *       Mandatory class attendance

  *       Participation in class discussion (20% of final grade).   Please come to class prepared to discuss the readings; each week, 2-3 students will be asked to lead discussion on the required readings for that week.

  *       Timely completion of all assignments ( _a late assignment will be marked down 1/2 grade for each day it is turned in past the due date, unless prior arrangements have been made with the instructor_ ). 



### Assignments



1.  [ Benchmarking assignment](http://www.pitt.edu/%7Ekgracy/benchmarking_instructions.htm) (20% of final grade; due Feb. 13th)

2.  Examination on key concepts (Apr. 3rd) (30% of final grade; "open book")

3.  [ Case study](case_study.htm) (medium-length paper, 10-12 pages) (30% of final grade; paper topic due

     Mar. 13th, final paper due Apr. 17th)



Please carefully proofread your assignments for accuracy in spelling and
grammatical construction--such errors do play a part in your grade,
particularly if they affect the instructor's ability to understand the content
or import of your writing.



Failure to complete any of the three written assignments will result in a
failing grade in the course.



Also, please familiarize yourself with the School of Information Science's
_Guidelines on Academic Integrity_ , found at:   [
http://www2.sis.pitt.edu/~wadmin/academics/information/
sisacint.html](http://www2.sis.pitt.edu/%7Ewadmin/academics/information/%20sisacint.html)
.  It is the student's responsibility to carefully document his or her work
using the appropriate style of citation.   Be aware that plagiarism will not
be tolerated and will result in a failing grade in this course.





### Required Texts

Access_ (Andover, MA:  Northeast Document Conservation Center, 2000).

## Accommodations

__

  
Students with disabilities who require special testing accommodations or other
classroom modifications should notify the instructor and the office of
Disability Resources  & Services (DRS) no later than the 3rd week of the term.
Students may be asked to provide documentation of their disability to
determine the appropriateness of the request.  DRS is located in 216 William
Pitt Union and can be contacted at 412-648-7890 (voice), 412-624-3346 (fax),
and (412) 383-7355 (TTY).



Students who must miss an exam or class due to religious observance must
notify the instructor ahead of time and make alternative arrangements.

__

_  
A note to students in the Archival Studies program_ :



The instructors for the archival studies program (Cox, Gracy, Marshall, and
Whorley) are aware that the courseload for Spring 2002 is particularly heavy
for full-time students.   If you are carrying five courses this term, you will
be given the option of taking an incomplete in one of those courses.   Please
note that the deadline to opt for an incomplete in this course is **April 3rd.

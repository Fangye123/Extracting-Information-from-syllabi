Each student will be evaluated for the purpose of assigning a letter grade by
their performance on the graded material described below according to the
following proportions (no exceptions to this grading schedule will be
permitted):` `

    
    
    
            Midterm                              33%             
    
    	Final           	                    40%             
    
    	Individual Assignments               10%             
    
    	Group Assignments                    12%             
    
    	Individual Participation               5%
    
                TOTAL:                               100%
    
     Midterm: The midterm examination will cover all material discussed
    
    in class, on the group and individual assignments up to the exam
    
    date.  The exam format will be a combination of various types of
    
    questions including: truefalse, multiple choice, short answer
    
    questions and problems.  The midterm will be retained by the
    
    instructor and will not be returned to the student.  A missed exam
    
    will result in a score of zero.
    
    
    
    Final: This examination will be cumulative and will cover all
    
    material discussed in class, in the text and in the assignments. 
    
    The final will be a combination of various types of questions
    
    including: truefalse, multiple choice, short answer questions and
    
    problems.  Students must take the final at the scheduled time.
    
    Individual Assignments: Several individual assignments will be
    
    given, including two from the Systems Understanding Aid and are to
    
    be completed on an individual basis.  Some assignments will require
    
    the use of the Internet.  The assignment requirements and due dates
    
    will be discussed in class.
    
    
    
    Group Assignments: The group projects will require the use of
    
    computing resources in addition to the text and other resources. 
    
    The project requirements and due dates will be discussed in class. 
    
    Groups will consist of no fewer than two and no more than six
    
    people and each member will be asked to evaluate the other members
    
    contribution.  The written component of the group project should
    
    include the following information on the first page:  Project
    
    title, names of group members, date, and a brief description of all
    
    material (printouts, reports, diagrams, and so forth) that are
    
    being turned in.  The pages should be stapled or otherwise fastened
    
    together.  The projects do not have to be typed but must be
    
    readable.  Projects with loose pages, unexplained computer output,
    
    or otherwise not in compliance with the above instructions will not
    
    be accepted.
    
    
    
    Individual Participation: The student should be prepared to
    
    contribute to class discussions.  The grade for individual
    
    participation will be based on unannounced inclass assessments,
    
    attendance taken on random days and the amount of positive
    
    individual participation in discussions in class or through email.
    
    
    
    Additional Information:
    
    The penalty for late individual and group assignments is 50%
    
    of the maximum points.
    
    
    
    Students who are absent from a class are responsible for all
    
    material, topics and assignments (including due dates) that
    
    were covered.
    
    
    
    Students will need full access to the Internet.  GMU UNIX 
    
    accounts (free to students) are preferred and can be obtained
    
    at the computer center.
    
    
    
    No extra credit assignments or projects will be given.

**Introduction to Political Theory** **Professor Schneck, Fall 1997**

    
    
    
    
    Scholars working within the field called political theory are
    concerned with two general topics.  They are concerned with the
    history of ideas as it relates to civilization and politics. 
    And, they are concerned with understanding politics and
    civilization, both theoretically (What's true?) and normatively
    (What's good?).  The first topic deals more with the historical
    development of ideas and the relationship of those ideas to
    politics.  The second deals more with analysis of actual
    politics.
    
    In a sense, every study of politics that does more than merely
    journalistically report the facts is a version of political
    theory--however simple it may be.  You have already done
    political theory in your studies of American politics and world
    politics.  When Henry Kissinger developed his version of the
    "realist" model for U. S. foreign policy, he was doing political
    theory.  When James Barber identified FDR as an "active-positive"
    president, he was doing political theory.  Likewise, whenever you
    have engaged in making judgements or analyses of domestic or
    international politics in non-partisan terms--for example, using
    ideas like those of human rights or the balance of power--you
    were attempting to do political theory.
    
    As an introduction, this course is designed to offer a broad
    survey of the field of political theory.  Like political theory
    itself, there are two general topics being pursued in the course. 
    The first is a tracing of the development of political and
    civilizational ideas in Western history--from Plato, four
    centuries before Christ, to Karl Marx and John Stuart Mill, who
    wrote just before our own century was about to begin.  The second
    topic of the course concerns the stuff of politics and deals with
    questions of right, justice, nature, history, truth, order,
    utility, liberty, and equality.  This second topic will be
    explored in our reflections on the ideas presented in the various
    readings.
    
    
    Requirements:
    
    The popularity of this course comes from the intellectual fun of
    playing with ideas.  This is a fun course in that sense.  It is
    not an easy course.  The reading load is as heavy as for some
    graduate courses, and you absolutely must keep up since the
    various tests are really picky about details in the readings.  No
    joke, you should plan on spending eight hours each week in
    reading and writing for this course.
    
    There will be two papers to write, each eight to ten pages in
    length.  The professor is really a perfectionist on these papers,
    every little thing must be perfect.  The first paper is due on
    Monday, September 29th.  The second is due on Friday, December
    5th.  Each of the papers will be reflective essays on an assigned
    topic.  See the attached style sheet for the papers' rules.
    
    Two tests are scheduled, a mid-term and a final.  The mid-term
    examination is set for Monday, October 20th.  The final exam will
    be held on a date and time to be determined by the Registrar.
    
    Each of the papers and both of the exams are worth 25 points, for
    a possible total of 100 points.  Some additional points can be
    made in discussion groups.  The few points from discussion group
    performance often make all the difference when there are only one
    hundred total points for the course.  Grades will be determined
    as follows:
    
              A = 90-100     D = 60-69 
              B = 80-89      F < 60
              C = 70-79
    
    Many students seem to get grades somewhat lower than they are
    accustomed.  The average point total over the last few years has
    been in the upper 70s.  About 15% of the class usually get an "A"
    for the course.  
    
    Class attendance is required.  A sign in sheet will be passed
    around with every class.

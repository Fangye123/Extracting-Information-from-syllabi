PHI 212: HUMAN NATURE | Fall 1997| Garth Kemerling| Office C-117 | 8:00 W|
[gkemerling@newberry.edu](mailto:gkemerling@newberry.edu)| (803) 321-5198  
Content and Objectives:     Students in this course will examine philosophical
issues about the nature and function of human beings, including: the
relationship between mind and body, the phenomenology of consciousness, the
operation of will, the social significance of gender, the ability to use
language, and the unity of the self or identity of the person.  
  
Requirements and Grading:     The asynchronous learning format we'll employ
most of this semester permits individual students to work as they wish during
each week--working an hour each day or devoting an entire day at a time. But,
no matter how different our individual learning styles, we'll proceed together
by following the weekly schedule listed below. Each week, students are
required to do all of the following:     Carefully
[read](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#rea) the designated sections of
the textbooks;     Look at the on-line materials that deal with the same
topics;     Participate in the discussions under way in the [electronic
forum](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#for) for this course; and
Complete any scheduled written "Assignment" and e-mail it to
[gkemerling@newberry.edu](mailto:gkemerling@newberry.edu).  
Each of these components is an important portion of your work for the course,
and everyone will be expected to complete all of them.     All
[written](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#wri) assignments will be
graded on the usual standards for philosophy courses, and the average of all
assignment grades will count for about two-thirds of the final grade for the
semester. Once or twice each month, I'll e-mail you a report of the grades you
earned on the most recent assignments and your course average so far. A
summary of results for the entire class will be posted regularly.     Informed
participation in our electronic
[discussion](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#dis) of the readings is a
vital component of the course and will be evaluated, counting as the remaining
third of the final grade for the course. I'll be prompting discussion of a
particular topic each week, but you are welcome to initiate other topics by
making a claim or asking a question.  
    I hope that everyone will make frequent use of the hypertext materials on this site, which include (in addition to this syllabus and the associated lessons and assignments): a generic [philosophy study guide](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm), a [dictionary](http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/index.htm) of philosophical terms and names, a [timeline](http://www.philosophypages.com/dy/zt.htm) showing major philosophers of the tradition, access to [electronic texts](http://www.philosophypages.com/sy.htm#tex) for many of the books written by our thinkers, and a short list of other [Internet resources](http://www.philosophypages.com/links.htm) for research in philosophy.  
    All students should be familiar with Newberry College policies on academic credit, grading, and academic dishonesty, as published in _The Student Handbook_ and with the following official statement: "If you are a student with a disability, it is your responsibility to contact the professor during the first week of class to inform him/her of any reasonable accommodations needed."

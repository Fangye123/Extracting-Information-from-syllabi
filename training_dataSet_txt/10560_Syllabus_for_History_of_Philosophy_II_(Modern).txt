argument is (and /or could be) given for this thesis? 3) How can the argument
or the thesis be criticized? 4) What is your own position on the issue

Notes on Grades
Midterm and Final
Exam.
        These will be closed-note
and closed-book exams. The final will be cumulative.  The exams will
be partly essay-style, with questions based on our readings, class discussions,
and the oral presentations.
Oral Presentation
    Sign up by January 31 for a date on which to give
your oral presentation.  (See the Reading Schedule for available dates.) 
Note that your paper is due one week before your oral presentation and
that an outline or draft of the paper is due two weeks before your oral
presentation.
    Your presentation should last approximately 10 minutes
and should consist of a presentation of  the issue, the central thesis,
and the main arguments that are found in your Term Paper.
    Use notes, or your paper itself, if you wish, but
DO NOT READ your presentation.
    You will be graded on style and content.  (Do
not mumble. Make eye contact.  Use handouts or other visual aids. 
Present good reasons for your view. Be clear and consistent. Anticipate
and address plausible objections.)
    Expect one of the following grades:
        95   Truly Outstanding
Presentation
        85   Fairly Good
Presentation
        75   There is
a noticeable problem in style or content.
        65   There is
more than one problem in style or content.
          0   
No presentation
Term Paper
    The term paper is due one week before your oral
presentation is to be given.  An outline or draft of the paper must
be submitted one week before your paper is due.  This outline or draft
must also be approved by me.
    The paper should be approximately eight (plus or
minus two), double-spaced pages with reasonable margins and font size.
    Essential to the paper is a statement of your own
view of the issue raised and your reasons for it, as well as a defense
of your thesis against some good objection. .  I suggest the following
procedure:  a) Select a short article or book excerpt;  b) Describe
and evaluate the central theses and arguments of the author; c)  State
your own view and your main reasons for it; d) defend your view against
some good objection.
    An optional paper may be turned in by April 16. The
topic of the paper must be explicitly approved by me, and
a rough draft or detailed outline of the paper must be turned in to me,
at least one week before you submit the paper. This paper will increase
your midterm exam score by 0 to 10 percentage points.
    A revised version of your paper may be submitted
by April 30. This will increase your paper grade by 0 to 10 points. Substantial
improvements in the paper must be made to receive any extra credit for
this.
NOTE:  Plagiarism will result in a failing grade for the course
and a referral to the Dean of Students' office. Dismissal from the college
is a penalty the Dean may impose.
Homework.
        These are short writing
assignments (typically one or two paragraphs), due at the beginning
of the next class meeting.  (You may email or fax your homework to
me prior to the beginning of class.)  You may skip any two of these,
but one point will be deducted from your course grade for each assignment
(beyond the first two) not done.  There is no limit to the number
of points you can lose for this.
        Your answer to these assignments
may be used as a basis for class discussion. (They may be read out in class.)
 
 
Attendance and Participation.
        Please attend every class
and be prepared to contribute to the class discussion of the readings.
You may miss five classes without penalty.  After that, one point
will be deducted from your course grade for each unexcused absence. 
Absences are excused for medical reasons (for example), but you must provide
a note.  Check with me before you miss class or immediately after
your return; otherwise, your absence will be unexcused.
        One point will be lost for
lack of preparation.  (Each time you are called on in class and haven't
a clue, one point will be deducted from your course grade.)
    There is no limit to the number of points you can
lose for unexcused absences or lack of preparation.

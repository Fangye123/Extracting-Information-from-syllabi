**ABOUT THE COURSE:   The goals of this course are as follows: 1) to provide
students with an increased understanding of the history of the modern American
presidency, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to William Jefferson Clinton; 2) to
help students develop research skills that will allow them to continue to
learn from the past, a goal that includes increasing their familiarity with
the AU Library, the world wide web and other sources; 3) to help students
learn to better communicate their knowledge -- orally, in writing, and through
the medium of the world wide web; and 4) to help students develop an informed
understanding of historical practice -- the interplay of history and memory,
the role of evidence, how history is created or "constructed" by journalists,
historians, museum curators, film makers and many others.**

**Requirements:   The course is based on extensive readings, discussion, use
of the AU library and the world wide web.  You will be expected:**

  * **to attend class regularly**
  * **to keep up with all assigned readings**
  * **to complete all class assignments in a timely manner**
  * **to actively participate in class discussion**
  * **to actively participate in the creation of a major Team Project**
  * **to take a final examination**
  * **For more details, click on[Assessment](Assessment.htm).**

**The Class Format:**

> **1.   Before each class, you will be expected to complete the required
readings and prepare a brief written assignment.  (For details, click on [The
Assignments](H296assignments.htm).)  Your assignment should be posted to your
Lotus Notes Discussion Group no later than the Sunday preceding Monday's
class.  (For details on how to do this, click on [Using Lotus
Notes](Lotus.htm).)**  
> **2.   At the beginning of each class we will attempt to place the president
under study in broad historical perspective: his early life, how he came to
power, the challenges he faced, his major accomplishments, etc.  During the
second half of the class, we will discuss one or more major issues facing that
president.**

**Two Important Notes:**

> **  1) The class will require some use of computers: the syllabus is posted
on "the Web";  the class will utilize the virtual group discussion features of
Lotus Notes; the final Team Projects will take the form of web sites.  You do
_not_ need to be a computer expert to succeed in this course.  You _do_ need
to be willing to work hard and learn how these new technologies can assist
classroom learning.**

>

> **2)   The class will involve some group work: the class will be divided
into teams, each of which will be responsible for two class presentations and
one final Team Project.  Collaborative work can sometimes be very demanding
and not all students enjoy working in teams.  You don't have to be a social
butterfly to do well in group settings; you do need to be prepared to work
hard on both the course content and the dynamics of your group.**

**Course Description**

Self-representation--whether personal, legal, medical, spiritual, or literary
--is an act many modern women take for granted. But in medieval England,
debates raged over how and why women should be represented in literature, as
well as by whom. What difference does it make whether women function as texts'
creators or creations? What happens when male authors ventriloquize female
voices, or when women pick up the proverbial pen and author voices for
themselves? The readings for this writing seminar will take us through an
outlandish tour of women figures, from cross-dressing virgin martyrs and
warrior women to cheating wives and imprisoned nuns, in texts ranging from
medical treatises, to spiritual autobiographies, to Chaucer's _Canterbury
Tales_. We will also look at modern "remakes" of these figures in such films
as [_Anchoress_](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0106271) and [_Le Retour de Martin
Guerre_](http://us.imdb.com/Title?0084589), in order to assess how our ideas
of the medieval woman and her possible modes of (self-) representation have
changed. Using such texts as launching points, seminar participants will
develop their writing interests and skills, and will learn to do more advanced
argumentation and textual analysis.

Course Requirements**

**I. Readings**

The course readings consist of varying lengths, from quite short (like the
hagiographical readings and Marie de France's _lais_ ) to quite long (like
Margery and Julian). I suggest you begin reading the longer texts
(particularly _The Book of Margery Kempe_ and _Revelations of Divine Love_ )
at least a week in advance of their due dates. You are responsible for
completing all readings by the dates assigned on the course schedule.

**II. Writing and Revision**

**a. Short Assignments** : As we work on each writing concept, I will assign
you short writing projects, usually no more than 1 page in length. The
frequency of these assignments will vary throughout the semester, with more
being assigned towards the beginning than the end. You should view these short
writing projects as steps in your development as a writer: not every
assignment will tie into a longer essay, but each will help you learn specific
writing concepts.

**b. Essays** : You will write two medium-length essays for this class. These
will be staggered throughout the semester, and will consist of two drafts
each. The first draft of each essay should be a clean copy, free of typos; the
draft will receive a provisional grade from me and may be reviewed in class by
your peers. The second, revised version will receive a final grade from me.
The third and final essay you will write should consist of 7-8 pp., and may
expand upon one of your earlier essays or short assignments; this essay will
be on a topic identified by you. We will approach this final essay in stages
by doing topic workshops, abstracts, and outlines, but there will be only one
official draft.

**NOTE** : I will not accept assignments sent over e-mail unless you also
provide me with a hard copy. I will only grant extensions under extenuating
circumstances, and you must speak to me as far in advance of the due date as
possible in order to receive extra time. If you have not contacted me and you
do not turn in an assignment, you will receive a failing grade.

**c. Comment Responses and Revision Goals** : For each of your longer
assignments, you will receive comments from me and/or from your peers. In
turn, you will be required to respond to all comments in writing. In addition,
using these comments, you should develop a written list of specific revision
goals, at least two per assignment. Then you will revise, doing your best to
meet the goals you have set. You will turn in these comment responses and
revision goals (along with all drafts) when you turn in each final essay; the
comment responses will make up part of your paper grade, and if they are
missing, your grade will be docked.

**d. Conferences** : You should plan to have a writing conference with me at
least once before the end of October, and should make good use of the writing
tutors to be found at the Kelly Writers house, on Bennett Hall's fourth floor,
and in the residence buildings. (You may be required to do so if your first
paper grade is lower than a B.) I will schedule conferences with you once this
semester, but you are encouraged to come see me during office hours, or to
make additional appointments to discuss your papers.

**III. Attendance and Participation**

**a. Attendance** : You should make every effort to attend all classes.
According to university policy, more than 4 absences will incur a failure for
the course; according to my own policy, your grade will begin to drop after
your second absence. I will administer frequent pop quizzes in the first 5
minutes of class: they will make up part of your participation grade, and can
not be retaken, nor will you get extra time to finish the quiz if you came to
class late.

**b. Participation** : You will all be expected to contribute to class
discussion. This contribution will often take the form not just of talking,
but also of listening closely to your classmates and to me. Be sure to take
notes on what other students are saying, as well as what I say. I will ask
many of the discussion questions, but you are the ones giving most of the
answers: listen to and respond to each other, not just to me.

**c. Listserv Postings** : Everyone will be responsible for posting a reading
response to the listserv at least three times during the semester. I will hand
out a sign up sheet during the second week of class. Two people will respond
to each text that we read, and all postings must be sent by midnight on the
Sunday of the week they are due. Each posting must be at least 100 words: it
should first make an observation about the text, and should then pose two
discussion questions to get us started at our next meeting. You will be held
responsible not only for posting in a responsible and timely manner, but also
for reading the postings of your peers. If you have not done so, you will not
be prepared for class, and your participation grade will suffer. **

Grading**

Essay 1 -------------- 15%  
Essay 2 -------------- 25%  
Essay 3 -------------- 30%  
Short assignments ---- 10%  
Class participation -- 20%

(Click [here](grading.html) to see my grading standards)

**NOTE** : In the School of Arts and Sciences, a grade of C- or lower in a
writing class necessitates you re-taking the class (in other words, a grade
lower than a C incurs a failure). Bear this in mind throughout the semester.

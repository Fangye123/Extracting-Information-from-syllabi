This course is highly web-based.

  * The lectures are presented in class with the aid of web pages 
    * permits presentation of images and text 
    * makes taking notes easier 
      * focus on main points 
      * not details that you can review later on the web 
    * Some students have found it useful to print out the web lectures the night before, and take notes on the printout during class.
  * Many of the homework assignments will be distributed only as web pages. 
    * Some of these assignments will require you to access other web sites as well.  

The two most basic web pages for this course are:

  * The [syllabus](syllabus.html) gives the basic requirements and related details. 
    * You should have an "official" paper copy of this page. 
  * The [schedule](schedule.html) gives the week-by-week topics and assignments. 
    * what topics will be discussed in each lecture 
    * what pages in the textbooks should be read 
    * when the homeworks are due (with links to them) 
    * links to the lecture notes for the course (including this page)

**How to learn the material in this class**

Read and understand the course texts.

  * Read Pinker's _Language Instinct_ first, for more general concepts. 
  * Use _The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Linguistics_ for more detailed examples and elaboration. 
    * unless specifically mentioned in the study guide, you don't have to memorize details in the many "sidebars." 

Review the on-line lecture notes.

  * You will **not** be responsible for material contained on other web sites provided as links in the basic lecture notes. 

Pay attention during lectures.

  * Additional material and explanation will be presented orally. 

Master the ideas and skills featured in the homework assignments.

  * These are discussed in class after they are returned. 

If you do this, then you should be adequately prepared for the quizzes and the
final, for which there will also be a [study guide](study.html).

**What is linguistics?**

The simple answer is that linguistics is the scientific study of human
language. This is a very broad area, so we'll consider some more specific
pursuits and sample issues.

**Sociolinguistics** : Language in social context.

> How does language reflect the social identity of the speaker?

>

> What are accents? How do dialects develop and change?

**Syntax** : How words are organized into sentences.

    * You can omit "that" in **This is the book ( _that_ ) I bought.**
    * But not in **This is the book _that_ was too expensive.** 

**Morphology** : How new words are created from smaller pieces.

> There are two meanings for the word **unlockable** depending on its
structure.

>

>   1. un + lockable: there's no latch on the door, so you can't lock it

>   2. unlock + able: we've got the key now, so we can unlock it

**Phonetics** : The physical nature of speech, how sounds are articulated and
perceived.

> Sounds of all languages are described according to their "features," of
which this is a small matrix.

  |   | _alveolar_ | _velar_  
---|---|---|---  
| _stop_ | **t** | **k**  
| _fricative_ | **s** | **?**  
  
> The sound missing from English -- a velar fricative -- is found in borrowed
words like _ch_ utzpah and Ba _ch_.

**Phonology** : The use and patterning of sounds in language.

> Can you hear the difference between the stop sounds in these pairs of words?

  | **pit** | **spit**  
---|---|---  
  | **take** | **stake**  
  | **kill** | **skill**  
  
> When [p, t, k] occur at the beginning of the word, they're aspirated (with a
puff of air); preceded by [s], they're not. This is a property of English
phonology, and other languages often treat these sounds very differently.

**Semantics** : The meanings of words and how they combine into sentence
meanings.

> Notice the ambiguity of meaning in this headline.

>

>> **Twenty-year friendship ends at altar.**

>

> Compare The show ends tomorrow, and The road ends in a cul-de-sac. Because a
relationship can be treated metaphorically as a journey along a road, this
ambiguity is possible for "friendship."

**Pragmatics** : The effect of situation on language use.

> These sentences can all express the same request, but often indirectly.

>

>> **Please shut the window.  
>  It's cold in here.  
>  I wonder if we should shut the window.  
>  Do you feel a draft?**

**Historical linguistics** : How languages change over time.

> In what ways did Latin change to become the various modern Romance
languages?

>

> How can comparison of known languages permit us to reconstruct the form of
languages not spoken for 5000 years or longer?

**Psycholinguistics** : How language is represented in the mind, and how it is
acquired.

> Why do people sometimes make errors like **I have a sti _ck_ ne _ff_**?

>

> How do children learn the complexities of a language without formal
instruction?

**Neurolinguistics** : How language is realized in the brain.

> Are the abilities to pronounce words and to understand sentence structure
located in different places in the brain?

**Evolutionary linguistics** : Human language in cross-species context.

> How does animal communication resemble human language?

>

> How did language evolve?

These are just some of the areas of linguistics and related fields that we'll
be discussing.

**What is language?**

The word "language" is used in many different ways. For most linguists,
language __ is the pattern of human speech, and -- what most distinguishes
linguistics from the everyday use -- the (implicit) systems that speaking and
listening rely on.

Other phenomena come to be called "language" because of more or less close
connections or analogies to this central case: writing, sign languages,
computer languages, the language of dolphins or bees. The ordinary-language
meaning of the word reflects this process of extension from a speech-related
core.

Notice the range of meanings in this dictionary entry:

[lan*guage]  
---  
1. | a. | Communication of thoughts and feelings through a system of arbitrary signals, such as voice sounds, gestures, or written symbols.  
  | b. | Such a system including its rules for combining its components, such
as words.  
  | c. | Such a system as used by a nation, people, or other distinct
community; often contrasted with dialect.  
2. | a. | A system of signs, symbols, gestures, or rules used in communicating: _the language of algebra_.  
  | b. | _Computer Science_  A system of symbols and rules used for
communication with or between computers.  
3. |   | Body language; kinesics.  
4. |   | The special vocabulary and usages of a scientific, professional, or other group: " _his total mastery of screen language -- camera placement, editing -- and his handling of actors_ " (Jack Kroll)  
5. |   | A characteristic style of speech or writing: _Shakespearean language_.  
6. |   | A particular manner of expression: _profane language_ ; _persuasive language_.  
7. |   | The manner or means of communication between living creatures other than humans: _the language of dolphins_.  
8. |   | Verbal communication as a subject of study.  
9. |   | The wording of a legal document or statute as distinct from the spirit.  
  
_[American Heritage Dictionary, 4th
ed.](http://www.bartleby.com/61/14/L0041400.html)_  
  
Note that the phenomena named by the extended senses are quite different from
one another.

  * Writing is a system of transcription for speech. 
  * Sign languages used by the Deaf are an expression of the same underlying human capabilities as spoken language, but in a different medium (gesture rather than sound). 
  * Computer languages are artificial systems with some formal analogies (of debatable significance) to the systems underlying human speech. 

* * *

The central role of **spoken** language, as seen by the first definition in
the dictionary entry, is also reflected by the  source of the equivalent word
in various languages. One common strategy is simply to use the word **tongue**
to express the concept  "language": it's one of that organ's most obvious
functions in modern humans.

  * French _langue_
    * same root as English _language_
  * Spanish _lengua_
  * Greek _glossa_
  * Russian _jazyk_
  * Irish _teanga_
  * Hebrew _l ashon_
  * Hausa _harsh ee_
    * a Chadic language of Nigeria and Niger 
  * and of course English _tongue_! 

Another typical source is a word related to a verb such as **speak** or
**say** , the basic linguistic act; or a noun meaning **speech** or
**word(s)** , what language consists of.

  * German _Sprache_
    * cf. _sprechen_ "to speak"
  * Dutch _taal_
    * related to English _tale_
  * Sanskrit _bh aSa_
    * cf. _bh aS-_ "speak"
  * Mandarin Chinese _y u (yan)_
    * also "talk; words, speech"
  * Japanese _kotob a_
    * also "word"
  * Korean _mal_
    * also "words, speech"
  * Hawaiian _' olelo_
    * also "to say"
  * Alsea _yul_
    * also "to speak"; a native language of Oregon 
  * Kashaya _cahno_
    * also "to utter" and "word"; a native language of California  

The core of the field of linguistics has always been the analysis of spoken
linguistic structure, and this course will introduce the basic concepts of
this disciplinary core. However, there's a lot of intellectual, practical and
human interest in other aspects of the study of language, and we'll mention
these as well when it's appropriate.

* * *

**What's a dialect?**

In common parlance, "dialect" implies a nonstandard variety of a language.
This can be seen in the first definition below, which uses "language" for the
standard variety. (Cf. definition 1c for "language" above.)

[di*a*lect]  
---  
1. | a. | A regional or social variety of a language distinguished by pronunciation, grammar, or vocabulary, especially a variety of speech differing from the standard literary language or speech pattern of the culture in which it exists: _Cockney is a dialect of English_.  
  | b. | A variety of language that with other varieties constitutes a single
language of which no single variety is standard: _the dialects of Ancient
Greek_.  
2. |   | The language peculiar to the members of a group, especially in an occupation; jargon: _the dialect of science_.  
3. |   | The manner or style of expressing oneself in language or the arts.  
4. |   | A language considered as part of a larger family of languages or a linguistic branch. Not in scientific use: _Spanish and French are Romance dialects_.  
  
_[American Heritage Dictionary, 4th
ed.](http://www.bartleby.com/61/49/D0194900.html)_  
  
Thus, non-linguists often make this distinction:

> **Language** as  "the prestige dialect of some language" (whether the user
of the term acknowledges this or not).

>

> **Dialect** as  "a non-prestige dialect of some language" or even "an
unwritten language."

>

>> Cf. the common uses such as "American Indian dialects" to describe what are
actually hundreds of distinct languages, many with their own internal
dialectal complexities.

For linguists, however, no one actually speaks an entire "language"; rather,
every utterance occurs in some (social and geographical) dialect of a
language.

  * Different dialects are mutually intelligible varieties of a language. 
  * Different languages are not mutually intelligible with one another. 

Nonstandard dialects lack prestige, but not logic or communicative function. A
dialect may be socially stigmatized, just like a particular word or usage may
be; but that says nothing about its linguistic status.

* * *

**Dialects and languages**

A consequence of the "language instinct" is that the forms of language spoken
by all humans (setting aside brain traumas and the like) are of equal status
as examples of the innate ability to learn and use language \-- just as all
thumbs are examples of the human ability to pick things up.

> This includes standard and non-standard dialects of a language, as well as
languages with a long written history and those which have never been written
down.

It's important to remember that for linguists, the term "dialect" refers to a
specific variety of some language.

> Everyone speaks a dialect, whether it's considered a prestigious one or not.

A "language" consists of a set of mutually intelligible dialects. If you speak
one of those dialects, then it could also be said that you "speak that
language"; but in a sense no one speaks a "language", since that's an
abstraction over multiple varieties of speaking.

> For example, informally I can say that I speak English.

>

> But what I really speak is a particular variety of English, what one might
call General American, but even that's an abstraction.

>

>> My usual dialect of English is primarily Western -- no distinction between
_merry_ and _marry_ , _cot_ and _caught_ \-- but details about my background
(earlier childhood spent in New Jersey) mean that I sometimes make these
distinctions anyway.

>>

>> And specific items distinguish me from some people who might share these
other features:

>>

>>   1. I usually say "ketch" for _catch_.

>>   2. I don't say sentences like _He seems really tired _anymore__ (=
_lately_ , _these days_ ).

>>

When you really get down to it, everyone actually speaks an **idiolect** : the
specific form of speech of one individual. "Dialect" is a lower-level
abstraction over similar idiolects, and "language" is a higher-level
abstraction.

> If the question is what's located in the brain in order to make language
possible, the immediate object of study is necessarily the speech of
individuals (i.e. the knowledge in individual brains).

>

> But because language is used for communication, of course, individual
idiolects are often very similar, based on similar linguistic experiences.

>

>> If they are **** quite similar, they belong to the same **dialect**.

>>

>> If they are only somewhat similar, they belong to the same **language**.

The gradient nature of similarity is why it's sometimes difficult to draw a
distinction between "dialects" and "languages."

* * *

**Beliefs about language**

Attitudes toward dialects bring up the fact that linguists and laypeople often
have different views toward linguistic issues.

There are plenty of valid controversies about language. Some questions are
entirely political:

  * should governments try to accommodate speakers of minority languages? 
  * how important is it to maintain rigorous standards of usage? 
  * is it bad to borrow words from another languages rather than inventing native ones? 

Other questions are factual, though they have immediate practical
consequences:

  * does bilingual education work? 
  * what are the consequences of oral education for deaf children? 
  * to what extent can ordinary citizens understand legal contracts? 
  * how well do computer speech recognition systems work? 

Still other questions are mainly interesting to those who care about language
itself:

  * are Korean and Japanese derived from the same ancestral language? 
  * how much of linguistic structure is an innate faculty of the brain, and how much emerges from the experience of communication? 

Reasonable and informed people can and do disagree about these and innumerable
other linguistic issues. Particular arguments may be illogical, or particular
claims may be false, as in any debate, but our state of knowledge leaves room
for a range of opinions.

* * *

On the other hand, there are some disagreements about language where one side
is just wrong, as wrong as those who believe that [the Earth is
flat](http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/flatearth.html) or that it was created
out of nothing in [4004 BCE](http://www.lhup.edu/~dsimanek/ussher.htm).

These include plenty of misconceptions about language among otherwise
reasonable people, simply because they have never really learned how language
works.

  * Non-standard dialects are less logical than standard dialects. 
  * Languages degrade over time. 
  * The language that you speak determines the way you think. 

In this course we'll see why these myths are, in fact, provably wrong. For
more examples, see [The sci.lang FAQ](http://zompist.com/langfaq.html).

* * *

**" Grammar"**

When beginning the study of linguistics, it's also important to understand
what linguists normally mean by the word _grammar_. The following distinction
is crucial.

**Prescriptive grammar** : Rules of proper usage that distinguish "good"
grammar from "bad" grammar. An example according to this perspective:

  1. Good: 
    * **He doesn't know.**
  2. Bad: 
    * **He don't know.** 

The perceived problem with #2, of course, is that verbs in standard English
generally require the agreement suffix _-(e)s_ when the subject is third
person singular, i.e. _does_ rather than _do_.

(Not all verbs do this, however: Even in standard English, so-called modal
verbs such as _can_ , _will_ , _should_ , etc. never take this agreement
suffix. So clearly subject-verb agreement is not necessary for the language to
function! Many languages dispense with it entirely, such as Swedish and
Chinese.)

* * *

**Descriptive grammar** : What native speakers know about their language in
order to make use of it. A similar example according to this perspective:

  1. Grammatical (depending on dialect, style, etc.): 
    * **He doesn't know.**
    * **He don't know.**
  2. Ungrammatical (regardless of style): 
    * ***He not know.**
    * ***He known't.**
    * ***Not know he.** 

(The asterisk means "ungrammatical" in the linguistic sense, i.e. inconsistent
with the native speaker's knowledge and use of the language.)

For a linguist, the sentences in #1 both illustrate a fundamental property of
English, called **do-support** : when most verbs take the negative word _not_
, they require addition of the verb _do_ because the main verb is not
permitted to bear the negation itself.

> The same thing happens in questions:

>

> **Do you know them?  
>  *Know you them?**

Compared to this rather odd and interesting restriction -- it's unknown in
most languages -- the question of whether or not the agreement suffix _-(e)s_
is present seems  quite boring from a scientific point of view.

* * *

It's often said that nonstandard dialects are inferior to the standard dialect
(usually called "language" in this context) because they are less logical, or
simplified versions of the standard.

In fact, the rules by which nonstandard dialects work are often more logical
or more complex than those of standard dialects.

An example of **greater logic** :

> The nonstandard reflexive pronouns **hisself** _,_ **theirselves** use the
possessive pronoun just like _myself, yourself, ourselves_ do.

  | **my** self | **my** hat  
---|---|---  
  | **your** self | **your** hat  
  | **his** self | **his** hat  
  | **her** self | **her** hat  
  | **our** selves | **our** hats  
  | **your** selves | **your** hats  
  | **their** selves | **their** hats  
  
> Standard **himself** _,_ **themselves** irregularly use the object pronoun
form. (We might classify _herself_ this way, so that all third-persons are the
same, but it's ambiguous because _her_ is used as a possessive and as an
object.)

  | **my** self | **_my_ ** hat | see me  
---|---|---|---  
  | **your** self | **_your_ ** hat | see you  
  | **him** self | his **** hat | see **_him_**  
  | **her** self | **_her_ ** hat | see **_her_**  
  | **our** selves | **_our_ ** hats | see us  
  | **your** selves | **_your_ ** hats | see you  
  | **them** selves | their **** hats | see **_them_**  
  
An example of **greater complexity** :

> A nonstandard double negative ( _I don't see nothing_ ) is actually a kind
of agreement with the negative marker **_not_** that modifies the entire
clause.

>

> When the subject of the sentence needs to take this copied negation, the
order is reversed, since the **_not_** has to occur to the left of the
agreeing word.

>

>> Ca _n't_ _nobody_ hold me down.  
>  * _Nobody_ ca _n't_ hold me down.  
>  * _Nobody_ can hold me down.   _(ungrammatical in this dialect)_

>

> If necessary, _ain't_ is added as a kind of  negative support (similar to
standard do-support).

>

>> Ai _n't_ _nobody_ told me.  
>  *__ _Nobody_ told me.   _(ungrammatical in this dialect)_

>

> By the way, many "standard" languages use double negatives all the time,
including French, Spanish, and Russian.

>

>> I do _n't_ see _nothing_.

>>

>> Je _ne_ vois _rien_.  
>  _No_ veo _nada_.  
>  _Nichevo_ _ne_ vizhu.

* * *

**Complexity of "dialects"**

Quite a lot of baggage comes with the use of "dialect" to mean "nonstandard".
Most importantly, it tends to presuppose a form of speech that is in some way
inferior, some kind of "primitive language." From the point of view of
linguistic structure, this is clearly false.

Consider some ways in which languages often termed "dialects" (really
languages) may be more complex or nuanced than things termed "languages."
Pinker mentions Cherokee pronouns, which make more distinctions than English.
The same point can be made for many languages, but first notice how
impoverished standard English pronouns are.

**I go** | **we go**  
---|---  
**you go** | **you go** ( _y'all, youse, you guys_ )  
**he goes  
she goes  
it goes** | **they go**  
  
Notice that nonstandard forms such as **y'all** , **youse** , **you guys**
permit a  distinction between singular and plural that is absent in standard
English (thanks to the historical loss of _thou/thee_ ). This is a very basic
way in which the standard dialect is "inferior" to nonstandard varieties in
its precision.

Quite a number of other distinctions are possible, and native languages of the
Americas typically have a much richer set of pronouns than English and other
European languages. The following examples from Mohawk show pronominal
prefixes with the verb "write," and mean "I am writing," "you are writing,"
etc.

**I:** **k** -hia:tons | **he/she and I** : **iakeni** -hia:tons  
**they and I** : **iakwa** -hia:tons  
---|---  
**you and I** : **teni** -hia:tons | **you (all) and I** : **tewa** -hia:tons  
**you: **s** -**hia:tons | **you (all): **s** ewa-**hia:tons  
**he: ra-**hia:tons  
**she: ie-**hia:tons | **they (male): rati-**hia:tons  
**they (female): konti-**hia:tons  
  
Standard English has 7 pronominal forms, while Mohawk has 11.

> The main difference is that **we** in English means  "the speaker plus at
least one other person," while in Mohawk and many other languages it matters
whether the additional people number just one or more than one, and whether it
includes the addressee ("you"). Plurals in general are more richly expressed
(cf. "you" and "they").

>

> The sole distinction English makes that Mohawk doesn't is the difference
between human (he/she) and nonhuman (it), but only in the third-person
singular.

For any pair of languages, it is possible to find ways in which A is more
complex or expressive than B, and other ways in which B exceeds A in the same
dimension. We've just seen this for English and Mohawk pronouns.

We can also find difference in vocabulary. Here we'll compare two rather
similar languages, English and French.The latter has two verbs for "to know"
depending on what you know is a fact ( _savoir_ ) or a person ( _conna itre_).

_English_ |  _French_  
---|---  
  
**know** | **savoir**  
**conna itre**  
  
English can access a similar distinction, but only by paraphrase.

> **know a thing = be aware of**

>

> **know a person = be acquainted with**

On the other hand, English distinguishes things for which French uses the same
word -- or in this case, phrase.

_English_ |  _French_  
---|---  
  
**last night** | **cette nuit**  
**tonight**  
  
Literally "this night," **cette nuit** is ambiguous out of context but is
normally clear given the tense of the verb (past or future), and can also be
clarified.

> **cette nuit pass ee = "this past night" = last night**

>

> **cette nuit a venir = "this night to come" = tonight**

Many more examples could be provided in either direction.

The important point is that each language is a complex means of expression,
which arises from the basic human ability to learn language. The details by
which they differ, while revealing much about the range of possible human
languages, and therefore just what this ability consists of, are very much
secondary.

* * *

The same contrast holds for different dialects of the same language, as
discussed above. From the "language instinct" perspective, it could not
possibly be otherwise.

> If all humans are endowed with this innate ability \-- like walking on two
feet -- they all will of course reflect this instinct, regardless of social
class, educational background, or other aspects of personal identity that
typically play a role in defining the "standard language."

Some people speak more eloquently than others, just as some walk more
gracefully, but the human characteristic of possessing the ability to use
language (or walking on two feet) is the same.

* * *

**Arbitrary correctness**

For the most part, judgments about what type of language is "right" and what
type is "wrong" is an accident of history. The following example illustrates
how arbitrary it can be at times.

Richard Faust, in _Columbia Magazine_ , 11/83, points out that there is a
historical tendency for the _-ed_ ending to drop in commonly used terms that
start out as phrases of the form **_Verb-ed Noun_** :

**_Newer (reduced) Form_** |

**_Older (full) Form_**  
---|---  
  |  
  
**skim milk** |

skimmed milk  
  
**ice cream** |

iced cream  
  
**popcorn** |

popped corn  
  
**roast beef** |

roasted beef  
  
**wax paper** |

waxed paper  
  
**ice tea** |

**iced tea**  
  
whip cream  |

**whipped cream**  
  
cream corn  |

**creamed corn**  
  
Many of these terms are now standard without the _-ed_ , such as _ice cream_ ,
and they sound odd in the older form. For example, Mr. Burns on "The Simpsons"
is known for his old-fashioned way of talking, as illustrated by the use of
_-ed_ in places where it has generally been abandoned.

"I feel like such a free spirit, and I'm really enjoying this so-called ...
_iced_ cream. "

_Montgomery Burns in The Simpsons

Other phrases have not achieved this status yet, and sound distinctly informal
without _-ed_ , such as _cream corn_. But  in linguistic structure, they are
identical; the relative status depends not on "logic" or "grammatical
correctness" in any meaningful sense, but rather on what has achieved social
acceptability.

Here's a current example. CD's and DVD's are often sold in **box sets** rather
than **boxed sets** , though both terms are common. Two web searches on
[Google](http://www.google.com/), a year apart, found evidence of an
increasing preference for "box set", which continues to today.

| _January 2001_ | _January 2002_ | _May 2002_  
---|---|---|---  
**" box set"** | **144,000** hits |  = **59%** | **333,000** hits |  = **66%**
| **385,000** hits |  = **70%**  
**" boxed set"** | **98,700** hits |  = **41%** | **172,000** hits |  =
**34%** | **168,000** hits |  = **30%**  
  
I personally find the phrase _box set_ rather odd -- I expect to see  "a set
of boxes" \-- but clearly many other speakers of the language have a different
point of view. Either term has ample precedent in English ( _skim milk_ ,
_creamed corn_ ); I just haven't gotten used to this particular phrase yet.

Given the usual trend, and the preference reflected in the web search, _box
set_ is likely to win out. In fact, in the last five months the number of hits
for  "boxed set" has dropped. I'll just have to get used to it, as others in
the past had to get used to _ice cream_ when they had grown up saying _iced
cream_. Those who don't adjust will eventually sound like Mr. Burns.

It's instructive to think of attidutes toward language usage as a kind of
**fashion**.

Some styles are hopelessly outdated.

Speaking today in Elizabethan English, such as asking your roommate _Hast thou
bought the detergent?_ , would be absurd.  
---|---  
  
Other styles are appropriate today, if not in every circumstance.

_Whom did you see?_ is good, but formal, modern English.

It would be silly to ask your friend, _Whom did you see at the frat party?_ |

Still other styles are complete fantasy.

Similarly, some standards of usage have no basis in English grammar, such as
the prohibition on split infinitives.

(This prohibition was based on the fact that a Latin infinitive is a single
word, e.g. _amare_. Since Latin was consider the  "ideal" language, the silly
conclusion was that English two-word infinitives such as _to love_ should be
treated as if they were one word as well!)

Importantly, however, particular styles are appropriate for some contexts but
not for others \-- depending on whether you're accepting an Oscar, chatting on
a talk show, or battling crime.

Similarly, you have to adopt different speaking styles \-- and different
grammatical usages -- depending on the situation, audience, and purpose of
communication. None of these is necessarily "better" than the others from a
linguistic point of view, but one style will usually be the most appropriate
in any given circumstance.

**Changing fashions**

Linguists like to poke fun at prescriptivists by citing some historical
objections that are hard to understand today. This is a bit unfair, since of
course the examples are selected from cases where complaint and ridicule
failed to stem the tide of change. One might also cite a set of linguistic
innovations that died out instead of taking over. On the other hand, people
generally feel compelled to speak out against a particular usage just in case
it is spreading.

In 1837, the Englishman Captain Frederick Marryat ridiculed the following
American usages, which all seem perfectly reasonable today (though some,
especially _stoop_ , do retain a certain informal character).

**fix** | _instead of_   | **prepare**  
---|---|---  
**strike** |    | **attack**  
**great** |    | **splendid**  
**right away** |    | **at once**  
**stoop** |    | **porch**  
  
In books like _Words and Their Uses_ **** (1870) and _Everyday English_
(1880), American Richard Grant White objected to

> "words that are not words, ... a cause of great discomfort to all right
thinking, straightforward people."

His examples of "non-words" included these (with dates of first written
citation in English):

> **reliable  **(1850) **  
> telegraph  <

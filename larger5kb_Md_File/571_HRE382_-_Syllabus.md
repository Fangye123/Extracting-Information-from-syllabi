**Course Description**

The purpose of this course is to assist individuals in learning how adapt and
apply instruction design techniques to technology-oriented environments in
both face-to-face (F2F) and online settings. In doing so, this course provides
learners with theoretical foundations in the fields of instructional design
and instructional technology.  Using an application-oriented approach, this
course provides opportunities for learners to experience the instructional
design process by creating instructional modules using a wide range of
technologies available in educational settings.  Throughout this course,
readings, guidelines, and information are drawn from renown educational
authors such as Gagn¨¦, Dick & Carey, Jonassen, Collins, Saettler, and
Stufflebeam as well as contemporary technology-oriented sources such as c|net,
internet.com, and others.

In addition to examining and applying the theories and practices of the ID/IT
domains, this course provides a strong hands-on component in which 1/3 of all
class time is dedicated to learning and applying prominent technologies such
as digital image editing (Photoshop), digital video editing (Premiere),
Streaming media (RealNetworks) online collaboration environments (Groove.net),
presentation software (PowerPoint), Web page creation (FrontPage/Composer),
and file transfers (WS_FTP).

**Course Objectives**

As a result of lectures, activities, and independent projects, students will
be able to:

  * Select appropriate instructional technologies for various learning tasks/environments [Section II] 
  * Apply principles of instructional design to technology-oriented learning environments [Section III] 
  * Analyze delivery strategies (teaching methods) as applied to instructional technologies [Section IV] 
  * Describe strategies for evaluating technologies in instructional environments [Section VII] 
  * Use prominent technologies and media for developing online content and environments [Lab, all semester]  
  

  * Create appropriate paper-based and online student assessment tools [Section V] 
  * Produce F2F instructional unit [Section VI] 
  * Adapt F2F instructional unit to an online environment [Section VI] 
  * Justify decisions made during instructional development process--for F2F and online environments [Sections II-VII]

**Course Requirements**

**Assignments** | **Due Date** | **% of Course Grade**  
---|---|---  
Multimedia Presentation | 2/7 | 5%  
Mid-term Exam | 3/7 | 20%

Decision Rationales for Online Unit [paper] | 5/9 | 10%  
Weekly Participation & Assignments | weekly | 15%  
**TOTAL** | **-** | **100%**  
  
**Grading Scale**

A    100% - 90%  
B    89% - 80%  
C    79% - 70%  
D    69% - 60%  
F    59% - Below

Finality of Scale:  This scale is strictly a general guideline.  While I will
not raise the percentages associated with each grade range; however I _may_
adjust them slightly to accommodate for unforeseen complexities and grading
variances.   Also, I may impose the use of "+" (and on rare occasions "-")
grades to more accurately reflect performance levels.

Work Quality:  Your work quality should reflect and fulfill the expectations
associated with a course offered by one of the top 10 colleges of education in
the nation--which our's is.  In other words, don't turn in poor quality work;
if you do, it will be returned for you to "redo", see below.

Late & "Redo" Assignments:  Work turned in late is automatically lowered one
letter grade.  As a result, the highest grade late work can earn is "B+".
Assignments that are turned in but fail to meet minimum guidelines for that
project will be returned to the student and redone before a letter grade is
assigned.  These "redo" assignments are treated as being late and consequently
can earn only a "B+" grade at best.

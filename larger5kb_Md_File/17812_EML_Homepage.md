A specialist in West European and Latin American politics, he has written

Something? Regime Change in Cuba." In addition to his work on Cuba, Professor
Mujal-Le車n is also working on a manuscript tentatively entitled _The Domestic
and External Determinants of Spanish Foreign Policy_.

Professor Mujal-Le車n has also developed a number of programs in Argentina

Management and Policy which Georgetown runs in collaboration with the
Universidad Nacional de San Mart赤n (Buenos Aires). He is also co-Director of
the International Institute on Government, Management, and Policy, whose
mission it is to develop public policy and other professional development

**Recently Taught Courses  
  
Spring 2002:  
**_GOVT 308 Dept Sem/Cuba: Regime Change in Comparative Perspective_
(Syllabus)  
This seminar will examine the processes of social, economic and political
change under way in Cuba and the prospects for democratization. The seminar
will review the historical background of Cuban nation-state formation as well
as the nature of the current regime and the dimensions of the crises it
confronts. We shall endeavor to compare the prospects for democratization in
Cuba with the experience of other countries and regimes in Latin America,
Southern and Eastern Europe , and Asia. Participants in the seminar are
expected to have some familiarity with Latin American politics and/or the
literature on democratization.  
**  
Fall 2001** :  
_GOVT 222 Transitions to Democracy_ ([Syllabus](GOVT222F01.pdf))  
This seminar examines the transitions to democracy in Southern Europe and
Latin America as well as the ongoing attempts to build democracy in Eastern
Europe and South Africa. A theoretical framework is developed for comparison
and contrast among the cases.

_NSST 541 Globalization/Security: Americas_ ([Syllabus](NSST541.pdf))  
Globalization has had both integrative and disintegrative consequences for the
US and the Americas. On the one hand it has led to increased economic
integration and interdependence, leading to regional and hemispheric processes
of political and economic integration. Democracy, free markets and trade have
made great strides in the Americas. But globalization has also unleashed
disintegrative forces, like international criminality and economic insecurity.
It also threatens traditional collective cultural identities. This course
attempts a redefinition of national and hemispheric security that takes into
account the new, contradictory challenges of globalization. It assesses the
importance of the process of hemispheric integration, and the particular
challenges presented by issues such as trade, transnational crime and
corruption, drug trafficking, and immigration.

**  
Spring 2001** :  
_GOVT 308 Dept Sem: Cuba: Regional Change in Comparative Perspective_
([Syllabus](GOVT308.pdf))  
This seminar will examine the processes of social, economic, and political
change under way in contemporary Cuba and the prospects for democratization.
The seminar will review the historical background of Cuban nation-state
formation as well as the nature of the current regime and the dimensions of
the crises it confronts. We shall endeavor to compare the prospects for
democratization in Cuba with the experience of other countries and regimes in
Latin America, Southern and Eastern Europe, and East Asia.

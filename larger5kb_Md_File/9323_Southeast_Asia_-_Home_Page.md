**Objectives by Theme**

>  PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Locate the major physical and political features of the realm.

>   2. What are the physical, cultural, economic, and/or historical criteria
(characteristics) used to define this _realm_ and the _regions_ within it? Why
are the boundaries drawn where they are?

>   3. Using maps found in the textbook's introduction (figures I-9, I-4, I-6,
I-7, and I-8), your atlas, and the appropriate textbook chapter, explain where
most people live in this realm and where few people live. Why do they live
there or not live there?  
>  [Previous Harper geography students have identified five criteria which may
explain where people live: 1) near fresh water, 2) flat terrain, 3) near
coasts, 4) temperate climate, and 5) fertile soil. Are these applicable to
this realm?]

>   4. Describe and explain the population distributions of the realm's
mainland, peninsular, and island components. Explain the lower population
density than neighboring realms and the reasons for the clustering of the
population.

>

>

> CULTURAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Discuss the term "Indochina" as it relates to the ethnic mosaic of
Southeast Asia. Why is the term used? Is it accurate?

>   2. Be able to describe the cultural diversity of the realm, particularly
the religious composition of the realm's States.

>   3. List and describe the five territorial morphologies identified in the
textbook and lecture, give examples of States that represent each morphology,
and explain how a State's morphology may impact its cultural and economic
stability.

>   4. Utilize our cultural conflict terminology to describe the current or
recent conflicts in: Myanmar, Cambodia, Vietnam, Mindanao (Philippines), and
East Timor (Indonesia).

>   5. What is the 1997 Mine Ban Treaty, why do many think that it necessary,
and why did the United States refuse to sign it?

>

>

> ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Apply the Measures of Economic Development to the Southeast Asian
realm. Compare the measures of Southeast Asia with other geographic realms.

>   2. Explain recent economic changes in countries in the region (Structural
Adjustment) and assess the effect of these changes on the economic development
of the realm.

>

>

> HISTORICAL GEOGRAPHY

>

>   1. Discuss the various impacts of European (and U.S.) colonialism in this
part of the world.

>   2. Understand the recent political history of countries in the realm and
current political problems.

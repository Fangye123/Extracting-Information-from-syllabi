>  This course is a critical, interdisciplinary study of the culture of
tourism which seeks to make students become more self-aware tourists. We will
take up the notion that modern tourism began as a quest for experiences of
authenticity and explore how tourist sites "stage" themselves to appear
authentic. We will then turn to look at tourist sites such as the new Las
Vegas, Disneyland, and themed shopping malls and ask if the concept of
authenticity is still relevant to tourism, and if not, then what has replaced
it.  
>  All students must do the required reading each week and come to class
having thought about relevant examples from their own tourist experiences to
share. Each week one or two students will be required to give a short
presentation about the readings and help lead off the class discussion. There
are also three short written assignments. Grading breakdown: class discussion
20%, class presentation 15%, three papers: 20%, 30%, 15%.

modern tourism can be viewed as the quest for authenticity even though tourist
sites are often "staged" to appear authentic for tourist consumption.

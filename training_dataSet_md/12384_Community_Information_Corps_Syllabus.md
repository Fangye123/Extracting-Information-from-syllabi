This 1-credit seminar course offers reading, reflection, and social networking
experiences for students who are engaged in projects or considering careers
that put information to work for community and public purposes. Most students
will enroll concurrently in some kind of project work, either through a
Directed Field Experience (DFE), an independent study, a course such as 635,
695, or 699, or a professor-led project (see project examples).

In this seminar, students will read about and discuss theories of community,
civil society, and the role of the non-profit sector, and draw connections
with their project work (reading and reflection). There will also be frequent
opportunities to learn about other students' projects and to meet some of the
national leaders of the community information movement (social networking) and
possibly travel to relevant conferences and workshops. At the end of this
course, students who are interested in pursuing careers in the community
information movement will know how to begin a job search in this area.

You are encouraged to participate for multiple semesters (even all four
semesters of the master's program); while we'll keep revisiting similar
themes, there will be minimal overlap in the readings and activities.

The first day of each semester will be a project-fest, where faculty announce
project opportunities and try to recruit you to join the projects, and Karen
Jordan presents Directed Field Experience opportunities.

## Pre-requisites

Students who have completed SI501 should register for this course as SI697.
Other students should register for this course as SI597.

## Objectives

After participating in SI 597-697, you should be able to:

  * connect day-to-day grassroots activities with big ideas about citizenship, opportunity, and the public good in an information society.
  * find a job as a public informationist.

## **Readings**

Readings will be handed out in class, or available on the Web. You will need
to read materials before class so that we can have lively discussion (see
reaction paper assignments below).

## **Assignments and Due Dates**

This is a 1-credit class. Class meets for an hour and a half each week. You
should spend, on average, about two and a half hours each week outside of
class, doing the following:

  * 24 hours before each class where readings will be discussed, hand in 1-page reaction paper (via email)
  * for any 3 of the guests during the semester, hand in 1-page reaction to the visitor and class discussion one week later
  * Either:
    * find 4-6 information resources to contribute to an on-line guide to job hunting in some area of the community information movement. This guide should include information about conferences, publications, mailing lists, and places where jobs are posted. OR
    * OR contribute to writing and editing the policies and procedures manual for a pilot loan repayment program for graduates who take community and public-oriented jobs. The program will be funded initially by the Alliance for Community Technology and eventually, I hope, by a consortium of foundations.

  * If you're involved in complementary project work, once or twice during the semester you'll be asked to present a 10-15 minute status report to the rest of the class. At the end of the semester you'll be required to hand in a 4-5 page reflection paper tying your project work to the themes and activities discussed in class.

## Travel and Social Networking

If you find a conference that's worth going to that and that you think will
help you in assessing job prospects or developing project ideas for future
semesters, you can ask me for travel funds.

## Grading

Please register for this class pass/fail (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). This
is not a class that lends itself to conventional grading. Last semester, I
graded purely on effort, and almost everyone got an A. The school frowns on
this. So my solution is to ask you to register for the course in a way that
doesn't require you to receive a letter grade.

## Office Hours

Wednesdays 11AM-noon, and by appointment (except January 26 and Feb 2).

## Discussion Questions for Readings

### For January 13: The roles of citizens

Walzer, M. (1998). The Idea of Civil Society: A Path to Social Reconstruction.
In Community Works: The Revival of Civil Society in America. E. J. Dionne.
Washington, DC, Brookings Institution: 123-143.

  1. What are the four straw men (caricatures) that Walzer provides for the ideal roles of individuals in society (i.e., the good life)?
  2. The fifth staw man is the "associational" view, that the ideal role for individuals is to be active members of whichever associations they choose. According to Walzer, how do associations fit into, and modify each of the four other "singular" views of society?
  3. What are Walzer's conclusions about what needs to be done? Do you agree with these prescriptions?
  4. What are the primary information flows in each vision of the good life that Walzer proposes?
  5. What roles can information professionals play in improving each of those information flows?

**Course description**  
  
Processes such as deforestation, species loss, land degradation,
overpopulation, and global warming are, in their causes and their effects,
social and environmental at one and the same time. This seminar examines a
range of approaches to the analysis of ecological and social processes,
drawing on interpretations of different socio-ecological studies by
historians, sociologists and anthropologists to inform our discussions.  
Topics include ideas of nature, colonial conservation science, systems
ecology, the tragedy of the commons, neo-Malthusianism, human ecology, local
knowledge, nomadic pastoralism, ecological degradation and its determinants,
political ecology, women and eco-development, and global environmental
discourse. Interpretations address themes of metaphor, worldviews,
individualism, simpling, environmental determinism, levels of analysis,
relations of production, social construction, gender, subalternity,
technocratic rationality and participatory research.  
****  
**Course goals**  
  
This course aims to work from two angles:  
i) examining the study of ecological and social processes, as undertaken since
World War II in the disciplines of human ecology, geography, anthropology,
range ecology, environmental science, etc ; and  
ii) contributing a social studies of science perspective on these studies.  
Through this two-angle approach students from rural/ development sociology,
natural resources, and history and social studies of science (and other
fields) should become acquainted with a range of the problems and analytic
frameworks of historians, sociologists and anthropologists dealing with
science, and this angle should provide them critical perspectives on the
different analyses of socio-ecological issues that the course reviews.
Although the coverage of "socio-ecological" science can neither be exhaustive*
nor avoid overlapping with other courses, the topics and readings have been
chosen so students should acquire new critical perspectives on the analysis of
socio-ecological issues.  
(*Note: The issues analyzed tend to be Third world and non-urban, and the
interpretive perspectives come mostly from the Western commentators.)  
  
**Requirements**  
  
1\. Reading (sometimes a lot), attendance, and participation in the
discussion.  
2\. Lead (probably with 1 or 2 others) the discussion for 2 seminars. Leaders
must prepare the extra readings (others are encouraged, but not required to),
and interpret their message to the class. Leaders must meet with me in advance
of the class.  
3\. Before class at least 8 times in the semester students must email to the
class list, STS660-L@cornell.edu, two questions that they would like
discussed.  
4\. Undergraduates will be assigned to a peer group(s), which will meet for an
hour in advance of each class in order to prepare for the discussion and to
formulate requests for "background briefings" from me. This makes up the extra
or fourth credit.  
5\. Each week the first part of the seminar will be reading the 1 page
reflection/discussion provocations that students bring to class (at least 5
times in the semester). Bring enough copies for everyone in the seminar.
Emailing these also in advance to the class list will allow discussion leaders
to prepare better for discussions.  
6\. The last part of the seminar each week will consist of 1 or 2 students
giving short presentations on the progress of their term paper research,
conforming to the ideal schedule of progress toward the final term paper (see
below.).  
7\. The term paper will be _either_ a research proposal related to your work
or a _review_ of the growing literature in an area or period of "socio-
ecological" science. Reviews of areas not covered directly or sufficiently in
the syllabus are particularly welcome, e.g. Ecological economics;
Environmental sociology; Deep ecology, environmental ethics and left
ecologies; Sustainable development; New sociology of agriculture; Adaptive
approaches to social  & ecological theory; Conservation Biology; Subaltern
studies and the environment; Women and the environment. I can provide a list
of possible readings for many of these topics. The review should use in a
disciplined and explicit way some of the social studies of science frameworks
or themes introduced in the course. 10-15 pages for undergraduates; 15-20 for
graduates, properly referenced.

8\. Extensions are given only if they are negotiated well in advance, and if
you get more than 2 weeks behind the schedule above, you must propose an
acceptable revised schedule. I do not want any prolonged incompletes from this
course!  
9\. Submission of one or two suggested additions or substitutions to the
readings, with a brief note explaining the recommendation. Due: 12/5  
  
**Grading**

Discussion leading 20  
Submission of reflection/discussion provocations 10  
Progress report on term paper 10  
Term paper 50  
  
Only graduate student auditors will be allowed, and they will be required to
do the reading and participate in class, including to take their turn at
leading discussions and to submit reflection/ discussion provocations.  
  
**Syllabus and readings**  
(Interpretive themes are given in parentheses below the topic.)  
  
Readings will be available from Gnomon copy for around $60 (including
copyright permissions). Some required readings, marked #, are not included in
the reader, mostly because of excessive permission charges. These and the
"extra" readings will be on reserve in xerox form in the Biology  & Society
reading (aka "advising") room (Clark Hall 278; open from 8.30-4.30 M-F only).

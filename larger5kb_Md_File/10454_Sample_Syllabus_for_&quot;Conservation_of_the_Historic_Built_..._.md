>>  
>> **PREREQUISITES:**  
>  This is an upper-level course intended for Grads, Seniors, and Juniors.
Students must already have taken Introduction to Historic Preservation (HIST
715 or 933). If you are unsure whether you are sufficiently prepared, please
see me.  
>  
>>

>> **COURSE GOALS:**  
>  Historic Preservation specialists must be able to "read" the physical
fabric of a building, identify deterioration problems, and suggest solutions.
This course provides a general introduction to this aspect of the preservation
field. The goal is not turn you into a skilled craftsperson or structural
engineer (impossible in 10 weeks), but rather to help you recognize some
common problems and learn about resources to draw upon.

>>

>> Students who successfully complete this course will:

>>

>>   * Gain a basic knowledge of historic building materials and construction
practices.

>>   * Learn how preservationists approach some common deterioration problems.

>>   * Learn about published information and on-line data pertaining to
building materials conservation.

>>   * Get experience documenting an actual deterioration problem, and
researching its solution.

>>   * Develop analytical, writing and verbal skills through reading,
discussion, an in-class presentation, and completion of a research paper.

>>

>>

>>  
> **GETTING OUT IN THE FIELD:**  
>  Most Thursdays we will meet outside the classroom to look at building
materials in the field. Pay close attention to the syllabus so that you will
be at the right place. When driving is required, you may either drive on your
own (please arrive as soon after 2pm as possible), or I will help you arrange
a car-pool ride.

>>

>> It would be helpful (though of course not required) if you could plan your
schedule on Thursdays so that you do not have other commitments immediately
before 2pm or immediately after 4pm.  
>  
>>

>> **QUIZZES, TERM PROJECT AND GRADES:**  
>  QUIZZES: We will have two 30-minute quizzes, one in week 5 and one in week
9. Each will have 5 short-answer questions, covering material from the
preceding 5 weeks. Most questions will be slide-IDs of structural
problems/solutions.

>>

>> CONSERVATION ANALYSIS: Pair up with one other student. Together, find a
structure with a problem. Shoot slides. Write 8 - 12 page research report
explaining how problem is identified and suggesting possible solutions. The
report should include a description of the problem, a well-researched
background discussion of the construction materials involved, proposals for
solutions at this particular site, footnotes or endnotes, and a bibliography.

>>

>> You are responsible for buying and processing your slide film --
approximately a $20 investment. (Kodak's Ektachrome is the good for quick
processing. Rudenic on South Avenue near 224 offers the fastest processing --
in by noon, out by 5pm. Progressive Photo on Belmont Avenue or One-Hour Photo
at several locations offer fairly fast processing -- in by 3pm, back after 5pm
the following day).

>>

>> You should have slides shot and developed by April 28. Make an appointment
that week to show them to me and discuss your progress.

>>

>> The final two weeks of class will be devoted to student presentations and
discussion of these research projects.  
>  
>   Undergraduate grades will be computed as follows:  | quizzes  
> class participation  
> conservation analysis

>>

>> TOTAL | 30%  
> 20%  
> 50%

>>

>> 100%  
>> ---|---|---  
>>  
>> **GRADUATE CREDIT:**  
>  Graduate students may take this course for graduate credit. To foster
deeper engagement with theoretical and factual issues, each grad student will
read 3 additional books and write one 6-8 page review essay discussing all
three selections. (for model review essays, see Journal of Urban History Maag
HT 111 .J68). Grads will meet with the instructor at a time to be arranged
twice during the quarter to discuss the reading.  Final grades for graduates
will be computed as follows:  | quizzes  
> class participation  
> grad review essay  
> conservation analysis

>>

>> TOTAL | 20%  
> 20%  
> 20%  
> 40%

>>

>> 100%  
>> ---|---|---  
>>  
>> **ACADEMIC HONESTY IN WRITING ASSIGNMENTS**  
>  Your papers must never use another writer's words without giving credit.
Quoted words should be put in " " marks, and a citation given indicating the
source. Failure to give proper credit is PLAGIARISM. Plagiarism constitutes
theft, and it will not be tolerated. The punishment for plagiarism is either
an "F" on the paper, and / or an "F" in the course.  
>  
>>

>> **YSU POLICY ON INCOMPLETES:**  
>  Any incomplete not finished within one year (or upon graduation, if that is
earlier) automatically will become an "F" on your permanent transcript.

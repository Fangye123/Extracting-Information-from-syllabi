Course Objective:  
This course is a journey through the continuing evolution of American
politics. We will be investigating the foundations of American politics, the
major institutions of American government, the institutions that give voice to
the people and the process by which policy is made. Throughout the course we
will continue to return to the themes of structure and change. American
politics is a dynamic subject \- one that continues to adapt to our changing
world. It is an exciting subject that touches each of our lives whether we
know it or not. With that in mind, it is important to try to understand it
rather than to stick our heads in the sand and assume that we are safe in our
ignorance. To act, or to be acted upon, this is the choice laid out before us.
The goal of this course is to give you the tools to act in the political
arena, to understand American politics and to critically assess your political
environment. The structure of the rules that govern that environment are not
benign. Our journey will expose their design, their intentions and their
consequences and in doing so will provide you with an appreciation of the
importance of American politics for your world.

Participation and Attendance: Politics is by definition a subject about which
there is great debate. To that end, it is essential that you participate in
class discussions. To do this you must be both present and prepared to
contribute. Being absent from class and not being familiar with the readings
for the week will adversely affect your grade. In other words, in order to not
lose credit in this class you must have minimal absences and participate
frequently and substantially to class discussions. If you have multiple
absences and or infrequent participation you will lose one fraction of your
final letter grade. If you have excessive absences and/or do not participate
in class discussions your final grade will be reduced by one letter grade.

In addition, you will be required to take on-line quizzes at the end of each
chapter in the main textbook. These quizzes are designed to aid you in
comprehending the chapter material as well as to aid me in helping to
determine what topics are not getting through. Your textbook allows you to
take the quiz as many times as you need to - the first time through the
results are reported to me. These quizzes are not graded so your performance
is not an issue. I simply ask that you participate in the exercise honestly so
that we both get the most out of this diagnostic tool. You must complete the
quiz by 11:00 am the day we will be discussing the chapter in class to
maintain your participation grade.

Lecture versus Reading: What do I really need to do?  
You should not expect that lecture or class discussion will cover all of the
topics discussed in the readings. Likewise, you should not expect the readings
to discuss all of the topics presented in class. In other words, you need to
read and you need to be present in order to get the most out of this class.

Classroom Guidelines:

I disagree with what you have to say, but I will defend to the death your
right to say it.  
-Voltaire

Politics is also a subject that, by definition, often involves disagreement.
In this class you are free to disagree with me and with one another. But if we
are to have productive discussions about politics in class, we must limit
ourselves to respectful disagreement. At no time is it acceptable to engage in
mean-spirited or personal attacks. Each member of the class must be treated
with respect at all times no matter how strongly you may disagree with their
political perspective.

Academic Integrity:  
From Bucknell's policy on academic responsibility: "Bucknell Students are
responsible to the academic community for the preparation and presentation of
work representing their own individual efforts. Acceptance of this
responsibility is essential to the educational process and must be considered
an expression of mutual trust, the foundation upon which creative scholarship
rests. Students are directed to use great care when preparing all written work
and to acknowledge fully the source of all ideas and language other than their
own."

Plagiarism or cheating of any kind will be met with a zero-tolerance policy.
All incidents of suspected cheating will be referred to your Associate Dean in
accord with Bucknell's Academic Responsibility policy.

Students are encouraged to visit the campus webpage for more information:

Students are required to read and consult "Citing Sources" Chapter 4 in The
Political Science Student Writer's Manual, Fourth Edition by Gregory M. Scott
and Stephen M. Garrison on the ISR e-reserve page for this course for
guidelines in citing sources for papers, projects, etc.

Make-up Exams and Late Assignments:  
If you have an unavoidable and extreme circumstance that will cause you to
miss a scheduled exam you MUST notify me and the appropriate Dean's office at
least 24 hours beforehand to schedule a make-up exam. Note that make-up exams
may include extensive essay questions. Late assignments will not be accepted.  
  
A Note to Students with Disabilities:

Course Assignments

American Politics Update: On Thursday of each week a group of students will be
responsible for updating the class with regard to the major happenings in
American politics. These groups will lead the discussion of current political
events by preparing a 5-10 minute summary of the major news stories of the
week and presenting it to the class. Non-presenting members of the class are
responsible for having knowledge of current events and formulating questions
for the presenting group. The presenting group will be evaluated in terms of
presentation content, discussion leadership and question answering. Group
members are charged with the responsibility of summarizing and presenting the
week's news, asking questions designed to lead discussion, and answering
questions from fellow students.

American Politics Research Journal: For each course topic you will be given a
general question to answer that will form some of the basis for our topic
discussion. You should research the answer to the question using your text,
readings, the web-resources I give you and any other materials you desire.
Write a 1-page journal entry detailing your answer and citing your sources.
Journals will be collected randomly so bring it to class. This journal project
is an attempt to connect real world American politics to your textbook.
studies.

Semester Essays (4): This course is divided into four sections: the
Foundations of American Politics, Representing the People in American
Politics, American Political Institutions and the American Policy Process. At
the conclusion of each section, you will be asked to write a short essay
(maximum 3 pages) that discusses the important elements of that part of the
course. The maximum page requirement should not be a false comfort to you. It
is often more difficult to concisely express important themes and ideas than
it is to go on about them at length. The culmination of these 4 essays should
provide you with a comprehensive record of what you have studied this
semester. In other words, they are not busy work. Rather, they are a way of
giving you the opportunity to stop, think and write about each section of the
course as a tool for helping you synthesize the large amount of information we
will be discussing.

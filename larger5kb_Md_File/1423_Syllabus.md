Overview of the Course:

_

This course provides an overview of contemporary international problems and
the means to analyze them. Considerable attention will be given to such
concepts as the nation-state, power, and influence, with a focus on foreign
policy decision making. We will adopt a social scientific approach as we study
contemporary global politics. This means we will consider the possibilities
for developing generalizations about international relations, identifying
patterns in the behavior of nation-states. Attention will be given to theories
that illuminate the operation of the international system and the behavior of
state and non-state actors.

This course will provide an introduction to the scholarly literature on world
politics, pointing out the strengths and weaknesses in that literature. While
our focus will be on tendencies and generalizations across cases, our
hypotheses and theories must have relevance to the referent world. A
familiarity with recent, especially post-World War II, history is essential
and will be a priority in this course.

We will attempt to delineate a general analytical framework for understanding
international relations, spending time examining contemporary national
perspectives of both developed and developing countries. While a good deal of
attention will be given to the interests and behavior of major powers (e.g.,
China, France, Russia, and the U.S.), we will also consider policy issues
involving a diversity of other states (e.g., Canada, Cuba, and Iran). Case
studies will be used to illustrate arguments. We will probe foreign policy
decision making through both crisis and non-crisis cases, examining the impact
of security problems of the nuclear era, not only tracing the past Soviet-
American arms race but also contemporary dilemmas of arms proliferation and
new complexities in efforts at arms control. We will examine the evolution of
the liberal international trading system and the economic challenges now
confronting the global community.

The disintegration of the USSR and the Soviet bloc, together with the
emergence of an increasingly integrated Europe and other regionally defined
economic blocs (e.g., NAFTA), signify fundamental change in the international
community. The Cold War has ended, but even the broad contours of a "new world
order" are unclear. The United States, among other countries, continues to
struggle in identifying its role in the wake of the ending of the bipolar
system. Examination of past, documented foreign policy problems is intended to
help course participants to think more rigorously about the range of important
issues now before the rapidly changing international community.

The overall objective of this course is to give students a sufficient
awareness of the range of factors influencing international relations to
permit a critical appreciation of the contemporary global environment and ways
of thinking about the future.

Course Requirements:

_

Student obligations for the course include, (a.) doing a lot of reading, (b.)
having the readings prepared _by the time_ they are due, (c.) taking two essay
examinations, (d.) completing a foreign policy paper, and (e.) participating
in class discussions.

I plan on bringing in material for each class session, though my desire for
this class is to proceed using a modified Socratic approach. Thus, I am
assuming there will be a good deal of discussion in each class session, with
class participants together reflecting over the issues that arise with the
schedule of topics and designated readings. Your attendance at all lectures
and discussion sections is _assumed_. I am looking forward to lively and
informed discussions, with all course participants sharing thoughts. Your
active contribution to our group deliberations will be a critical component in
the assessment of your participation grade. I reserve the right to
administratively drop any course member who misses three or more class
meetings.

The readings are critical to the course and will provide an appropriate basis
for our meetings. This course assumes no prior background on your part, so for
some of you this course is the first formal exposure to international
relations. This fact only reinforces the importance of the readings. Focus on
the concepts and theoretical concerns touched upon in the readings as you
develop your own intellectual compass for understanding contemporary
international issues. Note that _all_ readings listed in the Schedule of
Topics and Readings are required and will be tapped by the exams.

The final course grade will be determined on the basis of the following graded
components:

First Exam  | 25% | (Thursday, October 21)  
---|---|---  
Foreign Policy Paper | 30%  | (due no later than November 23)  
Second Exam | 25% | (Thursday, December 16, 11:00 a.m. - 1:00 p.m.)  
Participation | 20% |  
  
Please note that you must complete all three major written components to pass
this class. The _first exam_ will have both take-home and in-class components.
A broad essay question, worth 50% of the exam, will be given out during the
class meeting on Tuesday, October 19. It will be due at the beginning of the
next class meeting on Thursday, October 21. Thus, you will have 48 hours to
complete this part of the exam. The second part of the exam, consisting of one
or two essay questions, will be completed in class on that Thursday, October
21. Given that I will have little time to evaluate the second exam and turn in
final grades, that _second exam_ will be in-class; it is scheduled during the
final exam period (December 16, 11 a.m. to 1:00 p.m.). More specific
information on this exam, which also will be completely essay, will be
forthcoming. The dates and times for the exams are firm; makeup exams will
only be given in the most extraordinary, documented, circumstances. In
accordance with university regulations, I am not giving the second (i.e.,
final) exam at any time other than the officially scheduled final exam time
period.

The _foreign policy paper_ will involve your analysis of the state of
relations between the United States and some other nation-state (e.g., China,
France, Germany, Great Britain, India, Japan, Mexico, Russia, etc.), but with
your assessment being from the standpoint of that other nation-state. Thus, I
want you to assume that other country 's perspective, assess its view of the
current state of relations with the U.S., assess its ability to influence the
U.S. In essence, during the semester, you will be adopting another country and
tracking its foreign policy interests involving the U.S. You will want to
familiarize yourself with that country's background while focusing your
attention on current foreign policy developments involving that country. Your
foreign policy paper should reflect your thoughts and analysis of your chosen
country in terms of the concepts raised in class. It is expected you will
raise issues from your foreign policy case study during our class meetings.

The final version of the foreign policy paper, to be no longer than 8
narrative pages, and supported by the appropriate bibliographic information,
is to be turned in no later than Tuesday, November 23. A handout providing
further details regarding the foreign policy paper will be forthcoming. Note
from the Schedule of Topics and Readings that I will be organizing in-class
roundtable panel discussions for the last weeks of the class during which all
course participants will share the highlights of their semester-long foreign
policy paper project.

Writing standards are important in this course. Given the nature of our class
assignments, your ability to communicate clearly and concisely will directly
affect your grade. If you think your writing skills need serious improvement,
check with me so we can come up with an appropriate plan for addressing the
situation. You might want to consult William Strunk, Jr., and E. B. White,
_The Elements of Style_ (any edition). The technical aspects of written
communication are also important. Kate Turabian 's book, _A Manual for Writers
of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations_ (any edition), is one of the most
widely used and easily accessible guides available. I recommend you have this
or some other style manual in your personal library.

I would like to hear from any special needs students in this class who may
require some modification of the seating, testing, or other class
requirements. Please see me after class or during my office hours.

Please be aware that University of Arizona policies and rules related to
academic honesty and integrity apply to all work done in this course.

_Books and Course Materials to Purchase_ :

The following books are available for purchase in the ASUA and other
bookstores:

Karen Mingst, _Essentials of International Relations_ , N.Y.: W. W. Norton,
1999.

Thomas L. Friedman, _The Lexus and the Olive Tree_ , N.Y.: Farrar, Straus, and
Giroux, 1999.

POL 202H Coursepack

The Mingst volume is the basic textbook for the course. It provides a summary
overview of many theoretical and substantive issues with which we will be
dealing. We will be reading all of it. Friedman's book offers a lively
discussion of globalization and its implications for the current international
system, and it will serve as the major basis for our discussions during the
latter part of the semester. In addition to these texts, there are a number of
journal articles and book chapters which we will be reading. All of these
articles and chapters have been gathered together and made available through a
_coursepack_ , which is available at the ASUA Bookstore.

The Mingst and Freidman volumes and the coursepack include all of the readings
listed in the Schedule of Topics and Readings for the course. Note that the
books but _not_ the coursepack are on reserve at the Main Library.

We will be encountering a good deal of historical and case study background
material during the semester and, as a result, I encourage course participants
to use some type of world historical atlas as a quick reference to identifying
events, names, and other historical detail. I recommend _The Anchor Atlas of
World History_ , in two volumes (Volume I: From the Stone Age to the Eve of
the French Revolution; Volume II: From the French Revolution to the late
Twentieth Century), which contains hundreds of maps and literally thousands of
name and event citations. You may want to add this or some other historical
atlas to your personal library; it will come in handy in many settings beyond
our class. Check local new and used bookstores or visit Amazon.com or some
other internet site.

I strongly encourage every class participant to acquire the habit or cultivate
it if you already possess it of reading a major source of international and
national news daily (e.g., _The New York Times_ , _The Washington Post_ , _The
Los Angeles Times_ , etc.). You will be surprised how quickly you gain a
working knowledge of many international relations issues through such a daily
routine. You are likely to come across much current material that will be
relevant to our readings and class discussions. I highly recommend that you
take advantage of the on-campus, discount-price availability of _The New York
Times_ (the subscription price is approximately 40 cents per day compared with
the one dollar cost when you buy the paper at the news stand). Daily reading
of _The New York Times_ will undoubtedly help you to perform better in our
class. We will have subscription forms available from the local distributor,
Phoenix News Express. Note there is a _New York Times_ website (
**www.nytimes.com)** which contains major headline news stories and other
valuable supplementary information. The website version of _The New York
Times_ does not include all of the articles or the detail available in the
daily hardcopy. It does, however, have useful material relevant to our course
and I encourage you to take out a free subscription to this source while also
subscribing to the daily hard copy.

Sociology is the study of society.  
  It focuses on identifying, explaining, and interpreting patterns and processes 
  of human social relations.  This introductory course is designed not just 
  to teach you some of the major findings of sociology, but to help you master 
  fundamental sociological skills, including both the ability to think with a 
  "sociological imagination" and to master the basics of computer-based 
  data analysis--skills which have broad applicability in a range of educational 
  and work settings.  It is my hope that this hands-on experience of "doing" 
  sociology will both enliven your interest in sociological analysis and help 
  you develop practical skills that you can use in other contexts as well.

          this Box for Current Announcements
The 
          Fall 2002 version of this course will be largely the same, except that 
          there will be a new edition of Discovering Sociology.




Texts and Data Analysis Software:





Rodney Stark, 
      Sociology (Wadsworth, 8th edition, 2000).  Stark's is an 
      introductory text that strongly emphasizes the scientific ambitions of sociology.  
      Book 
      Website: (includes online quizzes and other resources for each chapter. 
      Virtual 
      Tours in Sociology (interactive explorations 
      of sociological materials on the internet).





Steven E. Barkan, Discovering Sociology: 
        An Introduction Using Explorit (1998).  With the MicroCase 
        software that comes with this book, you will master the basics of sociological 
        analysis and be able to explore many issues on your own.  You may 
        load the software on your own computer or access the program in the campus 
        computer labs. MicroCase 
        Resources (our department's page to support 
        MicroCase across our curriculum). 






This syllabus may 
  be accessed on the internet at http://www.camden.rutgers.edu/~wood/207syl.htm. 
    It contains hyperlink connections to readings,  online quizzes, 
  virtual tours, assignments, powerpoint slides, film clips and other resources.  
  New resources will be added to this syllabus periodically during the semester, 
  and so you are encouraged to check it regularly. Registration 
  at the New York Times website is required 
  to access some of the readings. 

Course Requirements:  You 
  are expected to attend class regularly, to keep up with the course readings, 
  and to participate, to the extent possible in a large class, in class discussions.  
  You are responsible for all material covered in class, including powerpoint-assisted 
  lectures, films, video clips, and computer-projected exercises in data analysis.





Exams

There will be 
          three closed-book, multiple-choice exams in this course, two during 
          the semester and a final.  Study Guides will be handed 
          out before each exam.  These three exams will make up 50% of your 
          grade.  Please note that if is your responsibility to contact 
          me the day of the exam if you are forced to miss it; you will otherwise 
          forfeit your right to take it.
Practice 
          On-Line Quizzes are available at the text website.  These 
          Chapter Tests provide a useful way of reviewing the text material.  
          Use of these online quizzes is voluntary, but some of the questions 
          will be incorporated into the in-class exams. 



MicroCase
            Exercises

You will be asked to complete 
          five computer-based assignments from the Discovering Sociology 
          workbook, using the Microcase Explorit data analysis software 
          that comes with it and which will also be available on the campus network, 
          accessible from the computer labs (click here 
          for instructions).   In addition, there will be a "Do-Your-Own-Exercise" 
          which will ask you to formulate your own hypothesis and test it.  
          The five exercises will count for 20% of your grade; the Do-Your-Own 
          Exercise will count for an another 20%. 
To get full credit, these assignments must 
          be handed in at the class for which they are assigned, and must 
          include a printout of the data for the final question.  
          Late exercises will be accepted, but will be penalized ten points.    
          You will be responsible for the material taught through the exercises 
          for the exams.
          Two student assistants,  
          Derrick Chin and Nakia 
          Reese, will be available to assist students with using the MicroCase 
          program and doing the various exercises.  Periodic lab hours will 
          be announced in class and in the Announcements box at the top of this 
          page. In addition you may email either of them to set up an appointment 
          as well. 



Sociology
            Virtual Tours 
          
In order to learn about 
          sociological resources on the web, you will be asked to complete two 
          "Virtual Tour" assignments.  These virtual tours ask 
          you to explore a variety of sociologically-relevant websites, many of 
          them interactive ones where you call up specific information and analyze 
          it, and then submit your results electronically.  You must complete 
          the Sociology 
          Virtual Tour: Doing Sociology on the World Wide Web, as well as 
          one of the virtual tours (other than Tour A) at the  
          Wadsworth Virtual Tour site.  These two exercises will together 
          count for 10% of your grade.  Please note: electronic submission 
          of your virtual tour answers constitutes a promise that you accessed 
          the sites and found the answers on your own. Plagiarism 
          here or elsewhere will be severely penalized.

This course is 
          based on the dual convictions that technology can enhance learning and 
          that learning to use technology effectively is a critical job skill 
          for the 21st century.  The use of computer technology will be an 
          important part of this course, both in the classroom, where internet 
          usage and powerpoint presentations will be common, and in your coursework 
          outside of class.  All out-of-class coursework can be performed 
          in one of the various computer labs on campus.  If you use a home 
          computer, it will be necessary to have the Adobe Acrobat and RealPlayer 
          plugins installed; most recent versions of browsers include them.

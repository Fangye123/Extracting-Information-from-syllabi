**GUIDE TO THE MATERIAL: ONE**  
**OVERVIEW**  
---  
  
**This site is the first is a series of course guides. They cover what we
would normally consider a "class lecture." However, due to class discussion,
special topics, or even intriguing tangents, I may not be able to cover the
entire planned lecture. Thus it is preserved and presented for you on a series
of class web sites and we will be able as a class to "forge forward." All
students are responsible for the information in the course guides.**

**NOTE: Italicized, underlined, and colored phrases are phrases you should
know!**  
  **WHAT ARE GROUPS?**  
---  
  
**Groups are one of the most "human" things about us. We are social animals*.
The impact of groups is present even when we are alone:**

  * **In our numerous "shoulds," "oughts," and "to-do" lists**
  * **In our self-identities and self-descriptions**
  * **In evaluating our performance**
  * **Often in our mood states**
  * **In literally setting parameters on how we perceive and conceptualize**

***Dogs, also "pack animals," are another story.**

**For good or ill, groups often accomplish goals that individuals cannot. As
_group members, we_ frequently behave in ways we do not as individuals. And
our behavior as group members may fluxuate from group to group.**

**For example:**

  * **As a union representative, I find that I am much more assertive than I am in my "other lives"**
  * **In his analysis of rape statistics over 20 years ago Wolfgang Kohler discovered that rape is frequently, if not predominantly, a "social crime," i.e., at least two men jointly initiate an assault**
  * **Mary Frank Fox tackled the "myth of the lone scholar." Instead of the scholar reading, thinking, analyzing, and writing alone, Fox finds science scholarship to be a highly social and joint enterprise**

**Not all collections of individuals are groups. The phenomena of cohorts,
aggregates and groups are often treated interchangably. This is a mistake
because groups have properties the other two entities do not. Further,
confusing, say, a targeted cohort with a crowd with a group only obfuscates
the differences among these concepts**

![](LilBackToTop.gif)  
**BEFORE THERE WERE GROUPS, THERE WAS SOCIAL FACILITATION**  
---  
  
**_Social Facilitation_ has become a "catchall" phrase that refers to the
effects of having other people* in one's immediate physical environment. The
work of Robert Zajonc (pronounced "Zy-ounce"), among others, indicates that
the _mere presence_ of other people is physically arousing. Borrowing from
several learning theories (especially that of the late Clark Hull), many
behavioral scientists assert that moderate amounts of physical anxiety enhance
performance. Many studies have found that _moderate_ amounts of anxiety
increase the drive or motivational component of the learning/performance
equation, thus enhancing the performance of the best-learned response.**

**Thus, we have studied _audience effects_ , where the actor is a performer
and the others are observers as well as _co-action effects_. _Co-actors_
_individually_ perform the same actions at the same time, typically in the
same place.**

**Both types of situations now would be defined as _aggregates_ (see below).**

**Think: group of students in a room writing an exam.**

***My favorite example of Zajonc's work involves audience effects with
cockroaches. I was privileged to observe first-hand several trials in his
studies. Cockroaches were trained to "run" toward a light in a clear lucite
t-maze. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to share a residence with
'roaches can testify that their normal mode is to AVOID light. An "audience
box" was located beneath the t-maze where the 'roach marathoners could see,
and presumably smell, their colleagues. 'Roaches ran the t-maze faster and
more accurately with an audience of their fellows than when no audience was
present.**

**In both audience and co-action effects, there is no real division of labor,
no coordinated cooperation, no sense of being in a group. Sometimes co-actors
are also in aggregates, however (see below). The arousal effects of having
others present may interfere with _learning_ even though they can benefit
_performance_.**

**As a consequence of his series of studies, Zajonc advises students to study
alone (rather than in the library or in a study hall) but to take an exam in a
group situation.**

**More seriously, we can apply some of this material to anger management
situations such as domestic violence. We know that domestic violence runs in
families, and that abused children are more likely to become abusers as
adults. This is often interpreted as a modeling or imitation learning
occurrence. But we can take our application of social facilitation a step
further:**

> **Much family behavior is typically private behavior, taking place "behind
closed doors." So our widest repertoire of family behavior and our best-
learned responses come from what we observed in our own families. Because of
privacy, we know little about the intimate lives of other families and media
present glossy or over-dramatized versions of family life. When disagreements
and conflicts erupt in families, emotions run high and everyone is in a state
of physiological arousal. That is _exactly_ the time when a well-learned
response is most likely to be performed. If that response is violent, its
probability of occurrence is enhanced.**

![](LilBackToTop.gif) **COHORTS VERSUS AGGREGATES VERSUS GROUPS**  
---  
  
**Members of a _cohort_ share at least one common characteristic or
experience. Demographers usually reserve the term for people who have a common
experience at a singular point in time, such as a birth cohort ("generation")
or students who entered Florida State University as freshmen in the Fall of
2000. But other examples include the Hispanic or "soccer mom" or "angry white
male" vote, i.e., collections of individuals with a common characteristic.
Members of a cohort may never meet one another, may never even be collected in
the same place, and generally do not think of themselves as "group members."
Members of a cohort may be quite diverse (are all soccer moms the same?)
because other characteristics or experiences cross-cut what they have in
common. However, cohort members may _self identify_ ("I'm a Generation Xer" or
"I'm the soccer mom"). This self-identification with a cohort can influence
behavior through collective identification. Politicians and market researchers
are well aware of cohorts, and use them to target segments of the population
for advertising and other persuasion campaigns.**

**_Aggregates_ are collections of individuals who are physically proximate at
the same time, such as several individuals in the Bellamy or Stone elevators
or a crowd at an FSU football game. Examples range from the audience effects
and co-action effects we saw in social facilitation above to research on
crowds and fads. Historical studies of riots and revolutions show that crowd
behavior can be the spark that topples governments or creates a night of
terror. There is at least the suggestion that rape, which is often a group
perpetrated event (think Central Park), may be an example of crowd behavior.
Studies of these events often reference the arousing effects of others, the
apparent normlessness of crowds, and the "confrontational nature" of the
events (i.e., spontaneous, unplanned, and immediate).**

**At times, aggregates may become groups. The elevator jams and those inside
turn to one another for support. Members of a crowd coalesce into
revolutionaries. But it takes more than just a bunch of people in the same
place to be a group.**

**Aggregates and cohorts do influence behavior . They are phenomena clearly
worthy of study--but they aren't groups, although they are sometimes confused
with groups. We need to separate these concepts carefully so that we don't
misapply them.**

![](imageH7O.JPG)   **Group or aggregate? We need more information here!**

![](LilBackToTop.gif) **NOW...WHAT _IS_ A GROUP?**  
---  
  
![](RugbyMatch.JPG) **Almost certainly a group (two groups actually). Why?**  


**Here are my keys to defining a group. They are parallel although not
identical to components that your texts mention:**

  * **(1) members have a self-definition as a group member**
  * **(2) members are identified _by others_ (other-definition) as a group member. It is especially important that they are identified as belonging to the group by other group members.**

**Both self and other definition as a member are necessary. Without self-
definition, we may need surveillance to keep the person in the situation
(think prison). At the least, the individual can end up enjoying the benefits
of the group without contributing (freeloaders) because s/he does not self-
define as a group member.**

**Without other-definition, an individual may be unable to enjoy any benefits
of group membership, including the prestige that may be awarded to members.
Group members may perceive the person as fraudulent and expel them. We may
create many distance mechanisms (such as ignoring the person, "rewriting
history" to exclude the individual from the group, or literally "cutting them
out of the picture.)**

  * **(3) Interdependent [common] goals that require coordination**

**Such goals can create a division of labor and specialized roles which may
then cause role conflict. If I had to select just one defining characteristics
of a group, _interdependence_ would be it. Interdependence means that people
cannot achieve goals individually, but must do so as group members. For
example, the faculty union can negotiate a contract covering the rights of
faculty generically, but an individual can only address their own case.**

**It is the interdependence, and the interlocking roles that result from
interdependence,   that melds people together into a unity. Interlocking roles
are either created by the group (in more informal groups) or form part of a
pre-existing structure (often in formal groups).**

  * **(4) A _common fate_. Both (3) and (4) imply commonality. A very important difference is that collectivities typically and actively choose their goals, doing so consciously as a group. A common fate may be _thrust upon individuals w_ ho are initially members of cohorts or aggregates rather than groups.**

**For example, American racial segregation was practiced by Whites toward
Blacks, regardless of whether the diverse Blacks involved had previously
formed groups or had common goals-- although many Black political
organizations formed _as a response_ to this common fate. Members of a
geographical neighborhood may face a wrecker's ball through "urban renewal"
simply because they live within a few square blocks of one another, although
this aggregate experience, too, may be an impetus to later group formation.**

![](LilBackToTop.gif)

**Other defining characteristics include:**

  * **(5) _Cohesiveness_**

**Cohesion has so many definitions that they would fill a book by themselves
as we shall see later this semester. The ancient 1968 Cartwright and Zander
definition was "the total forces attracting members to a group" (and keeping
them there). Beatrice Lott defined it as the number of ties among [individual]
group members. This has been the most widely used definition.**

**I define cohesiveness as a sense or spirit of _group unity_ , i.e., as a
group property, rather than some mathematical function of individual scores. I
have very strong feelings about this issue because I do take the gestault
position that "groups are real," i.e., have an existence that is more than
some mathematical function of the individuals within it. (More on this one
later.)**

  * **(6) " _Normative expectations_ ", i.e., rules regulating member behavior or how members "should behave"**

**Such norms provide predictable, stable group interaction. Groups that
provide norms and evaluate behavior are often called normative reference
groups or exerting normative influence. It is the absence of such normative
expectations that can produce the erratic, often frightening behavior we see
in crowds.**

  * **(7) Direct interaction among members. Ironically, this is the characteristic that typically comes to mind first. Actually it is not a necessary attribute! Many groups survive without it. Consider members of professional societies who may read journals but never or rarely contribute, so that the only one who _really_ knows about their existence is the society treasurer. Another example were the isolated Jewish families in Ethiopia, who kept ancient traditions alive for centuries but who may have rarely seen another Jewish family until their migration to Israel.**

* * *

  
  **ISSUES ONLINE**  
---  
  
**One modern innovation is "groups" that only communicate via the Internet.
These may be members of various chat rooms, listservs associated with
professional societies, or students all enrolled in a Distance Learning
course.**

**Experimentally, such "groups" are actually an old story. A common
experimental paradigm to assess the _effects_ of a group is to create a bogus
group that is accessed only through computer. In this way, feedback and other
information from "group members" to the naive participant can be arranged by
experimenters. Many studies show that "membership" in and feedback from these
contrived groups influences behavior, attitudes, and identity.**

**But are online groups really groups in the sense of the defining
characteristics listed above?REVIEW DEFINING CHARACTERISTICS HERE!**

**All research on online issues is in its infancy, for obvious reasons.
However, here are some factors to mention:**

  * **Many members of chat rooms are strongly emotionally involved with these chat rooms. This occurs both in Distance Learning courses and regular Internet "rooms." For example, I now work professionally with one scholar I have met only once--and that a year and a half after we began an online correspondence. Prior to our meeting, we had spoken twice on the telephone to set up the meeting. In a second case, I have become professionally involved with someone I met finally TWO years after our first online interaction--and that because I invited him to be a panel member at a conference based on our online interaction.**

**People marry others whom they have met online. Members of listservs conduct
lengthy and hot discussions on all kinds of topics. Online focus groups are
now a reality. All these examples argue that groups can and do form online.**

**However:**

  * **The lack of physical proximity lends a stilted and more formal quality to many online interactions that is atypical of groups meeting face-to-face.**
  * **People can, and, often do, misrepresent themselves online and there is often no way to establish the veracity of their assertions. This has led to tragedies such as individuals murdered by a "chatroom buddy". When I was a grand juror for over a year, we reviewed many cases where pedophiles misrepresenting themselves attempted to lure young children (typically young boys) into meetings. These misrepresentations would have been highly unlikely in other settings.**
  * **There is the "pull of the familiar" that can interfere with online group identification. One merely needs to leave the computer to do laundry, have a meal or chat with a spouse to "break the group spell."**

**From at least three national surveys released last year, we have learned
that online time eats most heavily into "TV time" rather than interaction with
relatives and friends (although there is some, more limited, erosion there).
Thus one potentially solitary activity is being exchanged for another rather
than previously social beings "morphing" into recluses. And, while it is true
that families or friends may watch TV together, online time is often more
active than passively watching a TV screen.**

**Dare I say: stay tuned?**

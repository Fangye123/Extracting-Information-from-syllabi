**CCHA-NEH Project Abstract**

##  World War II and Sixty Years Later:  
From VMail To EMail

![Uncle Sam](unclesam.jpg)**Project Description:** This project will partially
illustrate how humanities faculty can incorporate technology in classroom
delivery and course design. The techniques used in our project can be utilized
by others and hopefully will encourage faculty to try new technological
elements in their own teaching. The visual articulation of this project will
include classroom elements of a redesigned World War II course focusing on the
effects of the era on the average American that adds technology components to
the faculty delivery system, student research assignments with additional
student group projects.

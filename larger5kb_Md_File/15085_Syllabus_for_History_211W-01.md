Top GOALS: **ENCOUNTERING HISTORY**

    This writing intensive course serves as an introduction to American History at the college level. The purpose of the course is to enable you to use texts, documents, and secondary readings to understand the life experiences of ordinary people from different races and cultures.  And, to improve your ability to write analytically. We will explore how material conditions, that is, the environment, production and consumption of goods, and use of social space interacted with religious, political, and interpersonal beliefs to shape experience. Our goal is to arrive at an understanding of why and how life in the past differed from region to region and changed over time in the United States up to 1865.

    In addition we will examine the "construction" of history in three ways: one, by developing our own interpretations of primary sources; two, by discussing important and sometimes conflicting secondary works and thirdly, by evaluating primary documents on the World Wide Web.  In these ways, we can begin to see that history is an interpretation of the past shaped by the concerns of the present.

Top **REQUIREMENTS** _Class Preparation **:**_

The most important requirement for this course is a careful reading of the
assignments and thoughtful participation in class discussion and group
exercises. The assigned reading must be done before coming to class. To
prepare for class participation, the student should take notes on the reading
and develop questions for class discussion.  A Reading Analysis assignment for
each chapter (except 7 and 8) is due at the first class for each Topic.  The
assignments can be found on the Course WebPage. It is each student's
responsibility to get the assignment even if absent from class and to complete
it on time. Late assignments will not be accepted, however, each student may
omit two of the weekly assignments without penalty. There will be one mid-term
exam and one final exam. Attendance is required and more than two absences
will adversely affect your grade. Always bring **both** books and your notes
to class with you.

Top _Final Project:_

The final project is based on group work that will utilize primary sources and
the understanding of developments in American history gained during the course
to create a biography or community study of a real or imaginary historical
figure or place that will be presented in class. The final project can take
the form of a play, video, or a web page linked to the Course web site if
approved by Dr. Hunter well in advance. Detailed instructions will be provided
later in the semester.

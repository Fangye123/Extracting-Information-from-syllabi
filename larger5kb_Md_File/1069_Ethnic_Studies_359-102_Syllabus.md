John Boatman.

**OTHER COURSE REQUIREMENTS** :

Students will be expected to know the **general Ethnic Studies Concepts**
which are listed and defined in the text book Introduction.

Students will also be expected to know aspects of the history of selected
Ethnic Groups whose peoples settled in various regions of the United States,
including Wisconsin. This will include:

Unique facts about the homeland history of each of the Ethnic Groups. These
unique facts include special things that make the group different from all
other groups, as well as those things which make the group similar to other
groups.

**Why** and approximately **when** significant numbers of people from each
group left their homeland and came to the "Americas," including the United
States.

Significant, unique customs of these various Ethnic peoples and the
contributions they made to the United States "American" culture.

Students **will also be expected** to become geographically literate regarding
the selected Ethnic Groups. This will include:

Being able to **correctly locate, on an outline map of Europe or Asia or North
and Central America** , the **homeland of each of the Ethnic Groups** we cover
in this course.

Being able to **correctly locate, on an outline map of the United States** ,
the **major post-immigration settlement areas of various Ethnic Groups** we
cover in this course.

Being able to **correctly locate, on an outline map of Wisconsin** (on which
the counties are named and located) **the specific counties where significant
numbers of immigrants from various Ethnic Groups initially settled**.

Students will also be expected to **spell the official name of each Ethnic
Group correctly, as it is spelled in this syllabus**.

Each time on an exam that an Ethnic Group name is spelled incorrectly, the
student will lose 1/2 point for that particular answer.

**ATTENDANCE** :

I do **not** take or keep track of attendance. Class attendance is
recommended, however, because exams are based on the lecture material as well
as on the reading from the required book.

The classes for this course will begin promptly as scheduled. Please make
arrangements to **be on time** \- or - if you have a valid reason for
regularly being late, tell me about it!

**EXAMS** :  
  
There will be THREE scheduled exams during the semester AND a
**comprehensive** final exam during the Final Exam Period.  
  
Each of the first three exams will count 20% of the course grade. These exams
must be taken on the assigned dates, unless I approve an exception
**__before__** the date of the exam, or a student has a verifiable, written,
medical excuse.  
  
The comprehensive final exam will count the other 40% of the course grade.  
  
Note: Participation in or attendance at Athletic Events is **NOT** considered
to be a valid reason for missing an exam.

NO required papers to be researched and written in this course.

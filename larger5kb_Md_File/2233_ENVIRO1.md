**_Class Description_**

Taken in consecutive semesters and taught by the same team of instructors,
History/Political Science 15A/B fulfills the state of California's American
Institutions and Ideals code requirements for US History, US Constitution, and
California Government. When successfully completed, History/Political Science
15A/B counts for six units of General education requirements in Social
Sciences and Comparative Systems. Keep in mind that you must complete the
entire two-semester sequence in order to fulfill these requirements. Either
semester alone will satisfy none of these requirements. If you have already
taken Political Science 1 or Political Science 101, you may not take
History/Political Science 15A/B.

**POLITICAL SCIENCE**

The political science subject matter in this course has been designed as an
introduction to government through the study of political institutions in the
United States and California. A central component of the course deals with the
manner in which the government of the United States is now, and has been from
its inception, approaching a truly democratic system. We will devote
considerable attention to the political process as it has developed from
important underlying political theories to evolving and increasingly
democratic institutions. We will investigate the impact of social
participation in the United States and in California from a multicultural
perspective including the interaction between civil rights, civil liberties,
and linkage institutions. In so doing we will cover the development of public
opinion, gender relations, campaigns, campaign funding, interest groups, and
the process of policy formation and implementation. The course will encourage
critical thinking about these processes and their implications for the
American political system. In addition to the required readings, I will also
occasionally show videotapes that analyze and discuss political issues.
Students are responsible for reading, lectures, and all videotape material.

**HISTORY**

The historical components of this course cover the development of United
States history from the colonial period to the American Civil War. There are
of course many topics which can and will be covered in this class. They will
range from economics and politics to social movements, military history, and
others. However, the main emphasis will be to give the student a foundation of
information, including the basic facts and themes, which will allow him/her to
understand the important events in United States history and further his/her
studies with more in-depth investigations. We will be looking at the major
personalities, causes and affects, and historical facts which are relevant to
each major subject. We will also present both the conventional and alternative
interpretations of subjects whenever possible. Information will be presented
in a multicultural framework, including both conflict and consensus
perspectives of the choices and options available to individuals and groups in
their social, economic, and political relations. The focus will be on the
development of a multicultural society and the interactions, including
cooperation and conflict, as these many and varied peoples have dealt with
social, economic, and political issues.

**STUDENT LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

You will learn to analyze current social and political events, relate them to
their historical precedents and recognize the individual roles played by the
many elements that make up our diverse society. Through diverse reading
assignments, the text, and lectures, you will learn about American history,
government, and institutions from the nation's beginnings to our present
society. By the end of the two-semester course, you should be able to
recognize the key events and issues that formed the nation and be able to
explain the interactive role of those events in producing today's political,
social, and economic problems and institutions. Because History/Political
Science 15 A/B involves multidisciplinary material you will learn to draw from
a wide spectrum of sources for information and apply that information to
current political, economic, and social situations.

**Methods of Evaluation:**

1st Midterm - 100 points (Wednesday, October 4th)  
2nd Midterm - 100 points (Wednesday, November 15th)  
Final - 100 points

**Examinations**

Each examination will have an essay component and a multiple choice section.
The essay question will be randomly chosen from a short list of possible essay
questions that will be distributed one week prior to the examination.
Examinations will cover readings, lectures, and videotaped material. Any
student that engages in an act of Academic Dishonesty will receive an  "F" for
the course and will be referred to the appropriate campus official (see pp.
446, 447 catalogue). Students must take examinations on the day they are
scheduled. No makeup examinations will be administered without compelling
medical reasons and documentation. Crises, if they occur, must be communicated
to the professor before the examination. Makeups are not a right, they are a
privilege.

**Grading**

How your work will be judged and graded [What constitutes an A, B, C, D, F
grade]:  
90-100% = A range  
80-89% = B range  
70-79% = C range  
60-69% = D range  
0-59% = F range

**Mid-term Exams, Research Paper, Final Exam:**

## INTRODUCTION

This course adopts an interdisciplinary approach--drawing on cultural history,
anthropology, gender studies, and philosophy--to the study of Chinese science,
technology, and medicine analyzed in its intellectual, social, and cultural
context. The course is designed for students interested in i) the history,
philosophy and anthropology of science, technology, and medicine; ii) East
Asian studies; iii) studies of 'non-Western' cultures. We will also critically
assess the conclusions on 'culture' derived from the received historiography
on Chinese science, and examine emerging trends in current research. Knowledge
of Chinese is not required for the course.

## COURSE REQUIREMENTS

i) Class attendance is mandatory.

ii) Reading assignments: before class you must write a brief summary and
critique of the readings, to be sent to me by email. Notes on each of the
readings should usually be about two paragraphs--one summarizing the central
argument and one offering critical analysis--for a total of 2-5 pages per
week. These will be graded (distinguished, satisfactory, or unsatisfactory)
and will serve as the basis for class discussions. Students are encouraged to
rewrite the assignments on the basis of our class discussions.

iii) Final papers: Students must complete a 'think piece' as a final paper,
10-20 pages in length. (The reading notes should also help in writing the
final papers, but the final paper must not be a compilation of the reading
notes). Students with a reading knowledge of modern or classical Chinese are
encouraged to use primary sources in their final paper.

iv) Grading: final paper 60%; reading assignments 20%; class participation
20%.

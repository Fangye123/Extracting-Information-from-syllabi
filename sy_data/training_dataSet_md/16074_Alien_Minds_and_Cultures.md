### _**Readings:_**

To be provided by the captain (instructor) and fellow ensigns (students) in
the class.

### _**Course Description:_**

Are you a fan of Voyager? Would Deep Space Nine be your idea of an great
vacation spot? Only seen one episode of the original series? Whether you
consider yourself a Trekkie, Trekker, or neither, this course may be just the
break you need from your normal routine. Star Trek often deals with topics
from psychology, sociology, and anthropology such as sex, emotion,
communication, aging, prejudice, cognitive and emotional disorders, evolution,
and gender roles. In this course, we will examine the question of whether Star
Trek gets it right or is it more fiction than science. So bring your popcorn
and your human brains and we'll spend some time examining some of the
behavioral and social science principles underlying the world of Star Trek.

This course is also coded for the _Values_ goal in the General Education
program. _Values_ is defined as critical reflection on the attitudes and
beliefs relevant to individual and social choices and actions.

### _**Course Objectives:_**

  1. **Objective:** To become more knowledgeable about a variety of topics relevant to the behavioral and social sciences such as language and memory. To explore the strange, new worlds of scientific investigation which boldly engage the interest of psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists!

  2. **Objective:** To examine how these topics are commonly presented and addressed in a specific television genre - in this case, Star Trek. Is it more science or is it more fiction? Inquiring Star Fleet cadets want to know!

  3. **Objective:** To further develop analytic and critical thinking skills. Spock should serve as your role model for this course objective. You will analyze and evaluate each episode in relation to the research literature. Did Star Trek get it right or get it wrong or something in between?

  4. **Objective:** To further develop written and oral presentation skills. You will write an analysis of one episode per week based on readings and discussion, present the research concerning one episode and lead a discussion following that same episode. Certainly can't expect a Star Fleet commission without these skills!

  5. **Objective:** To further devlop library research skills. You will find relevant research articles to provide and present to the class. Learn to navigate the computor console and surf through the psychology databases much like Data!

### _**Class Meetings:_**

The class will meet on Thursdays from 17:30 hours to 21:30 hours (5:30 - 9:30
p.m. for those without Star Fleet Academy training). One should arrive on-
time, if not early, for all duty shifts and no duty shifts should be missed.
In other words, attendance is mandatory. Missed duty shifts (classes) will
negatively impact your performance log (grade) and also will be reported to
the Borg Queen. Don't let your collective down by missing your duty shift!

Less than 60| F | Unsatisfactory  
  
### _**Percent of Grade:_**

|  Away-Team Report | 20%

**Away-Team Report** \- Each week, we will view the historic video logs of two
Star Trek missions. Each video log highlights a specific alien mind/culture
concern. Away-teams (students, in groups) will be responsible for searching
the archives (library research journals - use at least one article from each
of the following sources: PsycArticles, PsycInfo, and Infotrac) for
information regarding this alien mind/culture concern. Away-teams will report
to the class on the specificied alien mind/culture concern as well as provide
relevant background readings. Away-team groups and mission topics will be
assigned the first week of class. Once you have your assignement, search the
archives! Get out your communicators and contact the captain (your
instructor). Discuss with her which articles you are thinking of distributing
to the class. Articles must be approved by the captain, and passed out the
week before your away-team report (except for first away team group).

Don't be reduced to this! Complete all mission analyses on time and
completely!

![](brainbegging.jpg)|  **Mission Analyses** \- As stated above, we will view
the historic video logs of two Star Trek missions each week. Ensigns
(students) are required to provide a written report concerning one mission
from each week. Each report will include a discussion of the material
presented by the away-team and the archival readings (journal articles). This
report will also include a discussion of the research concerning the specific
alien mind/culture topic and then analyze the historic video log (the Star
Trek episode) for inconsistencies and inaccuracies in terms of presentation of
this alien mind/culture topic. Each mission analysis will discuss whether the
historic video logs are accurate or whether the data has been
distorted/mispresented simply to manipulate the United Federation of Planets
populations' sentiments (ratings). Each mission analysis will include a
discussion of what was presented correctly and what was presented incorrectly.
While you are required to submit six mission analyses, only five will be
included in your final evaluation. Thus, the lowest grade may be dropped.

**Final Academy Quiz** \- A final quiz will be given covering all of the
material presented in class. Examination format will include multiple choice,
short answer, and matching. They will cover material from away mission reports
(presentations), archival readings (the journal articles), and discussion. The
final academy quiz will be worth 20% of your grade.  
  
---  
  
**Duty Shift Participation & Attendance** \- As discussed previously, duty
shift participation and attendance is mandatory. It is impossible to get the
full away-team report or to view the historic video logs in context if one
misses their duty shift. The technology presented to the right has not been
found to be as effective as full duty shift participation.|  |

![](uhura1.jpg)| Plagiarism (attempting to pass of the work of another as
one's own) is not acceptable and will result in a grade of 0 for that mission
assignment and will be turned over to Star Fleet Headquarters (the appropriate
university source) for disciplinary action.

## **Duty Roster**  
  
---  
**Red Alert!!!!  
There is no class the first week due to the professor's attendance and
presentations at the American Psychological Association Convention. She will
return to St. Louis at warp speed so that we can begin class on August 29 and
schedule a make-up class at that time.

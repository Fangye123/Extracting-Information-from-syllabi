Course Description: This course is a survey of the historical development of
psychology. The course information spans from early influences on psychology
to current fields in psychology. Topics that will be discussed include;
philosophical influences on psychology (e.g., the early Greek philosophers,
Empiricism, and Rationalism), the rise of experimental psychology (e.g.,
psychophysics), the official founding of psychology and early psychological
schools of thought (e.g., Voluntarism and Structuralism), early influences on
psychology as an empirical field (e.g., Charles Darwin), and current
psychological fields (e.g., Behaviorism). The prerequisite for this course is
PSYC1010.

Course Objectives: By the end of this course you should have an understanding
of:  
 1) The philosophical beliefs/schools of thought that influenced and
contributed to the development of psychology.  
 2) The point at which psychology became an independent field from philosophy,
and why psychology was considered an independent field at this point.  
 3) The early psychological schools of thought.  
 4) How the early psychological schools of thought influence present
psychological schools of thought.

Student Evaluation: Students will be evaluated on the basis of two semester
exams, a final exam, two papers, and in class quizzes.  
Exams: Exams will be multiple choice and short answer. The exams will not be
cumulative. Exam one counts for 20% of the final grade, exam two for 22% of
the final grade. The final exam counts for 20% of the final grade. Concerning
semester make-up exams: I will not give a make-up exam unless you have a
doctor's excuse. Make-up exams will be in essay form. All students will take
the final exam on the scheduled date and at the scheduled time. The final exam
for this class is scheduled for December 9th at 10:30AM. If a student misses
the final exam he/she will not be able to take the final exam. No exceptions
will be made to this policy.  
Papers: Papers will consist of an explanation of a historical theory (complete
with unique examples of the concepts presented) and a critique of the theory.
Papers should be approximately four to five pages long, typed (double spaced),
and in APA format. The topic for each paper should come from class material
discussed when the paper is due. For example, the first paper should discuss a
theory from chapter two, three, four, five, or six; the second paper should
discuss a theory from chapter eight, nine, ten, or eleven. Each paper counts
for 15% of the final grade (together they count for 30% of the final grade).
Papers are due on the date specified in the course schedule. Ten points will
be taken off the paper grade for each day the paper is late. For example, if
the paper is due on  Monday and is turned in on Tuesday, ten points will be
taken off the paper grade. If the paper is turned in on Wednesday, twenty
points will be taken off the paper grade. No exceptions will be made to this
policy. In addition, if you turn in the paper after I have left for the day,
the paper is late. No exceptions will be made to this policy. Late papers will
not be accepted one week after their due date and will receive a grade of
zero. For example, if paper one is due on Friday, October 16th, I will no
longer accept nor grade it on Friday October 23rd. No exceptions will be made
to this policy.  
Quizzes: There will be eight pop quizzes throughout the course of the
semester. Quiz questions will be definition and example questions, and will
come from information we have just covered (in the previous class), or
information we are about to cover (in the class that the quiz is given). The
quizzes will be given at the beginning of class. You will be given five
minutes to complete the quiz. If you miss a quiz (are late to class or are
absent on the day that a quiz is given) you may not make it up. No exceptions
will be made to this policy. Quizzes account for 8% of your grade.

The course grade will be derived as follows:  
      Exam One                     20%   
      Exam Two                    22%   
      Final Exam                    20%   
      Paper (15% each)         30%   
      Quizzes                           8% 

Grading: The grade ranges for this course are as follows:  
         90 - 100 = A                   79 - 89  = B   
         69 - 78  = C                    60 - 68  = D   
         59 or below = F   
I am very black and white with my grading. Black and white means that a 78.4
is a C, and a 78.5 is a B (with rounding up). I treat all students the same in
grading. In other words, I don't give "breaks" at the end of the semester.
Your grade is based solely on your performance on the exams, papers, and
quizzes. This means that every exam, paper, and quiz is important in that it
contributes to your final grade.

Other Class Policies:  
 -Cheating on any examination or quiz, and plagiarism on any paper is grounds for    immediate failure of the course.   
 -Turning in a paper from another course for this course is considered academic dishonesty,  and therefore grounds for immediate failure of the course.   
 -I may not be able to cover all the material that the text covers in class. You are still   responsible for that material.   
 -It is your responsibility to get the notes if you miss class. You may not get the notes from  me, you must get them from one of your classmates   
 -If you miss class, and wish to talk to me about what was covered in class, get the notes   first. If you have any questions about the notes come see me. I will answer specific   questions about the notes but I will not repeat the lecture for you individually. 

Other Notes:  
 -If you have trouble with the material, or an exam, come see might right away. Do not   wait until the final exam to tell me that you are having trouble with the material, it  will be too late!   
 -When studying for exams, do not just memorize the material, apply it. This will lead to    deeper processing, better understanding, and better recall of the material

Paper EvaluationArea/Percent of Grade  
Summary of Theory:  
     1) Completeness (15%): Is there enough information so that the reader can understand the theory   
      presented?   
     2) Clarity (10%): Is the information presented in a clear, concise manner?   
     3) Organization (10%)   
Reasoning/Logic in strengths/weaknesses/suggestions for change:  
     1) Strength of Arguments (20%): Are arguments explained, "backed up" with unique   
    examples/points?   
     2) Clarity of Arguments (10%): Is the information presented in a clear,  concise manner?   
    3) Organization of Arguments (10%)   
Understanding of Theoretical concepts (20%)  
     Is  understanding of the theoretical concepts evident through explanations, arguments, and unique   
    examples given?   
APA Style (5%): Citation style, citing when appropriate, running head, etc..  

APA Style 1\. The paper should be typed and double spaced. Double spacing
should appear throughout the paper (i.e., no triple spacing between
paragraphs).  
2\. You should cite the authors of your text when presenting/explaining
theoretical concepts. For example, the author of your text is Hergenhan,
therefore citation style would be - (Hergenhan, 1997). If you are quoting from
the text, you should include the page number in your citation. For example -
(Hergenhan, 1997, p. 58). If a statement in your paper is -According to
Hergenhan, you should include the year of publication after Hergenhan. For
example - According to Hergenhan (1997), Aristotle's theory.....  
3\. Include a running head on each page of your paper. A running head is a
shortened version of the title of the paper. For example, if the title of your
paper is A Critique of Aristotle's Theory, your running head may be
Aristotle's Theory. The running head should appear in the top right hand
corner of each page. The page number should immediately follow the running
head.  
Other Requirements/Suggestions  
\--Your title page only needs your name on it. In other words, you do not need
to have a formal title page. Your name should appear only on your title page,
and on no other pages in the paper.  
\--DO NOT QUOTE . If you quote that indicates to me that you do not understand
the concepts you are presenting. If you understand the concepts you should not
have to quote.  
\--Use examples. Provide your own examples of concepts in the explanation
portion of the paper. Back up your critique arguments with several examples.  
\--Conciseness: Express yourself in the simplest, shortest manner possible.

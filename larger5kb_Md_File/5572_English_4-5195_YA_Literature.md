  ** _SYLLABUS_** _While this syllabus is carefully planned, it may be
modified at any time in response to the needs and interests of the class, and
it is quite likely to be augmented with additional links and further details
of daily class activities.   Although you should have all readings prepared
exactly as described (i.e., completed before the class is scheduled to discuss
them), you should also be ready to make careful note of any changes made in
response to the needs and progress of the group.  It is your responsibility to
be prepared by checking the online syllabus regularly and, should you have to
miss a class, by calling one of your colleagues to catch up on the discussion
and to ascertain that no schedule changes have been made in your absence._

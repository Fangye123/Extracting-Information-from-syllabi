A man said to the  
universe:  
"Sir, I exist!"  
"However," replied the  
universe,  
"The fact has not created  
in me  
A sense of obligation."  
\--Stephen Crane, _War is Kind_ (1899)

"Mine and yours;  
Mine, not yours.  
Earth endures;  
Stars abide--  
Shine down in the old sea;  
Old are the shores;  
But where are old men?  
I who have seen much,  
Such have I never seen.

"The lawyer's deed  
Ran sure,  
In tail,  
To them and to their heirs  
Who shall succeed,  
Without fail,  
Forevermore.

"Here is the land,  
Shaggy with wood,  
With its old valley,  
Mound and flood.  
But the heritors?--  
Fled like the flood's foam.  
The lawyer, and the laws,  
And the Kingdom,  
Clean swept herefrom.

"They called me theirs,  
Who so controlled me;  
Yet every one  
Wished to stay, and is gone.  
How am I theirs,  
If they cannot hold me,  
But I hold them?"

"Earth Song" from _Hamatreya_ , Ralph W. Emerson

**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

This one semester graduate readings course will introduce environmental
history as an academic discipline. The course will emphasize the study of
people in Nature through time; and how people have responded to environmental
change, caused both by themselves and other forces in nature. Ultimately, the
course will provide a means of analyzing and understanding historical
environments.

The required texts (Marius's aside) pertain to several aspects of
environmental history and you are expected to have these texts read prior to
discussion dates. Refer to the course calendar for the respective dates and be
prepared to discuss the books during the class period. I expect informed
discussion of the books and a percent of your grade is based on how well you
participate in class.

I will assign to you a book from a reading list, which follows each assigned
text. On the discussion days for these books you will have prepared a 2-3 page
typed review of your book, and have made copies of the review for your
classmates and me. Your reviews will be graded and form a percent of your
final course grade. You will be expected to follow the book review guidelines
in Marius, A Short Guide to Writing about History. Read carefully chapter 7,
"Book Reviews", and follow Marius's recommendations in writing your own book
reviews. In your review, please include excerpts from book reviews in at least
two professional journals in order to give your classmates an indication of
how well scholars have received the book. In addition, please give a full
bibliographic citation of your book along with the call number of it.

Your end of class project is to complete a 12 to 15 page comparative book
review essay of four books, two of which may be taken from the required texts
or books that you reviewed from the reading lists, and two books that you have
not reviewed taken from the reading lists or the supplemental bibliography.

Late written assignments and unexcused absences from class will automatically
be given zeros. Only substantiated, or documented, absences will excuse you
from missing any scheduled assignment.

Good writing is essential to history. You will be responsible for reading
Marius, A Short Guide to Writing about History, and using it as the course
writing standard. Familiarize yourself with chapters 8  & 9, which cover
writing style and conventions. Pay particular attention to chapter 1, and the
ten criteria for a good essay, when you write your comparative book review
essay.

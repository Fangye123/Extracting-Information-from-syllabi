##  David Ribar, Associate Professor

David Ribar joined the Department in 1996. He received his Ph.D. in economics
from Brown University in 1991. His general research interests are in the areas
of labor economics, demographic economics, and applied microeconometrics. More
specifically, his research has focused on the relationship between women's
child care and work behavior, the determinants and consequences of adolescent
childbearing, and the motivations behind public and private assistance to the
poor.

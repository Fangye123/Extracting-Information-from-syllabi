**Course Description**  
  
This proseminar considers four decades of New World landscapes in various
media, with an emphasis on painting and photography. Scholars have long
understood the tradition of American landscape as having reached its zenith
during the middle of the nineteenth century. This course will investigate the
often overlooked ways in which artists during the final decades of the century
trenchantly analyzed prevailing conventions or experimented with alternatives
to them. The course will be less concerned with the general development of
tonalism, American impressionism, or other mainstream movements, and more
concerned with marginalized, idiosyncratic, or fugitive strategies for coping
with the failure of certain conventions to accommodate historical
circumstances and expectations.

**Requirements**  
  
Each student is required to attend class, do the readings on time, participate
in discussions, make an oral presentation, and write a research paper of
approximately 20 pages. The research paper will be due on May 3rd at 5 pm. No
extensions will be granted.  
Grades for the course will be determined in accordance with the following
table:  
  
Class attendance and participation 30%  
Oral presentation 20%  
Term paper 50%

**SS2104    Contemporary World History**

![](GreatWave.jpg)  [CHRONOLOGY,
1688-1995](http://dibner.poly.edu/digital_library/tmp/151.204.199.98_09_07_00_13_17/chronology%20routing.htm)  
Professor Soffer put together a chronology of world history.  It includes
links to short pieces on particular events or people, and some primary souces.
You might find it helpful.  Don't be confused by the "Back to Syllabus" link.
That is Professor Soffer's syllabus, not ours.  |   [Internet Modern History
Sourcebook](http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/modsbook.html)  
Many of our primary sources come from here.  There are many, many others and
also links to sources on East Asian history, Indian history, Women's history
and others.  It is a very nice browse.

**Dec. 6th.**   Taiwan was under control of Imperial China until 1895 until
the Japanese took over.  After 1945 the GMD controlled the island.  At first
the native Taiwanese welcomed the GMD, but when GMD officials simply replaced
Japanese officials rather than filling the position with Taiwanese there was
opposition to the GMD.  The GMD responded by massacring thousands of
Taiwanese.  See britannica.com article
[Taiwan](http://www.britannica.com/bcom/eb/article/8/0,5716,115301+1,00.html)

And here is an on-line biography of Hitler:

biography](http://www.historyplace.com/worldwar2/riseofhitler/index.htm)

As you work on your papers this weekend use the web to gather evidence for
your thesis and to strengthen the argument in your paper.  You might take a
look at articles on Hitler, Nazism, and World War II on the Encyclopedia
Britannica, for example.  You will find this at our library's online site.
Look at general reference under on-line resources.

**Nov. 15th   **Your second papers are ready to be picked up in Room 13, on

Note also that there will be no class next Wednesday.

**Nov. 8th**   Exams are ready to be picked up.  They will be in a box in Room
213 which is open all day.  The box in on the table to the LEFT when you walk

Paper topic:  **How did Nazism, a militaristic, racist and totalitarian
political ideology, come to control Europe between 1941 and 1945?   Consider
the different factors that account for its rise to power (economic, political,
social, a matter of personality).**  Make sure you have a thesis.  This could
take the form of arguing that one factor was more important than another, that
there were special circumstances that caused several factors to work together,
that Nazism was unique in history, or that it might happen again.  Think
things through on your own and be creative.  How good your paper is depends on
how convincing your argument for your thesis is.  This includes the evidence
you provide.  There is not one correct thesis (although there are ones that
would be very hard argue).  Make sure you draw on lectures, the film, reading,
and class discussion.

Next Wednesday I will ask you for  the material you have gathered together in
notes  
to argue your thesis and for an outline of how you will argue it.  Monday,
November 27th, after Thanksgiving,  the paper will be due.  Please use the
writing center and come see me to talk about the paper or to review drafts of
the paper.

**Oct. 23rd** Here's a message from our guide at the Metropolitan. Please go
web surfing at the Met website and look at what she has suggested.  She'll be
providing us with a list of dynasties and a map during the tour.  Use the tour
to help memorize the dynasties we have been learning about!

**"If your students want to familiarize**  
**themselves with some of the kinds of items we'll be looking at, I suggest
they visit the Met's website (**[www.metmuseum.org](www.metmuseum.org) **) and

**Oct. 9th   **Please note the second paper assignment which is due next
Wednesday, October 18th.  It is not as demmanding as the first paper and will
be drawn from your reading notes.  I will collect your reading notes on
Ocotober 16th (for Spence, Hobson, and McNeill) and there will also be a quiz
on Monday.  You might want to make a xerox of those portion of your notes that
relate to the question you choose to answer in the paper, or better yet, have
a rough draft of the paper done by Monday and use Tuesday to polish it.
Please try to read as much of the McNeill as you can by tomorrow, but I
wouldn't require you to have read it all since you just received the xerox
today.  Note that you do not have to read the first chapter (my xeroxer gave
you an added bonus!).  
**Oct. 2nd**   The class did not do too well on the quiz.  I'd like you to
start taking focused notes on the reading.  Please take notes to help you
answer the discussion questions.  You do not need to have a complete written
answer to each discussion question, but you should come prepared to answer
them in class.  I will collect your reading notes periodically so you need to
treat taking notes as an assignment that will be handed in.  
**Oct. 1st**   Please take a careful look at the syllabus. It has changed.
Tomorrow we are continuing to talk about the _Communist Manifesto_ and the
modern corporation.   We will begin talking about China on Wednesday.  I have
changed the museum date again (!) because of the career fair.  We will go to
the Met on October 25th and meet there at 10:45 am.  **The midterm will be
moved to October 23rd, one class earlier.**   Please keep up with the Spence
reading.  There are days when it is alot so try to get ahead.  
**Sept. 25th   **The Chandler reading (excerpts from the _Visible Hand)_ is in
front of my office door (201A).   In answer to the question about how large
the first emperor's army of lifesize clay soldiers are: much greater than the
size of a football field and archaeologists are still uncovering more finds.
Take a look at this article [Clay
soldiers](http://www.travellady.com/articles/article-xian.html) .  On labor
laws:  unions were legalized in Britain in 1825, but they could be charged
with conspiracy until 1871 if they enforced agreements among members on
working hours and wages.  See  [labor
laws](http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/07134.html) .  
**Sept. 24th**   Please read this excerpt from the _Communist Manifesto_ (the
final section of Part II, Proletarians and Communists) [Communist Manifesto,
excerpt2](ComManif.htm) I've put it in the syllabus along with the other
excerpt.  Please do your assignments from the on-line syllabus rather than one
you have printed up.  The syllabus will change and evolve.  
**Sept. 20th**   Note that the trip to the Metropolitan Museum will take place
on October 18th rather than October 4th.  I have changed it in the syllabus.
Please send me an e-mail if you cannot make it to the museum by 10:15 am.
I'd like you all to send me e-mails so I can  make up a class address book,
and I'd like you all to feel free to ask me questions via e-mail or send me
thoughts and suggestions regarding the reading, lectures, or other aspects of
the class.  Please let me know if you do not want your thoughts posted on this
website.  I would like to post any e-mail discussion we have.  
**Sept. 18th** The paper is due on October 2nd, NOT September 25th.  For those
of you are having trouble with the vocabulary of Dickens there is a student
edition of Dickens that has extensive vocabulary help.  You should be able to
find this at the New York Public Library or at Barnes and Noble.  A
suggestion:  **don't use an on-line dictionary**.   They are much slower than
a paper copy.  Buy a Meriam Webster paperback dictionary and keep it by your
side.  Please come in and see me if you are having trouble with the reading.
If you can not make my office hours we can set up a separate appointment.  I'd
like to have all of your e-mails.  **Please send me an e-mail so that I can
make note of your address.**

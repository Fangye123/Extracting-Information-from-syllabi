* * *

**Course Objectives** :

1\. To familiarize you with some of the important works of world literature
from the late 17th century to the present.

2\. To help you learn to read these works in social, political, and historical
context.

3\. To help you learn to become an attentive and thoughtful reader of literary
texts.

4\. To provide you with some background for further literary study.

* * *

**Course Requirements** : Regular attendance; regular preparation of reading;
2 tests, which will include either quotation identification or essay questions
or both; one short paper; and a final exam with both quotation identification
and an essay.

* * *

**Grading Policy** :

Tests and papers: 60%

Participation: 15%

Final: 25%

* * *

**Attendance Policy** : Regular attendance is required. Because it is unlikely
that you will be able to pass the tests without attending class, you may miss
no more than 4 classes without your grade being affected adversely.

###

**Academic Honesty:**

Cheating, including but not limited to plagiarism, will result in an F for the
course, and the filing of charges with the Office of Judicial Affairs, at the
very least. Please familiarize yourself with the code of conduct regarding
academic honesty.

  
  

|

### **A word about reading:**

The major work of this course involves reading, and there is a substantial
amount of it. Department policy states that the amount of reading you can
expect in World Literature courses is about 800-1000 pages. Because the
reading load is substantial, if you believe that you will be unable to keep up
with the reading, you may want to consider taking this course at such a time
as you will be able to keep up. Furthermore, reading literature is not like
reading a textbook; it requires time for reflection and, often, re-reading.
For department information regarding what is taught in World Literature
classes, please visit the World Literature Web Page at

## Tentative Syllabus

  

#### **

N.B. I reserve the right to make changes, including additions to or deletions
from the syllabus. You are responsible for these changes.**

### Internet Resources

I have attempted to make this syllabus as richly interactive as I can by
providing useful internet links in the body of the syllabus. Though it is no
substitute for the [library](http://www2.gasou.edu/library/), the internet
contains much useful information for the study of World Literature. A general
guide to humanities research, [The Voice of the
Shuttle](http://vos.ucsb.edu/), is also a good place to begin looking for
information that may complement, supplement, and enrich your reading of the
texts. I encourage you to take advantage of the links I have provided and hope
that they will help you gain a fuller experience of the reading. **

NB: The internal links here are meant to provide supplementary information to
help you put the reading in context or to provide you with study guides. I am
in the process of checking and updating the links. If you find any broken
links, please email me with the broken urls

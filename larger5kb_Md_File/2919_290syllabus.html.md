**Course description:**      An introduction to the history of cities and
buildings throughout the world, from earliest times to the present. Emphasis
will be on developing analytic skills rather than on the memorization of names
and dates.

**Course objectives:**      To gain familiarity with different building
traditions across time and diverse cultures, and to develop skills in
understanding architecture, the basic elements of structure, the design and
purpose of architecture, and its meaning and power.  

**Course requirements:**

  * Lectures/discussion: Typically two lectures and one open discussion meeting per week. Attendance is strongly advised. 
  * Exams: There will be two midterms scheduled during the regular class hours, each worth 40% of the final grade. Although these will emphasize material covered since the previous exam, they will draw on understanding and skills acquired throughout the quarter. An optional final will be held at the scheduled exam time; students choosing to take the final may substitute their grade on it for the lower of their midterm grades. The final can also be used as a makeup for a missed midterm. The remaining 20% of the final grade will be based on participation both in class and in the open fora on the Web. 
  * Forums: Students will be asked to post electronically on the Web their responses to questions raised for weekly discussions at a minimum of twice throughout the quarter. See p. 6 of the syllabus for further information. 
  * Field Studies: Also required are two field studies of buildings in Seattle which will serve as a point of departure for discussion on the Web. All students are expected to participate in these discussions. See p. 6 of the syllabus for a further description. 

**Web site:**      Many though not all of the slides used in class will be
available on the World Wide Web, accompanied by questions for study and
review. In addition, the Web will be used as a site for an open forum, where
students will post their responses to questions for discussion. For those
students unfamiliar with the use of computers, a guide for accessing this
material follows the Class Schedule. URL is:

post his/her responses to the two Field Study assignments (see "Field Studies"
below) and a minimum of two class discussions throughout the quarter.
Occasional in-class discussions will be based on questions available
beforehand on the course Web site. Responses need to be posted prior to the
day of the discussion in class in order to serve as the basis of discussion.  
  
Instructions for accessing and using the forums (newsgroups) will be
forthcoming and will be available on the course Web site.  
  
URL:<http://weber.u.washington.edu/~ah290/>  
  
  
  
**FIELD STUDIES**  
  
All students are expected to make two field trips on their own: one to the
Seattle Art Museum downtown, and a second to the St. Ignatius Chapel on the
Seattle University campus. These on-site studies will serve as the basis for
two electronic discussions (see  "Forums" above). Specific questions and
issues to be addressed in these discussions will be posted on the course Web
site.  
  
Due dates:  

  * Seattle Art Museum Field Study: student responses must be posted by Friday, October 17th. 
  * St. Ignatius Chapel Field Study: student responses must be posted by Friday, December 5th. 

  
  
  
**SAMPLE EXAM QUESTIONS**  
  

The comparisons below represent the types of questions you should be prepared
for on an exam in this course.

What is being evaluated is your ability to think critically about the material
we've studied, not to memorize facts. The basic information of name of
building, place, date, and architect (if known) will be provided for you. All
examples are drawn from the Kostof text.

  
  
I. Temple of Amon, Karnak, Egypt, c. 1525-1512 BC  
  
Temple of Apollo, Corinth, Greece, 6th c. BC  
  
Comparing these two buildings, how have different religious traditions
affected the architectural form?  
  
  
II. Pantheon, Rome, 2nd c. AD  
  
Hagia Sophia, Istanbul, 532-37  
  
Both are religious structures, one of the second century, the other of the
sixth century. For all their differences, they have several things in common.
How do they compare specifically in terms of:  
1\. Plan  
2\. Structure  
3\. Lighting  
4\. Function  
  
  
III. Agora, Athens, Greece  
  
Forum, Rome, Italy  
  
Both are urban open spaces developed for much the same purpose. How do they
compare in terms of their layout, and what does this say about the differences
in the two societies and how they used these spaces?

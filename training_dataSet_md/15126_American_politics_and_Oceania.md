## American politics and Oceania

    In teaching international law, I learned of Kurt Gaubatz' coursepage
    (http://www.stanford.edu/class/ps142k/ps142k.htm).  One of the interesting
    cases he lists there is a connection to the Oceania website.  Oceania is a
    project to build a new country out in the ocean.  The project promoters have
    written a libertarian constitution for their planned country.  Kurt offers
    excellent questions about the international legal issues that might be
    associated with such a new entity--it led to a solid hour of fine discussion
    in my class. If you're interested in getting to Oceania without going
    through Kurt's fine course page, then use: http://www.oceania.org
    
    I got to thinking after the international law class, that it might be fun to
    have my American government students compare the idea of liberty in the
    Oceania constitution to that in the US Constitution.  It succeeded more than
    I imagined it would.  Students noted that the Oceania constitution was a
    reaction to perceived failures in the US Constitution, and this seems to
    have interested them.  I just emailed Kurt on what they did with the
    assignment, and thought the members of the list might find this useful, as well.
    >
    >20 of my 75 students in American government tried the "compare the concept
    of liberty in the constitutions of Oceania and the US" exercise.
    Here is the wording of the assignment from my syllabus:
    Both the US Constitution and the proposed constitution for Oceania are
    concerned with individual liberty.  Oceania puts this as the highest aim of
    their proposed country, the US Constitution is more cautious, because the
    Framers were interested in being able to govern as well.  What is the nature
    of liberty expressed in these two documents?  How does a constitution
    contribute to the exercise of liberty?  How does a constitution modify
    liberty?  I suspect you will have a lot to say, if you do this project, so
    let's set the essay pages at 3-5.    
    [A NOTE on the exercises: I decided to let them do some picking and choosing
    about their grade.  I put 11 exercises and three exams in the course.  One
    exam is worth 25% of their grade, 2 exercises equal 25%.  I told them to mix
    and match as they please.  I imagine the bulk of them will choose three
    exams and two exercises, but this remains to be seen.]

    Results, in no particular order:
    >What was striking about their writing was how so many of them suddenly got
    the idea behind constitutionalism.  This is new stuff to them and they
    seemed quite amazed and taken with this.  Who'd a thunk it?  
    >
    >A small number of them noted that private power might become so suffocating
    that no one would really have any liberty.  Some skirted (none hit it
    really) the difference between freedom and license, though a number said
    they might like to visit a place where they can do whatever they want,
    pretty much.  This was a  "nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to live
    there" kind of argument.
    
    A fair number noted that if you maximize individual liberty, you minimize
    government power.  This is a trade-off I have tried to show my students in
    the past with little success; the comparison assignment seems to have solved
    that problem.  Most though certainly not all decided that taxes were not
    such a bad thing after all, especially if you wanted the government to be
    able to do something.  The Oceania constitution does not allow the
    government to tax; it relies on fees from court activities (you use a court
    in Oceania you have to belong and/or you pay a fee if you bring suit and
    lose) and on donations. Some commented on whether it made sense to equate
    political liberty with market-based "ability to pay."  In this regard, some
    of my students were uncomfortable with the Oceania idea that a hospital
    would keep a person on life support as long as there was money to pay for
    it. Once the cash ended, the hospital could pull the plug.
    >
    >A few noted that the Framers were creating the US Constitution in the
    context of an existing society and set of governmental rules, while the
    Oceania advocates were imagining rules for a place with no history or
    society.  If students went down this track, they generally concluded that
    the Oceania constitution lacked any sense about actually governing a
    community.  
    >
    >A few worried about the difficulty of amending the Oceania constitution.
    They wondered if that constitution would permit changing notions of liberty
    to be accommodated.  Some broached the problem that listing mays and may
    nots of the government and the natural/corporate citizens so extensively
    might end up limiting freedom. [The Oceania constitution is 54 pages long to
    accommodate all this listing.] Others said the combination of such detailed
    lists of mays and may nots plus the odd ways of changing the rules would end
    up thwarting liberty and might even end up choking off speech.
    
    A number of students said that they had never thought about liberty prior to
    the assignment.  Normally, I would take that with the proverbial grain of
    salt, but their papers suggested this really WAS thought-provoking for them
    
    I also found that I could refer to an Oceania rule in explaining a US
    Constitutional choice and get good results.  Students might even come back
    with another example where Oceania's constitution would produce one result,
    while the US Constitution would produce another.  They have actually talked
    to me about the assignment outside of class and I overheard them arguing
    about it with each other.

    >I may well move this from an optional assignment to a required one,
    especially if it turns out that students who did this one also tended to do
    better than the average on the first hourly exam.

---  
  
This page describes the requirements and other details for the Spring 2002
offering of Linguistics 001: Introduction to Linguistics at the University of
Pennsylvania. Specific questions should be directed to Prof. [Gene
Buckley](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~gene). See also [other
courses](http://www.ling.upenn.edu/undergrad/ugrad.html) in linguistics. (Note
that the organization of this course is different from the [Fall
2001](/courses/Fall_2001/ling001/) offering.)

The other basic page for Ling 001 is the [course schedule](schedule.html),
which includes links to the on-line lecture notes and the homework
assignments.

* * *

Ling 001 is a general introduction to the nature, history, and use of human
language, speech, and writing. It is appropriate for any Penn undergraduate
interested in language or its use. Topics include:

  * sounds, forms, and meanings in the world's languages 
  * the biological basis of human language and other animal communication systems 
  * relations of language to cognition, communication, and social organization 
  * spoken versus written language 
  * the reconstruction of linguistic history and relatedness among languages 
  * dialect variation and language standardization 
  * language and personal identity 
  * language learning by children 
  * the neurology of language and language disorders 

The course has no prerequisites, and satisfies the [General
Requirement](http://www.college.upenn.edu/requirements/general.html%0Ageneral_requirement.html)
in Living World (Sector V). Although intended for a general audience, Ling 001
is also recommended as an introduction for students who plan to major in
linguistics.

**Readings**  
---  
  
There are two required texts, available at the [Penn
Bookstore](http://www.bkstore.com/upenn/) (at the corner of 36th and Walnut
Streets).

  * [The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language](http://www.mit.edu/~pinker/tli.html), by Steven Pinker, c. 1994, Perennial Classics edition published 2000. 
    * Also on reserve at [Rosengarten](http://www.library.upenn.edu/services/reserves/res-vanpelt.html?vanpelt), in an edition with different page numbers from those indicated in the syllabus (but the chapter content is the same); call number P106 .P476.
  * [The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Language](http://www.cup.org/ObjectBuilder/ObjectBuilder.iwx?ProcessName=ProductPage&Merchant_Id=1&product_id=0-521-55967-7&origin=search&searchField=TITLE&searchString=encyclopedia%20of%20language) (2nd edition), by David Crystal, Cambridge University Press, 1997. 
    * Same edition available in the [Reference Department](http://www.library.upenn.edu/services/reference/ref-vanpelt.html?vanpelt) at Van Pelt (rather than in Rosengarten), under call number P29 .C64. Note that the edition used in this course is quite different from the 1st edition, so you won't be able to use an older copy of the book. 
  
  
**Requirements**  
---  
  
You are expected to do the assigned readings and regularly attend lectures and
recitations, since these are necessary for you to understand the material
tested by written work. There are three kinds of assignments that will be
graded.

**Homework**

> There will be frequent homework assignments (handed out most Wednesdays, due
the following Wednesday in class); they give practice in applying the
principles studied in class and in analyzing particular linguistic phenomena.
They are graded on a scale of 0-10. When possible, the corrected assignments
will be returned a day or two later in the recitation section.

>

> Late assignments will be penalized by one point per day late, and will no
longer be accepted once the answer sheet has been distributed. Make-up
assigments will be provided only for students with proof of a medical or
personal emergency.

>

> Your lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester, and
will not figure in the calculation of your final grade. If you skip any
homework, that grade of zero will be dropped.

>

> If you ever miss a class and need to pick up the homework assignment or
other handouts, go to the Linguistics Department office, 619 Williams Hall,
and look in the box marked "Ling 001" on the front counter. In most cases,
however, the materials will be available on the web, from the links on the
[course schedule](schedule.html).

**Midterm**

> A midterm exam on Wednesday, February 25 will test knowledge of basic facts
and concepts covered in the first half of the course (weeks 1-7). It will take
the form of multiple-choice and short-answer questions requiring you to
explain or illustrate a particular concept in linguistics. See the [study
guide](study.html) for topics to be covered.

**Final**

> A comprehensive final exam will cover material from the entire course, with
more emphasis on the second half (since it was not included on the midterm).
It is [ scheduled](http://www.upenn.edu/registrar/roster/tfinals.html) for
Tuesday, April 30, from 8:30 to 10:30. Like the midterm, it will consist of
multiple-choice and short-answer questions.

In addition, a small portion of the grade is determined by **participation**
in the class, especially as indicated by regular attendance in recitation
sections with an active role in discussions.  
  
**Grading**  
---  
  
The final grade for the course will be determined according to the following
percentages.

> | Homework assignments | 50%  
> ---|---  
> Midterm exam | 15%  
> Final exam | 30%  
> Participation | 5%  
  
Interim grades are circulated by e-mail at various points in the semester. You
can also view information about [grade distributions](grades.html) for the
class overall.

The aim of this course is to explore the history of the United States from
1607 to 1877 focusing on the development of American society and politics.

At the conclusion of this course, each student should be able to produce, in
written form and orally, an internally consistent and historically accurate
narrative about how and why the United States developed as it did. To meet
this goal, students must acquire topical, chronological and geographic
knowledge of the development of the United States. Students must also learn to
evaluate their own narratives and the narratives of others for historical
accuracy. To do this students must be able to identify types of evidence used
to support claims of historical accuracy and to understand what evidence of
various kinds can and cannot be used to demonstrate. Finally, students must
learn to identify types of historical narratives and their accompanying
strengths and weaknesses.

This course meets the requirements for Liberal Arts Category 7: Historical and
Philosophical Foundations.

The basic text for the course is Nation of Nations; A Narrative History of the
American Republic, Volume I: to 1877 by James Davidson, Willaim Gienapp,
Christine Heyrman, Mark Lytle and Michael Stoff. Students are also required to
read How Did American Slavery Begin? edited by Edward Countryman and A Short
History of Reconstruction by Eric Foner.

Each evening will be divided into several parts, which will vary depending on
the material being covered. Most evenings will include a review of key points
from the reading, a chance to ask questions about other parts of the reading,
a group exercise or video excerpt, and a short lecture. For the exams, you are
responsible both for the readings and the materials we discuss in class. In
addition, you will have six homework assignments, which are listed on the
schedule and will be available on the website. You will also have several in-
class assignments. I reserve the right to add additional quizzes to the course
requirements at any time. In addition, note that most unit tests will include
a map component, so plan to make good use of the mapping exercises on the Web
Pages provided by the textbook

###  
  
Study and Research Tips

o Read all assigned material.  
o This class does not assign less reading material because it only meets once
per week. Therefore, be sure to break up the reading assignments into
manageable chunks.  
o Always read the assigned reading material before class.  
o Always bring the assigned reading material to class.  
o Create a study group with other students in the class.  
o Ask questions in class or use my office hours to pursue more thoroughly
topics that interest you and any questions you may have.  
o On test nights, the tests will be scheduled for one hour. We will reconvene
on those nights at 7:15, though I am more likely to give you an in-class
assignment than to lecture for the remaining time.  
o The [web
pages](http://www.mhhe.com/socscience/history/usa/david4/index.mhtml) provided
by the publisher of the textbook are an excellent study aid.  
o In particular, the various quizzes and exercises provided by the WebPages
are excellent preparation for the unit tests.  
o Copies of this syllabus and course assignments are available at

### Course Policies:

1\. [Office Hours](../../Office%20Documents/Officehours.htm). Please use the
office hours to discuss both specific questions raised by the course work and
more general concerns pertaining to the study of history and academic life.
Also, please use the office hours if you feel you don't understand basic or
advanced concepts discussed in class. I also like to hear your critique of my
teaching methods. If my posted hours are difficult for you, I am willing to
meet at a time of mutual convenience. I will post a sign-up sheet for office
hours and students with specific appointments have priority. In addition, if
no one is signed up, I may leave the office for short periods; if you cannot
wait a few minutes or if you want to get me at the end of an office hour, let
me know in advance.

2\. Attendance is required. A significant portion of the classwork will be
done in class. Unless you have an excused absence, you will not be allowed to
make up any graded work. If you are ill or otherwise believe your absences
should be excused, you must contact me in advance. After the class period
missed, documentation is required for an excused absence. And no class will be
excused after the fact unless you have an illness that you can document
prevented you from notifying me (For example, you were in the ambulance on
your way to the hospital on the morning of class).

3\. Deadlines. Assignments will be collected at the beginning of the class
period on the day they are due. Late assignments will not be accepted.

4\. Academic honesty. All work done for this course must be your own. When
using someone else's ideas or words, you must give that person credit to avoid
plagiarism. We will discuss appropriate documentation in class. Plagiarism and
other forms of scholastic dishonesty, as defined in the [Student Conduct Code
in the 2001-2003 Duluth Catalog, p.
50-53,](http://www.d.umn.edu/catalogs/archives/01jul23/umd/gen/conduct.html)
will result in zero credit for the assignment and may result in a course grade
of F or a more substantial penalty, depending on the severity of the offense.

5\. Students unable to take the final exam on the designated date are expected
to notify the instructor immediately via voicemail. Excused absences from the
final exam must be approved by the Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs. Exam
conflicts will be resolved according to the policies outlined in [the
2001/2003 Duluth Catalog, p.
47](http://www.d.umn.edu/catalogs/archives/01jul23/umd/gen/final.html).

6\. Special needs. If you have a disability, either permanent or temporary,
which might affect your performance in this class, please inform me at the
start of the semester. Methods, materials, or testing will be adapted as
required for equitable participation.

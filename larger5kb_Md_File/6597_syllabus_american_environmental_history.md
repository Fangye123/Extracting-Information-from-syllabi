**Syllabus**  

This course offers an introduction to the basic issues and sources for
understanding the history of the interaction of humans with the natural
environment of North America since European settlement. We will examine how
Americans acted to shape their environment over the past four centuries, as
well as how they perceived the environment. The fundamental premise of the
course is that how Americans have acted to shape their environment has been a
consequence of their perceptions.

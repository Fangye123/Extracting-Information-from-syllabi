session each Wednesday 3:00-3:50 in the Media Center, studio TBA.  We'll use
these sessions to see some relevant videos and have additional discussion of
course topics.  Attendance is, of course, entirely optional.   For those
unable to attend on Wednesdays at 3:00, I'll try to have the videos placed on

    History 351 is the second term of a two-term sequence on the history of American radical movement and ideas. This term we will deal with topics in American radicalism since about 1900. History 350 (not offered this year) is **not** a prerequisite.

    I do not assume that students in this class have any previous course work in American history. If at some point you find yourself unfamiliar with terminology, events, people, etc. mentioned in class or in the reading, don't hesitate to check with me. I should be able to explain it to you or refer you to some brief background reading.

    Discussion of the topics we cover this term is an important part of the course. The political, social and ethical implications of the material will, I hope, be of personal as well as intellectual interest to you. Because the class is likely to be large, I shall be lecturing a good deal of the time, but I encourage you to ask questions and make comments. Discussion will be most fruitful for all if people keep up with the reading assignments as much as possible.

Sept. 25-27: Introduction--Some General Themes    [Sept. 25
Outline](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/351sept25.htm)     [Sept. 27
Outline](http://darkwing.uoregon.edu/~dapope/351sept27.htm)  
    Read Item One (Sombart--"American Capitalism's Economic Rewards") on [electronic reserve](http://libweb.uoregon.edu/~acs/eresindex.html). Start reading Goldman, _Anarchism..._ , pp.v-xiv, 47-108, 177-240 (pp.1-40 are optional but suggested).  
        We will talk about defining "radicalism" and about differences between twentieth-century radical movements and earlier ones. We will also pose some of the questions that we will try to respond to during the term: Has American affluence been a barrier to radical success? What is the relationship between reform and radical change? What kinds of organizational forms work best for movements for social change? What is the relationship between political and cultural change? What roles have racism and sexism played in the modern history of American radicalism?

    Finish reading Goldman assignment; read Item 2 (two selections by Debs--1910 and 1911) and Item 3 (Testimony of IWW leader Vincent St. John--1916) on [electronic reserve](http://libweb.uoregon.edu/~acs/eresindex.html).  
        A complex of radical movements flourished in the years before World War I. Although we will focus on the life and ideas of Emma Goldman, America's leading advocate of anarchism, we will also consider the most dramatic example of radicalism within the labor movement, the Industrial Workers of the World, and the Socialist Party of America, which reached its height of political influence in these years. In particular, Goldman=s life provides an opportunity to discuss the relationship between personal life and social change.

    Read Steinbeck, _In Dubious Battle_ ; read Item 4 (two selections by Browder, 1935 and 1967) on [electronic reserve](http://libweb.uoregon.edu/~acs/eresindex.html).  
        If, as many have claimed, prosperity has doomed radicalism in the United States, why wasn't there a revolution in the Great Depression of the 1930s, when the economy was in shambles for a decade? What _did_ radical movements accomplish in the 1930s? Is it possible that their strategies ultimately strengthened the system they were trying to overthrow? Reading John Steinbeck =s vivid novel _In Dubious Battle_ will allow us to discuss both the effectiveness and the morality of left-wing strategies and tactics.

        The eruption of protest in the 1960s was one of the more remarkable surprises in American history. In the movement for African American freedom, in opposition to the war in Vietnam and in a host of other struggles, a "New Left" made its mark. Focusing in on Berkeley, California gives us not a typical case of 1960s radicalism but one which reveals both the creative and the destructive aspects of the movements of the decade. In particular, we can discuss the relationship between political radicalism and the "counter-culture," the radical critique of "corporate liberalism", and the uneasy interactions of a predominantly middle-class white student movement with African American struggles.

    Read Epstein, _Political Protest and Cultural Revolution,_ chapters 1-3, 5 and 7 required; ch. 4 and 6 optional; read Item 6 (Gamson, "Silence, Death and the Invisible Enemy,") on[ electronic reserve ](http://libweb.uoregon.edu/~acs/eresindex.html)  
        Despite claims that radicalism is dead, social movements of the 1980s and 1990s pose important challenges to the status quo. Epstein's book is a study of non-violent direct action movements by someone who played an active role in them. Gamson is another scholar-activist who looks at some of the internal tensions and paradoxes in the militant AIDS protest group, ACT-UP.  We'll look at theories about the kinds of "New Social Movements" and "Identity Politics" that seem to thrive when class conflict is hard to detect and the Marxist left is very weak.

# Class Schedule

* * *

Jump to Week 2

On this page you will find updates to the class schedule as well as links to
lecture outlines, lists of terms from the textbook, assignment instructions,
study guides, and lists of other relevant web pages and Internet resources.
For your convenience, you will also be able to access the current lecture
outline and current assignment instructions directly from the [main
page](index.html) of this site. Many of these items will be placed here
without graphics or special formating so that you can more easily print them
out if you wish and use them for study guides.

**Important note on the lecture outlines:** Normally I plan to post the
lecture outlines previous to class so that you can print them out and bring
them to class if you wish. Everything I have on the overheads (sans the maps
and graphics) will be in these outlines. The lecture outlines included here in
no way represent a substitute for attending class. They are designed merely to
indicate the major themes and give the spellings of difficult words of items
we discuss in class. For the exams and other written assignments, you will
need to know the broader historical significance of the items listed in the
outlines. Much of this information will be presented only in the lecture.

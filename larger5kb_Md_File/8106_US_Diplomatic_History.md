`And yet to found a republic, maintain states, to govern a kingdom, organize
an army, conduct a war, dispense justice, and extend empire, you will find
neither prince, nor republic, nor captain, nor citizen, who has recourse to
the examples of antiquity! This neglect, I am persuaded, is due less to
weakness to which the vices of our education have reduced the world, than to
the evils caused by the proud indolence which prevails in most of the
Christian states, and to the lack of real knowledge of history, the true sense
of which is not known, or the spirit of which they do not comprehend. Thus the
majority of those who read it take pleasure only in the variety of the events
which history relates, without ever thinking of imitating the noble actions,
deeming that not only difficult, but impossible; as though heaven, the sun,
the elements and men had changed the order of their motions and power, and
were different from whatever were in ancient times.`

This course will explore the theory and conduct of America's foreign relations
from 1898 to 1989 with emphasis on the events and ideas that have shaped
American foreign policy in the twentieth-century. The goal of this class is
for each student to achieve the following: an understanding of the primary
themes and theoretical approaches (schools of thought) that have been advanced
to explain America's foreign relations; a knowledge of the major events, both
domestic and international, that comprise the historical record of America's
foreign relations; and an ability to distinguish various periods within the
historic record and describe the reasons advanced to demarcate the periods.
The following will be expected of students in this class: to demonstrate a
capacity to conduct historical research based upon secondary sources; to
undertake critical analysis of the material presented in class and in the
assigned readings; and to integrate the material presented in class and in the
assigned readings into a coherent history of America's diplomatic history
during the twentieth century.

Final/Term Paper

**

The final and term paper are one and the same. The assignment for the term
paper is as follows:

Write a research paper on the history of American foreign policy during the
period of the Cold War (1945-1989). Include in your paper a discussion of
America's foreign policy objectives; the challenges confronting the U.S. in
achieving those objectives; and the strategies and policies that were
developed to meet these challenges and achieve the desired objectives. Among
the questions that one might address include the following: How did American
foreign policy evolve over time and what forces brought on this evolution?
What interests motivated U.S. foreign policy? What policies were successful or
unsuccessful and why? What role did the international system, the various
states, and individuals play in the development and evolution of American
policy? What effects did the pursuit of these policies have on the U.S. and
other regions of the world including the Third World? Did American policy
during this period represent a "new era" of American foreign policy or was it
the culmination of long-standing themes? Integrate into your essay material
from both the lectures and the readings. Include in your essay as much
historical detail as needed to support your ideas. Appropriate references are
required. Your paper should include a bibliography.

**About the Course:   This course explores the impact of new information
technologies on historical practice, focusing especially on research, teaching
and the presentation of  historical materials, as well as on changes in
professional organization and discourse.  The primary goal of the course is to
better prepare advanced undergraduates and graduate students for their roles
as both students and teachers of history.**

**Most class meetings will be divided into two parts.   The first part of each
class will be devoted to a discussion of weekly readings and assignments. The
second part will give you a chance to enhance your technical skills. The
course will include a collaborative team project that will take the form of a
web site.  For details, see [The Projects](Projects.html).**

**Graduate students taking the course will be expected to undertake two
additional projects, a lecture and/or scholarly presentation and an essay
review on the impact of new information technologies on a particular area of
historical studies.   For details, see [For Graduate
Students](Hist687.html).**

Reagan, _History & the Internet_, (McGraw-Hill, 2002). Reagan's book appeared
too late to be considered for adoption for this course.  However, I have asked

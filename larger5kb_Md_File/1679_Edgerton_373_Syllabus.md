**Course Objectives:** Welcome to History 373, American Environmental History.
This course explores a relatively new historical and interdisciplinary field.
As such, the approach we take will be interdisciplinary, hopefully innovative,
and should be challenging to both students and instructor.  The primary
objective of the course is to introduce students to the field through a series
of readings, lectures, guest speakers, films, and discussions.  The underlying
assumption or philosophy I adopt is that any serious student of America cannot
make sense of its history without understanding various human cultures'
relationship to their respective environments.  We will proceed somewhat
chronologically for the first 2/3 of the course and topically toward the
latter 1/3.  We will also focus on our local and regional environmental
history toward the latter part of the semester.

**Required Texts:**  
Cronon, Changes in the Land  
Merchant, Major Problems in American Environmental History  
Jenkins, The Lawn:  A History of an American Obsession

All are in the MSU-Billings bookstore.  Please purchase them.

Also, I have placed several articles on two-hour reserve in the library that
are noted in the reading schedule below.  Please read those articles by the
week of their assignment.

**Graded Requirements**  
All students will be required to:  
\--Complete an in-class, mid-term essay examination over assigned
readings/discussions. Worth 20%  
\--Complete a final take-home, comprehensive essay examination.  Worth 20%  
\--Complete ten one-page response papers on material from the weekly reading.
Worth 20%.  
Note:  Response papers are due on Thursdays unless instructor makes other
arrangements announced in advance.  Thus, please have all reading done by
Thursdays.  
\--Complete a 10-12 page topical research paper on an issue of your choosing
in American  
environmental history, Montana environmental history, or regional/local
environmental  
history.  Worth 20%  
\--Regular attendance, participate in class, and deliver a brief (5-7 minutes)
presentation of your research near the end of the semester.  Worth 20%

Please be advised that more than two unexcused absences will lower your final
course grade.

**Research paper instructions**  
You are to research and write a typed, double-spaced 10-12 page typed double-
spaced paper about the an issue, problem or debate in American, regional,
Montana, or local environmental history of your own choosing.  Some
suggestions:  
\--the 1872 Mining Law or mining generally  
\--toxic waste cleanup and EPA Superfund sites  
\--Earth First!  
\--public lands  
\--eco-tourism  
\--water, dam-building, irrigation issues  
\--The creation of Yellowstone as a national park in 1872  
\--urban sprawl  
\--clear-cutting  
\--conservation  
\--Earth Day, 1970  
\--James Watt (Secretary of the Interior under Reagan)  
\--Stuart Udall, (Secretary of the Interior under JFK and LBJ)  
\--a comparison of Udall and Watt (two polar extremes)  
\--Native Americans and the environment  
\--Bison slaughter in Yellowstone, Winter, 1997  
\--Bison slaughter in the West, 1870s-1880s  
\--the Nuclear West  
\--the 1964 Wilderness Act  
\--wolves in Yellowstone  
\--coal-mining on the Northern Plains  
\--Ecofeminism  
\--Rachel Carson and Silent Spring

There are dozens, hundreds, thousands of other topics.  If you want to get
some background on just about any of these, or other, topics of direct concern
in the West, go to the library and browse through High Country News (or inter-
library loan it on microfilm) a newspaper devoted exclusively to western,
environmental, and resources issues.  The essays and documents in Merchant
also could be of help.   You should also consult with me about your topic so I
may help point you toward sources or assist you in choosing a topic!!!  You
will have a topic chosen by March 12.  I will require that you draft an
introductory paragraph to your paper and provide a list of preliminary
resources (total:  1 page typed).

You are expected to use both primary and secondary sources.  A primary source
is a first-hand account.  Examples of primary sources include:  
\--newspapers  
\--government reports  
\--court records  
\--letters/diaries  
\--interviews with principal parties involved  
\--business records  
\--oral history

A secondary source is one written by an historian, journalist, or other third-
party not directly involved in the issue, but who has merely written after
observing or researching after the fact.

You may locate research material in our library; Professor Paula Duffy is an
excellent reference and government documents librarian who can help you.
Also, Parmly library has strong holdings in Montana and the immediate region;
talk to Jim Curry who has an office in the Montana Room on the 2nd floor--he
also has an encyclopedic knowledge about research sources.  You may also use
our inter-library loan to obtain microfilm of newspapers or government
documents from many different libraries in the region.  Internet sites are
increasing daily.  You may find valuable information there too.

You are also expected to document your paper appropriately.  That is, you will
use footnotes or endnotes (I don't care which).  All sources that you use
should be documented in your paper.  I would like a title page, but you don't
need to include a bibliography.  You should construct footnotes/endnotes
according to the style mandated by The Chicago Manual of Style and outlined in
Kate Turabian, A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations
--both of which are on permanent reserve at the front desk of the library.
You may purchase a copy of this book (Turabian) in the bookstore or in any
local bookstore.  We will talk more about appropriate footnote/endnote style
and research in a few weeks.  I have also placed several style guides on two-
hour reserve; please consult them for proper footnote/endnote citation style.
Your paper will not be acceptable if you do not  
document it correctly.  You will be graded also on grammar, style of
presentation, and the quality of your research.  Do your best work.  Proofread
several times.  Have a friend proofread.

One final word.  Academic honesty is expected of all students.  The categories
of prohibited activities specifically of concern are cheating and plagiarism.
Neither will be tolerated on examinations, papers, or other academic
activities.  Cheating is broadly defined as any activity, method or technique
which gives a student unfair advantage over other students in the completion
of evaluated work or which substitutes work done by another for one's own.
Plagiarism involves submitting as one's own the words and/or ideas of others
without proper and customary acknowledgement of one's sources.  The penalty
for violations of academic honesty is FAILURE IN THE COURSE and remanding to
the Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs for possible expulsion from the
university.  Don't cheat or plagiarize, it isn't worth it.

If you are in doubt about anything you have researched or written please do
not hesitate to see me!

 COURSE DESCRIPTION

Using the above texts, this course will survey the various changes in dogma,
theory, technology, and methodological approaches to behavioral science.
Inasmuch as many of you will continue on to graduate school, _History of
Psychology is_ the best time to prepare for the Graduate Record Exams which
emphasize historical issues (some, like ours, actually require the Psychology
exam). For those not continuing in psychology, the class should still be
interesting because it summarizes the changes psychology and psychologists
have experienced, thereby providing more breadth in your understanding of the
study of human and animal behavior.

  

COURSE REQUIREMENTS

We will **** cover every chapter in the Leahey book, although some will be
emphasized more than others.  
Most generally, we will spend about one week (two class sessions) on each
chapter. Class will be conducted in a mixed lecture-discussion format.

Basically, I will touch on the important principles about each topic, and we
can discuss examples or specific issues as they arrive. It would _behoove you
to have read or reviewed that_ _day's_ _the book before class._ In terms of
assessing your progress, there will be five requirements in the course upon
which your final grade will be determined. First, class participation will
count for 10% of your grade. This is done by getting to know who you are over
the course of the semester and my making notations about your participation in
class discussions; this includes the experience I have with your asking
questions. If you are intimidated by large numbers of people, you can meet
with me during my regular office hours noted above. Participation is also made
up of your attendance as recorded on random dates. The way I deal with
attendance is to assign a short one-page thought paper that you complete in
class during the last 5-10 minutes on that particular day. The topic is based
upon whatever we covered that day. The thought papers themselves are also
weighted 10%; while they do not receive grades per se, you do receive credit
for turning them in (the only provision is that you were serious in what you
wrote about). will spend Class will Basically, topic, and arise. it _section_
in



Four short multiplechoice, multiple-matching, and essay exams will count for
40% of your grade. A course project will be assigned to groups of 2 people.
The project will be discussed at length in class during the second week of the
course. For now, it basically involves you and a partner reading one or more
of the 40 studies described in Hock's book, and then giving a presentation to
the class and leading its discussion of the issues. (I must approve of the
study you have selected; first come, first served.) The presentations are
about 7-10 minutes long and are announced to the class a week before so they
have time to review that study in their book, and come up with discussion
questions. The presentations will be given during that last 20-30 minutes of
class. Your presentation must be scheduled and completed by the end of
prefinals week; its value is 10%. Lastly, a 10-page research paper will be
required on or before the day of the final; it will be weighted 30%. Like many
instructors of Psych/History, I view the course as a capstone, normally taken
during your senior year. Therefore, you have a wealth of experience in
Psychology and a 10 page paper is not an excessive requirement. We will
discuss the paper more in class and I will guide each of you through the
process of finding an appropriate topic; the paper is due on December 9th; I
must approve of your topic by November 6th; please try to wait until late
October before worrying about a topic, however. An abstract of this paper will
be due on November 13th; no exceptions. After November 13th, you may turn in a
rough draft to me at any time, and as many times after that, as you like, for
me to review and suggest edits. This helps you produce, an A paper. HOWEVER,
_I_ _REQUIRE THAT THE DRAFT BE SPELLCHECKED, GRAMMAR-CHECKED, AND_ _FORMATTED
PROPERLY ACCORDING TO THE APA 4TH EDITION, OR I WILL_ _HAVE TO HAND IT BACK TO
YOU._ Also, turning in the paper early and getting feedback _does not_ mean
you "automatically" get an A; it simply improves your chances. Best thing to
do is to have a classmate review it for you first. More on all this later.
Remember, however, that if you have a perfect A going into finals week,
failure to turn in a paper can lower your grade to a C. At the end of the
semester, I add up all the grades for each category, multiply them by their
percentage weighting, and record your final grade. Please check with me during
office hours if you wish to know how you're progressing.

Grades are computed by the following rating: 90 - 100 = A; 80-89 = B; 70-79 =
C; 60-69 = D; 59 and below = _F._

  

ATTENDANCE AND LATE WORK POLICY

Despite the participation and thought papers component of your grade, failure
to attend class regularly will be dealt with in the following manner. Miss
three class sessions during the semester, and you lose half of your
participation and thought papers grades; miss 5 sessions when we have thought
papers due during the semester and you lose it all, i.e., 20% of your grade.
The highest you can pull will be a C if all your exams and your paper were A
work. Excused absences will be accepted, but you will still be held
responsible for the work at an agreed upon date sometime later. Also, makeup
exams are given only on the day of the final after you turn in the final
exam... simply ask for the lst, 2nd, or 3rd exam at that time.

ADDITIONAL ITEMS:

1.All OSU policies, procedures, and student conduct codes apply. You are
expected to abide by them.  
2.I have a zero-tolerance policy for academic dishonesty and misconduct.  
3.Regular late attendance is disruptive and I will take it up with you if it
is excessive.  
4.Delays in turning in your abstract or final paper will count against you at
the rate of 5% per day.  
5\. You are encouraged to meet with me to see how you're doing in the couse
and what you might do to improve.  
6\. The University's drop/add policies in the schedule apply.  
7\. Most of you probably already own the APA 4th edition Manual, if not, you
might consider purchasing one or checking one out of the library, because I
stick to those criteria when I grade your paper.





EXTRA CREDIT POLICY:

Extra credit will be offered for participation in experiments solicited
through our classroom; please do not ask me to give you credit for
participation arranged through another class. However, because the need and
availability of research projects varies from semester to semester, we will
have to discuss the extra credit system as it arises. Thus, my oral
instructions regarding extra credit will apply at such time that extra credit
becomes available. I will say this, however. In the past, it has not been
uncommon for me to use extra credit points as a means to decide swing grades,
e.g., when you're stuck between two grades. Generally, I offer 3 points per
hour of participation; that's also about how much you will need to improve
your grade. More later.

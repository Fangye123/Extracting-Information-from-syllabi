**_course description and objectives_**

  
This is a course about the theory and practice of free speech as it has
evolved in the West over the past several centuries. This is also a course
that's more about questions than answers, more about wrestling with difficult
issues than offering easy solutions. Some of the general questions we'll
examine this semester include:

  * Is free speech a right or a privilege? 
  * Who is allowed to speak and what are they allowed to say? 
  * What responsibilities (if any) go along with the right to free speech? 
  * Is freedom of expression a necessary feature of a democracy? 
  * What limits (if any) do we need to place on free speech? 
  * What types of restriction on expression count as censorship? 
  * Can we distinguish speech from action? Should we? And, if so, how? 
  * And who's empowered to make these decisions anyway? 
Barring a small miracle or three, we will not solve any of the social,
cultural, or political problems that lie at the heart of this class. This
course is not designed, however, to provide you with the "right" answers or
easy "solutions," as much as it's intended to make you think critically about
the issues involved. Regardless of what you may believe at the start of the
semester, this course will challenge (and perhaps even change) your current
way of looking at democracy and free speech as they exist in the US today.

* * *

**_WARNING!!!_**

  
The subjects that we'll be discussing this semester are, without exception,
controversial ones. As a result, many of our class sessions will generate
heated arguments, and it's possible that you'll walk away from one or more of
our meetings feeling angry, frustrated, and/or offended. Nevertheless, I
expect _all_ of our conversations to be characterized by mutual respect.
Impassioned arguments and strongly expressed opinions are perfectly acceptable
in this class; verbal bullying and personal attacks, on the other hand, will
**_not_** be tolerated under any circumstances.

* * *

**_required course materials_**

  * **Books.**
    * John Milton, _Areopagitica and Of Education_ (Harlan Davidson) 
    * John Stuart Mill, _On Liberty and Utilitarianism_ (Bantam Classic) 
    * _The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States_ (Bantam Classic)  Available at Inkwood Books, 216 S. Armenia, Tampa (253-2638, [inkwoodbks@aol.com](mailto:inkwoodbks@aol.com)).  
  
[N.B.: The main texts of the documents contained in the books above are in the
public domain -- and can thus be found in a number of different published
editions. You should know, however, that (a) the assigned editions are among
the least expensive ones available anywhere, and (b) the prefaces and
forewords to these specific editions (which _aren't_ likely to be available
elsewhere) are part of the required reading for the course. I.e., you use
other editions of these texts are your own risk.]  
  

  * **Non-book readings.** These will all be available online or -- in rare cases -- as handouts distributed in class.  
  

  * **Reliable, regular access to the World Wide Web.** Most of the required reading for this class will **only** be available to you online, and all of your written work will be submitted online. As a result, you will **not** be able to complete the course successfully without being able to access the Web on a consistent basis. If you don't already have access to the Internet from your home or workplace, you will need to make use of the free e-mail account and open-use computer labs provided by Academic Computing (LIB 608). 

* * *

**_grading schedule_**

  
Half of your final grade will be determined by the following:  
  
Attendance | 10%  
---|---  
Participation | 15%  
Quizzes | 15%  
Thought paper | 10%  
  
The remaining half of your grade will be based on one of the following three
clusters of assignments:  
  
Plan #1 | Plan #2 | Plan #3  
---|---|---  
1 Case Study -- 10% | 1 Case Study -- 10% | 4 Case Studies -- 40% (10% each)  
1 Response Paper -- 10% | 4 Response Papers -- 40% (10% each) | 1 Response
Paper -- 10%  
Take-Home Final Exam -- 30% |   |  
  
Which of these plans you choose is entirely up to you, and all three are
available to you as long as you complete and submit enough assignments on time
to fulfill the requirements (e.g., if your first completed response paper is
#3, you've ruled yourself out of plan #2 since you will no longer be able to
turn in 4 response papers on time). "Mix-and-match" combinations other than
those listed above are not permitted.  
  
Final semester grades will _not_ use the plus/minus grading system.

* * *

**_attendance_**

  
Because issues will be raised in class that will not necessarily be obvious
from the readings alone, it's important that you **_show up every time we
meet_** and that you do so **_on time_**. Attendance will be taken at the
start of every class period, and absences, late arrivals, _and_ early
departures will all count against you. If you accumulate more than 1.5 weeks
in unexcused absences, I reserve the right to lower your semester grade by
more than the normal 10% assigned to attendance.  
  

* * *

**_particpation_**

  
Our class sessions will be structured almost exclusively around group
discussions. It will thus be more enjoyable for all of us (and you'll do
better) if you (1) attend class regularly, (2) do the required reading and (3)
be prepared to discuss what we've read.  
  
This is **_not_** a course designed for the passive spectator, and you will be
expected to contribute meaningfully to our discussions -- in-class and online
-- on a **_weekly_** basis. There are three major pieces of the participation
portion of your grade:

  * In-class group exercises 
  * In-class discussions 
  * Online discussions (Blackboard Discussion Board) 
Participation grades will be assessed and calculated on a weekly basis, and
the minimum level of participation necessary to earn a **_D_** for any given
week will be to participate actively and meaningfully in our in-class group
exercises. Additional participation -- either during our in-class discussions
or on the Blackboard Discussion Board -- will boost your weekly participation
score proportionately.  
  
A few additional notes/tips re: participation:

  * Should you miss class, your participation grade for that week will consist _entirely_ of your contribution to our online discussions. As such, you should plan to add to that aspect of our conversations more extensively during the week immediately following any class you miss. 
  * Because participation grades will be calculated on a weekly basis, it will _not_ help your score to "pile on" participation points one week in order to make up for low-participation weeks at other times during the semester. 
  * While I will make an effort to insure that as many different people as possible get to be heard during our in-class discussions, unfortunately, our numbers are too large this semester to guarantee that everyone will be able to earn the maximum possible participation grade each week solely through their contributions to our in-class discussions. 

* * *

**_quizzes_**

  
To help insure that our in-class discussions are productive ones, there will
be **_weekly_** quizzes on the assigned reading that will work as follows:

  * Each quiz will consist of fact-based, short-answer questions on the assigned reading for the day the quiz is given. If you've done the reading closely enough to discuss it in class, you should have no problems passing the corresponding quiz. 
  * Quizzes will take place during the first 15 minutes of the class period. Late arrivals will **_not_** be given extra time to complete their quizzes and **_no_** make-up quizzes will be given. Missing class (or showing up more than 15 minutes late) on a quiz day earns you a failing grade for that quiz. 
  * Quizzes will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Each quiz will count towards 1% of your final grade. 

* * *

**_Blackboard_**

  
Blackboard is a Web-based educational software package that we will use in
several ways this semester:

  * as an informal space for discussion of the issues raised by the assigned readings and in our class meetings 
  * as a means to communicate course-related information and announcements in between our weekly class meetings 
  * as an online archive for official course documents (e.g., the syllabus, the assignment handouts, etc.) that's accessible 24/7 
  * as the place where you will turn in all your written work for the class 
Blackboard is accessible through the new USF "portal" site --
<https://my.usf.edu> \-- which includes information on how to sign up for the
USF NetID you'll need to enter the site. Once you have your ID and have
entered the portal site successfully, you should click on the "Courses" tab at
the top of the screen, which should lead you to a list of Blackboard sites for
the courses you're enrolled in. Further details about using Blackboard for
this course will be available on a separate handout.

* * *

**_written assignments_**

  
**_General rules_**

  1. Your written work _must_ be submitted online in the appropriate forums on the Blackboard Discussion Board. The lengths listed below are _estimates_ of how much you'll need to write to complete the assignments well. I will not automatically penalize shorter papers, but it's unlikely that you will be able to do "A" work if your papers are shorter than the suggested length. 
  2. All your work must be posted to the appropriate forums on the course website **_by 6 pm_** on the listed due dates. Late work will generally not be accepted except in cases of genuine emergency. In the event that I do accept late work, I reserve the right to reduce its grade in direct proportion to its lateness. The minimum penalty in all such cases will be one full letter grade. 
  3. As a safety precaution, you should _always_ keep at least a hard copy -- and preferably a hard copy _and_ a disk copy -- of any written work you hand in. 
**_Thought paper (10%)_**  
This assignment (750-1000 words, due 22 January) will be _ungraded_. Assuming
you turn the paper in, you should receive full credit for doing so. I reserve
the right, however, to give partial (or even no) credit to papers that fail to
meet the assignment's requirements.  
  
**_Response papers (10% each)_**  
You will write at least one -- and as many as four -- paper (750-1000 words
each) over the course of the semester, each of which should be a critical
(i.e., thoughtful and analytical) response to one or more of the assigned
readings. Due dates are listed on the course timetable.  
  
**_Case studies (10% each)_**  
Over the course of the semester, I will post five case studies involving
freedom of expression issues to the course website. For each case study, your
task will be to write up a report that outlines the most important arguments
from each side of the case (two lists of at least 10 items each), and that
makes an argument (750-1000 words) for the best solution to the case. Due
dates are listed on the course timetable.  
  
**_Take-home final exam (30%)_**  
The take-home final (due 7 May) will consist entirely of essay questions and
will be based on the assigned readings and our in-class discussions. It will
consist of one mandatory essay question and two questions that you will choose
from a larger selection. Each of the three essays should be 750-1000 words
long and will be weighted equally in your exam grade.  
  
**_"Drop the low score" option_**  
Assuming you still do so on time, turning in more case studies or response
papers than your chosen plan requires will allow you to drop the lowest score
within the relevant category (i.e., an "extra" case study can't replace a
response paper grade -- or vice versa).  
  
N.B.: Further details about each of the assignments listed above will be made
available on separate handouts.

* * *

**_miscellaneous_**

  * The purchase and/or sale of either written notes or audio recordings of our class meetings is strictly prohibited. 
  * Cell phones, beepers, pagers, etc. are to be **_turned off_** or set to vibrate **_silently_** before you come to class. If your phone rings or if your beeper/pager goes off loudly enough to be heard during class, you _will_ be required to leave immediately and you will _not_ receive credit for attending or participating in class that day. 
  * In keeping with the University Policy on Religious Observances, students who anticipate being absent from class due to a major religious observance must provide notice to me **_in writing by 15 January_** explaining which class period(s) you expect to miss and why.

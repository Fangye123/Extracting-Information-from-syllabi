**COURSE DESCRIPTION:**

**This course examines the historical and philosophic foundations of education
in our socially and culturally diverse country. The thoughts of influential
educators are introduced. The principles and ideas underlying educational
policies are examined. The student is challenged to build a philosophy of
education by identifying the ideologies behind educational systems, curricula
and goals. Current curricular approaches to character education will be
examined. Students will learn to integrate character education into all they
do as a future teacher.**

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

  1. **synthesize the main contributions to education made by significant groups in the past**
  2. **identify individuals in history who have made major contributions which affect current educational practices**
  3. **demonstrate an awareness of the importance of the individual person in the field of education**
  4. **identify the components involved in developing an educational philosophy and relate them to philosophy in general, one's personal philosophy and one's classroom teaching**
  5. **explain the importance of teaching character education throughout the curriculum, giving examples of practical instructional strategies, methods and techniques and curricular materials that can be used**

**COURSE REQUIREMENTS:**

  1. **Each student is expected to come to each class meeting ready to discuss the readings assigned for that session. Attendance and class participation contribute to the final grade.**

  1. **Students will successfully write discussion question for each articles read which will will help the class to reflect on the reading.**

  1. **There will be periodic assessments on the readings and class assignments. Students will be allowed to choose among alternative modes of assessment in order to show their mastery of the concepts of that section. These can be projects, games, simulations, presentations, short papers, computer assignments or short quizzes.**

  1. **Students will work in a cooperative group to 1) research one historical figure in Education and present a short presentation on that person and 2) lead the class discussion of the reading from this educator's writings. Presentations should be 10 minutes in length and should be presented on the day indicated on the syllabus and then followed by a 20 minute class discussion. Presentations should contain the following information: biographical and historical data and the importance of this person's contribution to education. You are encouraged to be inventive and creative with your presentation: Consider assuming the personality of the educator, interviewing the person, have a panel discussion, present a small play or role-play, conduct a sample lesson or video tape the presentation. The group will work on discussion questions which will stimulate interpretive and evaluative thinking and discussion regarding the reading. A group grade will be given based on evidence that all members have contributed and worked together well as a group and that the presentation had content, creativity, organization was delivered well using visuals, handouts or hands on activities.**

  1. **Each student will write a short paper (4-6 pages) in which they will describe their philosophy of education. We will learn in class how to organize this paper around the framework given by the author of our text. An excellent paper will describe the method used to organize the paper in the thesis paragraph and then follow that method in developing the paper. Students will want to include how they will teach character education in their particular class assignment. The paper should be personalized but also well cited using the words of the educators we have read this semester. It should include a bibliography. This can then be included in their portfolio.**

**SEE GRADINGRUBRICS FOR MORE INFORMATION**

**ATTENDANCE POLICY:**

**Students are expected to attend all classes and to participate in class
discussions, group activities, projects and field trips. Any student who must
miss a class session should contact the Instructor before the class meeting.
Students are responsible for all material covered in that session. Students
should get a class "buddy" who will collect any handouts given in that class
for them. Attendance is considered in the calculation of the student's final
grade.**

**It is the student's responsibility to submit class assignments on time,
whether or not they attend the class. ALL assignments must be submitted when
due. They will then be returned at the next class meeting. Any late
assignments will automatically be lowered one grade for being late and will be
returned to the student at the end of the course. Assignments may be faxed to
the instructor if a student cannot attend class (815) 740-4285. **

**PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC INTEGRITY:**

**Students should refer to the "Guidelines on Academic Integrity" in the USF
catalog regarding their obligations for honesty in carrying out academic
assignments. In addition, anyone entering the teaching profession must be an
educator with moral values and outstanding character. Students are expected to
be honest in all their classwork.**

**In order to correctly acknowledge the use of other's ideas in your class
assignments, correct citation must be given. Students may use whatever format
with which they are familiar; however education is considered a social science
and educational journals usually use the APA format or the University of
Chicago Manual of Style. Students may acknowledge the source in the text, use
footnote or endnotes, but citation must appear. A bibliography is expected in
all research papers. It is not appropriate to cite from Educational Digest as
this is a journal which summaries journal articles. It is better to read the
original article.**

**COURSE INSTRUCTIONAL METHODOLOGIES: **

**As this course seeks to prepare future teachers, a variety of instructional
methodologies will be employed in order to expose students to different
methods of teaching while also teaching the content. These methods will
include lectures, class discussions, cooperative groups, projects, class
presentations, audiovisuals, and on site observations and interviews.**

**In order to adequately integrate the history and the philosophy of
education, the course will be divided into two distinct parts. In the first
part, influential ideas from significant historical individuals will be
examined. In the second part, the philosophic applications of these ideas will
be examined.**

**COURSE DESCRIPTION**

This course will examine contemporary Asian politics and government, with a
major focus on the nations of Japan, India, and China. The course will seek to
familiarize students with current political behavior and institutions, and
their relationship to historical and cultural forces. Particular attention
will be given to crossnational comparisons of Asian nations, to highlight the
similarities and differences in each country's political evolution. The course
will also address the impact of Western nations on Asia. The course's goal is
to promote a better understanding of this increasingly important region, which
includes the world's largest democracy (India), the largest nation under
Communist rule (China), and one of the world's most successful economies
(Japan).

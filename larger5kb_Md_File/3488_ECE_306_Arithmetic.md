                  92 - 84 = B                            
                  83 - 75 = C  
                  74 - 66 = D  
                  65 -  0  = F

A professional subjective evaluation will be made on all assignments.  
  
**Attendance** :  
  
Students are expected to attend all classes.  After three (3) absences, your
grade is subject to being lowered.  Three tardies equal one absence.

**Policies** :

It is the responsibility of the student to read and understand the syllabus.

After written and oral explanations of assignments and policies are given it
is the student's responsibility to fully understand what is required and
expected.

It is the policy of the University of North Alabama to afford equal
opportunity in education to qualified students.  If you have a disability that
may prevent you from meeting the course requirements, contact the instructor
within the first three class sessions of the semester to file a Student
Disability Statement and to develop an accommodation plan.  Course
requirements will not be waived but accommodations will be made to allow you
to meet the requirements, provided that you are timely in working with the
instructor to develop an accommodation plan.

 I have received a copy of the syllabus for ECE 306-01 for the fall 2001

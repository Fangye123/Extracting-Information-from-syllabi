**Syllabus**

**Purpose:** The purpose of L524 is to introduce students to the basic

and  acquaint them with the history, philosophy, and function of the
information services.

**Objectives:** By the end of the semester, students should be able to:

  1. identify, compare, and evaluate information sources; identify the sources most likely to contain specific types of information, 
  2. discuss the reference process, including techniques of question negotiation and search strategy, 
  3. define the responsibilities of the reference librarian; identify reference and information services in different context, and 
  4. discuss current issues in information service. 

**Readings:** There are no required textbooks for this course. There will be a
Readings Packet.

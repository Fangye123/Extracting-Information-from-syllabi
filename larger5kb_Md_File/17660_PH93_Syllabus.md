### Course Policy and Evaluation

**

  1. Academic Credit:** This course counts as a full 1.0 credit January Term course. Only 0.5 credit of PH93 may count towards a physics major or minor.  


**

  2. Class Meetings:** The class will meet five days per week (MTWRF from 9:00-11:30) for lectures, recitations, discussions, and exams. _Students are expected to have read assigned materials before coming to class_.   Occasionally, students will be asked to present lectures on the assigned material in order to demonstrate reading comprehension.  


**

  3. Labs:** There will be a three-hour lab session every Monday and Wednesday afternoon from 1:30-4:20. (Additional lab time will be available on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons as needed). Students will work in a group designing, conducting and analyzing each experiment. A comprehensive lab notebook will be kept. The evaluation of the lab will be done both by group (i.e. evaluation of the experimental design and lab notebook) and individually (based on observed participation). During the final week of lab, there will be a lab project which will allow a more detailed study of some topic.  


**

  4. Attendance:** Regular attendance at all classes and labs is expected. Students are responsible for informing themselves of all announcements and assignments made in the classroom.  


  5. **Homework:** Problems sets will be assigned for approximately every chapter. Homework sets should be neat and organized. Each student will submit their own assignment, but you are encouraged to discuss the problems with each other.  


**

  6. Late Homework** : Late homework will be accepted at the discretion of the instructor with some loss of points.   


  7. **Problem Discussion Sessions:** Ocassionally during the course, we will have problem discussion sessions. Students will be asked to solve a particular problem illustrative of the material being studied in class.   All students will be required to submit a detailed solution of the problem on the class period following the discussion session.  


  8. **Exams:** There will be two one-hour exams and a two-hour final exam. The hour exams will have a short answer section, and three or four problems similar in difficulty to those of the problem sets. The final exam will be roughly half on material covered after the last hour exam with the remainder of the exam comprehensive.  


**

  9. Missed Exams** : Students are expected to arrange _in writing_ with the instructor **well in advance** to take an exam at other than the announced time. _Permission to make up a missed exam after the fact will be at the discretion of the instructor and should not be assumed._  


**

  10. Academic Honesty** : _In all academic exercises, examinations, papers, and reports, students shall submit their own work. Footnotes, or some other acceptable form of citation must accompany any use of another's words or ideas._ (The full text of the Gustavus Academic Honesty Policy may be found in the Gustavus Adolphus College Academic Catalog).  


  11. **Evaluation:
**

    
             30%  Hour Exams
         25%  Final Exam
         20%  Lab
         25%  Homework & Problem Discussions

Final course grades will be assigned using the following scale as a guide:

    
             94-100    A         74-78   C+
         90-94     A-        70-74   C
         86-90     B+        66-70   C-
         82-86     B         62-66   D+
         78-82     B-        58-62   D
                              0-58   F

Assignment of final letter grades will also take into account the instructor's
subjective evaluation of the student's attendance, initiative, class
participation, preparation (particularly quantity and quality of homework),
and evidence of improvement.  


**

  12. Incompletes:** A grade of incomplete will only be given for work not completed due to circumstances beyond the control of the student. ( **This is the college's policy** )

  13. Schedule:** Below is an preliminary schedule of topics and labs for the term. This is subject to change.

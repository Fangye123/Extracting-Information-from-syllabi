> COURSE RATIONALE AND DESCRIPTION:History is basically a study of the people
who have come before us. A course of this natureattempts to analyze and to
interpret those people and the events that shaped their lives. An
understanding of history can give a long-range perspective to your life
without which it might be impossible to be truly human. (Think what it would
be like if you had no personal memory-if you had to go through life not
knowing anything that had happened to you before the present moment.) Also,
history partially reveals the nature of individual persons and of human
societies-their strengths and weaknesses, humanity and inhumanity, rationality
and irrationality, progress and regression, etc. It may even suggest something
about the ultimate meaning of life itself.  
>  A study of history also gives us information about how people who
experienced life before our time tried to solve problems that confronted their
societies. Some of these problems continue to plague humankind today.
Examining the problems of the past and the attempts to solve them offers
possible suggestions for solving the problems of the present.

>  MEDIA REVIEW  
>  Each student must submit one media review. The review will  
>  be due on . The length of the review should be from 1000  
>  to 1200 words. The review should be typed. This review will  
>  count 12.5% of the final grade.  
>  Media, in its broadest sense, means any or all of the methods  
>  by which information is communicated. Examples include movies,  
>  television, newspapers, books, magazines, music, personal interaction  
>  and experiences, etc. History, the accumulated record  
>  of human experience, relies upon past and present sources to  
>  accurately portray the events and people that have influenced  
>  our world. These sources are information gathered from a variety  
>  of media. This review should emphasize this relationship  
>  between our vision of history and the methods and sources from  
>  which it is written.  
>  In choosing a media review topic, the only requirement is  
>  that it must have some historical relevance. The review might  
>  describe how certain media sources (newspaper articles, a TV  
>  program, a movie, a book, etc.) treat particular social or political  
>  issues. Or the review might focus on one topic and analyze  
>  the way a variety of sources portray it (movies and TV treatment  
>  of Native Americans or the family or women). The review might  
>  discuss the subjective nature of certain media presentations  
>  (such as biased press coverage of an event, an article slanted  
>  for political purposes, or a movie that tries to sell a message).  
>  The review may relate personal experiences or those of your  
>  friends or family. You are to analyze the sources - the media  
>  images - of a particular issue or event.  
>  In writing your media review, briefly report on the thesis,  
>  the main idea, of your paper. Use as many media examples as  
>  possible to illustrate and analyze your observations and views.  
>  This is a personal essay, so inject your opinions on why and  
>  how media shapes our perspectives on life - in other words, how  
>  does media shape history? Some media sources include:  
>  Movies Advertising  
>  Television Newspapers  
>  Music Museums/Historical Sites  
>  Books Personal Interviews  
>  Art Family Histories  
>  Magazines Internet  
>  These only are only suggestions. Be creative and feel free  
>  to write on any topic. Please see me before you begin so I can  
>  suggest sources, advise on the paper's format, and clarify any  
>  questions you may have.

>  BOOK REVIEW  
>  Each student must submit one critical book review. The  
>  book review will be due on . The length of the review  
>  should be approximately 1000 to 1200 words. The review should  
>  be typed. This review will count 12.5% of the final grade.  
>  The book you select must meet two requirements. First, it  
>  must cover the time frame and general topic of this course  
>  (either u.s. History I, U.S. History II, or Texas History).  
>  Second, the book must be a scholarly history book - not a  
>  pictorial history or a historical novel. It must be non-fiction,  
>  but it can relate to any historical topic or be a biography  
>  on any historical figure.  
>  In writing a critical book review, there are two skills  
>  which you must demonstrate.  
>  (1) Summary/Report - summarize the author's intent and purpose  
>  in writing the book; give an overall review of the major  
>  topics covered; report on the historical theme that runs  
>  throughout the book with specific examples of important  
>  events and/or people; report on specific ideas in the book  
>  that illustrate the author's thesis; this part of the review  
>  should be around 700 to 800 words.  
>  (2) Evaluation/Critique - evaluate the book from your own perspective;  
>  describe the book's strengths and weaknesses;  
>  relate what you learned from the book and give examples of  
>  parts you found interesting or boring; describe the author's  
>  point of view and analyze his/her success in putting forth  
>  the book's thesis and central themes; this section of the  
>  review should be from 300 to 500 words.  
>  After you have selected a book, please see me for approval  
>  and suggestions.

This 1-credit seminar course offers reading, reflection, and social networking
experiences for students who are engaged in projects or considering careers as
public interest informationists, (i.e., organizing information flows in
support of communal and public needs). Many students will enroll concurrently
in some kind of project work, either through a Directed Field Experience
(DFE), an independent study, or a workshop course.

We will read about and discuss theories of community, civil society, and the
role of the non-profit sector, and draw connections with project work (reading
and reflection). There will also be frequent opportunities to learn about
other students' projects and to meet some of the national leaders of the
community information movement (social networking) and possibly travel to
relevant conferences and workshops. At the end of this course, students who
are interested in pursuing careers in the community information movement
should have enough information and connections to begin a job search in this
area.

This seminar also serves as a focal point for the School of Information's
Community Information Corps, a loosely organized  interest group of faculty,
doctoral and master's students, and outside "friends". Several faculty are
planning to attend frequently, and students who do not wish to sign up for
credit are welcome to come for those sessions that they find interesting.

You are encouraged to participate for multiple semesters (you can take it for
credit up four times); while we'll keep revisiting similar themes, there will
be minimal overlap in the readings and guests. The faculty coordinator will
rotate as well, leading to slightly different emphases in different semesters.

Early in each semester, there will be announcements about project
opportunities with faculty and Directed Field Experience opportunities.
Students will be encouraged to reflect on their project experiences in the
class. Academic credit for these projects, however, will _not_ be arranged
through this class. DFEs will be administered through Karen Jordan. Workshop
courses have their own course numbers. Other projects will be arranged as
independent study directly with the supervising faculty member.

## Pre-requisites

None.

## Objectives

After participating in SI 575, you should be able to:

  * connect day-to-day grassroots activities with big ideas about citizenship, opportunity, and the public good in an information society.
  * find a job or internship as a public informationist.

## **The Big Ideas**

  * Community, social capital, public goods, and collective action 
  * Democracy and citizenship 
  * Inequality, diversity, and identity 
  * The institutional landscape of public interest information work 
  * The impact of infrastructure

Throughout our examination of these ideas, we will keep returning to
implications for the roles of information professionals.

We will keep returning to these big ideas each semester, but usually with
somewhat different readings and guests to guide our exploration.

## **Readings**

Readings will be handed out in class, or available on the Web. You will need
to read materials before class so that we can have lively discussion (see
reaction paper assignments below).

## **Assignments and Due Dates**

This is a 1-credit class. Class meets for an hour and a half each week. You
should spend, on average, about two and a half hours each week outside of
class, doing the following:

  * 24 hours before each class where readings will be discussed, post a 1-page reaction through Course Tools (I recommend that you compose this separately and then cut and paste it to Course Tools; some people have had their work disappear if they compose for a long time using the web interface in course tools).
  * for any 2 of the guests during the semester, post brief comments in the Course Tools discussion area after the guest's visit.
  * If you're involved in complementary project work, once or twice during the semester you'll be asked to present a 10 minute status report to the rest of the class. 
  * At the end of the semester you'll be required to hand in a 4-5 page reflection paper tying your project work to the themes and activities discussed in class. If you're not doing a project, this paper will simply reflect on what you've learned.

## Travel and Social Networking

If you find a conference that's worth going to and that you think will help
you in assessing job prospects or developing project ideas for future
semesters, you can ask me for travel funds.

## Grading

This class must be elected pass/fail (satisfactory/unsatisfactory). This is
not a class that lends itself to conventional grading.

## Office Hours

Thursdays 10-11AM and Fridays 1:30-2:30PM. It's a good idea to call in advance
or send email, as there are a few days when I'll have to miss office hours.

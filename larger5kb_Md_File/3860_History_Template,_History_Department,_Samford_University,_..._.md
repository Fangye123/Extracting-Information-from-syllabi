> **Purpose:** The purpose of this course is to explore the history of England
from 1750 to the present. We will concentrate primarily on England, although
we will discuss Ireland, Scotland, Wales, and the empire as necessary.
Students should come away from the class with a better understanding of the
social, political, and intellectual history of England and some grasp of the
most essential historiographical issues of the field. They should also develop
speaking, critical thinking, and writing skills.

>

> **Assignments** : This course is divided into four roughly chronological
sections. A paper is due at the end of the first three sections; the final
will cover the last section. You must do three of these four assignments,
either two of the papers and the final, or all three papers, skipping the
final. The only exception is that everyone must do the first paper; after
that, you will get a break at some point in the semester.  **Try to choose
which one to skip wisely**. You may, of course, do all four; if you choose
that option, I will drop your lowest grade. Each of these papers and the final
is worth 20% of your final grade.

>

> Another 15% of your grade will be based on your leadership of class
discussion at one point in the semester. Days of student-led discussions are
marked with an asterisk (*) on the course schedule. More on the expectations
for discussion leadership will be found at the end of the syllabus. Another
15% of your grade will be based on in-class quizzes and assignments. The final
10% of your grade will be based on class participation which includes
attendance, talking in class, and general interest in the course.

>

> **Lateness, Absences, and Make-ups:** I value promptness; chronic lateness
is unnecessary and rude. Please be to class on time. I will take attendance
every day at 10:30 a.m. The only excused absences are illness (with a doctor's
note) or university business (also documented). As soon as you know the dates
you will be gone for the latter, please let me know. I will mark off that day
as "excused" and will average your class grades without it. Otherwise absences
will count against your grade, both overall and in particular. Three lates
will equal one absence. I will offer no make-ups for missed quizzes or class
participation; one cannot "make up" class discussions. I will, however, drop
the lowest in-class grade before averaging them.

>

> I also value promptness in papers. Papers are always due at the BEGINNING of
class. I will take off 10 points a day for each day it is late, including
weekends, up to 40 points. I will accept no papers more than a week late.

>

> **Academic Dishonesty** : Anyone caught cheating in this course will be
flunked for the course. All papers should be original and written specifically
for this class. Furthermore, students may not plagiarize.

>

> Plagiarism is the act of stealing the words or ideas of another person and
passing them off as your own. The definition of plagiarism is four words in a
row. If you use four or more identical words in a row from ANY text, you must
(1) put those words in quotation marks; and (2) cite the reference in
parenthesis after the quote. For example, "he had returned from his journey
aloft" (Plato, 749). Remember: BOTH the quotation marks AND the page reference
must be present to avoid penalties for plagiarism. Close paraphrasing by
changing a word or two or the tense of the verbs is also plagiarism.

>

> If you use the IDEAS of a writer, but not his/her exact words, you should
cite the author and page without the quotation marks. However, you should
NEVER use quotation marks without citation. In other words, any time you quote
something, you must also tell the reader where the words originated.

>

> If you unintentionally plagiarize, you will be docked ten points FOR EACH
INSTANCE. If you intentionally plagiarize, you will flunk the course.

>

> Students may not collaborate on formal papers, or on the final examination.
Any students involved in such collaboration will receive zeroes on their
papers or exams. If two students are knowingly involved, BOTH are guilty and
will be penalized accordingly.

>

> **Discussion Methods:** Please observe the following rules in discussions:

>

> (1) Be to class on time. The rudest thing a student can do is be
consistently late to class. It is disruptive to everyone and harmful to
discussion. If you are consistently late, I reserve the right to penalize your
overall class grade. You will also miss the quizzes, etc., which will hurt
still more of your grade.

>

> (2) Do not speak, walk about the classroom, read, or be disruptive when
someone else is speaking.

>

> (3) Turn off all pagers and cell phones before you enter the classroom; if
you have some emergency reason for leaving them on, please set them on vibrate
mode.

>

> (4) Try to stay on topic. Your remarks should actually follow up on those of
any speaker (either to disagree, agree, expand the point, etc.). I will ask,
then, that no one raise his or her hand DURING another person's speech. You
may only do so after the first speaker has stopped. This will show that you
have actually listened to all s/he has had to say.

>

> (5) Do not make personal remarks about others during discussions. I expects
students to disagree on occasion, of course, but these should be intellectual
differences only.

>

> (6) Be careful not to dominate class. You are not graded for the amount of
speaking, but the quality and appropriateness of your comments.

>

> (7) Please use gender-inclusive language (this goes as well for written
work).

>

> These rules are meant to ensure that all students feel free to contribute to
class and to be taken seriously. Without a feeling of safety and acceptance,
no one will want to participate, and the class will be a disappointing bore.

DISCUSSION LEADERSHIP--INSTRUCTIONS

> During the semester, students will lead discussion of the texts six times.
The instructor will pick the groups of two-three students and assign the dates
for their leadership at the beginning of the semester. Students should try to
reach the following goals for this assignment:  
>  (1) Develop discussion questions that engage the text in an analytical
manner;  
>  (2) Use the questions to further the exploration of the history of Modern
England;  
>  (3) Connect the work with those we have read before (when possible);  
>  (4) Engage the class with the text.

>

> Students should not talk more than five minutes about background materials;
in addition, student leaders may not ask for a mere summary of the book.
Instead, the groups should produce questions that discuss complicated issues
and themes that run through the text. Your grade will depend on the following
criteria:

>

> (1) Ability to start a meaningful discussion, including holding students
accountable for the day's assignment;  
>  (2) Rigorous and thoughtful questions;  
>  (3) Willingness to accept other students' comments;  
>  (4) Oral communication skills (such as making eye contact, speaking clearly
and audibly, having an attractive presentation style, showing enthusiasm, and
using visual aids);  
>  (5) Coordination and smoothness in working together;  
>  (6) Creativity.

>

> Groups are not limited to simply standing at the front of the classroom and
asking questions. In fact, **any group that does only that will not receive a
grade higher than a C.** You can develop small groups assignments, games, or
contests to get at the themes of the text and course. You can give the class
quizzes or ask for written work. The only requirement is that you engage the
class as a whole rather than giving speeches. Ten of the fifteen percent of
this grade will come from your leadership.

>

> I do not require research for these discussion days, although you may find
it easier to ask difficult questions if you have learned more about the text
yourself. The only written work you will need to turn in is a list of your
questions. **This must be a coordinated list of all participants, not separate
lists from each person.**

>

> The final five percent of the grade will come from their response to another
group's leadership. Two response groups will be chosen at random on the day
the class first discusses the text. In other words, you will not have any
warning if your group will be the one of the ones expected to respond, so you
must be prepared every day. Just because you have been chosen one day does not
mean you will not be selected again another day. Your readiness to respond and
help with additional questions and comments will determine this part of your
grade. (If your group is never drawn out of the hat, your grade will come
entirely from your presentation).

>

> It is extremely important that students show each other the same courtesy
and attention that they show the instructor. The day other students lead is
not a "day off." If students exhibit behaviors that I find unacceptable on
these days, I will begin instituting quizzes and penalties to improve
deportment.  
>  
>

>  
>

>

> **PAPER TOPICS AND INSTRUCTIONS**

>

> Each student will turn in up to three synoptic papers, due September 19,
October 10, and November 5. ALL students must do the first paper; students may
skip one of the last two (or they may choose to skip the final). Answer the
following questions in a 5-6 page essay:

>

> **PAPER ONE:** The Industrial Revolution had far-reaching effects on all
English people. Considering society, family, and politics, would you say class
or gender was a more important factor on how the Industrial Revolution
effected a person's life in the late 18 th and early 19th century?

>

> **PAPER TWO:** The mid-Victorian period produced two great thinkers: John
Stuart Mill and Charles Darwin. Which was more representative of his era? Why?
[HINT: Keep class and gender in mind here.]

>

> **PAPER THREE:** The Victorian and Edwardian eras saw several challenges to
the mid-Victorian consensus of liberalism and domesticity: secularism, New
Unionism, the Suffragettes, and the Irish rebellion. Which of these movements
was the biggest challenge? Which was the least? Was World War I necessary to
destroy the mid-Victorian consensus, or would these movements have brought it
down anyway?

>

> **HINTS FOR WRITING PAPERS:**

>

> In these papers, you are making an argument. You should state your points
and then back them up with evidence from your readings and the lectures. There
are no right or wrong answers to these questions, but there are some arguments
that are easier to defend than others, since they have more logic and evidence
behind them. Remember, you must try to anticipate and meet any objections to
your points. One of the best ways to do this is to include the reasons you
have NOT chosen some of the other options as well as the reasons you have
chosen the one(s) you have. Of course, you may choose more than one answer or
none of the answers if you wish; as long as you make a convincing argument,
you can be creative. **Please use only the lectures and readings assigned for
the course.**

>

> It is a good rule of thumb to use as many of the readings and lectures as
possible in your essays. It is also a good idea to read the assigned question
before we start on the next section of the course. This will help you to
formulate your essays. Always back up your position with logic and examples
from the readings whenever possible.

>

> Papers should be written in formal English (no use of first or second
person, no contractions, avoid passive voice, etc.). Please use standard ten
or twelve point type, one-inch margins, and double spacing. Double spacing is
approximately 26 lines per page. Some computer software has over 30 lines a
page and calls it double spacing, so count them if you are at all unsure. Any
student turning in a paper in single space or space and a half will be
penalized ten points. I will not read past the end of page six, so do not go
over the limit. And be sure to avoid plagiarism (see pp. 1-2 of the syllabus
for guidelines).

>

> Papers are due at the BEGINNING of class. I will count off ten points a day
for every day a paper is late up to forty points. I will accept no papers that
are more than a week late. You may not collaborate on formal papers with other
students, and they must be original and written specifically for this course.

>

> I will also be happy to read over rough drafts and make suggestions in order
to help you succeed. This does, however, require you to have a draft done
early. Even if you do not have something written, you can come by and discuss
your ideas if you would like. Remember: the most important part of writing
papers for me is thinking through your answer carefully. Good luck!

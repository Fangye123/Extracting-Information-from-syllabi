####  _I have created two Websites as teaching/learning resources. They
represent areas in which I teach, read, and engage in research. One centers on
American History and Communications History through the Civil War Era. The
other attends to Global or World History and is a collaborative effort with
Stockton students. Both also share my love of visual images in historical
understanding._

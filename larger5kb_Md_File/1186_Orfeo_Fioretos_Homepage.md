**DESCRIPTION**

There is an uneasy division in the study of the European Union. Scholars in
comparative politics have made the _national_ (re-)construction of economic
models their primary area of study in post-war Europe, while scholars of
international relations have devoted most of their attention to the
construction of _supranational_ institutions. This course seeks to bridge this
intellectual division and to examine the relationship between the construction
and reform of national economic models and the creation and development of the
European Union. Among the several topics covered in the course are the history
of economic reconstruction and European integration after 1945; the core
institutions of the EU; the three "pillars" and key policy-areas; enlargement;
the "democratic deficit" and legitimacy; as well as contemporary debates about
the desirability and form of a European constitution.

**REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING**

Final grades will be computed as follows: a mid-term exam (30%); a short
reflection paper (20%); section performance (10%); and a final exam (40%).
Sections are mandatory and more than 3 undocumented absences will result in a
failing grade. Your TA will give you more information on what is expected from
you in sections.

**LISTSERVE**

All students registered for the course are automatically subscribed to a
listserve/classlist that is maintained by the DoIT. For the purposes of
facilitating discussion in the class and sharing resources, you are strongly
encouraged to circulate questions and suggestions on this listserve
(ps338-f01@lists.students.wisc.edu). ****_Every member should regularly check
messages posted to the listserve._

you should regularly read newspapers and periodicals that include analytical
coverage on Europe. Easily available and highly recommended are _The

**SOME GENERAL COURSE POLICIES**

Since this is a large class, here are some commonsense course policies that I
will adhere to consistently in order to ensure fairness and equal opportunity
for all members of the class. If you have any questions about these policies,
please ask me or your TA for clarification.

  * Make sure to attend class and take notes. Material covered in lectures (and that may not be part of the readings) will be included in your exams. If you miss a class, make sure to get notes from someone who attended class.

  * Make-up exams or extra credit assignments will not be offered. Dates for exams are listed on the syllabus. If you have conflicts, please clear them now. Exceptions to this rule will only be made in cases of (1) unexpected and serious sickness or injury; (2) serious family emergencies; and (3) membership in an official University society or team that is out of town on the day of the exam. In all cases you must provide documentation.

  * If you have questions regarding content or analysis during lecture, I strongly encourage you to raise them.

  * I work closely with the staff of the Disabled Students' Office to help my students when they need it. Therefore, if you have a disability that requires particular attention, please inform me of it at the very earliest so that I can make arrangements to accommodate your needs.

  * Be respectful of your fellow students. If you arrive late or must leave early, please seat yourself quietly at the back of the lecture hall. If someone engages in disruptive activities during class, please understand that I will ask you to leave the room. If you have a cell phone, make sure to turn it off before entering the lecture hall.

**NOTE ON ACADEMIC CONDUCT**

I will expect every member of this class to adhere to the highest standards of
academic honesty. You must fully and unambiguously cite all work that is not
your own in written assignments and give credit to those whose ideas or
language you are using. Failure to do so constitutes plagiarism, whose penalty
may include failing the course and academic dismissal. Similarly, turning in
parts of someone else's work, cheating during the exams, or giving answers to
others during the exam may also result in a failing grade and academic
dismissal. Given the seriousness of these infractions, they come with no
second chances and no leniency. Please avoid them at any cost. If you are ever
in doubt, please make sure to consult your professor or TA. You may also
consult the Academic Misconduct Guide for Students. Advice for citing sources
may be found on my website.

Description:** This course introduces you to major political, economic, and
social changes in the United States from the time of European "discovery" to
the Civil War. It will help you to develop analytical skills [not just what
happened, but some of the reasons why] as well as learning how to articulate
your ideas both verbally and in writing. We will look at major events such as
the American Revolution, the Market Revolution, and the growth of sectional
tensions from the point of view of the ordinary American.

At the end of this course students will be able to:

> _

>

> Recognize_ the major events and people in American history through 1865  
>  _Analyze_ primary source documents and understand why this is an important
skill  
>  _Articulate and support_ (on exams, papers, and in class discussions) a
sound position on an historical topic  
>  _Compare_ historical events from the perspective of different groups and
account for any variation

Grading/Requirements***:

1) You will have 3 blue book exams in lecture. These exams will cover content
from the textbook, Boller, lecture, and discussion. Exam format may include
essays, identifications, mapping, and chronologies. Each exam will be worth
20% of your final grade for a total of approximately 60%.

2) You will have 3 short answer/multiple choice reading quizzes in your
discussion section. These quizzes will cover content from the textbook and
Boller. Each quiz will be worth approximately 10% of your final grade. I will
count your 2 highest scores for a total of approximately 20% of your final
grade. **There will be no make-up quizzes.

**

3) You will write one short paper, 3-5 pages typed, on the slave narrative of
either Frederick Douglass or Harriet Jacobs. The paper will be worth
approximately10% of your final grade.

4) Your attendance and participation will make up the final 10% of your grade.
Participation requires both your general attendance and contributions to the
discussion section. The teaching assistant and I will periodically assign
short miscellaneous assignments as a part of this grade.

* In the calculation of the semester grade, improvement over the course of the semester is an important consideration and can raise the final grade above the mathematical average. Every effort will be made to return all work within one week or by the 3rd class meeting after it is collected. Papers may take up to 2 weeks. 

**

Course Policies**:

**

Attendance:** You are expected to attend all class meetings (as per new
university policy, attendance will be taken) and to complete the readings
before the first class meeting each week. Attendance and participation are
assigned as a part of your grade. After three absences you will begin to lose
points. If you will be gone for job related requirements, sporting events,
doctor's appointments, illness, etc. use these three "free" absences. Lecture
and discussion are counted separately for attendance purposes.

Any absences after three (a combined total from lecture and discussion) will
only be excused at the instructor's discretion and in extreme circumstances
(hospitalizationBnot merely a doctor's appointment, death in the family, etc.)
and with appropriate documentation. Please do not e-mail me telling me you
will be absentBthat is why you get three freebies. After three absences, if
you feel that you have extenuating circumstances warranting an excuse, please
come and see me in person during office hours. **More than 6 absences may
result in an F for this class**.

**

Due Dates: **All assignments/papers are due at the beginning class. Late
assignments will lose one-third of a grade for each day they are late,
including weekends and holidays. Make-ups and late papers are allowed only in
exceptional circumstances with appropriate documentation. Students who for
extraordinary reasons cannot meet a deadline should discuss their situation
with the instructors **before the due date**.

**

Oncourse/E-mail**: Please familiarize yourself with the Oncourse system that
is maintained by the University and accessible from the IUPUI homepage. I will
post announcements, assignments, extra credit ideas, hand outs to be printed
and brought to class, and other important information at this site. It is your
responsibility to check Oncourse on a regular basis. The system also allows
you to easily contact me and your classmatesByou simply click on a person's
name in order to send them an e-mail.

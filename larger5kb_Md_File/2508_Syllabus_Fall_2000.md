>  Tuesdays & Thursdays

>>>  
>>> ---|---  
>>>  
>>> This course is designed for declared history majors with junior standing,
and is limited to those history juniors (or declared American Studies juniors
with a history concentration) who have completed two previous courses in
history at Reed College.  
>

>>>

>>> The Great Depression (1929-1941) was a watershed event of the twentieth
century. Students will explore a range of secondary texts and primary
documents that focus on key events and different historical approaches to the
study of this era. Topics include the expansion of executive power under
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, the establishment of federal programs and
agencies to deal with the effects of the Depression (commonly known as "the
New Deal") and the growth of labor unions. We will also examine political and
popular culture in this period, including documentary photography produced
under the auspices of federal programs, commercial radio, and Hollywood
movies.  
>

>>>

>>> The main task of students in this seminar is to pay close attention to how
the authors employ various sources, including census data, letters and
diaries, oral history testimony, social scientific surveys, to support their
arguments. The readings, library seminars, Junior Seminar Web site and
tutorial, and my occasional lectures, are meant to prepare students to design
and research a topic, compose a selected bibliography and review essay, and
write and revise a thirty (30)-page research paper by the end of this term.
You will read course material and undertake their own research for the first
eight weeks of the course, then spend the remaining weeks writing, revising
and presenting your research at different stages. You will be graded on your
participation in discussions, bibliography and historiographical review essay,
and final paper. Class participation will include serving as editor for one of
your classmates' rough drafts, and your short oral presentation on your
argument to be scheduled for the final weeks of the course.

>>> Please note that this course is part of the Mellon Library Research
Project, which is a collaborative effort between members of the History and
Social Sciences faculty and the Reed College Library. This project is designed
to familiarize Reed students with library research methods and sources in
preparation for thesis research during the senior year. As a part of this
project, a series of four workshops on library research have been incorporated
into this course, and a web site has been created to assist students in
researching and writing the History junior seminar paper. The intent of the
project is not to add to the already considerable academic requirements of the
History junior seminar, but to help students who are writing the seminar paper
to locate and access needed research materials in an effective and timely
manner.

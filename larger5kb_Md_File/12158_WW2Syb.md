**Course Description:** This course offers a survey of World War II, the
largest and most destructive armed conflict in human history, with coverage of
its causes and consequences. It utilizes the prism of grand strategy to
analyze national policy and military strategy. In addition to detailed
descriptions of major military operations, the course will assess the impact
that Adolph Hitler, Benito Mussolini, Winston S. Churchill, Joseph Stalin, and
Franklin D. Roosevelt had on the war. While this course emphasizes military
events and wartime diplomacy, some attention will be paid to the internal
politics of the major belligerents and economic factors. There are no
prerequisites for this course.

**Semester Grade:** The student's final grade will be based on the total
number of points earned in two exams (100 points apiece, or 200 points,
total), a book review and a review essay (100 points apiece, or 200 points,
total), two computer exercises (25 points apiece, 50 points, total), and three
quizzes (50 points apiece, or 150 points, total). Class attendance and
participation will also affect the grade. It is up to any student who misses a
test or quiz to schedule a make-up session.  


**Book Review Assignment:** In addition to the main text and four collateral
readings, each student is expected to read an additional book dealing with
different aspects of World War II and submit a written review of the same. The
title for one of these reviews may be chosen from a reading list provided by
Dr. Urwin on his web site. Students may choose any book found on this list.

The review should be typed (in 10- or 12-point font), double-spaced, and five
to seven pages long. This written assignment must be carefully proofread, as
spelling, grammar, and punctuation will have an important effect on your
grade.

_The book review should be accompanied by the printout of some article from an
Internet web site that pertains in some way to the book that you have
reviewed_.

For detailed tips on what is expected in your reviews, see the separate guide
on Dr. Urwin's web site.  


**Finding a Book for Your Book Review:** The Paley Library here at Temple has
a strong military history collection. You should be able to find many of the
books listed on the reading list there. If there is a particular title that
you want to read, check it out early. If the Paley Library does not have it,
you should be able to order a copy via interlibrary loan - provided you do not
wait until the last minute. If you find a promising World War II title that is
not in the Paley Library and really want to read it, you may bring it to Dr.
Urwin for his approval. If you have any trouble picking a suitable title, feel
free to consult with Dr. Urwin.  


**Review Essay:** The other major written assignment concerns a book to be
read by everyone in class -- a study of the Holocaust -- _Ordinary Men:
Reserve Police Battalion 101 and the Final Solution in Poland_ by Christopher
R. Browning. This essay can be a book review in part. Feel free to summarize
the contents of this book, its literary quality, and the success or failure of
the author in researching and interpreting the past. In addition to all that,
feel free to explore your personal feelings about the Holocaust. What do you
think this book says about human nature? Why did Germany, a country so
renowned for its advanced culture and technological achievements, adopt such
monstrous racial policies? Why did ordinary, ostensibly decent men, men
supposedly steeped in Christian values and morality, willingly participate in
the "final solution"? Could such a thing ever happen again? Who might be the
victims of a new Holocaust? Feel free to use your imagination and be creative.
Nevertheless, you must observe the same high standards in spelling, grammar,
and proper sentence and paragraph structure as expected for the book review.
_You must also find some Internet web site dealing with some aspect of the
Holocaust and attach printouts of at least some of its content to your review
essay._  


**Academic Honesty Statement:** Students are expected to do their own work on
all exams, quizzes, and other exercises. Anyone caught cheating in class
and/or plagiarizing material in the book reviews will fail the course. _The
American Heritage Dictionary_ defines plagiarism as: "1. To steal and use the
ideas and writings of another as one's own. 2. To appropriate passages or
ideas from another and use them as one's own."  


**Americans with Disabilities Act Statement:** Temple University adheres to
requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. If you need an
accommodation under this Act due to a disability, contact Disability Resources
and Services at 204-1280 or 11280.  


**Some Basic Regulations**  


1) No food, liquids, or tobacco products may be consumed in class.

2) It is a sign of poor manners for men to wear hats or caps indoors (except
for religious reasons). All students will remove any headgear with brims or
bills for tests and quizzes.

3) Anyone leaving class after an exam or quiz (i.e., cutting the lectures
after these exercises) will fail that particular exercise.

4) If you must miss class for some foreseeable reason, have the courtesy to
notify the instructor in advance.

5) Anyone caught cheating will flunk the course.

6) Students who disrupt class will be liable to punitive quizzes that may
lower their grades. Persistent misbehavior can lead to expulsion or other
disciplinary action.

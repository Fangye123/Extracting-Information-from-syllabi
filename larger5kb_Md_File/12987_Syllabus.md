**2\. January 31, 2000 - Roots of Modern City Planning**  
Although Cities have existed since the dawn of civilization, city planning as
it is practiced today in the U.S. is a recent phenomenon, tracing its roots to
the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In this section we will examine the
historical context that set in motion modern city planning and the legacy of
the seminal planning thinkers. In this section we will discuss the shift in
the orientation of planning from a physical design one to a social science
policy one. We will describe how events of the 1930s-1950s influenced this
shift.

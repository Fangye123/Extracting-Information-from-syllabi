GOALS

_**

This course is an introduction to the intellectual history of the period
between the mid-eighteenth and late nineteenth centuries. It consists of a
careful reading of the philosophical and political works of a number of
important thinkers from the Enlightenment through the mid-Victorian period.
Students will be expected to analyze the works closely to determine their key
aims, arguments, assumptions, and ambiguities, and to assess their
relationship to the political and social contexts of the period.

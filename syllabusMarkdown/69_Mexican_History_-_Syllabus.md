**Description**

This course surveys the history of Mexico from the earliest human inhabitation
to the present. It will present different interpretations of the major themes
and developments in Mexican history. A goal is to understand Mexico from the
perspective of the Mexicans rather than from the point of view of the United
States. It is important to understand, however, that Mexico is not a singular
homogenous entity; there are "many Mexicos." In particular, this course will
emphasize the creation of Mexican identities, the role which Indigenous
peoples have played in that creation, and how that role has changed over time.
How have Indians been turned into Mexicans, and how have Mexicans been turned
in to Indians?

**Requirements**

You are expected and required to attend every class session, and you are
responsible for the material covered in the lectures, readings and films, and
for any announcements made in class. Unexcused absences will negatively affect
your grade. If you have a disability or any conflicts which may affect your
class performance, please bring this to my attention immediately so that we
can make arrangements for this to be a positive learning experience for you.

I reserve the right to modify the syllabus and assignments for this class as
necessary in order to improve the quality and value of the class. If you have
suggestions for improving the class, please bring these to my attention.

**Readings**

There are five required books for this class in addition to other readings at
the reserve desk in Milner library and on the Internet. You may either
purchase the books at campus bookstores or read them at the reserve desk in
Milner Library. Read the assignments before class so that you are prepared to
carry on an intelligent discussion of the material in class. Lectures will
complement the readings and assume the base level of knowledge which they
present, so it is critically important that you keep up with the readings.

**Internet**

This course makes use of a web site (http://www.ilstu.edu/class/hist263) and
Netforum discussion group on the Internet to extend the scope of the class
beyond that of the immediate classroom setting. Class schedule updates,
lecture outlines, additional information on assignments, and other information
related to the class will be posted to the web site. The Netforum discussion
group is designed for the posting of announcements, a forum to ask questions,
continue class discussions, complain about the weather, etc. In addition, I
plan to post a question every week which I encourage you to discuss. This will
count toward your class participation grade (see below). You are expected and
encouraged to make active use of these resources. ISU provides students with
free email accounts and access to computer terminals in labs around campus.
Let me know at the beginning of the semester if access to these resources will
be a problem for you.

**Assignments and grades**

Course grades will be based on the following assignments. Study guides for
each of the exams and more detailed information on the written assignments
will be posted to the web page. Use the Netforum discussion group to discuss
these assignments with your classmates in a relaxed and informal virtual
discussion session.

**Essay** : A three-page essay comparing the depictions of Indians in B.
Traven's _The Rebellion of the Hanged_ and Jos e Vasconcelos' _The Cosmic
Race_ is due on March 27. You may also want to bring some insights from
Guillermo Bonfil Batalla's _M exico Profundo_ into the essay. The essay is to
be typed, double spaced, include citations, and follow good essay form. Later
I will give you a more elaborate description of the questions you should
address in this paper.

**Final project** : Every student is required to write a research paper on a
topic related to Mexican history. The paper must be 10 to 15 pages long, use a
minimum of six scholarly sources, be typed, double spaced, and include
citations and a bibliography. I allow a variety of creative alternatives to
research projects for this assignment (such as short stories, teaching units,
web pages, etc.), but the specific requirements for these _must_ be worked out
individually with me. This project will be developed in a series of stages.
You **_MUST_** meet every one of these deadlines. Failure to do so will result
in no credit for the entire assignment.

  * January 28: Library exercise due (worth 15% of the grade for the project)
  * February 27: Project proposal (also worth 15% of the grade for the project)
  * April 10: First (rough) draft of the project, which must include citations and bibliography
  * May 1: Final project due

I will give you more information on this assignment in class and on the web
page.

**Class participation** : Every student is expected to be an active and
engaged participant in this class. The participation grade can come either
from class discussions or from intelligent and critical postings to the
Netforum discussion group on the web page.

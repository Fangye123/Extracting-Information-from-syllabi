  **Course Goals and Objectives:**

This course has a number of objectives, all of them interrelated. First, it
will provide some coverage of European history from about 1350 to 1530, and
investigate within that context the intellectual and cultural phenomenon known
as the Renaissance. Second, the course, which carries ORC credit, will provide
instruction in the theory and practice of public speaking. I believe this
requirement is a natural fit for a Renaissance course, because public speaking
was an issue of major importance to intellectuals of the Renaissance.

As you will notice, the syllabus falls into two equal parts. The first three
weeks will constitute the historical core of the course, following the Spitz
textbook with associated readings, available on-line. This will be concluded
by a midterm examination to test you on your grasp of basic concepts; it will
be a combination of several short essays and one longer essay. The second
three weeks will utilize the three-volume set from _The Renaissance in Europe_
series: _The Impact of Humanism_ , an Anthology, and a Reader. Also included
in this segment will be readings from Burckhardt's _Civilization of the
Renaissance in Italy_ and Machiavelli's _Prince_. What this sequence will do
is explore certain topics in more depth, using an interdisciplinary approach.
The final examination will address this portion of the course, and will
consist of a choice of several broad essay topics.

For the ORC component of the course, each student will be asked to do three
oral presentations on the readings throughout the term. You will be allowed to
choose when exactly you wish to do this, with the stipulation that the first
should be completed between July 16 and July 26, the second between July 29
and August 9, and the third between August 12 and August 20. I will provide
handouts with explicit instructions about how these are to be handled. Two
reading assignments, from the rhetorical works of Aristotle (July 23) and
Cicero (August 1), shall introduce you to topics in ancient rhetorical theory;
in addition, in-class handouts will address basic issues relating to the
theory of oral communication. All students are expected to participate in
class discussion on a daily basis.

There are also two papers of about three pages each, the first to be completed
in the first segment of the course and the second in the second three weeks.
As with the oral assignments, I will give you more specific information about
these papers in a handout.

Grading will be as follows: papers and oral presentations, 10% each; midterm
and final, 15% each, class grade, 20%. The class grade apart from the oral
assignments is based on a combination of participation and attendance.

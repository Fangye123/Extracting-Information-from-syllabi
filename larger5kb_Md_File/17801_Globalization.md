Dec. 99  
          WTO protesters campaigning for causes ranging from the environment to animal rights clashed with police in Seattle on Tuesday, before being dispersed with CS gas and pepper spray.

**In pictures: The WTO protests** Nov. 99  
  Anarchists, environmentalists, union members, human rights activitsts and
religious groups have descended on Seattle with a common purpose - to protest
against the World Trade Organisation, which is meeting in the American city
this week.  
  An estimated 50,000 anti-WTO activists want to get across their message that
free trade is not fair trade.  
![](a.jpg)  
  Protesters believe the WTO has too much power to advance globalisation at
the expense of democracy. They say WTO pacts can overrule laws enacted by
member nations that protect health, human rights and the environment.  
![](b.jpg)  
  Activists and advocacy groups are concerned that disputes are nutted out
behind closed doors, with no opportunity for appeal.  
![](c.jpg)  
  Environmentalists fear reduced tariffs on paper and wooden furniture will
boost consumer demand, which in turn would intensify deforestation and hurt
wildlife.  
![](d.jpg)  
  The War Resisters League says military spending has been exempt from WTO
rules, creating arms buildups in developing countries.  
    
![](e.jpg)  A protester tries to hand flowers to a police officer during a

developing countries from producing generic drugs to fight AIDS.

  A protester watches the crowds rallying in downtown Seattle. Among the
protesters are Wiccans, feminist neo-pagan lovers of nature and magic, who say
the WTO values free trade over the Goddess.

**_Anti-WTO protesters claim victory_**  4 December, 1999,  
![](1.jpg)  
  Protesters refused to leave Seattle jail until activists were released  
  Thousands of protesters have claimed victory as the World Trade Organisation
failed to reach an agreement in Seattle.  
  Protesters from all walks of life - among them environmentalists,
anarchists, union members and lobbyists from non-governmental organisations \-
took to the streets over the past week to make their concerns heard.  
  Police arrested some 600 protesters in demonstrations that played live on
local television all week and made headlines around the world.  
  The talks ended with delegates from the 135-member WTO at loggerheads over
reducing farm subsidies and introducing labour standards in developing
countries.  
  Activists said their actions deepened divisions between powerful
industrialised nations and developing countries, which threatened not to sign
a deal because they believed rich countries had shut them out of talks.  
![](_549818_boy150.jpg)a boy holds a poster urging an end to child labor

  Zimbabwean delegate Yash Tandon appeared to confirm their claims.  
  "(The talks) failed mainly because the bigger players refused to take into
account the concerns of Africa," he told the BBC.  
  "Africa this time found it necessary to say, 'If you are not going to take
us seriously, then we are not going to be with you.'"  
  System under scrutiny  
  Martin Khor, director of Third World Network, said: "The failure in Seattle
to a large extent reflects the developing countries' unhappiness over how the
system has not benefited them and how they have not been able to participate
fully".  
  Lori Wallach, director of Public Citizens' Global Trade Watch, said:
**"History has been made in Seattle as the allegedly irresistible forces of
corporate economic globalisation were stopped in their tracks."**  
  Environmental groups said the elusive deal would have boosted deforestation
and led to greater trade in genetically modified foods.  
  "The collapse in Seattle affords the WTO the opportunity to take a new
direction toward trade policies that work for the environment," said David
Schorr of World Wildlife Fund.  
  'We won'  
  Protester Sheila Richard said the WTO had to broaden its focus beyond
economic issues.  
  "What I hoped is that the consciousness has been raised a little (by the
protests)," she said.  
  "We won," said Tracy Katelman, an activist from the Alliance for Sustainable
Jobs and the Environment.  
  "We really disrupted it. We certainly created an atmosphere to make it
difficult for them to work."

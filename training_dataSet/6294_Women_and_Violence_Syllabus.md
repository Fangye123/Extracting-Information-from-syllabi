**Course Description** : Violence against (and by) women is accomplished
through a wide range of socially institutionalized and individually
perpetuated political, social, economic, and physical events and
circumstances. Furthermore, violence against (and by) women takes place within
recognizable socially constructed race-ethnicity, gender, sexual preference,
and class specificities, as well as socio-historical contexts. Throughout the
course, we will examine how race-ethnicity, class, gender, sexual orientation,
socio-historical constraints and shifts, and women's complicity with -- as
well as resistance against -- systems of domination and oppression are
interdependent forces. We will look at the ways in which these forces shape
the way women experience economic, social, sexual, class and gender domination
and exploitation. Information covered in this course will situate women and
violence within both national and international contexts.  

**Course Objectives:  
**

  * to understand how violence against and by women is accomplished through a broad range of individual and institutional acts and practices   

  * to examine how race, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, mental and physical ability and other  "social markers" impact manifestations of violence against and by women   

  * to assess the effectiveness of individual and group efforts to reduce the prevalence of violence against women (and men) . to interrogate "the personal as political"; to understand the role of the individual in maintaining or dismantling ongoing systems of domination and exploitation   

**Class Format** : A mixture of lecture and electronic mail discussions and
activities, class discussion, student group presentations, guest lectures and
audiovisuals. Due to the sensitive nature of the subject matter, ground rules
will be established for in-class discussions.  
  
**Requirements** : Regular attendance, timely completion of reading
assignments, quality oral and written class participation, announced and
unannounced quizzes, group presentations, and three examinations (or one exam
and paper submission and presentation at SDSU's "Sixth Annual National
Conference on Campus Sexual Violence" to be held February 19-23).
Additionally, all students are required to subscribe to and actively
participate in the electronic mail listserv (WS496@lists.sdsu.edu) established
for this course.  
  
**Examination Dates** : Mar 4, Apr 15, and May 20.  
  
**Grading Policies/Procedure** : Incomplete grades and make-up examinations
will be given only in exceptional cases. Missed examinations require
officially documented reasons (e.g., authorized medical excuse for day of
exam). Late completion of work may result in a grade reduction. Plus/minus
grading will be used. Final course grades will be computed on a 4.0 scale,
with percentage weights assigned as follows, for a total of 100%:

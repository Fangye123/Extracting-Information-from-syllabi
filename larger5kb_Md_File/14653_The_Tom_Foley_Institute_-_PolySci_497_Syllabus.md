Fall 2002 Internship Assignment  
Political Science 497/498

Part of the experience of completing an internship is to gain work experience
that prepares you for your chosen profession. Likewise, bridging this
practical experience with an "educational" component is where your readings
and papers come in.

Please make sure that you are registered for the right number of credits!  
**YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO ADD THIS COURSE AFTER 3rd WEEK OF CLASSES.**

Required textbooks and readings for the course should be purchased on-line as
soon as possible. Our office does not order them at WSU Bookstore.

**Paper:**  
You should select the topic that most closely matches your internship
experience and with which you are familiar. Your paper must be typed, double-
spaced and depending for how many credits you are registered from 10 pages
(for a 3-credit course) to 25 pages (for a 12-credit course) in length, and
have a minimum of 5 sources. Speak to me about the length of your paper.  
Base your paper on the assigned readings and other professional or scholarly
journals or newspapers. Proper citations are a must. Use APA format. You
should make a copy of your paper and submit the original by mail. You can also
submit an additional copy by electronic mail but make sure that it is in a
format that is easily downloaded. I suggest rich text format. Documents that
are gibberish or unreadable are classified as not submitted.  
The paper must have at minimum five sources. Possible sources can include
national journals or newspapers, such as: Congressional Quarterly, the Wall
Street Journal, NY. Times, etc. Other journals are also acceptable -
Commentary, National Review, New Republic \- be careful though, these have an
ideological slant. Government publications are also acceptable sources. You
may also use Internet sources but care should be taken in citing and
determining that they are legitimate and credible. I prefer government
websites (Thomas.gov),  "think-tank" sources (heritage.org etc.), and media
outlets (cnn.com). Make sure you cite them correctly - I should be able to
"pull them up" without a problem. If not, don't use them. Unfortunately
personal interviews with key representatives, lobbyists, etc. are not
acceptable because in many cases they require special permissions and can be
tricky and time consuming.  
Papers are graded primarily on the content but style, grammar, and form will
count. Carefully proof and edit your paper.  
Papers must have:  
\--A title page  
\--An introduction describing the topic and its importance (this should be
accomplished in the first two paragraphs)  
\--A conclusion discussing what lessons your case study teaches about your
topic.  
\--Bibliography

You should list your sources completely in the bibliography and make
references in the text in parentheses by author, year, and page numbers. For
example, if you wanted to cite welfare reform in a textbook written by L.
Sabato you would put the following (Sabato, 1999, pp.663). A full citing of
books should be listed in the bibliography. Consult a style manual for the APA
guidelines on citing. Do not assume you are doing it correctly.  
Major ideas and quotes taken from the sources must be cited. Failure to do so
is plagiarism and can result in a failure on the paper, class, and academic
expulsion from the University.

**Journal:**  
In addition to your paper you must also write a short (5-10) page journal
about your internship experience.  
This should include:  
\--A description of the daily tasks you performed and highlight significant
learning experiences. You needn't recount a daily log of what you did - make
it a narrative.  
\--Include your thoughts, perceptions, what you liked, didn't like, why you
feel the way you do, and in general terms what you learned, and whether you
believe the internship was a worthwhile experience.  
\--Include some thought on the setting you worked in and how you perceive it
now that you have worked in the institution.  
\--Finally, what are you plans for the future? Do you believe the internship
has helped you professionally toward your goal (if you have one), or somehow
clarified your thinking on a profession?  
  
**Contact information:  
** You must provide me with your address, telephone numbers (home/ work), and
if possible and preferable your email address before you start your
internship. Periodic "checking in" will be done. You are responsible for
submitting other required forms as well. **PLEASE SUBMIT YOUR APPLICATION FORM
to me as soon as possible**.

If you will have any problems at your work place please notify me AND your
supervisor (at the place of your internship) as soon as possible. Please act
professionally and be respectful to your colleagues and supervisors.

**Registering for Credit:**  
It is the responsibility of each student to register for credit (POL SC
497/498). Failure to do so precludes one from gaining credit. This office will
neither register students nor retroactively assign credits. If you have
questions regarding this department policy please speak to the intern
coordinator.

Topic one: Policy Analysis  
1\. The books you are responsible for reading are:

Agendas, Alternatives, and Policies, by John Kingdon. 2nd edition (1995)  
Policy Paradox: The Art of Political Decision Making, by Debra Stone 2nd
edition (1997)  
Beyond Machiavelli: Policy Analysis Comes of Age, by Beryl Radin (2000)  
(Supplement with at least 2 recent journal or newspaper articles)

2\. Select a national public policy topic that is of personal interest,
preferably one you worked on this legislative session and is being (or was)
considered by the Congress and President. (Examples include but are not
limited to Social Security reform, handgun purchase restrictions, patient's
bill of rights, tax reform etc.). The topic is of your discretion (with my
approval) but it must have been seriously considered in Congress and either
adopted or not adopted. The paper should trace how the issue proceeded through
the policy process and should include the following stages outlined below.
Students are responsible for selecting an issue topic and having it approved
by Monday, September 16, 2002.

3\. In your paper, consider the different stages of the policy process, and
attempt to answer each of the following questions:

**a**. The Policy Agenda: How did this problem become part of the government
agenda? What role did linkage institutions such as public opinion, the media,
political parties, elections, or interest groups play in putting this issue on
the agenda?  
**b.** Policy Formation: How did the proposed policy address the public
problem? In other words, what would this policy do or what was it supposed to
do? How was it formulated and by whom? (For example, by the Governor,
Legislature, the bureaucracy, interest groups, etc.)  
**c.** Policy Adoption: Describe the politics surrounding the consideration of
this policy. Who were the key actors (legislators, interest groups, agency
officials, the Governor, etc.) involved in determining whether the policy was
adopted or was not adopted? What role did other factors such as public opinion
and the political environment play in the outcome?  
**d.** Policy Implementation and impact: If the policy was adopted, how was it
carried out, and what is its likely effect on society? If the policy was not
adopted, what are some of the potential consequences of its failure on
society?

4\. You are encouraged to express your own opinions in the conclusion, but the
assignment - your assessment of a policy -- is to be as objective as possible.
Do not write an editorial or diatribe slamming the President, Congress, the
Republicans, or Democrats. (I know this can be tempting and fun but resist it,
if you must, do it in your journal.) Write the paper as a neutral social
scientist trying to explain and analyze why a certain policy was/was not
adopted and why politics and institutions shaped that particular solution to a
problem.  

  
Topic two: Congress, the President, and Divided Government  
Many pundits and scholars decry divided government and advocate unified
government. The "gridlock" and unworkable relations between the executive and
legislative branches is the result, they argue of divided government. Write a
paper on the relations between the Congress and the President. Use the
following readings as the basis of your paper.

Divided Government, Morris Fiorina (1996)  
The President and Congress: Combat and Collaboration in National Policymaking,
Leloup and Shull (1998).  
(Supplement with at least 3 recent journal or newspaper articles)

Students are responsible for selecting an issue topic and having it approved
by Monday, September 16, 2002.

1\. Select a policy topic i.e. Social Security reform, the budget, gun
control, partial birth abortion or etc. Examine both the President's and
Congress' policy proposals. Determine how they are similar / different, and
the major points of contention - or sticking points. Explain why are these
points so contentious?  
2\. Explain the results of these differences. Was an agreement reached or not?
From your research and perspective working in politics, what were the reasons
for this outcome? If there is evidence that supports your conclusion provide
it.  
3\. Describe the political wrangling or various positions taken by the
Congress and the President that you believe are important to the end result of
passage or failure. Were the two sides irreconcilable from the beginning? Was
there a transforming event that spurred on compromise? How did future
elections influence the proposals and policy outcome?  
4\. From your understanding of the readings, what are the consequences of
divided government in general and in the chosen policy area? How would the
outcome be different under unified government? If the current trend toward
divided government continues what are the likely consequences on American
politics? (What do the readings say? And how are your thoughts different - if
they are?)  
  
Topic three: Elections  
Congressional reelection rates are in the 90% range. Proposals to reform
campaign financing have circled around Washington for several years but none
have been adopted. It is likely that while incumbents dislike fundraising they
are grateful for the advantages their office affords. Write a paper on
campaigns (Senatorial or Congressional). Begin by reading the following books
and examining the two web pages.

The Politics of Congressional Elections. Gary Jacobson (4thed) (1996)  
The Money Chase, Congressional Campaign Finance Reform. Magleby and Nelson
(1990)  
Party Politics in America. Paul Allen Beck (8th ed) (1997)  
(Supplement with at least 2 recent journal or newspaper articles)  
Note: These two reference pages include financial disclosure and other
information about candidates that is necessary for this paper.
http://www.fec.gov/ and http://www.vote-smart.org/

Students are responsible for selecting an issue topic and having it approved
by Monday, September 16, 2002.  
You paper should consider the questions below.  
1\. Outline the structure of your campaign office and candidate's politics,
political vulnerabilities, and status (incumbent/challenger). Briefly describe
the opponent in relation to your candidate.  
2\. What were the principal sources of income for your candidate i.e. private
contributions, PAC's (what kind of PAC's?, their party, personal funds, in-
kind contributions, and etc.(be specific in dollar amounts raised to date)?
Where and at what time during the campaign was this money spent (i.e. TV,
etc)?  
3\. Outline the strategy of the campaign. Where did the candidate focus energy
and effort to court voters (i.e. rural, urban, suburban, ethnic voters, etc.?
Specifically, what did the candidate do to attract voters? Gain the attention
of the media? Did the campaign seek to garner support from the other political
party or independents? Why and why not?  
4\. What was the theme of the campaign and how was it framed? (This varies for
incumbents and challengers. Explain the strategy to frame the campaign theme.)
Have the messages been positive or negative? If negative at what point in the
campaign did "it" go negative and why? Be specific. Assess the effectiveness
of this strategy - did it work? Yes or no, support your answer with poll
numbers or other data.  
5\. What affect did the candidate's previous votes, positions, politics,
vulnerabilities, national political mood, and status have on the organization
of the campaign, fundraising, strategies, and etc.?  
6\. Finally, assess the time-spent fundraising, the impact this constraint
places on talking about issues, and the consequences (intended and unintended)
of fundraising to campaigns and our political system as a whole.  
  
Topic four: Courts (for student in law firms, district attorneys offices,
etc.)  
Plea-bargaining has become a routine facet of the American legal system. Some
argue that its practice allows criminals to get away with more serious
infractions of the law while others argue that it's unfair to the prosecuted
because they are often coerced into accepting a plea. Write a paper on why
plea-bargaining is so pervasive in American society. Begin by reading the
following books.

American Courts: Process and Policy, by Lawrence Baum (1998)  
Politics of plea bargaining: Victim's rights in California / by Candace McCoy
(1993)  
Plea bargaining and guilty pleas / by James E. Bond (1982)  
Inside plea bargaining : the language of negotiation / Douglas W. Maynard
(1984)  
( Supplement with at least 2 recent journal or newspaper articles)

Your paper should include an examination of the following questions. Is plea-
bargaining unfair and/or irrational? Why is it so pervasive in our society?
Why have efforts at elimination of plea-bargaining been unsuccessful?  
In writing this paper you must select a high profile case in order to focus
your attention and argument.

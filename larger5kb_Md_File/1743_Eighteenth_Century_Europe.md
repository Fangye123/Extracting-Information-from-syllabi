**Course Description:**      History 314 is an introduction to Western
European history in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. The course
focuses on central themes and issues in the early modern period, and the close
inter-relationship between political systems, economic theories, institutional
changes, cultural developments, and religious beliefs. Themes treated in this
course include innovations in economic theory and practice; social
classifications and their impact on political and cultural norms; the rise of
absolutism and constitutionalism as the dominant European political forms; and
the tremendous intellectual impact of the Enlightenment.

**Meetings:**      This class meets every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday
throughout the semester. Most class meetings centre on a lecture, but students
are encouraged to discuss the material during class. Participation in class is
the best way to refine your comprehension of the issues in the class. Perfect
attendance is not required, but the professor reserves the right to lower the
course grade of any student who has demonstrated apathy through repeated
absences. Furthermore, exam questions tend to be drawn from the themes of the
lectures and discussions, so regular attendance is often rewarded through
better exam grades.

**Readings:**      The reading assignments are listed below. For each day in
the semester there are lecture titles and assigned readings. The readings are
to be read in full before the first day for which they are listed. Each
assignment should be read not just to determine the author's thesis and note
facts, but also to consider critically the validity and logic of the argument.

It is expected that a student will not attend any class session for which he
has not completed the assigned readings. In order to determine who has
prepared for class, the instructor reserves the right to give unannounced
quizes at any time during the semester. Doing well on a quiz will result in
extra consideration being granted a student when the final course grades are
computed. Failing any quiz will result in a reduction of a student's final
course grade by 5%.

**Examinations:**      Students will be required to take a midterm and a final
examination. The midterm examination will be a take-home assignment,
consisting of essay questions. It will be distributed at the end of class on
11 March and will be due no later than the beginning of class on 22 March. No
examinations will be accepted after class has begun on 22 March.

The final examination will also be a take-home assignment, consisting of
comprehensive essay questions. It will be distributed at the end of class on 8
December and will be due no later than 11 December at 6.00 PM. No examinations
will be accepted after 6.00 PM on 11 December.

If, for any reason, you find it absolutely necessary to miss either
examination, you must contact the instructor before the examination and have
his permission if you wish to take a make-up examination.

**Research Term Paper:**      A research term paper must be submitted to
receive credit for this course. Each student will, in consultation with the
instructor, prepare an essay which offers a critical summary of the condition
of one Western European country or national region during the eighteenth
century. To encourage students to distill their writing in a careful manner,
the completed paper may be no more than ten pages in length, exclusive of
front and end matter. No two students may select the same country, and
selections will be distributed on a first come, first served basis.

The essay should embrace themes appropriate to the country under
consideration, themes which might include foreign relations and war, religious
tensions and dissent, political forms and pressures, economic patterns and
problems, nationalism and ethnic minorities, and similar topics.

The final copy of the paper is due no later than 29 April at the beginning of
class. Ten points will be deducted from papers received after the beginning of
class on 29 April. Twenty points will be deducted from papers received on 30
April. No papers will be accepted after 30 April.

Errors of fact, style, and mechanics are prima facie evidence of a lack of
concern and effort, and thus will affect your grade. Moreover, such errors
impair your ability to communicate your research, and so compromise the
quality of your paper. Papers are to be typed, double-spaced, and written in
clear, correct English.

Students are strongly urged to contribute any relevant research to class
discussions as opportunities present themselves.

**Research Bibliography:**      All students are required to prepare and
submit no later than 1 March at 1.00 PM a comprehensive bibliography of
resources at Hillsdale College which are related to the theme chosen for their
term paper. Note that this is not simply a bibliography of books in Mossey
Library, but a thorough compilation of resources which are relevant - videos,
electronic media, scholarly and popular journals, reference works and finding
aids, and other resources in or beyond the confines of the library. Note also
that it is not expected that in writing his paper the student will consult
all, nor even many, of the sources he lists. It is expected, however, that the
student will investigate the holdings of Hillsdale College sufficiently to
appreciate what is available and to make informed selections for the
composition of the paper.

**Geography:**      Students are expected to achieve a basic familiarity with
the major towns, regions, and geographic features of the Early Modern world.
To ensure that students become and remain competent in basic geography,
unannounced, in-class map exams will be given throughout the semester. All
elements of the map exams will be selected from the list below. Please note
that for some of these names there exists no standardized spelling, thus
locating some may be challenging. If you need any assistance in finding the
locations below, please contact the instructor - your inability to locate any
of these places is not an acceptable excuse for not knowing its location.

London - Bristol - Edinburgh - Paris - Lyons - Marseilles - Toulon - Brest -
Madrid - Barcelona - Cadiz - Rome - Naples - Florence - Venice - Genoa -
Berlin - Vienna - Copenhagen - Warsaw - Istanbul - Moscow - Geneva - Amsterdam
- Rotterdam - Brussels - Athens - Avignon - St. Petersburg - Dublin - Prague -

**Grades:**      Listed below is a description of the scale by which work
submitted in this class will be judged. Note that this is a general set of
guidelines, not an inflexible measure. The course grades of those students who
fulfill all the requirements for the course will be computed using the
following scale as an approximate guide:

Map Exams - 10%  
Final Examination - 30%  
Class Participation - 10%  
Research Term Paper - 20%  
Midterm Examination - 20%  
Research Bibliography - 10%

As noted above, however, the instructor may alter the distribution of the
grades if a student's attendance, motivation, or effort warrant some change.
Students who do not take the final or midterm, or who do not turn in a term
paper will not receive credit for the course. In addition, plagiarism or any
other form of academic misconduct will result in failure of the course, and
may result in dismissal from the college.

**A Excellent** \- The A answer possesses a clear thesis statement, and
explicitly and thoroughly addresses every component of the question in a very
well-organized essay. It uses well-chosen examples from a variety of readings
to illustrate the points being made, and shows exactly how these selections
are relevant to the thesis. There are no grammatical or stylistic mistakes,
nor any errors of fact in the essay. The excellent answer consistently
reflects synthetic thinking and a firm understanding of the themes and topics
of the course.

**B Good** \- The B answer possesses a clearly defined thesis which pointedly
addresses the question. The reponse explicitly addresses the significant
components of the question in a well-organized essay, but is uneven in
coverage, is unclear at some point, lacks some important detail, or possesses
some weakness in the organization. It uses several well-chosen readings to
illustrate the points being made, but omits a significant illustration, fails
on occasion to show clearly how the readings are related to the thesis, or
neglects to illustrate some key topic. There are few grammatical or stylistic
mistakes, nor any errors of fact in the essay. The good answer reflects
synthetic thinking and an understanding of the themes and topics of the
course.

**C Average** \- The C answer possesses a vague, implicit, or incomplete
thesis which does not offer a complete reponse to the question. The response
addresses the significant components of the question in an organized essay,
but demonstrates an incomplete understanding of the material through such
mistakes as erroneous chronologies, faulty causal arguments, poor
organization, incomplete answers, unclear reasoning, or lack of significant
details. The most common characteristic of C answers is that they discuss
generally the subject of the question, rather than pointedly answering the
question itself. It uses several examples from the readings to illustrate the
points being made, but omits significant material, fails to show how an
example is related to the thesis, does not illustrate key assertions, or uses
irrelevant documents. There are some stylistic and grammatical errors, and no
significant errors of fact in the essay. The average answer recognizes themes
and topics of the course, but demonstrates little synthetic thought or
mastery.

**D Poor** \- The D answer often lacks a thesis, or possesses only an unclear
or extremely vague thesis. The response addresses only some components of the
question, lacks a cogent organization, or uses many unsubstantiated
generalizations. It uses very few readings as examples, mis-quotes significant
passages, does not relate the readings to the thesis, or uses completely
inappropriate examples. There are many stylistic and grammatical errors, and
some minor errors of fact in the essay. The poor answer demonstrates through
omission, poor logical constructions, and mistakes of fact a clear lack of
familiarity with the themes and topics of the course, and lacks synthetic
thought.

**E Failing** \- The E answer fails to address a substantial portion of the
question or makes egregious errors of fact which suggest a profound lack of
understanding. It is replete with grammatical and stylistic errors. The
failing answer demonstrates a complete ignorance of key themes and topics of
the course.

**Style:**      All assignments must follow the style set forth in Turabian's
A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations. When you use
the ideas of others, you must so indicate in a footnote or endnote;
paranthetical references are unacceptable. If one uses the ideas or words of
others without acknowledgement, one is guilty of plagiarism; ignorance of the
rules governing plagiarism and academic misconduct will not excuse any student
from punishments following from violations of the honour code.

**Due Dates:**      All assignments are due on or before the date specified in
the syllabus, and all reading is to be completed before the day for which it
is listed. Only in the most exceptional situations should students consider
requesting an extension on any assignment. Any student who honestly feels that
he needs an extension as a result of reasons completely beyond his control may
request in writing an extension. The request should clearly indicate why an
extension is desired, and specify an exact date and time by which the extended
assignment will be submitted. Please note that social obligations, mechanical
malfunctions, and lack of foresight are not acceptable reasons for requesting
extensions. Granting an extension to one student is not equivalent to offering
an extension to any other student, nor even a suggestion that one may be
granted to another student, even under identical conditions.

**COURSE OBJECTIVES:**

The primary objective of this course is to provide students with the
fundamental knowledge of physical and rheological properties that is needed
for the engineering design of systems used in the processing, storage and
handling of biological materials. A second objective is to provide students
with an opportunity to master communicative and technical writing skills by
submitting weekly technical reports complete with summary, objectives,
methodology, and presentation of results following rules of convention for
tabular and graphical data presentation. A third objective is to train
students in the use of modern computational and experimental testing equipment
such as, state-of-the-art universal testing machine, air comparison
pycnometer, and computer data acquisition and analysis with spreadsheet
software.

**Academic Honesty**

 As a result of completing the registration form at the University of Florida,
every student  
has signed the following statement: "I understand that the University of
Florida expects its  
students to be honest in all their academic work. I agree to adhere to this
commitment to  
academic honesty and that my failure to comply with this commitment may result
in  
disciplinary action up to and including expulsion from the University." The
following  
information will be placed on examinations.  
 "On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this  
 Examination".

  **Use of Library, Personal References, PC Programs and Electronic Data
Bases**

These items are university property and should be utilized with other users  
in mind.  Never remove, mark, modify nor deface resources that do not  
belong to you.  If you're in the habit of underlining text, do it only on  
your personal copy.  It is inconsiderate, costly to others, and dishonest  
to use common references otherwise.

  **Software Use**

All faculty, staff and students of the University are required and expected  
to obey the laws and legal agreements governing software use.  Failure to  
do so can lead to monetary damages and/or criminal penalties for the  
individual violator.  Because such violations are also against University  
policies and rules, disciplinary action will be taken as appropriate.  
 We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold  
 ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honesty and integrity.  


**UF Counseling Services**

I hope to establish a class relationship and encourage dialog so that  
students feel comfortable discussing academic problems directly with me.  
Resources are available on-campus for students having personal problems or
lacking clear  
career and academic goals which interfere with their academic performance.
These  
resources include:

1\. University Counseling Center, 301 Peabody Hall, 392-1575, personal and
career  
counseling;  
2\. Student Mental Health, Student Health Care Center, 392-1171, personal
counseling;  
3\. Sexual Assault Recovery Services (SARS), Student Health Care Center,
392-1161,  
sexual counseling;  
4\. Career Resource Center, Reitz Union, 392-1601, career development
assistance and  
counseling.

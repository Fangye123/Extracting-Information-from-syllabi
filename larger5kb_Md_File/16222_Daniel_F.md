{\fs24\noproof0 A few years ago, Richard Lederer put together an essay called
"The World According to Student Bloopers," a collage of mistakes that he and
his coll eagues had collected over the years from student essays, eighth grade
through college level. Though humorous, the essay dramatizes how tragically
incomplete American students' knowledge of history is. From "Sir Francis Drake
[who] circumcised the world w i th his 200 foot clipper" to "the Spanish
gorillas [who] came down from the hills and nipped at Napoleon's flanks,"
American students demonstrated not only their linguistic limitations but their
historical ignorance as well (Lederer 1999). Part of the diff iculty here may
be the way we have been teaching history for years. \par Americans are
notoriously ignorant of history\\_\\_their own and others': "The problem with
American culture is not, as Christopher Lasch (1978) argues, narcissism, but
amnesia" (Thomas 1991). Even though the subject, though no longer called
"History" in our secondary schools but "Social Studies," is taught at all
levels of elementary and secondary school, it is largely a hodgepodge of
various social sciences. What passes for "history" is a ser ies of facts
memorized easily and regurgitated quickly on multiple\\_choice tests: "most
[college] students view history as an ordering of already\\_known facts into
agreed\\_ upon chronologies. For many of them, in fact, history is facts, with
issues of interpret ation scarcely arising at all" ( Gardner 1991). To
understand history is to know the perspective of the other, being able to get
"inside" as an "outsider," being able to attain an emic perspective.
"Understanding" is coming to make sense of the "facts"\\_ \\_the people and
the events\\_\\_by placing them in their contexts\\_\\_ their times, places,
and circumstances. In literary studies, too, the New Criticism took literature
out of context. In an attempt to focus on the work as an aesthetic object, New
Criticism failed to allow for the kind of understanding defined above. This,
along with the rise of disciplinary specialization in the late nineteenth
century greatly increased the gap between [history and literature]" (Thomas
1991). \par We start with the assumption that the study of history informs the
reading of literature, that history makes us better readers because it puts
the cultural artifact-\\_\\-the text\\_\\_ into an historical context. Marxist
critics called for such an approach long ago in response to New Critics: said
Fredrick Jameson, "Always Historicize! " (Jameson 1981). We agree with New
Historicists that the parallel reading of "literary" and "non\\_ literary"
texts from the same period offers insight into both texts that cannot be
gained from other theoretical perspectives. This does not privilege the
"literary" text (history is "used" to read literature) any more than it
privileges the "non\\_ literary" text (literature is "used" to give the
historical text context and interest). In fact, we have found that our
students tend to learn history more easily when it is connected to literature
and "personalized" in a way that a textbook cannot. But they also read
literature in a much more profound and interesting way when they know its
historical context. \par }\pard \ql

{\fs24\noproof0 Even classic work s, that have been taught in English courses
for years, have often been been taught ahistorically, to the great loss of
understanding of the work. E.M. Forster's }{\i\fs24\noproof0 A Passage to
India }{\fs24\noproof0 (1924), for example, set in the 1920s, chronicles the
difficulties of achie ving friendship between an Englishman, Fielding, and an
Indian, Aziz. It is important to note that although this novel has been taught
fairly regularly in literature classes in the United States, by no means are
US students necessarily familiar with eithe r English or Indian history. It
has been read as a novel about personal relations between people. Critics, of
course, have discussed the historical implications of the novel, especially in
New Historicist and Cultural Studies. But many teachers of underg raduates
have focused on other aspects, in part, because of a lack of knowledge on the
part of students\\_ -or perhaps on the part of the professorate, trained in
their own specialty and knowing very little indeed about areas outside their
own fields of interest. \par }\pard\plain \s24\ql

our honors students for the past four years what new insights they had gained

the Raj or about Indian history; they believed, if they b elieved anything,
the stereotypes about India as a place of Hindus, cobra-charmers, the Taj

simply found it easier to focus on other aspects of the novel rather than
trying to " correct" years of bad training in history. \par }\pard\plain \ql

\fs20\lang1024\langfe1024\cgrid\noproof\langnp1033\langfenp1033 {\fs24 Part of
the difficulty lay with the history textbooks themselves. Few of the general
survey texts touched on the kinds of contemporary reports that historians
themselves have access to. And it is these primary sour ces that help modern
readers place the fiction in the context of the time period in which it was
written. Although the is changing, as far as we know only a few major textbook
companies in the United States publish companion volumes to their basic Wester
n and World Civilization texts that include collections of these primary
sources. Even so in most history survey courses, few students have time to
read these sources. The effects ripple out beyond the history classroom.
Students have no context in which t o place }{\i\fs24 A Passage to India,
}{\fs24 for example, no way of knowing that most of Forster's contemporaries
believed that Indians were racially different and more likely to be emotional,
panic driven, "wild." The could not know that "Read any of the Mutiny records;
which, rather than the }{ \i\fs24 Bhagavad Gita, }{\fs24 should be your Bible
in this country" (Forster 1924), a reference to the Sepoy Mutiny of 1857,
called up images in the English audience of women and children victimized by
barbaric, dark hordes of Indian men ready and eager to rape, kill, and mut
ilate white English women. Forster's allusions to that watershed event, go
unnoticed by most modern readers. \par }{\fs24\noproof0 Other classics of
Western literature have also been taught divorced from their context. English
majors during the 1960s and 70s were routinely assigned }{\i\fs24\noproof0
Heart of Darkness }{\fs24\noproof0 in introductory courses and British
literature surveys. Most were taught that it was a symbolic novel about a
psychological journey to the soul. Seldom was Leopold or the Belgian Congo
mentioned, yet Conrad intended }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Heart of Darkness}{
\fs24\noproof0 to be a book about Western imperialism. It may be more than
that, but Conrad himself, in the 1917 introduction to the novel, said, \'93 .
. . it is well known that curious men go prying into all sorts of places
(where they have no business) and come out o f them with all kinds of spoil
[read Leopold in the Belgian Congo]. This story, and one other, not in this
volume, are all the spoil I brought out from the centre of Africa, where,
really, I had no sort of business\'94 (Conrad 1917). Conrad\rquote s reading
public would easily have identified the situation in the Congo though Conrad
leaves it vague and unspecified in the novel itself. \par We have managed to
read and teach these pieces of literature in spite of de-\\-historicizing
them. And readers have made some sort of s ense of them, albeit incomplete.
But what happens when we move outside the Western tradition? How do we read
works of literature from other cultures without knowing the history of those
cultures? Can we read Pramoedya Toer's }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Buru Quartet
}{\fs24\noproof0 (1975\\_1988) withou t knowledge of Indonesian history,
including Dutch colonization, pan-Islamic movements worldwide, and Asian
revolutions that affect political nationalism in Indonesia? Can we understand
Minke's fascination with the Dutch, his sense of honor at being an H BS
student, his anger at being used as a kind of "guinea pig" to test Christiaan
Snouck Hurgronje's "Association Theory" unless we understand something about
the Dutch as colonizers? It is possible to understand Duong Thu Huong's
}{\i\fs24\noproof0 Paradise of the Blind }{\fs24\noproof0 (1988) unless we
know the long history of the Vietnamese struggle against the Chinese, the
French, the Americans? Does Hang's story make sense without a clear
understanding of what happened to Ho Chi Minh\rquote s dream after the
Americans left in 1975? Salman Rushdie's }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Midnight\rquote s
Children }{\fs24\noproof0 (1980) demands a clear understanding of Indian
history. Achebe, Soyinke, Emecheta cannot be read without Nigerian history and
culture. Achebe\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Things Fall Apart}{\fs24\noproof0
(1958), written on the eve of Nigerian independence, shows, in part, a clash
of cultures and the results of British imperialism. Without knowledge of how
the British worked in Nigeria, we do not understand Okonkwo\rquote s situation
nor do we understand why the Igbo world falls apart with the advent of British
missionary and eco nomic imperialism. We need to know about the differences
between Igbo culture and other Nigerian cultures to appreciate the ways in
which Okonkwo is an anomaly within his own community, to understand reasons
why the tribesmen embrace the missionaries as they move into Igbo territory.
Nor can we read Soyinke\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Death and the King\rquote
s Horseman}{\fs24\noproof0 (1975) without knowledge of Yoruba culture: the
entire first scene is indecipherable without it. We also need to know the
history of British-Yoruba relations to read the rest of the play. \par But we
need not go so far beyond our own borders. American students study American
literature without a very thorough knowledge of American history. And now that
anthologists are following Paul Lauter and the }{\i\fs24\noproof0 The Heath
Anthology of Am erican Literature }{\fs24\noproof0 in redefining the canon and
including minority and silenced voices, how do Americans read their own
literature without understanding the histories of Native\\_Americans,
African\\_Americans, Asian-\\- Americans, women, or immigrant groups? Can h
istory be relegated to footnotes in a good, standard text? It seems to us that
a fictional work loses much without a solid understanding of the history that
informs it and that this knowledge cannot be relegated to footnotes. \par If
we start with the assumptio n that the study of history is an explanation and
clarification of the past, that implicitly means knowing the cultural context
in which the events occurred. Records of these events and ideas by observers
and participants directly involved in them are as v aluable to students of
literature as records some distance removed from the events themselves either
in time or in space. Implicit in a source's proximity to or distance from the
events (historical, psychological, cultural, class, philosophical, etc) is t h
e notion of bias or distortion. Students of literature are trained to
recognize such bias in their study of narration. When they view history from
this perspective and compare various versions of an event, they are
reinforcing their understanding of point \\_of\\_view as well as gaining
insight into the true nature of history. If history is important to our
understanding of who we are, what we write, how we live, students need to come
to question history's sources. Is history simply a function of power\\_\\_ the
differential between those who write the texts and those who are silent (or
whose voices are silenced)? By not providing students \\- or ourselves as
"professional readers," the historical backgrounds needed to read fiction
well, are we not continuing to silence those other voices? \par Does the study
of history make us better teachers? Any time we have more knowledge about a
topic, surely, we can impart more knowledge to our students. And knowledge
about history allows us as English teachers to help students appreciat e the
text within a larger context\\_ the context of its contemporary production as
well as the context of its reading over time. Brook Thomas noted that "the
fragmentation of knowledge our students experience is so ingrained within the
institutional structur e of our universities, which in turn is so vitally
linked to our culture's social structure, that it would take a radical
restructuring of society to combat fully our students' lack of historical
consciousness" (Thomas 1991). Reuniting the study of litera t ure and history
would be a small step in combating the fragmentation. It would allow us to
help students come to an understanding of their own history and the history of
others in a way that makes the history come alive, makes it more personal to
them. Li terature has much to offer in this endeavor\\_\\_it has the potential
for making events of the past move from the dry dust\\_ bin of fact into real
events and real people with real emotions who are on either side of a
particular event. It allows students to see hi story not as a body of facts
but as an interpretive experience that changes with time and place. More than
this, it forces us to break the artificial boundaries of discipline and allow
ourselves to become more inclusive in our ways of knowing. It might en c
ourage collegiality as we reach out to colleagues in another field for help
and guidance in exploring this new discipline. It can also generate excitement
--most good teachers are good because they remain good students: they continue
to explore new ideas w ith relish and they feel a real passion for learning.
Incorporating the study of history into the study of literature can achieve
this. \par It becomes, therefore, incumbent upon those of us who believe that
the study of history is important to the study of lite rature to include a
variety of sources that examine events and individuals from a variety of
perspectives since the historical objectivity can never be ascertained but can
only be subjectively evaluated. Students cannot be left to read chapters from
tradi tional history textbooks, most of which gloss over events and do not
suggest the difficulties of perspective and bias. We can, certainly, choose
our texts based on the availability of \'93critical editions\'94 of the texts
that give historical background. But these are limited. \par What we are
suggesting is no small feat. It means that those of us who teach literature
must suddenly become \'93experts\'94 in the history and culture of the
literatures we teach. This may already exist for those professors teaching
upper division undergraduates and graduate students, those professors, that
is, who are teaching courses in their own fields. But how many of us teach
survey courses, introductions to literary genre courses, and other courses
that do not correspond to the par ticular fields we may have done our Ph.D.
comps in? Moreover, many of us may still fear that if we teach literature
historically we are relegating literature to the status of one more historical
object to be studied rather than "high art." \par Does this put an impossible
burden on those of us who teach literature? Perhaps. We spend enough time
preparing the text itself as well as reading the literary criticism that
surrounds the text as we prepare to present it in class. How are we to take on
another discipl i ne and know where to start. One answer is collaboration with
a colleague in History. We have paired our literature and history courses
around the theme of "encounter and imperialism" with great results. It allows
us to cover a world history post-1600 sur vey course while focusing on a topic
that connects the west with the world. We have taken four classes of students
through this cross\\_ disciplinary experience and they have been
overwhelmingly responsive. Student comments are typically positive: they are
rel ieved to be able to study history in a form that allows them to see how it
applies to real life people in real life situations (ironically in fiction).
They retained material because the two disciplines reinforced one another. One
student wrote. "Having s p ent a great deal of time over the past few months
reading works of authors of diverse backgrounds has been like taking a
refresher course in History. It has been an experience both painful and
necessary." Another student, who admitted at the start of the class that she
hated history and that she was absolutely ignorant of "anything that had
happened in the world\\_\\_ever\\_\\_ ," wrote us from the college she
transferred to: "I still catch myself remembering something I learned in your
class when I'm reading or doi ng something for other classes." Not only did
she learn the material, but she learned how one discipline is interconnected
with other disciplines and that the information she learned "actually makes
sense!" \par By putting our English and history classes together\emdash two
courses worth six credits scheduled back to back\emdash we have been able to
fill in these gaps in our knowledge. Having taught the course for five
semesters, we are constantly refining it, changing case studies and readings
as we ourselves learn more abo ut the topics we are teaching. Our latest
course syllabus (see appendix 1) reflects the kinds of case studies and
readings we work with. We try to cover all major geographic regions\emdash
Asia (India, Vietnam, later Indonesia), Africa (Egypt, Congo, later Nigeria),
and the Americas (internal colonization\emdash women, African Americans,
Native Americans, later the Caribbean). In so doing, we are careful to cover
the largest number of Western countries involved in imperialism\emdash
Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Belgium, and the United
States. We wanted students to see the colonial experience from the
perspectives of both the colonizer and the colonized. Finding works by Native
writers translated into English and available in the United States was a large
undertaking; and developing essay topics that combined both disciplines of
History and English was monumental. Some of the case studies presented us with
difficulties in choosing selections. When we do the Congo, for example, it is
fairly easy to find We stern works: Conrad\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Heart
of Darkness,}{\fs24\noproof0 E.D. Morel\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 White
Man\rquote s Burden,}{\fs24\noproof0 Roger Casement\rquote s studies, Mark
Twain\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 King Leopold \rquote s
Soliloquy}{\fs24\noproof0 , and George Washington Williams\rquote s reports on
the abuses of Leopold. But it has been very difficult for us to locate Co
ngolese literature in English; in fact, we have had to supply the Congolese
perspective with the writings of a French Congolese writer, Henri Lopes,
rather than writers from the former Belgian Congo. Moreover, we wanted to be
sure to choose texts that wo u ld tie into the history we were studying. So
although it might have been fun to do some of the contemporary Indian
novelists, Arundhati Roy or Jhumpa Lahiri, for example, whom many people are
reading today, we needed to find texts that would put the hist ory into a
personalized context for our students. Although there are a good number of
novels by Indian authors, for example, which would be useful, many of them
might be too long and difficult for a 100 or 200 level course. Salman
Rushdie\rquote s }{ \i\fs24\noproof0 Midnight\rquote s Children,
}{\fs24\noproof0 Gita Mehta\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Raj,}{\fs24\noproof0
Shashi Tharoor\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 The Great Indian
Novel}{\fs24\noproof0 \emdash these books take on too much for a survey course
in which we have all of three weeks to do the history and literature. So we
have used Forster as well as Stoppard (}{\i\fs24\noproof0 Indian
Ink}{\fs24\noproof0 ) in combination with a number of Indian short story
writers; this year we will leave out Stoppard and add Anand\rquote s
}{\i\fs24\noproof0 Untouchable }{\fs24\noproof0 to the list to see how well
the students respond. In the case of Indonesia, we have only enough time to do
the first volume of Pramoedya Toer\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 Buru
Quartet}{\fs24\noproof0 though we are clear that reading all four volumes
would be better. The good news is that many of our students like the book so
much they go on to read the rest of the tetralogy. \par }\pard \ql

{\fs24\noproof0 \tab History readings are even more difficult to select. To
date we have not found a text for any one of the case studies that gives a
thorough background of history and includes primary texts. We will try Stanley
Wolper\rquote s }{\i\fs24\noproof0 India }{\fs24\noproof0 this year. But in
the past we put together our own photocopied packet about 270 pages (see ap
pendix 2 for table of contents of this packet) of primary source readings we
thought would best represent the kind of study of India that we wanted to do.
Much of this packet we wrote ourselves, essays on the historical incidents and
background on inform a tion our students were unlikely to know (marked on
table of contents with asterisk). Other things we photocopied: these included
newspaper accounts and contemporary memoirs of historical events, reporting of
various incidents by Indian and English journa lists and historians. Some
selections we put on overhead rather than in the packets: }{\i\fs24\noproof0
Punch }{\fs24\noproof0 cartoons, photographs of events and people, and
contemporary engravings and painting. In any case, it is a time-consuming job
since we have not found texts that mix t he various kinds of readings together
in a way that we want to be able to use them. We have done and continue to
work on similar packets for each case study. \par }\pard \ql
\fi720\li720\ri720\sl480\slmult1\widctlpar\faauto\adjustright\rin720\lin720\itap0
{\fs24\noproof0 In addition, we attempt to pull our students into the cultures
of these areas not merely through the histories and the literature but also,
whenever possible, through art, music, food, and other cultural experiences.
We are luckily situated geographically and have been able to take our students
to a yearly gamelan concert at the Eastman School of Mu sic,
lecture/presentations at the Johnson Museum at Cornell in orientalism and
southeast Asian art and architecture, and performances of such plays as Wole

Unfortunately, such collaboration remains typically unsupported in the
academy. Why does its implementations seem to be so difficult? It is not
simply overcoming the usual inertia in academe but often facing outright
hostility from the very people who should be offering the most encouragement:
administration and other faculty. Our administration pays lip-service to the
concept of collaboration, but, with one or two notable exceptions, is
parsimonious in finding the appropriate time, m o ney, or classroom space for
such innovative encounters. Moreover we have no language in our contract to
address collaborative teaching ventures, so we paired two, three-credit
courses, back to back. This is workable within the honors program since all th
e students are advised by the honors coordinator. But we have discussed doing
a similar kind of course with non-honors students, and we know that scheduling
would be a nightmare. \par More than a question of money was a question of
time. In our community coll ege, we teach fifteen credit hours per semester,
many of us regularly teaching overloads. Finding the time to work with a
colleague is difficult. In our case, it consumes winter break, spring break,
and the entire summer. We find other difficulties even m ore challenging. The
breaking of disciplinary boundaries is seen as threatening to some; colleagues
question the legitimacy of a history professor talking about literature or a
literature professor commenting on history. They seem to fear the the integr i
ty of the courses will be lost. Yet we have been scrupulous in meeting
requirements of both disciplines; we have worked hard to find writing and
research projects that combine literary and historical perspectives. And when
we evaluate our students, we d o it together, having spent years working out
our standards and expectations both in and outside of our individual
disciplines. The result has been a sharper focus for each of us in all of our
classes and a clearer idea for our students about what academi c inquiry
involves. \par Although no students have dropped the course due to excessive
workload (and it is huge), there is occasionally an undercurrent of grumbling
that both workload and grading is severe. Nonetheless each year, student
evaluations are excellen t, and many students have returned after they
transfer to tell us how much they miss the course. And the few colleagues and
administrators who have been supportive, and some have vigorously supported
the course, remind us constantly how worthwhile our eff orts have been. The
irony is that academic, creative teaching is all that is being offered
here\emdash as well as a course that includes for the students guest
lecturers, field trips to local cultural events and exhibitions that tie into
the case studies, the food s from each of geographical areas studied, and a
close, well-defined learning community that brings students and faculty
together in a way they do not experience in other classes. It is a course
worth saving; it is also a course constantly under scrutiny. \par Both
administrative and peer support for such collaborations are essential if this
worthwhile educational experience is to be pursued. Faculty need time and
money for professional development and research. If we believe that combining
disciplines enhanc e s the teaching-learning process, we need a flexibility in
terms of disciplinary boundaries. Collaboration requires a commitment, a
passion, really, from two (or more) strong faculty members who are willing to
dismiss academic turf battles as irrelevant, who are willing to leave their
egos behind and become students in a mutual information-sharing process. And
last, there must be a chemistry that makes it work. Collaboration is not
simply team-teaching; it is more\emdash love of the discipline, the
profession, th e teaching-learning process itself. Unfortunately the teaching
of both literature and history divorced from one another has been a kind of
academic, intellectual Gradgrindism. Teachers of literature can use history to
give a depth to the readings of the texts they choose that could not be
achieved without the historical background. But more than this, most texts
remain, at least to a degree, indecipherable\\_-or at least incomplete\\_\\_
without such a background. Placing literary texts back into their contexts is
a major step. Coming to the literature with a true understanding of the
history of the culture that text came from can only help us read and interpret
the texts more fully. Although we are aware that administrative logistics and
campus politics often m ake an interdisciplinary approach or a collaborative
model difficult, we are convinced that pedagogically as well as theoretically,
such an approach is the best way to teach both history and English. \par
